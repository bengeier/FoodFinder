{"text":"Came here with my family a while back. Definitely some of the best thai food I've ever had. My absolute favourite meal is the green curry pad thai. It was genuinely something that I enjoyed really really thoroughly."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 pad thai from here. Was really decent. Bought a veg pad thai for my Persian friend, his first time eating it and he liked it. I ordered the chicken and shrimp with extra peanuts. I've eaten lots of pad thai and theirs is not too tangy like some other places."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. I only get it for take out. The restaurant has zero curb appeal but the food is quite good."}
{"text":"We have been going out our way to go here for lunch for a few years now.  Their lunch specials are reasonably priced and the food is consistently good.  My favorite dishes are their basis sauce with seafood and their pad see ew.    Yummy.  Would definitely recommend this place.  Service is really good as well.  The only reason I gave 4 not 5 stars is the soups I have tried have not been as enjoyable as the rest.  Still, we will be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered for the first time tonight. We were outside of delivery zone but with minimum $45 order they delivered. Thank god they did!! Pad Thai was fresh and authentic. Red curry was delicious but it as spicy as hoped! Signature platter was a great starter with super fresh mango salad. Top it off with FREE pad Thai for order over 50$ and deep fried bananas. Large portions with very reasonable prices. All dishes tasted like made with fresh ingredients....repeat customer 110% Would recommend to all.!! Absolutely pleased!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant!  Friendly staff, wonderful atmosphere, nice nature themed interior design, and amazing food.   Had Spicy shrimp pad Thai and mango curry was beautiful. Just enough spice for pad Thai, very smooth and fresh mango curry. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"I had reviewed this place before but deleted it due to inconsistency in my experiences here. we've have gone here many times b/c it is fast and close by.  However, i think recently new ppl took it over. There used be really nice guys that ran it and now it is all girls - not that i have anything against girls but it doesnt seem as good as it used to be. Last time i went there was a long hair on our spring rolls. we also ordered veggie and they brought chicken. the food is okay, but i've experienced better therefore 2 stars.  On a plus side - they always bring free deep fried bananas with maple syrup for dessert! Also, there's always space to eat and you never have to wait - just the food isn't that great."}
{"text":"Excellent Tom Yum and Crab Rangoon.  The Pad Woon Sen was solid as well. Service was good.  I would definitely go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"It's good for lunch! Haven't tried dinner yet... Coming from South East Asia, I can tell the taste is good but too many substitute ingredients... which is disappointing. I was hoping for a real Thai food, but as soon as I see broccoli its a bit off putting. But don't take me wrong their food is good, service is decent."}
{"text":"This is our favourite Thai place! We usually get fresh spring rolls and guy satay as appetizers. The take-out portions are really generous and I'd say two people could split a main dish. But why get one dish when the food is so tasty and the prices so reasonable? We usually get shrimp pad Thai and peanut curry chicken (+ coconut rice). The service is always friendly. We mostly order for delivery, but have eaten in the restaurant a couple of times too. The decor is nice and they've got large potted trees between tables...in the winter, you can pretend you've travelled to somewhere warm!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai restaurant.  All the curries are really delicious almost like the curry you can get in Thailand."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we have been to Thai Signature for dinner numerous times, and have left satisfied and happy. Unfortunately the last time was a very different experience. We went for a late lunch around 2:15. We quickly ordered. I ordered shrimp pad Thai, my sister the chicken green curry which were both off of their lunch special menu. My niece ordered pineapple fried rice which was not apart of their lunch special. The food came out quickly. My pad thai was fine. A little on the greasy side but still good. My niece's pineapple fried rice was weird looking. First off it was green!! We have never eaten pineapple fried rice that had a green colour to it. But we tried it. It wasn't terrible. Just not what we were used to. So we didn't complain. Now my sisters green curry on the other hand was hardly eaten. She told me to try it. All I could taste was salt!!! Like instead of a pinch they poured half a bottle. We told the waitress that the curry is not ediable. She took it back to the kitchen, and returned asking if we wanted the chef to fix it? How would you fix a dish that only tasted like salt? We replied no thank you and asked for the bill. So we were charged for full price of the green curry that was barely touched. We asked why? Her reply was because my sister had eaten the soup that came with the special. That makes no sense. The soup is an add on the main was not eaten. Needless to say we were not happy with the situation, and will not be returning."}
{"text":"The most delicious and authentic Thai food I've ever tried! Thanks to a friend who introduced me to this place. Prices are very reasonable environment is awesome too! Good service overall :)"}
{"text":"My hubby and I came out to run some errands and decided to stop by this restaurant for dinner. They give you a free Thai iced tea when you purchase an appetizer and an entree. We ordered the chicken spring rolls, basil pad Thai, and drunken noodles. The Thai iced tea was amazing! It tasted like a light dolce de leche drink with ice. The basil pad Thai was perfect. It wasn't spicy, but it wasn't too mild either. My husband had the drunken noodles which were spicy. It wasn't so spicy that we couldn't handle it, but just enough to maybe make you cough if you get the food down the wrong hole.   My husband is a big time foodie and is currently passed out in a food coma. If he's passed out, then I think this place deserves five stars. Service was friendly, but adequate.   Each dish is about $11 to $13 depending on the meat or veggie option you choose. The appetizers started at $5 and went up from there. All in all, it's a nice place to grab a bite of Thai cuisine. We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food and the place has nice ambiance/decor. Service was OK but took a while to get our food."}
{"text":"Beware when ordering takeout!!! If they miss something in your order here it is your problem to chase them down for it. Which in my experience included multiple calls and being hung up on by a manager. The food was good but an extremely disappointing customer service experience would make me very wary to return."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant based on the reviews....Decor is nice and calming.  For a Friday night, there were not a lot of people.....the door says they close at 9.30pm on a Friday!!    Chicken satay starter was good was good, and had lamb with lemon grass sauce...it was nice.....more vegetables than lamb though and Thai Green Chicken and shrimp was good.  I have had better Thai than this, so it was just OK for me, did not taste those Thai rich flavours. The servers are pleasant, but we were not offered a drink prior to them taking our food order.  All in all, a decent meal, decent surroundings, and a decent price just over $50 for two."}
{"text":"Great Thai food! Fresh, and delicious! Easily one of the best in Mississauga.  Dining in is better than take-out.   The green curry, peanut curry, and Pad Thai are all fantastic.   If you like your food spicy, you have to ask, otherwise you'll get food geared for North American palates."}
{"text":"Recently went to Thai Signature with some friends and was quite impressed. Having recently worked/lived in Thailand I am familiar with what Thai food should taste like and Thai Signature is authentic Thai. The decor is very nice and the service was very good with friendly staff. Prices were reasonable and the portions good. I will definitely go back again and will not hesistate to recommend the restaurant to friends."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from Thai Signature for years. Prior to about 6 months ago I would have said it was one of the 5 best Thai restaurants I've tried. Unfortunately they seem to have undergone some changes, and after several very bad orders I'm moving on - goodbye old friend.  Today while ordering three dishes I said the words \"very spicy\" 5 times. I felt like it was overkill, but based on recent experience I thought better overkill than bland food. My pad thai was about as spicy as ketchup, basil eggplant wasn't much better, and I could detect a hint of heat (2 on a 5 scale rating at other restaurants) in the curry. The curry used to come with chunks of fresh thai chili. Now I could see maybe 3 flecks of a jarred red chili paste.  Funny thing is, when I called to tell them this, I got met with an elaborate argument about how customers don't like when it's spicy and that's as spicy as they can make it... Great customer service huh? Then when I said the pad thai tasted like ketchup he said, oh yeah they didn't make that one spicy. As I said, I asked 5 times, once for each dish specifically, and then twice at the end of the order. I guess he thought I didn't mean that one."}
{"text":"It's a good spot. Everything I tried is tasty, and that includes curries, noodles, mango salad, etc. Eating in is nice, the restaurant is well decorated and I thought the service was pleasant. One time we ordered take out and the prices on their website did not match the prices we were charged. We inquired, and apparently the prices went up. I know it's just a few dollars, but it does bring the cost of what I want to spend for a take out meal over my limit, so I'm not in a hurry to go back. I get really annoyed when rice isn't included in the price of meals that require it (like curries), but Thai Signature is not the only place that pulls this nonsense off, so I can't really blame them."}
{"text":"Loved it . Tried their chicken pad Thai with a mango salad. The salad was great, I've never had that before"}
{"text":"Pad thai and soups are great.  Staff are friendly and accommodating.   When you ask for your spice level \"hot\" you get \"HOT\" and it's wonderful!"}
{"text":"Thai ice tea was delicious.  The food was all freshly prepared Light and excellent. Service was good. Will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the sign or strip mall location, this place has the best Thai in town (any town really). Had the pineapple red curry with coconut rice and it was amazing! Also tried the peanut curry, which was equally as good. For apps we ordered the Crab Rangoon and pumpkin soup both were yummy and just the right size. Happy to have this hidden gem in port credit, only wish I had discovered this place sooner..."}
{"text":"For Thai in Mississauga this is your go to spot. The Pad Thai is gluten free and was delicious. There menu tells you what is Vegan, Gluten Free. It is a great menu. Also had the Coconut Milk Soup, I am unsure if this is dairy free or not as I did not feel too well afterwards although I should have asked.   Overall, the food was very nice. My boyfriend has the Coffee Iced Tea which was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is my jam. I've eaten at Thai Signature more times than I can count (usually for work-related luncheons), and I've always been impressed by the quality of the food and service.  I almost always get the pad thai lunch special for $10, which comes with a spring roll, soup and a heaping scoop of pad thai with crushed peanuts, as well as a dessert depending on the day (either fried banana or melon). If in doubt, always go for the pumpkin soup - I consider it the best thing on their menu by far, and it always warms me up on a cold day.  I don't know what other people have experienced, but I've never had a problem with slow service. If anything, the staff is too overbearing - whenever I go, I usually get a short-haired waitress who practically hovers over me asking if I need anything. I even have a running gag/signal among my friends, where all I need to do is drink half my glass of water and set it out near the edge of the table, then she immediately runs over to refill it and ask if we need anything. I admire her diligence.  Capacity is usually hit-or-miss - I've come on some days to find it absolutely barren at lunchtime, and packed at the same time on other days. Still, I love it, and wholeheartedly recommend it for anyone who's looking for a good Thai restaurant in Port Credit."}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying I have been here many times and every time it has gotten worst and worst.   When I first came here I was extremely happy as I have been to Thailand and the food here was the closest to the real thing.  My first experience was of well cooked food, very flavorful and overall excellent.   My favorite was the chicken satay with Peanut Sauce.  Slightly crispy but very juicy. Today I ordered and they were under cooked, tasteless and I will go with gross. I was not impressed.    The  coconut shrimp was just as bad. Soggy and horribly tasteless! You couldn't even tell it was suppose to be coconut. So disappointing.   Only good thing we ordered was the garlic Shrimp with broccoli.   I'm so disappointed with this restaurant now. I will not be returning or recommending this place to anyone anymore."}
{"text":"Great glass noodle soup and spring rolls! The waitress was friendly and it was a nice atmosphere! There weren't many people there when I went but it made for a quiet environment.   The Pad Thai was tasty, it's a good Thai restaurant. Nothing spectacular but if you're feeling Thai I'd recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"After reading the excellent reviews we decided to check out the Thai Signature restaurant in Port Credit. We were very impressed with the decor, service and especially all of the dishes we ordered. The Signature appetizer platter was varied and well-balanced with grilled chicken satay, spring rolls ( both fresh and fried) , wontons, mango salad and was served with three different dipping sauces. I ordered chicken pad thai and my husband ordered the curry pad thai. The curry pad thai had a rich coconut taste and was unlike the Indian curry flavour that he expected.  Both of these dishes were delicious and the servings were large, so large that I brought half of mine home. We will definitely be returning and spreading the word about this hidden gem in a Port Credit strip mall."}
{"text":"The staff was very welcoming. Loved the tasty mango salad and green curry. Portions were good sizes."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a tiny plaza on Lakeshore is Thai Signature. Being a Thai rookie myself, I blindly followed the lead of my friend, who swore it was the best Thai restaurant. Her words.  The interior looks like something that doesn't belong in that plaza. Just flat out relaxing and non-intrusive in every sense. The server was very sweet and helpful, probably giving in to the \"Holy hell please help me\" deer-in-headlights expression I had, not having any idea what to expect. I ended up selecting the Pad Thai with chicken.  Gad-zooks! I can't properly express how delicious it was. My friend had the Pad Thai with veggies, and loved it as well. We also ordered a dessert. The name of it escapes me, but it was basically a big, warm, coconut-rice 'brain', with slices of mango surrounding it, which was also ridiculously good. To top everything off, as we'd just started talking for a while after the food, the waitress was nice enough to bring us another snacky dessert, free of charge. Well, now they're just trying to make me fall in love *blush*  Intimate atmosphere, amazing food, wonderful service. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This place could easily be 4 stars for me if the dishes weren't so salty. We ordered the basil pad Thai, bass fillet with cashew nut sauce (breaded btw) and pineapple fried rice. It was amazing the first couple of bites then the salt really started to settle... Service was good and atmosphere is nice!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Thai, must try - iced tea, spicy pad Thai, green curry, and satay chicken. Crispy spring rolls were fantastic too! Mango salad - very refreshing."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is definitely a hidden gem. We were looking for a Thai restaurant in the west end with another couple. I found this place from Yelp and called them for reservations.  Upon our arrival at the restaurant we were surprised it was empty with only one other table.  We ordered their mixed appetizer and it was very good variety and tasty.  Their pad Thai was soooo good the best I've had.  My husband ordered the stir fry Bangkok noodles and it was very good with generous amounts. Our friends ordered curry and said it was very flavourful.  We would highly recommend this place if you're in the area looking for Thai food."}
{"text":"Nice place, good service...we had a variety of food, and thai beer available."}
{"text":"We had red veggie curry, coconut soup, green curry and deep fried ice cream. Everything except ice cream was excellent and so was the service.  Thank you, it was a great lunch!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Found it by luck 15 yrs ago when we lived in Port Credit. We moved to Erin Mills 10+ years ago and still make the trip."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in the Oakville/Mississauga area. Fried veggie roll are excellent. Papaya salad is good. Good quiet place in Port Credit. Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty authentic and probably better than most thai places in Mississauga. We had their appetizer platter and it was gigantic and full of goodies. Their fresh rolls weren't soggy and the veggies inside were still crispy. The crispy wontons were crunchy and the sweet chili sauce it came with was a good combo.  As with all thai restaurants I think their pad thai is a good tell on their authenticity and this one was pretty on point. Their chili sauce was pretty good as well and my friend really enjoyed their curry and said it had a good kick to it.  The one complaint I have is their service. It was very weird... i made reservations as I always do and when we showed up a waiter pointed at a corner table for us and said he needed to wipe it. He wiped it and went into the back... meanwhile a waitress comes to the front and instead of seating us, talks to the family behind us. So I though they must have spoken to each other and knew he was helping us... apparently not because she then sat the family at the corner table the waiter just cleared off for us. X_x  We finally get seated and while I was checking in I saw a free thai ice tea offer so asked while we ordered to redeem it. Our waiter looked confused and didn't respond and just walked to the back... at this point I'm a little confused and then 25 minutes later half way through our meal the waitress comes to us and asks me if I wanted the thai ice tea... either they have a weird system or they were just really unorganized. When our bill came, we received the wrong one and when we brought it to the waiter's attention he asked us if we were sure it was wrong?!?!? He didn't seem to know what we ordered even though it was in front of him.  Overall still enjoyed our meal and the service wasn't rude... was just odd. I'd go back if I was craving some thai goodies in the suburbs!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. I've had better for the same price.   Positives: 1. I tried the coconut soup with chicken - which was the best dish I ordered (in my opinion, but might just be because it was different than anything I've ever had) 2. The red curry with chicken was also good but I've had much better (could just be a personal preference as I prefer my thai curries to have more kick to them, and this one didn't have one) 3. The grilled salmon was good. Nothing extraordinary. But cooked well and well seasoned. 4. The environment inside was good. Looked neat and clean. Negatives: 1. The drunken noodles was not good ( In my personal opinion. I'm sure there are otherd who love it) 2. The environment outside was not the best (but honestly does that really even matter?) 3. You have to pay extra for rice, even if you buy a curry. 4. The portion sizes were kind of small, compared to other Thai restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"It was very good, the food was delicious except they didn't have the Thai tradition grilled chicken."}
{"text":"Ordered take out here several times over the past five years. It's just not very good. The food is very bland, everything is near colourless and tasteless.   Try Taste of Thailand at dundas and kipling, similar place but with far better food. As an example, I sometimes get the basil fried rice with beef for lunch at TOT, it's pretty damned good. Just ordered it from Thai Signature and it's got no spice at all, it's a pale whiteish colour and is generally quite rubbish.   Just not good enough."}
{"text":"Fast service and tasty food. Pad Thai was nice. Free Thai ice tea when you order 1 appetizer and 1 main course definitely nice. Ordered mango salad for appetizer."}
{"text":"The dining environment is always peaceful and quiet. The BGM is soft and it's a good place for couples or family to have meal together. Each dish has decent amount of food for two if diners order a side appetizer.   They do have a promotion that if diners order an appetizer with a main course, a free Thai ice tea will be provided. It's cold and a bit sweet. The ice tea is an amazing match for the food here since it provides totally different tastes from the taste of curry and Thai sauce.  If you never had Thai food in the past, I suggest you to get the Basil Fried Rice or just the Pad Thai to start with."}
{"text":"Service was okay but they got the bills mixed up. Food came out quickly. Servers were attentive. It's nice to see some coconut rice on the menu. Not all thai places seem to have this basic dish. The green curry was okay.   The meal finished with some deep friend banana dessert on the house. That was pretty good."}
{"text":"I feel quiet disappointed writing this review as my husband and I have eaten here and ordered from Thai signature quiet often. This past week we ordered in two currys (pineapple curry and red curry) and to our surprise got really sick. I had to throw my whole meal out as the chicken was pasty and tasted nothing like chicken. The sauce has a weird consistency and color and altogether smell. When we called the restaurant to bring up our concerns they were already closed. Two days later and we re both suffering from stomach problems still."}
{"text":"Nice decor/ambiance, good choice of dishes, well prepared and tasty. Had mango curry today. Reasonably priced ave 11-12 bux. They play mixed soothing Thai (I think...) music and smooth jazz - cool! Friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Ok place. The food wasn't as good. There are better options around. I had their drunken noodles."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place on a Friday night. We got there and there was a fair enough of people but it wasn't too busy. We got seated right away and waters were brought out. Our table was wobbly and our server noticed this. He suggested we move over to a bigger table (there was only 2 of us) and he even carried our waters for us! Props to that service!  We ordered the chicken spring rolls, drunken noodles and yellow curry.  The spring rolls were delicious! The crispness of the wrapper was perfect. Our mains came out not too long after. My friend's drunken noodles were good but REALLY spicy. So if you like spicy, get this. The heat doesn't really hit you till you stop eating, so you have to keep eating for it to be enjoyable lol. My yellow curry was pretty good. The portion was just right for me because I actually finished all the chicken and rice. I never do that.  I'd return to this place but try something different. Their menu has a lot of selection!"}
{"text":"It's a good restaurant,soups were ok,pad Thai was good,lemon fish was good,green courey was ok"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place while walking through port credit, everywhere had a long wait but we found this place to have enough room for us... Very welcoming, amazing food! The staff were lovely and helpful.  Definitely get a soup to start especially when it's cold out (lemongrass was excellent) and curry was fantastic. The beef wasn't as tender as some Thai places I've been so if recommend chicken instead. Overall very happy"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Thai food in the West end, I would highly recommend this restaurant. The service, food and ambiance was wonderful!  We arrived on a Saturday night around 8pm and the restaurant was full. I asked to be put on the waiting list and waited no more than 20 minutes. We ordered their signature platter, this platter provides you with a sampling of their appetizers. It included their spring roles, fresh roles, mango salad and dumplings. Everything tasted fresh and well seasoned. My favorite was their mango salad, the mango was the perfect ripeness and not soggy which told me that it was made that day. I ordered their red curry for my entree and my boyfriend ordered their pad thai. They are one of the few places that I know that can cook pad thai using tamarind sauce. The flavor is more tangy. The red curry was seasoned well, had a good kick and had equal portions of vegetables and meat. They also have a great selection of asian beers, wine and dessert."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great hidden gem. Try the signature platter! Drunken noodles are great too!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! My husband and I went for a date night midweek, it wasn't that busy which was good for us. I can only imagine how this place would be during the weekend.  Ambience was nice and decor was decent. The food came fairly quickly once we ordered. Everything  we ordered was delicious! Would definitely return and recommend"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch last week with my mom and we were pleasantly surprised. The food was fresh, delicious and authentic. Can't get much better than this. Lunch specials are worth every penny! Try the pad thai and pumpkin soup yum yum !"}
{"text":"This place has good food, quick service, descent portion sizes. The food comes out quickly. Lots of gluten-free and vegetarian options. Garlic chicken with broccoli has lots of flavor, the glass noodles could use a little more flavor but were good none the less."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight. Had the Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp. Delish!!  The best that I've ever had. Service was excellent. Will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Gorgeous place. Tasty food. Friendly people. Definitely worth every dollar spent."}
{"text":"We went there on Saturday evening. It was fairly packed with a couple empty tables and we were seated promptly.  We some starters, soup and some of their signature dishes. It was served right away. We really like the food. It was presented nicely and and tasted awesome. They really have a lot of vegetarian options.   Unlike other Thai restaurants Thai Signature has nice ambiance and offers class without compromising food."}
{"text":"I visited Signature Thai for lunch, having had take out before only which I enjoyed I thought I was in for a good meal.   To begin with the service isn't very good, the lady who served us didn't really speak English so it made it quite hard when we asked for suggestions. She even refused to give me the free Thai Iced Tea when you check in. As I already had a sweet drink before I went in it didn't really matter much.   When we ordered we went with the Thai Basil  Noodles and the Thai Red Curry.   The noodles were a little too salty for our liking, I've had Thai Basil before and it's never been that salty.   The curry was okay but lacked flavour that the dish should have.   Both the dishes sported extremely small quantities which unfortunately really made it feel like a rip off as we also both left hungry."}
{"text":"Great place for Thai food. I ordered the peanut chicken lunch special that came with a veggie spring roll and mango salad while the gf ordered the chicken pad thai. Everything was very fresh tasting and the portions were a good size. Finished the meal with an excellent mango sticky rice. Will come back to try the other specials."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  Port Credit should be privileged that they have a Thai restaurant within walking distance. I know it's located in a rather sketchy plaza, but the interior of this restaurant is definitely on the upscale end.  I decided to not order my usual pad thai when I come to Thai restaurants here, as I noticed the pad see eiw attracted me more. I decided to order that instead, with came with a lemongrass soup and spring roll.  The lemongrass soup and spring roll came rather fast. Both tasted very good! A small complaint for the spring roll would be that it's not crispy enough and too dark, but that's just my personal preference of a light crispy skin; similar to what I'm used to in dim sum restaurants. The pad see eiw also tasted very good, especially the sauce they used. The portions at first didn't seem big, but believe me it actually took a while for me to completely finish it. The wide noodles would be cooked a little less as they were breaking apart quite easily, but I do understand wider noodles are easier to break than your regular pad thai noodles.  Service was good; the employees will fill up your water/tea without you asking. However the food was a bit slow in coming out despite the fact the restaurant was only half full when I arrived. Do budget about an hour here if you're coming with a group during lunch."}
{"text":"Food were great, HOWEVER, service was slow. The food came out in an ok time length but when I wanted to get my bill, it took forever.   There were 3 waitresses and only about 5 tables of customers with avg of 4 ppl per tables. All 3 waitresses went into the kitchen for not sure what reason....They came out and went back in as fast as lighting. After, the table behind us complaint that they ordered brown rice but wasn't here on their table, and their main dish was getting cold. After the complaint, the waitress quickly went into the kitchen and got them a plate of brown rice. The customers also wanted to reheat their plate of food because it got cold.   Guess what....3 waitresses went into the kitchen again just to heat up this ONE plate of food which took about 5 min. I was sure that they used the microwave which had nothing to do with the 3 waitresses, but why everyone who was working went into the kitchen to help out? Simply put it this way, they probably need all the team of workers to just operate this simple microwave :)  Anyhow, I was trying to find one of the three waitresses to get my bill, but can't get a hold of them. Apparently, a gentleman stood up from another table and walked to the counter to just paid his bill. Great service RIGHT?"}
{"text":"Owners for this establishment has changed again. Renovations are nice.   We walked in around 9pm to be told that the kitchen closes at 9.30pm, our bill was on our table by 9:13pm.   Rude!  Food was ok, but considering there are three other thai places in the area, will not be venturing here again."}
{"text":"Some of the staffs were rude and not friendly at all. When i asked for the wifi password they simply said \"no\" and walked away. Then when i asked why, they explained it gets slow when people use it, so i assume they dont give out password cause they wanna use it all for themselves but not the customers. Food was good but a little overpriced. I really like and recommend the fried calamari, the best I've had. Good atmosphere and decorations. Will come back, just for the fried calamari and thai tea."}
{"text":"The western style of Thai food. The atmosphere is nice but it doesn't offer an authentic Thai food as what we expected. We went to this place awhile ago.  The food are bland in general and we are not impressed at all. We start going to the other Thai restaurant on the same street now. It becomes our favourite Thai food restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good Thai restaurant. We found this little gem on Yelp, and so glad we tried it out. The place was clean, the staff was friendly and the food was hot and delicious. Their Pad Thai was amazing, not many Thai places know how to prepare delicious noodles, but this was perfect. Also their Pineapple Curry was so tasty and flavourful. Definitely a place to come back again.. and again."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere was great and the quality of food is so yum. I will definitely be back to order more of the food as I've only tried the Pad Thai as of yet."}
{"text":"Pumpkin soup and spicy beef salad are great! Very friendly service also. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Thai Signature is a pretty solid place for Thai food in Port Credit!  The lunch special is an absolute steal. You have your choice of entree (10 options), your choice of side (4 options) and a veggie spring roll. The portions are HUGE. Any time I've gotten the lunch special, it inevitably ends up being my dinner as well.   The menu is quite expansive - there is something here for everyone! I must admit I have only ever had the veg & tofu Pad Thai. It's good, a bit salty and I would like to see them take the spice factor up a notch. I did notice lots of vegan and vegetarian friendly menu items. I'll have to branch out one of these days!   The service is always friendly and efficient and the decor has a very authentic vibe to it.   Thanks Thai Signature!"}
{"text":"Where to begin....  My dining experience has always been exceptional, whether I'm picking up my order or dining at the restaurant.  The staff are all wonderful and thoughtful, always making sure that I've been taking care of. Even during rush hours, they go out of their way to make sure that their diner is taken care of.   I first started coming here to buy the perfectly priced and delicious lunch specials, with a wide variety choices. After 4 years I've had EVERYTHING on the menu and still cannot get over how delicious everything always is. These chefs put their soul in each dish and it shows.   My absolute favourite dishes: Chicken Red Curry with jasmine rice Even writing this is making my tastebuds dance! FRESH ingredients,popping with colour and flavour. There's a harmonious balance with each ingredient, in every bite you get that richness and body. Superb!  Seafood Salad Beautiful presentation,gorgeous aroma and bursting with flavour. The zestiness  of the dressing/sauce is amazing.  Each piece of seafood is perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. Just heavenly!  Thai Spicy Noodle Gorgeous luscious rice noodles enveloped in that spicy basil curry sauce is outstanding. I've tried it with every protein and vegetarian and it is simply delicious!  Sticky rice with pineapple is just heavenly and indulging! So much better than a typical chocolate mousse!  The Fried Banana is another favourite, perfectly fried and seasoned, the honey sauce served warm is to die for!  I hope this review helps you!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm happy to report that there is a decent Thai place in Mississauga. Thai Signature offers a wide variety of dishes at reasonable prices. We stopped by there for lunch a couple of weeks ago. We had calamari and satay chicken as appetizers and chicken Pad Thai and spicy basil stir fry as main dishes. We were very happy with our food and the service (the owner is super nice). Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from here in an attempt to get away from the regular few gfree options out there. What a great choice!!  First I will note that they have a gluten (and nut) friendly menu with items labelled with a nut or wheat symbol beside them if they contain that ingredient. That being said, we wanted the satay appetizer (that was listed as gluten free) and were told that it actually contained gluten. Same with the chicken rice wrap rolls. That was disappointing and I hope in the future they get some gfree soy sauce to make the appropriate changes or change how those items are listed. Anyways, if you order $50 you get free delivery, so we really went for it. We ordered the spicy beef salad and holy moly was it ever spicy. I really wish I'd asked for a toned down version because it was SO good but I just couldn't handle the burning!!  Next I had the pumpkin soup - thick, so flavourful and delicious. Very very savoury. I could only eat half that night. My husband had the coconut soup with shrimp. (Both were gfree btw) his soup was so tasty (coconut!!) but HOT!! This started my second running around the kitchen gulping down water dance of the night. His was not thick at all and had lots of mushrooms in it. It didn't look too appetizing but damn it was good!  We both ordered pad Thai. It isn't listed as being gfree on the menu, but they were able to make mine gfree (I think just by eliminating the tofu). I really enjoyed it and pretty much inhaled almost all of it. My husband had the green curry noodle and really enjoyed it. They are all able to have an addition of beef, chicken, veggie/tofu, pork, seafood or shrimp for a very nominal additional fee. It was $1 more to add beef to my pad Thai (I have a problem with how much I love red meat).  Overall the food was great, the delivery time was within an hour, the quality of the food was high (and you can really tell with the meats and how lean they were). My only disappointment was the misinformation on the appetizers. This will definitely be added to our delivery roster!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai place in the area. Prices are very good and the staff is always nice and attentive, you'll never have an empty glass of water. I've tried almost everything on the menu and it's all good. The Green Papaya salad is my favourite, it's spicy and refreshing at the same time, so good. Get a \"Thai Style\" Pad Thai for the best results. Also give the deep fried ice cream a shot for desse rt, it's great. If you want Thai in this area this is the spot. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! It's close to my apartment... the food has consistently been tasty and the prices are reasonable. Definitely worth a try! Their crab rangoon is awesome and I love the green curry. The duck is also very good!"}
{"text":"Visited this place almost with no clue of it ! Great signature dishes ! The pineapple fried rice was absolute delicacy ! The coconut soup was delectable ! No regrets dropping in ! But the price for the quantity was a bit on the higher side I would say !!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years, it never disappoints. Favorites: green curry, mango curry, lemongrass sauce, PUMPKIN SOUP!!!!!! We aren't meat eaters so I cant comment on that, but vegan and vegetarian preferences are always accommodated. The menu indicates allergens in each dish, so for anyone with dietary concerns they have done a GREAT job :)"}
{"text":"I go here because it's right next door to the office and they are pretty quick with takeouts.   I haven't been impressed with the food to say the least. On the most recent visit, I got a Pad Thai that was 90% noodles and 10% other. It was also very greasy and slimy. There was no flavour to it whatsoever only heat from the chillies. I wouldn't even need to take into account their failure to include my mango salad with the order to justify the 2 stars.   Vomitrocious"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant with tropical decorations and great service. Curry pad Thai was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Great thai food in Oakville but a little overpriced. Great ambiance, not what you'd expect from a typical Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"A Thai restaurant in Port Credit? That's out of the ordinary, so I had to try it. The employees of the restaurant were Asian, so they had that going for them. The restaurant is really large inside, but I was one of the only two patrons there.  The menu is fairly large. I generally go for Pad See Ew when I'm at Thai restaurants, but it was pretty difficult to find on their menu because the dish is named Soya Noodle. So I ordered the Soya Noodle and a Thai Iced Coffee. The coffee tasted a little odd. It had a hint of fragrance that I couldn't place. The pad see ew was just okay. I think the taste was modified for Western palates. The service was good, but I was placed at a table close to the front of the restaurant so the wait staff had to walk long distances to refill water.  I was hoping for a lot more, given the high ratings on Yelp. But I've definitely had better Thai food. I doubt that I will return even if I was in the area."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  If you haven't tried already, when you go to a Thai restaurant, try their Thai iced tea! It's on the sweeter side though so ask them to go easy on the sweet milk! It's definitely very delicious though.   I liked this restaurant because of the unique curry they had. Duck curry - not really found in many Thai restaurants so if you make the trek out here to try this restaurant, you definitely want to try it. The only shortcoming was the curry was not that flavourful though. When it came to the table, the curry was also somewhat cold so I had to ask them to heat it up.   I also tried the chicken satay skewers. The peanut sauce was nicely done however I thought the skewers were okay and a bit on the dry side. Perhaps it's the section of the chicken or quality of the chicken they used, I thought it was on the drier side. If a thigh meat or the drumstick side of the meat was used on the skewer, the taste might have been even juicier.   I also tried their pad Thai. I liked the pad Thai because I like my pad Thai with more sauce in it and they definitely perfected that. Each bite was full of a right mix of noodle and sauce.   Service is generally very slow here though. I'm not sure about the kitchen but there were about two servers running the whole floor of guests. Sometimes a request would take them awhile before they can get to it. ( ex. Asking for take out containers to fill the leftover food).    LAST TIP!?  Check in at this restaurant when you come to unlock the free Thai iced tea..with the purchase of an appetizer and a main though! But the Thai iced tea is def worth a try though!"}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai I have had so far. I keep coming back for it and it's just amazing. I can never decide between the veggie or seafood one. I would definitely recommend to go with the Original Thai Style because the regular one is basically just adding ketchup to it ( still good ). What I love about this place is that everything just tastes so fresh, I am not big on salad but when my wife orders the Thai Salad it's just amazing. You would think they just picked the veggies out of their backyard.  I usually just order take out so I am not sure about service but they always seem very nice and friendly. So if you are looking for a good Pad Thai this is your place in Mississauga!   With my last order they gave me a free spring roll and I wasn't too impressed with it though. It seemed like it was just all wrapper but no filling."}
{"text":"An average Thai restaurant at best... we got the pad Thai, not bad but I wish we had been offered the option of getting it a bit spicy. The curry duck was good, but only because of the curry, the duck wasn't really worth it. DO NOT order any of the grilled stuff, it's all just stir-fried and completely over priced for what you get. Service was okay, nice but unattentive, couldn't get her attention and never once came to ask us if we wanted anything else or if the food was okay. Not terrible but definitely nothing special; food was also a bit cold. May come back if I'm in a pinch nearby, but probably not, otherwise."}
{"text":"The red curry was very subpar for a Thai restaurant, especially since it lacked flavour. My friend's pad Thai was drowned in some soupy liquid. Last time I checked pad Thai was noodles and not soup. A definite avoid."}
