{"text":"Easy to order online using BeyondMenu, delivery is on time and food is always hot & delicious.  Great coupons, free egg rolls with $10 purchase.  Delivery person is courteous. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Too much vegetables, not enough meat.  I did like their chow mein.  I ordered bourbon chicken, sesame chicken, house fried rice and seafood combo.  They forgot to give me my drink on the seafood combo.  Didn't bother going back for it.  Could hardly understand person on the phone taking my order and he was rude about it too. No offense,  but his accent was so dense, wish he put someone else on the phone who wasnt so easily flustered. Thx for reading."}
{"text":"First time here with some friends and it was super delicious. I tried broccoli beef, cashew chicken, Kung Pao chicken, string bean chicken and fried rice. I also ordered salt/pepper wing as an appetizer. Soup and egg rolls were also yummy. All items were made fresh to order. The kitchen is open and can be seen from your table. If in town you must try this place, so worth it. Prices were average but well worth it since it is very well served with plenty to share if eating with a group. Service was great, the young man there was very helpful and knowledgeable and made great suggestions."}
{"text":"Great food! I usually go to another Chinese food place but this place is closer to me so I figured id give it a try and im glad I did. I will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome! 

They have your typical Chinese fare. Great prices and massive portions. Ordered delivery and eaten at the store, great experience! Their portions last me 2 dinners and a lunch! Great place for inexpensive yummy Chinese food!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Chinese food, but this was close to my work so I took a chance. I just ordered an individual dinner(Mongolian beef) right now and it got here in 15 minutes, hot, and nothing missing. It was pretty delicious also. When I was too busy to answer the door, the delivery guy notified me he was there, to make sure I got my food, even though I had prepaid. I will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"VERY GOOD! This reminds me of the Chinese food back East, if not better. I didn't get anything that I wouldn't eat again. Not to bad pricing & the delivery was really really fast & the driver very friendly. This is definitely my new Chinese food."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here before (pick up).. but I don't think I will be again.. today was delivery. . I always get the general tso extra spicy with some extra sauce... not even spicy and hardly any sauce on the chicken. .borderline dry! And I guess I should  have said PACKET duck sauce the one they make is nasty... smdh"}
{"text":"We tried the Mu Shu Chicken, Cashew Chicken and Crab Rangoon - excellent!!!  Friendly and polite service."}
{"text":"Affordable, awesome service, portion size, and very friendly staff.  China Hot Wok is outstanding...had the kung pao shrimp and it was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I had the tomato beef and the pad Thai...
And a honeydew boba slushy...
All of which was delicious!  Delivered piping hot in 15 minutes fast!!!"}
{"text":"Ate at this restaurant twice in the past 2 weeks. Great food, generous portions and good service. Worth the trip if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place based on previous reviews... I have to say I am very pleased with everything!!!! The people were nice the Orange chicken and teriyaki chicken were amazing! The egg rolls were a decent size and very good also I really wish I would have tried there noodles but I got chicken fried rice!! But it was so good I didn't even need to add soy sauce so I'll just have to try the noodles next time!! Yum yum yum very delicious will definitely be ordering there again!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Dined in after a 10 mile hike. Ordered Salt & Pepper Shrimp for myself & Ma-Po Tofu for my wife along with 2 orders of vegetable spring rolls(2 per order @ only $1.98 per order). Expecting regular salt & black pepper shrimp I received salt & a chili pepper shrimp which was delicious & had a little kick to it. My wife said her tofu was fresh tasting & spicy & one of the best she's ever had. Ordered to go tonight & again----amazing! They said it would be ready in 10 minutes & it was when I walked in the door 10 minutes later."}
{"text":"Everything they serve is amazing! My boyfriend and I are addicted to this place. Everyone there is sweet and efficient. They are always busy and they always make sure to take care of you. The food, the portions, and the staff are awesome!"}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. I order from them every week and the food is consistently good. I always order the bbq pork fried rice and an appetizer. The people who work there are incredibly nice and get my orders out quickly. I highly recommend checking them out!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, delicious food. Got everything correct in our take out order. Eggplant and tofu was really good!!!"}
{"text":"We have had two deliveries and both were perfect. This is now who we call for Chinese food. Very easy to order online."}
{"text":"Disgusting!!! It deserves no stars Ian HIGHLY disappointed! Real Chinese white rice is sticky not Minute Maid rice! The Orange chicken wasn't even chicken who knows what that was & not to mention the beef was chewable for at least 10 mins! I will NEVER spend a penny there again! GROSS!! Could of went to Panda and got the same disgusting Chinese for cheaper!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite local Chinese restaurant. Excellent taste, large portions, friendly people, overall a great place with really good food and very reasonable prices. The Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken and combo fried rice were excellent. They deliver within a 6 mile radius. We will definitely be ordering for home and come back in to sit down for dinner. A great find."}
{"text":"Salt and pepper shrimp. YUUUUUMMM but the description said crispy and it wasn't :( but still sooooo YUMMMMMMY"}
{"text":"Recently delivered food luke warm almost cold, they must have been super busy due to there delicious food. Other than that ive always been satisfied with there service."}
{"text":"I like individual dinner. It comes with 1 item, cup of soup, rice or noodle,  and a egg roll. It is only $10. It is more than 1 person can eat. I share with grandma who live with us. It is cheaper and tastier than anything around here. We order take out about once a week. Good busy  day dinner item."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered the individual meal for carry out. I choose the egg drop soup, crab wontons, and General Tso's chicken.  The portions were generous. The food quality was similar to less than your average Chinese Buffett.  You'd be better off getting Panda Express, unless you're craving soup."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing! Big portions for very good prices. The food was incredible and the service was awesome! Really kind, genuine people. Get the Singapore Noodles!"}
{"text":"1 hour delivery (average), combination chow mein was alright if it wasn't for the chicken which was inedible. Also forgot my Coke! So I guess the drivers just gets an extra $1 tip    Probably won't order from there again even though they did seem to give me a lot of crab rangoons."}
{"text":"Ordered food for 4:45 PM and they show up at my house around 12 noon. I get a call from delivery stating no one answered then i explained what time my receipt said, so he hung up on me. The restaurant immediately calls and hangs u p on me after I told him to cancel my order. So I call back and ask for a rund and was told to call BEYOND MENU. Called BEYOND MENU and had to leave a message. They called back but stated they had to call the restaurant to confirm cancellation and that my bank should verify being charged twice since they only show 1 order being place. JUST ALL AROUND REDICULOUS. Such a shame because it's close to my home."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in their wor wonton soup. It had no flavor. It was traditionally made, meaning if you got it in Asia it would every similar but broth was REALLY bland. 
Also had the beef broccoli and again seasonings were missing....very bland. Same with egg rolls. :("}
{"text":"I love this place the food is awesome the portions are large, they deliver in under thirty minutes. If you get the family meal for 30.00 it comes with three entrees, rice, a very large soup, egg rolls and wontons."}
{"text":"The food is always hot and fresh. I haven't been disappointed once, and I've been there at least ten times. Shrimp Chow Mein is one of my favorites from here. They throw in free stuff when you order a certain amount of food, from some egg rolls to rangoons to Chinese donuts, there are plenty of choices. Staff is always super friendly and always smiling. The restaurant is always clean and inviting! Sometimes it takes a bit to get your food but you know it's made as soon as you order it! They've earned and kept my business."}
{"text":"It was decent.  They messed up my order slightly, but overall I will try them again.  They were though, very quick on delivery, which I appreciated."}
{"text":"Wow, just got my delivery from China Hot Wok! It was so fresh, so hot and soooo
good.  This spot is definitely my new \"go to\" for Chinese delivery! I got the salt and pepper chicken and shrimp and the shrimp fried rice.  My husband got a chicken dish which he has not yet eaten, but it looks delicious! So glad I decided to try China Hot Wok!"}
{"text":"The wife and I visited this business today at around 2:15 pm.  Only one other couple eating in.  We were greeted immediately by the young lady behind the counter.  Upon learning we were going to eat in, she asked us to pick a seat and she came over to our table.

She took our drink orders and came back immediately to take our food order.
We opted for General's chicken, Hong Kong crispy noodles and one order of their pot stickers.  I tried to order the Hong Kong dish as an individual dinner as it comes with egg rolls, soup and choice of rice, but it was not one of the choices.  Our very friendly waitress advised that she would bring a free soup and a free order of egg rolls anyway.

The wife said the General's chicken was very good and my Crispy Hong Kong noodles were spectacular.  The egg rolls were very hot and crispy, giving them a wonderful taste.  Sweet and sour sauce was provided.  The potstickers, six nice ones, were the best we have tasted.  

Orders were very generous portions and we both brought home plenty of leftovers.

About $30.00 total, and very well worth every penny.

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"On my first visit to China Hot Wok I was hooked. I ordered the Hong Kong crispy noodles.  The portion was large enough for 2 meals and it came with yummy egg drop soup and a crab ragoon.  I was so impressed by the staff and food, I took my husband to lunch there the very next day."}
{"text":"The only thing good was the delivery guy was nice and it was early. The chicken was gummy and I asked for no shellfish in my Hot & Sour Soup, just regular fish. I got almost nothing but tofu and a SHELL!!! THERE WAS NO FISH AT ALL!"}
{"text":"We love Chinese food . 
Chicken wraps  are the best ever,  veggie chow main is so good non greasy at all.  Wontons  Are Yummy  .
Can't get enough food is always perfect . Great service . I don't have to ask for sauce or anything else 
Because they will make sure you get it . 
Best place for Chinese food #1 for us in whole vegas"}
{"text":"Second time ordering and it's just as good as the first. Delivery was super fast and the driver is always very polite. Glad I found this place!!!"}
{"text":"I spoke to a lady on the phone who was very courteous and patient with the fact that we had a hard time understanding each other. I placed my order online. Beyond Menu (the ordering app) was easy to use and lets you tip right on the app. The food arrived fast and hot and in generous portions. I had Mongolian Beef and Orange Chicken. As for the flavor, I kind of wish it was a little more intense, maybe it's my ethnic expectations. I am from California and I miss Chinese food there. Overall, as Chinese food places in Las Vegas go, I like it so far. I would order there again."}
{"text":"I just tried this restaurant for the first time today and I am so impressed! I live just a few minutes away, and by the time I drove over my pickup order was ready. I got the sweet and sour chicken. We all know that it can get soggy fast, but the sauce was served in a separate container from the chicken leaving it nice and crispy. The breading on the chicken was delicious, as was the sauce. I will definitely go back the next time I'm craving Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've ever had, soup was cold, I had garlic chicken spicy, it had no seasoning and was not spicy, The the chicken was chewy and overcooked, ask the waitress if I could have all noodles and no rice, she told me no, the Hot Wok is trying to be a China A Go Go,, never had anything bad at China A Go Go, my wife and I will never go back to Hot Wok, I didn't eat half of my food, it was so bad I refused to leave the waitress a tip"}
{"text":"I was craving sizzling rice soup and this was the closest place that came up when I typed that in to google maps.  Entering is a little awkward, wasn't sure if it was full service, or order and sit-style...I ordered and sat and served myself soda.  Sizzling Rice Soup flavor profile was right on, one of the best I've had.  Rice didn't sizzle though, but that is really just for show.  I had the lunch special Mongolian Beef...I forgot to say not spicy...it definitely had a kick.  Good flavor on that though too.  I would go back if I was in the area or if I was craving the soup again!  soup, lunch special Mongolian Beef and soda came to $15."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The people who work there are always so nice and give good service. The food is good and the portions are more than enough. I always have leftovers. This is my go to take out place."}
{"text":"I called for delivery on Sunday October 11 at around 8:00 pm and ordered orange chicken , general tsao's chicken . Boneless beef ribs and shrimp . Was told it could take 45 minutes , but it arrived steaming hot within 25 minutes ! Great delivery and when we dine in the food is always hot and delicious ."}
{"text":"Every time I drive up from California I always make a stop here. Amazing Chinese food and customer service. You can't go wrong with whatever you choose to order because everything is so good here. I personally always get the Thai tea with boba and sesame chicken. They are my favorite:) You guys should seriously place one in Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"So delicious, I've been here twice now and I have to say I don't think you can order anything bad here! I will definitely be back! Try the combination fried rice and Sweet and sour shrimp, to die for!"}
{"text":"I really don't see why this place gets so many stars.  Mediocre hole in the wall joint.  Not horrible but I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time tonight... with trepidation, based on the scary meals we've had at other Chinese restaurants here in the northwest valley. Surprisingly, pretty good!

First, the reasons for not giving 5 stars:

The potsticker dough was too thick, made them chewy and a bit unpleasant. Also, everything was served on Styrofoam plates with a plastic fork and spoon each. As the potstickers were large, I had to cut them up using the edge of a plastic spoon. Finally, while the complimentary eggrolls were nice, no spicy mustard was served.

Now for the good, and there was a lot.... huge servings per entree, each was enough to feed two hungry people alone. They were made fresh, and the sauces were good & flavorful. Also, when they say spicy, it IS! 

We ordered Szechuan (Hot garlic) Pork and General Tso's Chicken (Hubby's favorite). Both were good and we're definitely eating there again. Though, based on the plasticware, we might go for delivery or carry-out next time. Dinner was under $30 with tons of leftovers, and I noted that they deliver within six miles for $2.00.

UPDATE:

We got take-out when we had company last weekend and it was horrible. They said it would be ready in 10 minutes, luckily we got there early as it was already done. Got it home (VERY short drive and in the desert heat) and the food was all cold.

Crab Rangoons.. very little filling, absolutely zero flavor
Beef Broccoli - okay, needed more sauce, nothing special
Pork with String Beans - same as the Beef
Orange Chicken - I don't know what that chicken did to piss them off but apparently it was nasty. They pounded chicken to thin oblivion and breaded/fried it, served it with sickly sweet orange sauce on the side. It was chewy and tasteless without the sauce; sweet, chewy and boring with the sauce. Definitely the most hated entree of the night.

All four of us tasted everything then tossed it all out. Sad follow-up to what had been a great intro!"}
{"text":"We have been searching for good Chinese food in Centennial Hills since we moved from Dallas 6 years ago. Tonight we tried China Hot Wok for the first time. My takeout order was ready when I arrived and packaged very well. I got orange beef which was cut into smaller pieces so a knife wasn't required. Crispy on the outside and very tender on the inside. Good. My husband got Mongolian beef. I asked him how it was but he could only nod affirmative as he was shoveling it in!  Potions are large. Hot and sour soup was 5 stars. I am already looking forward to the next time we order."}
{"text":"Great Chinese take out. I've tried multiple places around Vegas and this at the top of the list. Everything super flavorful and their potstickers are amazing. Super thick and well seasoned. Will definitely be ordering from again."}
{"text":"Great food. Speedy service. Very friendly. I highly recommend this place. It is worth every penny."}
{"text":"This place is great! You get a large amount of food for a decent price. They even offer discounts if you pay by cash. The service was great and they are extremely friendly! Did I mention they deliver too!"}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up on eat24.  Site was easy to order and ready in about 15 min.   I got the individual dinner, option of entree, soup, side 1 and side 2 for $11.  Husband got Singapore noodles.   The food was really good and the best part is that there's NO MSG!   Yay for good Chinese food at reasonable prices and huge portions!  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Yum! Best local Chinese food in the NW valley. Great prices too the individual meal FTW!"}
{"text":"After a long day at work no one really wants to slave away at home over a hot stove.  I don't care if it's for an hour or twenty minutes.  Having just completed some errands in the area, it was confirmed with the GF, neither of us wanted to cook or clean anything.  It was decided between the both of us, Asian would be the meal of the evening.

I grabbed the smartphone and fired up the all knowing yelp app to see what my options were.  A quick reading of several reviews and I was sold on China Hot Wok.

A quick drive down Tenaya to Craig and CHW was located with ease.  I walked in and took notice of the semi-small dining area, but the cooking and prep area seemed larger and was teaming with activity.  

I stared at the menu on the wall and was unable to comprehend the menu...because everything looked delicious, I could not decide on what to order.

I grabbed a menu and started reading that.  I spied the weekly menu and saw they were doing sesame balls.  That would be the first thing I would order. 

I decided to give the Individual Dinner a shot.  A non-seafood item is going to run you $10.98.  This includes fried or steamed rice or chow mien, 2 egg rolls or 2 crab rangoon, egg drop or hot and hot sour soup, or wonton soup.  I picked the General Tso Chicken.

I ordered up for the GF, the Chef Signature Honey Walnut Chicken (12.98).  It came with a heaping serving of rice.  More on this meal to come...

The nice lady behind the counter was all smiles and friendly.  She was smiling even when she was taking orders over the telephone.

They were busy but my dinner-to-go, was out in quick fashion.

The particular type of food does not travel well.  By the time I made it home and the GF and I started eating, I did really take to General Chicken.  That being said, the Honey Walnut Chicken was awesome!  It serving size was enormous and puts all the other corporate Asian cuisine restaurants to shame.

The rice was good and the serving size of wonton soup was enormous and tasty.  

Heck yay, I am a fan.  I will happily stop by again when the family does not want to cook or do dishes."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite spots. Each day they have tons of different specials going on. Lunch special is until 4 pm each day and you get rice, noodles, egg rolls, and entree for $8. My favorite has been the mongoian beef and it comes with veggies I actually eat like onions and bell peppers complimenting the dish nicely. If you like your dishes extra spicy then just ask when ordering and they will hook it up. The pot stickers are really good and 6 come in the order at just under a buck each. I have ordered the pot stickers a few times now and it's been consistent and delicious. My wife really likes the fried won tons and the couple that I tried were pretty good. The noodles can be made with or without veggies, an option I like and the ones without veggies I had was pretty darn good. If you have room for dessert give the Chinese Donuts a try. The donuts come with sugar on them (ask for light or none if desired) and had a lightly crispy outside and softer inside and they were good. Nice hole in the wall Chinese place and the lady working behind the counter is very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good Chinese restaurant for a while.  We finally hit the jackpot. Food was delicious. The service was fantastic... Served with a smile... Huge portions though, we have leftovers... :) highly recommend."}
{"text":"They have the BEST egg rolls EVER but u MUST Request sweet & sour sauce or u won't get enough. Quick delivery. Food is always piping hot when it arrives! War won ton soup, salt & pepper chicken is always on point. The salt & pepper pork chops could have less bones & a lot less fat pieces but portion size is Huge & the flavor is oh so GOOD!!!  Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery, the food came earlier than anticipated which was great! I got the individual meals, beef hunan and also ordered the orange chicken one too. 

Both were delicious and had enough for left overs! The noodles were soft and incredibly flavored. 

Now not everything is perfect hence the 4 stars, the soup spilled while being delivered to us which made a mess in the kitchen which also made me not be able to try it. Next time I would ask them to wipe the sides and make sure the lid is secure on the top. I will order again!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoy the food here very much. It's quick, hot and delicious. The only thing I wish it had is the ambiance of a traditional Chinese restaurant. Please add Almond Chicken to your menu."}
{"text":"Went in tonite 3/25/17 to pick up an order of General Tso's and Singapore Noodles.  
Found a young man behind the front counter.  I told him that the Moo Shu Pork we ordered last week tasted like the pork had gone bad.  He laughed.  I then asked him if they had hired a new cook.  He counted out my change and turned from the counter.

My wife and I frequently order from this place when we feel like Chinese and their food quality is usually quite good.  I do not expect to be laughed at when I have a complaint about the food, I expect to be treated with courtesy and respect as I would have treated my customer if I was behind the counter.

I hope the owners read this yelp and make this right.

Brad M."}
{"text":"Great local spot when you're in the mood for Chinese fast-food and don't feel like cooking. I usually order To-Go or have them Deliver (only $2).

My favorites are the lettuce wraps and general tso's chicken. They give generous portions and always make sure your order is correct. Great lunch specials too."}
{"text":"I came prepared to be my usual snobby self about Chinese American food, but everything was very tasty!  Sizzling rice soup was truly sizzling hot, nice flavor, definitely settled my tummy and got me ready for more. BF wanted to try the New York style chow mein with tender chicken breast and crunchy veggies, with fried noodles on the side. Not at all your typical SFO or Hawaii chow mein, but still enjoyable on its own merits. To top it off, we added the shrimp egg foo young, with steaming gravy on top.  Surprisingly, all very nice. I learned to try a different style of Chinese food without preconceived notions and ended up thoroughly enjoying it all.  Service was sweet and friendly, everything fresh and prompt!  Of course, it's past the dinner hour at 8pm, but I think they will still hustle no matter what time you arrive."}
{"text":"After a long day of travelling, we stopped by China hot wok to grab some food.
Their BBQ sliced pork and salt and pepper chicken wings were AMAZING. Shrimp Chowmein and fried rice reminded me of the Cantonese food that I enjoy in my favorite DC hidden gem. It did not disappoint."}
{"text":"China Hot Wok is the place to go!! When my mom and I want food but we don't know specifically what we're craving, our go to spot is China Hot Wok. The employees are always sweet and accommodating. And the food is out of this world. It's a great local spot for anyone who wants ANAZING Chinese food. We've used their delivery and it was punctual. I couldn't believe how fast our food arrived. Eveything about this resturant is splendid. I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner. Was greeted immediately by Sherry. Her smile was genuine. We ordered egg rolls, shrimp with lobster sauce  and chicken with garlic sauce. Finally New York Style Chinese food! The food was outstanding. Large portions, hot, seasoned well. Loved hearing her family's story. Will definitely be going back. And did I mention that the restaurant was spotless???Would like to give more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Didn't feel like cooking after grocery shopping at albertsons.... Went in placed a to go order. Received food very quickly!!! Sesame Chicken, Fried Rice, Spring Rolls and Crab Ragoons-I approve it all!!!! Vey good!!"}
{"text":"Always always always order from here.Its always fresh and the service is great. For the price you pay you can feed a lot of people with plently left over for the next day.There always coupons available and you always get something free when you spend a certain amount.Now I'm hungry.."}
{"text":"They have not been inspected and The health department does not have them on their list of active restaraunts.

TAPEWORMS IN THE CHICKEN!!!#!"}
{"text":"Our family moved from Los Angeles, near Koreatown, to Las Vegas about one year ago.  Since then, we have been searching for a good Chinese restaurant.  I consider myself a foodie, and I have no problem driving anywhere for truly delicious food, regardless of the type of cuisine.  As far as Chinese cuisine is concerned, in Los Angeles, we drove to Chinatown to go to Yang Chow, or to Shanghai Grill near Beverly Hills.

Since we discovered it, China Hot Wok is now our go to spot for good Chinese food.  There are not that many tables for dining in, however the restaurant is clean, and the staff is very friendly and courteous.  Nina is super nice.

What we really appreciate is that they will make  any dish that you want, even if it is not on the menu.  They will also add or exclude whichever ingredient or vegetable, or make it more mild or as spicy as you would like.  We like their hot and sour soup made with pork, rather than seafood.  I like to put in some hot chili oil to make it more spicy.  Also, if you find a dish a little too sweet, you can ask them not to add any sugar, or as little oil as possible, etc... 

Also, they have squid, which most Chinese restaurants do not have, even some of the upscale restaurants.  I love Kung Pao squid, extra spicy!!  China Hot Wok also has big portions.  Two people can share one of their lunch specials, which are very reasonably priced, or you can have lunch and have enough left over for dinner.  China Hot Wok is a gem!!"}
{"text":"We order here about once every 2-3 weeks! The food is great! The customer service is awesome! I'm so glad they are so close to us... thanks China hot wok"}
{"text":"Been ordering to this place, they know me already, even i don't remember to ask them to be easy on sodium they know already what i want!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Seafood Delight by delivery, it wasn't bad. Standard fare for a Chinese take-out restaurant that caters to a Western audience."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to eat. We found this Chinese cuisine place and we fell in love with it! Their food is fantastic and satisfying. Everyone was so friendly and had the patience even though it was a little hard to understand them. Their lay out isn't anything fancy but it's rather comfortable, pleasing, and laid back. I definitely suggest this place!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service, surprisingly tasteful interior,  and decent Chinese food! And no MSG! (The owner had stated to me she is allergic to MSG and doesn't understand why other Chinese restaurants use it so much. )

I've been waiting forever for this place to open as it is close to my home. Every time I walked past the restaurant I saw more and more pieces of furniture going in.  Finally,  the lit up Boba and open sign appeared! Yay! 

The owner Sharry is a bubbly and sweet girl who warmly greeted me and asked me what my preferences were in terms of spicy and overall flavor. One thing that I liked was the fact that they had an open kitchen so you could see all of the preparation.

I opted to get one of the \"individual dinners. \"

The sweet and sour soup was my starter: smooth and not spicy, chunky with ingredients. 

Next was crab Rangoon. Perfectly fried,  just wish there was a tiny bit more crab. 

Spring roll was delicious.  Best thing of the menu.  Lightly fried,  tons of seasoned, crispy shredded veggies inside. 

The curry chicken was well prepared but since I asked for spicy, it was a surprise to taste how mild it was. 

My main compliment for the restaurant is how well everything is fried - no trace of greasy.

My portion size for individual was huge.  I took most of it to go! 

Good for a quick local fix of American Chinese food, overall."}
{"text":"It's solid delivery chinese food, which i understand the chinese just call \"food\".

I can't rate going there, i had it delivered and it was pretty fast.  I felt the vegetable rolls were a great deal.  Look man it wasn't great, it sure wasn't bad, it was THREE STARS."}
{"text":"Really nice people working here always with a smile and very friendly love coming back here"}
{"text":"This place was good not excellent but if you're searching for good and a lot of food for cheap I'd go here. 
I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"We were looking for some good Chinese food in the area. Liked the reviews so decided to give it a try.  Very happy we did.  I ordered the individual combination with General Taos Chicken.  Our was excellent, very spicy and a large portion. My girlfriend had the individual combo also but with Bourbon Chicken. She said it was really good too. Also we ordered an appetizer of sliced bbq pork that was the best I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"TLDR: ASK FOR MORE SAUCE! SUPER RUDE CASHIER! OK, BUT NOT STELLAR FOOD. 
This is going to be ridiculous because no one should have to write reviews on bad service, but know that the food is a little blander than other Chinese food places, but overall not terrible. So we order Family dinner b with sweet-and-sour chicken and mixed kung poa. Comes with hot and sour soup, 2 egg rolls (more like a thicker spring roll), two fried shrimp and 2 crab rangoon. The latter 3 need sweet and sour sauce as well as our sweet-and-sour chicken. We only had one sweet and sour sauce, which by pics you can tell is less than 8oz. Hell with even just one 8oz. you'd still be left with desert dry chicken choking all the moisture from your body. We called and asked what's the deal and she had the stones to say ppl like it that way. Bitch wtf!?!@ Do people like calloused dry handjobs where you come from?! No way in hell is that enough sauce for sweet-and-sour chicken and two fried shrimp and two crab Rangoon and two eggrolls. 

I came back the next day since she promised she would give me the sauce the next day because we would have it for lunch. She looked at me like I was some alien when I asked for the sauce (it's not too far and I had to be at Albertsons). She still insisted that some people think that it is too much sauce. [[Bitchwtf.exe]] She needed to drop the bitch ass attitude. I really only write when wronged. Here, even if I'm some super crazy customer, don't be prideful. She can fuck right the fuck off"}
{"text":"Delivery is smooth. Ordering is smooth. The food is hot and delicious. Fresh and exactly what we like! And the egg rolls are a ten star."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a 1:00 pm Sunday meal. A friendly waitress smiled and greeted us as we walked in and we grabbed a booth as it was not busy. 

There is a large selection on the menu from which to choose. We decided upon the family dinner where we can select two entrees. It comes with a choice of soup, two egg rolls, and two crab Rangoon. We had egg drop soup, beef and broccoli, cashew chicken, and BBQ pork fried rice. We were blown away by the amount of food that was presented on our table. We wound up leaving with plenty of food to take home.

Now, the place is not a fancy restaurant. However, if you would like a good meal, you can get it here. It also serves as a good place to pick up carry out meals. Plus, it is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The customer service at China Hot Wok, located at: 7121 W Craig Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89129, really lacks....., well, customer service. 
We used to enjoy the restaurant based mainly on its convenient location. The food has always been good in my husband's opinion, and alright in mine and the kids. The price is in line with other Asian restaurants that have better tasting food, but as I said the location was really what helped this restaurant. Especially due to a sudden lack of transportation. 
On the plus side the food does consistently remain alright. 
We had not visited in a while, but did order from them twice within the last three weeks. The first time we waited just over an hour and 45 minutes for a delivery order. I called at the point of just about an hour wait and was told that it was on it's way. I called again at that hour and 45 minute mark to be asked to confirm the address, which they did have correct, but I was told the order was back in the restaurant. Completely frustrated, and now had a famished family I stated to never mind the delivery that I would come pick it up. There was no real apology or empathy shown. The food was alright in the end of it all. My husband's order was better, and something we hadn't ordered in the past. 
About a week later we place a pick up order & ordered the Ginger Beef again as we did like my husband's. Only this time it was not nearly as good and didn't taste like Ginger at all. It didn't really taste like anything other than plain beef. I called to confirm what we had ordered, let them know it wasn't flavored at all and that we still had the full order. They made no apology, or effort. All that I was told was to ask for extra Ginger on our next order. She completely missed the fact that we had a $40.00 order of Ginger Beef in front of us that missed the mark entirely. Claerly the ginger had been forgotten during preparation. She seemed to be relying on the communication gap, and the order being lost in translation. I was repeatedly asked to just order it with extra ginger next time. 
The fact of the matter is, I simply won't place another order. There won't be a next time. It has been about a week since the incident, but because I am still a bit heated over it all and with a recent request from Google to share our experience, I figured I may as well. 
I don't recommend this particular China Hot Wok based mainly on our last two visits. Although I frankly don't care for it much in general anyway."}
{"text":"So so good!!! Our family always orders from here. It's not too greasy!!! No complaints"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here. I had the Hunan Beef and was not disappointed. It's consistently good and flavorful. I also had the General Tzo chicken and sesame chicken whicj are equally as good. It's a family run restaurant and that gives them an edge to really care about their food.

Service is good and attentive. The restaurant is clean too which is nice."}
{"text":"first time there and the last......noodles were so soft you could throw than at the wall and they would stick!!!! soup was like dish water......pass this place by......."}
{"text":"So tried this place for the first time the other night after it didn't work out at another place.

I felt like an idiot because I couldn't open the door. Lol ! It's very heavy! So no they aren't closed, so if it's windy one day just try harder than I did lol.

The girl working there was very helpful and explained my options after I explained what I was looking for and what I liked in the menu. 

Food was pretty good. The fried rice was a little dry/ could have used a little more flavor  but still good , only reason I didn't give 5 stars.

I will definitely be coming here again. They were super nice and the food was good. Service was very fast."}
{"text":"The food delivery was quick and the food was very fresh. A good choice when feeling lazy in Vegas and a Chinese food craving hits.

Winners: Honey Walnut Prawns, Pot Stickers, Wonton Soup, General Tso's Chicken, Combination Chow Mein,"}
{"text":"Very good food, very reasonable prices.  Service was quick and courteous.  You can't really top this place if you have a craving for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Orange chicken was decent. Ordered veggie fried rice with no mushrooms. There were very little veggies, And there were mushrooms. Delivery took over one hour."}
{"text":"Low prices, low quality, and high Yelp ratings, but the wok just isn't hot enough. My daughter and husband enjoy Chinese takeout, so I had hoped that China Hot Wok would be a tasty upgrade from their usual Panda Express. I placed a simple order of rice and noodles to test them out.

The chow mein noodles were soft, probably 10 minutes past al dente, lacking any chew or char to impart flavor. These noodles and the fried rice were no better than the offerings of a cheap Chinese buffet. You could prepare this food in a microwave. By comparison, you would think that my neighborhood Panda Express employs professional wok chefs."}
{"text":"$8 lunch combo ordered the Burbon Chicken was so delicious not all syrup covered like I was worried about.  Customer service was excellent and place was clean: has an A health code rating posted.  My mom ordered sweet and sour pork, she was delighted that the sauce came on the side. overall nice relaxing american Chinese food restaurant"}
{"text":"Amazing! So delicious, reasonable, very fast and you can see the kitchen (I like that because you can see the food being made). The people working are always so kind and nice and if you're a regular they throw in extras if you tip. Love this place!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a Chinese place nearby that offered take out. We found China Hot Wok on Yelp and based on the reviews decided to give it a try. We placed our order online and paid for it. Then headed over to pick our order up. We had ordered Wor Wonton Soup, String Bean Beef, Vegetable Chow Mein, Crab Rangoon, 2 orders of Sweet Sour Chicken and 2 orders of Chicken Fried Rice (one was suppose to be free as part of a special). The order did come with 3 things of plain rice as well. They were packaging up our food right as we arrived. The lady who helped us was very friendly and said to call in our order next time and they would give us a discount. We took our food and left. We realized when we got home that they only gave us one thing of fried rice (we didn't get the free order of fried rice). The food was ok. Felt the Sweet Sour Chicken could have used more pineapple chunks (only found a few in each order). Same with the Chicken Fried Rice. Only found a few pieces of small chicken. Everything else was ok. Not sure we'll be back though considering we paid $57 for everything. Bit pricey for just ok food."}
{"text":"China Hot Wok is located in a busy shopping center. My first visit ever was last week when I was in the area running errands nearby. I used my Yelp app to find a place close by to grab dinner and found this tasty place.

China Hot Wok is a step above your usual Chinese take out spot. It actually has a decent amount of seating for those wanting to dine in. The cashier will take your order if you are just picking up to go, or in our case she came to our table to take our order. She was friendly, refilled our drinks, and even offered us a free order of pot stickers! I was a fan just from that simple gesture. How nice is that? 

We ordered the general tso chicken, hunan beer, combination (beef and shrimp) noodles, and salt and pepper pork. Steamed white rice was included with our order and they were definitely not stingy about the portion. She even offered to bring us more rice if we wanted. The pot stickers were homemade and even though they were a little bit different than I expected, I still liked them! My favorite dish was the hunan beef. The food was great for the price! Four dishes, a mountain of rice, two drinks and free pot stickers put our bill around $45. Not too shabby considering I now had leftover that I could take to work for lunch the next day (and then some!). 

I would definitely come back if I ever found myself hungry on this side of town. The ingredients were fresh and everything we ordered was on point. Not too forget the huge portions-- perfect for family gatherings and such. 

Pro Tip: bring cash! I saw on the specials board that there was a deal for a free half entree for those who are paying with cash. Not sure if it's an on going offer, but I thought that was pretty cool deal."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place. New York style. Always hot and fresh. The Pad Thai and sesame chicken is my favorite. I love their pot stickers too."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to China Hot Wok for some quick takeout. The prices are ridiculously cheap. I'm not sure how they plan to make a profit unless they are going to be very very busy. At any rate I ordered hot sour soup and sizzling rice soup. Both were very good, hearty and taste very much like the ones I was used to from San Francisco. Next, Chinese chicken salad which, is one of those items that is been made popular in American Chinese restaurants. This was basically some mixed field greens, sliced fried chicken breast, some crispy wonton skin and assorted salad vegetables. The salad dressing is light and actually quite good. It's nothing like the cheesecake factory version however I would order this item here again. The orange chicken was decent, Albeit made with a little too much cornstarch to thicken the sauce. The flavor was surprisingly good. The last and weakest item I ordered was chicken Pad Thai. Being that it is a Chinese restaurant, my expectations for this dish were quite low. Call it a test. My expectations were aptly met. I would delete this item from the menu all together and focus on what you do best which is Chinese.
I'll be back as it is close to where I live and the only decent Chinese food I found in a 5 mile radius."}
{"text":"Writing on mobile but want to get it all out there:

-Food is SUPER tasty. Tons of flavor, cooked just right, right temperature even with delivery. 

-Portions are generous. Sesame shrimp dish (delicious by the way) had at least 10-15 pieces of shrimp in it. The kids meal portion size was also generous-- would have satisfied me for lunch and I'm a 28 year old woman. My kid ate about half.

-Paper wrap chicken is super good. I had no idea what it was but ordered it anyway. It seems to me to be ground chicken steamed in little foil packets....? Not totally sure but it was spot on and didn't need any dipping sauce or anything. 

-Delivery was estimated at 40-60 min at about 5:30 on a Saturday night. Actual delivery time about 20-25 min and the driver was very polite. 

Overall, definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this wonderful new restaurant. Extremely friendly and efficient service. Food is delivered hot and quickly to your table.  I have tried the curry chicken, combination kung pao, sesame chicken, orange chicken and hot and sour soup. Everything has been excellent!"}
{"text":"Typical strip mall Chinese food. Well balanced flavors, & a very courteous staff will treat you right. Quick service. You can usually pick up your call in order in 10 minutes, or have it delivered within 30 minutes. Nothing they make is bad, but it's not outstanding either. They don't do Thai food well, but the Chinese standards are good. I've had them make me special orders off menu before, & they were very accommodating. They always give me free spring rolls too."}
{"text":"I order for delivery and didn't wait that long but the food was great. Bbq spare ribs the best, fried rice was really good and the chow fun noodle loved it. Will order again."}
{"text":"On this visit the food was hot and fast as usual but the service was not up to their usual standards. You'll notice the lady on day shift goes out of her way to give great service. The swing shift lady was a touch surly and aloof. Or maybe I'm just used to getting spoiled by the super-friendly day shift."}
{"text":"I ordered the Kung Pao Lunch Combo for delivery. Not only could the delivery guy not break a $20 bill (Order was $10.63)  But it did not come with a drink or the crab rangoons that the LUNCH COMBO is supposed to come with.

Edit - After the 3rd time of coming back to my house, the order is now complete. I didn't make a fuss about it, they just kept coming back to make it right."}
{"text":"HUGE PORTIONS! 
Excellent value for the price. 
Fast, friendly and cheap delivery at only $2.
The curry chicken meal combo with fried rice, 2 egg rolls, Soup and fortune cookie is very tasty and only $11! Great price! 
If you buy the full size meal (I bought orange chicken) it is a PACKED container. Choose to add a side of fried rice for $2.50 and that is another PACKED box. 
The pot stickers were a little thick and doughy but still good. 
This will be my go to Chinese when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My first order here and everything was gooooood!! We ordered the war won ton, chow mein combo, and the orange chicken.  

Delivery was fast and the food was still hot. We will be ordering again."}
{"text":"We loved everything we got here. Chicken lettuce wraps, veggie spring rolls, pot stickers, hot garlic chicken & sesame chicken. Even the Thai tea was delicious. My boyfriend and I disagreed on the pot stickers, he said there's room for improvement, while I actually really enjoyed them. The dough was thicker than I'm used to and I didn't mind it at all! Plus the service was great. Seriously the nicest kid served us. All smiles and he made some wonderful recommendations. I think it's worth a try for anyone wanting good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Ordered for Delivery and was told 45 min but came Hot Fresh and in less than 30 mins. They have the Best Pork Foo Young ever, and Sesame Chicken!! I deff will be calling for Delivery next time. I'm pleased with this Restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place used to be very good. waited for delivery for an hour and 22 minutes finally had to cancel either change of ownership or management but no apology"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place received an average of 4 stars.  Food was delivered hot and fast but first, off it was not even what we ordered.  Don't have \"curry chicken\" on the menu then serve chicken and vegetables with a \"curry flavor\" which was also very watered down.  The BBQ pork chop suey also very bland.  The crab rangoon was okay, not hard to mess up.  Maybe it was an off night for them but I would not order again.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"It's pretty hard to find a Chinese restaurant that's decent enough to just grab and go. This place is perfect for that. The food is pretty good and I like that the cooks wear hats! They give pretty good portions too."}
{"text":"5 Stars! You feel like you're walking into a families kitchen and they treat you like it. But most importantly the food is phenomenal. If you're looking for a warm environment and great food for a good price. China Hot Wok is your place."}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying that my order was delivered 20 minutes earlier than expected! We ordered 2 orange chickens, a general tso chicken, crab Rangoon, and 2 sodas. Everything was still hot and the crab rangoon was actually still crispy! The lunch portion was enough to fill my husband up, my teen boy couldn't even finish all of his, and my dinner portion will be enough for AT LEAST 2 meals of leftovers! Very happy (and full) and will be ordering again."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much but the food is oh so delicious!

I had the eggplant tofu with steamed rice. I asked for little tofu and added broccoli and that's exactly what I got. 

My husband got this curried noodle dish with two different types or pork, chicken, and shrimp. He asked for the thick noodles which was also not a problem. 

I really mean it when I say that these two dishes were very flavorful and filling. My portion was so big I took home half of it and it was still a full meal. The prices are great, too. 

In the menu they say they do not add any msg which is nice. 

I really recommend this restaurant and I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars! Fast delivery and easy ordering using the Yelp app. My estimated delivery was 45 minutes and actual \"to door\" time around 35-40 min. The Individual Dinner for 1 has a great portion for an even better price. Spring roll, entree and soup. I would definitely say this is one of the better Chinese deliveries out there. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars because it isn't overwhelmingly spectacular....it's just good for the price. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Chinese fast food places tend to be the same in terms of quality, so what makes or breaks them is service.
The staff that works here are amazing to be around with friendly smiles and wonderful service. Would eat here again!"}
{"text":"Best potstickers ever - the rest of the food was OK, but the potstickers stole the show! I have traveled over 10 minutes a few times to get me some of those potstickers! I tried the general chicken as well and it was ok, if you're nice they will hook you up on some egg rolls - which are pretty bomb!"}
{"text":"A star for the fast delivery and a star for the amount of food you get for such good prices. However, my husband and I were very disappointed with the quality of the food despite all the good reviews I've read.  I ordered sweet and sour pork with fried rice and my husband ordered a chicken dish with plain chowmein. Boy was that chowmein plain tasting alright and unfortunately so was the rest of our food. The only thing I enjoyed were the fried wonton strips."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood Chinese take out.  They are very friendly and the food is consistantly good.  The won ton soup is the most authentic I have ever tasted from a fast food place.  Wish they had spare ribs on the bone instead of the boneless ones."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service first off!  I can't begin to say how sweet the lady I talked on the phone to was.  We liked everything.  The mixed veggies, egg rolls and rice were so good."}
{"text":"$7 lunch special with soup. The food is really greasy tho and the chow mein came with the lunch special is really blend."}
{"text":"The Orange chicken was awful... I also asked for half fried rice and Chow Mein, only received Chow Mien. Forgot sweet & sour. Overall not good food at all.... I have eaten way better Chinese food in North LV & highly recommend staying away from this one."}
{"text":"They delivered to me in the quickest time anyone has ever delivered and the food is delicious, just as I expected. Every time I order, their the best out of all the options.. when your rolling down your yelp app for the best neighboring chinese food, click China Hot Wok every time.. guaranteed hard working people. - Sincerely, A loyal customer."}
{"text":"The delivery was on time and great. The food was good but nothing to rave about or that made it stand out."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!!! :)  

Portions were huge but the food was BOMB!!  The best Chinese spot that I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"This is my first order from these guys; I liked it so far. We got the lettuce wraps (I highly recommend them for the price).  The chicken chow fun was very good, as were the pot stickers. 
The Pad Thai was Chinese style with thick noodles, not my favorite. And the Sesame chicken was a little mushy, but good flavor. 
We ordered delivery, and it took almost an hour, but we're about 5 miles away. 
I'd try them again with other entrées, but I'll get the lettuce wraps again."}
{"text":"With all the Chinese places to choose from I've been disappointed at each I've tried since moving here - but tonight I finally found the one! Dare I say the best Chinese I've ever had? I am super happy after my pork chop suey, and where else do entrees come with fried rice, wontons/egg rolls, and choice of soup!?"}
{"text":"Extremely impressed with China Hot Wok. I ordered thru GrubHub, which is my second time ordering thru them but my first time ordering with China Hot Wok. After placing our order, the estimated delivery time was between 1:15 pm - 1:26 pm which gave China Hot Wok an hour and fifteen minutes. I was extremely impressed they arrived super early @ 12:28pm. 

The food smelled so good and it was pipping hot. 

We ordered combination fried rice, chicken chow mein and orange chicken. That order came with white rice. Which is perfect cause my wife like white rice more then fried rice. 

The combination fried rice had chicken , pork and shrimp. It was so good. The chicken was moist, the pork slightly crispy yet tender and the shrimp wasn't over cooked at all. Personally my favorite 

The chicken chow mein was delicious. Most of the time chow mein can be a bit greats but this wasn't. The onion was cut a bit to big for our liking but that pretty much was the only complaint on the whole order. 

And the best part was the orange chicken it came very hot. You can tell it was made fresh. It was crispy & The chicken pieces were big. All in all our whole meal was super good  I give it a five stars !"}
{"text":"Fast delivery, fresh Chinese! Absolutely love the fried rice. The orange chicken is also great. I have ordered the beef lo Mein twice now and it tastes great except not a fan of the beef used in it, both times it was a little gray-ish and very soft and chewy."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and when I paid in cash the delivery man just walked away before I could ask for change back. If I knew he was just going to take off I would've paid in smaller bills. And the hot garlic beef I ordered was very sweet and not spicy at all. The chow mein I got with my order was almost nothing but noodles except for like 5 pieces of veggies. I hope it's better next time."}
{"text":"It has taken me too long to write this review. My family and I have eaten here for the past 2 years. We first found it when I lived in the area but now that I'm further away I still take the 15 minute drive because it's that good. 
Consistency is a big plus! The food is always good, no matter what we order. Some of the things we've ordered: Kung Poa chicken, general tso's beef and chicken, cashew chicken, crab rangoon, wontons, egg drop soup, etc. Portions are big, enough for 2 meals.
Price is great. One of the reasons I don't mind driving 15 minutes is because I know the food is good for a great price. They have lunch specials and dinner specials (individual dinners). Only difference between the 2 is dinner comes with soup and lunch is cheaper, even with the soup.
Service has always been top notch. This place is bomb. Will continue to come here!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant. I was on a huge chicken fried rice kick for a while and I ordered from a bunch of Chinese places, and this one was the best. Plus the delivery was pretty quick and I live in Centennial hills. I ordered from other places that were closer and it took longer and their food wasn't that great, so China hot wok is my go-to! I usually pick up some food before class during the week! I love it here! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ordered pot stickers and orange chicken with Singapore noodles. First two were good. The noodles were tasty right up till I bit into a piece of metal. Yeah, not cool. If you order from here be careful. I'll pass on this place next time I have a craving."}
{"text":"Good carryout. We live in Sun City and there is no decent Chinese carryout anywhere near us. We were out and about one day and I found this place on Yelp.  Everyone is friendly and helpful. They will make food to your liking, I like BBQ pork in my hot and sour soup instead of seafood.  Chicken in hot garlic sauce is very good. Nicely flavored and good balance of meat and vegetables. It is worth the drive on nights I don't feel like cooking. The food is always ready when we get there."}
{"text":"Good food, ordered online. Food was ready when I arrived. Was hot and just as good as I anticipated"}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese and found this place....love their bbq pork fried rice....we ordered Family Meal A and it was a lot of food. They also gave us free donuts for dining in. The cashier/server is really nice, she showed good customer service. A place my family will come back to."}
{"text":"Needed a new Chinese delivery spot found this place on Yelp and it's pretty amazing there's Singapore noodles were super yummy delivery time was perfect this will be my new go-to delivery spot"}
{"text":"Definitely satisfied my craving for Chinese food. Got the combination fried rice, sesame chicken and pot stickers. Everything was good and the delivery was fast."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing!!!! Great Prices and the best Chinese food I've had in Vegas. They had awesome deals if you paid in cash, so keep that in mind if you go. Will be visiting again soon!!"}
{"text":"I ate here 3 times, tried different entrée... The food is superb. Finally a good Chinese Restaurant.  It is better than all the  China restaurants I've tried on spring mountain.  The service is always friendly. Going back for more. .."}
{"text":"This by far is now my favorite Chinese restaurant.  The honey walnut shrimp was excellent along with the crab Rangoon.  Dining in was a great experience.  I am a average tipper but the service friendliness and food was so good I tipped 30%. My wife had the shrimp with lobster sauce and said it was great.  The Thai tea was the best she's had.  I can't remember the servers name even though I asked twice but she was very nice and mgmt should be happy to have her.  What more can I say.. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"I stopped here to China Hot Wok for some lunch to-go and was pleased enough with the service and food to come back to place a to-go order for dinner the following week. They have tables/seating inside and the employees were nice and helpful with going over items on the menu and current specials going on. Even though they do have coupons on their website and menus, they are not necessary. One of the girls working told me that they have specials written on the board daily, but there are more offered depending on the amount that you spend and the coupons attached to the to-go menus are just to remind you to ask for your freebie and they are cool with making certain adjustments if there is something else you are wanting to try. This place was very busy with both people eating inside as well picking up orders. My order took about 15 minutes the first time and about 10 minutes the second time to be ready which did not bother me since I saw how busy it was and knew it was being made fresh. 

Fried Wonton ($4.98 for 12) - I didn't think these looked appetizing the first time however they were so tasty that I wanted to order them again on my next visit. They are filled with ground chicken and onions and I felt no shame about eating all 12 of these crispy, tasty gems.

Pot Sticker ($5.98 for 6) - Filled with chicken and green onions. I prefer pork, but these tasted good and it was a nice portion for the price. Hubby liked them much more. 

Vegetable Egg Rolls ($1.98 for 2) Hubby didn't like these however I'm sure it was because there was veggies inside of which he's not a fan. I personally loved them and really liked that they weren't greasy.

Chow Mein ($6.58) - I asked for noodles with no veggies and they had no problem with my request. The noodles were good and more than enough for 2 people. 

Hot Garlic Chicken ($8.98) - This dish has chicken, carrots, mushrooms, bell pepper and onions stir-fried in a spicy szechwan sauce. I really liked this a lot, but there was nothing spicy about it. It had great flavor and I'd totally order it again, I just didn't get any heat from the dish. I put some of it over the white rice that came with it and it was really tasty. 

Chinese Donuts ($3.98 for 10) - If you don't like sweet things this isn't for you. These fried donuts are covered in sugar. I couldn't sit there and eat a bunch at once, but they were actually good! The donut alone tasted like a cruller and I am sure they can make some without sugar or you could ask them to go light, so if you are a fan of crullers give these Chinese Donuts a try. 

Mongolian Beef Lunch Special Combo ($7.58) - The price and portion was very good. I was impressed with the amount of beef there was and it came with rice, noodles, 2 veggie egg rolls (you can choose egg rolls or crab rangoons) and a fountain drink. The Mongolian Beef is stir-fried with veggies in a spicy Mongolian sauce. The first time I had this with the lunch special it had a nice kick, but the next visit when I ordered a full portion ($9.28) it lacked the heat it had previously. The beef was still delicious and worth the money however I will make sure and request it extra spicy when ordering in the future.

China Hot Wok offers catering. Lunch specials are available daily until 4 pm."}
{"text":"I ordered the individual meal for delivery  and it was delicious. Eggdrop soup, egg roll, chow mein, moo shu pork and fried rice. Delivery was on time and the food was hot. My only complaint is that they didn't send crispy noodles for the soup. I know it doesn't sound like a big deal, but I don't enjoy the soup without the noodles. 
I will order from there again but I'll be sure to remind them to include the noodles lol."}
{"text":"Ordered on yelp, it was close to home and had descent reviews. Ended up being very delicious, fast and portions were very geneticist. Also very friendly. Will be coming back. Great place"}
{"text":"The food is good. They are very fast both in house and with delivery. It is a very safe fallback restaurant for if you don't feel like cooking and just want to order in. Always check the website because they are constantly giving you free stuff depending on how much money you spend."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with the food at this establishment considering the good reviews on Yelp.  I ordered the combination fried rice.  The portion was large but very greasy and tasteless.  The meats were of poor quality.  Some cubes were pure fat, others were chewy and inedible.  My friend that was with me was equally unimpressed with his plate."}
{"text":"so good and so fresh! I love chicken lettuce wrap and egg fun yung, sesame balls and milk tea!"}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food at a good price. My kids like the food, which is always a winner in my book. The price wasn't too much, so this is a place we will visit again."}
{"text":"First impression 1: online ordering convince 2: fast delivery 3: the coup de gra the food was hot and delicious. So yes I will be ordering again."}
{"text":"This really was a surprise to us. We were on day two of a three-day road trip. Tired and not excited about eating out. Ordered delivery. Very good food! Plenty of it too. We have lunch for tomorrow. Broccoli chicken was great, as was the shrimp in lobster sauce, plus egg rolls and pot stickers (they were the best). Would definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Food is always hot, good and made to order. Really very fast. Love the chicken lo Mein and my son loves the shrimp fried rice. Pot stickers are awesome."}
{"text":"Good food but when it's delivered half an hour late, cold, and when I called the owner didn't offer to pay for my dinner or even a discount... offered a free appetizer. ..wtfriedrice"}
{"text":"Great food!!!  They happily substituted tofu (yeah, don't judge me) in place of meat.  Gave me extra vegetable eggrolls which I might add were delicious!  We ordered basic fare - kung pao tofu and sweet and sour tofu.  Our meal was great, the portions were huge and the service fantastic.  The folks working there were so very nice and helpful.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Thought I'd add my two cents in after having had this place twice now. I feel like Chinese food can be so hit and miss around here but this place is fantastic! The egg rolls are the best I've had in a long while, they don't forget to include extra sweet and sour sauce when you ask, and the beef and broccoli was so tender! Not chewy and tough like I always seem to experience at other places! The egg drop soup is delicious but I'm always so full by the time I get my soup that I never eat much! 5 stars overall, haven't let me down yet!"}
{"text":"Great food and delivery.  We ordered the family meal- it was so much food. The sweet and sour soup is the right amount of spicy and tasty. That's a must order. The Mongolian beef was tasty but a lot of vegetables. We enjoyed the orange chicken and fried rice. Can't wait until next time."}
{"text":"First time to try it and I am very pleased! It's delicious! If you want to something little bit spicy you should order Singapore noodles!"}
{"text":"What a WASTE of 110.00, including the the 17.00 tip I gave them for being incredibly fast. WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON THEY GET TWO STARS!!! The meat was soooo slimy...& covered in an oily broth, the wonton soup was MUSH! The only decent part was the vegetables, except that I ordered them with no onions and they were FULL OF THEM. Not a fan, at all."}
{"text":"This place is fairly good when it comes to the food. As i got the Orange Chicken individual dinner which is great because it is a lot of food for one person. Also got an order of Beef and Broccoli as well as the Honey Walnut Shrimp. The only problem was that the Honey walnut shrimp was over 12 dollars and was sub par it tasted good till i tasted the shrimp which had no flavor whatsoever, but other than that it was pretty good."}
{"text":"The food is so good. It was here in under twenty minutes, the crab raging were to die for, and it's so worth the price. The wonton soup was the worst part but it was still good, it just didn't have enough non-liquid things in it. Like the Flickr was okay but it had like three wontons and the smallest amount of chives. Like I said though still pretty good. The wontons I will dream about tonight! Not too oily and just crunch enough. Yum. I got the orange chicken and fried rice which posted wonderfully. I was too full after a couple bites but it could feed me for days! It  was so much for the price and so tasty. I also ordered a two liter Diet Coke and it came all frosty and delicious. 10/10 would order again!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, very clean place, & the lady at the front desk was super nice...which is rare coz almost every Chinese place I go, they hardly smile. Well thank goodness now I know a good Chinese place by my mom's house :)"}
{"text":"Egg foo young is perfect and chicken wings are to die for! Called because I didn't feel like making dinner. Food got delivered about 25 mins. after I ordered online. Friendly driver which is hard to find when ordering food"}
{"text":"This place has become my go to Chinese take out place over the last few months. I usually get a hankering for soup and I pop on over for a pick up. This isn't super close to my place, but I'm willing to travel because so far I've had pleasant food and service experience. Everyone knows it's tough to find a decent Chinese place. This spot is definitely worth a try if you find yourself wanting some Americanized Chinese eats.

I only really order the chicken noodle soup and wonton soup, but I will branch out eventually. The chicken noodle soup is delicious, with lots of noodles, vegetables, tasty chicken, and a great light broth. They separate the noodles out which is nice. The wonton soup is also good, but I wish they would pack the broth and the wontons & veggies separately because the wontons tend to sort of deteriorate when left in the broth for an extended amount of time. No one likes gummy wontons. No one! Other than that, pretty gosh dang tasty. The wonton soup is the Wor kind so it has all the goodies. Chicken, veggies, BBQ pork, wontons, all in a yummy broth. I've eaten a lot of wonton soup in my day and this hits the spot. 

They pack you up some crispy wontons and sweet and sour sauce, which is a nice touch. On to go orders, they put in napkins and cutlery in your bag as well. Please separate the wontons from the broth and you will be five stars for me, China Hot Wok!

Pick up is easy and they always have my order ready. The ladies are always nice during our brief interaction. I will continue to frequent this place and try other dishes. Prices are fair for the amount of food you get. Get yo wok on!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new Chinese place to eat,  several other places had been somewhat disappointing.  We were pleasantly surprised by the food here. We got the $25 family dinner and it was delicious. It came with lots of choices. We got the xorn egg flower soup wich was fresh, hot, and good. We got 2 crab rangoons and two eggrolls, which were good and not greasy. We chose bbq pork fried rice which was decent. For our two entrees we got sesame chicken and chicken chow mein. The chow mein was really good - fresh, flavorful,  and full of chicken. The sesame chicken was amazing. I usually don't like this dish, it tends to be gooey and too sweet, but this one was light with a very nice sauce that had sesame,  scallions, and chili flakes. It was just felicious! I will dwfinitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have lived in Vegas for a year now finally find a Chinese food restaurant that I actually like !!good service and great food!!"}
{"text":"So I'm giving this place 4 stars.  The pros about this place was that the food was hot  & good.  We ordered orange chicken and chicken chow mien both delicious.  The portions are also very generous.  They delivered to my house, which is 4 miles away for only $2 delivery charge.  
The con was that the delivery took close to an hour n a half. It could have been busy at 7pm on Sunday. Kind of a long wait time for delivery.  Willing to try this place out again maybe when I'm not so hungry, so I can plan on the long wait."}
{"text":"Descent prices and good food. I would recommend this place for a fast take home meal. I always get the chicken fried rice. It's bomb! Another favorite is the sweet and sour chicken. It's good and Does not leave that greasy taste in your mouth. People are friendly and open pretty late. Good place to go if your craving Chinese food"}
{"text":"Went for their lunch special. The Kung Pao was good and a large portion. They do their lunch special a little weird; you get the main entree, noodles, rice and little cup of egg drop soup. Again, large portion and food was good. If you upgrade to the lunch combo you get egg rolls, cheese rangoons and drink.  I was a little disappointed that Hot & Sour soap didn't come with the lunch special. 

Went back last night for a call in, carry out order of dinner Kung Pao w/rice... it was great!  They still serve to go orders in the traditional Chinese food carry out boxes... that is HUGE important!

The lady that is the hostess/owner is super friendly, nice and helpful.  I want to try their Hot & Sour and they have Sesame Balls (YEAH!), I need an order of those!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, generous portions, fair prices and a clean restaurant. We will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"I came to China Hot Wok a few days after they opened.  I was looking for another Chinese place to add to my rotation.  The main thing I was looking for was that they have Chow Fun noodles.  They do indeed.  And they are good noodles too.  Not as oily as some Chow Fun I've had other places.  This had more bean sprouts than what I am used to receiving but that isn't a problem.  Thats just texture.  There was not shortage of noodles or meat which is the important thing.  I got a lot of food for a completely average price.  Service was great as well.  The lady at the register was very friendly and the food was ready quite fast.  I'll be back for sure.  I may get the same food wherever I go but it is nice to have the option of another place where the food may differ in taste."}
{"text":"The food was good and hot.The people are nice and very helpful. We had Orange chicken, mu shu, chow mein, teriyaki chicken, and Mongolian beef-spiced just right. The crab Rangoon was good and the veggie egg rolls were excellent. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food! It's one of the only places where the delivery food comes hot and steamy. Love it! Huge portions and a good price."}
{"text":"It was alright, the fried rice didn't have enough flavor, the Kung Pao chicken and Mongolian beef had more veggies than meat."}
{"text":"I LOVE their Chicken Fried Rice. Huge fan of anything else that I have gotten there. My favorite is the Orange Chicken. The staff there is extremely nice. I would really recommend this place."}
{"text":"Favorite place to satisfy my chinese food cravings! Super friendly staff.. Delivery is amazing! I love the food best chinese food on my side of town!!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review while I'm in the restaurant. I ordered the Hunan beef. Obviously cooked to order. Huge portion! The quality is 5 stars for sure. This may be my new go to spot for Chinese!"}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese food! I got the dinner for one and it honestly lasted for 3 meals. SO MUCH FOOD! I got the Moo Goo Gai Pan chicken with fried rice, wonton soup and crab ragoons as the dinner selection and butterfly shrimp just for kicks :) The food container was overflowing with chicken and rice and the restaurant threw in 2 egg rolls for free (so sweet!). Needles to say, there was just no way to finish all that food in one sitting... The flavors are great, food is fresh and delicious. This will be my go to restaurant when craving Chineese food, so glad they're 5 min from my house!"}
{"text":"This place is fast delivery and excellent food. I ordered the family dinner for $10. I had it delivered and they were prompt about it. The food was good. I ordered the orange chicken with the chow me in with the egg drop soup and crab Rangoon. Definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I had the potstickers which the inside was just a mush of who knows. Not very tasty. And there was so little of it. Most of it was the outside of the potsticker which was greasy and mushy. We also had pork fried rice. The rice was undercooked. Pork was over cooked to death. I had chow fun which was just a pile of greasy tasteless mush. The salt and pepper wings were just ok. I pretty much ate a little of everything and tossed it. Not pleased at all. The delivery guy was quick and nice though."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery last night and boy was it speedy and hot and fresh!! The guy was nice and the food was awesome! Egg rolls, general tso chicken and noodles. Everything was great and they did not miss anything. Utensils, soy sauce etc. Definitely will order again!!"}
{"text":"I've only been in Vegas for about 6 months and I have been struggling to find a good Chinese food place. I found this place from a mailer I received and I definitely think I have found my place!

I have been here several times and a big deal for me when it comes to Chinese food is consistency and this place rocks!  Their individual dinner is an awesome deal as it comes with an entree, rice or noddles, an a soup choice!  I almost always get their pot stickers and they are killer!  

Portion sizes are good and the girls that run the front counter are always real nice. 

I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Even though the delivery guy was a little late with my food I was happy to get it and eat! Food was warm and delicious and the lady that took my order was super nice and cute! I'm definitely ordering again!"}
{"text":"This is a Great Restaurant Establishment to Dine for Lunch or Dinner!! 
The Staff there are always Friendly with an Ever ready Smile!!

The Cuisine @ China Hot Wok is always Fresh to order & consistent.
The Menu has a Vast Variety & many options to order by!!

I have Dined @ China Hot Wok these past Couple of years now with Family and Friends & I can honestly say that I've have never left there hungry or disappointed.
In fact the portions that they serve you there are so large that I often take my left overs home for another full meal for later!!! Lol

Great job China Hot Wok Team!

{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight because of the Yelp reviews and it was great!!!
I especially loved the Kung Pow Chicken.....really great spice!
Other honorable mentions are the Shrimp with Lobster sauce and the Chicken with Black Pepper Sauce.
As the Yelp reviews have mentioned.... the portions are huge! You can opt for Fried Rice instead of White Rice with your Entree', I ordered two Entree's with White Rice and two with Fried Rice. I ended up with an enormous amount of fried rice!
Delivery was extremely fast and food was quality, will definitely order again."}
{"text":"First time trying this place...

It's clean, the service was really good, and the menu was typical. 

I ordered the chicken lo mein and combination fried rice. 

The food was full of flavor, and I'm glad I have a new option when I want Chinese. 

Check it out people."}
{"text":"Ordered through eat24.com! The restaurant I wanted to order from for delivery was already closed, so we decided to switch it up and I'm glad we did! The minimum to order is low and so is the delivery fee. 
   We ordered two of the \"individual dinners\". For the price you get a lot more for your buck instead of ordering the entrees separately. We ordered a General Tso's Chicken with hot and sour soup, fried rice and (2) crab rangoons, then a Sweet and Sour Chicken with wonton soup, steamed rice and (2) vegetable eggrolls. Then an order of Honey Walnut Shrimp. 
   The delivery was right on time and the food was delicious and fresh. I was taken aback by the General Tso's chicken because my first bite I bit into a pepper! Hahaha, but it was very good. The Honey Walnut Shrimp, eggrolls and rangoons were still crispy. Although the rangoons had barely little filling. We asked specifically for utensils (chopsticks, forks and hopefully spoons because we ordered soup) but received none. We'd order from here again."}
{"text":"food was okay chicken was not the color it was supposed to be so made me a little iffy prices are very good and inside is very clean. would only order here if nothing else was available though"}
{"text":"One star for the speedy delivery and nice delivery man. The food was awful, panda is even better! The chow mein was thicker than spaghetti and the general chicken was very dry and so was my wife's orange chicken. The egg drop soup had no flavor. Food is very bland. We were so disappointed after reading the great reviews!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in Vegas! They are extremely friendly and always smiling and happy to answer any questions you may have. The Mongolian beef is to die for. I also recommend trying the cream cheese Rangoon's."}
{"text":"I've only gotten the Singapore Noodles here, but I've gotten them on 3 occasions now. 

They're friendly. It's only taken a few minutes to get my order. And it's relatively consistent. 

The Singapore noodles have plenty of flavor, and a substantial amount of meat. In particular, I always seem to get a lot of shrimp, which is awesome, because they're well cooked and delicious. Nothing is greasy. And I always ask for it to be very spicy, and they do a reasonable job of giving it a little kick. 

The egg rolls are good, I usually don't like egg rolls but these are nice and crunchy and don't taste like old cabbage.  

The hot mustard is legit, just have to ask for it. Very hot, exactly how it should be. 

Definitely my go to for Chinese right now."}
{"text":"Best wonton soup!! I order from here often and they deliver fast. The person below who said they haven't been inspected is lying. I'm careful about where I eat so I found their inspection credentials (they have an A rating)"}
{"text":"The food here is very good, we ordered for delivery and it took over a hour and I had ordered two entrees one with fried rice the other with noodles and I received two fried rice. Then I noticed they changed it on the receipt to both with fried rice. When I contacted eat24 they never responded. Bad customer service and takes to long for delivery!"}
{"text":"So happy to have a great casual Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood! The staff here are super friendly, they go out of their way to make sure you are happy. This is a casual spot with about 10 tables but the do a brisk take out business and also deliver.
 I try to stay away from the fried foods but there is still plenty to enjoy on the menu. Love the Won Ton Soup and Moo Goo Gai Pan. They use the freshest ingredients and have big portions. An order is usually enough for 2 meals. Each order also comes with egg rolls, \"chips\" and a fortune cookie. Great little spot!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food always has great flavor. Wide selection of plates to suite the individual up to a group. Always on time or early with take our orders."}
{"text":"Odered delivery and recieved our food very quickly. It was still very hot and the food was very good. Will definitely be our go to for Chinese food."}
{"text":"I really like this Chinese restaurant compared to all the other ones I've been to in the past. Once we walked in we were greeted immediately with a smile on her face and sat us at a table immediately.

We came here during lunch hour and they offer a wide variety of dishes to choose from for under $10! While we were looking through our menu, they gave us a bowl of egg drop soup and fortune cookies. That made us really happy!

I ordered the honey walnut shrimp (not on lunch menu) and my other party ordered the Mongolian beef. We were amazed of how fast it came out and how beautiful and delicious it looked.

Overall I loved the excellent customer service, prices were great, and the food was delicious. Thank you so much and I really mean it and definitely will be coming here again"}
{"text":"Fourth time and still excellent.  We usually pick up but tonite we ordered for delivery 5pm on a Saturday evening.  It was delivered in 30 mins as promised - piping hot and delicious.

The young lady that answers the phone to take your order is polite and patient.  

We have enjoyed:
Wonton Soup - tasty broth and delicious ingredients
Hot and Sour Soup - nice balance
Orange Chicken - perfect amount of tangy sauce and crispy 
Shrimp with Lobster Sauce - has black beans and green pepper.
Honey Walnut Shrimp - scrumptious
Combination Fried Rice - wonderful

So nice to finally have a local Chinese Restaurant that is consistent in their preparations.

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place has huge portions for the price you pay, and the quality of the food is excellent. It's your typical American-style Chinese restaurant, but it's a good one.

The lady who normally works behind the counter is always friendly and helpful, even when they're really busy. If you order a large amount of food, you can get a free entree or appetizer, depending on how much you spent. Even with just two people, we normally get a free plate of Chinese doughnuts, egg rolls, or crab rangoons.

My favorite dish here is the Hong Kong Crispy Noodle (a.k.a. pan-fried noodles), but the Salt and Pepper Porkchops are great, as are the Walnut Shrimp and most everything else.

Again, the portions are pretty large, and each entree hovers around $10. I've ordered only one entree for myself and walked out with leftovers. If you're looking for some pretty good Chinese food for a reasonable price, I'd definitely recommend China Hot Wok."}
{"text":"Generous Portions

My date and I stopped by recently for a quick bite with zero expectations. Fortunately, our service was quick and the food was pretty decent. The portions are plentiful and the egg rolls are yummy. If your in the area I'd recommend stopping by you cant go wrong with fried rice!"}
{"text":"Great place and friendly staff...love the salt and pepper shrimp.. Fried rice etc...and my go to Chinese foods...China hot wok"}
{"text":"Been here several times before, when my folks lived about a mile away. Never went wrong with the taste and quantity.
Moved my folks to North Las Vegas and tried Chinese food in that area, but never as good as China Hot Wok. 
So when in the mood for Chinese, this is the place to go for great taste.
I have ordered different foods from them and have never gone wrong, always an enjoyment to eat their food."}
{"text":"The lunch special only 6.58. Come with fried rice and noodles. Also get cup drink and appetizers for one dollar together. Unbeatable. Good service. Friendly staff. Best food . Everything made fresh to order . No msg on preparing food . My favorite place ."}
{"text":"Yuck.
Ordered delivery from here and was a pretty bad experience.
We got General Tso chicken, extra spicy, and also orange chicken. The food arrived cold, it had been sitting for so long that the steam had formed cold water on the lid and was dripping back onto the chicken and made it soggy. To throw in another complaint, the General Tso chicken was not spicy at all.

I'm usually not a picky eater, and can chow through even a mediocre meal. A couple bites and I couldn't stomach anymore, I ended up just eating cold rice and a fortune cookie. Talk about a waste of money. Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant using Yelp. After going over the reviews I decided to give it a try. After placing my order with the very polite woman who answered my call. I proceeded to give her my card information, after repeating myself FIVE times! She repeatedly told me that my card was \"invalid\" and it was most likely because they didn't accept my particular card. Note that I use a nation wide bank and even when I go to small hole in the wall towns that barely one has heard of for work, small business owners accept my card! Regardless I had to cancel my order, I may attempt another order if they can accept debit cards!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch while traveling towards Utah. Kung Pao Shrimp was lightening fast and lunch combo came with a ton of food!! Just the right amount of spicy and very friendly staff, a must if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've never been big on fast food Chinese. I've never found a place that uses 100% real chicken breast. It's usually processed. And this place uses the same thing. 

I ordered a ton of stuff for dinner last night. Even though it was just me at home. But, I knew my fiance would want something to snack on later. 
They actually added 3 little things in that I didn't even order. 

What I had:

Spring rolls - Finally. I found my favorite in town. Some of them have way too much celery, but this one was yummy. 
Spicy Garlic Chicken - I ordered spicy. This wasn't even mild. And it was pretty sweet. This was my least favorite. 
Honey walnut Shrimp - to my surprise, this was insanely delicious. It's usually way too breaded, heavy and tiny shrimp. Nope. They used tempura batter, and it was awesome. Highly recommended. 
Salt and Pepper wings - good, but just be ready to want some kind of sauce. 

They added - Crab Rangoons and Pot Stickers. The rangoons were super tasty, but the pot stickers, not so much. 

Overall, this place was probably the best fast food Chinese I've had in our area. Fast service, super friendly and of course, an added bonus for throwing in a couple of things. If they saw how little I was, they probably wouldn't have added it."}
{"text":"Had to try this place out because of all the positive reviews and YES yelp did not fail me today! I have to say this is Best Chinese food ever that I have came across. It's not close to my home so it sucks that we can not have  delivery but I honestly don't mind driving over here for take out or dine in! This is now my go to spot for Chinese."}
{"text":"You would think that no matter how bad the rest of the food is, a Chinese place should have their fried rice unlocked and on the point. Sad to say I won't be eating here anymore, it is just horrible. Very bad smell, sour taste, rice over-cooked, just sad.

The lady at the counter was super friendly and pleasant and that's the only +"}
{"text":"Ordered through Yelp 24 and thought I would get halfway decent Chinese food everything was disgustingly greasy to the point that all this oil pooled at the bottom of the bag...the salt and pepper chicken wings were more like oily greasy chicken wings. I literally just threw it in the trashcan and requested a refund from Yelp. Yelp needs to monitor restaurants listed on their website*yuck*"}
{"text":"Best spot we have found for delivery!  Food is always hot and very good.  Great prices too,  our favorite Chinese spot. 

Update -  Since we have ordered from this spot many time over the last few months I needed to update with 5 stars again.  Every order is delivered hot, fast and at a fair price.  The food is always great quality and tastes great!  The best Chinese delivery ever!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I ordered a Chinese chicken salad, beef chow mein, and a dinner combo plate from my girlfriend and I. They had the food ready to go in about 15 minutes. I got home to my starving girlfriend, and we chowed. The food was delicious! I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a quick fix for Chinese food."}
{"text":"I saw all the great reviews for China Hot Wok and decided to give them a try. As with every other type of cuisine, reviews are subjective. I ordered a pretty healthy sized order for the family; 2 orders of chicken skewers, 2 orders of pot stickers, 2 orders of BBQ Pork Fried Rice, 1 order of NY Style Chow Mein (Chicken), 1 order of NY Style Chow Mein (Pork), and 1 order of Sesame Chicken. 
The food smelled amazing as we drove home to eat!! But, there were some issues. Here's what we liked / disliked:
Chicken Skewers: The chicken was rubbery, and had a strange sort of glaze on it.
Pot Stickers: The meat inside was not very appealing, had a weird taste / smell to it.
BBQ Pork Fried Rice: Pretty darn good!! Would order this again.
NY Style Chow Mein: Also very good, but they forgot to give us the crispy noodles that go with the dish, which you need to offset all those veggies. I'd order this again, but I'd check to make sure I got those crispy noodles.
Sesame Chicken: Ummm...not like any Sesame Chicken I've ever had before. It was basically Orange Chicken with sesame in top. 
All in all, now that I realized this place is only one exit away from my normal Chinese go to (Chop Chop Wok), I think I'll drive the extra mile and a half to get it how I like it."}
{"text":"They have online ordering and had my order ready when I arrived. Decent service for the short time I was inside. The food was good,  but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was good (nothing special), price is average. I like the chow mein noodles because they were thicker and not full of cabbage. I ordered regular fried rice but ended up with the combination which isn't a big deal I just hate having to pick all the stuff out. Overall it seems pretty comparable to any other Chinese food place as far as flavor goes"}
{"text":"China Hot Wok is really more of a 3.5 for me, but because of the stellar service and the 8 free wings we got (with a purchase over $30), I bumped my rating up to 4 stars. China Hot Wok is located in the Albertson's shopping center off Craig and Tenaya. While there is seating available inside, China Hot Wok is best suited for take-out orders. This small fast-food joint is very similar to the set ups of China A GoGo and China One. My family ventured over here on Christmas day for lunch - China Hot Wok graciously resumed its normal business hours on this holiday. We dined in and ended up having a kind of Chinese buffet. 

VEGGIE EGG ROLLS ($1.98, x2): the nice young lady working behind the counter brought out 4 egg rolls instead of 2 and said there was a mistake in the kitchen. Score for us! The veggie egg rolls tasted great. 4/5

SALT AND PEPPER CHICKEN WINGS (FREE, reg. $7.98): There's coupons on the menu that we spotted. We asked the waitress if we could use them, and we did! Can't beat free. My parents and husband were fans. 4/5

BEEF BROCCOLI ($9.28): Never fails, my husband always orders this at Chinese places. No complaints from him! 4/5

ORANGE CHICKEN ($8.98): Dad said it was a-ok. 3/5 Huge portion (but everything served here was gargantuan, to be fair).

CHICKEN CHOP SUEY ($8.98): Mom loved her entree. 5/5

EGGPLANT TOFU ($7.98): I ordered this because it was supposed to be spicy. I wish it was spicier. The eggplant kind of weirded me out, so I just ate the tofu and rice (the texture of the eggplant was too soggy for my liking). I wouldn't order this again, but I would be interested in coming back and ordering another menu item. 3/5

*All entrees came with white rice. The waitress brought out 3 plates of rice and asked if we needed more!*  

Everyone left full and satisfied, so I'd say we had a good run at China Hot Wok. :)

{"text":"Sometimes, you are just not in the mood to drive over to Chinatown for authentic Chinese cuisine. It is so refreshing to have a qualitative family owned Chinese restaurant in a Northwest Las Vegas. They have affordable lunch specials, family meals, and they offer catering services. Sherrie and her staff consistently go above and beyond to delight their customers. They appear to have a pretty loyal following too.

I hosted a few corporate events and the crew at China Hot Wok made them all huge successes. Believe it or not, food has the power to make or break an event. They delivered piping hot and delicious Chinese food from Northwest Las Vegas to North Las Vegas (near the Aliante) which was nearly 20 miles each way. 

The following are my recommendations, but feel free to try everything on the menu:

My daughter and I love their vegetable egg rolls and for only $2 they're a steal.  Their chow mein and fried rice with or without meat are very tasty. I highly suggest their chicken & vegetables--if your feeling healthy, Mongolian beef, orange chicken, beef & broccoli, sweet & sour chicken, or egg foo young. Just keep in mind that the portions are very large."}
{"text":"Was craving Chinese food but wanted a night in. Unfamiliar with the area got on Eat 24/7 and they were right around the corner.  Ordered online and delivery was fast. The young man who delivered was extremely pleasant and overjoyed at a robust tip. The food was fresh and hot with steam still rising as containers were opened. Ordered chow mien, lettuce wraps and walnut shrimp which were all delish!!! Bonus unlike PF Changs that chops water chestnuts as an additive to their lettuce wraps this little fantastic take out joint does not; it was all chicken. The other dishes were truly fantastic. It's affordable and worth a try."}
{"text":"Your coupon offers four egg rolls over $10 and there is another free egg roll with lunch. That amounts to five egg rolls on the lunch and butterfly shrimp I ordered. I even kidded with the woman about loading me up with egg rolls. Got two egg rolls and no crispy noodles. Not good."}
{"text":"I thought price is fair and food good. Customer service very good! They even offered a free chow mein !!"}
{"text":"In terms of Chinese AMERICAN food, this place is the best. Generous portions and great flavor; we still can't get over how much value China Hot Wok offers it's customers. I would recommend the Mongolian beef and black bean fish Lunch Special. Each Lunch Special comes with an entree and fried rice and noodles. Their chow mein noodles are really good! Get an extra plate of the noodles. The chefs really know how to work a wok. A definite must-try."}
{"text":"Really good honey walnut shrimp.  Ordered delivery.   Wasn't expecting it nearly as quickly as it came.  Was really pleased with the whole experience.   Delicious and quick.  What else could I have hoped for."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is whatever.  Looks like a typical mom and pop Chinese place. But the food, the taste, the look, the quantity even, are phenom. So good. Mongolian beef is great. Noodles are good too. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Surprised with hand made dumplings in our delivery order which were puffy and delicious! Delivery was fast and the food was just what I needed to please my chinese food cravings."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and awesome staff. I have ordered probably 20 times here now, and every time is awesome. The pan fried dumplings are the best I have ever had. I will literally get 2 orders of dumplings now for dinner. The staff is great, both in store and to-go. Always greeting with a smile and excellent service. If you eat in, they are very attentive without \"hovering.\" In to-go situations, they get your order prepared fast, and make pick-up super easy. Really, the only negative I have had here, and it isn't enough to lose a star, is the delivery people. Everyone has always looked pissed off that they had to deliver some food to me. One was even walking back to his car less then 30 seconds after ringing my doorbell (one time)."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was quick defiantly will get our Chinese food form here all the time.  The shrimp was fresh and everything had tones of flavor."}
{"text":"For the first time ever,  I ordered takeout for dinner thru the Yelp app, which takes you to  eat24 another app for takeout and delivery. ordering was really easy, we got the family dinner A, which comes with 2 entrees on a specific list. steamed or pork fried rice, hot sour soup or egg drop soup, and 2 crab ragoon and 2 spring rolls. there's an option to pay cash or credit card. and then you get sent an email
where you can check the status of the order and the time it can be picked up. how easy is that? I have to say I was a little wary because of stories where orders are placed online, fax or phone,  you get there and food is not ready or they can't find the order, so you wait again, or leave hungry and exasperated. but for my first time it worked and it was seamless.

Now for the food, it was ready at the counter when we went in. we ended up getting the Mongolian beef, general tsao chicken and hot Sour soup. these are our usual in rotation with the beef broccoli at any Chinese restaurant. my daughter was in heaven! she said it was the best Chinese and was happy we got takeout. The hot sour soup was the best I had. they put good size shrimp and imitation crab in there. it comes with won ton strips  to put on top. the Mongolian beef was flavorful, we got medium spice and it was tender. they also stir fry bell peppers and onions with it, makes me wonder what the pepper beef is like? the general tsao chicken was crispy and tender under the sauce they use also had peppers, onions , carrots and pineapple which I don't mind the veggies, but at other restaurants it doesn't come that way. crab ragoon is better than any other I've had. at least you can see the crab and it's jt sweet. spring rolls aren't anything special. it's basically cabbage with a tiny bit for carrot. I would have like to see more carrot and some onion in there. it would make a difference and set it apart from others. 

All in all, this place is very good for the 2 times we've been.  I can't believe we haven't been more. the other time it was at lunch takeout and it's pretty sizeable portions.its very fast, it's chinese after all.icant imagine they would take more than 10mins to prepare. I'd never get delivery, I'm so close, but not close enough to walk and pick up to take home, well maybe if I didn't have a car."}
{"text":"I thought the delivery was fast and the food was decent! Not gonna blow you away its basically your run of the mill Chinese take out joint but you love it for what it is! I'll keep ordering just cause I'll crave Chinese once and a while and they got it and it's good"}
{"text":"Good take out w/fresh ingredients and generous portions.  Big menu of wok-cooked Chinese fare served fast and furious.  I was not as impressed w/the flavors of the food as apparently others were.  Not a good dine in place but gr8 lunch specials.  Sea bass in black bean sauce is good."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely fantastic!!! We are big-time yelpers and neither one of us are the huge fans of Chinese food both very picky when it comes to it!!! With that said we locate at this place with her the less than a couple of miles from our house from the time we walked in super friendly service everything we ordered was absolutely fantastic!!! From the war wonton soup the honey walnut shrimp Hong Kong noodles as well as their egg rolls absolutely to die for!!!! Their portions are huge and the leftovers are even better the next day!!! Would definitely try delivery next time as the reviews are great on it and I believe everything would come piping hot as well as top-quality"}
{"text":"This was my first time using this app I have to say I was impressed , and the food was awesome, and portions were very generous.  Delivery was fast, this is my restaurant when I am working!!!"}
{"text":"I was house/dog sitting for my cousin an was being lazy so I ordered in. I found this place on Eat24 and decided I'll try it. Everything was hot when it got there, tasted great, and all that I ordered. The fried rice was my favorite! Will order from them again! I only gave 4 stars because there wasn't anything that was just \"OH MY GOD YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS\""}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" spot for lunch or dinner - at least a couple of times a week.. The owner is always super welcoming and friendly.. The food is always consistently delicious.. 

They have a broad vegetarian selection.. The sautéed veggies and fried tofu never fails.  Sesame balls for desert is the best!"}
{"text":"Ooh La La! I wish there was one in Henderson! ABSOLUTELY AWESOME Chinese food.....and those Chinese donuts! I tried to overdose on them. I'll have to drive over here just to come to China Hot Wok!!!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here . They have really big portions which is good but the food was flavorless to me. The price was still pretty moderately priced . I won't be back I rather eat Thai food or China Mama next time!"}
{"text":"We ordered and we were told it would be a 45-60 minute wait for delivery. We called after an hour and fifteen minutes and were told it would be another ten minutes. We called 25 minutes after that and were told it would be another ten minutes, but they would take $10 off. 
So we waited another twenty minutes and haven't heard anything, we call the location and THEY DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE!  They have already charged the credit card and we don't have food.
If you want a timely delivery, a trustworthy company, LOOK ELSEWHERE. One of the Worst experiences we have ever had."}
{"text":"China Hot Wok was an excellent choice for great food an quick service.  You get real Chinese food from this family operation.  They would get five stars, but we ate in and they served on styrofoam.  If you're a take-out customer you will love it."}
{"text":"I just ordered here for the very first time today. I have to say I am impressed! 
Food came fast about 25min, hot and fresh! 
Their donuts were amazing! My boys really liked the orange chicken! I also got a strawberry boba tea...which was delicious! Will be ordering from this place again!"}
