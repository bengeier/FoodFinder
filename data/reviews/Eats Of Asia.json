{"text":"I love this place. I wish I was eating Taiwanese pork rice right now."}
{"text":"Had the Ramen dish, it was so salty I barely finished the noodles! Left the bowl of broth. I've had other dishes here that was not bad, but they seem to concentrate on being too \"hip and cool\" than customer service. Anyways, probably had my last meal here."}
{"text":"I'm not one to purposely buy anything overly spicy ( as in hot) but the bibimbap was liberally doused with hot sauce. Needless to say, I powered through it because it didn't take away from all the deliciousness happening in my bowl. Fried sunnyside up egg, mushrooms, fluffy white rice ect. . . It was very filling.  My bf loved his thick dandan noodles, which surpassed my meal in the heat catagory. He also sweat it out and finished his bowl clean because the food of Eats of Asia is just that good."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend in Calgary for the weekend.  While there we watched a documentary on Netflix about ramen noodles. This gave us a huge craving for authentic Japanese ramen which we needed to satisfy.   After a couple of failed attempts at other places we found this place on yelp, called to confirm ramen, and decided to make the trek.   The 5 star reviews are accurate, this place did not disappoint.  My first visit ever and now I will make the pilgrimage whenever I visit Calgary.   Ramen noodles in a wonderful broth with just the right amount of spice. Soft boiled egg, pulled pork, mushrooms, green onions, the works!  I forgot what other magical ingredients went into this Asian love potion, but I'm under it's spell."}
{"text":"Eats of Asia is good at seasoning items just right, such as the laksa soup and the lucky pig bao. It would be very easy to make either of these too salty, or under spiced, but these pitfalls are deftly avoided here. The texture of the bao bun, and the rendering of the pork belly are spot on for a melt in your mouth sammy. A small rotating menu allows them to focus on honing the food. Five stars for the great combination of street food prices and high quality preparation"}
{"text":"One of the best if not the best Asian restaurant I have ever been (in this category and price point), the quality of the ingredients and the execution are top notch, we try to eat there as often as possible, we live the teriyaki chicken, the Dan dan noodles and the crispy pork belly rice, I strongly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Not very good ramen. Price was steep for w bowl the size of mr. Noodle package worth of soup.   Flavours did not work, meat was extremely fatty and stringy. They cracked a near raw egg into soup, but broth was not hot enough to continue cooking.   Skip to the Mexican place, best in town"}
{"text":"I hoped one day I'd get to try their famous bao dishes I've drooled over while watching Jay's videos on YouTube.  This food is simple but wondrously full of flavor and it feels good to finish 2 and not feel super fool.  I got the lucky pig and the chicken baos - next time I'll get 2 lucky pigs because braised pork is soooo good.  I don't know when they'll be open more than just on Thursdays, but today I was lucky because they were here on a Sunday.  cheers!"}
{"text":"Had the kimchi ramen today. The noodles were good, but the broth was tasteless. Won't go back. Service was nice."}
{"text":"Bi...bim...bap! The only dish I tried so far and I love it! Fresh and full of flavor. They also offer other bowls, soups, steamed buns, and snacks. Everything looks pretty tasty. The price is good as well. You can pay with cash or debit.  Seating can be a bit difficult if it's a very busy day, but the place is located in the \"food court\" where you can usually find a spot to sit down.  For drinks they offer the usual water/pop, and also a Kaffeklatsch cold brew coffee."}
{"text":"Dan Dan noodles are my favourite bough the lucky pig bao is a close second. Definitely THE place to visit when you are at Crossroads Market."}
{"text":"Loved loved this place! After walking around the flea market section at Crossroads Market I was starving, which means deciding on a place to eat? Hopeless. Being as hungry as I was I don't think I knew what my expectations were but this place exceed them anyway!   I love a good bibimbap , if I see it on a menu that is what I order. Maybe it's a phase, maybe it's not but I can't get enough. The bibimbap here did not disappoint, mmmm yum.  My husband ordered what I think was the special? It was a crispy teriyaki chicken thing/mybraindoesnotremember all I know is that I would order either again in a heartbeat.  Service? Super friendly, awesome, perfectly rounded out a great meal. (that is to me what turns a 4 star review into 5 stars)  Next time I go to Crossroads this will for sure be my first stop."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's close to my shop, so I eat here loads and have never had a bad experience. Staff is always friendly and the food is always good, and even great on occasion. For instance, the Dan Dan noodles, Chicken & Waffles & Korean Dirty Fries are knockouts!"}
{"text":"The food was good just not what I was expecting. I had heard a lot about their ramen but they didn't have any on their regular menu. I tried the bibimbap and it was good. The Asian tater tots were definitely my favourite item! Those are a must try. Portion sizing is decent."}
{"text":"Were you sad this weekend when you went to Market on Macleod, hoping for Bao happiness and instead were greeted by a Hold the Mustard sign and no one else?  Just like Sister Mary Clarence, I will follow Eats of Asia wherever they will go. They've got a huge stall now in Crossroads Market, complete with a Ramen Bar, all the J's, and Groot! The food here is as good as ever, and if you've got dietary issues and restrictions, these guys are more than willing to accommodate you.   There aren't any vegan specific items on the menu, but Jay fixes up a wonderfully filling vegan bibimbap that I'm trying to get named after me. They also manage to do Asian fusion well; blending Filipino, Korean, Chinese and even Hawaiian flavors without muting their delectability or making it taste like Westernized dysphoria. If you're a heat fiend, their gochujang is just as scrumtralescent as sriracha, and they're not stingy with it. Suck it up and power through that gochujang basket weave.   The specials change weekly, so you won't get bored! May want to stop a few stalls down afterward for an espresso though, in case you have to drive home. Side effect of bibimbap: Sudden and propulsive urges to nap, AKA, Itis."}
{"text":"When I'm cold and hungry, and there are wolves after me, I know Jay and Co. have my back.   Eats of Asia doesn't have anything vegan specific on the menu, but talk to any of the 3 J's behind the counter (tangent: \"I finally know what the J in my middle name stands for! It stands for... JAY!\" - Homer), and they'll whip up something tree-hugger suitable.   You don't even have to look presentable! I rolled in, post-gym, hair askew and dripping sweat, and they still made me the coziest bowl of Bibimbap goodness. I daydream about that eggplant. Nuggets of heaven. Why is every dish made from eggplants, delightful to say? Baba ghanoush. Bibimbap. VEGANBAP! Blitzkrieg bap?  ZAP."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of eating at Eats of Asia two times so far and I'm super glad to see them in the Kingsland Farmers' Market on Thursdays and soon-to-be full time. The Bao Sliders are super good, the lucky pork is melt in your mouth tender and flavourful. Today I was finally able to try the Dandan Noodles and let me tell you, HOLY SHIT! Super flavourful and frankly... addictive. I can't wait for next Thursday, I think I have a new tradition."}
{"text":"For months I've been watching videos of New York chef's and foodies brag about their Bao sliders, even prompting me to buy a cookbook so I can make my own. Seemed simple, steam your bread dough, slow roast your protein, savory sweet sauce, and a touch of fresh component. It was ok, and my friends said it was ok. But it lacked a master's touch and I wasn't about to fly off somewhere to get a taste.  Until I started seeing my social media feed with pictures and videos. Until one day I realized the Bao has arrived in Calgary. Who better to bring it than Jay Del Coro and Eats of Asia.  For a while I've wanted to check out EoA. Their millarville location was too far for me to reach and could never find the opportune time to go. But I love that they're doing pop-ups now, making frequent visits to Kingsland.  The bao bun was perfect. It's the simplest list of ingredients but so easy to screw up. Cook it too raw it's gross and doughy, cook it too much you get melting gruel in your hands. These buns were light, fluffy to the bite, and had a complimentary sweetness to it's delectable packages. The fillings were creative chicken adobo cooked in coconut sauce sprinkled with toasted coconut, braised pork belly wonderfully nestled on a bed of hoisin sauce and crushed peanuts. There were also vegetarian option of shitake mushrooms that I didn't get to try. Overall, aside from it being a wonderful eating experience, it was an educational one as well, certainly worth the $$$ just to see and TASTE what Jay has been   The prices were great. It was easy to convince coworkers on the Bao's. Nothing like strolling in to try EoA for the first time ordering 8 orders and receiving a look of suspicion. Yeah, I could've probably eaten them all.  Can't wait for my second visit!"}
{"text":"From its chops to its bacon, you already know the pig is a delicious animal, and you haven't even tried Lucky Pig Bao from Eats of Asia yet. You, my friend, are in for a treat!  Inside this Market on Macleod stand just big enough for a full sized human to stand in let alone work, from Thursday-Sunday, 9-5, you'll find the owner, Jay, or one of his kin and some of the most forward thinking asian street cuisine this city has to offer. They encourage you to stay adventurous as the menu is always changing, but some of the staples you'll come across include hand pulled dandan noodles, Korean Dirty Fries, chicken and waffles, various bao sliders including my love - the Lucky Pig."}
{"text":"Eats of Asia has new digs at the Crossroads Farmers Market in the new renovated area. It was Alberta Burger Fest week so I stopped off to sample their offering. Teriyaki pork belly patty, sweet teriyaki sauce and fresh scallions on pressed rice \"buns\" in roasted nori wrapper for a mere $10. Of the three burgers I sampled this past week it was the best. Jay and his assistant John are passionate about food and it's obvious in the dishes they come up with. It's a great stop for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Eats of Asia resides in a corner spot in the Crossroads Market. With a variety of dishes on the menu including Ramen, Bi Bim Bap and various other noodle bowls, I had a hard time choosing a dish.   On this visit, with the featured meat was pulled pork. I decided to try this on their Bi Bim Bap, which came with a generous portion of meat, their homemade sauce, chopped nuts and a perfectly runny egg in addition to the fresh vegetables and rice.   Overall, great dish and friendly service. At around $12 a meal, the prices are a bit high for the environment, but not too bad."}
{"text":"o had the pork bao steam buns one time,  excellent and the chef will cook it as well as you like.  yhe nokdle soup and meat bowls are amazing as well.  thai currey chicken is just the best.  the real draw is the fusion eats on steam buns."}
{"text":"I don't get to eat here as often as I wish I could- but when I have, it is always great.  After much angst because there looked to be so many tasty dishes-I finally decided on the poke bowl.  Each component of the dish was delicious- the kimchee, the salmon, the tamago, etc were each well crafted- but then all together, holy yum!!  I love burrito bowls, and now love an Asian version of that- with the poke bowl.  Thanks for another delicious meal!!"}
{"text":"I finally managed to get to the Kingsland market to try out EOA. I haven't been there for many months but was shocked at how dead it was and how many empty stalls there were..... But that's a whole other review.  After picking up a couple of things we went to grab lunch and got a chance to look at the menu. As usual we wanted to try several things so we ordered:  Lucky Pig Bao Phoenix Bao Dan Dan noodles Spam Musubi  The Bao were delicious! The bun was the right texture and the ingredients were perfect. All three of us preferred the Phoenix because of the crunchy texture of the chicken but they were both great.   The Spam Musubi was great too. They found the perfect balance of everything and it tasted like the ones we had in Hawaii. It seems like a strange combination (Spam, rice and teriyaki sauce wrapped in nori) but somehow it works. Definitely a win in my house.  We were disappointed with the noodles. I have had Dan Dan Noodles at other places and loved them but nobody in my family liked this version. The noodles seemed undercooked and gummy and were all clumped together. The toppings/ingredients were flavourful but because of the noodles we didn't even eat 1/4 of the dish. I can't decide if they were prepared incorrectly or if I just don't like their version but either way I likely won't order it again to find out.  I went with 4 stars because the dishes that we liked, we really liked. We got our order pretty quickly and the guy working was pleasant. We will definitely go again to try other dishes (Korean fried chicken and waffles? Yes please!) and to get our Bao fix."}
{"text":"Very happy with this menu! Street food served is a very authentic way. Some foods don't need to be flashy they need to feel real and taste great. Poke bowls, ramen, and spam can't serve Asian cuisine without one but to get all 3!! THANK YOU!!"}
{"text":"Really overrated. Everything I have tried is very bland and does not taste authentic. They mask it with sauce but there is no cohesion in the taste. Meaning you taste the meat and sauce separately . It really is not good compared to REAL Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"This place leaves an impression of vibrancy and creativity!! They change up their menu every week, and the street food theme is really cool. I ordered a salmon congee--the crisp fish skin was delicious with buttery pieces of salmon and a perfect onsen tamago. HOWEVER, my mom ordered a bowl of inedibly salty ramen. By 3pm, they had apparently let the broth reduce too much. Neither of us could take more than two bites. For $10, I would 10/10 not recommend. It's quality food in a vibrant setting with regular customers, but I would not come out specially for this place."}
{"text":"You know how when something or somebody amazes touches your skin or lands on the shirt you're wearing and you swear that you'll never wash it again? That's how I'm feeling about the food I ate from Eats of Asia today. I held off for HOURS on eating or drinking anything else to let those flavourful afternotes linger in my mouth as long as I could.  I made my way through a spam musubi, lucky pig bao and dan dan noodle bowl. The spam musubi is far better than anything you'd get at the local convenience store in Hawaii, you must try it! Lucky pig bao, oh my goodness, like an open-faced steam bum served up with braised pork belly, hoisin, cilantro and crushed peanuts. Remember your napkins for this one. If you're extra hungry, you HAVE to try a bowl, the dan dan noodle bowl is a fun show as they hand pull the noodles before cooking them. Once ready, they get all gussied up with pork, veg, sweet shiitake mushrooms and dusted with some crushed peanuts on top. Those noodles are sooooo soft! Loved the flavours coming out of this noodle bowl with a fun amount of spice to it too.  Being street food inspired, this food is best eaten on the go, however, if you want to sit and take a load off, grab a stool and talk Asian food shop! You'll love it! I promise!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite hidden gem in the city. It just makes me so happy every time I come here. I have yet to try something here that was subpar. My go-tos: Dan dan noodles: great chewy noodle texture, super flavourful pork, love the pickled vegetables. Pork belly baos: how have these perfect things not blown up on yyc. We need a bao revolution. Not on the menu the last few times I was there, bring it back PLS! Lastly the red curry Thai chicken rice bowl. Crispy chicken in a deliciously sweet spicy Thai curry sauce. Oh god im drooling now."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem, and I much prefer the Crossroads location to the one at CFM (but miss the one at Market on Macleod, but so it goes). Brilliant, creative Asian fusion that still manages to take its Asian (Filipino, Korean, Japanese, etc) roots very seriously and with great respect. I love almost everything I've ever had here but return to my faves: the spam musubi, which is SO MUCH BETTER than that garbage version of this delicacy at places like 7-11 in Hawaii, and the teriyaki chicken, which elevates this dish in way that I'd never have thought possible. Eat it in the market if you can."}
{"text":"Visiting Crossroads market is part of my weekend routine so Eats of Asia has quickly become my go-to place for lunch on the weekends. Situated in the main food court area, Eats of Asia is a take on Asian street food from ramen, dandan noodles, crispy sisig, soups, baos, chicken skins, japatots to rice bowls, they've got all the street food everyone craves! I was first introduced to Eats of Asia's baos...boy are baos amazing. Lucky pig is my favorite, melt in your mouth braised pork belly, hoisin, cilantro, peanuts. Phoenix is a close second with fried chicken (I LOVE fried chicken), hoisin, negi and peanuts all wrapped in steam baos, they are truly small pockets full of flavor - they've got other baos which are just as good but I've listed my personal favorite. I've also tried the hand pulled dandan noodles which are pretty good too - the only thing is, the noodles are soooo long it can get kind of messy, tasty but messy.   Something new that has made an appearance at Eats of Asia is the poke bowls. I LOVE poke bowls, you get to choose the main protein, rice or salad, sauce, 3 mix ins and toppings, it's quite the refreshing treat. It's not comparable to poke bowls in the states but it makes a good substitute!  I could eat poke bowls all day every day and wouldn't feel guilty at all.   Eats of Asia is one of those places you don't want to miss.  All their food is tasty and definitely worth trying! I'd say go earlier as they can run out of the popular items! But NEWS FLASH - they will be opening another location at the Calgary's Farmers Market - yippeee!!"}
{"text":"This place is an amazing hidden secret. Dandan noodles with tofu were incredible. Such a feisty combination of flavors. Complete with handmade Korean noodles.  I can't wait to try every other damn thing on the menu!!"}
