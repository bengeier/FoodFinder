{"text":"Seen this restaurant on TV, went with my wife I was very impressed the food was out standing,
Even the Bar had a good atmosphere, we had the salad bar along with our entries it was great,
Wine was good also."}
{"text":"This was our second time visiting the restaurant for lunch.  Food was much better the first time.  The service is extremely poor.  Waitress kept hiding in the kitchen.  Will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Solid food.  The waitstaff didn't seem to know a lot about the food or the beer though."}
{"text":"Excellent Bavarian restaurant! Dishes made fresh with authentic seasonings. Very large lunch schnitzel left more than enough for a second full meal! Goulash soup enough for a meal in itself. Sauerbraten again made to perfection! Only drawback is they ran out of strudel and this is Tuesday. So had chocolate Ganesh which was out of this world... Too bad I don't live nearby, or maybe is a good thing?"}
{"text":"We were not able to try the food on a Tuesday evenong. After 45 minutes, all we had was water. The waitress was complaining the entire time about being overworked. We will never return, and will strongly advise against eating there."}
{"text":"Went there this evening and wish I had read the reviews first and saved my $20.00. Went home hungry. The hot bread was nice, but the butter was melted because the room was too warm. The salad bar was sad. I ordered the sauerbraten dinner - the meat was tender, but the 'dumpling' was this big heavy thing that had no taste at all. Yes, the place looks very shabby with dirty ceiling tiles ready to drop. Very disappointing as I was really looking forward to some good German food!"}
{"text":"I am grading a 4-star review mostly because the food is second to none. The hostess moved really slow and he didn't quite seem like he knew what he was doing. However, the food is the best. The Madagaskar is the best steak I have ever had, cooked to perfection. If they updated the place and possibly the staff, this place has some potential, just a little outdated."}
{"text":"This is by far some of the worst German food I've tasted. My wife and I ordered the jäger schnitzel and it was totally bland. They had a salad bar which was fresh. We were also the only people in the place. I should've known better when we walked in, but I always give places the benefit of the doubt, try it once kind of thing. Yelp wants me to put some mustard on this review, but I just don't have much else to say about this very bland place. One more thing, the service was good."}
{"text":"The beer and the lamb were great! Had the lamb shank, which was very good - falling off the bone - sauce was perfect as well. The potatoes and green beans were also done really well. Atmosphere was a bit of a stereotype and you would have expected a polka band to hang out there or something. Apple strudel was not what I expected and wasn't my favorite. I'd definitely go back though - the entrée and beer warrant it for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by Saturday night for dinner.
The service was very good.
The food was ok,we both agreed on that.
I had the duck  special and was disappointed in the gravy.
Have had better German food but it is worth a try...."}
{"text":"First time eating German cuisine but my wife spent three years in country and wanted to try this out. Also, saw this place on Check Please and the reviews were good. Walked in and immediately realized this place hadn't been updated in years. Very dark and in need of some repair. Staff was nice but kinda slow. Place was not crowded, even on Valentine's Day for lunch. I ordered the trio and the wife ordered weinerschitzel. Salad bar was good and fresh with good choices. Food came out piping hot. The taste was fine for me, but the sauce distracted from the veal flavor. My best portion was plain. Potatoes were good and now I know I don't like spaetzil (so). My wife's dish was good but she had problems with the sauce. Portions were huge and we couldn't finish everything we liked.

I think the place would get a better rating if they would fix up a bit."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times over past two years. The food is fantastic. The first time I ate there I went to kitchen to compliment the cook who is actually the cook and owner. The service was good and the waitress was pleasant."}
{"text":"As a true German, I would never go back to this place! The food was mediocre, very bland and not appealing to me. I had the Jaegerschnitzel and both the sauce and meat almost had no taste at all and the taste of the sauce is key for this dish! They did offer a good variety of typical German meals. It didn't taste horrible and I ate the food because I was hungry, but I passed on the dessert (and I generally don't) since I felt that would be a waste. The waitress was \"funny\", almost authenticity German, even though she wasn't German, but I am not sure how long she would last elsewhere with her \"interesting\" behavior. It was quite busy with a lot of older people. Actually, the place was a little crazy as they only had 2 waitresses, so the wait was quite long. The interior was also very old, like from the 70's, but maybe this how some people envision a traditional German restaurant here. Trust me, this is not how a restaurant in Germany looks these days. I don't think this place has been renovated in 30 years or since they opened many years ago. To the owner: it is time! The tavern attached to the restaurant was ok, at least the bar lady there was awesome. Anyway, I'll rather cook myself if I want to eat good German food. Nevertheless, the experience was interesting :-). I just moved here not too long ago, so had to experience it once."}
{"text":"We wanted to take out-of-town guests for German food and headed to Zur Kates. It turned out to be closed on a Monday evening so we then walked over to Bavarian Point in the same complex because it was open.

The restaurant was almost empty, there were three tables with guests. We were a group of 7 and seated at a table with room for 6. I had to remove a dirty used fork that was in the middle of my placemat. That should have been a clue as to what was to come.

Service was extremely slow, waited a long time for menus and water. Two people in our group (after 3 times asking) finally received their coffee and tea 30 minutes later. 

We asked the waitress for three separate orders and she refused. She said it was because she was the only waitress. I do not understand why that would be a reason, it was a slow night in the restaurant, we were the 4th table for dinner. How hard is it to write three different tabs.

The salad bar was pathetic, had to ask a server for lettuce because the bowl was empty. The chilled brussel sprouts were tasteless.

I had the Wurst Peanne which had 3 different sausages, sauerkraut and fried potatoes. The sauerkraut was so overcooked, soggy, tasteless and inedible in my opinion. The fried potatoes were just about as bad, they were extremely bland. About the only thing I enjoyed was the bread placed at the table. I took two of the sausages home but left the potatoes and sauerkraut in the pan.

Some of our other guests had the Jagerschnitzel and we have never seen schnitzels cut so thin. The two small slices each were an 8th of an inch thick. We have been all through Germany many, many times and we had never had a schnitzel like this before. Very disappointing.

Also the waitress was rude (but I think more lazy) by having the guest pass the menus around the table and she also did this with three take out boxes. She had me reach in front of the person to my right to get my box. 

We apologized to our guests for such a horrible dinner and next time we will wait and take them to Zur Kate's. This is not the restaurant to go to if you want German food."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Germany.  I came here last night to entertain my boyfriend and his family.  We showed up at about 6:45 pm and I don't believe we were served before 7:45 pm.  The restaurant was packed as was the bar (which surprised me for being in that part of Mesa), so we seated ourselves in the bar, where we each had a drink.  $21 bucks, not bad for four.  I had my \"dreckigen\" (the 'dirty'), or \"coke-beer\" for those who don't know, and it was refreshing.  They serve you in large glasses too but the beer is so smooth, it really goes down easy. 
When we were seated and looked at the menu, none of us could decide on one thing.  It all looked great and of course, by now we were just starving.  We each made an order, I got the \"Schweinebraten\" (Pork with dumplings and sauerkraut).  
We were then served bread and asked to help ourselves at the full salad bar.  The salad bar had lots to offer, and certainly helped to hold us over for dinner. 
I was a little embarassed how long it finally took to get our food.  It's pretty custom to have to wait for your meals in Germany.  When you order, you must expect a wait of at least 30 minutes but I wasn't accustomed to that anymore (call me americanized!).  But fortunately everyone was fine (thanks to the great bread and salad bar) and we weren't in a rush. 
Once dinner finally came (and the restaurant started to clear out slowly), everyone seemed happy with their dish.  I really should have ordered a Schnitzel, the pork was too 'smokey' for me, and the dumplings were not the kind I enjoy, but if you enjoy pork, you should be able to enjoy this dish.  I was trying to be 'different' and go for something 'new' but usually there is a reason why you like what you like and why you should probably stick to what you like ;)
Point is, we all had a good time, the plates were big, we went home with left overs, I think it was a nice experience and I do recommend it.

Just make sure you get the Schnitzel or Wurst next time ;)"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing.  Rare to find such high quality authentic food.  I would say don't go in there if you are in a hurry, but I actually found it to be refreshing to not be shoved in and shoved out.  The place is not a chain, which means that it's not going to be polished shined (and utterly crap) but is a place focused on making you great food in a comfortable environment.  The live accordion player was a really nice touch as well."}
{"text":"Chicken and spinach appetizer and Wersteiner beer an all time favorite of mine for 10 yrs  never been disappointed, phenomenon service and knowledgeable staff make for a very pleasant dining experience, highly recommended..love love it"}
{"text":"Bavarian Point shares a street address with another German restaurant, but this one is at the far end of a long row of shops and eating placesand is by far the more upscale of the two.

The meal does not start out auspiciously. Your entree comes with a choice of soup or salad bar. The salad bar  comprised a motley bunch of limp stomach stuffers, so we opted for the soup of the day, which apparently always turns out to be a rather tasteless celery soup. How about giving us a choice of ordering the Goulash soup, even for a buck or two supplement? 

Things greatly improved when the main courses arrived. My brother got the special of the day, an overflowing platter of half a meaty duck with spaetzle. Since I love spaetzle, I offered to relieve him of the excess. They were good!
I ordered a house special called Bauernschnaus. This included tender pork roast, a beef roulade,  a very tasty smoked pork loin, a gigantic but light dumpling, and red cabbage, which I requested in lieu of mashed potatoes (how stuffed can you get?). Excellent choices all around.

Everything was washed down with several of their fine choices of draft German beers, available in three sizes. I needed the 34 ounce Dark Wartsteiner to rightfully polish off my platter. 

Waitress, dressed in Bavarian getup, was  helpful, the ambience  pleasant, and the noise level very moderate.  Some work on the soup selection and/or  salad bar would increase the rating here. I'll check back next time I'm in Phoenix  and let you know."}
{"text":"Loved it! Saw the restaurant on \"Check Please\" and decided to check it out. The food was awesome. The waitstaff was really helpful. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Very cozy and dimly lit place. It has an old world feel. It's a nice place to celebrate an anniversary. I had the beer batter shrimp and they were delicious. They came with boiled potatoes and fresh bread. A nice mixed crowd of happy diners."}
{"text":"Delicious food, but very slow service. I have been here many times and it is always very slow. Every step. Takes forever to get a menu, then drinks, then bread (wanted butter too, but the waitress disappeared again). I understand the kitchen getting backed up; maybe there is just one
cook? But today, we asked for more water that never came. We hoped in vain that she would bring us the bill. Finally, we scrounged together enough cash to leave on the table and got out of there."}
{"text":"I love real German food that has been prepared with quality in mind.  Bavarian Point used to be that way.  No Longer.  
My last visit was a serious disappointment when they brought out an otherwise excellent dish with flaked potatoes mixed with hot water.  
If you know anything about German food, you know that potatoes in many forms is a wonderful staple there.  Flaked potatoes not only taste terrible, but it is an insult to customers and the German culture."}
{"text":"Disgusting food, everything was Gross! Do not eat here! Two hours after being polite and actually eating some of the Jager Schnitzel I was Vomiting! I would give this place a negative star rating if possible."}
{"text":"This is the best German food I have had since I was in Germany back in 2011. Good soft crunchy crust bread. Nice salad bar. Good home made soup. Sausage and sauerkraut so tasty. Jäger schnitzel was cooked just right. Not tough or dry. The Spätzle was eggy and soft. The apple strudel came out warm with a beautiful vanilla sauce on it. Everything was made with love and care. We will be back, even though we live about an hours drive away. Sorry I didn't take any pictures this time. My phone was out of power."}
{"text":"Just love the place. Been coming here for years. Yes the service is a bit slow but sit back enjoy your company and a good beer. The food is second to none."}
{"text":"Yummm! Good food and friendly service. Soups are fantastic! Goulash soup is a meal on its own. Scallops were delicious and their cordon bleu dish as well. Plentiful portions."}
{"text":"The bar is usually my go-to. Nice selection of tasty German beers and the staff is nice enough. The owner is pretty badass too. 

I usually try something different every time I'm here but their lamb shank was one of my favorites. Pork shank is only good if you really like pork. The lunch specials are a pretty good deal for the amount of food you get and the quality is great. The place is usually pretty quiet and kind of dated but I like it. 

Also their tomato soup is the best I've ever had and I usually hate the stuff."}
{"text":"Food was very good; authentic and good sized portions. But that's where I have to stop. Place is not very clean and in dire need of a renovation!  Bathrooms were filthy and the bench seats still had food on them. If they could clean up the place, it would be a place I would go back to. But I'm going to try the other German place a few doors down!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, a relaxed atmosphere, large portions, and outstanding desserts.

For those of you that need someone to come along and tell you where to sit, how to order, how to sit, what to eat, etc. on your \"date night\".....go to Starbucks and get yelled at......leave the seats for someone more appreciative."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere but service was horrible. Since we do not drink alcohol and there were no other options we asked for water. The waitress completely ignored us even though there were only two other tables with customers.  We never received our appetiser and the waitress stated we were not charged for it but we did the math and we were charge for the appetiser. We will never go back to such a disreputable restaurant."}
{"text":"Man this place is cool, the food is great and the staff are wonderful. Yeah the decor is a little dated but who cares, at least it's not some pretentious modern joint that caters to snobs. My wife thought the desert was \"super good\" and I agree. She also really likes the decor and says it's old world, hell she should write this review. Anyway well come again. Rock on."}
{"text":"If you want fabulous German food in Phoenix, this is the place to come. We love the schnitzel-- it's huge--and the apple strudel with vanilla sauce is the best I've had. They have the cutest waitress in her dirndl too."}
{"text":"For those of you who saw this restaurant reviewed on Check Please Arizona last week and are considering parting with some of your hard-earned money, here's a tip...DON'T.  So disappointing on so many levels.  First, the place looks and feels like it's stuck in a time warp of the 1950's. Second, if the best thing you can say about a restaurant is that the bread was pretty good then you have a real problem.  The place is not cheap, either.  Most lunch entrees are $16 - $20 which includes a very mediocre salad bar, the aforementioned bread basket and your entree.  I had the wurst (worse?) plate and my wife had a combination plate of pork, sauerkraut and a dumpling.  Neither of us even wanted to finish our entrees, so we thought maybe the desserts would save the day.  As Lee Corso would say on College Gameday, \"Not so fast, my friend!\"  When the server came over with the bill, we inquired about dessert...to which she replied they were out of desserts...at 12:30 in the afternoon!  She advised us that the Check Please Arizona airing had cleaned them out of all of their top-selling desserts...of which the Apple Strudel and Black Forest cake that we would have ordered were 2.  Obviously they don't make these in-house but buy them from an outside source and didn't buy enough for the week following the show.

That's 2 hours (including drive time) and $40 we won't be getting back.  If you saw the show last week, San Tan Brewery is fantastic...go there instead and enjoy the vibrant environment and the wonderful menu at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for a 3-day seminar.

I look to Yelp for restaurant recommendations and this oftentimes being my home-country German cooking, despite living here since 1980. 

Now this is Saturday evening.
The Bavarian Point Restaurant is oddly enough one of 2 German restaurants in this shopping center. Despite showing a limited menu offering on their website menu, this place being owned and operated by a fellow Bavarian - i had to give this place a try. A bit confused about web comments re. some food already.

The place is a bit dimmer, more 'elegant' then the place down roads, but equally accommodating to families with kids. Has a separate bar section on the other side as i found out when leaving.

The food - OMG - the nicest best waitress one can/could ever have presented me with the limited written menu, then offered recide the 'tonight's' specials..such as Duck, Osso Bucco, Lamb Shanks, oh not to forget the Ham Hocks - and that is just a start! 

They offer soup or salad bar. Salad i can fix at home. Was hoping they would have fresh liver dumpling soup, a very much loved Bavarian soup, as one of their specials that night. No such luck. But the huge container of Goulash soup, over nighted and brought home, excellent as well.

She told me that when the Owner just starts cooking and gets to cooking, he keeps going. I love you Werner! The 1/2 duck, bread dumpling and red cabbage i had, excellent! I have to come from LA to Phoenix to eat the best German food outside of the Fraenkischen Schweiz (my home)/known as little Switzerland outside Germany??

I hope to be back soon. Planning an Atlanta roadtrip already with stops coming and going Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love this place best German restaurant I've ever been in. Family owned and the staff is very friendly. The place is always packed."}
{"text":"What a fun place. We wanted to try something new for an anniversary dinner and stumbled across this gem. Upon entering you are greeted and feel like a regular. Our waitress practically told us what we were going to eat and drink, but not in an off putting way. We both very much enjoyed our meal and were very pleased with the service. The salad bar was really quite exceptional and unexpected."}
{"text":"Excellent!  It's the best way to describe my first time eating German food.   Was recommended my two German women.  A must stop in the Mesa"}
{"text":"Service a little slow to start then was fine after our server was changed.  Our party of 6 tried different entrees and everyone was very pleased  with their selections.  Overall we voted this restaurant as a must return on our list of monthly women's night out."}
{"text":"I come from a very long line of amazing German cooks. 
Bavarian is the only place I have found that holds a candle to moms cooking. The food is very authentic and super tasty. The specials are always great. I prefer to sit in the bar area instead of the dining room. 
I sometimes just stop by here for a great German beer. The clientele is very diverse, but there are definitely a lot of regulars. 
Don't let the exterior fool you. This place is good. Hope to see you there. 

Prost!!"}
{"text":"I lived in Germany for three years so I can expertly review this :-). Food was delicious, portions were huge, salad bar was beyond fresh and lots of variety to include German specialties. Would def go back again."}
{"text":"If I were rating the food only, it would be 3.5-4. The service dragged the score down and would be a 1. First the good, the food. I had the jagerschnitzel, and it was delicious. I would definitely have it again, if we ever go back. Hubby had a platter with 3 meats and a dumpling, and some other stuff. He liked all of it except the dumpling, but he's not used to German food. 

Now the service was terrible. There were only 2 servers and one busser working on a fairly busy night. Our server was rude and talked back to most of the tables around us, did not know the menu items or how to pronounce them, and scoffed at the idea of being German when a customer asked her. I also heard her blaming the busser for not bringing wine to a table and complaining to another table that she was too busy to get to them. If you don't like serving, find another job. Customers don't pay you to be treated poorly and listen to you complain. And I waited tables for 10 years, so I usually have a lot of patience for slow service, but this was just bad. My husband said he won't return because of her. We did see a cute little lady in a German dress who looked to be at least 80 on the other side of the room that looked nicer though."}
{"text":"This is a pathetic place not only is the food discusting but its not run correctly. Save your money.not to mention the owner is a total drunk and jerkoff who tries to pimp out the young stupid girls he hires.also smokes while cooking with no gloves.trashtalkes customers as soon as they leave.this place should be condemned.!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is 5 star quality; however I have been coming here for 25 years and the decor has not changed - it is getting a bit tired looking.  I would take away a star for the decor if the food wasn't so darn yummy.

The food is AMAZING!  My favorite is the jaeger schnitzel and I highly recommend it. The soups change daily and I have never had a bad soup - even soups that I normally don't care for are wonderful here.  I always get the soup instead of the salad bar because you can eat salad anywhere, right?

If you are a vegetarian, this is NOT the place for you! 
If you are watching your caloric intake, this is NOT the place for you!  

You know how they say you eat Chinese food and 30 minutes later you're hungry? When you eat German food, 72 hours later you are hungry!  German food is heavy and rich."}
{"text":"My friends and I keep coming back to Bavarian Point for one main reason - the beer.  The beer selection isn't anything mind-blowing (although it's not bad either), but the fact that you can order 1-liter beers that come in enormous beer glasses larger than your head is a novelty we can't find much of anywhere else.  Oh yeah, and the food's good too, so that doesn't hurt.

We've been a few times now and always have a great time.  I personally feel the food is a little on the expensive side at around $20 an entree, but that's not too pricey.  Most of the food is very good, although I've had one or two things that I would put into the \"just okay\" category.  They also have lots of dinner specials every night, so if you don't see anything on the menu that appeals to you they might have a special that you'd like better.  Dinner also comes with a pretty well-stocked salad bar, so that's a plus.

Service is always excellent - we generally end up talking to our server for awhile when we're here (blame the 1-liter beers) and they're always really friendly and outgoing.

Recommended."}
{"text":"The Chef and owner, Werner, is an excellent cook.  He was trained in Munich and replicates recipes using the true German hand.  I am used to German cooking, so I didn't think it was heavy at all. It was just right!

I ordered the homemade soup because the salad bar was very ordinary. Soup was excellent with a hearty broth and not too salty.  

The spaetzles were just like grandma used to make- without salt- so I added some. Red cabbage was delicious.  The entrees we had were roasted duck (moist and tasty), jaegerschnitzel (moist, delicious brown mushroom gravy flavored with bacon), wurst platter with German fried potatoes and Veal Wiener schnitzel served with spaetzle and green beans. We loved each dish.

The desserts were delicious! Fresh, warm, homemade apple strudel with vanilla ice cream was a huge surprise. It tasted like grandmas too!  I think it was the raisins and cinnamon.  My friends had Black Forest cake that was so chocolatey and fresh.

Our server was helpful, gregarious and attentive. Yay!

Unless this restaurant has a loyal clientele that supports it, I would suggest that the owner give at least the outside, a facelift.  It doesn't look nice. It looks like a bar and grill from the north side of Pittsburgh. It doesn't welcome you because of the total brown facade and dark colored windows.  The inside is dated too. If it has more of a German feel with German decor it would add to the ambiance."}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!! 

We have been driving by this place for years and finally decided to try it out. It was bluntly a WASTE of a date night. We arrived at 7:30pm, and after four different wait staff simply looked at us and kept going about whatever they were doing we decided to leave. As soon as we opened the door we were told a table was ready but the busboy. We should have kept walking out the door, but unfortunately decided to give the place a try even though we were never greeted. 

Once we were seated the waitress took our drink and appetizer order. The coffee was horrible, and the ice tea was flavorless even with lemon. The salad bar was pathetic and the soup was mediocre at best. We placed our order within ten minutes of being seated. Thirty minutes later the waitress came by to ask if we would like dessert. We hadn't even received our dinner yet and she was asking if we wanted dessert!! I told her this, and 15 minutes later we received our plates. By this time our frustration level with the experience was quite high, and we immediately asked for carry-out containers. 

The potatoes from dinner taste like boxed potatoes and not seasoned well. I ordered something with rolled beef with carrots and pickle in it. It could have tasted good if the meat wasn't dried out. 

I'm 3/4 German but didn't grow up eating German food, so it this is an Authentic German eating experience I am forever thankful for my American food upbringing.

This was an unpleasant experience on every level, although I will say our server was nice even if the service wasn't. The $55 bill was definitely a cruel joke for such tasteless, and crappy experience."}
{"text":"Came to a late lunch with wife & daughter. I started with their Goulash Soup, rich & extremely savory with a good amount of beef in it.  This along with bread & salad would serve as a meal.  Everyone enjoyed their taste. Accompanying ice teas were strong but very good.
We then received our entrees; myself the Herring Filet \"hausfrauenart\", wife the Jagerschnitzel, and daughter a noodle dish with sausage that I can't remember the name of.  My dish was beyond excellent; good amount of herring covered with a wonderful mayonnaise/sour cream sauce. Potatoes were firm but tender. Daughter's dish had very good flavor, but not much of a sauce, more like the water from the noodles not quite drained all of the way. Wife's Jagerschnitzel looked wonderful; good amount of pork and mushrooms, but upon closer inspection & taste we were sorely disappointed.  The sauce itself was thin & watery, with very little flavor other than the mushrooms. Not the rich, flavorful gravy we've come to know on Jagerschnitzels from other places. I understand that it is a popular dish with reviewers here; so either this was an off day or they need to try other places. The spaizles were excellent, although we thought it odd that the chef made them once or twice a week when they're usually made to order. Regardless of how they're made they are well worth trying.
Upon informing our server of our dissatisfaction with the Jagerschnitzel he informed us that the chef takes great pride in this dish & we would be getting neither a refund nor a substitution for it.  Really?? Maybe that's part of the Old World Charm. The wife was forced to order some Goulash Soup to have with her spaizles.
We each had dessert: daughter the cheesecake with raspberries, wife the ice cream with hot raspberries, & I opted for Palatschinken, their take on crepes.  Daughter thought the cheesecake very good, wife loved the ice cream & thought the raspberries tasted fresh.  My Palatschinken were very good, good-sized & stuffed with sweet cream & lingonberries.
Most of the food was between very good & excellent.  Service was a bit slow but the server was by himself & I felt he was doing his best; we didn't have to wait unduly long.
I had a hard time deciding how many stars to give.  I was sorely tempted to put 3 purely because of the customer service policies they have, but in the end I felt that would be an unfair reflection of the food. The chef has every right to disagree with the customer on the quality of his food, but in the end it's not about being \"right\", it's about trying to provide the best experience for the customer, and in this day & age that means substituting something, or a refund on what's not eaten, or even a free dessert. It's not as if we weren't spending a good amount of money there.
We will definitely go back at some point, but I think I'l insist on tasting anything I haven't had before investing in a non-refundable meal."}
{"text":"We want to try something different for a launch, with October Fest we went to Bavarian Point restaurant, in Mesa AZ.  When we walk in restaurant, restaurant look very old . I ordered 
fillet stroganoff ,with speatzle came with it, I expected real beef stroganoff that the beef is cooked in the sauce but that was just gravy cooked on the pan, the flavors wasn't near to what stroganoff should taste like.. Since we wore in German restaurant we want to try apple strudel, I know how proud Germans are from that apple strudel.. not this one, apples wore very brown cold in places because microwave did heat up properly and was drowned in vanilla sauce. Didn't look fresh at all , not the way apple strudel supposed look like. So instead walking from restaurant and have that yummy taste in mouth , we didn't . We are not going there again. Sorry Bavarian Point. We might try your neighbor for dinner.."}
{"text":"it's been years since i went, but it was really, really cool. the setting is exactly what you'd expect from an authentic German rest., it was dark with lots of wood, very old world style.
this was the first place i tried frog legs (isn't that a French thing?) but they have tons of great food."}
{"text":"The soup of the day was zucchini. Even though it was 103° outside, the ac was blaring inside and the soup was warm and filling. I had the Zwiebelrostbraten and it was absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked. It's a beef filet covered with deep fried onions and it came medium rare. The beer was typical, but ice cold so no complaints. Decor is old school and the water glasses were a little dirty, but it was cozy and homey!"}
{"text":"I love German food, and as far as the food went at Bavarian Point, they had some good eats. The *only* reason I'm giving the restaurant two stars instead of one is the food. Their rindsroulade was very good, and the red cabbage and spaetzle were excellent. But the quality of the food was undercut by the poor service. It was bad enough that I wouldn't return, and certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. As others have noted, there was no-one to greet or seat us -- not even a sign saying \"seat yourself\". Our waitress took a LONG time to make it to our table to take our drink orders, and when she did, she was complaining about something and looked put-out in general. When my wife ordered a beer, the waitress told her that it would be more expensive because it wasn't available on tap. Now, that could be useful information, but the manner in which she told my wife was defiant rather than helpful. Believe me, we gave her no reason to be so sour --  it was clear that this particular waitress was clearly unhappy -- whether with her job or life, it's hard to say. It's too bad, really, because the food *was* good. But why would anyone want to eat at a restaurant whose workers are either nowhere to be found, or miserable? Not me."}
{"text":"Did anyone read my post about the roaches in the kitchen...? WOW~~I will say it again, there ARE ROACHES IN THE KITCHEN. SICK!!!!"}
{"text":"We visited here for lunch and were somewhat disappointed.  My friend, a real German, ordered roulade, red cabbage and mashed potato.  The roulade was fine but it wasn't really hot.  The mashed potatoes were definitely from a box - not fresh.  The red cabbage was OKish but only lukewarm.

We probably would not return - would probably try Zur Kate, which is in the same strip center."}
{"text":"While I was in Mesa on a business trip, my hotel gave me a list of restaurants in the area. When I saw that there was a local German restaurant, I HAD to go (my dad is from Germany, and I loooove German food). This place is neat because when you walk in, you're standing in a hallway. If you go left, you end up in the restaurant, or if you go right, you're headed towards the bar. Either one worked for me, but I was hungry. 

You seat yourself here, so don't stand around and wait to be seated - you'll be standing there forever. When I chose my seat, I was greeted with a basket of warm (delicious) bread and a glass of water. Good start! I ended up ordering a bowl of soup and the salmon (way to go for authenticity, Nicole! Oops!). The soup was a celery soup with a creamy beef broth base. I've never had anything like it, but it was awesome! The salmon was to die for. I wish I could vouch for some of the more authentic German dishes, but I'm a seafood lover. Sorry!

Either way, I don't see how they could make *any* bad food. Everything I saw looked delicious, and my food was great.

**Update**
I went back in July (another business trip)... and had the salmon again. D'oh! I know, I know... sorry!! lol BUT!! I DID take an order of bratwurst and sauerkraut back to my hotel room with me to heat up later, and it was awesome! Soo good :D"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is old fashioned.  Service was very abrupt and to the point.  I really wish the menu gave a better description of what you were ordering.  We were told to help ourselves to the salad bar.  After peeking at the salad bar and having read yelp reviews I returned to the table and asked for soup instead.  I wasn't told what it was but was brought a tomato soup with rice.  It was greasy and delicious.  When I was about halfway done the waitress returned and asked if I wanted whip cream on it.  I did and she took it and returned with a healthy squeeze of unsweetened whip cream.  It was amazing with the other flavors!  Also, the bread with butter was really good.

For my meal I tried the pork scallops with mushroom sauce.  Not mentioned was how much bacon is also used in the gravy.  Unfortunately I don't eat bacon so I was bummed.  I ate it anyway.  The flavors were good and I would have loved it (I think) if I was a bacon eater.  Since I'm not I wished I had ordered something else.

The spaetzle came with it and it was very yummy.

For dessert I had the black forest cake.  It was the worst black forest cake I have ever had.  I would skip it next time for sure!"}
{"text":"The last time I was here, while the food was quite nice, and the waitress[an older lady in a German folk dress] was an utter angel, we came face to face[ snout?carcass], with a dead mouse caught in a mouse trap. I have read other reviews saying the same, so clearly they have a rodent problem.

I would -like- to come back, as I enjoyed their food immensely, and we often go to Zur Kate next door, but I'm terrified of mouse poo in my schnitzel!"}
{"text":"Those that love this type of heavy, savory and filling food would give it a most favorable review.  That being said I gotta go with 2 stars for being overpriced and not good.

Perhaps German food is an acquired taste but in my book it was not prepared with care and it showed.  Nobody in our party was happy with our choice of restaurants and for sure none of us will return.  Btw it is expensive and we had no drinks either.

The waitperson acted like she wanted us outta there."}
{"text":"This restaurant must be experienced in person to fully grasp the authenticity of Bavarian dinning, we attending a Birthday party here and it will go down as one of the most entertaining evenings of my life.  Good food too!"}
{"text":"I spent 6 years in Germany and my buddy who was with me Friday night is German.
We absolutely loved the food. I had the lamb shank with the jäger (mushroom) gravy with the fried potatoes and red cabbage. A little Asbach to wash it down. Delicious.
My buddy had the Bauernschmaus which he loved. Made him a little homesick. 
The owner, Werner came out and said Guten Aben to everyone and asked how the food was. Just, a great experience."}
{"text":"A great find for anyone looking to experience authentic German food. Everything has wonderful flavor, cooked perfectly, and any place that gives you endless baskets of warm, fresh bread is a friend of mine! 

We did come here at an awkward time, 4:30pm, so it was fairly empty. But once 5:30pm hit a steady stream of people began to flow and it took a while for us to get our check. Which is fine, they were in the middle of getting more servers and the busser lady was very prompt to step in when needed. 

Prices are moderate, around $15-$20 a plate but it comes with a lot of food. There's even an endless salad bar if you so choose instead of the house special soup. 

My family has loved this place since I was younger, and now my boyfriend agrees it's worth your money. If you want to try something new and are tired of the usual, Bavarian Point is a fantastic place!"}
{"text":"Zur Kate is real close, so yourself a huge favor and go there. Salad bar is gross, rotting vegetables with stems on them.  Watery gravy, very generic bland food.  It does have friendly service and lots of options so 2* but the food is bad for the price.  Jaegershnitzel at Zur Kate is $13 and comes with your choice of 2 sides.  It comes out and taste amazing.  Here it is nearly $17 with one side and is fatty and gross.  Plates were mostly dirty as well.  Bad experience, there will not be another for me."}
{"text":"I had the Tiroler Gröstl, a sampler of diced meats with German style potatoes. It was a tad salty for my usual taste, but overall very well prepared and seasoned. Service was very slow, and I had to wait much longer than usual for drink refills and general table service.  

Overall assessment: Good food, dated decor, and waitresses leave much to be desired when it comes to attentiveness.  I would go back and back and try something new, in hopes that the lacking service was due to an off night and not normal operations."}
{"text":"I can't believe the other reviews I have read, it's like I went to a completely different restaurant. Lets start from the beginning, as we walked into the restaurant I was greeted by our soon to be waitress smoking a cigarette two feet from the door. Appetizing. Then after being seated and getting some pretty tasty bread I went to the salad bar.  YIKES!  Can you say e-coli?  This also brings me to the word of the night was luke-warm.  This applied to my husbands beers, to the salad bar and to the food that took an hour to be served.  Did I mention that I was served the wrong food.  And not just a little wrong but completely a different dish.  After I recieved what I actually ordered I decided to stick with the bread.  The beef was a salt lick, and the dumpling was as solid as a brick.  This place was such a disappointment.  I felt sick after leaving and needless to say I will not be back."}
{"text":"The liver dumpling soup was EXCELLENT! I would go back again and again JUST for that. However, it is not routinely available. The chef decides when he is going to make it so it isn't on a schedule.

The iced tea was cloudy, murky and super strong as if it was old. The spaetzle was soggy and in big white clumps instead of delicate eggy puffs and was very bland. The Jagerschnitzel was dry and tough, giving the impression it was precooked and then resurrected.

I really wanted to love the food here, especially since it is in the same strip mall as Zur Kate whose food was cafeteria quality. Maybe I'll just go back for that soup!"}
{"text":"Was curious about this German restaurant after having a really good experience at the one next door. We were going to the other one but they weren't open yet so we figured it would be a good opportunity to try Bavarian Point. The atmosphere is very similar, a bit bigger and smells a bit like cigarette smoke. The cigarette odor wad the only negative thing. When we walked in at aprox 2pm, there was not a soul in the place except for us, the waitress, and the cooks in the kitchen. The quality of the food was very similar to the other one but it's hard to choose which one i like best. It's like choosing your favorite child."}
{"text":"Ok, my first visit here and my 1st visit to a German food restaurant in 30 years.  I gave it 3 stars basically due to the food getting all 3 stars.  It was great food. 
I had the pork chops with beans and potatoes. Hubby gad the 3 \"wurst\" plate with sauerkraut and potatoes.  Brother had jagerschnitzel..  all was excellent. The decor was dated and dark. The service was okay. It was 2 in the afternoon and only 1 other 4 person table in the whole place. A salad bar came with our meal. Not a very good one. Too American. Why not more german inspired foods.  Ummmm. Still good enough for a 2nd trip."}
{"text":"This was my first German food experience. I was hesitant at first, but after we went, I was impressed. I had the Fried cornish game hen and it was yum with a side of Spaetzle and I could have had a whole plate of that! I haven't gone back but I need to."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for mothers day. I had been craving sauerbrauten It was pretty good but not the best german restarant I have ever been to. My family is german/polish so I grew up eating really great german food probably the reason I am so picky. I ordered the Sauerbrauten it was good but not the same sourness I am used to. Also the dumplings were different then I was used to. I guess if I want it to taste like Grandpas I will have to keep making it myself. I know food to a certain extent is all about personal taste and the food was good just different than what I am used to is all.They give you good size portions so don't wear that form fitting outfit if you go.The beer I ordered was very good. I can't remember the name, the server suggested it. The only thing I would caution is if you have limited time you may want to go another day. They are definitely on the slower side at getting out your order.We almost missed our movie because of it. All in all I would go back. as making my grandpas recipes takes alllll day"}
{"text":"Wonderful lamb chops!!!!!   It's always difficult to find a good restaurant when traveling but we struck gold here. Great food and exceptional service."}
{"text":"This is a solid 4 stars when it comes to quality of meats served and food.  The salad bar is fun and unique. 
The service is slow but if you have Estee and you say hi. (Or the bar) your service is decent.  But seriously food is good. Big portions and top quality. 
Beef stroganoff, bauern dish and chicken curry dish is spot on. Also liter beers to match. Liters under ten bucks!!"}
{"text":"I'll make this simple. Not worth the money. As a 20+yr flight attendant I have eaten at many restaurants around the world. If you are a connoisseur of international fare then you will be sadly disappointed here. My boyfriend had the Veal Cordon Bleu. I had a sample of it. A 13 year old could have made it. A piece of pounded veal with swiss cheese and ham folded over and breaded. Then deep fried or pan fried. Bland. No spices. Blah. I had the stroganoff. The beef was dry. The side of mixed vegetables tasted of freezer burn. The waitress took our order. Delivered our drinks. Brought our meals and refilled drinks. Then never came back to check on us. We were finished for about 10 minutes before she came back to our table. We each ate approximately 3 or 4 bites  of our food. Our plates were still full. She asked if we needed \"to go\" boxes. We said no. You would think a waitress would then question us about the meal for feedback. Not her. She came back with our check about 5 minutes later. Lastly, the  salad bar is nothing to write home about. There is a german restaurant off of Indian School in Phoenix that does circles around this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on a Saturday for lunch. It was fairly slow. I grew up in Germany and while I realize nothing compares to home cooked German food or the food back in Bavaria, I'm always willing to try German restaurants to see how they are.  

Pros: decent service (it was slow though, so I don't know how it gets when it is busy), good beer (even though they can't spell the name of it in their menu - sigh!), big menu selection and good portion sizes.  Oh and I liked the sauerkraut. The best part of the meal was the bread which was more of a French bread than anything German. 

Cons: my husband had a schnitzel and I had the Bauernschmaus. Somehow all 4 types of meat were very tough. The potatoes seemed to be instant potatoes or at least tasted like it. The dumpling was really dense and kind of tough. The broth for my liver dumpling soup was lukewarm at best but at least the dumpling was warm. Overall everything just seemed to be very bland and lacked flavor. 

Next time we'll be heading to the other German place again that's just a few doors down. The selection there may be smaller but the quality of the food seems much better."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here for a long time. If you are craving German food, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I go here once a year for a friend's birthday dinner (his chosen tradition). The food is very good with authentic choices for those actual Germans who accompany us on this pilgrimage. The service is friendly and attentive if a little unpredictable (you never know what type of beer the waitress who has apparently worked there for 25 years will bring you - ha!). Definitely worth a visit if you are in this area. The pepper steak with spaetzle is really delicious."}
{"text":"We ate at the Tavern, the bar connected to this restaurant and it was great! Had the steak sandwich and the Jaguersnitzel, both good. Place was empty besides us, waitress was friendly as well."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving three stars is because the cook did not fill our special requests Yes the server did have it written on the order ticket .  The lamb shank was beyond perfect, but instead of the Spätzle substitution we requested, we received the fried potatoes  .  Oh and don't bother with the strudel, the dough in the Center was way to thick and wet and doughy. Yuk! The Palatschinken was marvelous! Our server who was working alone was cheerful and attentive and extremely apologetic for the cooks' mistake.  She showed us the order ticket and she had it written up correctly . While we were there she took care of a group of thirty people plus four other tables by herself .I wish I'd remember her name so I could thank her publicly ."}
{"text":"We went there on New Years Eve and while the atmosphere was pleasant the sticker shock on the menu wasn't!  We endured because it was a special occasion, but overall found the food to be of average fare; certainly nothing noteworthy.

The wait staff however was very attentive and pleasant which did some to overcome the general experience.  

Overall, when looking for authentic German food, music and atmosphere at prices that are reasonable, there are other options available.  I really wish I could be kinder, but the tab versus the quality just doesn't make that possible.  Save your money."}
{"text":"Food is old fashioned German fare at old fashioned prices.  No where for them to seat someone in a wheelchair.  They couldn't even accommodate my walker.  I was very uncomfortable.  The food was exactly what you think a German mother would make.  
If you like my reviews follow me on yelp."}
{"text":"We sort of stumbled upon it  today and decided to have lunch.  We were in between lunch and dinner so it we were the only ones on the restaurant side and did things get fun. 

The waitress gave us a quick break down on some dishes we weren't familiar with, but in the end we kept it simple. My daughter went with the house made brats and fries and was not disappointed. The flavor and texture of the brats were spot on perfection. (I will get them next time for sure)

I went with the pork Wienerschnitzel and German Potato Salad with a side of Kraut. A+, 2 thumbs up, 4 Silver spoons, etc.

The Apple Struedel sat in a bowl of fresh warm custard, very warm so more of a sauce, not a solid jiggly custard.  

Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, I've had German food in Germany and this place is really close.  I had the jagerscnitzel and it is pretty tasty.  The lingonberry crepes are really good, they are huge, could be a meal.  Nice selection of German beers and German wine.  The lettuce on the salad bar is lacking, but the rest was good.  The place is overall clean looking but don't look up.  The amount of cobwebs on the chandeliers and cords was grossing me out, also, please wash the walls by the booths."}
{"text":"A friend enlightened me to this place on Memorial Day.  They were open...so that was a good start.  I'm a sucker for good German food (but quick to be annoyed by German slop claiming to be good food).  

The Goodness:  They were open on Memorial Day, that's a good start.  $5.50 0.5liter beers is another good starting point (I got a tasty hefeweizen myself).  We both had one of their off menu specials, the Lamb Loin.  It came out green beans that were mixed up and cooked with bacon and fried up and potatoes that appear to have been fried up in Parmesan cheese or something.  They were all sitting in this tasty dark liquidy gravy next to this perfectly cooked and seasoned lamb loin. The lamb loin did require a knife to cut it up...but it was still very tender.  Tender and tasty.  I can't quite describe what it tasted like.  It is kind of like a good roast, but better.  

The Meh/Bad:  While the barkeep/waitress was nice enough....we were pretty much the only people sitting at the bar.  Having to wait about 10 minutes before seeing anyone was kind of blah.  Add to that when my friend asks the lady if they have any \"lunch specials\" she rattles off their list of \"specialties\" (off-menu \"specialties\").  We were unaware that we had this much of a misunderstanding...until the bill came...then we were keenly aware.  Not sure anything \"on-menu\" was that expensive.  It cost each of us $30 for the meal and a beer ($5.50 for a half liter of good German beer is pretty good though).  

Conclusion:  This place is worth the visit.  Authentic and good German food.  You do have to suffer the service though....which maybe our experience was unusual...but it really could've been a lot better."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try Bavarian Point and finally did tonight; the other German restaurant in that same complex was closed for the holidays. 

It was an awful experience! Not only was the food bad and overpriced, the service was terrible. Our server was slow-moving and rude.

When we walked in, there was a sign that stated, \"Please wait to be seated.\" We stood there for two minutes, but no one came. We decided to seat ourselves and there was still no service! After waiting for a while, the busser finally brought us waters and silverware. The server decided to make an appearance and take our order before giving us menus. When I asked for menus, she responded, \"Oh...she didn't bring you menus? Isn't that funny?\" and stared at me awkwardly for a good five seconds. It really wasn't funny. She then got the busser's attention and glared at her for not bringing us menus. I couldn't help but think, \"Well....can you bring us some menus now????\" After some time of staring and glaring, she went to get us menus. Of course, we wouldn't see her for a while after that. 

After getting our menus and figuring out what to order, I kept trying to get her attention. When she finally saw my hand go up, she said in a rude tone \"I'll be back. I need two seconds. JUST TWO SECONDS, OKAY?\" and went back into the kitchen. She came back five minutes later and instead of asking, \"What would you like to order?\", she asked \"Are you in a hurry or something?\" After I responded, \"I'm just really hungry.\", she said, \"well, we're very busy tonight.\" (There were about five tables seated at the time and the restaurant was clearly NOT busy.) 

When I asked for the salad bar option to go with my dinner, she commented, \"well that'll be good, since you're very hungry.\" If I wasn't with my coworker, I would've walked out.

As for the food, the schnitzel I ordered had a weird rubbery texture and was not breaded(!?!!) The mashed potatoes tasted like it came from a box. 

The whole meal was disappointing. I definitely will not be back!"}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC!   The food is truly top of the line.  My favorite German dish, the sausage sampler, is done better here than at any other German restaurant I have been to in the U.S., and I have been to a handful, and always order the same thing(s).  The salad bar is exceptional  as well.  It always has some of the best potato and macaroni salad around in addition to fresh fruit and a variety of salad ingredients and dressings."}
{"text":"I was there at 7 on a Thursday night... service was terrible, food was over-salted and awful, not much for decor/ambience.  How can a place be out of iced tea and make sauerkraut unrecognizable??  I spent time in Bavaria and the food is nothing like authentic German food."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place with my mom over the years so the nostalgia factor is what gave it 2 stars. However, it really only warrants one. The last time we went was so dismal that I vowed never to enter this ghost town of a restaurant. Literally, there was no one eating there but our party. It was as if we rented the place out. The service was slow and since we were there was no one else but us, that is pretty unexplainable."}
{"text":"I was disappointed that the Jaegar schnitzel  was not breaded. I have travelled across Germany and America and this is the only time I didn't get a breaded pork tenderloin. It's not a Schnitzel without the breaking . Everything else was great. Just not happy about the chef and his idea of a schnitzel. The staff was amazing and the salad bar fresh"}
{"text":"I like German food and the greater Phoenix area offers several choices. One thing led to another and we ended up at the Bavarian Point in Mesa. When I go to a restaurant, I don't rate them by the outside view the tables offer. I rate them by the quality , authenticity, taste, and freshness of their food. The Cordon Bleu was fantastic. One of my guests ordered the Beef Stroganoff. Let me mention that my guests had never had German food in their lives! Every dish served was superb. 5-star rating... and the salad bar was good. Yes, I would have liked the restaurant to have a different decor, maybe different seating arrangements, or seats or chairs or tables.. but you know what? I am there to have quality German food ! And that's what we were served! Plus the draft beer, a stout amber was phenomenal... I highly recommend this restaurant. This was my fifth visit. I thought they deserved a 5 star write up!"}
{"text":"This place has been open for at 20+ years.  Our dinner crew, opted for this to try German food.  We all basically ordered 5 different entrees and tried each other's.  Everything was well seasoned and cooked.  The entrees we ordered included an option for the salad bar, which had a nice selection.  The place is a nice medium sized place with a bar and I believe more restaurant space next door.  It had an old world decor with wood paneled walls.  Our server (Stacey) was very nice and accommodating.  Between her and the helper, we never went thirsty.  Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Tonight we had dinner for 4 at the Bavarian Point Restaurant. This is one of those classic Mesa strip mall restaurants that almost every non-chain restaurant is forced to be located in. The strip mall is pretty weak, plus the fact that the strip mall is located in eastern Mesa / Apache Junction, which makes it a little rough to look at to start with. 

The insides are definitely old. This place surely caters to the elderly patrons that live in the area. The chairs are wobbly and the vinyl of the booths if fading and cracked. The lights are from the 60, or 70's at best, but I'm not sure if that's just because the place is old, or because it's some sort of German theme. 

The menu is a little pricier than expected: about $15 - $20 for most entrées. We asked the waitress to recommend something. She spouted off about 10 things, but everything was in German and we still had no idea what to order. When she came back for our order we just pointed at our dishes and hoped for the best. 

I ordered the Weinerschnizel, which I don't think I've ever had. It wasn't at all what I expected. I was thinking it was some type of sausage / bratwurst type dish. The dish came with what they called fries, but they were basically baked potato chips, but they were quite good. The weinerschnizel was pretty good too. I ordered the veal version, as opposed to the pork. 

My brother ordered a sausage dish which was fantastic. 3 large sausages, pork, beef, and veal. We weren't sure which one was which, but I'm pretty sure I really liked the pork and beef sausages, but the veal one was a little dry. 

My sister-in-law ordered a walnut crusted chicken dish. She is prenant so she ended up drenching it with lemon juice to bring out the flavor so by the time I tried it, it was a little hard to swallow. 

My wife ordered a great beef dish that was very, very moist. It came with the same delicious 'fries' that came with my dish, as well as a red cabbage Sauerkraut which was decent, but had a minor beet flavor to it. It came with crisp onions and was fantastic.

Overall we enjoyed the food, but it was a little pricey and I'm not sure we will make it back soon, but it was worth a shot."}
{"text":"My family goes here for any special occasion and especially when my grandfather visits from Utah (he was born and raised in Germany). This is the only German restaurant he will eat at in the Mesa area because of the authentic atmosphere (it is old, but very German) and the autherntic food. Family favorites are Weiner schnitzel, Jaeger Schniztel, Roladen, Bratwurst Plate, Sauerbraten, Goulasche Soup, Pancake soup, and Apple Rings. I highly recommend this!"}
{"text":"Upgrading them to 5 stars.  Aesthetics greatly improved since our last visit, new lamps, cleaner appearance, customer service top-notch.  PLEASE give them a try!"}
{"text":"Rating is based on one weekend lunch.  The place was mostly empty.  There was a sign that told customers to seat themselves.  
There was a pleasant friendly waitress.  Leek soup was hearty and flavorful.  Warm crispy white baguette straight out of the oven. Wienerschnitzel with Bratkartoffel was good, not great, and was huge.  Sauerbraten was decent.  Booth seating available, comfortable.  Scenes from Germany on the walls.  Music varied from German pop to nondescript American.
Would try them again if in the area, perhaps the traditional Herring and dill offering with boiled potatoes."}
{"text":"When I walked in and saw the salad bar, I was thinking to myself that it was just a salad bar. When I actually got to the salad bar and saw their selections, it was interesting to see all different types of salad. Then when  I started to eat the various types of salad I had on my plate, it was amazingly unique and delicious. I had some kinds of pickling green beans, beets, Brussels sprouts, carrot, and coleslaw. 

Then we got two desserts, crepe (Palatschinken) and fried apple in vanilla sauce (Geb Applerings). The crepe was tasty with the berry cream. The vanilla sauce was great and complement the fried apple."}
{"text":"Having lived in Germany for 7 years, this is one of the few places where I have found good German food in the US. I would rate it 5 stars, but they really could improve on the service."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon between the Lunch/Dinner rush and were the only people in there for a little bit. We've been to Germany several times, and the food matched what we had there. Very nice service, and we loved the German Music playing, added a nice touch. The salad bar! OMG! You get the salad bar or the soup of the day with an entrée, and we chose the salad bar. I was thinking, ok, it's full of the usual greens, but I'm not a big soup eater. The salad bar had tons of items, your usual stuff, but some added German salads as well. You must try them!  We were too full for dessert, but next time we'll go for coffee and cake."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Germany on traditional German food (very traditional, I just say head cheese, blood sausage, kraut and dumplings) I can just say: go to Bavarian Point. My fiance, born and raised in the US, went there before and was very satisfied so I wanted to try although I usually don't eat my home country's food when I'm in another country but rather whatever this country has to offer. It was worth the exception! The interior might seem outdated and too rustic but that is how German restaurants look like, not kidding. It's considered to have a charming traditional vibe. Bayern 3 radio station was playing, that is the only complain I have - German Schlager and folk music... :D
We decided on the salad bar for appetizer and it was simply amazing. Lots of different salads to choose from and all I sampled were delicious! We then feasted on fried camembert (not really German but my fiance wanted to try), lamb shank with green beans and roasted potatoes, and sauerbraten with bread dumpling and red cabbage. Every bite was a real treat. Yes, German food doesn't look appealing most of the time, it is heavy, often overcooked, and doesn't feature fresh fancy colors (my fiance says every dish is brown and yellow in Germany. I disagree. We also have dark green beans and deep purple cabbage...), but that's how it is and has always been and that's how we love it. The taste makes up for the look! We couldn't fit in a dessert because the portions are huge. Will try to squeeze one in next time. 
The service was German... Less attentive than the typical American service with \"everything okay?\" every two minutes, but friendly and quick. 
I can definitely recommend this restaurant if you want authentic German food in an authentic looking German restaurant!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at 12:30 hoping for no lunch rush....
no worries.    Four tables full and a sign to seat yourself, so we did.   My 93 yr old mother and I had lived in Germany and wanted to treat my wife.   At 93 with a walker she was faster than the service.  We rambled in, sat down, waited...waited....waited.   Finally decided to leave, we have been ignored in better places.never a hello or good bye.....so we went to the Iowa cafe for a pork tenderloin instead.  

Last best of Phx award was 1999...must be a reason.  The Iowa cafe was great"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here tonight. We walked in and stood there alone for about 5 minutes before another couple came in behind us. A server came up a couple minutes later and asked each of us how many people we had. The people behind us said that they had made a reservation so they were taken back first. We were sat in the back corner and service was a bit slow (minus the woman who gave us and refilled our waters, she was on top of things). Our beer and soup surprisingly came out quickly and was good. Our food took a very long time and was only warm. My fillet was the fattiest filet I have ever had. Potatoes were good. Green beans were pretty good. I thought it was a bit pricey considering that it wasn't amazing."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I never thought pickled herring would be something I loved but it was a beautiful combination of flavors. We also had the camambert with lingon berries. But the star of the show was my beef burgundy with spaetzel! The meat melted in my mouth. It was so tender and and the sauce was beautiful. The spaetzel was cooked perfectly. The service wasn't great,  kind of short with my mother in law, and pushy. She actually complained to us about other people's reviews when she saw me taking a picture for this. It was weird. But for the food I would go back."}
{"text":"WOW......AMAZING!!!!

Started off with the liver dumpling soup....Fantastic! Not a strong liver flavor like one might think.  Perfectly warm and flavored nicely. Even if you don't like liver you would like this soup.
App was the braut skewer with kraut.  Also fantastic.  

Next was jagerwurst....WOW so very delicious.  The spaten was so good it melted in your mouth.  And finally Wurst fpanne which was 3 different sausages, sauerkraut and potatoes.  The sauerkraut was so good it melted in your mouth.

After talking to the waitress she explained that everything was made from scratch except the polish sausage which was the only thing that didn't grab my attention.

This was the best German meal I have ever had.  So glad I found this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant as a party of 9 on a Saturday evening. Upon arrival, a busser tried to seat us, and had a problem understanding that we were a party of 9 apparently due to a language barrier, but it was quickly straightened out and we were seated in short order.

Warm bread with real salt butter was quickly brought to the table for our enjoyment. None of us wanted an appetizer, though they have a very nice list of them, and 8 of us opted for the salad bar, while one opted for soup. The salad bar was small but nicely laid out. I must say that I had the best beets of my life there, and another of our party said she had the most wonderful green beans she had ever eaten. Kudos for the nice start to our meal!

Our waitress came back to the table to tell us about the evening's specials. 3 of us ordered the Pork Osso Bucco from the special menu. Others ordered Jagerschnitzel, Weinerschnitzel, and one ordered a plate of scallops. A few of the items on the menu were not in keeping with German/Bavarian food, but it was all quite tasty.

All portions were big; big enough to satisfy the biggest appetite! The Osso Bucco was cooked to perfection, falling off the bone tender, and with a terrific, silky smooth sauce from the cooking with mushrooms in it.

All the schnitzels were properly pounded out thin, and just about completely covered the plates. The only word for them is huge. Companions all pronounced them to be excellent. The companion that ordered the scallops pronounced them to be perfect. 

Most of our party took home a doggy bag, though I seriously doubt any of the dogs would get a bite of this hearty food. Dessert was unanimously Apple Strudel. It was different than any apple strudel I have ever eaten, and was not the highlight of the meal, though the sauce it was swimming it was heavenly. I probably could have ordered and drank an entire cup of the sauce!

Other reviewers have mentioned slow service in their reviews, but we found the pace of service to be just right. A constant stream of guests were seated while we were there and it did not seem to have an effect on the service.
The place was clean, and the only dings were that the ladies room needs to be spiffed up a bit, and the A/C needs to be turned down a degree or two.

If you like hearty portions of German/Bavarian food I commend this place to you."}
{"text":"I visited on New Year's Day hoping to find the traditional sauerkraut and sausage my parents used to make to start the new year. I did check out the Yelp reviews first and noted two restaurants in the same parking lot. I had a coupon for the other one, but discovered it was closed. The read the reviews for Bavarian Point and initially was hesitant. The overall star rating was slightly above average, but upon further review most of the very good reviews were old. The reviews from the past two years were poor-low, but I risked it and went inside. 

One of the negative comments from other reviews stated the service was slow. It took a lot of time to be greeted and there wasn't a sign saying \"please seat yourself\". Both of these appear to have been addressed as there was a sign, I picked a table, and was immediately helped by what I presumed was the owner. It wasn't very busy when I arrived - only one table of three older ladies. As I stayed for my meal a few more small groups arrived.

I ordered the Wurst Pfanne - which was exactly what I was looking for (only more of it): polish sausage, Bratwurst, and Weisswurst served with sauerkraut and fried potatoes. The meal also came with my choice of salad bar or noodle & vegetable soup. I went with the soup and ordered a Spatan Dunkel to wash it all down.  The soup arrived quickly as did a free order of bread. 

When the food arrived it was a large portion, garnished with Alf alpha sprouts, tomato, and a side of spicy mustard. For $15.95 it was more than I would typically spend on a lunch, but there was plenty of food to bring home. The beer was $5 and even though I didn't eat half of my meal I went for dessert too (another $5.50). They have apple strudel, but I went with cake. German chocolate is my favorite, but the server talked me into Black Forest. She said she liked German chocolate, but after having Black Forest she hasn't returned. This was good, but afterwards I would probably stick with German chocolate. 

Overall the experience was good - the service was efficient, there restaurant had a nice appearance, and the food was excellent. I would probably give it another try."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that hasn't changed in 40 years. That can be good or bad. There is a tradition that is appreciated and fun, but it feels old and worn. The traditional German dinners were good and definitely satisfied our cravings for some German fare. Service was so-so. They filled our water glasses when we arrived and that was it. We had beers, but sat drinkless most of the evening after that. We might go back, but then again, we may just try the one next door when the cravings arise again."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, atmosphere and service. Been here multiple times and have never had a dish we didn't enjoy. As for service things can get a little crazy so you may have to wait a little bit but to get the fresh food and cold drinks it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place for my brother and I to celebrate our birthdays together!  Since we called around 8:30pm saying there would be 10 in our party, they set up a table for us in the bar which allowed us to stay later and order many beers and shots.  My wurst and brats and potatoes were tasty and the shrimp and other dishes looked great.  Our friend spoke fluent German with the chef...  I played a couple of songs on the piano...  A lot of laughter and a night to remember, but the bottom line:  it's really good food."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced and not too authentic like others near by. It'll do the trick to cure that schnitzel craving but not at the top of my list."}
{"text":"August 2017- Sunday late afternoon
Definitely not worth the price for what they serve. Cost $51+, for 2 (2 pop drinks incl).
- salad bad was pathetic- canned pineapple, frozen brussel sprouts, greens were old.
- ordered the veal schnitzel ($18.95 each) but got pork ($4 less in price). 
Wienerschnitzel
Served with German fries. ( it was soggy )
VEAL - $18.95
PORK - $14.95

My husband has been in the food business for over 40years, he knows the difference between pork and veal. 
-Husband said the Men's bathroom was dirty with a filthy towel hanging for wiping hands. Circle K/ QT bathrooms are cleaner than this place."}
{"text":"Sad when a restaurant goes from a 5 star to a one star all due to a bad server!  Don't know her name, she never introduced herself. Bad attitude, no smile, push back on any menu alteration or request on the verge of rudeness. No refilling drinks...and the list goes on. 
My family has been visiting this restaurant for the past nine years, love the food. About three months ago we had taken a larger group of friends 10, our first encounter with Frau Bruja. Due to the nine years of good food and service, we decided to give it another chance.  This time we decided to celebrate Father's Day at the restaurant. We had reservations for 2 pm and again it was 10 of us, we were seated in the small dining room, very very hot in there. To our disappointment our server was the nasty waitress. Long story short, we will not return to Bavarian Point. Can't believe this establishment pays someone money to be rude and kill business for them."}
{"text":"Went here for a celebration dinner with my fiancee tonight. She ordered the sausage I had the Jagerschnitzel. Food was fresh and amazing and they had very personable service. I like the old fashioned feel to the restaurant. The black forest cake was really good and I enjoyed the German beer selection they had. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Been driving past for 20 plus years and never tried it! I grew up in Michigan and know good Bavarian  food. The service was awesome  and the place has a cozy decor and atmosphere. Selection was diverse and interesting  on the menu and the food was fantastic! The deserts are huge as are the portions!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Bean soup very flavorful, jaegerschnitzel tasty.  Small restaurant with only two waitresses, but i dont think the kitchen could keep up with anything more as everything seems to be made to order.  If they are busy expect to wait at least 20 minutes for your meal."}
{"text":"Bavarian Point is a decent German and Austrian food restaurant.  

We started with the breaded Frog Legs.  They were good but needed more spice. 

I had a liter of beer and the Saurbraten and my girlfriend had a wine and a pork Schnitzel.  Both had outstanding flavor, but were overcooked.  The salad bar was run of the Mill, but a couple of decent items found.  The Red Cabbage was good too.  This was an average meal at a great price.  Best prices at a place dedicated to German food that I have seen."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed German food at Zur Kate several times and decided to give Bavarian Point a try since it was in the same strip mall.   We should have taken the clue that there was a long line at Zur Kate and many empty tables at Bavarian Point.

Once we ordered, It took a very long time for the food to come out.  The potato soup did not have any discernible potato in it.  The salad bar was was ordinary, like I would expect at a diner.   The sauerkraut was delicious and I enjoyed the German potato salad.  The rest of the food was just ok.   The decor is dated and looked more like an old 70s parlor than a German restaurant.  Several times during our wait for food, a heavy cigarette smoke smell would come into the dining area.  

Overall, I would recommend the other German restaurant in the same plaza."}
{"text":"The place is old school all the way, as are most of the customers (snowbirds) and staff. I know that some of the people there must have worked there for 20 or 30 years or so and they really need to move on or only try and help fewer tables since they can't keep up.  The service is ultra slow unless you get one of the younger (under 60) waitresses.  I could tell the young waitress and a hispanic girl that was bussing were doing there best to help as many people as possible to make up for what the older guy and women couldn't handle.  The salad bar could use some fixing up, it's on par with a college dormirtory salad bar. The entree's and dessert were top notch though. Very well done and delicious.  Beer selection was also old school German but fit the restaurant theme perfectly."}
{"text":"The osso bucco was off the hook good.  Just really a perfectly tender and flavorful piece of meat.  

My kids loved the brats (although they said they like Zur Kate's more).  

The stroganoff was ok.  Not savory enough.

The space is a little worn.

Very friendly service and they let my kids have the salad bar for free!"}
{"text":"The service is friendly and the food is pretty good; it's not Onkel Bruno's back in Ulm though. For German it's really the only game in town, I don't like the neighbor/competition Zur Kate. We like that the chef will pan fry the spätzle for us, which is how my wife's family grew up eating it.

The bier list is good and they sell drafts in full Maß (1-Liter) which I like. But watch out when ordering the 1L beer; on two different occasions the waitress brought out the 500mL. When I pointed out that I ordered the 1L, she said \"we can bring you another, it's the same\". When the bill came, both times I was charged for two 500mL instead of the less expensive 1L. I don't like that sort of issue, and the fact that it happened more than once makes it feel deceptive rather than accidental."}
{"text":"This is probably actually a 3 1/2 star review, but I'm throwing in the extra half-star because this is actual German cuisine, and that is increasingly rare. Some of the food is prepared with a heavy hand (i.e., a bit overcooked, flavors not as bright and distinctive as one would like) and the portions can be a bit overwhelming. Nevertheless, our large group of family and friends that tried this place for the first time walked away (or I should say, waddled) quite satisfied.

Highlights: Good beer selection, friendly staff, extensive menu with the emphasis on meat and pork, stick-to-your-ribs German comfort food, gemütlichkeit (ambience).

Lowlights: A long wait to be seated, even though seating was available and I had called well in advance to put in a reservation.

I just had to try the Gulaschsuppe (Hungarian gulash soup) because I have such found memories of it from Germany. It was a meal in itself and had much more stew meat than I was expecting. It did deliver on flavor, however, with just enough paprika-forward peppery goodness. Best to share this if you are saving room for an entree.

For my entree, I had the Bauernschmaus ($17.95): combination of pork roast, roulade and smoked pork served with sauerkraut, dumpling and mashed potatoes. This seemed like the best \"sampler platter\" to satisfy my desire to try an array of flavors. The roulade is \"beef roll\", or a thin cut of beef stuffed with pickles, onion and bacon. The pork roast and smoked pork were a bit overcooked, but I realize this is how pork is traditionally cooked (unlike nowadays, where trichonosis is not an issue, so you can actually serve it a bit rarer). The sauerkraut and mashed potatoes were just o.k. This was a monstrous plate of food, most of it meat!

Others at the table weighed in with satisfied yummy sounds upon digging into their tasty meals. These included the Wurst Peanne ($13.95): polish sausage, bratwurst, knackwurst served in a pan with sauerkraut and fried potatoes; and the Forsterkotelett ($15.95): sauteed pork chops covered with portobellos and mushrooms, served with herb potatoes, bacon (green) beans and applesauce. Although the schnitzel (breaded pork cutlet) covered half a plate, it looked a little less crispy than what I would have preferred.

All in all, you get a solid German meal experience here. If I had come with fewer people, I would have shared more and maybe ordered fewer entrees (since many can feed two). But mom was throwing down the plastic and it had been a while since I overindulged, so we all let our German appetites run wild.

If you can only eat one meal today, you will be über-satisfied with a meal from Bavarian Point. Prost!"}

{"text":"So lets start off by saying I had been here previously and always had good experiences. That being said I haven't been here in over 2 years or so and I usually eat at the bar. This trip we walked in noticing that the building was missing parts of its roof. Not the restaurants problem but it was a sign. we walked in noticing it was somewhat busy and there was a sign that said \"seat yourself (another bad sign sign). So we found a table and were greeted by a busgirl help that spoke no English but neither did she speak German. At this point we were brought stemmed water glasses. I tried to get a child friendly cup for my 4yo to no avail. I then noticed high chairs blocking the fire exit. I went over and found a booster chair amongst a pile of broken chairs. And then we sat for an eternity without bread watching the very old waitress walk around talking to patrons and from time to time taking orders all while the Latina helper woman argued with and glared at her while trying to figure out what was going wrong at each table. After assuring my Girlfriend that the food was phenomenal and worth the wait the bartender from the adjoining bar finally came and took our order. We went to the Salad bar which was nice and adequately stocked but I was sad to see that the salad dressings were all the traditional American fare i.e. Italian, ranch, French etc. the kids ate salad to abate their hunger while we continued to wait for our food. My girlfriend went a found a Styrofoam soup cup for my 4yo water. Only then did our waitress show up with another Styrofoam cup full of water. But still no bread basket. My 9yo ordered the Jaeger Schnitzel with Spaetzle, My 11yo & I had the Sauer Bratten with dumplings and red kraut, My 4yo had breaded chicken and fries, and My Girlfriend ordered the Chicken in Apple schnapps sauce with fries. I also ordered a side of jaeger sauce and spaetzli. finally my Girlfriend asked the other non English speaking Latina for some bread. after we had forgotten what we even ordered our food finally arrived. By then a customers had given up and left without their food. I also ordered a small warsteiner beer. My beer  arrived while I was in the restroom. when I came out I saw that the beer was only 2/3rds full. I accused her of drinking it but my 11yo dutifully notified me that the missing beer had been occupied by foam. Out dinner was phenomenal. the kids being very skeptical and wary of new foods, really enjoyed their dishes as did I. my girlfriend pointed out that she had gotten spaetzli instead of fries. then the waitress remembered I had ordered a side of spaetzle & Jaeger sauce. She brought that out midway thru the dinner. The bill was $93 for 2 adults and 3 kids. I left a 13% tip due to the piss poor service. The server came and looked at the check/tip before the plates had even been cleaned off the table. She gave my GF and I a questioning look as If she was surprised that I wasn't very forgiving of her weak performance. The food was very good but overall the dinner was ruined by poor service and detreating surroundings. I won't recommend it to anybody or take anybody there again but I might sneak in for a lunch if I'm by myself and the clientele is light. I was very embarrassed after building Bavarian point up to my Girlfriend and the kids. This place has some of the best German food around but it needs a makeover from Chef Ramsey."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. The duck and the lamb were cooked well and the portion sizes were huge. The place itself seemed a little dingy though."}
{"text":"The service here is usually very slow but the great food makes up for it.  Avoid the salad bar as it is nothing special. Pretty much anything on the menu is fantastic and worth the poor service."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight. Not impressed from entering front door which was dusty & dirty. Whole place was dingy. Don't recommend the special Osso Bucco which was not done properly, dry & tough. My mom had Rouladen which was also dry & leathery, inedible. Dad had special Pork Shank which was pretty good. Spent 100 total bill with 3 glasses of wine. Totally not worth it.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Possibly the most underrated cuisine out there, German food is full flavored, and Bavarian does not disappoint.  3 friends and I went for dinner on a Thursday.  At 6:30 there was plenty of seating room, the place was clean and the service was prompt.  We got 1 lamb shank, 1 pork shank and sausage platter with 3 different sausages.  Everything was really good, I liked the lamb shank the best.  Although I was only able to eat half of my meal, the german potatoes (much better than the mashed potatoes) went great with a couple eggs the next morning, and the remainder of the shank and sauerkraut  will be gone tonight!  I will be back to try the goulash.  If it's as good as everything else, I'll be bumping them up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Bavarian Point has very good German food, but is a heck of a drive to get to. I also made the pilgrimage for a friends Birthday. 

I stuck with what I know: Brats and Saurkraut. The Saurkraut was delicious. The Brats were pretty good, although I think that they gave me a sausage mixture. 

Different friends ordered different plates, so I got to see a little of everything that was ordered. 

Helpings are generous, Décor is dated, menu is solid German, and salad bar is questionable (is it German? or just a salad bar?)..."}
{"text":"Had a great time here with a big party. They gad great food and beer. There was a guy playing the accordion and lots of folks singing in German at the bar. We had a total blast!"}
{"text":"Bavarian point is amazing. Have been there many times over the years and it never disappoints. Jagerschnitzel, rindsfilet madagascar, the wurst pfanne, leg of lamb, etc are all 5 stars. Get the soup instead of salad bar.. always worth it."}
{"text":"I would give the food 4-5 stars, the restaurant and service 2 stars.

The food was super yummy - my Gram, a German foodie was super satisfied.  The 

When we arrived for lunch at the restaurant, we waited for about 10 minutes before we were seated (there was only was other customer at the restaurant when we arrived).  We were told to pick our table and once we did we noticed how dirty the place was.  There was a layer of dust on all of the lamp shades, a layer a grime on the walls, oil stains on the table cloth and a flat out used/dirty plate with butter and crumbs on it.  Later, when my 5yo daughter dropped her napkin under the table - she went down to get it and came out with another dirty napkin and some empty wrappers from crackers."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for something different while still getting a good beer this is definitely the place to go. Various beer options and you can even get them by the liter.
The place was crowned today and it took a little bit of time to get our food, drinks and a table but overall it was worth the wait.
We sat at the bar area and our server was friendly and tried to check on us when she could. 
We will be returning to try additional beers and menu items, hopefully the waiting will be less than today."}
{"text":"This food was delicious. Everything was homemade and flavorful. My only criticism is the rug needs shampooing. People nice, prices reasonable and the Apple Strudel is excellent!!"}
{"text":"Authentic German food!  This a great great find, authentic food and a great atmosphere.  This is like a small restaurant you would find in Europe.  Great German beer selection as well.  Place has been there over 35+ years so you know it's good.  Check it out."}
{"text":"4 adults. Food was just ok. Nothing more.  
The atmosphere was boring. Quiet. Dark. I wish they had played German music to give it a better atmosphere as expected.   We had to ask for a 4th plate and silverware for appetizers and also catsup several times. 
Even though we had three different waitress coming back to the table, no one could remember to help us with that. When we went to order dessert, the waitress bragged on the apple streusel so we ordered it, only to hear five minutes later that they were out of it.  Not somewhere I will return to a second time. Mostly it was just the service wasn't up to par.  Again the food was ok. Not great but ok."}
{"text":"My wife and I do not normally eat German food.  We do however go once in a while.  We went to this restaurant recently and found it be quite interesting.

Yes, the decor is very \"dated\" or very traditional.  It is in need of a facelift.  However, the food, even though my wife and I do not normally eat German food, was very good.  

I ordered the Filetgoulash Stroganoff.  My wife ordered Jagerschnitzel.  Both were very good.  They were quite heavy, as we are used to eating more Asian style food, but the food was good.  

The German food here reminded me of something that I ate for lunch while transiting through Munich on my way to Firenze.  If the food were \"lighter\" I would go back.  Right now, though the food was good and tasty, my wife and I still find German food to be a bit heavy."}
{"text":"I took my parents to Bavarian Point on word of mouth. I should have used YELP!   I am sad to report that this was the worst experience I've ever had. From the moment we walked in - there was a lack of attention. I honestly thought it was a seat yourself type of place, because there was NO ONE, NO ONE in the front to great you. Now, I've never been to a German restaurant and it can be a bit overwhelming. I don't know what the hell to order! It made it worse that the menu was in German, I get that I am in a German place, but last I knew - we aren't taught German in school and when the person came around to take our order, I swear it was at least 30 min. Terrible!  While we were waiting for our mystery food my mom found a baby roach on the table! She trapped it under her water glass that was empty, due to lack of service - but THAT WAS IT!  We walked out - we had to... 

All I can say is Good Luck to you if you eat there! May there not be any roaches in your food or table!

PROST!"}
{"text":"Great German Food & excellent friendly service. Will recommend this restaurant to anyone look for delicious authentic German cuisine."}
{"text":"I took my husband who is German to enjoy an authentic German meal for his birthday. We had been to the Bavarian Point a few times over the years. The food was never great, but it was close to German. My husband ordered Schweinebraten, a classic Bavarian dish. I ordered a Wiener Schnitzel. When the Schweinebraten arrived it was clearly not even close to the meal ordered. It looked like very thin Pork Chops. Without tasting them, they looked dried out and stale. Regardless, he took a bite and immediately spit it out. I tasted my Schnitzel. It was OK, but certainly not a meal any average cook would serve. My husband said, just forget it we are leaving. He handed his credit card to the waitress. She took it with the comment \"was the food OK\". My husband said, \"it is terrible\". She walked away, without further comment, came back with the check for all items served. We started a pleasant conversation with the customer next to us, who observed, \"having spent years in Germany that is no Schweinebraten\". Our conversation was enjoyable, so we stayed another half hour. The disgusting meals stayed in front of us, apparently the waitress had no intention to remove them. The owner/cook came out to chat with some friends, but did not find it necessary to address the issue with us. Clearly, because he knew what he served us. The word \"disgusting\" does not get close to what was served to us. We certainly will not return, but undoubtedly the owner does not expect us to. Only a miracle or a cook will save this place."}
{"text":"This is our favorite German restaurant.  The food is so genuine.  The quality is exceptional.  Love the schnitzel."}
{"text":"I must agree with many of the previous comments. I was raised in Europe so I'm very familiar with German food ....this restaurant would never make it in Germany. Every meal we had at our table and it was very dry, overcooked and not tasty at all , the dumplings were not completely cooked the mashed potatoes tasted like out of the box. The decor is german, if you go to typical German restaurants, if looks like this, it's not a hipster restaurant and I didn't expect it to be. The bread was frozen bread, the soup tasted like out of a can. I can personally cook a German meal 10 fold better than they did. Even if it had been good, it was way overpriced. Sorry, Ill never go back, recommend you try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very quaint & older place. Friendly staff and many menu options of German fare.  Wine & beer list has good selection.  Went with my Uncle, who is from Germany, and he loves the Wiener schnitzel -says they make the best around. Rindrolude (?) was quite flavorful but a little salty.  Jäger schnitzel was ok-not as flavorful as it could have been. Had a pale German beer but don't remember name-was very good. This place is Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Decent German food with very friendly and efficient service.The food is good (decent) and there are loads of options - everything from traditional German food to lamb shanks and game hens. I felt the food was overly salted, but loved that every single dish had a different side item. Loved the potato dumpling and the green beans and roasted potatoes. The spaetzle was dry and needed some gravy or sauce - and the Jaegerschnitzel was not in the usual breaded style. Just different IMHO. I probably wouldn't go back, as there are other choices in the area for better German-style food. Just me."}
{"text":"I've been going here for quite a while, somehow I think this place is going down hill quick.

Salad bar as always was kind of odd looking.  As always it was somewhere between mediocre and average. 

I had the sausage plate.  Sausage good, potatoes good, red cabbage good.

Wife had jager schnitzel (or however it's spelled).  Schnitzel was as tough as leather.  Sauce and mushrooms were good however.  Spatzel...well it was spatzel.

We ordered desert...apple strudel.  Bleh!  In the past it was pretty good.  This time almost on the edge of not worth eating.

A couple of other points...

- Some one mentioned the ratty ceiling tile.  It's still there

- I've noticed it before and just thought it was a one off thing...but for some reason they like to leave a vacuum cleaner in the dining room

- There's like two german restaurants on the east side of the valley...and they're both in the same parking lot.  How did that happen?

To be sure this place is in decline, maybe I need to go across the parking lot next time."}
{"text":"Needs to be remodel and thoroughly clean. The owner/cook, needs to quick smoking with no gloves while he is cooking.
I don't like this place at all."}
{"text":"You don't come here for the service, you come here for the food. My favorite German dinner is weinerschnitzel with spaetzle and mushroom sauce. I've eaten this dish at least 20 times in Germany; this place gets it right every time. My husband's mother is full German and this is her go to spot when she wants German without having to cook herself. Naturally, we've been coming here for years. Esther, who is the 80 year old mentioned in all the comments just retired. Hopefully the service will be a little more upbeat now. The cook, Verner, will do special orders if you ask. If you're not in a rush and want good German food then this is your spot."}
