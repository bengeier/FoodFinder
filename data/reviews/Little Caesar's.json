{"text":"This place is terribly slow. There is never anything ready in their hot n ready zone. I come because it's supposed to be convenient but it's not convenient to wait 15 min for a cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Convenient location but very rude staff!!! U will get ignored for the first 15 seconds you're there so the girls can finish giggling with the boys in the back!!! Won't be coming here again!!!"}
{"text":"Little Caesars deserves more than five star considering the quality/service for only $5"}
{"text":"One of my staples. I no longer get asked for my ID when using my credit card...very bad sign. Just can't beat the hot and ready deal and crazy bread! I may get my pizza here all the time, but the price is pretty close the quality. However, totally worth it in a pinch."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this location to open because it is so close and convenient to my neighborhood. Our family has pizza night every week and every time I go in to order the hot n ready cheese & pepperoni, I have to wait. I have never been able to walk in and out with the pizza like I could at the location on Gilbert & 202 or McQueen and Riggs.   Usually when I pick up, it is around 4:30-5:00 and there are no customers so I'm not sure why they do not have the pizza ready.   I continued to order pizza there and just called it in so the pizza would be ready when I arrived and hoping the service would be better and faster. Unfortunately, after several months, they have not made any improvements."}
{"text":"I've always loved Little Caesars because of the instant gratification and decent food. At this location, the staff is super friendly and accommodating! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up dinner for the fam. Little girl running register was in terrible mood. I've been here before and had younger staff provide nothing but amazing customer service. But man her tone, eye contact and body expression said it all. C'mon, I know the pizza is cheap and not the greatest... but her piss poor attitude put a poor taste in my mouth before even eating. Hopefully they keep her in the back making pizzas instead of disrespecting paying customers."}
{"text":"I grew up eating Little C pizza and this location has definitely changed the recipe. The pizza was hot and ready and very fresh but it IS NOT THE SAME PIZZA as the little Ceasers chain recipe. I can totally tell the difference. I hate when franchise owners do this. The location was convienent but I will go elsewhere in town for the real flavor."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and $5 large pizzas make this Little Caesar's Pizza a good choice for a quick weeknight meal.    Just like most Little Caesar's locations, the heart of this business is their $5 carry-out deal.  You can expect a bit of a line during the dinner rush, but it usually moves quite quickly.    You can't beat the value here.  They have got a good thing going, and I doubt it will change any time soon."}
{"text":"The look I got when I asked if the customers is always right ...I got no This place is exactly what is wrong with the country as a customer wanting to pay for something they standby their corporate structure and unavailability to think outside the box they are perfect robots."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars because they deliver exactly what I expect from a Little Caesars. The location is clean, the staff is usually young, so not top notch service, but they get the job done and it's nice to see kids working!  I have never received a raw pizza or otherwise from here.   Good pizza that makes me nostalgic for the pizza parties I had as a kid.   Cheap reliable meal."}
{"text":"Great price for very decent pizzas!! But this five-star belongs to the service! I came by to pick up my Pepperoni order and I was happy and beyond satisfied with the service here! Friendly, Considerate and Quick! I hope that the manager would recognize the girl who worked there for her amazing performance, she'd done really well :) It was around 9:30 p.m on Wednesday 06/28. Much love."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice and both times I've had to wait for $5 \"Hot 'n Ready\" pizzas to be made. The Little Caesar's business model is based on having pizzas \"Hot 'n Ready\". It shouldn't be that hard to make enough pizzas to fill the warmers and then make a new pizza every time someone orders one. If I'm going to wait for a pizza to be made, I'll just go across the street and get one from Dominos.  I agree with the previous review that said having only $8 \"Hot 'n Ready\" pizzas ready must be a sales technique at this location. If that is true, this location won't be here long."}
{"text":"Deep dish three meat pizza and cheesey Italian bread! Our favorite walk out pizza  made fresh for us everytime."}
{"text":"This location is hot and miss. Sometimes they know what they are doing sometimes there is entirely a new staff who does not know a thing. Waits for me have ranged from 5 mins to 45 mins for a \"Hot-N-Ready.\" like all locations soda is over priced, and the pie is Little Caesars quality."}
{"text":"I'm not a lover of pizza, and you've got to be able to carry out, because there is no seating!   The $5.00 One topping pizza deal is awesome!!!! The pepperoni is always ready!   The quality of the Pizza is good. Better than higher priced competitors, that deliver.  The ingredients are cheap, to keep the price down.  Customer Service needs improvement. They make you feel like they want to get rid of you.  For the price, I'd go back. Not for quality, or customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 meat pizza. Tastes okay. But the chicken wings are way too small, just like pigeon wings..."}
{"text":"I give this location a 2 star. The customer service I would give 5. Those ladies work so hard and deal with rude customers every time I go here. However, it gets SO BUSY EVERY SINGLE TIME and there's just not enough room to fit everyone that's waiting. And the ones that come to pick up should have their own sideline."}
{"text":"This place shat the bed hard today. First off, our order was incorrect when we got home. I ordered one pepperoni and one supreme minus the onions. When we got home, the supreme had onions and no mushrooms. The pepperoni pizza had nearly all the pepperoni on one side. It took 20 minutes when they said it would take 10. I feel even worse for the lady who was there prior to us and 25 other customers who came and still was waiting when we left. She asked for her money back and they were rude as can be and shut her down. Multiple other people than learned to check their pizza before leaving and 3 other people had to bring theirs back and get the correct order."}
{"text":"I agree with Charee W. It's a $5 pizza. And I love them. Always a friendly person working there, even when their swamped. If you're not happy with a good tasting pizza for $5 bucks with mostly friendly people, I certainly would not want to be the one that has to serve you anywhere. :)"}
{"text":"Little Caesers has surprised me by staying open this long, I ordered a cheese pizza from here and buffalo wings.... The wings were a $1 more than the pizza, however they were just ok, nothing interesting. And the pizza was doughy still like it should have been put through one more time in the oven. But for $5 you can't go wrong if you just are real hungry and want pizza."}
{"text":"It's only 5 - 9 bucks but some of these snooty Chandler girls seriously need client service training. Not hungry anymore."}
{"text":"I arrived at 9:40 and ordered my large cheese pizza. Seemed great. Service.  Everything. Got my pizza about 9:55 and too it home. They close at 10:00. Anyway, I wondered why all the slices \"stuck\" together when we tried to get our slices. The entire center (about 5 inches diameter) was NOT COOKED. Cold. Dough gooey. Grossed out. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Came in with my good friend after a day at the pool. Wanted some good food fast and cheap. We were on our way at 9:40 and wanted to make sure it was open- closing time is at 10 o'clock. Gave them a call and they politely answered and told us coming in close to closing time would be no problem. Once at the location around 9:50 they promptly served us and had no problem making us some fresh, hot pizzas so close to closing time.They were so kinda and our pizza came out great. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but service is awful. Called ahead for a hot and ready. Was told it would be ready when I got there. When I arrived I had to wait almost 10 minutes. Won't be going back to this spot"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 party packs for a bday party. Easy to order and only $50 - plenty of food & drink (4 pizzas, 1 order of crazy bread, 1 2 liter of soda - per \"pack\"). We ordered the day before and everything was ready when we requested it to be.    Only downside, no help to your car. I went by myself and had to take a few trips. No big deal for me but if someone needs assistance they might not get it.  Oh, their phones were extremely crackly - hard to hear the employee but could understand enough that our order was correct."}
{"text":"I mean how can you not LOVE a five dollar pizza pie.. And wings are not bad either the fact that you don't have to wait either makes it a plus ;) all in all if your in a hurry and have some valet money stop by and get you some"}
{"text":"For a cheap on the go food they have something always ready. I'm also very pleased to see that they have deep dish pizza pepperoni on the hot n ready option."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick meal, the cashier was nice & their service was quick. No complaints, guess other reviewers just catch them at the wrong time and are just super picky, I mean your paying for cheap meal so why expect TOP NOTCH service? They're decent and quick & honestly I wouldn't expect more out of them! Visit this location, better than the one on Rainbow!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I actually live by the Rainbow location. We've ordered food there & their service was AWFUL. We wanted to try this location hoping it was a different story.  We walked in at 10:45PM, Ross (the assistant manager) took our order, he was quick, accurate & polite (I truly appreciated his helpful attitude). We food was COOKED TO ORDER. One pepperoni pizza with light sauce, the other cheese with light sauce, an order of crazy bread. The food was delicious & I couldn't of asked for better service. I will be back to this location soon."}
{"text":"One of my grandchildren does not like cheese or pepperoni because he's is a vegan my granddaughter loves cheese and pepperoni so when I call them they were able to make A double up on one side put pepperoni and cheese on the other side have not been for it but yes they were able to accommodate me and Were able to accommodate my needs so I just wanted to say  thank you so much for being there for me"}
{"text":"My experience with this restaurant was horrible. The staff are rude and the pizza taste like a card board box. I'm never coming here again."}
{"text":"Meh. It's \"okay\" at best. We have visited this location about 6x and I'm pretty sure it's a sales \"technique\" to only have the $8 pizzas ready. There are Never any $5 \"hot n ready\" actually ready. It would make total sense for them to have only the $8 ones ready because no one wants to wait $15 minutes for a $5 cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Little Caesar's may not be the best pizza in town, but it's delicious. If you want a good pizza without paying two to three times the price it can't be beat. Like with all locations if it's busy you might need to wait for your pizza. Otherwise it's usually in and out in a minute."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever gotten a cold pizza from Little Caesars they're always ready to go when you walked in the door and they're always good for the price you can't beat it that's why I give it a 5-star rating it's clean the people are friendly and they understand exactly what you want on your pizza and I'll make it anywhere you want sometimes you might have to wait but normally you don't and for the money it's well worth the trip"}
{"text":"Raw pizza crust. Ordered the deep dish with the cheese bread for $9. Could not rat the pizza most of the crust was raw nor even cook. Will not order any deeps dish from them again. Plus the deep dish covered in sauce. Who the hell makes this crap there. BEWARE of RAW DEEP DISH PIZZAS.. The cheese bread was good....They need to fire whoever made and cooked this piece of crap pizza"}
{"text":"For $6- the new most cheesy pepperoni was pretty good!! Very filling! Today they were crazy busy & I waited 25 mins! It's right around the corner from my house so I'm sure we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Just want to give this location some credit for a well run lc, l have had many pep hot and ready most from here. This store is very consistent on the pies for the most part. They also most the time have ready or 5 min wait for fresh. Staff is always going to be young but they are friendly. I have been to other locations around town and have got some really under or over cooked ones."}
{"text":"Friendly staff... I ordered 9 pizzas and was told it would take 10 minutes. Pizzas were done on time. They were hot and fresh...no complaints and all pieces were eaten. I would order again from them."}
{"text":"Got hungry for a quick pizza so stopped by right at 5:00 and figured it'd be really busy.  I got in and out quickly.  Haven't had Little Caesar's in years, but was pleasantly surprised.  Got the Hot 'N Ready pepperoni pizza and it was pretty darn good, especially for 6 bucks.  Won't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Never tried Little Caesar's before but the pretzel crust pizza intrigued me.  I went in around 9:30 and waited 5-10 minutes for a fresh six dollar pizza. It was very good. The \"pretzel crust\" was just normal crust with salt sprinkled on it but it was still tasty.  The place was clean and the staff was extremely friendly and courteous. The food is cheap and delicious. I will be back."}
{"text":"This Little Caesar's is located in a small shopping plaza off of Fort Apache in from of an apartment complex. This located is more updated than any other Little Caesar's and it is nice and clean.   When I walked in I was greeted with a hello but it seemed as if I was rushed to place my order and I had little to no time to look at the menu. Even though I knew what I wanted, but I could have changed my mind if I would have had a little more time to look over the digital boards.  Once I placed my order of the Italian Garlic bread, the young women informed me that it would take tens minutes and pointed to the card reader for me to pay. Before my payment was processed she was in the back and I had to reach behind the counter to get my receipt because she was nowhere to be found.I then sat down and wait for my food and within no time my hot cheesy Italian garlic bread was ready.   If I am truly craving cheesy garlic bread again then I may return to this location but the customer service was horrible. The food was delicious which it always is whenever it is cooked fresh."}
{"text":"Not bad for $5 pizza. In fact I've tasted worse for twice the price. I haven't tried he rest of their menu, so I tried ordering chicken wangs once since I was craving some. The wangs are too small and there was too much sauce. Service can be a hit or miss. Hot n Ready can be pipping hot and fresh, or been out for a while, so yeah a bit inconsistent also. But for the most part, whenever I am in need of a pizza fixin' I stop by here and get two large cheese on the go."}
{"text":"Where else can you feed 2-3 people for $5?? i personally am not a HUGE fan of their pizza, but I am a huge deal of something being hot and ready for me to put in my mouth when I am in a rush.   I did have a slightly annoying thing happen during my most recent trip. I went in to pick up a cheese pizza so I grabbed only my debit card and walked into the car. I was told she HAD to have my ID in order to swipe my card. My card is signed on the back and its a FIVE DOLLAR transaction. I realize id theft is real... but I think I would be balling slightly harder than a $5 pizza if I were going to steal someones card. Rather than argue, I just ran back out to my car and grabbed my ID. I was pressed for time, so I found this kind of annoying.   I wanted to try the pretzel crust, but they only make those after 4pm, I will have to go back and try that another time :)  Overall an enjoyable pizza. :)"}
{"text":"The pizza is not the best but edible if you are hungry and broke.  This location is in my Entertainment Book and I have the mobile App.  I bought a regular pizza and a deep dish and they would not honor the coupon on the mobile app.  The manager said he needed a printed copy.  He looked at my phone and said that was not the coupon. I told him that we have to click where it says \"redeem coupon now\" to get the coupon on the next page but he would not honor it.  It was for free breadsticks. He was not nice and he was WRONG. Oh yeah, He charged me $8 plus tax for the deep dish and I got home and saw on TV they are selling it right now for $7. The coupon got me in the door and I bought 2 pizzas but they refused the valid coupon. I'd only go back again if I were desperate."}
{"text":"I love the 3 meat pizza and combo sticks!!! So delicious! You get more than you paid for"}
{"text":"Never was a big fan of Little Caesars Pizza, last time I went to one was over 10 years ago in California BUT with that being said I was in the area running errands getting hungry & decided to clear out my change purse. It was actually decent! You cant beat the price $8 bucks Large Pan Pizza! I was in & out under 5 minutes, so I was stoked about that. Have leftovers & empty change purse lol..I'll go back once in a blue moon :-)"}
{"text":"I've purchased pizza from here more times than I care to admit. $5 for a large pizza is not a bad deal and pretty hard to pass up after a long day when you're too tired to cook. The pizza is fine. Certainly not the best pizza ever, but for $5 you can't really expect too much. We've never had to wait very long to get our food, even on Friday nights when it seems to be busiest. If we are ever worried about waiting, we call in the order. When my husband gets the pizza and brings our 3-year-old son in, the workers there often give our son free cookies. He definitely enjoys it (who doesn't like free cookies?).   Overall, it's cheap food, but it's decent cheap food."}
{"text":"I always suggest calling ahead. There was a line when I got there and I was the only one to call ahead. My pizza was ready within 10 minutes. We had the deep dish cheese and pepperoni stuffed crust pizza. Always yummy!"}
{"text":"Thank you to the staff for still having pizza available at 5 min till close and serving us with a smile!"}
{"text":"I suggest you hire people who understand you on the phone and get the job done properly. They say the coupon for a free Hot-N-Ready pizza works in any location and they say the opposite when we get there. So we have to go to another one now."}
{"text":"I usually ignore the bad customer service here, pizza is cheap and fast. I called and made a specific order which I had to repeat 3 separate times because the lady taking my order just wasn't listening. I got my food home and it was cold and completely wrong. So I called back to get it handled and once again had to repeat my order 3 separate times. I talked to manager, Erica, who thought interrupting me mid sentence was how to handle things. She had said my food was ready. I got there not even 5 minutes later and had to wait for them to re make my order. I get that it's busy, but if you mess up someone's order, and make them drive all the way back just to wait again, decent customer service is expected at the least."}
{"text":"Forgot these guys. Corporate BS. The girl on the phone didnt tell me the price over the phone so i made the trip thinking im paying under nine dollars for my pizza and its 7-8 dollars extra for veggies. I don't think so! And then the non helpful manager without a nametag said im basically screwed."}
{"text":"Not a very good Little Caesar's experience. I phoned the order in and got there to discover they'd made the wrong pizza. They remake our pizza, no discount of any kind for my wait, and it barely has any toppings on it. Not very happy with our experience."}
{"text":"Its ok looks clean I got pizza there few times it was fast and good enough for the price you paying . Not to busy  much better then rest of them I think ."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Little Caesars in general. I like the Detroit style pizza, I love the prices, and I prefer to pickup my pizza myself without paying a tip to the delivery driver.  The Hot-N-Ready idea is great. No need to wait because they will stockpile a bunch of cheese and pepperoni pizzas in anticipation of the peak hour.  The location that is closest to me (Rhodes Ranch Town Center) doesn't understand the concept and guaranteed, you will be waiting 10min+ so I have have stopped going there and will only come here now even though it is a few miles farther away.  Occasionally you still have to wait here, but they make up for it by ALWAYS having excellent customer service and ALWAYS having the cookies for the kids. I have never had any problem with the quality of pizza at this location."}
