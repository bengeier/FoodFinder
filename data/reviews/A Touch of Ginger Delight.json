{"text":"A big fan and repeat customer of this restaurant. As good a Vietnamese restaurant as you can find. Friendly and efficient staff and great food."}
{"text":"I had many of there dishes, and most are ok, but lacks flavor. The best item on their menu is the Saigon Beef Tartar salad, which i crave and dream about! The flavor is intense and just parties in your mouth! I can eat more then one plate of that. I highly recommend the Saigon Beef Tartar. It's under salad/app."}
{"text":"No frills here. Pho is top notch. Prices are easy on my wallet. Service is almost non-existent. I visit almost weekly in the winter and recommend it for a quick bite at lunch."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 Service: 1/5 Ambiance: 2/5 Overall experience: 3/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  If it hadn't been for a gift certificate I got for here, I would have never stopped by since there are hundreds of other Viet restaurants in the city. We went in the late afternoon on a weekend so it was really dead with us being the only customers.   I know Asian service usually sucks, but it has never sucked this bad. The only waitress there spent 80% of the time in the kitchen so our water glasses were never refilled and she never bothered to ask if we needed anything else once the food arrived. What also peeved me off was that since we sat next to the kitchen, all we could hear was the staff yelling random gibberish (probably gossip) in Vietnamese. Pretty rude if you ask me....  They have a pretty big menu consisting of traditional Vietnamese food with a small Thai section. Prices are about the same as most Vietnamese restaurants. My bf and I ordered their 'Shredded Pork Salad Rolls' (2 for ~$4); and a 'Salad' ($4) appetizer with bean sprouts, shredded lettuce, and shrimp. Both appetizers were disappointing. The salad rolls were tiny and loosely wrapped so everything fell out after the first bite. The salad appetizer was terrible - the portion was small and it was drenched in this weird vinegary dressing.   On the bright side, my bf ordered a large bowl of 'Pho' (~$8.50) which was delicious! The broth was flavoured well with a tasty skim of beef fat on the top, and the portion of noodles and meat were decent. One of the better phos I've had in Calgary.   I had their Thai \"Chicken Lemongrass\" (~$11) which is enough for 2 people to share. There was a large portion of sliced chicken breast saut√©ed with bell peppers and celery in a chili pepper sauce. I asked for spicy, but got mild and the lemongrass flavour was very subtle. I was expecting heavier spices and flavour for a Thai dish.  Overall, the food wasn't great except for the Pho. If I didn't have a gift certificate, I would have left disappointed and regretting ever going there."}
{"text":"I have visited and had over 100 diff Viet noodles houses in Vancouver, Vietnam, and elsewhere.  This one tops the list of being bad.  Soup was  watery and flavorless, the T44 soup was a joke as they simply added a Chinese chilli sauce into the regular pho soup.  It contains rare beef and one slice of cooked beef, which is completely diff than other places.  Garnish only have green spouts and no basil leaves.  Black pepper bottle was emptied and had to pull the one used in the kitchen.  Service is fine, just the food were quite bad.   The only reason we visited this page out because it closed at 10pm instead of 9pm elsewhere."}
