{"text":"This is a really good place to hang out with friends on like a weekend or something.  Its got nice decor, comfortable seating and a nice washroom.  Theres a wide variety of food and drinks to choose from.  The food and drinks are good, but its really pricey. A large slush is about $8 - $9 -_- like wtf. The service is poor at times, but overall a decent place to chill with friends."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but it's continually gone downhill.  I'm here at 2am on a long weekend and they don't have any food or juice. (Wtf). They only have power bbt and slushie (powder again). I wanted the aloe and apple juice - to beautify as the drink intended for ... :(   Their very mango slushie isn't what it once was. They use to give star mango jelly but now it's just the regular ugly ones. At least they give real mango chunks still.  Their hotpot use to be so good but I don't know about it anymore (I couldn't order it!)  Anyhow. It's a typical Chinese establishment.   Hope this helps! -jT"}
{"text":"The only time I come here is when it's late and I can't think of anything else to do with friends. They are open late and good for big or small groups of people. Expect at least a 20min wait if coming on the weekends.   Service: The service has gotten significantly better from about 5 years ago. Staff are quick if you can ever get a hold of them (which can be problematic sometimes). Drinks come out fast too. You don't feel pressured to leave asap which is nice when catching up with old friends.   Drinks: Last time I got the black sesame cold tea which was good enough, not the greatest but sufficed. My friend got the milk tea with tapioca. The milk tea was too sweet and light on the tea flavour but the tapioca was cooked well.   Food: I don't normally order food but the menu has gotten bigger and almost all the tables ordered multiple dishes. Maybe next time I'll try..  Atmosphere: I like the high ceilings and decorative lights. The people that come here can get a bit loud though. They have free wifi so people tend to watch shows/movies at their tables.. Nothing you can do about that. :/"}
{"text":"I'd recommend this place to anyone that's looking for a cozy environment to have a drink, snack or hang out with friends. This place holds one of the best atmospheres to enjoy bubble tea or Taiwanese foods. The ambience has a very Asian contemporary design to it where it attracts mostly young adults and couples so definitely not a family type restaurant. They have a large selection of foods, drinks and desserts so you can choose to have a whole meal or just drink and chill with friends. I had such a difficult time choosing what I really wanted from the vast menu because honestly.....I wanted everything! After 10 minutes of reading the whole menu, I finally decided to go with the Popcorn Chicken to start (nothing too special, I'm pretty sure KFC did it better), Fried Rice with Taiwanese Sausages as my main (too much oil was used but it was ok, not bad) and an Almond Milk/Green Tea (a heavenly drink! The star of the night!). The prices are slightly on the expensive side but I guess in a way, it worth it once in a while to get together with friends. This place also includes free wi-fi but there are no outlets available along with magazines and cards."}
{"text":"When ever I feel like getting bubble tea this is the first place I'd think of going. By far my favourite. I like the decor and the bubbles, and the flavours are just sooo good. =D. Its a vary nice place to just chill and have a drink with friends."}
{"text":"The décor here is very trendy... maybe a little intimidatingly so, but I suppose it suits their customer base and (very high) price point? The atmosphere is a dark ambiance with some pretty gorgeous lighting and very private booths/rooms. the whole place is very well arranged, well-maintained and very clean. A big selection of trendy magazine is also available for perusal.  Unfortunately, the drinks were only mediocre for me. The fruity flavours were too overwhelmingly sweet, and the milk tea was not very smooth. I suppose they really aren't *bad* bad, but it just seemed like a bit of a let down in the context of the high price and general classiness of the place.  The one cake (mango and chocolate) I tried was quite delicious, though.  It is mandatory for everyone at the table to order at least one thing."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service. We got to the place at 3pm, confirmed that Lunch Special was still available, ordered but we got charged for the Dinner price. The reason they provided - the order was punched in 3:03 (though they flip-flopped between today being considered a holiday and it being punched in after 3pm). When we asked if there was a manager we can speak to, the answer was no of course and the waitress simply walked away and left us hanging.  I would rank this place 1 out of 10 to be honest."}
{"text":"Really only good for their bubble tea and crème brûlée, and if you're desperate to go somewhere after midnight. My friend ordered tea and it was super salty, even after she added lots of sugar."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I am in the area, because I can usually expect the food to be good, and I can also get bubble tea and certain authentic dishes that are hard to come by. However, the service always leaves so much to be desired. It's as if the servers are bored by you, or as if you're inconveniencing them by asking questions or making requests."}
{"text":"This is one of my default places to go to in Markham.  For me it's really a place to go to chat with friends and the drinks/foods is secondary. Decor is nice (they still have their Christmas decorations are still up - yes to Christmas time all year round!) and they have a large selection of drinks.  Of all their drinks, I think their Very Mango Mango slush is their freshest one - it comes with mango chunks and star shaped jellies. How fun! My friend had a mango shaved ice that also has condensed milk poured over it - it was pretty good! I expected it to be really sweet but it was just right.   My friend reserved a table for us and was advised of a $6.99/person minimum but we weren't held to this (apparently they were at the Midland location). We left around 11:30pm and the line up was long (as usual) so if you don't want to wait you can always go to Destiny's on the other side of Hwy 7 or west to Ten Ren's."}
{"text":"A really good restaurant. It has traditional Chinese food. Beef and fish taste really good! I love it! My friends love this restaurant also. You can find good dinner in Go For Tea! I won't forget this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Open everyday till the late night, I consider you and your friends should come here if your a bubble tea fanatic. I absolutely adore the drink i had which was Passion Fruit green tea with tapioca but I should've gotten with aloe! but no regrets the bubble tea was great.. it is a bit pricey than other places but it was worth every cent of it! :)"}
{"text":"I really like there BBT here. Totally worth coming from downtown, to sit and chill with your friends.. Creme brulee is always a hit with my friends and I. Fried rice is good, their food is nothing fancy but if you like homestyle Chinese food its decent. My favorite BBT is Passion fruit, Taro and Very Mango Mango. Service is decent at any Asian place I always expect alright service it doesn't bother me."}
{"text":"Rude customer service. Didn't get greeted to sit down. Server got our order wrong. But the chicken fried rice is good"}
{"text":"I've been a returning customer ever since they opened years ago. I like their atmosphere and the quality of their drinks and food, and the service is usually quite pleasant as well.   However, the one thing that really made Go For Tea stand out from the rest was the big slices of thick, chunky sweet potato fries that they served. Pricey for a snack, but nowhere else did I find such deliciousness lightly deep-fried to perfection. When I made the trip there yesterday to satisfy my sweet potato fries craving, I was so, so disappointed to find that they had stopped serving their signature sweet potato fries and started serving the ordinary skinny sweet potato fries that they serve pretty much everywhere else. Less flavourful, less chunky, and less delicious. Sorry to say, but now there's not much more reason to come here than any other bubble tea place."}
{"text":"I paid $5 for the worst coffee I've had in my 33 years. Don't order the coffee."}
{"text":"I usually come here if I'm feeling lazy or can't think of anywhere else to go. The food offered here is sub par but the atmosphere is very relaxing. The wide range of cold and hot drinks is amazing, but sometimes overwhelming as well.  Overall if you're looking for somewhere quiet to study, read a book, or just hang in the midland and mcniccol area, go for tea is great. The complimentary WiFi is also great!"}
{"text":"I have been on a mission trying out different bubble milk tea places  and have to say this one was disappointing and way over-priced at $6.54 (incl. tax).  Bubbles were over-cooked (too soft, I prefer al dente) and the milk tea tasted watered down).  There are way better options around, so most likely will not return."}
{"text":"What a rip off. Over priced drinks and not even all that good. Beautifully decorated but the food and drinks are way overpriced. $7-8 for a bowl of shaved ice with some fruit on it? A bunch of us ordered 3 of them to share along with some drinks. It cost just as much as a meal."}
{"text":"Poor service. They forced us to sit at a table that we didn't like and wouldn't allow us to sit where we wanted, claiming that the table was reserved. When asked further, they said the table was reserved for 6pm, but we were there at 4:45pm! Then the waitress said they usually keep the table empty an hour before the reservation. Then a line started to form at the entrance. We left but was curious if they would give the table to others. We went back and surely, the table was seated. My husband went and asked the guests if they were told to leave by six, but they said \"no\". He talked to the waitress again and she was still saying that she told the guests to leave by six. So they treated guests unfairly with ridiculous excuses. We used to go there often, but stopped for a long time after their wifi was broken. We've decided not to go back any more. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Went to this place today. Dark, yet ambient and cozy interior. Food isn't cheap here, but they have a variety of Chinese food here. This place is particularly big on bubble tea and tapioca drinks alike (not cheap unlike Tim Hortons), so I'd recommend this place for tea fans who want an exotic taste in tea and beverages. Waiters were attentive. And washroom looked hype but open and somewhat co-ed."}
{"text":"This location is a lot darker than the Thornhill location and the decor is very different (it's more sleek and lounge-y). The menu is exactly the same and the service... exactly the same too haha.  The service here is ok.. one cannot have high expectations when you're in a Chinese bubble tea place. The servers really only know enough English to take your orders. (Note, make sure you speak slowly and are really clear when ordering, like point to the actual item you want or else they will take your order down wrong.... actually no they, they will get it wrong anyways)  Honestly, I'm not really fazed by the bad service and the over-priced drinks, it's really the good times I've had with my friends that make it worth it for me. You can pretty much stay here are long as you want without getting kicked out which is nice. Essentially it's $5 for 3 hours of fun =)"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight   Setting: very aesthetically pleasing and comfortable seating   Food: ordered the set menu with thai beef curry. The bamboo shoots in the curry did not taste fresh and the sweet potato fries were cold and limp, but the rest of the meal was decent as it came with salad, soup and a mini pudding.   Drinks: ordered the coffee milk black tea with light sugar but it tasted like it didn't have any sugar because it was pretty bitter. Tried my friends almond milk black tea with regular sugar and it was waaay too sweet.   Service: the service was a disappointment. When my friend asked a server to add some water or tea to her sugar-saturated drink, the server adjusted it a little and then told her that she should've asked for light ice. How were we supposed to know that it was going to be over sweetened?   Overall: for such a high price, one would expect better food and better service. They have an extensive food menu but if you're just getting drinks, you're better off with getting it from the Chatime next door."}
{"text":"This review is mainly for their horrible service.  Went there yesterday Jan2.  This place is usually packed with people, yet last night wasnt that bad, although still filled with peopl.  We have 4 people, gonna order food yet the first thing the waiter told us was: If we order food, we might have to wait for half an hour.  Well we thought it was a friendly reminder and we have to eat anyway so we said thats ok.  Within the next 10 minutes, all the food and soup and rice arrived, like... ALL. Then we start to realize its probably their strategy of hoping customer wont order food.  THEN, alrhough we order drinks, we still want some water aftee our meal, but the waitee come back with two glasses, filled it with water and tell us they ran out of glass.  Seriously... ran out of glasses when they are not even super packed, and there are a lot of alternative you can do to provide your customer with a glass of water, like using plastic cups, other cups like the hot drinks cup ETC. This is just not the right attitude.  And whenever we try to get the waiter to add water for us or take away dishes, they are just chatting and ignored us, even they are just standing right beside the table.  oh and talking about that, this waiter standing right in the area all night and looking at people gives me a feeling he wants us to leave all the time when I saw the way he looked at people.  Maybe he didnt hv sucha thought but thats the feeling I got, which i think is horrible to have at a restaurant.  I havent been to this place for a while after graduating from University and now I dont think this will be a place on my list any more."}
{"text":"Great place, still a fan after all these years.   I don't like the service, however. But, it comes with the territory (or price tag, I should say). You can't expect a 5-star service when you pay less than $20 per drink & meal each time. I love their fried popcorn chicken and Taiwanese sausages. Also, I enjoy being on the patio during summer just hanging out with my friends.   Another plus? The ambiance is decent considering the type of food they serve there. Definitely worth a try for people who never been."}
{"text":"Godawful bubble tea and expensive as F**K!  The service was as horrid as the drinks.  They charge me $6.20 for a large Malt Milk tea with tapioca that tasted like sweetened dirty tap water =X  I will never go back to this place again and advice all to stay away as well."}
{"text":"Such a waste of nice decorations since their food is awful. My friend and I went there for lunch since magic noodles is under renovations and we ordered the beef noodle soup 10$ and Thai curry chicken combo 12$ . Noodle soup was plain and tasted like preservatives. Curry chicken was wayyyyyyyy too sweet. I barely touched the food.  Service was bad too. Tables were poorly cleaned despite few customers. At first I actually really really wanted to order their mini hotpot but I don't like the brown sauce it comes with so I asked the waitress for sesame oil instead. She immediately denied me and said she can't change it or they don't have it or some bs...???? How is it possible for an Asian kitchen not to have sesame oil???    There's so many better alternative places in the area. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Go to spot for late night bubble tea and food. Had their 7.99 deal which includes a protein, side, and half off a drink (between 12-2am). We ordered the popcorn chicken and sweet potato fries with a large slush. Food and drink came quickly and service was good. Portion was small so don't expect to be full. Make sure to communicate with staff clearly as we were notified of last call at 1:30pm although the restaurant closes at 3pm. At around 2pm, we saw a group order food with the food coming out 15 minutes later so I'm not sure why they were insisting last call on us. Also, be sure to check your bill as they forgot to deduct half off for our drink. This rating is a culmination of 3 visits. The previous two times we ordered off the regular menu and found the food to be below average. We ordered a sizzling chicken place which lacked both sizzle and chicken as most of then dish was garlic and onion. The squid was also poorly cooked and presented. Would visit again but during their late hours (they close at 3am). Would prefer Destiny's food over them though."}
{"text":"Hipster asian kind of place. Over-priced on most stuff. Limited menu selections. Mostly a place for drinks i guess. Nice atmosphere though if you want to sit for a while."}
{"text":"Always go there for chillin in late night. Cozy time to hangout after late movie show, very nice decor and ambience, the service was slow though, one server cover too many tables. They have tons of tea to order, I personally never order food here. You will be charged $3.00 per person if you come without put an order, eventhough you come with a group of people. My favourite is the very very mango juice."}
{"text":"This is a good place to come to hang out with your friends and just relax/chat. The bubble tea is OK (Ten Ren's is better). However, their 'Very Very Mango Slush' is one of my favorites since I'm an avid mango-lover. It comes with mango slush and huge mango chunks! Awesome, yeah? One thing I don't recommend ordering is the milk tea (although it could have just been one bad experience). It tasted more like water than milk or tea... I usually don't complain about the food to waiters but I refused to drink watered down milk tea. They kindly remade it and it was still watery but I just let it go...  Ambience is wonderful. Very cozy, clean and a lot of seating available.  As far as food goes, it isn't the greatest but that's understandable since they specialize in bubble tea but if you were to get food, then order the popcorn chicken. It comes with thousand island sauce (I think) but it's something that never disappoints."}
{"text":"The green apple slushie tastes like regular apple juice. In New York, the green apple slushies are a bit sour. The lychee slush is really good though. Small is a pretty reasonable size."}
{"text":"The place is new and has a nice atmosphere. Tonight was my second visit with my teenaged son as he liked it the first time we went. When we arrived, there was a note stating that the debit /credit machine was not working which the hostess reminded us before seating us. A minor inconvenience but we were ok with it. We sat down and waited for about 25 minutes for someone to come take our order or even give us a drink. Staff were speedily walking around and ignoring our table's attempts to get their attention. At one point, three wait staff stood by us, ignoring us again. They were quite apologetic to the table beside us because they had ordered a drink but the waitress didn't write down the size although they seemed not to care that we were waiting to order. My son really wanted to stay as he enjoyed the food the first visit (although service was not that great that time either which I originally blamed on it being the opening week). We finally gave up and walked out. As we stood up and walked away, one of the wait staff looked over at us and he seemed relieved that we were finally leaving. We were not rude in any way and we tried to be patient by politely waiting but the service here is just terrible. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Drinks are average quality.  I prefer the drinks at Destiny and Ten Ren, although I prefer the food here.  They need to update their menu which doesn't seem to been changed in years.  There is free wi-fi, but it's always slow regardless when you come.  Destiny and Ten Ren has faster wi-fi.  I come here a lot since it's one of the places my whole family can agree on.  My son loves the beef paper hot pot.  It's a good place to meet with a large group to chat and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere -- dimly lit at night, with a good variety of table sizes and easy-to-reach outlets for those that need to plug in their devices. Not too loud, even with large groups scattered about. The background music could use some work (it's a bit jarring to hear an ad come on between pop songs!) The old location used to play trip-hop sometimes...would prefer that kind of music.   Love that it is open so late (3am!) It is so rare to find a late-night haunt in Markham. Bonus that the service is accommodating and does not rush you, even after last call.   The drinks are okay. Wish they allowed for greater customization (sugar and ice levels.) Ordered drinks sugar-free a couple of times only to have them come with sugar. Not a big deal for me, but a warning to those watching their sugar intake. I find their teas are more floral than at other bubble tea places. Milk black tea, and milk green tea are my go-to choices. I have no complaints about any other flavours, though, so if the mood strikes, I don't hesitate to try other drinks.   The food is also okay. Not a gourmet experience, but good comfort food. The hot pots look to be popular, though I haven't tried one yet. I like the stewed beef (rice and noodle soup) and the calamari. The chicken cutlet, popcorn chicken and Taiwanese sausage are great for snacking, too! The only downside for the food is that it is slightly over-priced for the quantity and quality (although on par with the area.)  All in all, I like this Go For Tea and am glad they re-opened after the Thornhill location closed down!"}
{"text":"Good selection of drinks. My fav is honeydew milk tea.  Food & desserts are mediocre.  I dig their interior design & decorations.   This place is too casual for romantic dinner dates yet the lighting is too dim for casual dining.  Nothing special about this place there are better Taiwanese eateries out there."}
{"text":"im from california and where im at theres a pearl (tapioca) place on just about every block. my family took me here the last time i was in town and i absolutely loved it!   the decor and the whole vibe of the place is pretty cool and chill.  i just like the concept of it because its huge and open late so you can potentially sit n study in there (if u like to study in the dark).   but anyways! i really really enjoyed everything we had there. i remember garlic sauce and fried tofu! popcorn chicken on a classy modern plate and milk teas that come in beer mugs to me. milk teas here in california are still better i think but it was decent. in general it was very different! not our average pearl places. i wanted to try more sweets but its had to eat all that stuff in one seating. haha  i heard the place gets really busy but we went on a weekday night so we didnt really have a problem with that. but then again i must say we got seated in some corner where no one could see us.  had to push a button for service and it was amazingly SLOW! but yeah...will and must go back again when im back in canada...but only for food."}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews before I ventured out here because most of it is true. Very disappointing bubble tea and quite possibly the darkest tea house I have ever been to."}
{"text":"I think Ten Ren's bubble tea is better, but Go For Tea is cheaper. I like nut flavours so tried the almond and it was pretty good. Better atmosphere than Ten Ren - you can easily just sit there and chat/play games/read. The waiters are kind of really fobby, though (our didn't speak english well). They messed up one of our drinks, and after they took it back, we joked \"man they're just going to throw it out.\" Nope. We saw one of the bubble tea baristas drinking it as we left lol."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I was here for bbt.  I was a regular when the place first opened up but the service and quality was declining so my friends and I stopped going all together.  Their slush drinks and hot teas are pretty good but you can always expect them to give you the wrong orders.  I would strongly recommend that you check your bill before paying it; there is always a discrepancy with the bill and the change that are returned.  Cheers."}
{"text":"I've been to Go For Tea over 30 times over the past 4 - 5 years since MANY of my friends seem to like it for our weekend \"hang out\".  However, I would never go here on my own.  Food/Drink Quality & Price: Their drinks are nothing spectacular priced similar to most other BBT locations. I really enjoy the Very Mango Slush. Many of my friends really liked the food at Go For, but I have been food poisoned 3 times (my husband once) from here.  I really like the braised beef (but that's what poisoned us) and once by the popcorn chicken. I am convinced that they use old meet or have unsanitary cooking conditions (or cooks/servers/waiters don't wash their hands properly.    Facility: The water in the washroom is RIDICULOUSLY cold and their staff use these washrooms.  Knowing that, I can tell that they would not wash their hands properly before handling food.  I noticed this years ago and it still has not changed. Each time I've tried to give the establishment another chance but I don't think I'll be ordering food from here again.  It's kind of hard to avoid the place when many of my Asian friends like it so much.  The ambiance and decor of the location are great.  But that is pretty much all their brings the score up for this business.  I am convinced that it is why many Asians like going here (in addition to the waitresses).   Service: It's a little sad actually how many patrons (my friends included) come here for the \"hot waitresses\".  I find them rather average looking and at times incompetent with taking orders.  In addition, these poor girls have to deal with oogling eyes.  The waiters that work here aren't easy on the eyes but they work better and faster (noticing empty cups and dishes).   Overall: I will never fully understand the appeal of this location.  I have many great memories here because I've been coming for 5 years with friends... but it's not like the service or food had anything to do with it.  The atmosphere is good for socializing but ever since they banned card games on weekends, I still do not know why people come here.   If I had to choose from Go For Tea, Destiny's or Ten Rens, I would choose Ten Rens over the rest for sure."}
{"text":"I have encountered way too many horrible incidents from this place to keep track. The only reason I ever go is because my friends choose to come here. Terrible service and they manage to screw up almost every order.   Here are some examples: - I would often find things in my drink that aren't supposed to be there. - Some items never arrive. Sometimes even charged for it. - Asked for honey green tea. Got black tea instead and they tried convincing me it's green tea and the dark colour is \"because of the tapioca\". Sent it back and got another that was actually green tea. - The best one was when they included a surprise plastic lid inside my bowl of ramen at the very bottom. Didn't notice until I was halfway done eating it and dug out something hard. How on earth do you manage to do that? Still charged me for it even though the server was all wtf when I fished it out for him to see.  Bottom line is don't go here. Serissa is a 5 minute drive away with better drinks and service."}
{"text":"The drinks are okay, food is alright. It's got the most food selections than the other bubble tea shops in the area. So if you're looking to eat a meal instead of a snack then this is the place.  Only gripe is the interior looks like Christmas ornaments all year round. They haven't taken them down.   It needs to be updated and maintained, and I find it's too dark inside. Gone here since it first opened.   There are better bubble tea places in the area like Ten Ren and Destiny in my honest opinion."}
{"text":"As an out of towner who visits Markham occasionally, I am very impressed with the atmosphere and drink selection. I make sure to go there every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The service here was quite fast, making this a respectable alternative to Destiny's.   Ordered : Almond Milk Tea w/tapioca  - smooth taste  - a bit on the sweet side  Total Cost: just over $5 including tip.  Overall feeling: I would choose this place over destiny's if only because it is $0.50 cheaper for the basic drinks and the staff are more attentive. The payment system is also adapted more so for bill splitting than destiny."}
{"text":"The bubble tea is very good and they have a large assortment of hot tea as well. The health drinks are also quite good and differentiate it from other bubble tea spots.   I am not a huge fan of Chinese food, so I can't comment on the food except for the fried rice which is tasty but they have recently shrunk the portion size dramatically! When we complained nothing was done and here we come to the downfall of most bubble tea places -- service.  I've never really seen great service at a bubble tea place and Go For Tea is no exception. The waitstaff is basically competent but somewhat grim and harried. If all goes well it doesn't matter, but watch out if you have a question or problem: you won't get far with the waiters or even the manager. They're not rude exactly; they're just indifferent.  Oh, and the desserts (with the exception of the toast) are miniscule and not worth it at all. Better to have your tea and then cross the street to Demetres.  In short: go for the tea, nevermind the food."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to bubble tea places to sit and hang out, so this was an interesting experience for me.  Their drink selection is overwhelming so I went with a friend's recommendation and tried the popular \"Very Mango Mango Slush\" and it was awesome! If you like mangoes you'll love this drink!  The food items were good, and I liked that the wait staff didn't hover over you - you press a button on the table if you need anything. It's very relaxed and casual. The free Wi-Fi is a plus too!  I have to agree with the other reviewers that the leftover Christmas decorations are distracting and tacky. Otherwise the decor in here is quite nice - dark wood on white. The benches are do start to get uncomfortable after a while, but I'd rather deal with the hard wood bench than sit on a gross padded one with torn vinyl repaired with duct tape that I've seen in other places."}
{"text":"Giving a bad rating due to bad service. It's so bad it's kind of funny. The waiter here tonight is purposefully avoiding eye contact each time he passes by. It's not even that busy. There only four other tables in my area that has a total of about 10.  Would love to write about the food or drink, but it's been about 20mins since I have sat and am debating about leaving or seeing how long it takes them to come by.   Decor is nice here, good seating and can accommodate large groups which is nice.   Music is not too loud so you can have conversations.   So finally the hostess came by after staring at her as she passes, she looks at me in a confused look which then switches to irritation. \"You ready?!\" She exclaims.   On a brighter note, drinks came out in under 5mins. Although my cold drink was warm, but a bit of stirring the ice around fixed that. Got the coffee milk black tea, it's ok. Definitely not up to the taste/quality of another bbt shop right across the street.   Prices here are on the higher end of bbt shops. But it is to be expected."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Go for Tea Cuisine: Coffee/Tea/Chinese Location: Thornhill Address: 230 Commerce Valley Dr E Price Range: $10-15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 5 Service: 2 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 4  Extra information:  *HongKong Cafe + BBTea store *Large seating area *Party room avail as well as outside seating *Can go for meals or just drinks  As a Vancouverite, I come from the city of bubbletea. There is a bubbletea store in every corner no matter where you go in Vancouver. Ever since it originally became popular in Taiwan and the trend migrated to Vancouver, I was there. Starting with my taro bubbletea, oreo smoothie, fresh strawberry slush and the odd mint milktea- without a doubt I can say I know my bubbletea. As I got older, bubbletea food places became popular as well. You start from the basics, salty & peppery chicken, marinated chicken wings to condensed milk toast. You name it? I've had it. Bubbletea food should have their own category in restaurant listings, it does in my list. I knew leaving Vancouver, I will def miss all the bubbletea food- so I was super excited when my highschool friend from back home told me about 'Go for Tea' and took me there!  Go for Tea is a huge BBtea place located in Markham. When you walk in, there are at least 5 different sections to the restaurant. They have tacky Christmas theme decorations everywhere with gold and red bows attached to every place you can imagine.   Once you walk in, you can choose between booths and tables. I noticed there are auto call-buttons on each table, but it didn't really seem to work cause noone ever came by when we pressed the button.  They have very large menu consisting of main, hot pot, meals with rice, noodles and then drink. I found the menu very hard to read due to the lay out because it's very messy and all over the place. As I was trying to figure out what they offered, it felt like I was reading those books you have to concentrate super hard to understand.  Ordered: DEEP FRIED INTESTINE WITH GREEN ONION 3.5/5 *Small plate of deep fried intestine for $9.99 *Green onion is stuffed inside of a deep fried large intestine *Very chewy and is good with salt and black pepper that's served on the side *Chinese restaurants usually serve intestines marinated or deep fried *Comes with pickled radish and carrot that's sweet and tangy *Pickled vegetables are good in between to cleanse the palette *I really liked this dish, but found it to be a little pricey  Ordered: HONEY GREENTEA 5/5 *Small size for $3.99 *One of my favorite bubble tea flavors cause bubbletea food can be quite salty, so I just order this to wash it down *Honey green tea is simple but sweet and refreshing *You could def taste the honey in this drink *I usually ask for it to be less sweet but completely forgot this time. Next time I will make sure to remember!  Ordered: BRAISED PORK BELLY SPECIAL 5/5 *Served with rice, side dish and a soup for $10.99 *This is a combo but it's very big, almost enough for 2 people *Rice that is served in a bowl is almost 3 times the normal size *Soup (beef+potato) is very decent for a side and it comes in a miso soup bowl *Salad is made with imitation crab and lettuce topped with sweet honey mustard sauce *Bamboo shoot and beef pieces (sidedish) was good with rice *There were around 8 pieces of large pork belly *Flavor is very strong for the sauce (sweet soy sauce based) that's poured over pork pieces *There could be less sauce for this dish *Pork belly is very fatty, therefore making it tender and juicy *Few pieces were luke warm inside though, they need to reheat it better *I would get this dish again for sure  Ordered: DEEP FRIED CHICKEN NUGGET WITH RICE 4/5 *Deep fried chicken nuggets, rice, marinated eggs, salad and a sidedish for $9.99 *Comes with meat sauce on top of the rice which was nice because this dish can be kind of dry *There are about 9~10 chicken pieces *Deep fried chicken nugget is always a basic dish at bbtea restaurants and you can't really go wrong with this dish *This would be good with hot sauce or ketchup, depending on what you prefer  This place gets super busy on weekends and holidays. Keep in mind that there are no card playing after 9 on weekends. I saw good number of people here with their laptop doing studies or whatever they needed to do. There are lots of food and drinks option so this would be a good place to just chill with friends.  Summary: I really liked this place. It was my first time visiting Markham and go for tea really reminded me of those bbtea places back in Vancouver. The only downside to this place is that it is very far from downtown and you can only get there by driving. If I am craving bbtea food and am willing to go far, I would come here!"}
{"text":"Two of my friends and I came here for a place to sit and chat. We ordered bubble tea and mango crushed ice (actually we wanted the shaved ice and it's one of their promoted items but they didn't have it available. Why promote it if you don't have it? Whatever). Drinks and the dessert were pretty standard so no complaints there.   The service however was horrible. We had trouble catching the attention for someone to take our orders when we had been waiting for over 10 minutes. It was also a challenge to flag someone down for some water and for our bill.   When we finally caught someone for the bill, two servers were bickering between themselves to decide who to serve us. They were speaking in Chinese to each other thinking we did not understand. I also had to explain multiple times to both servers how to separate our bills (aka add the cost of the crushed ice to one of our drinks). I even circled each item and labelled them \"A\", \"B\", etc. When we asked about an extra charge on our crushed ice, the servers were very aggressive, asking us to prove that their price was wrong by violently flipping through the menu.   My friends and I are not difficult customers and this experience has led me to believe that the staff here are unprofessional and incompetent. Sorry."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this Go For Tea location since my high school days (almost a decade ago). As for decor, not much has changed but they finally attached the service bell to the walls in lieu of the plaques that took up space on the already tight tables.   We ordered drinks and Taiwanese popcorn chicken during our stay. The popcorn chicken was definitely subpar to say the least; the flavour wasn't there and it was as definitely overfried. If you order a large drink, be ready as they are served in a large beer mug and will definitely have you running to the washroom within the next hour. The drinks have always been consistent and hasn't changed much since its conception.  Overall, the drinks are still decent after so many years but snack taste could definitely use some work. It's great to see Go For Tea still thriving after so many years, but not surprising given the consistency in quality. In addition, we stayed over three hours and the staff were cool about it (which is always a plus)."}
{"text":"the first I went there was with my friend, she introduced that to me because of their great lunch sets. And the place is super quiet with very high ceiling design. I love their interior design which creates lots of privacy for group gathering.  I spent almost 3 hours there with my friend for lunch, and no one disturb us. you can say that it's good or bad, because it takes a long time to ask a waitress to come over.  There was only one waitress serving on that day which means it takes really a long time to order/ handling food and giving you the bill.   the food portion was big with good presentation, I would give 5 stars to the food quality and taste.   One thing I must mention is their washrooms, it's so neat. Each washroom has toilet, sink , dryer...etc. It's clean and stylish.  The bubble tea is yummy, and the cost is very reasonable too (Around $3.99-4.99).   Will definitely go again and again."}
{"text":"Had a taro slush..ordered it with tapioca..naturally they screwed up my order...finally when they brought one out, it tasted really bad...I've had amazing bubble tea before and this was horrible. Definitely not recommended."}
{"text":"Knew that the service here was bad but now they're racist? They outrightly told my friend to leave because they don't serve \"their\" kind of people. None of my friends and I will be supporting them and their archaic beliefs , especially in a city like Toronto. People there are 3 other cafes at this plaza that have much better service..."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here with 1 or 2 people because it has a good atmosphere. A great place to have chats and catch up with an old friend. Sometimes I study with my friend or we play a game of cards while chatting for an hour or two.   I do enjoy their lunch specials because it has good portions, on weekends they have good combos with 50% off drinks. Last time I got the mandarin orange black tea (hot) and I really liked it. It also came with sweet syrup but I found it perfect without adding it. Portions for their afternoon tea (weekend) was pretty small, i was still hungry after, but I guess that's why drinks are 50% off with that combo.  Overall, this is always a place I go to if I want to sit with a friend and just catch up. But definitely not my first choice for food or drinks."}
{"text":"this place is huge. the decor is nice. it's a good place if you have 10+ people in your party. but i'm not sure about their food... we ordered a lot of things, but the only thing that was memorable was their popcorn chicken. unfortunately i didn't to try any of their teas, but i did try their bubble tea and it was horrible."}
{"text":"The decor is beautiful inside! However, the quality of bubble tea does not reflect the prices they charge. Everything is quite mediocre here but it's a nice place to hang out with your group of friends! It's about $5-6 for a small bubble tea but I guess it's worth it since they let you sit there for hours and hours. (they're opened pretty late)"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, and I'm basing it only on that one time.  And there's a reason for me being there only once.  It was actually last year I was there, and I pass by this place all the time, because of my favourite Korean BBQ, Chako being literally steps away.   But really, the only good thing about this place is the decor. It was nice, roomy, almost nightclubish feel to it. The bubble tea was sub par. I went with my boyfriend and all our friends ... And all of our bubble teas were just watered down. The cakes were nice, very nicely decorated. And I feel like it's just too pricey for what it's worth. I never got the chance to try the food, since I came here right after Chako.  It's a nice place for social gatherings if you're looking for a hip, trendy place to hang with friends. But to get the best of the best of bubble teas, you're better off looking somewhere else."}
{"text":"I can't stand Go For Tea.  Terrible, extremely over priced food and horrible service.   I've only been here once, had a terrible experience and never came back. It was that bad. I usually give places 2 chances before I cross if off my list ... But Go For Tea isn't worth it.  Save your money and go to Green Grotto or even Ten Ren."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the bubble tea that I had did not have the tapioca cooked through enough and this ruining my bubble tea experience."}
{"text":"Go For Tea is a good place to hang out late hours when other places aren't open. Their bubble teas are pretty huge amidst the cost of the bubble tea. Desserts is sub par, compared to other bubble tea places with desserts. However, their food is good for their taiwanese and chinese cuisine. Customer service is good and they do separate bills."}
{"text":"Nice and relatively quiet setting on a Friday evening. Good place to sit and have drinks to hang out. It has a nicer ambiance than some of the other bubble tea chains. I ordered the Lychee Green Tea which was a bit too sweet.   The restaurant also had a button at each table to ask for a waiter/waitress. This was handy... except that I don't think it worked and we ended up having to flag them down each time to order, get the bill etc."}
{"text":"Terrible service and also slow waited 15 minutes and wasn't served , ppl who came after us were served, looks like racial bias is still prevalent. There is no way that I was the only person to experience such a matter at this establishment. I wouldn't recommend going to this place unless you want to experience this. We ended up leaving with no service. This place is pure garbage."}
{"text":"Bought a small taro slush for 7 bucks. Tastes like something you can get at a mall bubble tea store. Nothing special. Add a handful of tapioca for 80 cents. Drinks came extremely slow and the server was rude. Only reason why we came is because it's a late night spot for the middle of the week.   Next time, just gonna post up at a Tim's and pay the same price for a meal."}
{"text":"Waitress looked annoyed and angry while taking our order, and portions were tiny for the high prices they were.   I would only come here at night if everything is closed and there is no where else to go. Other than that it's a complete waste of time and money.  All in all, horrible service, high prices, and poor value."}
{"text":"This is the closest place to my home for a quick bite and some drinks so I come here often.  How ever, recently I noticed that the tea quality here is terrible.  Otherwise it's not a bad place.  Food:  4 stars. They are quite amazing with the lunch combos.  Portions are decent and quality in line with Markham quality Chinese food  Service: 3 stars.  Drinks overall: 3 stars, except if you get Teas which I would give 1 star.  They shamelessly sell Lipton tea bags for 7.99 which is the main reason I cannot give a tea shop a good rating that charges this much for a bag of Lipton tea.  The sweet drinks are also quite poor in quality.  The blended fruits drinks are a much better value."}
{"text":"They have a nice selection of bubble tea as well as food.  Very nice grilled squid that comes with a great radish salad.  The desserts and shaved ice are also very tasty.  The decor is very impressive, especially during Christmas time.  The main problem is huge lines and lack of adequate parking, especially Friday and Saturday night."}
{"text":"I didn't have a chance to come to this place frequently like before since there are so many other dessert places opened up. Tonight is the night that I decided to STAY AWAY from this place (or at lest this location). Drinks and foods quality wasn't good. Service to terrible. Period."}
{"text":"Go For Tea--yeah why not--a fob name for a fob establishment.   Never have I come here to that of my own accord, but regardless of my utter indifference for bubble tea, it is a inescapable social obligation of a Chinese person living in the GTA .    People from all walks of life visit this tea shoppe, but I can't figure out why.  Friends from Richmond Hill, Thronhill, Bridal Path, Scarborough, North York, Hogs Hollow, even Downtown all come here.  But what warrants this place's popularity?  It looks and feels similar to other places like Destiny's, only slightly more intimate.  Could that be the reason?   The décor is very cosy despite the high ceilings, the lightings design (I must admit) is very well done for a tea shoppe, crisp rectangular chandeliers hang from quasi-wood-like objects, and there's a semi-private section to the North side of the entrance where there is constant card-playing.  It really does feel like a very wide corridor.  Half the seats here are wall panels, the other half booths.   Also, the very highly maintained washroom is noteworthy, as I have never encountered an occasions where it was dirty.  This is very important.  Fine, it's a comfortable space.  I can say that the drink selection is rather extensive, but that's the case for most places..as long as you're not at 168.  The food is identical to that of Destiny's, perhaps smaller in portion, but equal in quality.  But the waitresses here are obviously prettier, and better uniformed. I'm almost certain that the hiring process for the female wait staff here is based on how high their uniform skirts rises on these girls' legs, and if it does not reach a height considered to be promiscuous, you cannot be hired.  Hey, it's March 8th...Happy International Women's Day!    Yup, don't why I ever come here....^"}
{"text":"The majority of my positive experience is due to its decor and quiet environment which I'm sure will change once more people are aware that this location is even open for business. Go For Tea is a lounge bubble tea restaurant and is much more sophisticated than its opposite competitor Chatime (literally facing each other across the parking lot). This new location is much bigger than its own location near East Beaver Creek.   The menu is exactly the same as the other locations - no surprise there. While its food menu is admittedly extensive and a notable advantage over other bubbletea-only competitors, they really need to step up their game with their drinks. Unfortunately, the quality remains the same watery, unimpressive drinks they had before Chatime became popular. It's been a while since I've been to Go For Tea, but their food items seems to be even more expensive than before. A 'special promotion' spicy herbal hotpot is $18 - I could go for ayce hotpot elsewhere for a few dollars more.   Go For Tea used to be a great quiet place for studying, from where I sat I only saw one visible outlet. Elsewhere there are a fair number of high tables/stools, so I'm not sure how many spots are available for people who bring their laptops for the day.   Patio area is not yet opened, but the fenced off area appears quite a bit smaller than its prior location - definitely a shame as a larger patio would be nice in this area."}
{"text":"amazing decor and it ends there.  food and drinks are ok, nothing special, i had a rose oolong and i must admit it was pretty good tea but the experience just ruined it. my friends ordered bubble tea, it came to our table one by one...why? 10 minutes later my tea is still nowhere to be found so i pressed the button to call service, the guy came with an attitude he said \"Ya?!\" so i said i was missing an order of tea, didnt even explain or asked he jst left. i saw them rushing to \"boil\" the water with a milk steamer, my water was jst warm (40f tops) so i finally got my tea and first thing i noticed is a chipped ceramics. bacteria and lead heaven right there.   that time when we visit it wasnt even busy. 4 tables is being served.  forgetting orders happens, dont give attitude to the customer for your boo-boo's and make sure you do it right when the order is late already.  i paid about roughly $8 for a cup of tea, sure it's pricey but i expect a way better service and toss those chipped ceramics."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and interior. It's a great place to hang out with friends, bring a laptop and work, or just sit around.  Everything on the menu is overpriced. But then again, you pay $4 for a bubble tea and sit there for ~2 hours.   Lunch menu is quite cheap, around $8 I believe. It tastes like Chinese fast food. Don't depend on the food too much.  During afternoon tea time, there is cake for $3.5 if you buy it along with a tea. The cake is delicious and quite big, I highly recommend!   The service is horrible. It takes forever to find a waiter. They don't go around and search for customers who need help, instead, they just stand somewhere. Which is understandable because they want to give guests some private space... but not very useful when it comes to ordering.   I always read some of the Asian magazines when I come."}
{"text":"Cozy place, clean, with nice furniture. It's a pretty good place to just catch up with your friends or to have dessert. Their bubble tea isn't anything super special but it's decent. On the other note: the service here is pretty bad.. They're friendly but take quite a while to take you to your seat or to even go around to hand you napkins.. And they're rarely around so you if want to pay your bill , I recommend to just go to the desk"}
{"text":"This has become a regular lunch spot for me!  Conveniently located with ample parking outside and seating inside.  Food is quite good and they have a lot of variety to offer.  Have tried several different lunch sets and other food items, so far everything has been great!  Nice interior decor, not crowded at all during lunch hour.  They have afternoon tea set that is very good value, I'd like to try that next."}
{"text":"It's dark, and quite loud, especially at night when it gets very busy. The drinks are overpriced for subpar quality - I suggest going to Chatime instead."}
{"text":"I've been here around five times, and every single time was a negative experience. If you're really only going here to wait around 30 minutes for a drink and then talk with your friends, it's only mildly acceptable. You're better off going to Green Grotto which is only across the plaza.   The first time I went I was quite excited but the servers all looked insanely bored and didn't even come to take your orders for a long time. The food came really slowly and a lot of my friends didn't get what they ordered. They aren't even accommodating when they mess up on your order. It took a long time to talk to them about fixing it.   Other times, the waiters looked very judgmental as I was waiting for someone to come. In general, the staff don't care about you at all and they will get your order right 60% of the time. The atmosphere in Go For Tea is supposed to feel nightclub-ish(?) and so the restaurant is dimly lit. It makes me fall asleep and almost all of their furniture is now falling apart after years of use.  When it first opened, it was a new thing as there weren't too many cafe type restaurants but now there are many and this one is the one where I've had the worst experiences. Whether you go to Destiny's or Green Grotto or Snakes & Lattes, avoid this place."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a teenager. I have never gotten good service here. They take forever to come and actually take down your order. One time it took a good 40 minutes to get served and it wasn't even a busy night at all. If you come here with a date, you're sometimes seated in a table only inches away from the next couple beside you. I've asked several times for a more private spot only to be told no.  The drink orders are often incorrect. If you tell them so, some waiters/waitresses will try to convince otherwise. Order just a water with your meal and you'll never get it without pestering at least several servers for it. Once you get it, they give you a tiny cup half filled with water. Thanks!  On the plus side, once you finally manage to make your order the food can come out pretty quick. The food itself is also not bad. Not noteworthy, just enjoyable enough to justify coming here more than once. I recommend trying out the paper hot pot. It's a pretty cool sight to see soup in a paper bowl over fire.  They also have more interesting dishes such as frog legs which are also pretty good. The price for their dishes is also reasonable.  The drinks themselves are overpriced. Many of the better ones being $8. The cheaper drinks for $4-5, often the bubble teas, are just your average powdered crap you can buy anywhere else.   Overall, the decor and ambiance is nice although they tend to leave the Christmas decorations up all year round unless it's Halloween. The service is terrible but the food isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"im a fan of go for tea but not this location. I came here several times because i live nearby  the service was always such garbage. It was my go to location for late night or cant decide what to do place. but then one night we waited so long to be seated, servers kept walking away from us and when we finally got seated they practically served us water and FORGOT ABOUT US. We placed our orders drinks and food and waited, then 15 mins in two tables got seated after beside us and they placed their order after us and their food and drinks arrived before ours. We asked several servers to check on our orders the one that took our order was nowhere to be seen. Then we waited for an hour and nothing came the tables beside us already all finished eating. We just decided to leave it felt bad at first because we already ordered but we gave them several chances to check on our food. I now to go the downtown markham location and avoid this location at all cost"}
{"text":"The service and the drink was nothing too spectacular but I must say that the atmosphere was really nice.  Very roomy and comfortably seating for the most part.  Good place to just have a snack or a non-alcoholic drink at night with some friends.  I ordered an almond tea drink and it was good...not amazing but it was good.  I didn't order any snacks, but I will do so the next time I come here.  I'll report on that when I do try the food.  It got progressively busier as the night went on though.  Probably better to come before 9pm, especially on a weekend.  There were people waiting at the door by then."}
{"text":"This location is so much better than the scarb one because of the service. This is the go to place cause it's open late and convenient. The food is mediocre, my top picks is the  popcorn chicken and Taiwanese sausage fried rice.  The bubble tea is a hit or miss. My favourite would be the almond milk tea but it's usually really good or watered down or has yucky little particles u can feel in your mouth I'm assuming from the powder they mix it with. The price is a bit high for the quality of food you get but I guess you pay for the convenience of having somewhere to hang out during late hours"}
{"text":"I've been coming here frequently since high school for long, deep heart-to-heart talks with friends. Something about its dim hanging light bulbs and spacious seating make it so comfortable. The waiters are really attentive (ask if I need water refills frequently), fast and never pester you to leave even after your food is finished, so sometimes I would be there for 8 hours.   I've tasted quite a few things on the menu, and everything has been quite delicious. Today I ordered a beef paper hot pot. The broth was very fragrant even without the spicy or thai options. There was around ten rolls of raw beef, and some tofu, enoki mushroom, nappa cabbage, and squid balls already in the pot. The flame eventually died by itself and it wasn't overly steamy. It was really filling with the rice. I also got the honeydew milk tea with tapioca. It wasn't too sweet and it was very tasty. Other times I have ordered items like popcorn chicken and green curry seafood bento set, and I really enjoyed them all.  Price wise is not bad all. An entree is around 13 dollars, and drinks are 5 to 6 dollars with toppings costing additional. Honestly, if you stay for a few hours, it's really worth the few extra dollars."}
{"text":"I \"WAS\" very happy with the service here, and I came here on a frequent basis with my friends.... until last night... Host was very rude and gave a very sarcastic response to when I asked how long the wait was... He responded \"a long time...don't know\".... I asked for an approximate wait time, but he just brushed us off and continued to talk to his co-worker..... I am currently at Destiny's where the host actually went out of his way to clear a table during a busy time of the night...... Bye bye Go For Tea... You blew it...... Bad..."}
{"text":"This place really should deserve 1.5 star and all the positives I could think of are:  1. Comfortable and nice environment. 2. Decent service at night (ONLY at night during dinner hours).  Where the other 3.5 stars went? The list is just too long, so let's just say this:  1. I went there in late after around 5:30pm, waited for 15 minutes to be seated when seats are everywhere left, right and center. I assume the morning/early afternoon shift is nearly over at that point so the waiter/waitress just doesn't care anymore. But their initial impression was bad.   2. Sat down, they threw us a menu and then stood there like a mute. When I asked about certain options to put in my drink and the side dish to go with my food, the waitress rudely pointed at the menu and tell me to look at it. You call this service?  3. On multiple occasions I saw the waiter/waitress for the pre-6pm shift gathered together and just chat in the open while people were waving their hands to order and people waiting at the door.  4. Food portions were tiny.  5. Extremely lack of dessert options and for what little they have (i.e. slice of cheesecake), they charge a crazy price of $5.99 for it.  Avoid like a plague."}
{"text":"I don't understand what is the  hype with this place. Food is sub-par and BBTs are too sweet and no tea taste at all. Just sugar and powder. The wait is too long and no one greets you at the entrance  even when the place  is empty. Service is poor. Add extra money  for red bean bbt...that is ridiculous! Red bean is so common. Better options elsewhere. Would  not go again."}
{"text":"Drinks were fine, basically what you'd expect from a tea shop.  The service was remarkably poor - a tour de force in shitty and unprofessional treatment actually.    My father ordered red bean over shaved ice.  He immediately noticed the dish did not look or taste as it should.  He orders the same thing at another restaurant in Mississauga and it is usually sweeter.   It took him a while to put his finger on it but he eventually consulted the menu and figured out that the dish should come with condensed milk and some sort of syrup.  These two ingredients were omitted by the kitchen.  No big deal so far - these things happen after all.  So he politely and jokingly notified our server about it.  The waiter said he will check with the kitchen whether or not they made a mistake.  Now this was strange as the omission should not have been in doubt.  The waiter soon returned to notify us that the kitchen claims they did not make a mistake and informed him that the ingredients had indeed been added.   My father reiterated his evaluation of the dish and its missing ingredients.  The server defensively informed him that since the dish was partially eaten, that he could not verify the truth of my father's story.  At this point, my father was quite angry.  He is an honest man, and this waiter questioning his honesty was very upsetting to him.  I have worked in customer service before.  Usually in these scenarios, one would offer some remedy to the situation.  Instead, the now heated discussion devolved into my father asking the waiter how the restaurant could remedy the situation and the waiter responding with something to the effect of \"I don't know what you want from me\" and not in a helpful way either.  I suggested multiple times that he ask for his manager to intervene as clearly the interaction was going poorly and there was little chance of improvement.  My wife piped in to reiterate.  He did not do so and instead decided to rip off his apron and earpiece, ball up his fists and start pacing back and forth in front of the table.    I felt he looked like a guy not in control of his emotions and probably having a very bad day.  My wife later informed me that she felt he looked like was getting ready for a physical confrontation with my 70-year-old father and my wife who was holding our 8-month-old baby in her arms.  To be fair, I did not feel threatened, but she certainly did and that's enough for me.   Eventually, he was dragged away by a colleague, not before punching the wall on the way out.  I would suggest two things: 1) Better training for waiters on the subject of customer service and how to deal with unhappy customers. 2) This particular waiter should probably not deal with the public.  The escalation was unnecessary.   Being quick to become defensive, angry, and to take things personally are not good traits in the service industry."}
{"text":"Their menu seems enticing but after waiting for the server for over 15 mins our group of 8 decided to leave. I do want to return one day and be able to order a bowl of ramen and their desserts."}
{"text":"I'm lowering my rating because one of the servers is SO rude. A skinny plain looking guy with short spiky hair, usually wearing a white shirt (the others usually wear black). All the other servers are super friendly, except for this guy. Every time we come we pray that we don't get this guy.  Our party of 5+ used to come here all the time, but after tonight we're never coming back."}
{"text":"One of my go-to places for bubble tea. It's a nice dark atmosphere which makes it perfect for hanging out with friends, playing cards, or doing some group work. The service is always super fast, but the communication is lacking a little. Servers don't always do the best job."}
{"text":"- Located within VIP Cineplex building, on ground floor facing the parking lot - Plenty of parking available and underground, but it is now a very busy plaza, quite difficult to find a spot (so please watch your time) - Restaurant is very big in size, plenty of tables available (some with electric outlets as well) - Decor is modern, ambiance is very dim (kinda of romantic feeling-ish) - Service is nice, staff accommodating to help us change tables when we needed to use laptops + eat at the same time  Drinks - ordered an almond milk yogurt, large size (around $6-7) - regular drink, consistent but not too outstanding - size wise is actually pretty good if you want to talk/chill for a little while  Food - had their lunch/dinner specials (around $13.99)  - comes with a main dish, rice, soup, salad and dessert - ordered the Taiwanese Braised Pork - Pork was a little tough to chew, quantity wise was good - the fatty oil added an extra kick with the rice - Dessert pudding was nice, a little sweet - And it was actually quite filling (initially thought it won't fill me up)  Overall an okay place - similar and consistent with their old location near East Beaver Creek. Price wise has gone up, but not too surprising. Would recommend as a good place to work/chit chat or plan travel activities!  Tip - free wifi available, but kicks you off every now and then; just gotta reconnect or stay active consistently"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Went out for late night bubble tea and desserts with a group of friends. We all had our minds set on an order and clicked the buzzer for a server to come take our order. We waited over 20 minutes and none of the servers had approached us. We had to then physically get up and call one of the servers over so that they can finally take our order.   One friend, in particular was lactose and tolerant so we questioned one of the servers about different options. The server could not speak English and had a hard time comprehending what we were asking. We had to then call over another server who spoke English and the second server had no idea what lactose and tolerant even meant. My friend had decided to not order anything just to be safe, and while another server was taking our order they were demanding each of us to order something as it's their \"rule\" for each guest to order an item.   We explained to the server about our friend's situation and the server told us if our friend does not order anything the rest of us (6 others) will each be charged $1 each. This was completely and utterly disrespectful as it made no sense for the rest of us to pay extra because one of our friends was not gonna order anything. We ended up calling a manager to speak with them and the manager was completely ignorant. We ended up walking out of the store because their policy was completely bullshit. Other cafes/restaurants/dine-ins do not require each person to order an item so it made no sense for Go For Tea to do so. All in all, they lost over $50 of business that day because of their idiotic policy and attitude towards us.   Definitely do not recommend this place to anyone, especially to those who are big on customer service."}
{"text":"worse food ever, especially the lunch or dinner special, I'm 100% sure that the red curry chicken I had was made of left over chicken from different Chinese dishes because every bite tasted different and the red curry sauce is ready made from jars that was added to the food. I have travelled the world and ate all kind of food but never something as bad as this"}
{"text":"Go For Tea was once admired as one of the best bubble tea shops in the GTA. Unfortunately, due to its terrible service (from refusing to split bills to forgettting orders to giving the wrong drinks), many have written off Go For Tea both from a product and service standpoint. While I recognize that its bubble tea is indeed good, I am turned off by its complete lack of a customer service mindset."}
{"text":"I gotta give it to this place...it has a mind-blowing selection of drinks and an ambiance anyone and EVERYONE would enjoy.  The decor is considered posh-like for a place where you simply go for snacks and drinks with friends.  If you need a cool hang-out place while out on a date THIS WOULD BE IT!!!  Definitely try their condensed milk toast...it's DEEEE-'lish!  Oh...stay away from the fried-tofu thing (it's on the appetizer list)...it's not tasty.  However, DO EXPERIMENT WITH THE DRINKS! =D"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday to have a meeting with several other friends.  I didn't expect as we just need a drink and some snack around the afternoon time.  The decor is pretty good and well designed.  However, the noise level was off the roof, and it was just really loud like a Chinese dim sum place during lunch time.  I don't know whether is the design of the place or the people talking too loud.    The waitress had a \"whatever look\" on her face and totally looked like she didn't want to be there.  I don't want to work on holidays either, but since you were given this shift, maybe make the best of it.  Go for tea is famous for their high price beverages, and my order was pretty tasty.  However, the service was super slow.  I think they need more baristers because I waited for 30 minutes for my drink.  When we had the bill, we clearly waited to pay by credit card, and it was funny that the waitress brought the machine and didn't speak at all and left the bill there.  And somehow she just left after couple of seconds.  It was really awkward, and we kind of just gathered whatever cash or coins we had, and just wanted to leave.  My friends were pretty nice to leave a 10% tip despite poor service.  I would have given the bill just enough money with a only 25 cents tip with this kind of service.    Hope it was just an isolated incident with the service since I do like coming this place a lot."}
{"text":"This was our first time checking out this location and from the minute we walked in through the door this place was crap.   We waited by the front to be seated having had eye contact with 3 different servers and it took a total of 5 mins to finally be seated.   We ordered our snacks that came out quite quickly but the big issue is....  Our bubble tea took 25 mins to come out.   We asked 2 different servers about our drinks and they brushed us off like it was no issue.   The waitress informs us that they are short staff and that there is one person making the drinks.  If your business is based off of drinks why would you only have one person making them?   After complaining to several waiters we finally got a hold of the manager and she was quick to apologize and quickly blamed that she didn't know it would be so busy today. She kept offering 10% off our drinks and wanted to just leave. Needless to say all the wait staff didn't even care what we had to say.   The service is terrible. Don't come here!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is more on the pricey side... Like destiny!!  Hmm.. I ordered a lunch set $10.99 and it tasted OK.. It actually didn't taste that good, the flavor of the pork tasted a bit off.   Also the vegetable spring rolls tasted bland, and the soup just tasted like water. But I didn't expect much from a tea /loafting/ hangout / bubble tea place.    Also ordered popcorn chicken ... Portion was smaller than I expected..  For 10.99.....more greeon onions than chicken lol  The popcorn chicken isn't that good compared to cha me cha / papa Chang ..   Plus a kiwi slush large $3.75 - tasted decent but probably a little bit too sweet lol   Service seems unaware at first when we got there. We waited probably 10mins untill someone realized we were there in an empty restaurant around 1pm."}
{"text":"I always go here for bubble tea and just to chill late night with friends since it is usually open late. I sometimes get food and this time I tried fish fillet w/ rice. Portion size was decent in my opinion. Also tried their popcorn chicken which i thought was alright. I also really enjoy their drinks and have tried their green teas, milk teas and slushes. The prices are a bit on the pricey side but can't get enough of buying bubble tea from them!! Oh and they also have free wifi!"}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --  This is the 3rd bubble tea place at the Birchmount/ Enterprise Rd Intersection (the other 2 bbt places are Chatime and Teashop 168). Game is on! I am glad that there's finally a new Go For Tea close to where I live. The interior was very dark. Orange and wood was the colour and decor theme of the store. When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by the server and was brought to our table right away. The store was very spacious and I liked how they had a high ceiling.   -- Food and Drink --  We ordered 4 items in total:  1. Beef Udon Noodle Nabeyaki $12.99 - The udon soup was placed in a stone bowl, which made the food sizzling hot! The quantity was huge for me. The soup was very soothing and was on the sweeter end. Aside from the beef and udon, it also came with 2 pieces of Kamaboko, a poached egg, kelp and scallions. I liked how the udon was very soft and chewy.   2. Popcorn Chicken With Rice $10.99 - I was quite shocked a popcorn chicken on rice cost $10.99. Given the competition for Taiwanese food in Markham is so high, the price kinda pushed me away. However, I thought the food quality was actually on par. The chicken was not overly salty and was very crispy and not oily at all. I liked how they used round rice. The stir-fried egg and tomato was very tasty. It also came with three spring rolls on the side.   3. Strawberry Black Tea Large with Tapioca $6.79 ($0.80 extra for tapioca and $1.00 extra to upgrade to a large size) - Their tapioca is the softest and most chewy in Markham. Their large drinks were actually a lot bigger than Chatime/ Coco. I liked how their Strawberry black tea actually had some very tiny strawberry bits in it. Loved the flavor and the texture a lot!   4. Peach Black Tea $4.99 - I liked how their drinks are not very sweet (I ordered 100% sugar) which was perfect! The peach flavor had a very strong scent.   -- Overall -- I like this location a lot. There's plenty of items on the menu! I will revisit this place in the near future!"}
{"text":"This place has been here a while, but it still holds up to today's standards for food and decor.  When this place was first built, I thought it looked great inside.  Even though the furniture and washrooms inside have suffered some serious wear and tear over the years it still looks pretty grand.  Probably because the dark lighting covers up most of the flaws, but it works nicely for a bubble tea lounge to go for some drinks.  The bubble tea here isn't anything special, in fact it's similar to what you would get at Destiny nearby.  Most of it is powder mixes and they don't really use fresh fruit for their slush/smoothies.  I usually get a taro smoothie and it tastes just like it would anywhere else around the area.  Nothing more or nothing less.  The food however is a bit better than most bubble tea shops around.  They actually have a full menu with many noodle bowl, tapas, hot pot and dessert options.  When I'm hungry I'm definitely down for their fried chicken noodles or bbq eel rice!  Go for tea is a very chill place to grab a drink and hang out with some friends.  The food is also good and the service and staff are a bit better than what you would expect from a place like Destiny.  I'll be back again if I'm in the area and craving a plate of popcorn chicken!"}
{"text":"Drinks are pretty expensive!  I guess that's the premium you pay to have access to magazines and to chill in a dark, lounge-like atmosphere.    We were charged for an order of condensed milk toast and we didn't even order it. I asked the server to check and she said one of our friends, who had already left, ordered it.  I asked our friend, she didn't.    Whatever.  It's an Asian place so honestly, if you complain, they won't do anything anyways.    I liked sitting in the private room though.  That was kinda cool.   No need to come back here!"}
{"text":"Sometimes beautiful decor with comfortable lounging doesn't necessarily mean that you are going to have a great time. I went here twice and the service was terrible, Go For Tea is rather a hotspot for your friends to socialize for hours and hours and don't mind how long the drinks and food going to arrive.   The first time that I came here, no one greeted me at the door and so I just walked in and sit myself to a seat. I also took awhile for a waitress to come over to give me the menu even though I called the waitress over after having no waitress where I sat. Although at that time I was going to read and finish a 400 page book that seems like a great idea considering how bad the service is.   I ordered a large apple black tea with tapioca which took long enough but it's pretty good, considering that Go For Tea specializes in drinks but with the food, it's terrible and expensive. I swear that the prices for the cakes is a ripoff, five dollars for a small slice of cake that is probably not fresh and probably stored-brought.   The only plus side for this terrible place is the decor and the moody music that is often relaxing."}
{"text":"Great spot to hang out and chill simply because they have so much space. So if you're looking for a spot to do work or a project without waiters  disturbing you, this is the place to be. There are always people on their laptops in the booths. You can also play board games there (bring your own games) except when it's a weekend.   Service here is crummy. The waiters never make eye contact with you and walk away from your table as you're finishing your order. Everything you order is tossed onto your table regardless if it's a drink or food. If you have a big table with only 2-3 people, they sometimes put your food at the furthest edge (most convenient place for them) and you have to move the plates yourself. There's also a service Bell you can ring but the waiters are slow at responding and sometimes they ignore it.   The portion sizes are fairly large depending on what your ordering. The dinner specials give you pretty good bang for your buck but the price of BBT is much higher than other places (& not as good).   This location is large and is great for any size group. However, the biggest downfall for this place is the service which falls way short of the average standard."}
{"text":"Why is this place still in business? It seems like they've given up since other bbt joints in the area opened and flourished, especially after their new location in dt Markham opened. Sad place."}
{"text":"Here service suck shit.... one of the waitress name LuLu and try to using her other staff name on the bill, when she getting her bill here just throwing the bills on the table when we ask for separate bills nicely, I was like wtf..."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Horrible service. Wanted to order one of their drink but was told that they don't have it. I asked for the menu and wanted to show her what I wanted to order, the server then said they have a different name for this drink. Also when I was paying my bill, she didn't say thank you or anything. All she asked was do you need the machine."}
{"text":"Great ambiance?  Check.  Attentive, friendly service?  Check.  Tasty drink?  Yes.  Over-priced bubbletea drinks in an extensive menu?  Yup, got that too.  I usually roll my eyes a little at myself whenever I got to bubbletea places because it is rare that I feel that I am getting much value out of the product, and service is usually spotty due to the popularity of these places.  This time, the service was spot on and the drinks arrived in a timely manner served in proper bubbletea-ware (not plastic!).  While the drinks were standard, the friendly and quick service in combination with the great lounge-like ambiance provided a positive experience.  The music is kept at a level where you don't have to shout to be heard.  The washroom corridor is like walking into a hallway of mirrors - interesting design and a must wander for every narcissist.  Love the rounded benches that allow for intimate and cozy conversation without feeling too crowded.  There's an interesting selection of meals, snacks and desserts too.  It's a great location to catch up with friends!"}
{"text":"Came here late at night, glad to see it was open. Situated in downtown Markham, I wouldn't say this one establishment stands out and is the best of all the surrounding restaurants nearby. For the Taiwanese/Hong Kong style fusion cuisine they serve, it is honestly sub par and frankly, a little more expensive than other restaurants of the same calibre. I wasn't super impressed with the Thai Chicken which was simply just fried chicken covered in a bland and cheap sweet and spicy sauce. As well, the BBQ eel lacked any sustance and flavour. Overall, all the rice that accompanied the different dishes was extremely dry and quite cold; like it had been sitting out, getting stale versus kept warm and fresh in a rice cooker. Drinks are quite overpriced, considering there is a Cha Time nearby and were not special in any manner. Not super impressed with service as our order was completely forgotten and not ordered until 15 minutes after our initial order."}
{"text":"Never coming back to this place.  Basically pay to receive sh*t attitude. Been to this restaurant three times, first time was fine for a take out it was okay, other two times was dine in and lemme tell you I rather been home with instant noodles.   The last time was the last straw for it.  Had to ask for water to be served, since we have nothing even after we placed our order ... Asked for a sauce which was suppose to be with a dish, but never got the sauce even after the meal :) k... The waters also had a face like we owe them money or something, I mean I thought putting a light smile was like a minimal respect towards you customer?  For that time I  was with a few friends. So I told the waiter five person in Chinese, he responded me \"excuse me\" as if he couldn't understand Chinese, okay, I know not everyone speaks fluent Chinese so I replied in English. After being seated, the guy also approached us using English.  At that point I'll take it as he is more fluent in English, since my friends also tried to speak Chinese to the guy but he kept his responses in English, so everyone of us decided to speak English to him. But later on, when something was wrong with the order, he came to our table and started speaking Chinese?!? FLUENT CHINESE may I add. Dafuq, so you pretend you don't understand Chinese and purposely spoke English to my friends who obviously speaks Chinese better as they were talking with another waitress influent Chinese , wow how considerate lol. Trust me, it's not just because he wasn't considerate or whatever, it was also his attitude that pissed my off."}
{"text":"It's a great place for late-night dessert. I've had some good teas and desserts here. However the last time I visited, I ordered a creme brulee and it was hot in some places and cold in others like if it was disproportionately heated. The other things we ordered- blueberry cheesecake, very mango slushee and tapioca black tea- were all very good."}
{"text":"A satisfying bubbletea experience!  This place is spacious with modern bubbletea house decor.  There's usually a line up late at night and it's great for groups if you come early enough.  The sugar water that we call bubbletea are of good quality and served in proper glass cups.  The food here is pretty good - I had tofu with seafood on an iron plate served with rice and it definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"I really like coming here with my friends because it is in the middle of everyone so its easy to get to. This go for tea is a great place for dates as well because the lighting is pretty dim, which is nice. It can get pretty loud when it gets busy but that is to be expected of a bubble tea place.  Washrooms are also very nice because you get your own room with a sink and hand dryer. There is also a \"party room\" if you have a large group of friends. Use the buzzer if you are in that room because staff normally doesn't check up on you.   Open wifi is available but the connection is pretty slow when busy. Prices for bubble tea and food is pretty average. I recommend their popcorn chicken if you are hungry, it is really good. They also offer a selection of cakes but not all of them will be available at the same time."}
{"text":"This place is a good spot to come to with groups as they have intimate sections if you have group gatherings.  My girls and I were put in a secluded corner and able to be as loud as we wanted.  The servers were nice but I didn't like that when we ordered something, one of the guys would like be wanting to walk away while we were ordering or peering through the side of the wall.  Also, it's neat they had a buzzer to call the servers and they would come to our table quick.  Bubble tea was ok, I got honeydew slush and it was pretty sweet.  The food was okay, quite salty but it wasn't horrible.  The highlight of the day...CREME BRÛLÉE!!   Overall, an okay place to go, not completely horrible...customer service could be more friendly but they were quick and efficient.  Oh and just an FYI...if you get seated in the back, the layout of the restaurant is really confusing.  My friends and I felt like we were walking in circles lol"}
{"text":"This place is overpriced, and the food/drinks arent noticeably well done either. For the price they charge you'd expect way more. The two waiters we had were incredibly impatient and kept giving us the stink eye."}
{"text":"I really liked the interior design and the ambiance of this location. Seating was comfortable as well and you don't need to chase down service since they have a bell installed near all the tables. But the food and drinks were average at best and it's much pricier for what it's worth. Parking is a hit or miss depending if you're coming during a weekday or weekend.  Came on a Saturday night to hang out and decided to get some dessert. We ordered the tiramisu, raspberry almond pistachio mousse, grape slush, and toffee apple cheesecake.  Tiramisu- this was decent. Plated nicely and tasted good  Raspberry almond pistachio mousse- this was the best of the three cakes. I would get this if I came back  Grape slush- it's like a grape flavored 7 eleven slushee in a large glass  Toffee apple cheesecake- this was okay. It was my least favorite of the desserts  Overall, this is a cool place to chill with friends and I really liked the interior of the place. However, it's not the place to find a good value or a good meal. I won't be suggesting others to come back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really big with lots of seating and the lighting is very dim. Pros: They have plugs at almost every table, good for using laptops. Their menu is very big, they have a lot of food and drinks to choose from. Lots of different bubble teas. Cons: Waitresses don't really care about you, if you don't call them over they won't come to take your order or refill water or get you the bill. (But that could also be a good thing because they don't care how long you stay there for) Food and drinks are pretty overpriced. Portions of the food were decent, flavours were good but not great. I don't think it's worth the price tbh. The large sized drinks are really huge, so it kind of makes sense that it's almost $7. They have 4 different jellies: lychee, mango, passionfruit, green apple. The passionfruit jellies are REALLY sour do not recommend. The mango jellies taste kind of weird. Green apple jellies are pretty good.  Overall, it's a nice place to hangout for a long period of time, but I wouldn't come here for a quick drink or meal."}
{"text":"Really nice little spot with many options for meals, snacks, drinks and dessert. My friends and I grabbed bubble tea and cakes - all received as shown in the pictures and within reasons time! Service is made simpler by proving a call button and they responded within a minute!! Definitely a repeat place :)"}
{"text":"The only thing that keeps me coming back here are the drinks.  When I usually walk into this place it makes me feel that it's a crime to be friendly.  The waitresses are in their own zone following their daily routine, I guess trying to be as less friendly as possible?  Doesn't make sense at all.  I understand that is a Tea house with mediocure dinner sets, but personally, I think the waitresses really ruin the mood for this place.  The interior is dark but really neat looking, the music they play is really good, (not like a club, just over the speakers)  and the drinks are really good.  My 2 favourite mixes are:  Rose Slush with Lychee Jelly, and Peppermint green tea with Pinapple jelly or Tapioca.  I highly recommend the Rose drink because its more universal than the peppermint, but both of those mixes are goooooooddddd.  Prices are really good too, the drinks are massive and the prices are not.  So there you go lol its a good ratio.   So final verdict?  If your looking to be left alone by the staff and ignore their gloominess, great place for drinks and socializing with friends.  However, if you would like a little more friendly and upbeat decore with a sociable staff, this is a place you can avoid.  Enjoy  Follow me on Twitter: @slidewaysclutch"}
{"text":"ONE OF THE WORST RESTAURANTS EVER.  Went there for dinner before my movie started and I think this Go For Tea is one of my least favorite restaurants.  1. After we sat down, they DIDN'T give us any water at all. I really don't understand. Isn't it supposed to be something that customers don't need to ask for? I was thirsty so i complained about it and then one of the waiters brought ONE glass of water(we have two people) and put it down in front me. He didn't say sorry or anything.   2. When we were ordering, the waitress who took our order was having a \"whatever\" face and her tone was totally impatient and kinda annoyed.   3. We ordered a roasted corn, stir fried lotus, spicy sesame chicken and hot ginger tea. The corn is okay and i kinda like it. Stir fried lotus is too salty and the portion is not worth 11 dollars at all. Spicy sesame chicken is totally disgusting: the meat is not even fully cooked. When we were eating, we could still see some red part inside the chicken meat. Also the spicy sesame sauce is SO SALTY that it was unbearable.   4. It was 35 dollars for the four things we ordered. Plus tips, it was 40 dollars. NOT WORTH IT.   I'll never go back there again."}
{"text":"Good food but horrible horrible service. Servers just like to pretend not seeing you ask for service. We waved so many times and even press the button that use to request service, no one even come. They all have time to chit chat with each other but have no time to work. Then why come to work? They are also Not very polite when they serve, feels like people own them money. If there is a no star option I will most definitely give that for the service.  It is a good place to chill but the service made it the worst place to go."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great, either. They have a good selection of teas and bubble teas, but I found the service a bit lacking (we had to ask a couple times for cutlery) and the food was so-so.  I probably won't be back again."}
{"text":"It looks and has the spacious interior of a classy restaurant, yet feels like a bubble tea joint you could study in for hours.   Another unique feature compared to other bubble tea places is the very extensive food menu, which is pretty good but a tiny bit over priced for the portion you get. The quality of the food is good enough that I wasn't bothered by it.   Overall, I think it's superior in many ways to other bubble tea places, because of the menu and ambiance."}
{"text":"Best words to describe Go For Tea, mediocre food and terrible service. Doesn't matter if you come in on a busy night or dead night, you know service is terrible when you have a button that prompt service to the table.   Food: Literally the only reason why anyone comes here. Dining experience to have a meal set and stone. I'll say it again though, mediocre food at best, basically your run of the mill Taiwanese McDonald's but without the value like at Papa Chang's. However they are open late into the night so if you have food cravings, this is a option available.  Service: If you tell me service is good then you must be trolling. Staff definitely do not care about their jobs or at the very least extremely inexperienced which confuses me that a manager of this place would want to encourage better service to maximize the amount of revenue coming into the business. I digress.   Ambiance: Nicely renovated with comfortable seating which makes this a good spot to loiter around and hangout with company.   Recommendation: Go here for late night cravings if you want, I still think there are better places to satisfy your hunger."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to have lunch here and while the decor and ambiance was great, I have a few comments to make in reference to my overall experience here.  I came to this location at 1:30pm this afternoon and while there were a few parties it was not exceptionally busy.  I was expecting to be seated quickly, but I had to wait for roughly ten minutes before someone had even greeted me at the door.   When I was finally seated, I looked through the menu as I waited for my friends to join me.  Since a few of our friends were running late, I decided to order food first.  I ordered a popcorn chicken with rice (a bit too salty in my mind) and two glasses of hot water for my friend and I.  Fifteen minutes rolled around, and the water still hadn't arrived...so my friend asked a different waiter for water and he took his time to bring one glass (and not two) of hot water for the two of us.  As soon as our other friends arrived, they looked through the menu to place their orders.  Thirty minutes rolled around and no one cared to check on us and see if we wanted to make an order.  I had to stand up and flag a waiter down to take our orders.  By this time, I had to ask for a glass of water for a second time, which took them another 20 minutes to bring to me.  I'm not disappointed with the quality of food and drinks, but I was rather disappointed in the service that the wait staff had provided.  Wait time took a little long, the staff took a while before they cared to take our orders, the staff didn't seem to remember the drinks we ordered (\"grape and blueberry bbt looks similar in colour.  Have a sip and let me know if it tastes like what you ordered\") and didn't take much responsibility over their jobs.  What really pushed me to write this review was that during the lengthy wait time to be served, my friends and I noticed that there were at least three wait staff on the floor/in the area chatting in a little corner while ignoring their customers.   If we came here during a peak-free time and received this type of service, what would the service be like during peak hours?"}
{"text":"Might as well go for tea as nobody hurts, and nobody cries Might as well go for tea as nobody drowns and nobody dies It makes me thirst for love.  While it's true nobody else cries or dies, I cry a little from the attitude the servers all provide.  If I didn't know any better, I'd think they were getting trained to do a little turn on the catwalk, yeah on the cat walk, but seriously they're not sexy enough to be right, said Fred.  I also die a little for how much they charge for powdered water.    But alas, fobbie Asian kiddies need places to hang out, and you can't Karaoke every night.   Plus they might break a nail if they went bowling every other night, and that's just the guys.  The interesting décor, has as much attitude as the servers."}
{"text":"Yesterday night, my friends and I had drinks here after work. They wanted bubble tea, and this location was the closest and most \"baby friendly\" because one of my  chicas needed to bring her little bundle of joy along. It was late when everyone arrived, so most of my clique ordered dinner along with bubble tea. The food menu is more geared towards the conventional Asian, meaning meat eaters, but they do have 3 meatless, eggless, \"milk-less\" dishes. So one of my girls (she's not vegan) and I shared 2 of the 3: the garlic tofu and sweet potato fries.  The tofu was delicately fried, not greasy, not hard and had a good texture. The soy sauce / garlic sauce mix that was drizzled on top was good, although we had to ask them for more because the tofu came with so little. All in all, the tofu was satisfactory, nothing spectacular, nothing I haven't had before. In fact, I think it's a bit overpriced, but it's kind of expected at this type of establishment: they specialize in drinks, not really food... and the food they do have is very average and not worth the money.   The sweet potato fries were more like sweet potato tempura with pepper sprinkled on top. It was ok, nothing special, although I must admit I wasn't expecting them to batter their sweet potatoes before deep frying it. I really wasn't crazy about the extra batter because that means extra calories that I will have to lose or not eat.  I had to ask them to bring ketchup and hot sauce, I thought the former would be obvious... cos really, who eats fries plain? It's so dry!  My favourite was the drink I'd ordered, which is what I always order when I come here because they can't really screw it up: the hot ginger black tea with tapioca. The only way they could possibly screw this drink up is if they served it lukewarm, which is why I always request them to make it extra hot. I love hot bubble tea with tapioca, there's something intriguing about a half-melted tapioca ball.  The service here really sucks. When we were waiting for everyone to arrive, the waiters kept pestering us and hawking our table. But when we were finally ready to order, they were no where to be found. It took them long to bring us the extra sauces for the tofu and sweet potato fries, although they were pretty quick with getting us the bill. What also frustrated me was that the waiters don't understand Cantonese, yet they also seem to not understand English either. Honestly, when you're serving the Scarborough population and when most of us are English or Cantonese speakers, it really makes sense to have a working knowledge of either language.  Regardless of their less than stellar performance, my friends and I still had a great time catching up over food and drinks. I'll come back, I always do, it's just a convenient place to meet with some of my friends who hate going downtown for better drink and food establishments, namely the non-franchises! I really am not a big fan of franchised restaurants... way too cookie-cutter and ordinary."}
{"text":"Come here if you plan on spending hours catching up with a friend or working on a project. The ambiance and interior decorations are amazing. However, the food is not as good as their previous location in Richmond Hill, and their service is even worse (if you can imagine that). The do have a bell for you to ring but they don't seem to respond to it at all. The staff also seem to lack common sense (bringing us 2 plates for appetizers for 6 people). Drinks are also overpriced."}
{"text":"Like a lot of other Taiwanese places, this place has both teas and meal dishes. I didn't find the food to be anything special and there was nothing bad either. The tea are better than your average shops like 168 and similar to Cha Time.   The decor is really nice and it's designed for people to hang out and chat. In fact, that should be your primary purpose for coming here. If you want good Taiwanese food or bubble tea, surely you can find a cheaper option. Next time I do a date or a fun group meeting, I would consider this place. It can get a bit loud but still ok for chatting."}
{"text":"This place is pretty similar to destiny, the only difference would be that this place has the paper hot pot :) which is pretty cool, I would highly recommend it, however for the last few times when I ordered their popcorn chicken... I got sick the very next day... So I wouldn't suggest getting that"}
{"text":"I've visited this place a few times, and for all those that are coming here with high expectations for the bubble tea, either lower your expectations immediately or go to a different tea shop.  From my experiences, I can't speak on behalf of the food, but dessert and bubble tea wise... Well let's just say that there are way better cafes in the area that are actually worth your time and money.  The bubble tea here is always either too sweet, too bland, or too sour. I recall trying a friend's mango slush and it just tasted so bland as if the baristas did not add any sweetener or what not to the drink - the $5-6 drink tasted like something that I'd pay less than a buck for.  I remember trying their green apple slush and man it was so sour I couldn't even finish it. I've tried the green apple slushs from numerous tea shops and I can honestly say that the one I had here was the absolute worst. And the tapioca, don't even get me started. It was way too chewy, soft, and undeniably undercooked - again, it did not have the sweet taste that it was supposed to have.   As for the location, it is located near central downtown Markham; pretty easy to find but minimal parking space especially on Friday nights and weekends. For the interior decor, it has a chill atmosphere with dim lights and a more trendy feel that newer cafes seem to opt for. They also have private rooms for groups which are good for gatherings and parties.   Service was mediocre - nothing particularly special. Waiters are bilingual in both Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese) and also English. You'll find that there are those table buttons that are used to signal the waiters, which is something more common in asian restaurants/cafes nowadays.  Overall an average experience in regards to the bubble tea and desserts. Haven't tried their food but based on the other reviews here I don't think I ever will."}
{"text":"Go For Tea - we have a love-hate relationship... I go there because coffee gets boring after awhile, and I want to change it up... Every time I come back I have this undying hope that I will be greeted with a smile, and that they will have put their staff through some sort of ESL program... but every time I come back, I end up more and more disappointed.  While the decor of the place is very loft-like with its high ceilings and comfy couches... The cold stares, lax attention to customers, and lack of effort turns me off.    Met up with Dopey today after work as he had just gotten home from a trip and there was lots to catch up on.  It was relatively empty as it seems the rich Chinese kids who drive the Mercedes and BMWs sponsored by mom and dad only come out to play at 9PM or later.  There was no hostess at the front, and it felt like I was playing \"Where's Waldo?\" before I finally spotted a server who assumed we spoke the mother tongue (which has gone from Cantonese now to Mandarin).    We chose a seat and the menus were brought shortly after.  With minimum wage being what now, $10 I wish they would smile more often.  I used to work for $6.85 (yeah, remember those days?) and even I was more cheery than that!  If it weren't for a lack of options in Scarborough, I would probably never come back again... But unfortunately, I always end up here, and have to put up with the misery that is Go For Tea, over and over, and over again... My stars keep going down... I really do hope that the next review I write is not a 1 star."}
{"text":"overall the location was really nice. Love the decor and the food. The down side. Service was terrible. Took over half an hour for our 2 drinks and food. I guess I have high expectations, but I would have expected the servers to come and see how we were doing at least once. Thank goodness the food and drinks was good. I would come back if I was invited to go."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by here for some pre-dinner bubble tea hahaha. It was my first time coming here. The decor and the overall ambience of the restaurant looks quite pretty. The menu is has a good selection of taiwanese food and bubble teas to choose from. There's not that many desserts compared to other asian dessert places.  I went with the regular (500ML) mango milk tea for $5.99 which wasn't bad but it's a bit on the pricy side. It is +$1 for upsize of 200ML and +$1 for any toppings. My drink came in a decent amount of time, but not all the food came at once which was kind of awkward for our dining experience.  The tea tasted good, but it tastes more like juice than tea. It was still a refreshing drink and I don't regret ordering it. The service is fine too, it's a bit slow but I understand it can be hard to keep track of everything especially with the vast size of the restaurant. I would may be come here again to try some of the food but it's not my first choice."}
{"text":"In protest of the lousy service that I've experienced at the Go For Tea in Scarborough, I decided to drive a bit further to their Richmond Hill location.  I do not mind driving the distance if it means that I'm less irritated on my way home about the horrible food experience.  This location is much bigger, although parking is not as plentiful as the Scarborough counterpart and you have to compete with patrons who share the lot with a plaza that is also home to a Baton Rouge.    I ended up scoring a sweet parking spot that I am surprised was not reserved as a Handicap spot because of its proximity to the front entrance, but I shall shut up and count my blessings!  We were promptly seated.  It appears that the employees hired at this location have a working knowledge on their English.  About 2 minutes after we were seated, our server came by to take our order.  I ordered a Honey Green Tea to nurse my undying cough, and Boyfriend ordered the Coffee Milk Tea.    We lingered for about another hour longer after we finished our respective drinks, and I was surprised when a server brought us glasses of water.    For once, I can say that I have found a bubble tea establishment that has quality service worth mentioning.    They also do not set a password on their wi-fi which means that you can start surfing the moment you walk in the door.  The Scarborough location requires a password... I could crack a Scarborough joke, but I really don't think I need to add to the list of ever-growing Scarborough jokes that already exist."}
{"text":"After dinner, we were in the mood for dessert and since it was getting late we used our Yelp App to look for a place that was open.  Go For Tea stays open till 3 am Mon-Sun. Upon entering, we noticed how nice the interior was. It's dark and looks more like a club. Seating is comfortable and can accommodate groups. Their menu is extensive. They offer soups, variety of entrees, desserts, drinks and snacks. We enjoyed all of our drinks and desserts. The teas were on point. Their fruit flavored teas tasted natural and the tapioca had a nice consistency. Prices are OK.  Service needs great improvement. From the moment we entered, the hostess was quite rude and appeared as if she hated being there. Our server was not attentive. Our group needed spoons, napkins and our check but had to get up a few times to look for him.   Go For Tea offers delicious treats and the ambiance is great. Something needs to be done about the service."}
{"text":"I tend to prefer Go For Tea over .... Destiny. Lol. There, I said it! Mainly because it seems that they have a bigger menu selection and a bigger variety of drinks here. And they accept all sorts of payment methods - debit, credit and cash, whereas Destiny only accepts CASH. Lol and they have this fresh fruit/vege drinks section.. I usually get the \"Tomato with Honey Juice\", I think its called. Its supposed to help reduce dark circles around the eyes and improve blood circulation. Lol anything that helps with my panda eyes!!! But yeah it doesn't taste bad either.   Oh Btw they have buzzers on the tables to page the wait staff..."}
{"text":"I believe this place has so much potential! The restaurant is spacious, clean and has a very neat modern design. The only problem is the service. I came here for lunch on a weekend with three other friends and it was decently filled. We were seated and given the menus, but it took a while before the waitress came back to take our orders. After we ordered, we waited around 45 minutes for the first order to come, and then the rest of our dishes came slowly one at a time. Luckily, I had some great company with me so the wait didn't feel as long as it took. (Tip: come here prepared with lots of table topics.)  I ordered the stewed beef with vermicelli in soup ($11.99). The beef was tender and the soup was very flavorful, it was definitely a good amount of food for lunch. I was thirsty after finishing it but the servers do not come over to refill waters unless you ask them to, and it was always difficult getting a hold of someone. I don't think I'll be returning here for a while because I feel like you can find similar food elsewhere for better service and better prices. However, I think if they improve their service, the experience would be so much better since they have such a nice place and good chefs/cooks!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for a group of friends to hangout/eat/study/homework. The food is meh. I had the dice beef rice combo and the soup was cold... the meat was good though. It can be expensive depending on what you get. Their drinks are over $4 average. The service wasn't great... they don't refill your cup of water unless you ask. The atmosphere is pretty relaxing. I would go back here to hangout with a group of friends I haven't seen in awhile."}
{"text":"Wow, I haven't been back here for over 5 years, and I don't know what happened to it.  I used to come here almost every weekend since it opened and it was the only alternative to a bar that was big enough to hold our big group. This used to be the place to be.  But since this visit, I won't be back.   It was the middle of the day, the place was moderately busy, definitely not like a packed Friday/Saturday night. Our group had about 10 people, we were at a wedding and had 4 hours to kill before the reception. I had thought of here because we could just plop ourselves and play cards.   When we sat down, it was about half and hour we realized that there was no menus given to us. Just as I got up to the front to get some, the guy came by and asked us for our order, and there I am standing there with a pile of menus. Awkward.  The food choices for lunch is diverse, but at a price point neither too cheap or too expensive. It's affordable, but knowing Chinatown prices, you'd rather go there.  The difference between here and say, Congee Queen, is that CQ for the same price can get you a large shared portion for maybe about 3 people. Here, everything is individual (western style) It is also very blatant that they covered old prices ($8.99) and increased to ($9.99 and up).   I got the Spicy Beef Noodle (Hong Siu) $9.99 - it was same old. nothing special, good, not amazing. It's one of my favourite taiwanese dishes. Some others got a rice/black bean beef bbq.   What is nice for a long sit down period of time is the bubble tea. However, the prices are decieving. For $3.99 or $4.99 you can get a small, but if you want a large the small print says and extra $1 and for jelly or tapioca is $.50. Basically a large drink is $$6.50 which is quite  pricy.   The worst part was the service. Food came out the oddest times, and in the weirdest order. The foods were hardly correct and we had to send a few back. At one point, a bowl of noodles was left at our table and it didn't belong to us.  Doing the bill, they had offered us to mark down who had what and do separate bills - even that they screwed up.   Also what was disheartening, was the dirty tables, underneath. One of the tables had sticky food or something underneath. My friend got his SILK tie and shirt dirty by sitting too close. I was moving the tables and grossness was on my hands and got on my dress.   Ick. Next time we're going to Destiny's or the new Ten Rens that opened up down the street."}
{"text":"First time here, and the last time here. Came here with a friend, hoping to share something but apparently everyone has to order at least one item on the menu. Geez. Once we got in, the atmosphere was horrible. We waited at least 5 mins to be seated yet there was at lest 3/4 of tables left to be filled. We were seated on one of the booth seats near the window. No tables were served with water or napkins or any utensils at all. Poor setting. smh. We had to press a button to all over the waitresses and throughout the entire dinner, the button was not working. Bad, bad, bad service.The waiters were terrible, quiet and all full of attitude. One of them said something that I couldn't hear so I was like \"pardon?\" and he didn't answer me and he proceeded to climb onto the booth, reaching to close the blinds. In my mind I was like \"what the hell is he doing climbing onto my seat, so close to me?!\" I just brushed it off and continued to look at the menu. Everything was super hella expensive. We wanted to get friend spring rolls so we ordered that but the waiter said that they don't serve friend spring rolls anymore. At least 1/4 of the menu, has spring rolls served with it!! So in the end, we ordered the fried rice with taiwanese sausage (I asked for no green onions since I'm allergic) then we got forced to ordered another item so we ordered the popcorn chicken snack. The popcorn chicken came first and was very quick. Then the napkins and utensils came. Though the taste was very good, there were some pieces that had a lot of bone in it. Didn't even have a place that I could have spit it out onto so I had to privately spit it out onto my napkin. 5 or so mins past and the rice came out. Very disappointed. There were green onions on it after I specifically told them to not include it!! It took at least 2 mins to get a waiters attention and once I told them about my problem, they said \"hold on\" and just left. A sad 5mins past again and another waitress came and asked \"what's wrong?\", I told them the same thing and she just grabbed my bowl and left. We started eating the popcorn chicken and the rice didn't come back out for another 20minutes!! The rice came back but there was no spoon. Once we got the spoon, there were no bowls for my friend and I to share so we had to pour the rice onto small plates we got and eat with forks. There was no point of asking anymore because it'll take 10 more minutes for them to bring it out. We wanted to get some water throughout the meal so we kept pressing the order button but it was not working AT ALL. We were raising our hands to call out the waiters but none of them came to us. Some even looked at us but just ignored. There were three waitresses, THREE, clearing up ONE small table. I was very upset to see that none of them wanted to help us even though we got their attention. When we finally got their attention and reviewed the water, the glasses were tiny!! TINY!!! Probably finished in 2 sips.   Never going to come back here. No tip left. Worst restaurant ever. I PRAY THAT YOU DONT COME HERE!!"}
{"text":"I used to go there all the time .and after a while i found that they changed the menu and the price has increased quite a bit.i tried to order honey green tea but they gave me something else instead .good thing that they changed it back for me .the food was ok but not the same as before ."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to bubble tea in Toronto in 1998 so when I returned here last month I knew I had to have some. My pal Yves obliged me and drove me to Go For Tea.   I was initially overwhelmed by the grand space and the endless menu options. Barley embryo, fresh watermelon juice, yogurt with aloe. . .  After perusing way too long we got the brownie cheesecake to share and I had the peppermint green tea with tapioca - two choices I was quite pleased with.  Sort of makes me wish I had a Go For Tea in New York."}
{"text":"I decided that my experience at Midland/McNicholGo 4 Tea was so poor that I purposely made an account just to write a review on them. I have about normal standards where I expect pretty good food at a pretty good price matched with pretty good service.  This is based on my first experience and likely last at this location. I was in the VIP room at a table of 8 at around dinner time on a Saturday.   I don't believe a VIP room (or a segregated section) is just a room or section that needs to be reserved. I think there should be more to it then that, mainly in the customer service area where waiters/waitresses have more experience at their job, have a good attitude and possess at least good communication skills.   Everything was okay (meaning not that good) until it was time for the bills which then turned worse. My waitress didn't appear to be sure what was ordered (and certainly didn't know who ordered what) because she walked to our table a couple times with the bills. On the final walk over, she simply handed the bill to one of us and had us sort it out ourselves. When she came back with our change she simply laid it out on the table and again had us sort it out ourselves. I can understand that she doesn't remember who ordered what but when it comes to bill time, she shouldn't have just casually laid it out on the table. I don't think its the customer's responsibility to sort out who has the correct receipt.  Additionally, I was billed for a wrong and slightly more expensive drink. (I won't blame a person whose bad at a second language but if that's the case, they must be crystal clear about what's being ordered to minimize confusion). Anyway, I reluctantly paid for it to avoid the argument so I was not pleased.  We then decided to play some games at the table and so we had to have the table cleared. We had a waiter approach us without mentioning what we needed and when we told him we wanted the table cleared, he looked quite upset and rude and quietly took away some of our dishes (not all of them but he didn't return for it). He did not mention one word to us (\"how may I help you\", \"sure, I can take these away\" etc).  While the food was pretty good (a bit on the expensive side though, I don't mind the price. But every restaurant should have at least pretty good customer service. The customer service at this location was crap and for that alone, I wouldn't go back. Similarly, if a restaurant has excellent food but the worst customer service, I'd never go there again either. Good customer service can go a long way.  The only reason I rated Go 4 Tea two stars is because I liked the decor and the food was pretty good otherwise it would have earn a one star from me."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time but I haven't been here in 5-6 months.  What can I say about this place? It's your typical bubble tea cafe, where the focus is on drinks and the food is a bit of an afterthought.    I've gotten the fried rice and noodles before and they were so salty, I couldn't stand to finish the plate.  And if you know me, no matter if I like the food or not, I try my darndest to clean a plate.    As for the drinks, I think they are pretty good. My favourite is the hot taro milk black tea.  It has a strong taro taste and quite sweet and it makes an excellent dessert.    Verdict: Service is a bit lacking, food is mediocre at best, but this is a great place to chill and have a few desserts and dessert drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Go for tea, go for food, go for ambiance, go for value. Actually, I think going for tea should be low on your list of priorities when visiting Go For Tea. It's very average, and like all bubble tea, extremely overpriced.   However, everything else is pretty fantastic. Stepping inside is like stepping into some modern art gallery. The interior is really comfortable, with high ceilings and very adequate spacing. The owner has really stepped it up a notch. Not that the old Go For Tea wasn't nice, this place is just much, much nicer. I mean, look at that tree in the middle of the restaurant! It's beautiful!!!  The value for the food you get is also spectacular. I went on Sunday around 2 and luckily they were still serving their lunch combos. I got the golden curry seafood rice combo which comes with:   1) Surprisingly tasty and coconut-y curry with a good amount of seafood (choice of that, chicken, or beef) and veggies. Also comes with a big bowl of rice.   2) A pair of crispy spring rolls.  3) Small, refreshing salad.  4) A very neutral soup. If you've had traditional Chinese soup, it's like that, but with barely any salt. That doesn't mean it wasn't flavourful. It had very strong hints of clear chicken broth and shitake mushrooms.  5) A creamy panna cotta-like thing with mango puree, which I was actually a very big fan of.   All of this for $12.99! What?? (Even cheaper on weekdays at $10.99) My brother got the Taiwanese popcorn chicken with rice and that came in a generous portion with spring rolls as well ($10.99). They've got a really extensive menu, all of which is at a reasonable price (except the drinks, of course, but I guess that's where they really make a profit).   I am REALLY loving this cheap eats, classy environment thing that is going on. Go for tea, stay for everything else is what I say! Well done on the very successful reopening!   (61/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"Service as usual was abysmal.  There is honestly so much attitude from the servers at Go for Tea everytime I come here and I don't understand why.  The food was okay.  I can only get the smoked salmon fried rice now after becoming pescatarian, but I used to always get the afternoon special of popcorn chicken and yam fries before.    Bubble tea is quite good however, the tapioca balls are sweet and chewy and the peach black tea is consistently good.    Still service is always lacking. I must say they need to have better management or else I will continually tip poorly."}
{"text":"This place is very nice when you walk in. We had a table for 10 and it was in a private area. The drink were very good and the food is really good. We also had the dessert and the cake is amazing. I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Just so no one thinks I just hate on bubble tea places, I happen to like Go For Tea. My friends and I frequented their first location in Richmond Hill, back in the day. I visited the Scarborough location, which is definitely less of a drive from where I live.  This Go For Tea is much smaller than their Richmond Hill location, or it seems smaller. As most tables are sectioned off and it's almost as though you're in your own private area, which is a nice change!   I came here on a Friday night around 10:30pm, we had to wait just over 30 minutes for a table. We weighed out our options, by the time we get into the car and head to somewhere else, it's likely going to be 30 minutes anyway, or our next closest option was Destiny, and I've already shared how I feel about that place.  I find Go For Tea's service pretty consistent. They have buzzers on each table so people are able to contact a staff if none happen to walk by. This is especially useful when you have a big group and are seats are in the back corner, the least traffic area. We were attended to within a couple of minutes after we pressed the buzzer.  I always order the Aloe and apple juice, it's in the health section of the drinks menu, I think it helps clear acne or something, but I get it because it's delicious! I really enjoy Go For Tea's use of fresh ingredients, they use fresh apple juice! Like come on!! Their desserts are on point as well, a variety of cakes and cheesecakes to choose from.  It's worth noting that we ordered a slice of cake for my friend's birthday and the put happy birthday on the plate, as well as adding a candle.  It does get quite dark in here though, most tables don't see a lot of outside, along with their dark decor, your eyes might need a little adjustment period when you get back outside, even at midnight.  I see some of the reviews rag on their expensive drink prices. I agree, their drinks are priced at slightly higher than other bubble tea cafes, but I think proportionally, you get more at Go For Tea, if not for the drinks, their service makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that SOME of the food is decent (i.e. Paper hot pot) but the staff are TERRIBLE. Came for lunch. The restaurant was maybe 15% full. Waited 10 minutes - no one came to seat me. Then I walked up to a waitress and asked if I could sit down at a table she was cleaning. She looked annoyed so I suggested another table which I thought was clean. She responds \"that's dirty too.\" Finally, she wipes the table and says \"ok,\" before walking away. No menu. As she walks by again, I ask her for the menu. She walks a Away and throws one on the table.   No surprise, I waive a different server to take my order. As he walks by, he puts his hand out like this . Excuse me? Rude. I won't be coming back because of the terrible staff who need a lesson on CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"The room beckoned to us from the doorway.  The soft lighting, the dark wood, the floral centrepiece.  Hues of brown and gold on a white background.  We sat on a raised level in the centre of the room.  We ordered vermicelli, chicken, tofu, and tea.  The waiters are dressed in black.  One is from Zhejiang.  He has puffy hair. We look at some hk magazines. The tea arrives. It is hot and sweet and flavourful."}
{"text":"Love their food and drinks. Got their lunch set with Thai chicken and it was very worth it that it came with rice, chicken, salad, soup, and a mini mango pudding. I had left overs too that I brought home, all for 10.99+tax.   The atmosphere is great and the deco is really nice and relaxing so it's a great place to chill and hang out with friends. I've also had their drinks before and their bubble tea is really good, served in a huge glass cup. Although a little pricy at times, but I think is worth it."}
{"text":"Everything was just mediocre; the best thing we had was the popcorn chicken and the mango pudding dessert part of the curry chicken platter. Service was alright, although I did have to get tapioca on the side because they didn't and then couldn't (?) put it in. It made almost no difference in the end because my mango milk green tea was bland and almost room temperature. Also: beware of asking for a large ! They're HUGE ! I left half of it and it felt bad but I was full and it didn't taste like it was worth the chug haha."}
{"text":"The drink was okay, too sweet for my taste, the hot food was terrible. However, the dessert from the cooler was very delicious.  The worse thing about this place was the service, the staff was constant gossiping about their customer! When I walked to the WC, I overheard the conservation of them about other customers, and when I came back, more of them were joining the gossip, how unprofessional!"}
{"text":"This is a decent venue   Got a patio for the summer, which is where I had y first try of frogs legs   It has a dark cool vibe going on the inside with plenty of seating that doesn't feel too exposed   You get a table button for when you want to call for service   Foods decent and the bubble tea comes in 500ml for 5 bucks which is a great deal   Wifi is slow as sin   Recommend going along and enjoying the food"}
{"text":"Charging $10.99 for a dish that contains no meat whatsoever. Had to switch the previous dish, which was a diced chicken and onion with black pepper sauce, and ended up getting 3/4 onions and 1/4 chicken.   Service was mediocre, only due to the fact that they brushed it off with a 'I don't care' attitude when I brought that up to the server. Only reason I give two stars was that the supervisor at least gave me some sort of answer and allowed me to swap it out. Ended up going with chicken fried rice with egg, and same thing with little to no chicken.  I understand meat may cost a lot to purchase, but don't charge $10.99 for rice and egg and traces amount of meat."}
{"text":"Food is OK, service is horrible. The waiter is so rude that almost scared me. I was so afraid of his poker face that I served myself the water without calling him, as the pitcher is nearby. But he gave his coworker a \"what the hell face\" in front of my friend. I don't know, with my personality, maybe too weak to experience their service again. Will never, ever, visit again."}
{"text":"came here on a whim at 11pm because all of the other restaurants around the cineplex was closed I got the mango shaved ice and the chicken fried rice. food was average and I would not come again because it is also expensive  the mango shaved ice was one of the worst I've had but it was still ok  the chicken fried rice was also average  however the service system is good because you can ring a bell and a waiter will come however one time u ringed and a waiter did not come and I was thirsty  another plus is that the decoration inside is beautiful"}
{"text":"Good place for night hangout, the environment is cozy, love the light. I had starry berry smoothie, that was awesome. The toast are really good!!!"}
{"text":"The servers here have terrible attitude. The food is not bad, but not worth having to deal with the poor service."}
{"text":"Went there at Friday night with friends. But really disappointed about everything! The space planning is not good at all. It's like a maze and easier makes you feel you do not where you are. The interior is not bright enough, my boyfriend actually get tripped because they use two different colours of laminate floor. We order the traditional rose tea, I was so surprised they even put sugar inside. Can someone tell me what kind of traditional tea is this? I never drank a traditional tea has sugar inside for my entire life until now.   Overall the space planning is really terrible and the food is really pricey! I would not go there again!"}
{"text":"I went today and shared a chocolate mousse cake with a friend. After about 20 minutes, we both felt sick (I threw up less than an hour after after leaving GoForTea). We didn't want the restaurant to serve rotten/unfresh/whatever cake to other customers. So we called the server over. We told the server we felt sick and expressed our concern that we didn't want other customers to get sick in the future. We were genuinely caring about the restaurant's rep and quality. We asked when it was made or will expire. She came back (after a long wait may I add) and said it was opened yesterday. After talking with my friends, we realized the opening date of the cake box is irreverent to the freshness/state of the dairy and other products in the cake. So we called the server over again and re-asked the original question of \"When was the cake made or what is it's expiry date? & Can I see your manager?\" She returned (without her manager) and said it was made 4 days ago. & asked \"what do u want me to do?\" I said nothing, just concerned if this will happen in the future. She laughed at my comment and walked away We paid the bill for a cake that made us feel like crap and went up to the counter and asked for the manager again. When I talked to the manager, I first stated that I was very displeased with the customer service. I asked for the manager and she never came, I had to go find her. Second, I complained twice & and never got a single apology or sense of sympathy (as my friend & I saw our server smirking to another worker behind the manager as we're talking) . As we re-suggested that the cake may cause other problems in the future, She claimed that if you eat anything rotten, you cannot feel it within 20 minutes. It may not be a full case of food poisoning but it still made us both sick when we came in with no pain. It did not go down right and made our stomachs feel uneasy. Food made me sick/throw-up, over-priced, horrible customer service (doesn't understand or speak English well - said yesterday as \"last day\"), and irresponsible towards customer service, customer health and the Go For Tea's reputation and general service."}

After about 20 minutes, we both felt sick (I threw up less than an hour after after leaving GoForTea). We didn't want the restaurant to serve rotten/unfresh/whatever cake to other customers. So we called the server over. We told the server we felt sick and expressed our concern that we didn't want other customers to get sick in the future. We were genuinely caring about the restaurant's rep and quality. We asked when it was made or will expire. She came back (after a long wait may I add) and said it was opened yesterday. After talking with my friends, we realized the opening date of the cake box is irreverent to the freshness/state of the dairy and other products in the cake. So we called the server over again and re-asked the original question of \"When was the cake made or what is it's expiry date? & Can I see your manager?\" She returned (without her manager) and said it was made 4 days ago. & asked \"what do u want me to do?\" I said nothing, just concerned if this will happen in the future. She laughed at my comment and walked away We paid the bill for a cake that made us feel like crap and went up to the counter and asked for the manager again. When I talked to the manager, I first stated that I was very displeased with the customer service. I asked for the manager and she never came, I had to go find her. Second, I complained twice & and never got a single apology or sense of sympathy (as my friend & I saw our server smirking to another worker behind the manager as we're talking) . As we re-suggested that the cake may cause other problems in the future, She claimed that if you eat anything rotten, you cannot feel it within 20 minutes. It may not be a full case of food poisoning but it still made us both sick when we came in with no pain. It did not go down right and made our stomachs feel uneasy. Food made me sick/throw-up, over-priced, horrible customer service (doesn't understand or speak English well - said yesterday as \"last day\"), and irresponsible towards customer service, customer health and the Go For Tea's reputation and general service."}
{"text":"Yay! Go For Tea at Enterprise is open! I really liked the Richmond Hill location and was disappointed when it closed. This new location features a dark interior with orange accents and lots of dramatic up lighting and interesting light fixtures.  Today is their first day open and they said they were only accepting cash payment.  I can only speak to my takeout experience, which was relatively efficient for their opening day. I ordered the very mango mango slush and asked for it half sweet. The half sweet beverage is still pretty good.  Looking forward to coming back for a dine in experience.  (72/100)"}
{"text":"Go for tea review   I've frequent the Scarborough location, and even though the service was terribly slow, the food was good. I found that there was a Go For Tea in Markham so my family and I stopped by to get something to eat.... Again, the service was incredibly terrible.  The servers do not even look at you or ask what you want to eat... I had to call someone to my table for Menus, food and then cutlery.  I feel like I'm not wanted when I come to any Go For Tea location, but especially this Markham one... When the food came, the only dish that I couldn't eat was the fried tofu... It was over cooked to the point that there wasn't any tofu inside, but just a fried outer later and oil. It was inedible. I got 2 orders, and my family and I couldn't eat it....  The server rarely made an appearance so I couldn't even ask them to change it... I then called someone to ask for the bill and to take off the 2 orders of tofu since we barely ate it... The waiter said he can't take it off.... There's nothing they can do... So I had to pay for the dishes that we barely ate even though it was inedible, over cooked, and disgusting... this will be the last time to this restaurant.  Servers need to treat the customers well and make them feel wanted."}
{"text":"Still love coming here to hang out with friends and grab some small bites. I think part of my liking this place is because I don't live around here, so whenever I do come, it's always a refreshing change from back home. I agree with a lot of other Yelpers in that this place is somewhat overpriced, but if you order the better food and drink options, then it doesn't sting as much. :)  After trying quite a few drinks and small plates, I think I've narrowed down the ones that are worth getting.  1. Popcorn chicken a la carte ($4.99). There is a combo that gives you rice as well. 2. Mango green tea ($5.99 small, $6.99 large) 3. Shrimp and Egg fried rice ($9.99 CAD)  As previously mentioned, their popcorn chicken is fried well, and not greasy. Lean meats underneath a thin bread coating, and for an a la carte dish, portion is not skimped. Served with toothpicks, and plenty to munch on between 3-4 people, provided that you order another carbohydrate.  The mango green tea was well flavored, although sweet. I'd get this again next time, but request less sugar. Husband and I ordered 1 large, and that was plenty for the two of us. I couldn't imagine each ordering 1 large, because we'd probably be bouncing off the walls. Our friend ordered a Very mango slush (large size), and he couldn't finish it. Go with the small if you're looking to finish a drink on your own.  Shrimp and Egg fried rice has a nice and light flavor. I don't like my fried rice to be greasy or mushy, and Go For Tea does a good job in preparation. Flavors were basic in a salt and pepper with a little bit of soy flavor, but the shrimp were small, sweet and fresh. Two eggs were mixed in, and considering the portion of the rice was about 3 cups, this was a great balance in proportion.  The selling point of this place is the fact that it's open late (around 4am), and there is free wi-fi. Depending on the volume of people, the wi-fi speed can vary, but it's still reliable and works. On late weekend evenings, this place is loud, but the tables and booths are spaced pretty well so you're not shouting to your friends in order for them to hear you. :)  All in all, still like this place, and will come back here whenever I'm in the area and want a late night place to hang out and chat."}
{"text":"This go for tea at midland is super beautiful!  The atmosphere is dark and the lighting is awesome if you want to come here for a group outing. Seating is comfortable and even though the seats are close together, you still feel separated from everybody else - it's a very secluded space.  The service is not bad, they serve you quickly and they don't bother you unless you need them. Also, no wifi password for the free wifi = YESSS. Minimal interaction achieved! I'm definitely not joking when I say their drinks are overpriced. The cheapest drink (cold) is like $6 and the slushes are all $7-8.. you can actually buy a meal instead of getting a drink here. However, I LOVE their very mango mango slush- they use real mango and huge chunks of it too. Deliciouso. Drinks like this makes me hate artificial mango.   I wouldn't come here for bubbletea all the time, but once in awhile, I don't mind it. Definitely not my favourite place though, because I'm not about paying two bubble tea prices for one."}
{"text":"It's more of a 3.98123182313 .. LOL  This is right in the heart of downtown markham (hah, I chuckle everytime I say that.. downtown.. markham.. really?) and it's super easy to find, as long as you know where the cineplex is. This GFT is HUUUGE on the inside and definitely a great spot for studying (outlets EVERYWHERE, under all the tables/benches and during the day, it's emptier than my heart so you can definitely find a nice quiet spot to work-at-home or study for your midterms). It's also a cute spot for a date, because of how they spaced out the tables and there are so many booths. The ambiance and aesthetic just make it a good date night - seriously, the couple making out and dry humping in the booth closest to the entrance thought so too.... AND it's an awesome place to hang out with some friends or grabbing a late night bite - it's open till 3am everyday and there are special set meal deals.  I like the golden curry with veggies meal thing- it's only like.. $12? It makes me so full, I feel like I'm pregnant with 40 food babies. I don't know how people finish the meal, but I guess that's good since it comes in a large portion for a fair price. I also love the garlic sauce fried tofu here - that's seriously my asian snack of choice. I can have it all the damn time; they crisp it to perfection too. Om nom nom.   The thing about go for tea is that their drinks are $$$$$ .. the very mango mango slush is hella amazing, with non-dairy cream (perf), real chunks of mango and mango jelly .. but yo, a small size (same size as chatime, relatively) is $7.99 ...lol BYE 4EVER. NOT WORTH. SO NOT WORTH. But kinda worth. Honestly, I don't know.. it's so good.. so if you're feeling bougie as fuck, then go for it.  Service is weird. Some are super quick and friendly, and one asian boy with bleached blonde hair sounds like he's lowkey dying everytime he talks.. he needs some rest. If 'dead fish' could be a word to describe somebody's response.. this would be it. There are bells at every table so you can get a server's attention quickly.  I'd definitely come here to chill, especially when it's late at night."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad, I guess..  Nothing really stood out to me, but it was just a regular bubbletea place. The menu prices are alright, not too high but not great either. The portions for a regular plate of food is more expensive than destiny, but it doesn't taste that much better to be honest. The set meals would be the most worth it, so much food and a half price drink!? Wow. Unfortunately if I ever got that, I would definitely explode.  Seating area is not bad, they closed a curtain thing between us and the table beside us, which was a good idea because I ain't about seeing other randoms while I eat, and this definitely helped. The service is alright, they will definitely come as fast as they see you but if you sit in a further corner.. good luck. I would suggest investing in bells or something so they can get to everyone since this place is huge.  Parking lot could be better, or maybe the people driving could be better.  Overall, nothing special."}
{"text":"The paper beef hot pot was interesting in both concept and taste. Chicken popcorn was good, salmon teriyaki tasty and grilled squid had a different flavor.  The service was really bad - wait staff were cold, unfriendly and they did not even say 'Thank you' after we paid the hefty bill. We will not be going back to this place?."}
{"text":"This place looks amazing! It just opened recently and I've been patiently waiting and waiting since the sign went up about 3 months ago. I finally got to go inside and take a peak.  The inside is super chic. Sort of looks more like a Moxie's than a Go For Tea. There are semi circle booths lined up in the middle and on the sides, basically they utilized all of the space to fit booths, which I commend because who doesn't love to sit in a booth?   When walking in the entrance you are faced with a dilemna, the fork in the road, which way to go, left of right? Left is for take out and right is for dining in. I go for the left. The take out counter is tiny, Very small and narrow, which is fine because I'm only planning to be here for 10 minutes.   Looking into the dining room there are cirque du soleil type curtains from floor to ceiling and it's a high celing at that. It's quite dark inside so taking homework to do there isn't quite a good idea. I'm not sure if there is free wifi here as the other location offers it but I don't see why they would not keep the same perks.  I can't wait to come here and try their food since I feel like they've gotten the ambiance part down. It may be a bit of a drive from my house but trust me, I'm in this part of town too often since my grandmother's apartment is across the street at the Yee Hong Centre and my dad's office is just up the street."}
{"text":"I've tried many bubble tea places all across the city. From the stores in Pacific Mall to the stand alone ones in Commerce Gate. The tea part of it is the simplest, it's a mix or a blend of whatever flavours you desire. That being said, what really makes a good bubble tea? The bubbles of course!  I've had half cooked, chewy, gummy, powdery tapoica, you name it I've probably had that form of tapioca. But nothing compares to GFT's exceptional tapioca. It's the best I've ever had and it has never ever disappointed me with an undercooked ball.   I usually have the jellies anyway, which are star shaped if you were wondering, instead of the usual rectangular shape. The jellies make me happy, they're chewy with a bounce to them and they are in a fun shape. I'm not forgetting the time that one almost killed me when I sucked a little too hard and it ended up in the back of my throat but other than that I have no complaints.   **Just a note about jellies, the ones listed on the menu are NOT the flavours that they have.  The decor inside is...lackluster, I mean the generic dark wood and no butt support on the bench seating. It almost seems like they decorated for the Christmas holiday and then ended up liking it or being too lazy to take them down and there they have remained ever since.   I have yet to try their food, I've had the desserts before and they're good, nothing great but very generic and by the book. I really have no desire to try their food mainly because I'm pretty certain that it's not good and there's no reason to waste my money finding out. The most important thing is the bubble tea and they do it marvelously. Note that if you want to collect stamps to receive a free drink, you can only do so with take out."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited longer for someone to come back to our table to take our order, than waiting to be seated. Literally someone served us water and never came back. It was 20 mins of waiting and saw all the workers by the cash just kicking rocks and staring into the air. I miss the buzzer they used to have to ring a server to the table."}
{"text":"A lot of food choice. Everything works well for me. The server was a little rude when we were trying to order. The location is great, to grab sth before movie."}
{"text":"Nice new location and ambience which is my only positive. Service is done without any appreciation or a smile. No thank you's or have a nice day or enjoy your meal, instead silence and monotonous stares. Food is not great, pre-made and warmed up therefore don't expect a fresh meal. Bubble tea not mixed well, could taste the powder grains throughout."}
{"text":"Until the location in Richmond Hill closed, I went almost every day for my \"fix\". It was by accident that I spotted this location and my car immediately swerved into the parking lot.  Strange. I went in and ordered a Passionfruit Green Tea.  I had forgotten the slightly floral flavour of their tea, and the very distinct but blended flavours.  This is a higher end tea, at a higher end price, and I can only be relieved that I can't come here every day.  Compared to my favourite Chatime, this is better tea, and with Chatimes recent price hike, it is not far off from being a direct comparison. I've locked this location into my navigation system's \"favourites\" list..."}
{"text":"My office used to be a block away so I and my staff enjoyed an addiction to a daily bubble tea.  It was unusual in that they use a very fragrant, perfumed tea, which is superior to almost any other bubble tea place I have visited.  But about the food:  Today I stopped in after a 5 year lunchtime absence.  I ordered the lunch special #2, Chicken and Mushrooms in a Black Pepper sauce.  In regular Chinese food, a translucent sauce usually means very subtle in flavour, or even bland.  This was a perfect pepper sauce--just the right amount of pepper, and a layer of incredible spices that made the sauce alone outstanding!  The large chicken cubes were nicely cooked, along with the mushrooms and onion.  In addition to the main course the tray included a Winter Melon soup, a warm celery salad and a couple of small spring rolls along with a generous bowl of rice.  It was all delicious!  One thing I have noticed over the years:  Go For Tea is more Taiwanese than Chinese.  You don't see their variety of dishes on typical Chinese menus.  The flavours are bolder, and the execution has always been excellent.  Follow up the meal with a Coconut Milk Black Tea..."}
{"text":"This place used to be my to go place for bubble tea in Toronto, but it seems that their quality has suffered in the last year. I appreciate the huge tables, free wifi (although slow), and food options though. A decent place to lounge with friends in a night club atmosphere. Their price is also really high ($6+ for bubble tea)."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite places to go for dinner and bubble tea. They have a wide selection in food and drinks. I love the different varieties they have for food. I always order the popcorn chicken and the spicy intestines!! For drinks i either get hot honey milk tea or fresh strawberry juice. Although this place has a lot of options for food, they lack on deserts. They only offer slices of cakes."}
{"text":"Rating: 2.5   Decided to go here for lunch after a very cruel session of studying for my bio exam and generally this place is okay.   The place was quite large and nicely decorated. It felt like a mix between an actual restaurant and a chill cafe kind of place. You would think for some a large place they would have many staff around. NOPE. I think there was literally only like two around I swear. The time I was there, it was quite busy so trying to get the attention of those two was like HELLA HARD. You will literally break an arm just trying to get their attention. **note: the staff weren't exactly nice either its like wow okay. Do I just attract the nasty staff members in every restaurant like DAMN WHY IS IT SO HARD TO FIND A DAMN PLACE FOR SOME GOOD SERVICE FFS   I ordered one of their hotpot options (beef for around $17) with the kimchi as my soup base. For drinks, I got the lavender slush. The hotpot wasn't too bad. The soup tasted quite nice. It doesn't have that distinctive kimchi taste, but meh it's alright. It was kind of sour and a lil salty at the same time. I think for $17, they could've been more generous with the amount of meat they give you. Although, they weren't generous with the meat, they were very generous with the naba cabbage...I don't think it was necessarily worth it ya feel me guys? Even my bro was like WHY IS THERE SO MUCH CABBAGE AND SO LIL MEAT (he usually doesn't really complain) Like sure, if you're gonna give a small amount of meat and a lot of the cabbage, decrease the price of it right? But nope. As for my drink, terrible. First of all, all their drinks are disgustingly expensive. Most are like from $5-10. Like?!? They don't look that special so why the fuck is it that expensive?! Anyways, I got the lavender slush drink thinking it was so cool. BUT I REGRETSO MUCH. It was tooo sweet and it legit tasted like soap. LOOL Sad thing was I cannot just waste it by throwing it away but I was so close like SO CLOSE. NEVER WILL I BURDEN MYSELF LIKE THT AGAIN NOPE  Although, the hotpot was quite good, I'm not gonna come here again. There's better places for some good ol' hotpot and they are AYCE too (this place wasn't). Also better places for drinks"}
{"text":"We stopped in to grab a drink and a snack. I love the classy/modern feel. I wish we had a place like this in the Bay Area.   As you can see in my pictures. Their reg size is plenty. However, if you are thirsty or looking for a drink to baby over the course of the evening - this is your drink size.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Feel this place has been here since like forever.. though I don't go there all the time, I always like going here because unlike Destiny, their food is adequate and decent enough for dinner and I find their customer service is always so much better than Destiny.    The downfall is their place is so busy, it is very hard to get seats at busy times..    However, you can call and make reservations.   Their drinks have more variety and you actually feel bang for you buck without getting ripped off or overpriced items. I  also loved they have a separate round square tables at the back or small private room for groups...    I will definitely miss this place since it closed down since Feb 22nd... and their new location is due to open in Downtown Markham.. but when? we won't know :("}
{"text":"It's a nice hang out place after the movies but the food is a little over priced and the bubble teas are too sweet. I would opt for other options if it wasn't for the convenience of the location to the movie theater."}
{"text":"Go For Tea at this location is less than impressive. The interior of the venue is quite trendy & has really high ceilings however, general lack of warmth & weak customer attention does not float my boat.  The actual food & drink is decent though, however I should note that if you do order Taro bubble milk tea that is a powdered substitue & does not contain actual Taro.    It's survial sits on the fact that this place is open significantly past midnight & that it is open regardless of holidays. Another noteworthy detail is that Korean BBQ restaurant \"Chako\" is less than 3 minute walk across the plaza parking lot.  I would only go to this Go For Tea out of convenience."}
{"text":"This place literally looks like a fancy club inside! Beautiful, clean and modern. As for the drinks, it's pretty disappointing.I got a large taro slush and it was gross. Very powdery and after the user in the slush melted, the drink was so thick. It was like a creamy airy texture. It costs over a little over $7 and I would rather go to Chatime for better tasting and cheaper bbt. The drink made my stomach hurt after."}
{"text":"Been passing by this place since this plaza opened and its always looked pretty contemporary from the outside.   Surprise! with its dark, intimate, contemporary zen like decor, GO for Tea is a nice place to check out.  Tall ceilings, with an extensive menu of various food options, bubble teas, and desserts....pretty much my new chill out spot! HELL they even have a button to press to get your waiter's attention..(like they have on airplanes) Anyhow we were here for dessert and bubble tea. Cakes: we ordered their Tiramisu a 4/5 which was very light, and not overpowering with sweetness, but rather perfect balance of coffee.  Their Chocolate cheesecake yum!! perfect 5! just wish it was bigger lol... silky, smooth, and sweet, a big change from the Tiramisu. Their bubble tea, I ended up having their Almond milk bubble tea with tapioca...again another hit!! 4.5 out of 5. Overall the place is very clean, chic, and busy....great for groups, and they have a range of foods to dish out!"}
{"text":"Close to Hwy 7 and 404 this location is convenient as its right off the highway and accessible! I have been to GO FOR TEA before, but figured it was time to finally write a review about this place lol!  The place is very modern, with asian inspired contemporary decor.  Its dim lights with variation of lighting all around the vicinity creates a chilled out environment, and most of all this place was clean!  Our server was able to accomodate our request once we realized our table for 2 kept on tilting back and forth.  In no time we were placed in a larger booth.    For drinks 'the miss' had a small banana smoothie (which was more than enough) and I decided to GO BIG or go HOME with a large banana mango smoothie.  Let's just say holy s#@$ it was a huge glass mug.  It took me some time to finish it, but nonetheless you could taste nothing but pure fruit, which was delish! I'm just glad that I didn't take my blood sugar after lol!  Overall the drinks were a 4.5/5   *****...side note the miss advised HER banana smoothie was too sweet.. :/  (sounds like a potential Yelper in the making ;) )   Our service was nothing to rave about, they were pleasant, and efficient. :) at times, but barely came by to check on us.  Next time I will have to stop by and try out their versatile menu...overall 3/5"}
{"text":"Overall, 2/5. I would only recommend it if you're in the area and craving for some bubble tea AND food because you are starving and will eat anything (if just bubble tea, there are many other better places in the area that serve just that).  Ambiance: Very big, have never had to wait for a table. They even have free wifi so sometimes you will see study groups in the booths. Cleanliness is questionable.  Service: Fast! So fast that it makes me question whether the food is fresh... I'm assuming it's all pre-made and they just heat it up. Once, I got an entire entree of chicken fried rice about 3 minutes after ordering - no exaggeration.  Food/Drinks: Drinks are good- some are a little too sweet for my liking. I usually order the hot milk black tea with tapioca, and they provide the liquid sugar on the side, which I appreciate. Food is not great in my opinion - very greasy and unhealthy. Again, cleanliness is questionable- not sure I would like to see their kitchen... eek.  Price: Reasonable"}
{"text":"Kind of expensive. Their bubble tea is heavenly. I had the coconut milk tea and the honeydew milk tea. Delicious."}
{"text":"I came here last around 3 pm to grab some tea and internet before heading to a meeting.  I was looking for just a coffee/tea spot in the area, and although the decor and staff don't really make this spot feel like a hang out joint (rather a destination), it suffice for the purpose.   I'd say in between lunch and dinner the place is a ghosttown.  Even the staff were no were in site. When asked to get my hot tea to go, I was told they weren't sure it could be done, then another server asked me for my order and produced a hot green tea in branded togo cup (15 minutes later).   For a $7 cup of tea to go and indifferent service I'd probably rate them a 2 star, but I'd give them a benifit of coming at an off time and appreciating the food, tea selection and decor to bump another star."}
{"text":"Someone else said \"go for tea... elsewhere\" and I have to agree with him. My friends and I were looking for a place to relax after stuffing ourselves at a nearby korean bbq place for lunch. After being seated and checking out the menu, we immediately noticed that all the drinks were really expensive (even a regular tapioca milk tea was nearly $5). Reluctantly myself and one of my other friends were about to place our orders when the waitress told us that we would have to give back our table if not all of us were going to order something. Keep in mind that we were all full from our lunch.  I personally still wanted bubble tea regardless of whether or not we got a table so I placed my order (small taro bubble tea). 20 minutes later, I was still waiting. Ultimately we ended up walking out because the service was just awful and they were just asking for way too much. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert after a nice ramen dinner. We were seated quickly on a Saturday night even though the place was pretty busy. I was surprised by how many people ate dinner here as I thought it was better known for being a dessert place!  The vibe and atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice. Dimly lit, nice decor, and comfortable couches for seating - although, it can get quite loud with the abundance of families and children eating.  I ordered the Matcha & Red Bean Milk Shaved Ice. The portion was a lot bigger than I expected and I struggled to finish it. However, the taste was average. It started out pretty good, but by the end, the shaved ice was melting into clumps and the taste got worse. Overall, the average food and somewhat-slow service led to a mediocre first experience here."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before, but I don't head north of Steeles often anymore, so it's been a while since I've been here.  First thing to note is that Bubble tea has gotten pretty expensive over the years (it can be $10 including tax and tip etc, for a drink with no alcohol?!? - I'll take that with a shot of vodka, please...)  Nevertheless, we had a good time.    I ordered a large almond green milk tea with tapioca, and the drink that came out was monsterous (it was the size of my head), the girls ordered some brick toast with condensed milk (for old times sake - but it's $4.99, and pretty big as far as brick toast goes).  Not to be cheap but it's pretty much a thick slice of bread with some condensed milk poured on top and toasted...the mark up on this is crazy (I need to buy me a bubble tea place, and retire, just kidding :))  So other than the prices getting a bit out of hand over the years, I'd say this was pretty good value, the portion sizes are massive, so I'd go with the regular size next time..."}
{"text":"We've been here a number of times.  Love the atmosphere, the tea and especially the snacks.  It gets busy during the weekends.  There is a large variety of things to eat.  Read the menu over carefully so that you get what you want.  There is a potato lace dish that is quite tasty.  The Taro on Ice is very refreshing.  We like this place and enjoy hanging out with friends there."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go back to this Tea Shop as my past experiences have been sub-par. However, I decided to get together with my friends here since it was opened until 3am, later than all the other teashops in the area.  The ambience is beautiful - decorated with glowing lights. My friends and I were seated in a booth in the back, separated by fabric to the other booths.   The following drinks and desserts were ordered throughout the night: DRINKS: 1. Hot Almond Milk Tea with Tapioca 2. Lychee Green Tea with Passionfruit Jelly 3. Mango Green Team 4. Mango Slush 5. Orange Juice 6. Coffee  DESSERTS: 1. Custard Filled Toast 2. Tiramisu 3. Mango Mouse Cake 4. Chocolate Mousse Cake 5. Chocolate Cheesecake  For the most part, I was very happy with the dishes (yes, I tried a little bit of everything!). Their cake assortment was extensive, in addition to their overall menu, but we didn't get anything cooked since they stop serving after 10pm. My friend was upset that his mango slush was watered down and when the orange juice was ordered, what we received seemed like orange powder mixed with milk. All the hot drinks were accompanied by sugar syrup in little shot glasses.   Thank goodness for good company :)  A new invention that Go For Tea has implemented is a buzzer system. Instead of checking on you consistently if you are ready to order, you can buzz them to your table. Pretty effective!  We stayed until 2:30am and I was not impressed that they were using heavy cleaners to mop the floors while we were still there. It was very nauseating and made me want to leave."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, MUST TRY THE LAVENDER SLUSH. I get cravings in the middle of the night for it 10/10. Other good drinks to try are watermelon juice with milk and curry pineapple soda."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to hang out uptown. They always have a dim and relaxing atmosphere. Perfect for catching up with your buddies or loved ones.   Go For Tea has a great variety of food and drinks. Their main dishes, like noodles or rice items are quite generous in terms of portion. Snack dishes are a little smaller but good for sharing. Their drinks are quite filling as well and the size is completely up to you.   One of my personal favourite is the sausage fried rice if you're into simple main dishes. It tastes great and will definitely fill you up! I also went with my mom on another occasion and we got a fried chicken/katsu with rice noodle. It. Was. HUGE! The soup looked really plain and made me not want to eat it but it was actually quite flavourful! Don't be fooled by its appearance! The chicken was also pretty good!   Though if you are looking for quick service, this wouldn't be the greatest choice for you. The pace of the service is rather on the slow side. When I went with a group of friends, we asked the waiter for extra spoon, and even seeing a group of people there, they only gave us ONE extra spoon. It took multiple trips for him to understand what we actually needed. But if you aren't in a hurry, it shouldn't cause too big of a problem. Due to the environment being a little more on the dark side, it may also take a little while for get noticed by the staff members there.  Overall, Go For Tea has nice quality and variety of food and drinks items. Along with the relaxing environment, this should definitely be a place to revisit! =)"}
{"text":"Their dishes are hit or miss, and the bubble tea isn't very good for my tastes. However, I love coming here as they have a couple dishes I absolutely love, and the decor is beautiful. The service kind of sucks however, they give you tiny water cups and are forgetful or nowhere to be found when you want more. They're nice enough at first, though.  I recommend: Octopus balls (takoyaki), fried tofu with garlic sauce, stewed pork in Taiwanese style, and the three kinds of soyed dishes (the intestine and pigs ear is really good).  3 stars because a few good dishes and the pretty room cannot hide the lacking service and multitude of bad dishes. I do recommend this place, however."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening with a bunch of girlfriends. We had a vegan friend among us so we ordered mostly veggie stuff.   Stinky Tofu ~ They were in very small cubes with a drizzle of sauce on top and a side dish of pickled cabbage and hot sauce. Cubes were a bit dry and not that tasty.   Veggie Fried Rice ~ without the Eggs. Pretty good, lots of flavour and had a good \"wok\" flavour to it.  Veggie Stir Fried Noodles ~ Most of my friends didn't like it much. Said it lack flavour and didn't like the texture of the noodles. I was ok with it. The noodles were the thick flat clear vermicelli noodles.   Black Fungus Salad ~ This was quite good, very simple dish, but really refreshing and nice flavour to it. Had a slight vinegary sweet sauce to it.  Liked the very spacious atmosphere and the dim ambience. It was a nice place to relax and chitchat. Would come here again for girl talk night ;)"}
{"text":"Service : 3 / 5  Environment : 3.5 / 5 Food & Drinks : 4 / 5 Price : 3 / 5  Overall : 13.5 / 20   Comments :  - there internet is extremely unstable, always disconnects and loses connection.  - music being played in the background is to loud during evenings, but okay during the day. - the waitress should learn to speak and understand english - drinks are better then Destiny but not as good as TenRen's"}
{"text":"Very bad experience! When I called over a waitress named Mao Mao to order meals, I was kinda struggle a little between two choices, and then she was like: \"we are quite busy right now, please call me after you are ready..\" I was like....WTF??? I looked around and It wasn't busy at all!!!!! And then I asked her if they have certain meal available, she was like \"anything not on the menu, we don't serve it\". Come on! That was a simple Yes/No question!!! After serving us, she was just standing there by doing nothing! I've ordered teppan squid, and the chef was putting the peppers all over the squid, nothing tasted like teppan, it was totally a pepper squid!!! The picture attached is another meal I ordered... seriously speeking, I felt sick when I saw all those hairs."}
{"text":"I love the interior design here! They have a lot of booths & it's nice to sit by the window on a sunny day. This place is huge and pretty empty on a weekend afternoon, but definitely convenient for a quick bite before/after movie. Service is mediocre but not complaining, although one of my pet peeves is when you ask for water and they only give you one glass and not for the other person/table.   I had the Red Curry w Seafood from the All Day menu ($12.99 on weekends) - comes with rice, soup, cooked napa, salad and dessert (milk yogurt pudding). Pretty good.  $7.99 for the afternoon tea/late night special - choice of fried meat/fish + a side + 50% off drink. Got the popcorn chicken & sweet potato fries - fries were good but super small portion, like maybe 6 fries? Ripoff.   Overall nice ambiance, ok food but expensive."}
{"text":"Go for Tea used to be my go-to place when I wanted to eat Taiwanese cuisine food. I used to always have to line up for to get in, because it's usually so busy fulled with young people. But as I visited last night, Monday night at 10:30 pm. I walked into the door and the diner was only half full, yet nobody came to greet me. I had to wait till someone notice me to get a seat.  Once I was offered a table, can't help but find out that all the server and waitresses  were all in the kitchen area, chatting amongst themselves. It took forever for someone to come up and take our order, even though we sat next to the counter and the kitchen.   The service here is literally none-existing and sloppy. They don't smile at you or offer any hospitality. So many times I had to stare at the waitress so she can talk more quietly to their colleague. The most crappy part about they were talking amongst themselves, is the fact that THEY WERE MAKING FUN OF THE CUSTOMERS IN MANDARIN. Since I understand the language, I find it so unprofessional and unacceptable.  Other than rude service, the food and drinks are very much mediocre. There's picture to the food we get, as people can tell, there's no such thing as 'presentation'. FYI the free soup that comes with the meal, was cold by the time we received it."}
{"text":"Bad service. When the food get to my table, I got no chopsticks or spoon. I need to ask the waiter to get me one. The attitude was not pleasant at all. I feel like that I am begging them for service. Short ribs are very chewy and noodle soups left me feeling thirty (too much MSG)! You can see why there are only 1/4 of the restaurant was filled during lunch hour. By the way, you must ask for water because they won't being them to you unless you ask. When you order food, make sure you order quickly and know what you want, otherwise the waiter will be very impatient with your indecisiveness.  Never will go again!"}
{"text":"April 25, 2018 - I ordered \"Braised lamb w/ satay sauce & onions\", it was very filling and tasty (I have leftovers). Normally I get the lamb w/ cumin. But  today I wanted to get something different. My meal was very good 5/5!   My cousin ordered \"Thai Chicken special set meal\". She gave it a 4.5 out of 5 (only because the side dishes changes everyday depending on what they have). One of he side dishes she loves is \"an egg and tomato dish\". But she really liked her meal overall. She also ordered a \"Strawberry black milk tea\", which she likes. But I tasted and I didn't like it  that much."}
{"text":"Pretty dark place when comes to lighting but that could be improved. On weekdays, it is pretty empty minus a few groups of business associates gathering for meetings and what not. Me and my co-workers had stopped by since we were in the area. I'm not really impress with their service. It's really slow. Trying to flag down a waiter even when the place is practically empty is almost impossible unless you're yelling waiter! waiter! LOL even after taking our orders, it takes almost forever for them to bring out the food or drinks.  I just ordered the popcorn chicken and lychee green tea that day. I'm surprised at the price for drinks. It's a bit expensive compared to Destiny's. After this first and final time, my co-workers decided next time we go out to eat, we're going to Destiny's instead."}
{"text":"Went here for a late night tea/dinner with a friend. I have to say that the table we sat at was a little awkward...lengthwise. I felt that we were too far apart and had to raise my voice a bit. It didn't help that there was a couple on either side who were also seated very close. We could easily hear each other's conversations leaving me a little uncomfortable. The service was also not too great with the server taking their own sweet time to find us. Eventually had to track someone down to order. Food was quite acceptable. We ordered a beef ribs dish and fried rice. As for tea, I had a large honeydew milk green tea which I advise against simply because of the size. A regular would have been just fine. For the food, I'd say it was a good place for late night eats, or to grab a tea at the end of a fun night. Don't plan on making this a highlight of your evening."}
{"text":"I've been to Go For Tea's Scarborough location, but mostly for late night snacks and desserts, never for dinner. This new Downtown Markham location looks really nice. The ceiling is really high and the lighting is intimate. They have several large communal tables and also some smaller, more cozy booths in a well divided space. Nice.  Our orders included the Thai Chicken set meal with rice, soup, spring rolls, salad, and ice cream. Not bad for 12.99. We also had Popcorn Chicken, a salmon dish, Deep Fried Squid, and Deep Fried Tofu. I had the Sizzling Lamb Satay.  The lamb, although not bad, wasn't exactly what I was expecting. Yes, it was served on a hot plate, but it was in a foil \"boat\", bubbling but not sizzling. It would have been better in a clay pot.  I got to try most of the other dishes that I mentioned. They were good but nothing stood out as \"must order\" next time. Overall, it's a nice atmosphere with good food at decent prices but the service could have been friendlier."}
{"text":"I've been to Go For Tea may times, almost always for late night desserts and snacks. The space is divided into smaller areas, including private rooms for small groups. That, along with the high ceilings and intimate lighting make it feel classy and cozy.  For this outing, we had a group of eleven and we had just finished having dinner at a nearby restaurant so we were here for dessert. We ordered a variety of hot and cold beverages, icy slushes, cake, shaved ice, and fried rice. Fried rice? Did I mention that we just had dinner?  Everything that we ordered was good and the portions were generous. The service was fast and efficient but not necessarily friendly and engaging. The rating would have been higher if the service was better but I'll continue to come here for the desserts."}
{"text":"Ordered their special combo to go, they didn't Include rice soup or dessert!! Just the chicken, a spring roll and a salad. Very disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I had the popcorn chicken with a side of rice and meat sauce. It came with three halves of spring rolls (which is kind of weird when I stop to think about it.... why three halves??) and some fried basil on top. A sizeable meal for only 10.99. The service was quick and efficient. The staff tend to leave you alone after you've gotten your order, so you can take your time and just flag them down when you need anything.  This place has been around for a while and the quality has always been steady even as the prices have slowly crept up over the years. I would not suggest coming here to work or read since the place is not well lite but it's perfect for chatting and catching up. A good place to catch up with a friend over a drink or to congregate in a larger group for a meal since they have some large tables tucked into the sides of the venue. This place gets busy during the evenings, especially on the weekends but I find it pretty quiet during the daytime hours."}
{"text":"Service still isn't the best, however, I have to admit - the braised beef noodle soup isn't bad here."}
{"text":"I tried the a Fried Tofu with Garlic Sauce. It was identified as one of their popular dishes on the menu. It was $7.99, but not worth it. Just plain ol' fried tofu with a (not that generous) serving of sauce on it. The sauce is not even that good. I don't know what I was expecting, but it was not this."}
{"text":"The location is really good - right in downtown markham. It's a nice place to go after you watch a movie. There's always spots - so you never have to wait. However, food is a bit over priced. A typical meal + drink can go up to $~25-30 dollar for dinner"}
{"text":"This place seems to be a good spot for hang out while waiting for movie to start since is next to a cinema. Additionally, it's a good spot for homework or gathering for a chit chat... The place itself is quite big and tables aren't too close to each other so there's enough privacy. Overall my experience was quite pleasant, I ordered myself beef udon n coconut milk tea while my friends order something else that comes as a set(forgot names of their dishes). We were all satisfied. Their pudding taste like those from AYCE pudding/yogurt. Price is a lil high but it's alright."}
{"text":"A unique place to grab a meal. Kind of crowded later in the evening. Seems to be a very popular place to come and hang out. Good food and a huge menu. Some very authentic Chinese cuisine. Tea was excellent."}
{"text":"My friends took me here for the first time.  I usually go to Starbucks for tea so I thought a change in environment would be nice.   The employees were relatively friendly and knew the menu well. (I'm not a bubble tea drinker so I don't know what to order.) There was too much to choose from so I just went with the Fresh Aloe and Apple Drink, 1 matcha pudding and 1 mango pudding ( I just realized that I didn't order the mango pudding, I ordered the original milk pudding..) Not a big deal...everything I ordered was yummy anyway.   When we went around 21:00 on a Friday night, we got a seat right away but when we left an hour later, there was a lineup of young teens and students sitting, standing, chatting, texting, blocking the doorway, and such..   2nd time going there was a much better experience, and it was to go. It was a Tuesday night around 21:00. There were a few empty tables so service was faster. Got our drink in 2 minutes."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and have had bad experiences every time. First off, the food and drinks are not very good along with being overpriced. The place is also very poorly lit making it difficult to read anything including the menus. The last time my friends and I went, the employees gave us attitude as we were a big group. As I looked around most of the seats were empty anyways and they had tables available for us. As my friend pulled out a board game, they mentioned that we could not play once it was 9pm. If there were other customers looking for seats I would understand but the employees just gave us more attitude. I convinced my friends to walk out and just go to the Chatime next door where we could play our board game without disturbance. And it's also such a rare occurrence in which I would walk out of a food place. I will never go to Go For Tea again as it always ends up in disappointment."}
{"text":"Waitress are terribly rude. They just threw the menus on the table and left before we even sat down. Not kids friendly. We even have to move the highchair ourselves. There are plenty of empty seats, but they forces us to sit next to the door. Food is just so so."}
{"text":"There's a lot of choices available, but the so call \"call/buzz for service\" button doesn't work, even when the server tells you to use that when you need assistance... I've probably pressed the button 4 times without anybody responding, and finally had to wave at them to get attention. And this didn't happen once, I've been there a few times, and it's happened at least 3 times, until the end I just wave no matter what and have given up on pressing the button. If they can improve on their level of service, I think I would give them another star."}
{"text":"The first time I went to this location was a few years ago & at night time so it was a really long wait & super busy (which obviously is great for them but sucked for us since we waited about 30 minutes to get seated).   I decided to visit here again last week during the lunch hour instead. We just wanted the bubble tea to go & it was great, the server took us immediately to the side & we were able to order right away. He even mentioned the points card (signed me up- why not?) & pointed us towards a empty booth we could wait at.   I got the basic taro with tapioca, but my friends got more adventurous with their choices & all were fabulous. I've been here twice since -- & its probably one of the best places for bb tea. Glad I came back! Definitely better coming at non peak hours if you just want 'to-go'."}
{"text":"Totally forgot about this place until I found out that it had moved to downtown Markham from Hwy .. Geez i'm so slow in realizing this....  Located right next to the cineplex and very conveniently connected to alot of other stores nearby.   I hadn't gone to this place in many years since probably my second year of university. So it's been awhile. The new location is really nice imo. Large interior space with modern interior design. It was a bit too dark at the time I went but i guess it's suppose to set the mood?   Everything about Go For Tea still remains the same as I knew it back in the day, all the food and drinks are all relatively unchanged. Even their menu looks exactly the same as well. Drinks are all same and same portions. And that's one thing I missed about Go For Tea is their huge bubble tea glasses. You can literally just be full off drinking bbt and no food here.   Great place to go studying or just to chill, plenty of space to relax and chat and kill time. Brings back good memories =)"}
{"text":"Out of the 3 large capacity bubble tea cafe in the York region, this one is the one that the others do try to compete with the most. The service is ranges from ok to highly inattentive; which is perfect if you are looking to catch up or doing a large group meeting. They are able to accommodate large groups of people and offer more options for food than their competitors. Should mention they do offer your choice of 2-7 dish combinations with rice and soup, which is moderately pricy in the York region area, especially when you count your drink order. There is a minimum charge of 3.99 per person. Also free, but slow Wi-fi is offered."}
{"text":"Place is dark inside and somewhat hard to see things, ie the menu which doesn't help.  The interior looks more like a lounge then a bubble tea shop. I much prefer their Thornhill location's decor with nice lighting and ambiance. The bubble tea here is decent. Price is typical begins at $3.99 for regular sized, green tea. Additional $0.50 for tapioca / jellies and additional $1.00 for large. I really like their very mango mango slush. It's mango slush with pureed and chunks of mango inside, and it comes with star shaped lychee jelly. I ordered one in large and added tapioca pearls and it was so good. But it costs over $9 after tax. A steep price for bubble tea."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere to go with friends to catch up. The menu selection is large and extensive. They have a variety of cold and hot teas, milky drinks, slushies, smoothies, traditional style teas. The food here is pretty good too. I like their king pao chicken with rice. I personally really like their original milk black tea. It's the closest resemblance to the ones I have all the time in Taiwan. Their tapioca has a nice texture, not too mushy, not too hard, perfectly chewy and sweetened :) And if want some cake, they have half off cake specials between 3-5pm."}
{"text":"I didn't realize there was a Go For Tea in this area and upon realizing that, I decided to give it a try.  I went here on the same Friday night I experienced that nightmare at RONA (see my other review).    Service was not that great.  The place was half full and we asked for a booth, which they said they couldn't give us because we were only 2 people.  Meanwhile, there were 2 people sitting at a booth.  Double standards much?  Halfway through eating our meals, there was another party of 2 who got seated in a booth.   The food was mediocre.  Food lacked flavour and most of all, some stuff lacked freshness - some meat appeared to be overcooked too.  The bubble tea was nothing that popped out.    The ambiance is dark...very dark.  It's like they're trying to make it like a dine in the experience or something mystique?  I don't know what they're trying to do actually.    Nothing really worth going to as there is lots of really good Taiwanese places elsewhere in the city!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and this place was LIT. Half of Markham was up in this joint.  The menu was overwhelming with a ton of options for tea and food. I ended up going with a safe pick... the Thai Chicken set menu (which came as a tray with salad, soup, spring rolls, rice, chicken, and some sort of pudding). My friend and I shared the mandarin orange hot tea. Everything was delicious and reasonably priced.  Service was nothing special... no one really checked in with us, but servers were usually close by if we needed anything. Overall, I had a good experience and would come back again."}
{"text":"Very slow and inattentive service! Environment is clean and decorative, drinks are average."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say it's the worst bubble tea place or I wouldn't say it's the best bubble place. The service was awful. The waitress looked like they were so unhappy. Although they have those buttons on the table. Where you tap a button to notify them that you want to take an order or pay your bill or something etc... Sometimes they don't even show up even you press the button. I haven't tried their food so i am not gonna talk about the food. For the drink, they are not bad but it's not best i tried. So i say it's pretty good. What i like about the place is that how dark the place is. And also free wifi. Overall i think it's pretty good but i wish they can improve their service."}
{"text":"Poor service, poor food choices, if you planned on having anything other than a snack and to spend time with friends don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"One of the places my girlfriends and I usually go to just catch up after a long week, the inside is always pretty dim with nice lighting, and you can charge your phones with outlets underneath the tables, which is super convenient.  The food here is the typical Asian dishes priced just like any other bbt/cafe places.  The specialty set comes with salad/soup/spring rolls/dessert alongside the mains, so it makes a pretty good deal if you're just looking for a regular meal     The drinks here are okay, I think Destiny's has more variety but the interior at Go for Tea is definitely a lot nicer if you just want to hang out :)"}
{"text":"Go For Tea is overpriced for tiny portions of mediocre food. I'm usually not a picky and overly critical eater. But when the quality does not match up to the price tag... then there's a problem. We ordered the popcorn chicken, takoyaki and deep fried tofu. Other than the below average food, it is definitely a great hang out spot with friends or if you're trying to kill time before a movie!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night and it was jumpin'. Who knew that all the cool kids in the 'burbs dress up and stand in line to drink bubble tea? I was a bit put off by the line, but we only had to wait 5 mins. for a booth in the centre of the room. The space is large and lounge-like, with high ceilings, mood lighting, and cozy round booths (plus, a really nice party room is available). There are lots of Asian fashion magazines too -- and not just women's ones.   The menu is a big book. Some of the fancier slushes are pricey, but my regular strawberry green tea was $3.99 + $0.50 for tapioca. Pretty standard pricing and the tea had the usual sugar-y, artificial fruit-y bubble tea flavour that I kinda love. They have your typical fried finger foods and snacks as well.   We found service to be prompt, thanks to a little button you press when you are ready to order and ready for the bill. We did not experience any attitude from them.   There's not a lot of places to go out at night in the 'burbs, so if you want a relaxed place to chill over non-alcoholic drinks (since you are probably driving) and chat, then Go For Tea fits the bill nicely."}
{"text":"Most people come here for the bubble tea, so did I, until I tried out their dinner menus, and I am not referring to the single serves, I am referring to the dinner for two and up.  They actually have a good variety of Taiwanese dishes, my favorite is the stewed pork, 3 cup chicken is a bit on the spicy side, portions are smaller than I would have liked, but price is definitely reasonable.  I give it a 7 out of 10."}
{"text":"Spectacular looking food, above-averge taste. I also love the fact that I was not bothered when my friend arrived 45 minutes late.  My friend ordered the squid sukiyaki and I ordered chicken sukiyaki. She gave the thumbs up for her squid dish and cleared the plate, I thought the chicken was tasty but not very exciting.   Almond milk tea was excellent without the sugar since I find the milk already brought a hint of sweetness."}
{"text":"It gets busy, although we only had to wait 5min to be seated (group of 3) for dinner on Xmas Eve.  Very relaxing atmosphere, comfy seating, well spaced out tables, and beautiful decor. It's a bit lounge-y for my taste though.  Surprised by all the negative reviews. We had a pretty good experience here. The servers came to us pretty quickly (we never had to use the service button).   The menu is huge and lengthy. The waiter actually came by 2-3 times to take our order but we weren't ready as there were so many options to choose from! The food options are a very typical set found at tea/dessert places - a mix of Taiwanese, Japanese, and some Thai options. Pricing is alright, but the food quality wasn't particularly great, but I'm pretty sure people come here for the bbt/drinks rather than the food. Our order was served pretty quickly.  We got the ??? was extremely salty, and the Stewed Salmon was just okay. One of us also got Satay Squid Broth w/ Vermicelli in Thick Soup which was pretty good, but they messed up and gave us noodles instead of vermicelli.   As for drinks - the Hot Mandarin Orange fruit tea was pretty good. Same with the Sesame Milk Tea (also hot).   The free wifi was a bit unstable when I tried it on my phone, ended up just using my data plan instead.  And there is some rumour that this place is owned by gangsters? Lol"}
{"text":"The decor in this tea shop is fantastic.  They really make an effort to decorate for some special occasions too, like Christmas - and it's not the cheesy green tinsel that you get that the dollar store.  It's really nice, with lights and ornaments. My friends and I go here a lot just to talk over bubble tea and we're willing to wait the 15-20 minute wait sometimes for a table during busy hours (weekends at night).  The bubble tea is good, I like their \"very very mango mango\" (I think it's called... I just know it has multiples of the words \"very\" and \"mango\" in it).   The food is usually good too (but over-priced).  The food serving portions used to be really large and so, that justified the high price but I noticed that they recently changed the portion sizes to about 1/2 to 3/4 of what they used to give!  That disappoints me greatly, or else I would have given 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is another bubble tea hang out place that I like to go to with my friends. Personally, I like this place over Destiny but there's really no big differences (prices, quality of food) except perhaps the service is slightly better here.  I've ordered fried rice, cakes and drinks before and they're all pretty decent. They're not exceptionally delicious but it's a great snack when you're just chilling with your friends.  They also have very interesting bubble tea choices here such as peanut butter, rose and lavender which all taste pretty good!  My only complaint is that this place can be better lit (which isn't a real complaint!)"}
{"text":"The food here is definitely authentically Chinese and my family are a bit fan. The lunch specials at $10.50 are also fairly generous.   It's just that if you're a vegetarian, it gets tiring to eat accidental pork in stirfry tofu."}
{"text":"The service was a very slow, got some of our orders wrong, but the selection of drinks were good; lights are dim, good atmosphere to catch up with friends with."}
{"text":"So I've been coming to this spot for a while now and all the times I've been here the service has been the same. They don't welcome you when you walk in, they don't really show you anything special on their menu and they don't check up on your table. Their drink prices are also pretty steep as well as their snacks/food. I've tried their special mango drink and that was probably my favourite drink of theirs. I also had their lychee slush and it was good but it tasted like straight up syrup. The cup they gave it to me in was also so sticky. My friends got the lava cake and it literally just look like an upside down dried up muffin, we opened it up and the chocolate that was supposed to pour out dried up. I'd say the only good things I've experienced here is the availability of late night bubble tea (open until 3 am) and their individual washrooms."}
{"text":"As a patron of decent bubbletea and having explored bubbletea from all four corners of the world including Taiwan where bubbletea was founded, I must admit that Go For Tea isn't too shabby of place.  Try out their 'very mango mango slush' - this drink is divine especially if you are a mango lover like myself. Mango slush with mango jellies topped out with nice whole chunks of mango.    Delicious."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place got some 1 and 2 stars.  The service can be hit or miss, depending on how busy it is.  When worse comes to worse, just stand up and flag someone down as they walk by.  We usually get take out and order ahead of time and have yet to be disappointed.  The stamp cards are a plus!  I haven't had any adverse experiences with the quality of food - so far so good!  Items that are ordered frequently:  fried tofu with garlic sauce, popcorn chicken, chicken fillet with rice, sweet and sour fish fillet with rice, black milk tea (cold, no tapioca).  The place could use better lighting; sometimes I feel like my eyes are being strained just trying to see in there."}
{"text":"I go to this place often because my mom and I love to share the pork bone soup hot pot. The beef and veggies are fresh and the broth is delicious. It's not too salty. I also like the Taiwanese fried rice and bubble tea. However the service is always bad when I go to this place so it turns me off from going more often. The waiters are very very slow. Also the prices are inflated for food that costs very little to make."}
{"text":"We decided late one night to go for tea... no, actually we had our eyes on the Very Mango Mango Slush, which one of my friends had tried before, and which came with these cute edible stars.  And very tasty too!  It came in a choice of two sizes ($6.99/$7.99) in these heavy glass mugs.  The place wasn't quite hopping, since we had no trouble getting seated immediately, but it wasn't empty either.  They had some tame Christmasy decorations up... in July...  Service was a bit slow, but I'd come again.  While I'm a fan of the VMMS, for now I'll rate the restaurant itself A-Okay."}
{"text":"Terrible service - the waitresses were either unavailable, irritated, clueless, or plain rude. Such a shame as the place has such a nice ambience to it... will not return."}
{"text":"My favorite bubble tea restaurant. Great atmosphere, their food is excellent, and their mixed fruit tea is to die for. VERY under-rated. I drive all the way from Mississauga to go here."}
{"text":"Went to Go For Tea tonight for supper. When we came in there was no staff to greet us. It took almost two minutes before someone came to us. The restaurant is huge but very dark. Our table had a small spotlight shining on it but it was not very bright. The menu had a good selection. I took the fried rice with taiwanese sausage and my wife took the pork lunch set. I ordered a black tea to drink and the waiter asked me what size. I was confused because in the menu only one size was mentioned. The food was quite good. My wife had spring rolls with her lunch set, and when she asked if there was sauce with them, he did not understand the question. Overall, the food was fine but the atmosphere and service could be better."}
{"text":"Fiance really wanted to take me to a Taiwanese small eat place back at home. Being the biggest sweet tooth and a huge fan of brick toast, I happily agreed! I was really excited when I saw the menu for brick toast. I chose Taro, Condensed Milk, and Egg Custard. Taro - was not sweet at all.. tasted like they just mashed up the taro and smeared it all over the toast.  Egg Custard was oily, salty, and tasted like they dusted it with a heavy layer of milk powder! YUCK.. i took 1 bite and i was done. My fav ended up being the condensed milk but it was just standard toast. Soooo disappointed. I also ordered the lavendar slush. It was ok. Wished I got the milk tea instead.. but me always wanting to try things I've haven't seen in other places... BLAH. Fiance ordered their minced pork noodle? He said it was good but nothing amazing. The service was terrible by the way. The waitress was obviously hung over from the night before. She slouched over one of the booster seats for most of the time we were there. We couldn't flag her down since she's not even looking up! Probably won't ever return.. makes me appreciate St. Alp's tea house so much more here in NYC!"}
{"text":"We ordered the dinner for 2; spicy chicken with spicy sesame sauce & lamb with onions and peppers. The chicken dish came out within 5 minutes, but lamb took a lot longer. Overall food was okay, service was terrible, atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Terrible set up for this place. Took me forever to find the washroom - it's like a maze in there!   Service was not good. staff was rude and seemed judgmental.  Also, there is a minimum charge if you don't buy."}
{"text":"Go For Tea is a pretty large restaurant that has an incredible atmosphere to it.  There's a ton of space and the fact that tables are far apart from each keeps things a lot quieter than you may expect for a large place like this.  There's actually a lot of walls too so the sound doesn't echo around too much so it's perfect.  Parking's reasonable and they're open very late so that even those night owls can go out and have a place to hangout.  I haven't ordered a whole lot there but based on what I did have, I was impressed.  My favourite is the lamb udon.  While it has egg and mushrooms in it - which I don't eat - the lamb, noodles and soup base themselves are all way above average.  It also comes in a semi-fancy bowl with a wooden holder.  I also got the popcorn chicken and wings, which weren't as great, but worth trying at least once.  I got strawberry milk green tea and wasn't too fussy about it... got black tea instead and it was a lot nicer.  Prices are pretty reasonable, but it varies from item to item.  Just be warned that they tack on an extra 10% service charge for groups of six or more.  Edit: So, it should be noted that they don't allow board games here on Fridays-Sundays.  Huge shame because there 'was' a nice place to bring friends to play.  It's a nice place out, separated from other tables with a large enough space for most games.  We brought games once and they didn't bother telling us this until well into our time there.  They really should have told us right away.  Docking a star for all that.  Service could use a little bit of work.  They seat you right away, assuming there's room.  I think it was getting full around midnight on a Sunday so just be wary that you might need to wait.  There have a button each table that appears to let the waiters / waitresses know that you need them but it can take two or three tries because they actually follow up with you.  While the system itself isn't terrible, it clearly needs to be polished a tocuh.  I'd be happier if they just assigned each server to an area and had them check up on you every so often if they can't follow their current system.  However, after you order, the food / drinks are actually really quick to arrive at your table.  Since I use this place as a lounge-type area, I don't honestly mind waiting all 'that' much.  Go For Tea is a good place to go if you want to hang out with friends and you need a place that's open late.  The atmosphere's amazing and it's a real shame they don't allow games here.  Since implementing this (it was semi-recent too), I'm docking them to 3 stars instead of my previous 4."}
{"text":"Drink and food are both overpriced but they are not too bad compared to other bbt places. Been here at least 20+ times and recognize most waitresses and waiters. Most of the time they just hang around and chat, but if you get their attention they will help you with your order or whatever you need. Evironment is dim and could potentially be romantic...but it gets pretty loud at night when the place is packed."}
{"text":"C'mon, go for tea. I used to love it so much until it started serving Lipton tea bags in their premium tea. It's disappointing to see your $7.99 lily tea comes with 2 lipton tea bags and tastes exactly like Lipton tea and nothing else. All their other drinks are on the sweet side as well. I definitely do not recommend anything in their tea section (ironic with the restaurant name...). However, food there is above average. The combo is a good deal."}
{"text":"Service wasn't that good from my experience, they didn't speak English very well and when I hit the call button they never came. I had to keep waving down my waiter.   Atmosphere was super duper nice, I was surprised how nice the place was.  I tea drink I got was pretty good and looked great. My only complaint about it was that the drink could have been colder. I got the Apple and Starwberry tea.   In terms of food, I got Grilled Salmon with rice. It wasn't anything special.. Plain white rice and two tiny pieces of salmon. It was dry and really wasn't worth ~$12."}
{"text":"First time coming here. I came here with friends on a weekday afternoon. Interior looks nice... lots of wood. It was pretty empty... only about 4-5 tables occupied. We received service through a push button mechanism. Staff expect customers to order individually, rather than ordering to share. We had to actually ask for extra cutlery and plates... Service is only there when you ask for it.  On to the food!  We ordered the: Fried rice Lunch set - $8.99 - comes with 1 soup, 2 spring rolls, and kernels Thoughts: really oily fried rice.  It looked like clumpy sticky rice. Tastes okay. It was the last dish to come. Soup was good, it was a pork rib based soup with radish...also some ribs in there. Spring rolls meh. Kernels.... no one touched that.  Beef green pepper and onion + Lamb and Cumin - $18.99   - comes with 2 rice and 1 soup Thoughts: Both are very oily. But lamb and cumin was swimming in oil. Ugh... The lamb and cumin dish was over-spiced with cumin to the point that i had a mouthful of cumin seeds each time I took a bite. It was too pungent; it totally overpowered the lamb. Also, there was more onion than lamb in that dish. The beef and green pepper and onion was okay. The beef was soft.   Taro spread on 1 thick toast of bread $5.99  -  alternatively condensed milk version for $4.99 Thoughts: Good, tasty. But kinda too simple for $5.99. They burnt it the first time and it took forever to get to our table...  Overall, the food is overpriced and really oily. I feel that these dishes are not worthy of eating. I could make this at home and it would taste a lot better. And that says a lot.  Lowest price of drink is $3.99 (small). Water is free, in a very small cup, and you must ask them to refill it.... practically no one around with a water jug (must buzz them in). As well, all customers are expected to order individual drinks. There was no option for hot tea in a teapot."}
{"text":"Overall: 3/5 SUMMARY: Definitely a place I'd come to again for the drinks/food and the atmosphere. However, the waitering/waitressing needs improvement.  Food: 4/5 The drinks were surprisingly good! I went there with 3 friends and tried each of their drinks, in addition to ordering my own. All of them were on point. One of my friends got a mini-hotpot, which was good quality and tasty. The octopus balls/takoyaki were a little underwhelming in terms of visuals, but they tasted good as well. Not the best food ever, but it was solid.  Interior: 5/5 Went there second week of opening, so everything is still clean and new. The location is great, since Cineplex is right beside it, and you can watch a movie before or after. My first impression of this new location is definitely the interior designing. The decor looks absolutely great - modern and original. I really like how the lighting is dim, creating a really classy ambience. And the tables are arranged in really dynamic ways.   Service: 1/5 The waiters and waitresses looked very confused. They aren't assigned a certain area of the restaurant like most other places, so everyone just runs around throughout the floor, without any responsibility over any specific tables. Strike 1: Nobody checked on us throughout our entire meal. Strike 2: Our octopus balls took more than 45 minutes to come. Strike 3: I've never waited longer for a waitress to return my change in MY LIFE. Seriously. The service needs work, and really brings down the quality of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is huge. Coming from NY, we don't have many restaurants that take up this much space, let alone a teahouse. Goodness - impressive. Bf brought me here; it's his favorite place for the ice mango bubble tea. I ordered my standard hot sesame bubble tea and it was a great combo with the sesame and condensed milk toast - yum! The nifty bell you can ring at our booth was a great way to get the waitress' attention (as I can totally see how it'll be difficult the flag someone down in this large dinning space). Service was initially slow even though there were only a handful of costumers (weekday around 4pm)."}
{"text":"They made it more upscale so they can charge more. Place is definitely nice for photos but don't expect quality food.   I ordered the chocolate bbt with grass jelly and it was too powdery. The price was so high for a damn drink. I should have just gone a few steps for Chatime instead. The salmon fried rice was good though but portion was a bit small.   The only problem I had was the staff. While they were quite polite, the waiter who took our order seemed clueless and I must've repeated my order a few times! I could have gone to the kitchen myself to make that powdery chocolate bbt. Sigh"}
{"text":"This place is just okay, the kiwi slush here is awful ( made of sugar syrup) The food here is oily and not that tasty But it's a good place for friends to hangout and chatting, the decorations r nice with comfortable chairs and tables"}
{"text":"I ordered a custard toast and barley milk black tea while my gf ordered a business dinner combo. My toast is alright and there was a lot of barley in my drink (I have been to bubble tea places where their barley milk tea doesn't have any barley taste or texture). But in my gf's dessert, she found plastic wrap inside her pudding and she did not touch the dessert afterwards. I wouldn't recommend unless they treat food safety more seriously"}
{"text":"I honestly like the location at midland more. I ordered a tiramisu, blueberry cheese cake, popcorn chicken, Hong Kong style shrimp and passion fruit green tea. The food is part decent but when it's late at night there's very little options to choose from so I decided to finally give the go for tea a try at enterprise. The interior design of this go for tea is a lot nicer but when it came down to food and the service the one at midland is better. I would rate the food below average because the dishes I ordered are the ones I regularly order at the other location. Cakes are of course always the same so they were decent.  When it came down to the service though I was super unimpressed... I honestly usually let things go since I understand maybe this person had a long day or maybe even something's happening with their lives but this wasn't an excuse on how poorly one of the staffs treated me. First off, once we sat down my boyfriend wanted a drink even though we were waiting for friends so he ordered one and she tried taking the menus. I nicely explained we were waiting for people and she gave me a cut eye. The last straw was honestly when I asked for the bill to be split and she got the bills wrong. Instead of apologizing which I wasn't even expecting she literally rolled her eyes and stormed off. I found that super unacceptable. It's okay to walk away and not say anything but it's definitely not okay to roll your eyes and storm off the way she did. This is the first time I've ever filed a complaint on someone... that's how bad it was. I'm never ever coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Although I normally enjoy the food and drink here, I have to express my disappointment in their poor customer service based on today's incident.  I made a reservation for a birthday dinner for 13 people for this evening.  When we arrived, there was a sign on the door saying that due to water damage, they were closed.  I did not receive any call to notify me of this, so my party of 13 people were left scrambling to find another restaurant nearby to eat.  I understand in emergency situations such as experiencing water damage, the right thing to do is to fix the problem before allowing customers back into your establishment, but it would have been nice to have been notified at some point during the day, given that I made a reservation and provided the establishment with my phone number.  I expected that they would have the courtesy to let me know so that I would have had time to find an alternative.  Especially since this area is normally quite busy to begin with, it was not the most convenient to have to find another place to accommodate that many ppl on such short notice.  I hope that in the future, they will treat their loyal customers with a little bit more consideration."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is a little mediocre, except the tapioca in their bubble teas! They're super sweet and yummy~ I find myself always coming back to order a  slush with tapioca because they make that veryyyyy well. And although they jacked up their prices so that its ~$8-9 for a large slush with tapioca, I find myself still thinking it's worth it because it tastes really good. I've tried the popcorn chicken and the toasts and stuff a few times, and they're just meh.  Atmosphere is ok it's just a somewhat dark lit area for you to eat and sit."}
{"text":"This is your standard taiwanese bubble tea hang out. It is open late (until 3am) and has all the variety of desserts that will fulfill your sweet tooth cravings. I have ordered a number of desserts and food items from here and would highly recommend the sizzling plate of beef and green onions and a good pot of tea. You do get unlimited refills of hot water for your tea if you order a pot. This is perfect if you are planning to spend some time at a hangout to chat with friends, especially late at night. Service is also extremely quick and could be accessed through buzzing the button that is situated at most tables. I would also recommend their cakes on their menu and their shaved ice items."}
{"text":"has to be my FAVOURITE place for bubble tea in TO!! everytime i come back to TO, i visit this place.   it's always packed but the place is huge, and it's worth the wait. cuz they're open LATE!!   AMAZING ATMOSPHERE, for a tea house you can sit in for hours, it's huuuuuge. and it's one of those places that look like it could turn into a club after hours cuz it's that trendy and poppin. (may as well since it closes at like 2am - all they're missing is a live dj)  HUGE MENU for both food and drink - everything i've had on this menu is good, and they now serve western style plated desserts, there's a whole new cake section.  *a must try for late night: taiwanese sausage fried rice.  omg, so simple, and so good.  it's missing a star b/c of service, it's hit or miss and it really depends on your server, but it's team service so you pretty much receive what you ordered, and have to flag someone down anytime you want anything else. but it's definitely a place to check out in Toronto if you have a car - i have yet to see any other city do bubble tea like this. yay!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favourite bubble tea places! Not to mention the drinks are great but the food is also very delicious. The atmosphere here was relaxing and comfortable; very spacious. The interior is very nice as it is definitely a cute place to go on a date ~ The service was also very good and fast.   I would recommend to a friend for sure!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere in the new downtown Markham location.   I've always been a fan of their food menu. It's tasty and has many choices.  On weekdays,  their lunch combo special is only $10.99 and comes with soup, salad, main and dessert. Drinks are extra cost. I ordered the frog legs and lotus root which was pretty good but a bit too oily.  With a order of hot green tea the whole bill came up to $20 with taxes and gratuity. Not the cheapest lunch meals but great space to hang out and socialize with friends."}
{"text":"New location in downtown Markham and things are looking better already.  Service and food seems to have picked up and the decor is very nice.   Their traditional set meals are still there and I like the curry dishes that come with those sets.   The menu looks very much the same and the drinks are still their specialty and are still $$.  They open till 3am everyday!"}
{"text":"We ate like way to much Korean BBQ and decided to go get some Bubble tea to digest.  It was quite busy and even though it's quite huge it had a feeling of classy trendy place where Kids and young people goes instead of a Starbuck.  It's a restaurant with a huge menu and a bubble tea/drink menu as big.  I had a Peppermint with tapiocca which was a powder bubble tea. It was tasty but they have some more natural with better tea option.   In my opinion, they wanna please way too many people by having everything they may be losing on the quality.  I can't say for food as I didn't eat but I was told it use to be better by my 2 locals friends who goes there often."}
{"text":"Upon entering, I was astonished with the interior and the decor. By far one of the most stunning restaurant interiors I have seen. It was also darker than I anticipated but was still okay for me. My friends and I were escorted to our seats without waiting too long and we basically had our own room to ourselves which was sweet. There was a beeper to call a server on our table which was convenient.   My friends ordered the Brownie Cheesecake ($5.99) and it was surprisingly not as big as we thought. I ordered the Very Mango Mango Slush with Grass Jelly in a large (dollar extra from small). Once I got my drink, I noticed they mistakenly added Coconut Jelly not Grass Jelly in my drink so I beeped a server to have them redo. The server came and asked if they could just add the Grass Jelly and I allowed it.   My slush didn't taste amazing compared to other Mango Slush I have tried, it just tasted okay."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea restaurant (yes, restaurant) ever. I always get the mango slush with lychee jelly and it's huge. Whatever you do, don't eat the food. Stick to the bubble tea! Super cozy and it's just unbelievable that a bubble tea place could be this nice."}
{"text":"I've tried bubble tea places all over this fine city and throughout the US and this is by far my favorite place to have a deliciously bubbly treat; I'm not even a huge fan of bubble tea! They are open really late, until 3am if I recall correctly and also have free Wi-Fi.  Walking in you are welcomed in the huge space with high vaulted ceilings, large windows all around, dark wood and glass dividers, dark hardwood floors, an elevated middle section, seasonal planters, Japanese style private booths, banquettes, perfectly dim lighting, magazine and game racks, floating shelves, and even a heated patio area. This space's decor was expertly chosen as it has been open since 2004 and still looks great and modern.   The star of the show is the bubble tea. They do have a huge Taiwanese menu and all the food I have had was very good as well as a very extensive tea offering but when push comes to shove, you gotta get the bubble tea and it better have tapioca bubbles, not that mango jelly stuff people love. The tapioca is the star of the show as I have never had it better anywhere else. They cook them perfectly, There isn't a hard chew in the middle from under cooking or crumbly bit from overcooking. They taste as if they have been cooked in honey because they are the perfect amount of sweet. You will not find tapioca bubbles cooked better anywhere.  Service is hit and miss but once your order is in you get things very fast. If you come after 8pm you may have to wait a while as this place gets really busy.  Overall, the best place for bubble tea anywhere. The price is average for bubble tea and definitely worth it. Bring your laptop and you can Yelp your review from there!"}
{"text":"Might actually be my next go-to for yummy food!  Yes, with other Yelpers, I agree that their bubble tea is overpriced for nothing really special, especially since Chatime is next door. BUT, they make up for it for value in their food. Their menu is huge... from taiwanese snacks to Chinese food to even hotpot.. they got it! Lunch and dinner sets are $13, which comes with your choice of meat, white rice, spring rolls, salad, soup AND dessert!! Say whaat! This literally screams value to me. I had the diced chicken and mushroom set and my mother had the golden thai curry set. The chicken and mushroom is not bad but I would prefer if all of their meat were boneless. The golden thai curry had the option of you choosing your type of meat at no additional cost; the seafood came with a variety of shrimp, imitation crab, mussels, as well as some veggies. The curry sauce itself was not spicy at all. Both sets were very filling! Their afternoon and midnight specials - which is basically a fried chicken + potato/fries combo plus 50% off drinks for $8 sounds pretty good to me too. Everything came quickly and the quality of food did not disappoint! I hope they can keep this up.  Upon arrival, we were immediately seated during a Saturday evening. Business was not overly busy and servers were kind and attentive, often checking up on customers to clear tables or refill water. The only thing that bothered me was that their card machine was broken but they have an ATM by the front entrance, but I am willing to let that slide since this location is still fairly new.  Ambiance here is perfect. Not overly loud and you can still hear your elbow partner and their radio playing. Lighting is dimmed during the evening and some larger tables even have candle lighting. Wood and glass interior gives a classy, warm, and nature sort of vibe. A great place to grab drinks and snacks with a group of friends. In the afternoon, I assume it would be a great place to study or get some work done. Definetely one of the nicer Go For Tea's I have been too.  Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Beware of credit card theft!! My husband has left his credit card in this restaurant at 3pm yesterday, then he realized that his card was missing and called the restaurant to confirm at 10pm. They confirmed that they had the credit card so he went to retrieve the card immediately after.  The next morning, the bank called to confirm some payments.  At about 4pm yesterday, only an hour after my husband left his card at go for tea, three attempts were made in the U.S.  The first was to pay for a used car in Georgia for $6000, another was $2000 for a treadmill in some other state. The third one was for an iMac for $3000. This is way out of the line.  Apparently, someone (may or may not be connected to the restaurant) has sold my husband's card to a third party in as little as an hour. If he or she hasn't done it before, there's no way this could happen so quickly. The bank said that they will conduct a series of investigation on this matter. Please consider seriously before you use credit cards at this location."}
{"text":"One of the only reasons that I actually come here is really just because it's a convenient place to grab dinner before a movie.  I honestly do not have much to say about this place because it really hasn't changed much from their old location.   Service is quite terrible, as usual. Waitresses generally have on a rbf and do not pay attention to customers. I'll give it to them that the restaurant is quite large and it is a lot of space to cover, but that's what the service button is for, right? I literally tried, and failed, to get the attention of any one of the 6 waitresses tonight. Even clicking the button a good 5 times, it's safe to say that it's useless. After finally waving down a waitress, we placed our orders and she walked away with the menus without a single nod or acknowledgement, forget about smile!  Food here is actually quite good in contrast to the lack of service. I have tried many of their dishes as well as sets and I am surprised every time with the good quality of food! I love their Thai chicken set, which is also a good deal during lunch hours. Their fried rice and traditional Chinese dishes are quite flavorful and tastes very authentic for a Taiwanese restaurant. I would recommend trying their traditional dishes rather than their snacks, which are not as impressive.   Prices here are higher than many other Taiwanese restaurants, but the food is definitely up to par.   The restaurant's décor and ambience is very nice, making it a good place to chill or study. Most sofa seatings have outlets as well, making it laptop friendly!  If it wasn't for the convenient location and alright food, I don't think that I would frequent this restaurant at all. Some may not care for service but to me, service is part of the experience in restaurant dining. Trying to comfortably eat while facing unwanted attitude really puts me off. Go For Tea has been around for a while, but their lack of service really needs improvement."}
{"text":"Wide variety of drinks and great selection of food !   I tried the paper hot pot ginseng chicken. The pot is made with paper !!!! I don't know why it can hold up to the broth but it is amazing !!!! The soup base is a bit salty after it's been boil for 30 minus but the favor is great."}
{"text":"go for tea... elsewhere.   Over the years, I've grown to dislike go for tea more and more. The menu doesn't seem to have changed all that much, but the quality seems to have gotten worse.   The bubble tea is above average at best and the desserts are frankly a little boring with options like Sugar Marmalade springing up. The food is interesting, but I could get better (price and quality) elsewhere. Also, I don't know if it is just me, but I hate the crushed ice desserts. For $8.99, you get mango/red bean/ taro/chocolate with condensed milk over crushed ice. That's it. I was a little upset.   The saving grace of this place is that it is very accommodating for groups of all sizes and has great service. The servers are petty quick and attentive. The decor of the restaurant"}
{"text":"the service = 2/5 food = 3.5/5  bubble tea = 3/5   it's pretty pricey here at go for tea, but a decent place to go i guess most places offer the same prices anyway. if you come at night there's usually a wait time to be seated. (weekends)  they need to hire better servers.. just saying."}
{"text":"This was our second time here. We visited at diffetent times during the day with the same results.  There's a lot said about service. You can have the best decor, delicious dishes but if you're always waiting to be served( they have buttons against the wall says something about their lack of attention to customers..they don't answer.) and your waiters don't smile or are not helpful then you're in the wrong business.   Despite the bad service, we gave a generous tip cuz we know how hard waiters work.   Located in the \"downtown\" area of Markham next door to the VIP Cineplex, this place is a popular alternative. If you like Taiwanese cuisine then usually, this is not a bad place.  We went all out got a combo chicken with egg rolls as appetizers with main meals of padtay and curry flavored beef..got specialty wines with watermelon refreshments...  But boy that service :(.   $$-$$$"}
{"text":"Was looking for a late night snack and Go For Tea was one of the options available. I like how this place opens till really late (2am) and kitchen doesn't close till 1:30am.   We got the popcorn chicken, Thai chicken dinner set, tapioca milk tea and lemon green tea. The popcorn chicken was alright, nothing special. I've had a lot better. The set dinner was pretty good! Fair priced for the different dishes you get as it comes with an appetizer, main, sides and desserts (it comes with soup, salad, Thai chicken, egg cooked with tomatoes, rice and mango pudding). All that for only $13! The milk tea was standard like everywhere else, but the tapioca is made really good here. The lemon green tea is not good, do not get it! It tasted like super bitter lemon peels. We got larges and its HUGE. There's not many selections for dessert though, they only had cakes/bubble tea.   Service was good, food came out quick and servers were attentive. The washrooms need more attention however. The washrooms have private stalls and each one was stinky, messy or dirty.   This place has a nice ambiance: dim lights and music played softly. Good place to hang out and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"I love the dim lighting and the vibe here. I love how you can play cards while sipping bubble tea with friends. But I don't like the drinks. I used to come here all the time before Chatime, Coco Tea, or ZenQ existed and the drinks were always decent to me. Now that I've had better, I can honestly say damnnn they suck. It's been probably a little over a year since I last came here to chill. They've changed the menu a bit - added more food options but the drinks are still the same. I can't stand the powdery and sugary taste. They need to catch up to Chatime and those other popular bubble tea shops. You know.. those special flavours.. options for ice and sugar levels. I really don't mind the fact that the servers don't understand or speak English too well, but they're very slow and not very attentive. At least I know they won't interrupt you randomly when all you really want to do here is hangout with friends, play some cards, or just talk."}
{"text":"i haven't been here in a really long time. but it was out of convenience that i did today. my opinion of this place still hasn't changed. it's a pretty standard sit down bubble tea shop but nothing here jumps out at me and tells me i have to keep coming back like a few other competitors. If you want a place to sit down and chat and have some decent bubble tea then it'll do just the job but there's nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"had their iced mixed fruit tea (with no ice), and stewed beef ramen noodle soup.  the iced mixed fruit tea (with no ice) was a bit lack luster. maybe it was the fruit choice. the apple and orange pieces were ok, but the rest of it could have been better.  the stewed been ramen noodle soup was pretty good. it could have had a bit more of a kick to in in regards to spice, but otherwise it wasn't bad. i would order it again."}
{"text":"Before even talking about the drinks and food here I have to commend this place as having a super clean men's washroom. Either Asians have no aim or no desire to keep their washrooms clean as typically I fear entering washrooms at places like this. Whatever the reason, I appreciate it and can only imagine their kitchen as being super clean if they can manage what many establishments fail to do.   There is a huge selection of teas and drinks here. My favorite is the papaya milk. It is sweet, cold and refreshing.   Their food items are of great value and everything is rather tasty.  Squid tentacles are a must have snack.  One of my favourites on the menu for a nice cold dessert during our hot summers is the shaved ice dessert.  They don't say it on the menu, but you can mix the toppings so for example instead of just taro or just red bean, you can have taro and red bean shaved ice.  A slight increase to the price, but worth it in terms of tastiness."}
{"text":"1) The wrong drink came. 2) Drink tasted like detergent. 3) Bill took 45 minutes to arrive despite reminding them on three separate occasions.  There are vastly superior alternatives less than a stone throw away. To give this place one star is too generous."}
{"text":"Our family hit this place a few months ago around May and the one thing that hit me like a load of bricks was the fine print at the bottom of the menu ...  STORY TIME!!!!!  The first time I was hit with a 2 drink minimum was at Cleopatra's Barge located in the Caesar's Palace in LV circa 1990.  A Bar Rescue tip is that you do better with a \"2 item\" minimum opposed to a \"2 drink minimum\".  The last time I was slapped with this was at a crappy low-end topless strip joint I was dragged into by my brother in the same city a few years later.  I never drank $9 (x2) bottles of beer so fast.  FF to the future where there are replicants roaming the galaxy.  I am sure in that futuristic time the \"$3.99 minimum per person\" would be flashing and probably coming at you in 3D (3D as in part of that ritual \"this time around we WILL actually make 3D a reality ... people's homes will have all their walls ensconced in 3D!!!!\"  Sadly, they didn't know their history.).  Which brings us full circle back to our visit and the main problem I had.  Perhaps this place is hopping on a Saturday night at 12AM like say Ten Ren around the corner, but I haven't seen any similar restrictions there.  Being a capitalist society I, therefore, will never go back to Go For Tea for this reason alone.  No idea if it is really enforced with all patrons - but our table was blessed with a brand new trainee employee who I am sure met a very fluent Canadian born individual in his life but never met someone like myself - so he was rather intimidated and was ultra shy.  That is why I kept calling him over to help us so that if there was a \"$3.99/patron limit\" we would escape that this time.  My kids had the $3.99 fruit drinks - no ice (per request - though that took some work to explain it) - drinks were cold enough.  The wife and I (ahem) shared a hot black tea with honey drink.  Value wise it was, all the drinks appeared to be worth the $3.99, but the tea was sickly sweet.  In a perfect world you would be able to say \"half sweet\" or at least be asked \"how sweet\" before you order.  We were not told and the world is not perfect since everyone's version of \"half sweet\" is different.  At Starbucks at least you can say \"2 pumps\" v. \"less\" etc.    Having gone to Ten Ren many times for their black honey tea - this is no Ten Ren.  And we paid and ran out of there before the $3.99 per drink minimum police came rolling by our table ... never to come back ever again.  Washroom was clean enough; where they were making drinks - a bit of chaos and didn't appear to be all that clean IMO.  We had just eaten and we didn't want any food so no comments there.  The End.  PS If you want to enforce such silliness and it is not 24/7 and not all patrons then you need to upgrade your menu to put in limits -- like \"a $3.99 minimum from 11PM for groups of 6 or more\".  If this minimum is not enforced 24/7 - then you will lose business for sure if you do not upgrade the menu.  I am sure there is a world of options including \"less\" or \"half sweet\" - but I don't frequent places with my family and adhere to minimums (save for credit card usage)."}
{"text":"Having been here multiple times, I'm sure there are better options out there.  The decor is nice, with high ceilings and draperies, and very dark and intimate. But that being said, there's been several times when I get in there, and there's no one greeting at the front, and I'm kind of just wandering around these \"dark, intimate\" halls trying to figure out who works here and who doesn't! Dark clothing on servers means they blend in!  The tea itself is meh! No real tea taste, lots of powder. I usually order the hot honey milk green tea, no tapioca, and the last time it was majorly sweet. Food is also just MEH. I tried the soy sauce platter before, with the pigs ear and egg and such, and it was, as expected, drenched in soy sauce. So not much can be commented on that. Fried chicken was similar...tasted fine, but it's fried to death so of course it does!  So I'll be here if friends want to me, but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone else."}
{"text":"Ordered the special set menu.  Picture shows a main dish, bowl of rice, soup and two side dishes.  Side dishes in the picture was two egg rolls and a salad.  I ordered this on the premise I would be getting what was in the picture.  When I received it the two side dishes consisted of some radish shavings and tomato with scrambled egg.  I asked them repeatedly for the egg rolls and they told me \"EVERY DAY IS DIFFERENT\".  The advert says absolutely nothing about the side dishes being different every day.  Complete scam."}
{"text":"Went here because it was near the place my friend and I ate kbbq. I got the large mango slush with tapioca for around $9. I found that pretty expensive but it was an interesting experience. The dark lighting made it a calming environment, I also saw a lot of people there studying."}
{"text":"I would've rated this place higher if it wasn't for its price setting. Overpriced for sure!   They serve food that can be made out of materials that probably costs under 3 / 4 dollars; for 16 / 17 dollars! This sucks because I love the aesthetics of this place but cannot make it a \"go to\" place...  The dessert menu is any slice of cake for 5.99   I like the get the following:"}
{"text":"You'll either find me here with a laptop and a pile of papers or with a poker face and a deck of cards. This is one of my all time favourite spot to study or hang out!  I LOVE the intimate vibe it gives off due to its dim lighting accompanied by its homey decor. This is the only location that I'm aware of that offers the \"intimate\" vibe. Other Go For Teas I've been to are very bright that it's almost appropriate for shades. But hey, if you like the brightness then go ahead by all means.   It is very spacious and they have booths that can accommodate up to 5-6 people. Service is not the best as some of the yelpers have mentioned; they won't bother you unless you need something. On the brighter side, they do have a service button! If it's not on your table then just simply look behind your booth and you'll find that gem.   Some items on the menu are a bit over priced however, they do come in a good portion and tastes expectional. I usually catch their lunch special (11am-3pm) since it's a fair deal for a price of $10.99 that comes with rice, soup AND dessert. Feeling for something more than soup? No problem. Order ANY drink from the menu and just pay half its price! I told you it was a fair deal, didn't I?   Recently, I came here for the Golden Thai Style Curry while my friend ordered the Red Thai Style Curry. The Golden Thai Style Curry hit the spot however, the Red Thai Style Curry was a tad too sweet. I thought it would leave my mouth on fiya because it had 3 peppers beside its name on the menu but, that wasn't the case... So, for all of you who love the heat in curry, I'm sorry to say that these thai style curry dishes will not do justice for you. If you're not a fan of curry go for the Lamb with Cumin or Chicken and Mushroom dish. If nothing appeals to you on their Lunch Special menu, go for the taiwanese style sausage fried rice or vermecilli. You won't be disappointed! Oh, one more thing... I just have to mention that this place make the BEST strawberry milk green tea!   Overall, good spot, good food, good drinks and that's what puts a smile on my face. (:"}
{"text":"The menu is ridiculously large. After 20 minutes of looking at all the drink options, I had to ask the waiter what he recommended.   The place is quite large with tables and booth seating options. It's a good place to go with a group of friends and chit chat over fruity drinks or sit in a booth on your own and use up the free WiFi."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with my colleagues.I ordered a beef paper pot (the taste was okay) and one of my colleague ordered a main dish combo $10.99 but it didn't come with a rice. Drinks is obviously not included. It's abit pricey for a lunch but I will come back for dessert next time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The bubble tea is great & the place is so pretty, especially their bathrooms. Every time I go to toronto, it is a must that I have to stop here for a drink. I actually came here for dinner and I was so surprised that the food wasn't bad! Everything was cook perfectly and very tasty. I ordered a taro bubble tea and their tapioca is very chewy and sweet! I can't wait till I go back here again!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite date areas to go to. They have a variety of good Chinese/Taiwanese food. The only downside to this place is that the servers are sometimes a bit rude, and the food here are very overpriced. It's in a great location, there are movie theatres nearby, a fitness center, and many more great stuff."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great presentation! Atmosphere is really inviting, really comforting.Definitely a place I would go with friends!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place.  The atmosphere was really chill - the room was dimly lit, and it was kind of like a maze.   I had the popcorn chicken and thought it was really good, but you can't really go wrong with that. The portion for my meal was big, but some of my friends were complaining about how small their servings were.  Would come back!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place.  The waitresses are extremely rude and seem to ignore beeps from customers to place their order.  They mess up our orders quite frequently as well."}
{"text":"Dear Go For Tea Markham location. I absolutely love your bubble tea and food selection. I come here all the time. But can you please please, I beg you, please use a proper wash cloth and solution to clean your tables. This is the 2nd time I've sat down and been welcomed by an awful stench. Please solve this problem as cleaning your tables hygienically is a part of customer service and health standards."}
{"text":"Dropped by Go For Tea on a rainny Saturday.   I found the inside dark and depressing. The chairs no comfortable if you not lucky to get to sit on the cushioned sofa seats.  Services was not too friendly or attentive. We have to wave the wait staffs down a few time before they will take our orders.  The bubble tea is ok. I have better. My friend mistakenly order the extra large with tapicoa. ($5.49) Yes it is huge with a lot of tapicoa. But not something I really enjoy.  The Mango cake is delicious though! Not to sweet and really light. More like a mousse cake.  I may not be back again unless my friends want to meet up here for a drink.  They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"Pepermint milk tea was yummy but hot barley milktea was too sweet. Cozy environment and Good for killing time"}
{"text":"Although this Go For Tea is super nice and classy with FREE WIFI, their drinks are seriously overpriced. I mean, it's a good place to head down to with friends or a significant other for a relaxing dessert outing, but that is only the case if you are willing to pay $8/$9 on drinks.   The service is super fast and to be honest, just get a meal instead of a drink since it's basically the same price. That being said, their drinks are still pretty decent so you aren't paying for some bad tasting draaannnkkkkkkk ;)  I wouldn't come here for just bubble tea, but once in awhile it's not big deal because they are open late for those late night cravings."}
{"text":"Go 4 Tea used to be the WOW place to go for bubble tea. But as the whole WOW effect died down... whats so good about this place?   Well, their tea and food is great.. and the environment is very comfortable. Also offers free interenet as well.   The only bad thing is the price is on the higher side which u would expect to spent $10 to $20 for a drink with food. A drink itself would probably cost you around $5 to $8 bucks."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.  Saw lots of bad comments regarding their service so already expected slow to no service.  But maybe they have improved?  Surprisingly, got all my ordered quite fast and smooth.  It was about 80% full on a Sunday lunch.  Good food and vibe.   Good place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I really like the environment of this place, it's really dark with lights only shining on tables. It's another of those good places to chill with friends and drink bobba tea late at night cause nothing is open. They have very comfortable U-couch seatings which can get really nice a cozy! There's magazines at the front for people to read, but I don't think anyone reads it lol. They have free wifi and it's pretty fast connection.  The only food I've tried from them is those mini hot pot dishes, which I think is sufficient for one person. The bubble teas are a little expensive.. I got the milk tea and that was already $5. We also ordered the kiwi yogurt and it was waaaay too sweet. They put it under \"healthy\" section too."}
{"text":"Our party of seven visited for lunch.  We ended up ordering only three different items: Thai Chicken set and Stewed Streaky Pork set from the Special Set Menu, and Popcorn Chicken with Rice from the Fried Entrée menu.  All items costed $10.99.  Below is the individual rating of each diner:  - Popcorn Chicken - one diner ordered it - 4 stars.  Reason: I like Go For Tea  - Thai Chicken set - four diners ordered it     - diner 1 - 3.5 stars.  Reason - I liked it   - diner 2 - 4 stars.  Reason - big portion, tasted good, nice decor and ambiance   - diner 3 - 4 stars.  Reason - tasted pretty good, good portion.   - diner 4 - 4 stars.  Reason - tasted good   - Stewed Streaky Pork - two diners order it   - diner 1 - 2.5 stars.  Reason - it tasted bland   - diner 2 (me) - 4 stars.  Reason - the pork was quite soft.  It was less salty than the original stewed pork.  I suspect that the chef changed the recipe to cater to the health conscious trend, though I don't know why a health conscious diner would even order this entrée.  The value was outstanding, as the portion was generous for $10.99,  Two of us doggy bagged leftover.    The average of 7 ratings is 3.7.  I round it up to 4 stars because the Bubble Grape Black Tea I had was not too sweet.  It also costed only $4.99 for 500ml.  Note that this group of diners is diverse in ethnic background, age and regular cuisines at home.  Some have dined at another Go For Tea before, and some have not."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrifying- ordered stir fried green beans but the green beans were rotten!!(seems  To be sitting there for ages)."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times and I really like the food and drinks BUT today made me think twice about coming back due to food safety and inspection. I ordered the lunch special combo with pork as I was eating the bok choy I felt I was chewing on a egg shell so I eventually find it and pick it out it was a small piece of sharp plastic! I almost swallowed it I thought it wasn't a big deal but after eating the 2nd piece I find another one which was even bigger Toronto public health inspectors need to really check this out because if this were to happen to a child this would've been a serious choking hazard!  I have a picture of what it was and the size  This issue needs to be addressed to the chefs & owner of this place because this has shown me that they are not washing their produce properly and that there is no proper food safety handling"}
{"text":"All the reviews referring to the bad service here weren't kidding. The employees could careless about this place. When I asked for water, the Asian girl with bleached blonde hair made an annoyed grunt and said ok. When ordering, the guy taking my order didnt know anything about their food items or drinks.   \"Hello, Is your Lemon Green Tea made with real lemon or lemon syrup?\"  *shrugs* \"I dont know, I think it's real.\"  \"Do you recommend your taro toast or the sesame toast?\" \"I dont know, havent tried either.\"  ... HmmMm I'm thinking in my head \"couldnt you at least tell me which one is more popular?\"  The staff here does not know what \"boba\" is... ask for Tapioca or Pearls (in Chinese) which is the lingo they use.  Bad service, you will have to flag someone down to order or get anything you need. Employees doesnt care, doesnt give a damn. They will ignore you when you enter and exit the restaurant. Loud clubbing music that will give you a headache. Drinks are very mediocre to bad. Not impressive for the prices they charge."}
{"text":"Lots of variety to choose from, could get overwhelming.   Food is tasty overall which is important.   Service I usually don't comment on because this is not that type of place however is very inconsistent.   Some staff are really helpful some look like they don't want to be there.    Decor in Markham is also very nice and comfortable."}
{"text":"I like the location and ambiance of this place. It's a nice place to meet up and mingle with friends. However the food needs some improvements.  I got a milk tea with jelly grass; common drink at bubble tea place. I was quite disappointed with the drink, lacking favour. Jelly grass didn't taste fresh. My friend got a slice of tiramisu cake; it was acceptable; decent price for $6. Condense milk toast was crisp and yummy; can't go wrong with this at an Asian cafe.  Overall nice place to hang out with friends but I wish the food was better."}
{"text":"This place is very dimly lit. I understand it's meant to set a mood, but it was just very dark in here and hard to see. This location is pretty spacious, and the seating arrangement looks cool, but the seats themselves are actually kinda uncomfortable.   I came here with a friend who ordered what I believe was the Taiwanese sausage rice. It was very simply arranged, but I personally found it average in taste. I only ordered a green apple bubble tea while my friend got the peanut butter one. These were good. My friend's drink actually tasted like peanut butter. I found that really amusing. The sizes come in regular or large, and if you're dining in, come in these huge mugs. For dessert, my friend ordered the creme brûlée, which was small but tasty.   I also ordered a milk green tea with tapioca to go for another friend. It costs 80 cents for the tapioca which I found to be really expensive for just tapioca.   This place is pricey for what is basic food and drink. I don't know if I'd return."}
{"text":"honestly, way over priced.. came here on several occasions because friends wanted to meet up there and i did not want to object.... there always seems to be a wait.. even when many tables are free.. service is not great.. sometimes servers are nowhere to be found.. they have a button for service which i pressed several times and noone came for 15 minutes.    did i mention this place is overpriced?  this location would be one of my last choices for bubble tea in terms of price, darkness, and service."}
{"text":"The food here is better than Destiny. Came in here late afternoon for some snacks. Fast Wifi, maybe slow crowd?  Ordered some hot tea ($5/cup), it's good.   The fried intestine was YUMMMY.   Mango cheesecake was fantastic. Took two waiters to finally get us the dessert!! SEriously, how hard is it?"}
{"text":"I've grabbed bubble teas to go several times here, recently I actually dined in only because my boyfriend's friends had chosen the place.  Got a special that night \"Streaky beef\" the name did not sound appetizing whatsoever. However it was a basic box/combo compared to the other specials (I'm a picky eater). It had beef, rice, salad & soup, which were all decent; nothing amazing. Also got a large Taro bubble tea, which was fine too. Again nothing spectacular, just the same quality as mall bubble tea. Not too sure what my boyfriend got but as for food portions, they were small and their menu is totally overpriced.   Let it be known that it took FOREVER to order because they are clearly not trained to provide customer service. The servers would stand together and just talk, they did not check on their tables. They only attended to us after being waved at or called for.   When it came to pay, my group of 7 asked for split bills (which they messed up 3 times)-- this wasn't the worst part though!! When they finally got it right we noticed they sprung a fixed tip because of our group size. After we all paid individually the server that brought the card machine flipped on us telling us \"you know you didn't tip??\" \"You didn't add any tip when you paid?\" He said this several times to my group and we were like \"yeah we know..\" He then left, when he came back to clear the table we told him that he already included the tip. And he was still pissed that we didn't add anything additional. Excuse you, that is optional and reflective of service. This server turned me off from ever coming here again. DON'T BOTHER."}
{"text":"When all else fails around the area and im hungry, Go For Tea is my go-to. It is somewhat decently priced, you get seated quickly (as long as you dont come after dinner hours), and the food comes rather quickly. I usually get the popcorn chicken on rice and a hot taro milk tea. The chicken portion is way more than enough for me - it is a pretty good portion, as it does come with couple of \"appetizers\" - usually a springroll cut into 3 pieces and a side veg. I dont tend to sit around and chit-chat here as most people seem like enjoy doing. I am usually in and out within an hour. And if its closer to dinner time, it can get pretty loud and I dont quite enjoy that kind of atmosphere.  I have no complaints about this place. I think the food - both quality and quantity are worth the price you pay, as well as for the amount of service. The staff here are pretty friendly. It is what it is - a bubble tea place, really ."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but why was the spring roll cold?  Waitress staffs was not friendly at all.  Seems like they don't enjoy working there.  Asked about lunch special and their respond was what ever is in the menu. Better respond would be, Yes, it in the menu.  They hide the lunch special in the middle of the menu so with the original respond my assumption was there no specials.   Also not sure if they ate intentionally doing this or not but they are overcharging by applying the wrong rounding rules.  $10.99 + HST is $12.42 by CC or $12.40 by cash.  Look at their bill, they will charge you $12.45 by cash or CC.   Pretty sure that is against the law but who is going to argue over a few penny.  Over a year that amount will add up for them."}
{"text":"Go For Tea is a good spot to come with friends on an evening for some food and drinks. The atmosphere is pretty chill with dimmed lights and soft background music. Normally I order a dinner set and a bubble tea. Their prices are fair and service is normally quick. There's also a button you can press if you need service."}
{"text":"TLDR: Service is terrible, they will literally toss things at you. Food is mediocre. But, very spacious and a good spot to catch up with friends.    Are you around the area and looking for a some Taiwanese chicken, maybe a cup of bubble tea, or a place to catch up with your friends? This just might be the place that offers the above things. But if you're looking for good service, you will get none here. The waiters/waitresses all seem to hate their jobs... we asked for water three times before having our glasses tossed on our table, we asked for a take out box which was also tossed on our table, we asked for a plastic bag to come with the take out box, which was tossed at our table... what is with the tossing!! They took our orders without making eye contact, they stared at the card machine as we paid... this place has so much potential to be so much more than it currently is....  Anyways, about the food. I ordered their dinner set menu - Thai chicken, it was okay, similar to the Taiwanese chicken you can get outside, just drenched with Thai sauce, it was a bit salty and saucey for my liking.  My friend also commented on their Taiwanese noodle and said they added too much soy sauce, so the noodles were drenched. Just stop tossing my things, and I'll maybe consider visiting again."}
{"text":"With a wide variety of tasty food and sweet drinks, fast and friendly service, high ceilings with classy ambience, and an open concept washroom, Go For Tea is one of my favorite, relaxing (and even quite romantic) cafe-restaurant hangout. Try their chocolate brownie cheesecake... It's a craving to satisfy."}
{"text":"A great go to place for bubble tea in big beer mugs, variety of shave ice and hot food.  Interesting Pricing plan on key hot food dishes , goes down in price the more dishes you order.  Interior settings of night club / modern clean restaurant. Helpful friendly staff."}
{"text":"I make a trip to go for tea everytime I visit Toronto. The drinks doesn't taste as they did before. Lineup can be very long so get ready for a wait."}
{"text":"I like the ambience of the place because it is quite quiet and a nice place to hang out with friends. It is also quite spacious and clean. However, we ordered the blueberry slush, and I was a bit disappointed. It was quite sugary and just tasted like juice with ice. I didn't get to try the bubbletea this time. However, I did find the space very comfortable especially when I had a stroller and a toddler there. We had a private room which was really nice of them. I also saw a lot of people having hot pot there and I didn't know that they offered such an option there which is neat."}
