{"text":"Suggested by my (Japanese descendant) coworker and being a ramen fan myself, I decided to try out this place, We went for dinner at 6:30 and the line up wasn't too bad, around 20min or so. The place is pretty small and of course crowded... we had party of two and both had the signature Toroniku Ramen. The ramen noodle was great with chewy texture. Broth was a bit too salty for me, I tried the broth for both orders, yes both were salty for me. You can ask for less salt, but I thought I should go for the 'original' on my first try. Next time I will ask for the less salt option for sure. The pork on the side was beef cheek I believe, it was so so good! tender and juicy. When my noodle was brought up, I thought the portion was not too big. But surprisingly I felt really full afterwards, maybe it's the soup...   Yes it's on the pricy side for ramen (~$40/2 ppl), but worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm not saying that the ramen bad but compared to competitors in the area (walking distance) it's definitely not the best. I don't like the noodles especially, they're yellow and thin and quite different from the regular ramen noodles.... More like the Chinese egg noodles. Soup was okay but portion size also smaller than regular. I would drop by again if I'm really craving ramen and it's within a 5 min walking distance and what not"}
{"text":"Hello Santouka... we meet again. Multiple times!  So since moving to Toronto, I had no idea that the ramen revolution that was rampant when I was growing up in Vancouver has taken hold of Toronto recently.  As per usual Santouka maintains the same kind of standards I've come to expect over the years. I've eaten Santouka ramen in Yokohama, Hokkaido, Vancouver and finally Toronto. I am amazed at the level of taste and authenticity they are able to recreate from location to location. This particular location on my two visits tasted a little saltier than what I've gotten used to over the years though...  I've yet to try the other ramen shops around Toronto as I never really wanted to take on the risk of trying something I don't know. BUT having said that I can't completely crown Santouka the king of ramen in this town until I've given the competition a fair shake! Off to Sansotei then..."}
{"text":"I have tasted better ramen. I went there alone and ordered their upscale pork ramen. The waiter did not come back and checked on me even once!"}
{"text":"Best ramen in the city. Limited selection but what's there is gold. Also great option to size up or down on portions so you're never too full or hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"The whole noodle was amazing! The soup in the noodles had lots of flavor, the noodles had the texture I liked and the place had a happy environment   But I didn't really like to wait outside... The place was happy and cheerful but the place was puny and squished up... Not a place to sit and chat... More like a eat and go kind of thing... Over all I liked it and would recommend to eat it by yourself or with a few friends... Don't eat to long though!"}
{"text":"Originating in Japan, this restaurant chain is all over the world! Hong Kong, the USA, Thailand, and Canada are a few of the places they offer their hearty bowls of ramen.  During peak hours, the restaurant usually has a huge lineup. You should be prepared to wait up to 30 minutes, depending on how many people are in front of you.  We love the miso and kara miso ramen. When you look at the menu in person at the restaurant, you will be shown many more types of ramen: hot, cold, spicy, extra noodles, hand-dipping, combos... the variety is quite large! But, the main broths are the four types shown on the website, and many of the different types of ramen still revolve around the main broths.  Our gyoza was brought quite fast despite the business of the restaurant, and it was delicious. Piping hot inside, it was even better with the three types of sauces: soy sauce, chili sauce, and white vinegar. Ken and I made our own sauce by mixing them. I recommend mixing soy sauce and chili sauce if you want a kick!  I usually get their miso or kara miso (spicy miso) ramen, but on our visit this weekend, the restaurant had introduced a new special ramen, limited edition! The broth to this ramen was infused with ginger giving a healthy kick. The spiciness of the ginger is what gives the ramen its kick; it tastes more herbal in flavour. They only offer 20 bowls of it a day, so if you really want to try it, make sure to go early enough! I'm not sure if they offer it anymore, since it is March (I last visited in January). The pork in the ramen is very soft and full of its flavour. It was definitely worth trying the limited edition ramen because you can probably only get it at this location. I would recommend this ramen for those who have a cold, the flu, or generally feeling under the weather.  My husband loves their Kara Miso Ramen, which is a nice mix of their miso ramen with spice. The popular ramen can be chosen to be a combo with one of their mini rice bowls. There are four types of rice bowls, with the Ikura Roe Rice bowl being our favourite. The size of the roe! It is so big...you can feel and taste it pop in your mouth, filling your taste buds with flavour and surprise! The flakes of fresh egg underneath the inure roe also mixes very well, making it tastier overall.  The kara miso ramen also comes with soft pork just like the winter special ramen. Ken says it is one of the best ramens he had tasted so far in Toronto. I haven't taken him to all of the ramen restaurants because we like to stick to the ones we know we like for awhile before we venture out to try a new place. Ken mentioned that the kara miso was a little salty for his taste, so he said that he will ask them to be easy on the salt when he orders it the next time we are there.  If you're feeling a little blue, or need something to keep you warm for the rest of the freezing winter, I recommend you to stop by for a bowl of Santouka ramen! Get there a little early, so that you don't have to wait!"}
{"text":"Best ramen place in toronto! They do have quite a bit of line up but if you pick the right time you can usually get a seat within 15 min. The boiled egg is a just \"add-on\"!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended, went there around 7pm and there is a line (~10 minutes or so not too bad), it is a small restaurant, the tables/seats are next to others but noodles is great, the portion of food is good.  However, I have yet visit other noodles place in Toronto as our time is limited.. can only use the noodles place in the Cleveland area.  The price is reasonable, the only thing is parking sucks... as a tourist even I parked across the street (paid ticket) and I still got a parking ticket for $50."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the best Ramen place in Toronto.  I've been to Kenzo, Kinton, Momofuku, Ajisen, and Ramen Raijin (haven't tried Sansotei yet).   Broth is rich; noodles are just the right thickness and firmness; portion size is just right... but what really puts Santouka over the top of the other places is the sliced pork cheek. This is a must have whenever going to Santouka."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Santouka since I first tried it in the Misuwa food court in NJ so I was happy that they have finally decided to come to Toronto.   I have tried all the other ramen places in Toronto and I have to say that Santouka is the best among the wide selection of Japanese ramen houses in Toronto, but its no Ippudo.  Let me first clarify that my ramen of choice has always been the miso infused variety and NYC Ippudo's Akamaru Modern ranks among the best I have tried but Santouka comes close but not that close.   My only gripe with this place is the long wait.  Given the popularity of ramen in Toronto and the number of patrons that are so willing to line up for some ramen everyday they should expand or open another location so that everyone enjoy some great Hokkaido ramen without having to wait in the bitter cold!"}
{"text":"I would rather go to Sansotei ramen instead.  Will not visit this place again.  Food: 1/5 Service: 4/5 Value: 2/5  I ordered the shio ramen. The soup is WAY too salty, and I cannot drink all the soup at all. (I was totally fine with the other ramen places tho) The bamboo shoots also is weird and has a really strong taste that covers pretty much everything else except salt.  However, the service is great. My ramen and drink came within two minutes of my order and the place is not empty at the time. The waitress even gave me a basket to put my bag and jacket in. The workers are all very energetic. The only flaw i found was that she gave me the bill before i finished the my ramen...  Overall, the ramen is $13 and the food is very much not worth it. There are many places better (and cheaper!) than this one."}
{"text":"Spicy Miso Ramen and flaked salmon don combo set ($22.50) was a good deal in a way.  Portions were adequate and filling.  Salmon Don was dry and bland.  The rice went wrong, was in a paste-like texture.  However, the ramen was delicious.  It was sweet miso soup, slowly progressed into the fresh ingredients salt mixture and into the spiciness.  Enjoyed the dimension of flavours the soup base provided.  Though, I do not mind it being more spicy.  Toroniku Ramen ($12.95) is their signature ramen, where the ramen and toppings were served separately.  Toroniku is simmered pork cheek (jowl) meat.  It has rich flavour - fresh, sweet, soy sauce saltiness and soft, melt in your mouth texture, like fat.  By dipping the meat in the broth, the meat absorbs the broth and brings out the character of both parties.  Shoyu soup is made from a mixture of pork bones broth and soy sauce.  It takes 2 days of boiling and simmering to complete, making the soup extra sweet, creamy, smooth and rich in pork aroma. you will not get sick of this broth.  Overall, both soups were not salty and can continuously drink it, thinking it is the healthiest thing ever.  It did not feel fat and did not notice a layer of oil floating at the top.  Definitely has a better soup base than others.  The thick strands of noodles Santouka used benefited the soup base.  Other than being al dente, texture was firm, the noodles swam in the bowl of delicious soups, absorbing the essence of the soup base. It was a scrumptous meal."}
{"text":"My current favorite ramen place. You can get extra noodles and they even offer extra lard (??) if that's your thing.   It's kinda small and always packed but there's a good reason for that. It's amazing."}
{"text":"If there were negative stars, I'd issue it. First of all, the service was terrible and the food over priced. The food isn't even as good as other ramen shops. Not to mention, they charge a minimum of $9.95 if you don't order anything! Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"I've been to Momofuku, and it was okay. But here's how I know Santouka is my place.  Both smelled lovely walking in. My first taste of the broth in Momofuku was heaven. But every bite after that was like eating a stick of butter. It sat in my gut like lead and it wasn't pleasant.   At Santouka, the first taste was nothing special. But spoonful after spoonful, the Salt Ramen broth showed itself to be much more complex and pleasing. By the 3rd spoonful, I was hooked on the delicious flavor. The noodles were perfectly cooked, and the serving was quite generous. (I had the salt ramen with double cha shu.)  Didn't love the bamboo shoots (they had that iodine flavor that most bamboo shoots seem to have...from a can?) but loved everything in my bowl. I'm sure there is better Ramen somewhere, but in Toronto, this is my go-to place now."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now.  Food is always fresh and hot and the service is blazingly fast and friendly.  Presentation is nice too, which adds a bit of Japanese authenticity to the experience.  I haven't tried all the different ramens - I just stick with the standard \"shio\" type every time.  My only gripe is with beer pricing.  The large Asahi draft beer is more expensive on a per volume basis than the smaller draft. (20oz $8.50 and 16oz $6.50).  Not enough to deduct a full star, so 5 stars it is on this one."}
{"text":"Santouka is easily the best ramen spot in Toronto (which is saying a lot given the amount of ramen shop openings in the past year). Without fail, one will always find a lineup outside, and for good reason. The wait is totally worth it.  I have been here several times, and have always gotten the Toroniku Shio Ramen. The meat comes separately from the noodles and is super tender and full of fatty goodness. You can also adjust the amount of lard in your broth, as well as the softness of your noodles.  The last time I was here I decided to be adventurous and try the Kara Miso Ramen. I will be going for this bowl from now on since it was really good!  This place is much more expensive than your average ramen at $15/bowl, but I would say that the tastiness justifies the price."}
{"text":"OK ramen, a bit $$   I decided to go early at 11:30 am and luckily I did, because by 11:45, the place was packed with a line-up starting to form out the door. The menu is extensive, and a little overwhelming, but thankfully they have good descriptions so you know what you're ordering. Although I said I wouldn't do it again (given how gross I felt after Sansotei), I went for their signature dish: Tokusen Toroniku Ramen but asked for it to be less fatty and salty. Good to know you can order it this way.  The toppings were served on the side, and what makes this dish extra special is that the meat is simmered pork cheek (jowl). This dish is very rare, therefore quantities are limited - first come, first served. Well, I will agree that the pork melted in my mouth...super tender. It was kind of fun to dress up the soup noodles as I wished with the accompanying black fungus, green onions, bamboo shoots, and some orange ball (if I remember correctly, seemed anise-like). It was a tasty dish for sure, but once again, I felt like a lump of potatoes afterwards. This broth is just too rich for my palate.   And at $16 a pop, well I don't think I'll be having this on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Ramen places in Toronto. It has the best beef broth but I know it really depends on your preference on how oily you like it. My go-to place when I crave Ramen."}
{"text":"If I don't get here once every 2 weeks I get serious withdrawal. The BEST ramen in Toronto, hands down. It's small & busy with sweet servers; where all staff welcome you out loud and also say goodbye in unison.  Was at Momofuko last week to try something different, and was sadly disappointed. The basic ramen with pork jowl slices is heavenly. You get s choice of 'salt' 'soy sauce' 'miso' or 'spicy miso' large pots of pork broth dimmer all day in the open kitchen."}
{"text":"You know when sometimes pork is boiling and it has a bad smell, the taste of the ramen broth I had was equivalent to that.   I had the shio char siu ramen with extra roast pork and my first impression of it when it was placed in front of me was the underwhelming portion. The size of the bowl was small and the char siu pieces were small too.   According to Santouka's website, their char siu ramen \"is a substantial bowl of ramen piled high with a precious amount of pork roasted to the point of falling apart\".   None of this was true.   The char siu wasn't even close to falling apart as the tenderness was a 7.5/10 at best. It also didn't come with an egg unlike other ramen spots and they charged extra for it. As mentioned above, I found the broth to be terrible. I wasn't a fan of the bamboo shoot taste as well. What made my visit to Santouka great however was the service. The staff was friendly and quick.   Overall, the ramen was disappointing and wasn't worth the $15+. Kinton, Sansotei, and Kenzo are much better places to have tasty ramen that will leave you full. Unfortunately, I left hungry and unsatisfied at Santouka."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Ramen I've ever had!  Service - Great, it is a quick and friendly environment Price - Affordable Quality - Never disappoints me Decor - It's cozy, open concept.. you'll be sitting close to others though as it gets really packed!"}
{"text":"Woooo, yelpers, this place is really special. The place is nice and clean and the food was fantastic!  I'm glad that we came to this place, worth every penny we spent there.  The service here is also exceptional! My order had a small mix up, but it was quickly corrected. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here, and I will definitely try to go back more often."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I last dined at Santouka, so my boyfriend and I decided to have ramen at Santouka last night. Out of all the ramen shops in downtown Toronto, Sansotei and Santouka are my faves.  The Toroniku Shio Ramen was the best! The white tonkotsu soup was rich and creamy. The pork cheek was totally melt-in-your-mouth soft. It was comfort food at its finest.   We also ordered the Kara Miso Ramen (spicy miso) + Ikura Don (salmon roe rice bowl) combination. Not to say it didn't taste good, but neither of us felt the spicy miso soup was special and unfortunately, the rice was overcooked.  Sadly, I noticed the prices have changed since my last visit. It cost us $18.40 per order! Although the food was great, I can't say what we ate was worth 20 something dollars per person (after tax and tips).  Service is quick and friendly, but do expect a bit of a wait. We stopped by just before 6 o'clock on a Thursday evening and we still waited about 20 minutes for a table. It is in the heart of downtown, close to Eaton Centre and Ryerson University, after all!"}
{"text":"After living in Japan, it's quite difficult to find a ramen place that measures up.  Santouka does a pretty decent job with their ramen options.   They don't take reservations and people line up for an hour to get food here, so if you are going, try to get there early.  The shoyu ramen is tasty.   The quality of the noodle and broth is good.  Sitting at the bar reminded me of the ramen shops they have in Japan.  My friend mentioned the spicy ramen wasn't as good as the shoyu.  If you want extra meat, it only costs about $1-2 more.  I don't think I'd wait that long for this ramen again.  It's good, but not 1 hour line-up-long-kind-of-good.  Expect to pay around $9 - $18 for ramen."}
{"text":"Nice ramen place! Classic and simple menu. Can't claim to be an expert but enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Amazing! Got there at 12pm on a Thursday afternoon and there was already a line up! I think it took us roughly 15-20 minutes to get a seat inside (which isn't too bad). The broth was amazing and rich! I asked for less salt and it was perfection. And the meat just melted in your mouth! Santouka broth is better than Sansotei, Kinton and Kenzo.  This is probably the best ramen in downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"Staying nearby during a forced layover (thanks aircanada), I discovered this place. Wow, the lunch was out of sight. Ramen was very good. I'm definitely coming back when I'm in town. Locals should feel lucky--this is dynamite!"}
{"text":"My first impression of Santouka is that they have really nice and attentive service. The servers in attendance on the night I dined there listened to me well, made sure they got my order correct and offered to help split the sake, dessert and the bill between my dining companion and I. It was very considerate of them.  My second impression would be their pork belly. I've been a loyal Sansotei Ramen fangirl, but I would say Santouka serves better pork belly. Their slices are thicker, nice & tender, and have a nice marbling of fat.  Their seasonal sweet potato dish is ok. Nothing too special. It's like a small paste of mashed oriental sweet potato served with two thin slices of apple.   Overall a nice experience. I ordered their Miso Rame"}
{"text":"A very small restaurant that doesn't seat many. There's always a line up and the tables are filled slowly even with the long line ups.   Now onto the food, I ordered gyoza and shio ramen. The gyozas were alright, definitely not bad. The ramen was cooked really well but portions were small and didn't come with the boiled egg like other places. Apparently that comes only with the combo meals. I had to rush my order so I didn't get a chance to go through the menu thoroughly.   Would I go back? Maybe if there wasn't a stupid line up all times of the day."}
{"text":"Waited for 1hr outdoor in a windy winter night. I would probably left if my family were not feel like look for another restaurant.  But thank god the food is worth it.   The broth is so Rich and smells amazing. Noodles were probably hand made. The texture is great. We order the popular pork cheek with ramen. Spicy miso ramen. Dumpling. Don (rice). And many other little things. It came off close to 90 with 4 of us.   I would recommended the ramen and pork cheek. Also their eggs are really good. Dumpling on the other hand not so much. There meat Lacks flavor and outside skin was not crunchy either. The rice/don was okay. I would stick with ramen with egg next time and try to find a less busy time so I don't have to wait in the cold."}
{"text":"?????????????  ?????????????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????  ????????????????...??4??"}
{"text":"I like the ramen.... The miso broth was delicious with perfectly cook noodles....  Atmosphere is good and casual... Good for quick bowl of ramen during rainy day......"}
{"text":"Amazing, the broth was delicious and that little pickled something was amazing .... order the shiro ramen if you are confused ... so so good"}
{"text":"You definitely get bang for your buck here. Best ramen I've ever had, hands down. There's always a little bit of a line, but have never waited over 25 minutes.   Service is always nice and friendly and the portions you get are a great size (even though I always get a regular size serving).   My go-to place when Downtown for the night!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite raman place...dare I say even better than Ippudo NY? I have been here multiple times and my go to is Kara miso (spicy raman)it is el dente and not too spicy. The Ikura (Salmon roe) on top of rice and egg is also very good...with a bit of fish sauce on the rice. The Toronku (pork cheek) is also good and very tender -doesn't even feel like you are eating pork. The place is always packed, as its not very large place. I find arriving at 5-5:30 is the trick to not having to wait for a table. Definately on the pricier side for raman, but soo good i can't resist coming back."}
{"text":"You should wait and come back another time... They opened Nov 10th with a limited menu. I visited Nov 21st and ordered a disappointing Shoyu ramen. Maybe they're still working out the kinks because the ramen I had at the Vancouver Santouka was much better.   The broth was WELL seasoned. Flavourful but also too salty. If I wanted salty, I'd order a shio ramen...  Pork was overcooked...   sigh.. disappointed Santouka.. so disappointed."}
{"text":"The most important thing is don't ever order any alcoholic beverages at this place. They gave u a shot of sake and charged u 7 bucks!! The size of the shot, even if u double it and it won't even equal to half a glass... Complete rip off! I'm from California and our living standard isn't that low. For 10 bucks u should a glass of alcohol and at least to get a bit of buzz... Not here...  For ramen, it's ok. It's not bad but not wonderful. Ipudo in NYC is better.   I would have given 3.5 or 4 stars but the overpriced alcoholic beverages is very Unsatisfying... Sighing"}
{"text":"I don't have much experience with ramen, but I can definitely say that Santouka makes some good noodles! The texture is chewy and delicious. The pork meat was mouth-watering! The broth, however, was a little salty. But all in all, it was a pretty darn good bowl of ramen.   The place gets super busy, and you don't get seated unless your whole party is there. Their servers are very friendly; they make the ramen experience that much greater! The building's exterior looks like an old, brick building, but the interior is very modern and sleek. I will see you soon, Santouka!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I arrived late this past Sunday night at around 8:45 pm and waited only 10 minutes for a table (score!). It's a small, but a very bright and open space. With such limited seating I can only imagine how long the wait for a table would be during peak hours.  The selection was pretty small since it's only a soft opening. I ordered the Shio Ramen - it was love at first taste! The Shio broth is rich and complex, without being overly salty. The pork is hands down the tastiest I've had compared to other ramen shops. The noodles were delicious and cooked to perfection. I only wish i had a bigger bowl! The portions were pretty small and the prices were expensive in relation. I personally don't mind dishing out the extra money to enjoy an exceptional bowl of ramen every now and then, but something tells me that my fellow Torontonians may be less inclined to when they can get reasonably priced ramen elsewhere.  For hearty eaters, I'm afraid a regular bowl of ramen won't be enough to satisfy you. They do offer the option for more meat and additional toppings, but at a cost of course. Despite the small portions the great flavours won me over. I'm hoping for some great apps to help fill the void when they officially open in late November. I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"I have been a longtime visitor of both its Vancouver location (for many years) and then its Toronto one. It used to be one of my top preferred ramen places. However, in my last visit to this Toronto location with my two family members, the experience was the worst - it was kind of late at night and we waited for about 15 minutes before we were seated. Both I and another family member were hungry and ready to order a lot, while the other senior family member was not hungry and therefore did not need to eat. When we were ready to order, the staff told us that there was a minimum per person requirement; I explained to her that my senior family member was not able to eat at 10pm of the day, but both I and my other family member would order a lot (well exceeding three people's minimum $ amount in total) to \"make up\" for that. Nonetheless, the staff insisted on the minimum per person requirement and said we could LEAVE if we do not want to eat here. We indeed agreed that we would not eat with such a terrible and rude service and we left. This was and will always be my last ever visit to this place."}
{"text":"This is another one of those... PLAN YOUR DAY restaurants. The line-ups start early / promptly at 12-noon.  But that ramen... that ramen is delicious.  One of my favourites in the downtown core.  If you're not a fan of salt, you ask for low salt..."}
{"text":"The ramen here is A+, super chewy noodles, really rich and flavourful broth. All the staff there speak Japanese so that's when you know this joint is legit. I went at 1:30 on a Saturday and the line was not too bad, but after we sat down the line had extended to outside the store...honestly though it's worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Japanese ramen for really reasonable price. I love that they let you pick your level of lard and salt because that really came in handy. When it comes to ramen I never liked ordering miso or soy base because I'm not keen to slurping my ramen in too much salt. But this place allowed the adjustment and also the noodle was mid thick that balance well with the soup. Staff was nice and accommodating as well! I had the Kara Miso Ramen which had a nice kick but not super spicy that you couldn't sip the ramen broth or had to drink constantly."}
{"text":"We felt like some ramen today. After having gone to both Kinton and Sansotei a few times,  we decided to try a place we haven't yet tried.  I have read about Hakkaido Ramen Santouka online and from a Toronto magazine which gave it a 2.5 star rating, making it 2 of the higher rated ramen places (the other being our favourite Sansotei), so this would be the one to try. But it was a disaapointment! Big time. First off, prices are much higher than either Kinton or Sansotei down a few blocks. I ordered their Shoyu ramen after confirming that it has the creamiest broth of all of the choices.  My hubby ordered Miso Ramen.  They came and my first thought was it looked kinda small and even just based on looks something was missing. It didn't include a soft boiled egg! (whereas many ramen in Kinton or Sansotei included the lovely soft boil egg).  Yes I;m sure you can pay even more to add it.  Anyways. onto the broth: at first it was really good as it Was creamy and not overdoing the salt as Shoyu is a salt based broth. After about half way through, i started to taste the noodle starchiness in the broth. Ramen is made with Alkaline noodle much like the Cantonese Wonton noodles. For those of u who have had wonton noodles, there is a strong taste to the noodle due to the way it is made in this alkaline liquid. The noodle from Santouka has some of that taste which just didn't go well in a bowl of ramen! I didn't like that at all.  The taste of the whole ramen was lacking complexity and not to mention the pork slices were among the smallest compared to the ones from the other places. So in summary, lack of a rich complex taste, very little side ingredients, very little pork belly, no egg and a much higher price has this place fall way below in ranks compared to the other (also popular) places. Infact, not even sure why this place is sooo popular!    Next time, we will stick with Sansotei which is still the best. Kinton and Momofuku ramen are also better choices in my opinion."}
{"text":"Good ramen noodles. The soups are all flavorful. The seats are not too comfortable though because the place is not big. In fact, it's rather small. Waiting for a table is not unusual at all but food is good."}
{"text":"Is it good? The simple answer is No. why? Cuz it's just an average noodles place.   Went there with friends on a sat night. The waiting line was crazy! Finally we got a table but the waitress was really pushy! It's like you are supposed to be ready for what to order before u sit down.....   Let's talk about the food. I ordered the shio ramen. To my surprise it came with really tiny bowl. Even the bag of instant noodles you buy from grocery has more noodles than that..... and it's 12.45 bucks, ouch! Does it taste good though? No, not at all...... soup taste like straight MSG. Got super thirsty after the meal. Friends ordered some side appetizers, really average ......    Would I come back? No. Never"}
{"text":"Their ability to accommodate large groups here is horrible. But at least they did everything with a smile.   We had a group of 10. They wouldn't seat us when we arrived because we were missing 4. Our group was whole 5 minutes later. But the hostess wouldn't believe it and had to do a head count. She then seated us at 4 tables with a bench and 4 chairs, expecting us to squeeze 6 onto the bench.   We were given 6 menus. Then the server took one of our menus because they were short for other tables.  We got our food very quickly after we ordered. I got the Kara Miso Ramen. It was pretty tasty. Not overly spicy. The broth was full of flavour. Noodles were a little more al dente than I like but it was still enjoyable. I had a taste of the other broths. I think I chose right. Overall tasty food but pricey. Not sure I'll come back."}
{"text":"A lot of people, we were there at 8pm but still had to wait. I ordered combo which is recommended, you can select which type of ramen in your combo and  it's pricy."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the past two weeks! I had the shio ramen last time and ordered the spicy miso ramen this time. The shio is the mildest in flavour and would be perfect for those who prefer lower sodium. The spicy miso was a great and cleared my sinuses (stupid cold...) Both times I've ordered the salmon roe on rice as part of the combo, which I might actually like more than the ramen. Service is prompt and friendly, as long as you get in before the lines form outside."}
{"text":"2 stars and there are reasons.  The ramen was ok. I like the noodles as it wasn't too soft and I like being able to bite my noodles. The soup was ok nothing to complain about but nothing to rant and rave about either.  Waiting a long time for it was just not worth it. Not for the price. It is really just over priced without really delivering anything to make you want to go back. If waiting outside for noodle is your thing walk the short distance to Sansotei and pay less."}
{"text":"I had a visitor from LA and he wanted to come try this since he liked the one back home.  We both loved it.  I have been here multiple times since.  Very good ramen!"}
{"text":"Anyone who says Sansotei ramen is better than this place is just, well, wrong. Anyone who thinks Kinton's ramen, hipster-wanna-be hangout, popular just cause, ugh, paaalease, is any good is dead wrong. Check your taste buds at the door if you're eating Kinton, what do they call it, oh ya, \"ramen\".  No sir, sit me down with a large bowl of kara miso toroniku ramen, with a what? an egg? Oh ya, drop that in dare! Accompany that with a tall, creamy glass of Asahi Super dry - sugei umai!  This place gets a thumbs up for ramen in Canada - not the best I've ever had, but, hey, it's Canada. If you want real ramen and real Asahi super dry, head to Japan. For those that can't make that trip, go to Hokkaido on Dundas. Just sayin.  Oh, if you want gyozza, don't bother with Hokkaido, head West on Dundas and pay a visit to Kenzo ramen. Don't order their ramen though...barn swill. Their gyozza however is by far the best you'll have in the city.  If Hokkaido's ramen and Kenzo's gyozza were ever to meet in a super Japanese restaurant it would be like peanut butter and chocolate coming together, so delicious."}
{"text":"I still love Kinton and Ramen Isshen. But Santouka by far blows them out of the water. Couldn't decide what to get so I had the large size pork jowl and an order of spicy tsukemen. Crushed em both.   Pork jowl. Tenderest meat I've had with ramen. Bar none. Broth was perfect balance of spice. Noodles were a little thin for me as my preference is towards thicker chewy noodles.  Spicy pork tsukemen. Spicy. The fact that you can customize the spice even more makes it that much better. The charsu was good. Not mind blowing but good. Noodles were perfect. Chewy and cold waiting to be spiced and warm in the dipping broth.  We got here right when it opened and it was already busy. I can see why. Love this place. Currently number ranked in Toronto for me."}
{"text":"I went back after 10pm on sunday, which guaranteed us seats. I got their shio combo w/salmon rice and half egg. I also added the aji-tama(soft-boiled egg). The broth remains the same. Some may say its salty, some may say oily. I say its in between. My soft-boiled egg was soft, but not yolky like the last time. I didn't enjoy the chasu(pork meat) as it was too fatty for me. I prefer the bbq pork meat at Ajisan, as its thinly sliced and light on the fat...I do like that u can upsize ur noodles for $1 more.   The salmon rice is a small sample size bowl and its just standard to me...  I also got orange juice...Bill is $23+ before tips. The girl server is friendly and easy-going. May go back if I am craving ramen, but there are a few other places I could try to see if its comparable."}
{"text":"Service is prompt and staff are courteous. Ramen is not oily and taste great. Lots to choose from their menu unlike other ramen houses. They have more desserts to offer too!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this is rated as the best ramen noodles in Toronto. The soup was too salty, and you have to pay for the extras. I've had better ramen in Vancouver where you get everything in the bowl."}
{"text":"It's Ramen.  Kinda of a small shop, lots of turnover of customers so you won't be lingering long.  The ramen is about the same as other places in the city."}
{"text":"Santouka is fantastic Hokkaido style ramen in the GTA. Although it is a global restaurant chain, it is still very good compared to other ramen options in the GTA.  In my honest opinion once the quality of a ramen restaurant gets up to a certain level, whether one is better than the other is just personal preference.  Santouka is close by to the usual spots I go, so I tend to go their often.  Its great and for that price point you cant really go wrong."}
{"text":"Over salted broth was disappointing, not to mention the average pork. Not sure why there is a queue for this place, hopefully it was a bad night for them and that they can do better!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends. We had to wait around 40 minutes before being seated.  I had a green tea, gyoza, and shio ramen.  The gyoza were pretty standard. The ramen broth was creamier than I am used to. Not bad or good, just interesting. I asked for my noodles hard and they weren't hard enough.  Service was fast and friendly even if our server spoke a little too quietly to be heard.  Split between three who all got the same thing except drinks it was $25 each including tax/tip. I felt full and satisfied after. The long wait will probably prevent me from coming back.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"I decided to take an alternate route around the city and ended up spotting this little place from a streetcar. I texted a girlfriend of mine that we would have to try this place out the next time we made lunch plans.   I had lunch there today and it's a Monday. We arrived just minutes after the noon hour and within 10 minutes, all the tables were taken. Thankfully, we arrived just before the lunch rush.   The servers were helpful and explained the menu (I had never had ramen before). I decided on the Kara Miso Ramen and am happy I did. The portions are perfect - and noodles are generally filling anyway. The broth was creamy, perfectly spiced (hot enough to add to the flavour vs. overpowering it), but the pork pieces were nothing but fat. I like my pork like the next guy, but some actual meat would have been appreciated. Paying $12 for broth + noodles is a little steep. If there was a meaty component (vs. a fatty one), I would have been happier. All in all. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Had to wait til your whole party is here before you can be seated. Even when the only person left is walking in through the glass window!! They still let the next group get seated first. However I take enjoyed their ramen though."}
{"text":"They give you an option of a smaller portion size which is great if you can't eat the large bowl.  The pork is tender and delicious.  Even though the wait was a few minutes it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Came on Nov 21st around 6:15 and waited an hour to get into the restaurant. Thank goodness two big groups in front of me left or I would have had to wait longer! haha  Once we got seated, we knew what we wanted and ordered right away thanks to the menu that was outside the restaurant. I got the miso ramen combo with the green onions and bonita flakes side. The ramen was very flavourful and quite heavy without being overly salty. It did take some time for our order to come and from what I saw in the kitchen it seemed like the chefs were still getting into the groove of things. (I don't blame them since it's still only the soft opening).  Overall I think it was tasty and was at a decent price. Would def come back perhaps a little earlier to avoid the lines!"}
{"text":"Some frds from America recommended it to me. I ordered less salt noodle, but it is still tooooo salty. The bamboo shoots taste spoiled, and made me  have loose bowels."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen. Expect a wait and also a bit of rush service due to the constant lineup out the door. We (group of 4) waited 35 minutes on a Monday night. I passed by at 6pm to meet friends, and there was no line, but returned at 7pm to find a line already 30 minutes long. The sides seem rather expensive for what they are ($2 for corn?). The dishware is nice. The bowls and sides come on nearly circular plates that the servers align nicely on the table. It's a nice touch. Again, due to the lineup, the service was rushed. We had the check presented before I had finished my food. That was not the nicest experience. I'm being generous with the stars because I really liked the ramen. I will definitely return, but would pick an earlier time to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"Easily the saltiest ramen in Toronto. Been here a few times with friends and on dates but I was very put off by the amount of salt they use in their broth. I asked for half salt last time I was there but it was still extremely salty. For the health of my kidneys I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I won't go here again.  The food was decent but was very disappointed that we had to wait 20 mins to be seated when the restaurant was half empty - simply because two people from our party were not there yet.  When I asked if we could be seated, given that they were not busy, and that we'd like to start ordering food (and duh - SPENDING money in their restaurant) they still refused.  The other two guests were only 5 mins away at that point.  Had it not been for my high heels and aching feet, I would have gone to Kenzo or Sansotei down the street.   I get the rule about having your whole party there when the resto is busy, but a restaurant that can't bend the rules when they're not busy is asking for their customers to go elsewhere, and isn't a restaurant that cares about their clientele.  Look for another place that values your business and your money."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST PLACE FOR TASTY, DELICIOUS, CHEWY Ramen. The broth is flavourful, full of pork flavor stewed for a long time. The noodles are always perfectly cooked.   Worth the wait in line!"}
{"text":"With all the ramen shops in Toronto, I always have a hard time choosing which one to go to!  I went to Santouka on a Thursday morning around 11:30 and fortunately, I was able to avoid the line-ups! Seating is pretty limited since the location is small so I would advise you to come during non-peak hours if you want to be seated quickly. One thing I love about dining at Santouka is that you don't feel the cold air every time the door opens, unlike Sansotei.  I ordered the Miso Ramen ($11) and it was delicious! The pork was absolutely delicious and I love how they include bamboo shoots in their ramen. Their portions are a bit smaller than other ramen places but I find it absolutely perfect since I can finish it without feeling too full.   I also tried their gyoza (5 pieces for $5.50) but unfortunately, I just found them to be okay. They weren't very crispy and I probably wouldn't order them again.  They do impose a minimum spending limit of $10 per person which is understandable since they are pretty small. However, I don't think it's really fair to impose this rule when the restaurant is nearly empty..   Atmosphere: 4/5 | Service: 4/5 | Price: 5/5"}
{"text":"I came here on a friday night with 4 others, and the place was packed! There was a line outside, and we ended up waiting for 1.5 hrs! The restaurant is quite small, so it would be hard getting seats for larger groups. It was also disappointing seeing several groups of 2 being seated way before mine did. It would have been nice if they could rearrange smaller tables for us.   As for the food, I was quite satisfied. I ordered the Ikura Bowl Combo (Shoyu Soup Base) for $16.50. The Salmon Roe Rice was my favourite! I like the soup base for the ramen, but the noodles were not the best. The portion size is perfect though!   Overall, I was satisfied with my visit. I would be sure to come back again at a less busier time!"}
{"text":"I had the Shoyu Ramen, which was fairly tasty. The broth was very flavourful, yet not overly salty (which sometimes can be the case with Shoyu). It could have used a bit more seasoning, but my biggest complaint with the Ramen itself was that there were only two small pieces of chau siu given, which was very underwhelming given the amount of broth/noodles.  On flavour alone, it would be a 4-star review. However, I felt it was overpriced for Ramen (a regular was $12.45, a large $13.45), and it did not include a soft-boiled egg (you had to pay another $1.60 for it). So for me, while tasty, what amounted to ~$17 or so after tax was a steep price tag for Ramen. If it was a few dollars cheaper, it would easily be a 4-star."}
{"text":"We went here on their soft opening last Nov.  Had to line up for more than an hour before we were able to get in.  We ordered a tonkotsu shio ramen, tonkotsu shoyu ramen & an egg on the side.  The egg does not come standard with the ramen order (unlike other places).  We are looking forward to come back here to try other things on their menu since they were only serving limited items on their menu during the soft opening."}
{"text":"Long line up, ramen was a little salty, and price is slightly higher compared to other ramen spots."}
{"text":"Given Santouka is one of the \"big player\" in ramen industry in Japan(and they have since expanded overseas to HK, US, Singapore etc....), I have very high expectation on this ramen place but it doesn't turn out as good as i expected  From inside out they tried to use the same ingredients/noodles as their original store in Japan(even the same style of bowl in blue, and the quantity of noodle, pork etc......) However the noodle doesn't turn out as good as I imagine.  Not to get me wrong the egg noodle(ramen) is of high quality, very rich in egg flavour, but texture not as good as Kinton and Sansotei.  I was looking into the kitchen to see how they cook the noodle, and find out that the chef didn't drain out all the excess water after they cook the noodle, which is one of the key factor of affecting the texture of it.  The soup base is ok, not the best comparing to Sansotei, love the combo that comes with a bowl of rice with salmon roe on it, although a little pricy for that.  The pork is good too, very tender and juicy.  I did return for a 2nd time, but the noodle texture turns out to be exactly the same as first time which dissappoint me a bit~~"}
{"text":"Overall a great place. We went on a saturday morning at 11:00, so it was not too busy. The menu is not extensive, but its a good thing; they focus on the ramens, and the quality is good. I have been to many ramen places and this is one of the best."}
{"text":"I have been Santouka three times and will add to the overwhelming good opinion of this place.  The service is friendly, fast and efficient. I've had the shio ramen which is apparently the most popular. It's creamy and delicious and the noodles are perfectly cooked. I tried it with the pork jowl once and while it was very good, I found the pork jowl too fatty (although I recognize that's probably the idea). The miso ramen is also very good as are the pork dumplings. Yum!  The only frustrating thing I experienced was the hostess refusing to let us sit down without the other person in our party being there. I get that they are trying to serve as many people as they can the quickest but it put a huge kink in my party's plans.  I walk by Santouka all the time as it's in my area and it has a lineup outside very often. I would suggest everyone try it!"}
{"text":"So far, in Toronto, I've been to Kenzo, Kinton and Ajisen, but this place blows them out of the water.  I had the Shoyo Cha-shu Ramen (Shoyu based ramen with extra pork) with some gyoza. The gyoza was quite delicious, I had it without any dipping sauce because these tasty dumplings had some flavourful juice inside, similar to Taiwanese soup dumplings, but with less juice. Very tasty, but I found the wrapping to be a bit too chewy.  On to the main event: the ramen. It was outstanding. Only at a few ramen places can you really tell that the broth has been made with time and love, and this is one of those places. Shoyu broth is quite salty and savoury, and it was a bit creamy as well. There was a depth of complexity in each spoonful. The ramen noodles were on the thin side, but had a great texture, not too soft, and had bounce. They complemented the pork's texture well. Ah, the pork was so good! Get the Cha-shu version of the ramen if you love pork, because you'll love theirs. The seaweed and bamboo shoots were also delicious. The only thing in the bowl that wasn't complementary was the naruto. I love naruto, but this one was just a little too boiled and chewy, without much flavour.  The restaurant is kept very clean. The service was wonderful, they were very nice people. They entertained our attempts at speaking Japanese with them, too :)  Must try! It's worth the half-hour wait."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and glad it wasn't too busy as I heard there are usually long line ups.  I'm not a huge fan of sitting really close to people, however, the seating is clustered together to maximize space.  So basically you hear your neighbours conversations.  So we ordered a Shio pork jowl ramen, Shoyu Char suy ramen, and the gyoza.  The pork Jowl was basically the highlight as it was perfectly done...and the Shio soup base was probably the best I've had (and I've been to a lot of different ramen places).  Apparently, there is a limited quantity of the pork jowl so you may want to go earlier so they don't run out.  The Shoyu char siu was really tender and tasty as well and the soup base was amazing.  The gyoza was also really good but it didn't stand out as much as the ramen.  With that being said I'd definitely get the gyoza again next time I go.  So besides the cramped surroundings, this place was exceptional and I will be back soon.  One last note is the place isn't cheap...after tip the bill was $50."}
{"text":"Overrated, service could improve  Gave it a try, twice.  Tried the Kara Miso ramen both times.  They serve Japanese portions which is just enough but considering what you pay for not quite worth it.  Is ramen really worth $16? Not really unless there were superior ingredients but this was not the case.  Broth was good and had some flavour (spicy and salt) but lacked any noticeable richness.  the toppings were very cheap, lots of green onions and I think very little slivers of kelp.  I had maybe 2-3 thin slices of pork - nothing phenomenal about the pork either.  At least at Kinton they give you bigger slices.  The boiled egg was def fast food quality, just half of a hard boiled egg which is not a great type of egg to go with ramen.  Noodles were just very standard, they were a little firmer than I'd like and don't taste much different than packaged ramen noodles.  Is it worth the 30 min wait for overpriced mediocre ramen? Only if you like these things.  Service - they can be a bit slow even when there's only three people in the whole restaurant (went at 4).  But what I really am not impressed with is that my dining companion recently injured his leg and was using a cane.  When he went to get up from his seat, he dropped his cane and I caught a few servers laughing - WTF is wrong with people????  There is nothing funny about that, it's just plain ignorant."}
{"text":"Was waiting for places to pop up east of Yonge (as it's now w/i walking distance instead of having to make a trek out to Kinton).  Went on the 14th and waited for about 15-20 mins for dinner.  It's quieter than Kinton, which is a plus esp if going on a date.  The serving size was ok.  I liked the fact that you can choose to reduce the salt content of the broth as well as choosing how cooked you want your noodle to be.  That's def a plus.  The broth I ordered (lower salt) was just right for me, so I can imagine it'd be a lot saltier for regular.  As it's only my first visit, I just chose my default shio ramen (low salt broth, harder noodles)  The bamboo chutes I wish they'd substituted with another choice of veg as it doesn't really go with the dish.  The chutes themselves create an aroma that is (to put it politely) fairly  unpleasant.  Didn't like the fact that there's no egg with the noodles.    Waitresses were polite enough, I don't expect much in terms of service in ramen places"}
{"text":"Amazing service, fantastic food and extremely helpful staff and convenient for families! (high chair and diaper bag holder provided).  Must eat, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Japanese friendly service. Ordered miso noodle. The soup is great. Not greasy, sticky. Warm and refresh. Noodle is average. The pork is super super tender. Even though it is salty, I still enjoyed it.  Came here Ina chilly rainy day. It did warm me up"}
{"text":"Terrible experience! We don't come downtown very often but the last few times we have been, we had noticed a lineup for this restaurant.  We were downtown this past Tuesday at around 2:30 pm, the lineup did not seem too bad so we decided to wait.  We waited about a half hour before being seated.  There were four of us, the table we were given was a table for four but they had two people seated there before us and they were about to give it to a table of three in front us.  However, as the full party of three wasn't there yet, they gave the table to us.  As we sat there, my husband started to feel mildly unwell so did not want to eat.  The three of us ordered but were told that the restaurant's policy was that he could not stay if he didn't order a minimum of around $10.  The waitress suggested that he wait outside for us. Please note that they were not asking us to move to a smaller table, the table was previously occupied by a party of two and was offered to a party of three before us, and our three orders equaled $40 which matched the $10/person limit.  We asked to speak to the manager who would not budge.  They suggested again that he could just wait outside for us, while his seat remains empty?!? Of course, we left but it ruined our day as we didn't have enough time at that point to go to another restaurant."}
{"text":"Heard that this place is doing their soft opening and decided to give it a try coz i'm a huge ramen fan.   we went on a Wednesday night and there was a line up when we got there. We waited around 20mins and got seated. I ordered the Kara Miso Ramen while my bf ordered the Shoyu Ramen. We both like the noodles a bit chewier so we got hard noodles.   Food came relatively quickly, and the soup was absolutely amazing. Definitely the best soup out of all the other ramen joints. The ramen's texture wasn't as good as Kinton or Momofuku's, but it was still decent. I would try their regular noodles instead of hard noodles next time.  I would for sure come back here for more Ramen."}
{"text":"Long wait due to limited seating, but the ramen is above average. The servers are not very patient or service oriented since their goal is to herd you in n out as quickly as possible. It destroys the experience when you can't relax and enjoy your meal. Lastly, the  check came out to $48.80 Canadian dollars. I paid $60 US dollars and the server said the conversion rate was .90 US to 1 Canadian dollar. I told the server that the exchange rate was wrong but he wouldn't listen to me. The exchange rate is $1 US to $1.28 Canadian dollar! Arigato bakaa!"}
{"text":"The pork jowl noodle is delicious except thd soup base is too salty.  Waiting in the line before 6pm is not too long.  But after 6, you have to wait at least half an hour.  I think the ramen is over price with the small portion, but the atmosphere and service are good."}
{"text":"I've been to many ramen places in Toronto and around the GTA and I must say that I have had the most enjoyable experience at Santouka. Their ramen has been top notch and consistent each time I visit. I highly recommend going with the shoyu ramen if you like flavour but don't enjoy a thick broth. If however, you enjoy sipping a thicker broth then try the miso/spicy miso ramen.  There is usually a lineup outside that takes about 15 minutes during dinner hours, so much sure you bring a jacket and some friends!"}
{"text":"Today, we went to try out one of the newly opened ramen restaurants in Toronto. Even though a lot of ramen restaurants opened in Toronto recently, there has not been one that gave me the WOW factor. Therefore, I was very curious of what santouka has to offer and it definitely did its job to surprise me.  We did not have to wait at all and had the opportunity to request to sit beside the bar after seeing these gigantic pots of soup.   I ordered the Tokusen Toroniku Ramen in Shoyu ramen (soy sauce with pork bone soup) which is their signature ramen. The Toroniku Cha-Shu is simmered pork cheek meat, served separately on the side. It was very tender, juicy and very rich in flavour, unlike normal cha-shu in which i often find them to be a little too fatty and dry. I enjoyed it a lot and it gave me a whole new view and definition of ramen.  My boyfriend ordered a combo which came witha Shio Ramen (pork bone soup with salt) and a salmon rice bowl. The Shio soup was certainly not too salty but more creamy and strong in flavour than Shoyu ramen, in which one could taste the richness in Santouka's soup. I would recommend this soup over the Shoyu soup to people who are trying Santouka for the first time.  The Cha-shu that came with the Shio ramen was not as tendered and rich in flavour compared to the Toroniku pork cheek meat. I would say it was in par with other ramen restaurants, but nothing overwhelming or crazy special. In Santouka, you can decide the firmness of your noodles. My boyfriend chose to have the noodles to have served rather hard and I just the normal noodle. Overall, I really like the noodles and they really complement the soup and made a really yummy noodle!  The salmon rice bowl was just typical japanese grilled salmon rice bowl, just like a oingiri.nothing too special again. I probably will not order it next time.  conclusion:  roasted!  I believe that Santouka definitely the best ramen place as of now.  visit http://theroastedacorn.com/2012/12/10/santouka-ramen/ for awesome pictures of the food i mentioned :)"}
{"text":"Was craving simple Ramen and Ramen Santouka definitely hit the spot after being on the road for three weeks. Hidden gem that my nephew turned me on to and ordered the large portion of the shio ramen which I soon learned that the pork bone is simmered for approx. 20 hours.  I counted at least six large stock pots on wok style burners and could tell they turn and burn the seats as this is a small place. Staff was very service oriented and guided me through the menu regarding what I was craving for that nite.  This is a defintie must go to place should you be in Toronto located at the start of \"boys town.\""}
{"text":"I had been dying to give this place a try!  Our plan was to try a few of Yelp's best reviewed places along Dundas which consisted of an early dinner at Santouka, followed by bubble tea at Chatime.  Our group consisted of 4 people today and we arrived at Santouka at about 5:30 hoping and praying there would not be a line so early in the evening.  When we arrived, the restaurant was full and we were the second group in line so I guess we could be considered lucky.  We were seated within 10 minutes of arriving and promptly greeted by our waitress.  She recommended the Shio and Shoyu ramen so we went with 2 of each, one being a Sake combo, which included a small bowl of Salmon on rice.  We also ordered the Gyoza - which weren't very impressive.  They weren't bad, just not great.  Ramen arrived shortly and the presentation was fairly impressive.  Shio ramen was very tasty, not too salty at all even though we went with the regular saltiness.  Shoyu was good as well though being flavoured with soy sauce was a bit saltier than the Shio.  The bowls are definitely not the largest we've ever seen but was quite filling and the broth quite rich.  Overall a very good dining experience and similar to the Ramen we had in Kyoto.  Prices are definitely a bit higher than some of the other places in Toronto but IMHO worth the added cost."}
{"text":"Simply the one of the  best ramen joints in town. I tried their cha siu ramen and the broth was flavourful and good. Cha siu was not fat and very tender. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"By far my favourite Ramen restaurant in Toronto. The broth is rich and complex, each mouthful better than the last. The noodles are chewy but not rubbery. Kinton is like Campbell's soup by comparison."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Ramen restaurants in the city. If there's a line up, just wait. It's really worth it.   The Kara Miso (spicy miso) with the ikura-don combo is awesome, the Miso and shoyu is just perfect.   The gyoza is quite good too. 5 stars in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm typically not a fan of pork, and am that person who doesn't eat the pork that typically comes with ramen because I find it too fatty, but Santouka's pork jowl is something else! It's so tender it melts on your tongue, and as long as you remove the strip of fat, it doesn't leave a fatty aftertaste. I like this with the spicy soup as well. I get the regular size, which looks small but is aways enough to fill me up, their noodles are chewy and well done. The only thing I dislike is that you have to order the soft-boiled egg separately at extra cost.   I've also tried the dipping ramen which I found to be too heavy. It comes with a lot of noodle. And I thought the dipping sauce was too heavy and salty. It wasn't really my thing, but I would still say this place is one of the better ramen places in Toronto."}
{"text":"There's a reason that there is always a line outside. Consistently good! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Tried almost all ramen places in town and this is the best. Shio (salt) soup base is my favorite. Both the regular cha siu (pork belly) and the pork cheek are very tender."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place!  Nice decor, friendly staff, and I find the food very good.  Like others have said, the prices are perhaps the only downside.  Go at off peak times and skip the usual wait!"}
{"text":"This was the last ramen hotspot to try. Hesitant since there are so many good ones around lately. Hesitant because the Vancouver one wasn't very good. Hesitant cuz it's a huge chain from Japan.   Verdict. It can stand with the good ones in TO. It is better than its Vancouver cousin. The broth was rich and tasty.  The egg is disappointing. The price is a little inflated.   Good ramen and worth a try."}
{"text":"TOO salty, but the pork was very well cooked... also noodles weren't fully cooked. kinda disappointed."}
{"text":"Came back again 3 more times and out of the 3 times the broth has been good on the tonkatsu, it was nice and creamy and flavorful. Not the best ramen in the world but one of the best in downtown Toronto.  I especially love the soy based dipping noodles. The dipping noodles are different from the wheat ramen ones served here, they are al dente and are thick egg noodles. Delicious!  I will come back because I love the dipping noodles here,but my wait patience for this place is 20mins and under, ramen should not be a wait forever kind of food!"}
{"text":"Still my no.1 best Japanese ramen in Canada. Although I wish Ippudo could open in Canada!"}
{"text":"Location: On Dundas just east of Yonge-Dundas square. Parking lots are available but pricey. The lot right next to Santouka is $10 flat on weekends. The one behind Santouka is $6 flat on weekends.   Facility: Fairly small, almost always packed, very little waiting room. The corridor fits only about 5 people before it starts feeling cramped, then you'll have to stand outside. Floor to ceiling windows and an open kitchen. Washrooms are nice but TINY. Anyone taller than 5'9 may have to duck.  Food Quality & Price: Meat was soft and tender. I was impressed by the presence of crunchy bamboo shoots and black fungus in my shio ramen. The egg was also very well done, marinated just right with a yolky middle that wasn't cold at all. I personally didn't like that the default noodles were so thin (almost like instand noodles), but they were cooked well enough. The regular/small size is a decent portion and really hit the spot. The only negatives about this ramen is that there is noticeable MSG in the soup base and it is very salty. While I don't doubt that the soup has been simmering for days, I think it would be just fine without MSG. You can ask for LESS salt and LESS fat, but I'm reviewing the default dish that you get without customization.   Service: Good service with a smile from both the ladies and the gents. Fast, and checked in on us just the right amount of times. Didn't feel rushed.  Overall: I would return to Santouka if I was in the area. I do believe that Santouka caters to \"general\" ramen eater who prefer a great deal of flavour and artificiality in their soups. So while it appeals to the masses, I find that it's a bit of a cop out. While the location boasts of Japanese locals seeking out their establishment, I think it's just a matter of decent food at a prime location. They earned a solid 4 stars but could improved by automatically reducing the amount of salt and removing MSG from their soup."}
{"text":"Got the shoyu ramen. Profound pork flavor in the soup. You can see the emulsions in the broth. The noodles were a little too al dente for my taste as I am a soggy noodle man. That being said, I feel that with that flavor of broth, any preparation of noodle would have tasted good. It was also filling and decent value. Clean tables, nice ambiance, quick service. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food - the ramen was great here. It was first time eating ramen and I wasn't disappointed. All the food came out fresh and hot. Some of ordered the large sizes and we were pretty filled up.  Service - its a small hole in the wall and there is a minor lineup to get in. The staff were friendly through the entire process and were able to accommodate an 8 person party for us.  Atmosphere - its a small place and has limited seats. They have displays of their dishes while waiting outside and menus on their windows."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Get that? USED to.  I've frequented this place over 20 times. One of the better ramen places in the city, but that's no excuse for bad service.  2 friends of mine arrived to a pretty empty restaurant. As soon as they sat down, they asked the waitress to be moved to a table for 3. The waitress refused. My friend argued with her saying that we have 3 in our party, and would like to be moved to a table of 3. She refused. They ordered, and I arrive shortly after. I ask a group of 3 girls next to them if I could sit on the 4th seat to join my friends, and they politely agreed. As soon as I sat down, the waitress asked if I wanted to be seated on the other side which was now vacant. I move there. A waiter takes my order, and I tell him I'm just here for a drink, and ordered a beer. He brings my beer and I begin chatting with my friends. He comes back a few minutes later and tells me that there is a minimum order of $9.95 per person, and to order $3 more. I ask if I could just upgrade my draft beer to the larger one, and he says no. I finally decide to order a rice dish for $4.50 to go, which was probably worth about a $3 side dish.   Our bill came up to $43 for the 3 of us. Even without my extra order, we would have been above the $9.95 minimum per person. We left no change for tip. The waitress looks at it and tells us that tip is not included.  We responded: Yes, we know. Because you have horrible service. Her response: oh my god.   OMG is right. Needless to say, the 3 of us will never visit this venue again given all the other options in the city.  Sayonara."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the flavour of the broth in their ramen and would return for it. The tables in the dining room were a little too close together. I also would have liked the opportunity to customize my ramen a bit, but there wasn't an easy way to do that. Service was very fast despite high volume."}
{"text":"probably one of the best of the many (many, many, many) ramen shops in Toronto now. The shio broth is straight up amazing. great depth and flavour. The rare pork cheek meat is quite delicious as well. Considering the wait times right now, some people may find it overrated, but I think anything around the 30-1hr mark is worth it for this place. Really delicious"}
{"text":"Im a big fan of ramen now, i love the location too; makes it feel authentic, the inside isnt so great an appealin to some customers but for me it feels authanticly asian! :D their broath that they use for the ramen was sooo flavourful an it wasnt pricey then i thought, its a good place to chill by yourself when you've got time in your hands."}
{"text":"This place is always busy so theres a few minutes waiting in line but its not bad.  The food is great and i specially like the tsukemen and their gyoza.  The noodles are not soggy and just right and the soup base I usually get is the miso or spicy miso which is rich and tasty. I always stop by here when I am in Toronto for work so I highly recommend it to others."}
{"text":"The ramen here was okay. This shop was actually my first shop for real, authentic ramen made by Japanese people. I've been here twice, and both times i got the Kara Miso Ramen (the ramen here is quite pricey for my student budget haha). It's not spicy, despite the redness of the soup. I was a little disappointed, but not terribly surprised because Japanese foods generally aren't spicy. The soupbase is okay, but it's too fatty/oily for me. However the meat was really good both times i went. The noodles I had the first time (hard) was hard and starchy, like it wasn't cooked thoroughly. THe second time, I asked for soft, which was chewier and a lot better.  Santouka is a nice restaurant, but I prefer Sansotei's prices and soupbase a lot more. However, Santouka's combos are great! (for the prices)"}
{"text":"ZOMG! I never really had a good bowl of ramen until I randomly tried this place beside my hotel. Luckily it was in the middle of the afternoon but it was still fairly full considering it wasn't near the dinner rush.  I had the miso ramen with pork belly and to put it simply it blew my mind as to how good it was. The service was efficient and the staff was well very Japanese. I wish I could take this little restaurant back home with me."}
{"text":"I've tried to come here a few times but each time, there was a long line up that we gave up and went elsewhere. Today, we were here after 2:30pm so we didn't have to wait for seats.  We ordered the Shoyu ramen with extra plate of of pork cheek (jowl) meat. The pork cheek meat is very rare and only 200-300g can be taken from each pig. It has a very rich flavour and it is tender like fatty tuna. It was delicious, melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"First time tried Japanese Ramen and it was delicious! I like their ramen texture is great not overcook or too soft, and the broth is rich but a little bit of greasy. Maybe I have big appetite, the portion is medium, I think I can have 2 bowls at a time. For me a bowl of ramen cost over $10 is a bit of expensive, but it worth the value :)"}
{"text":"awesome! Gotta be one the best ramen in Toronto. Yummy broth. Ramen is just the right firmness. My fav would be the egg. So delicous."}
{"text":"We have passed by so many times seeing lineup outside the store and drove by curiosity, finally tried this restaurant.  The first impression is that while I am a minute later than the other party, seat is not given to us although there are quite a number of empty seats late at night.  The table is given to us once I stepped into the restaurant.  I think this policy of seating should change according to how many tables are empty in the restaurant.  I did not try their set ramen, rather order the standard Santouka Ramen to start as a base comparison.  The noodle is good in texture.  The good side is the order that you can plus or minus according to your choices.   The soup is a bit salty on my less salt and no lard selection.  There are only 3 pieces of quite fatty pork belly and without ordering the set ramen, there is no boiled egg !   If you want less noodle, it is $1 off but watches out - there is only 1 slab of pork belly with the noodle.  With 3 pork belly, a small slice of colorful fish cake, some wood ear mushrooms, bamboo shoots and scallions and a umeboshi (Japanese salt plum) and without boiled egg is a bit over priced and not as good as Sansotei Ramen in both price and quality."}
{"text":"i had high hopes cause i see reviews saying they like it better than kinton but when i ordered my ramen, i only had 2 pieces of meat, and the rest of the bowl was noodles. i mean, the noodles were good and all but where's the veggies and i want more meat! it didn't leave me satisfied but maybe if i had ordered something different, it would've been better. i just ordered the simplest one, maybe it was the shio or miso ramen"}
{"text":"i do not know why it still has min charge for such restaurant in DT. The notice is on back of menu, it is careless to notice that."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service, always busy, closest thing to Japanese Ramen, and I've been to Japan. Portions are smaller than you'd anticipate...smaller than what we got at Sansotei...but tastier. Great location, being close to Yonge and Dundas. Simple menu. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Toronto's ramen craze blew me over to Santouka one Saturday evening. Like other ramen joints, yes, there is a wait and yes, the venue is tiny. Not the tiniest of them all, but still small enough to create massive line ups.   After a 30 min wait, our party of 4 was seated at the bar. Pretty cool - we get to watch them make our food! I ordered the Toroniku Ramen (pork cheek). All the toppings came separately which was good, because then you could heat them with your soup whenever you're ready to munch on those badasses. I'm not sure if they expected us to eat all the toppings, but they gave me a LOT of green onions. I like green onions so that was alright with me! Anyways, the pork cheek was incredibly soft and I recommend this to everyone who comes here. They give you quite a few pieces too, so that's a plus! Everything else was kinda meh. Thumbs down for not having complimentary soft boiled eggs :(  We also got the 10 pc gyoza to share. They were good, but they were tiny. 10 was not enough for the 4 of us.  I must mention - this place is relatively expensive. I believe I walked out with $20 less in my pocket. That's pretty expensive for ramen and a shared plate of gyoza. Well, I had my shot at pork cheek so the experience was satisfactory for me. I don't know if I'll come back because everything else other than the pork cheek was just ok. Maybe when the price is less steep!"}
{"text":"Dropped by after work to pay this place a visit.  It's just a short walk East from Yonge and Dundas.   It was their soft opening, not overly busy, we just walked right in and got seated.  The waitress opened up the menu and said there were only 2 pages available to order at the moment. No problem.  Essentially the first page is the basics, second page more of the basics plus more meat, and some specialty bowls for $15   Not to experiment,  I ordered a Shoyu Ramen,  priced around $10.90  My take, Broth soulless. Empty tasting without complexity. Simple and tap water tasting. (or could this a case of too much lye)    No egg? Found that rather strange.  Bamboo shoots and dried seaweed - nothing out of the ordinary.    Noodles a bit over cooked.  Tasted very much like soft fresh packaged noodle.  Chashu (pork belly) was ok but it was not braised.  Mind you better than Kenzo, and broth not salted to heck like Kinton But there's no competition to Sansotei - you can taste the difference.  And how come all of them are on Dundas?"}
{"text":"#18, Kara Miso Cha Shu, less salt, less lard.  Plus a side order of toroniku (pork cheek).  Best ramen meal ever.  I've tried many places, but Santouka is consistently the best.  Go at 11:30 a.m. or after 2 p.m. and there is little to no wait.  Noodles have the right bite, the broth has the right heat, and the cha shu has a good balance of meat to fat.  The toroniku is a new level or porky goodness.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"I don't know why there is always such a line up. There are many ramen places that are as good or better with no lines. The ramen I had was a miso broth and pork. The broth wasn't anything special and I had much better seasoned pork elsewhere. Good, not great. Maybe I was in a off day and I they watered down the broth and forgot to salt their pork."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Santouka. Me and my family always take the opportunity to enjoy Santouka whenever we travel in the States where Mitsuwa is within range. We've been to Santouka in New Jersey countless of time since 2000. We've been to Chicago and Costa Mesa, California. For this Toronto location, we've been there a few time and today will be my last time. What ticks me? Its your minimum spending of $9.95 per person.   Today, we try to order 2 combos with total approx $32. We were informed with the minimum spending per person and gyoza was suggested by the server which we obliged and was told one order of gyoza is not enough. At that moment, I was really thinking of leaving the table. I felt bad taste because in the past, we spent almost $100+ for ramen in the same restaurant. We were recently in Los Angeles and lined up for Daikakuya ramen for 3 hours, yet we were not  pressured with the minimum consumption and in the end we can't stop eating with total bill of US$100. Today doesn't seem to be a line up at Santouka Toronto and why are they doing this to me! I will not be back at this location, I'd rather drive 8 hours to Mitsuwa in New Jersey for Santouka."}
{"text":"Best ramen, quite possibly one of the best meals of my life. Just incredible. We popped in here after seeing a lineup earlier in our travels that had died down.   We were a little nervous as it is such a hip place, we didn't know what to order. The waitress was lovely, and explained the dishes and what was popular.  We got the dumplings to start, and I ordered the #12 (which was the pork jowl ramen) and my husband got the #15 (which was the spicier version) and added an egg to both.  It was amazing. The flavour was so creamy and rich, and the pork. Oh the pork. I was a little wigged out at the idea of eating jowls but I am so glad I did. The texture was so tender and just worked so well with everything else. I wish I could have another bowl right now.   Please try it. If you are visiting Toronto or live there, please have a bowl for me. Hopefully I'll be back to Toronto soon and that will be the first place I'll go."}
{"text":"Favourite Toronto ramen restaurant! I've tried Sansotei (2nd fav), Kenzo, Kinton, Raijin and  Ajisen; and I still highly recommend this resto even with its long line up! If you're like me and love hot and spicy food, they've got a great spicy ramen dish!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but on the salty side so I suggest that you ask for the broth more bland. The service though in my experience has been terrible. My bf and I arrived, and I went to check in. Our position on the waiting list was confirmed. A family who arrived after us and who didn't check in first, got seated before us. Mistakes are understandable, but when you make a mistake, you gotta make up for it. But this restaurant didn't even so much as apologize for putting others before us. If this is the way I'm treated, then I wouldn't go again regardless of how good the food is."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 20 times and I always get the same thing - Karamiso Ramen with less salt and Pork Jowl with an egg. It's a tad expensive but it's well worth it. Do not cheap out and pass on the egg. It's soft boiled to perfection and tastes like egg ice cream.  Don't even think about going to momofuku, sansotei, kenzo or kinton.  The only other place I will have ramen in Toronto other than Santouka is at home.  Tip: go before 1130 if you want to beat the lunch rush. Also don't order the corn it's literally Del Monte canned corn."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located at the heart of downtown, half a block away from Yonge & Dundas square. Been here a few times, really recommend their ramen/rice combos. It's a great value meal. $15 for a ramen, rice with salmon roe and some pickled radish. I really like their rice - soft but still grainy. The combo remains the same price for lunch and dinner.  Took my Japanese coworker here and he absolutely loved it....exactly how they have it in Japan!!!"}
{"text":"Santouka serves the best ramen in Toronto, in my honest opinion (have eaten at Kenzo, Kinton, Sansotei, and Raijin). However, it's the best with some caveats.  Pros - Best tonkotsu soup: Incredibly rich, porky, and creamy, yet retains an underlying sweet lightness from the \"double soup\" of pork and seafood. Not for the uninitiated who aren't ready for the insanely rich broth. Their shio tonkotsu is the best because it's a great example of the dynamic nature of the \"double soup\" done perfectly without any fishiness. - Good noodles: Not as great as Kinton, but pretty good. Also, they are willing to let you order softer or harder noodles.  - Toppings: The toroniku (pork neck) is melt-in-your-mouth good, but can get overly rich after a few slices. The \"regular\" chashu is also moist and flavourful. The menma are pretty good. - Service: Cheerful  Cons - The tonkotsu soup is not for everyday. It is for right after your annual physical. Also, an oily feeling can linger in your throat for hours after consumption. - Service: The wait. Once I waited 30 minutes for a single spot. The line/wait times could be better managed by a server coming out and taking down names/party numbers, so that they can optimize the turnover times. - Price: The portions look small (but really, you'll be full) and the prices look large. Ramen is supposed to be a working person's everyday meal in Japan and by transporting it from Japan to Canada, they've made it into a meal that the average Canadian working person can't afford on a regular basis. It's really great ramen, but it can also be a $15-$20 bowl of ramen. - Space: Space is at a premium and your elbows will definitely get acquainted with your neighbour's elbows.  Overall: I would go again for the shio tonkotsu alone, but not if I'm mad with hunger because standing in that line alone can drive you crazy hungry."}
{"text":"4/5 for my first ramen experience (of the non-Maruchan variety).   Cute, authentic, Hokkaido style ramen shop right across from the Eton Center. There's usually a short wait, maybe longer on weekend evenings or the lunch/dinner rush. Being so close to the mall, I noticed that it was always kind of crowded. Communal tables and bar seating, depending on the size of your party/preference.  The miso ramen with added soft egg and a side of steamed veggies ($3 for a huge side) makes for a delicious & filling lunch. The broth was good except the bottom got salty which ended up being a good time to mix in the bulk of those steamed veggies. I did ask for less fat and less salt, so it was still manageable. I appreciate that they happily accept such modifications!  The counter seating got me a great view of the chefs preparing fresh noodles and ramen bowls so I recommend that for a more authentic and intimate Japanese style experience.   Overall, it's a cramped space with a minimalist ambiance but the food is of high quality, quite comforting, and modifications are allowed while the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I probably won't have much more to add to the other reviews but what the hey...  My friend and I were able to snag a table the other night just before the dinner rush and after a 20-or-so minute wait--this was my second attempt to eat here so I was pleased. I was also glad to be having something soup-y considering the weather we'd had late last week. On the half-block walk from the car to Santouka, I stepped in a puddle so my feet froze while marinating in street sludge. Soup and noodles to the rescue!  The place was tiny and while some people like to dawdle after their meals, I often feel rushed when I see hordes of people lined up at the door and try to eat and just get the eff out. I can't help it..and besides, ramen places aren't meant for people to sit around and kill hours on end.    I never tried Santouka when I was in Japan but I have had it in LA and theirs was DAMN GOOD. They also came in different sizes, whereas the location in Toronto offers only the one size which looked small when it arrived but was actually enough, probably because of the richness of the broth. We both ordered the basic miso ramen and gyoza and a couple of pops (sodas) which come in the old-school bottles--so cute! The ramen bowls are served in individual lacquer trays, which has nothing to do with anything, but I liked it anyway. The soup has that rich density that seems to accompany broths that have been boiling away forever, and you know it's got to be pretty fatty, but that's what makes it so guuuhhhhd~ There were two small pieces of chashu, a swirly odeng, green onion, black mushrooms (or was that seaweed?), and those pickled thingies (I forget what they're called). I didn't realize it doesn't come with the egg but just as well since I don't like it when the yolks are half-runny, even though that's how they're supposed to be. The noodles were springy which was a good sign. There's no question that this chain knows what they're doing. I didn't find anything too unique about the gyoza but I find that's usually the case, just that gyoza and ramen go hand in hand.   Service is friendly and cheery, and things move along quickly enough. I noticed a wide age range of Japanese people eating at Santouka the night I was there, which is always a good sign.   I had Kenzo at the original location last week and it's not what it used to be, from what I understand. Sadly, I don't really have high expectations of ramen in Toronto but am willing to keep trying the different places that seem to be popping up everywhere. So far I'd say Santouka is one of the better places here, hence the 4* rating, but I think we still have a way to go."}
{"text":"The best in Toronto to date ... Better than their Chicago outlet.  But where are the gyoza dumplings?   Ramen, gyoza and a cold beer is the combinaiton I miss from Japan ... GREAT STUFF !!!!"}
{"text":"Perfect weather to have a nice hot bowl of ramen! Been here a few times but it's been awhile so same great service and quality of ramen! Slurp!!"}
{"text":"One star for the worse services I experienced in 2018. The Japanese waitress is quite rude, act in a way that she's not willing to serve. We still pay 15% tips but will not go back again.  Seriously there're so many good ramen place closed by why on earth I'm paying to get horrible services + bad experience?"}
{"text":"I have always been impressed with my ramen here, and the line of people that are always out the door seem to agree. I go here whenever I am in the dundas area and in the mood for noodles."}
{"text":"My favorite ramen spot in Toronto! The broth is creamy and thick, pork is tender and noodle has the right amount of chewiness. My go to is shoyu broth because I like my broth thick. This is a must go if you are a ramen lover!"}
{"text":"I just got off the plane and was craving some ramen. After I saw a bunch of pictures of this place, I decided to come here straight from the airport.  The place was empty at 2:30pm on a tuesday.   I ordered the Shio ramen. The broth was a little oily and salty for my liking, but very flavourful. The noodles were really good, probably the best of all. The size was pretty small for the extra $2 I had to pay. But I was full and happy in the end so nothing to complain about. If you are a guy though you probably will still be hungry after one bowl.  I can't pick a favourite between sansotei and this place. Try it for yourself."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and I have been disappointed both times. The first time I ordered the shoya ramen and it was way too salty. It lacked complexity in flavor.   The second time, I went and ordered a miso ramen. Remembering the saltiness last time, I requested it to be half-salted (yes, you can customize the level of salt!) It was better, but still too salty. I don't know what to do now. Should I ask for no salt at all?  With the amount of ramen places popping up around this neighborhood (and there have been a lot recently!) this place is alright but there are better options out there.   Note to people standing in line: get there before noon if you're there for lunch, and before 5 if you're there for dinner! I don't think it's worth it to stand in line, not for a bowl of noodles."}
{"text":"Has gone downhill... Noodles were too soft and my egg was well done. They refused to replace my egg stating that they don't guarantee it... Wow so u don't stand behind the quality of ur food? Very expensive too!"}
{"text":"THIS is Japanese ramen I love! !   So happy that they are finally opened in Toronto. I would recommend to choose combination which comes with ramen and rice donburi. There is ikura, salmon, and simmer pork donburi to choose but my favourite is Ikura with shio!  Love this place because you can choose to reduce salt, lard or even choose soft or firm  noodle depending on what we wish.  It may end up a bit pricey as my husband said, but I think it was worth it.  Can't wait to go back and try another noodle."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Santouka a few times now and I can say it is not my favorite ramen place. I enjoyed Sansotei much more and found the prices more reasonable.   The broth and meat is a bit too fatty for their typical ramen selection. The meal can also get quite expensive compared to most ramen places when you go for their special combos or meat selections.   By no means is Santoka a bad restaurant, but compared to its very close competitor I would not go here unless Sansotei was busy."}
{"text":"I like this place, I've been to many ramen places in the city and this is one of the top 5.   It is really really small, and very popular, so you may have to wait awhile to get a seat during peak hours (even off hours too I've had to wait a few times). But it is well worth it.  They have the usual ramen fare, but the quality of everything is what sets this place apart!"}
{"text":"My number one go to ramen place. I've had kinton, sansotei and even kenzo, but none of them compares. I love their spicy miso ramen and the side dishes. They did increase their prices recently but it's still worth it for me. Hopefully they keep their consistency in flavour"}
{"text":"Red Miso Ramen and Pork on Rice  Very clean broth with some of the best char siu I've had in Toronto so far! Definitely going to return to try the other menu options"}
{"text":"Lunch at Santouka gets pretty busy. We arrived at 11:45am and after we arrive there was a line up, the lunch rush. We ordered the spicy miso ramen with side gyoza and shio ramen with a side of pork jowl. The spicy miso ramen has a very balanced flavour and kick of spice. Shio broth was very rich but delicious. There was no choice of thin or thick noodles but the noodles were cooked perfectly! The char siu was very good shio came with two pieces and i wished i had more. Gyoza was okay, not enough filling. The pork jowl melted in my mouth goodness! when you get the jowl make sure you take one with negi and dip it in your broth to make it warm before you eat it! Overall, very good ramen, their prices are a dollar more than other places, but worth the experience."}
{"text":"There are so many different ramen shops in Toronto, especially in the downtown core, and this one didn't make much of a mark for me. The restaurant area was crowded (didn't have anywhere to put my bag and jacket) because the seating area is too close to each other for my liking. However, the staff was very friendly.  We ordered the shiyo and shoyu ramen. The broth was pretty good, very refreshing. The best part was that the small bowls (yes, I said the bowls are small) were full of noodles. But I still think that it's a bit on the pricy side with the size of your order. Also there was nothing special about the bowls. It was basically just your average ramen with noodles, some meat and broth. There wasn't even an egg included. I like eggs with my ramen - personal preference, I know."}
{"text":"The King of Ramen I have been to all to top Ramen in Toronto. Most of them are great but there only one  that could be the King. A bit pricey . But its the real deal. See the picture I posted $15.00"}
{"text":"Nice decor...a bit like an IKEA. The menu here is has a wider selection than most ramen places I've tried.   I ordered the shoyu ramen with extra pork. The pork was dry and got stuck in my teeth. I found the noodles to be thick and egg-y which was filling. Soup was OK. I prefer Sansotei Ramen on Dundas because it's lighter."}
{"text":"I love this place! I loved it when I tried it in Vancouver several years ago and was hooping that it would come here I was so excited to hear that they were opening a location in Toronto. The Shio ramen is my favorite!  The broth is the best I have ever had.  I'm getting hungry thinking about it...  I've been fortunate in that I've never had to line up to eat here or at their Vancouver location. Maybe that's why I rated them on the higher side compared to others? I don't like waiting for anything and a long wait would definitely changed my opinion about a place. Tip to avoid the wait: go during \"off-peak\" times, like a late lunch/early dinner and that goes for any place that normally has line ups."}
{"text":"\"Santouka has the best ramen in Toronto\". Can't agree more! This is probably the only place I don't mind lining up for. Seriously great broth and good portion of food."}
{"text":"I've been here before and enjoyed the ramen here.  But things have changed for the worst since the last time I was here.  The ramen was ok but what was really bad was the service.  I think I've got better service at Coffee Time with incompetent staff who mixed up coffee and tea.  I should have got the hint when I was there at prime dinner time and it was practically empty when places like Sansotei and other Ramen joints were packed and lined up out the door.  I quickly realized why.  The waitresses were not friendly.  They started off be telling us they have a $10 per person minimum.  That is okay we ordered a $19 combo to share plus a dessert (a slice of cheesecake for $4) and was considering to try out their drink.  I wasn't that hungry at the time I just wanted to try their dessert.  The waitress said that does not count towards the $10 minimum per person as in if someone in your group ordered a $20 meal the other people still have to order $10 minimum.  I've never heard of that before!  That is completely retarded, the restaurant was empty, I was ready to walk out but my husband really enjoyed this place and it was our date night so I didn't want to ruin the mood.  So we were forced to order another ramen that I barely touched.  I can't say much about the ramen but the green tea cheesecake was nothing special.  My husband is a ramen fanatic and said the quality has gone way down.  Next time we want ramen we won't be coming back here ever and we will be telling all our friends the shitty service.  I'll take Sansotei over this anytime even if I have to line up outside in dead winter, in fact I'll even take Kenzo Ramen over this sorry place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Thought I should go there at least twice before putting a review down for this place, since it is so hyped up.   For starters, the first time I came here I ordered the Miso Ramen... really really salty. WAY too salty. I drank close to a litre of water shortly after my meal.   The second time I went I ordered the Kara Miso Ramen and got FOOD POISONING. Umm, I would say the ramen I had did not justify the food poisoning. Again, overly salty. Plus, the Kara Miso Ramen tastes exactly the same as their Miso Ramen."}
{"text":"Shio ramen was very tasty. At $12, I wish the pork and noodle portion would have been bigger, but they have a upsize charge of $1 for large. Once you order however, it is too late to upsize as they already start cooking your noodles and ladle broth into the bowl.   Seating along the bar was nice, but hot! You get a nice view of the open concept kitchen watching the chefs go to work!  The broth was tasty, noodles were nice and chewy. A bit of expensive, however this is a nice treat once in a while."}
{"text":"Great Great Great.  The best one in town!!!  I tried the other one which is the competitor, also has good review,  but I personally think this one is no wonder the bEST.    Pricey for just a bowl of noodle.  But I can not resist the taste of it. Will go back often."}
{"text":"Food: 9/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Service: 10/10 Overall experience: 9/10  Definitely worth a try if you are in the area. Although it is a small restaurant, the wait was fairly quick and we never felt like we were being rushed throughout the service.   I tried a combo, in which you receive a ramen and a rice bowl. I opted for the Kara Miso ramen (spicy) with the salmon roe rice. The ramen was delectable. The broth had just enough of a kick, the noodles were firm and it had plenty \"topping\" to mix it up. The restaurant has an option for you to lower the amount of lard (yikes) and salt in your ramen, which I did, and even so, it had that \"so bad for you but it's so good\" taste.  The service was also great. The waitress was friendly, patient, and even let us have a bottle of their sparkling sake early (it was only supposed to be for the week of Valentine's Day, but we happened to be there a day before). The Mio sake was delicious, so also is something I would recommend.  Bottom line: worth the hype."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Japanese ramen restaurant in Toronto. Their soup base is very strong, it's much better than other restaurants! I think Santouka is top 1 Japanese ramen in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great ramen. I had the Shio ramen which was fantastic. We also had the Toroniko for a starter, which is the specialty at this place and man is it ever. Service is decent and prices are reasonably. All around great place. Oh and it's a small place with quick service."}
{"text":"Worth to try once,  but not twice!  Have been there the day before ytd, tried their KARA MISO RAMEN COMBO with a blended pork rice. Ramen quality & texture are not a good one,  feel like eating instant noodle, compare with the noodle from Kyouka,  i think hokkaido's one is too hard with no texture. For the soup didn't have enough taste but only spicy taste,  soup density are lower than what I had in Sansotei and Kinton. For the soup,  its not reached my standard. Their chasiu are quite good anyway,  the portion of meat & fat are nice,  but less taste enough. Dishes served so quick even thy have a lot of customers, this is good. Size of ramen is quite small and expensive at this price comparing to the other brands. I like their blended pork rice bowl which including blended pork, green onion and importantly some source onto the rice so its has nice taste. Atmosphere there really Japanese like,  but specific staff serving the bill and while i left the shop without any greetings, was different from any shops i tried in downtown area..."}
{"text":"All I can say is best ramen ever. Got a good sized menu, love that you can customize by portion size, saltiness, and noodle firmness. Just make sure you go early or later to beat the line up."}
{"text":"Amazing.  BF and I tried this place for \"brunch\" on Sunday afternoon maybe around noon, and we were surprised to see a line up of maybe 15 people before us. He was discouraged and suggested we go elsewhere because the line would take an hour. A friendly patron (and I assume a regular) in front of us said it would move fast. The same person also told us that the pork jowl was the best item on the menu- and she was right on both fronts.  The service was SUPER fast and efficient (duh-Japanese). The server took our orders within 2 mins of us sitting down. Food appeared maybe 5 minutes later. And we paid and left before 1pm.   Hokkaido ramen's broths are quite great- I believe that all of the ramen comes in 4 broth choices. I got the miso pork jowl which I quite liked, but it got a little too salty near the end. The pork jowl only has limited quantity per day apparently- and it's the best pork I've had in a while. I would say the noodles are fairly standard- nothing amazing and I've had better.   COME HERE and GET THE PORK JOWL. PLEASE!!"}
{"text":"In addition to the raving reviews of Santouka, lining up out in the cold for an hour certainly will raise anybody's expectations for apparently the best ramen shop in Toronto.   Let me start with the good stuff: 1. Pork cheeks are very tender (Toroniku) - If I come again, that would be the only thing I'd order.   To summarize the rest of my experience: 1. I really do not  understand the \"No Reservation\" rule. The waitress wouldn't seat us until everyone in our party was present. When our friend arrived, I advised the waitress asap, and she snapped \"Yes I know that\"  - 0/5 for Service.   2. I ordered the spicy ramen and asked for less salt and less lard (that was offered as an option) and it arrived at our table fairly quickly. Here's a summary of the ramen: a. Under-cooked noodles - It tasted like packaged noodles, I absolutely agree with Edwin's review b. The soup had no particular taste, and was still salty with a layer of oil floating on top.  c. Bamboo shoots were flavourless and the egg on the side was probably cooked the day before. I thought the yolk was served semi-raw?  d. The shrimp tofu salad was just awful. Don't waste your money on this. The tofu tasted like it was just drained from the pre-packaged brands sold in grocery stores.  - 2/5 for Food Quality  Overall, what a disappointment. I would never wait this long for ramen again.   This place is over-rated - $16.80 for the ramen and fish roe on rice combo - I'd spend this money on a good piece of steak instead."}
{"text":"Perfect ramen, perfect soup!!!!! Very good clean area, fast services. This is the BEST Japanese noodles  in GTA Toronto. Should go and try.... But please go earlier before 6pm, or, after 9pm... Otherwise need to long line up"}
{"text":"Best ramen I have had outside of Japan.  Definitely best I had of about the 8 I have tried in Toronto.  Heavy fatty broth does sit in your gut after...but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Have been a regular here for 1 year and impresses every time!! Soups very rich in flavour and not overly salty. Usually get the shio ramen with consistent quality every time. Excellent service, have tried other dishes but ramen is best item on the menu.  The soy sauce broth is also excellent - only complaint is that the meat can be very fatty at times. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The rich pork broth in Janapeno ramen is very tasty. And it's not spicy."}
{"text":"One of the best ramens I've had. Definitely come back again! If you know the flavour of authentic Japanese ramen, you'll know Santouka makes ramen very close to the one you can have in Japan. Broth is virtually the same I found. If you are not familiar with authentic one, you'll find it still delish! But! I will avoid waiting in line for more than an hour again by coming super early or late to have a bowl of goodness. Compared to Kinton ramen i tried last time, this is heaven! :P"}
{"text":"Idk if I was caught up in the moment of being in the snow for the first time and have hot ramen, but i had a great experience here. The ramen was delicious."}
{"text":"My japanese hairdresser told me this is as authentic as it gets when it comes to ramen in Toronto - and I'm so glad I took him up on his suggestion.  \"Just like Toyko,\" he raved.  I do believe that this is as good as it gets in terms of ramen in Toronto.  The soup was wonderfully rich (yes fatty) and sweet, the noodles were perfectly al dente, the gyoza are hand made with the thinnest skin I've ever had this side of the ocean.    DO order a side of jowl meat (or get the ramen that comes with it) DO go during off times or you'll wait in line chatting with strangers (not such a bad thing, but not fun if you're hungry and the wait time is over 40 minutes). DO eat the fat on your meat - it is wonderful (your diet can start tomorrow). DO order the combo with rice.  I had the salmon on rice.  The rice was cooked perfectly.  The only disappointment I had was with my side of egg.  Although the flavour was there, the yolk was solidly cooked (borderline dry) and not the soft yolky egg I'm accustomed to getting with ramen.  Was it an off day, or do they do things differently here? I see some yolky pictures in the gallery, so I'm guessing they served something that wasn't done properly.  Minus one star for that...but everything else was great!  BTW, I've been to Kinton, Momofoku, Ajisen, Kenzo, etc.,...and this one takes the prize thus far!"}
{"text":"Came here for my second ramen experience as it was recommend by a good friend and has good Yelp reviews. There's also always a line to get in.   I may just be meh on ramen in general but this place did not blow me alway. Found there was not a lot to choose from and service was very poor. Our ramen did come quick and was a perfect temperature. The pork in it was indeed delicious.   The Good: 1. Quick. The food comes out quick. 2. Pork. The pork in the ramen was delicious.   The Bad: 1. Line. Be prepared to wait while you smell ramen being cooked.  2. Service. They didn't fill up our water at all. Which is terrible considering how salty ramen is.  3. Bland. I found most of the food quite bland.   We tried the miso ramen and the shio ramen. We added corn to both.   Tip: GO EARLY and stick to the regular or small sizes. Ramen is salty enough!"}
{"text":"Urgh overpriced. Too busy there, too tourist-trappy, server too busy, and each person has to spend at least $10 or $12 or i forgot, so that's annoying cuz we wanted to buy a meal combo and share it but we couldnt cuz of the price minimum per person. Ramen is pretty good but yea overpriced in my opinion, Kenzo has better value ramen down the street"}
{"text":"Some of the best ramen I've had to date. I've never had an authentic bowl from Japan, but if I were to imagine it I would hope it's something like this. Even though its a chain restaurant and chains typically have a 'bad rep' - it was so delicious. Perfectly flavored and portioned. Definitely hit the spot. I only got a bowl of ramen, no drink or appetizer, and I left feeling the need for a nice post-food baby belly rub!  MISO RAMEN --  The pork belly was so perfect! Each piece was the perfect meat:fat ratio. It had a great, kind of salty flavor that wasn't overpowering with the miso soup base. The noodles were well made & cooked. Not too chewy or too soft - a really good ramen. Don't be fooled by the bowl. It may look small, but it is extremely filling. Though small in width, the bowl is deep. It's like I couldn't even find the bottom. A little bit of seaweed, little bit of scallion, a piece of naruto - bomb!   Only downside of this place is the size. It's good so it seems like it's always packed, especially during peak hours. We went around 4:00 and there was a decent wait. They got people in and out as fast as they could though so we waiting ~30-45 minutes? The waiting area is kind of non-existent so you stand in the entrance until you're seating. It's on a first come first serve basis, so don't step out of line. If it's winter time like when I went, bless your souls of you have to stand outside.   In my opinion the ramen was decently priced for the quality. I would definitely come back again if I'm ever back in Toronto and recommend it to others looking for a nice, hot, delicious bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"I love ramen. It's hearty, it's salty, it's the classic instant noodles I ate as a child, and it gives you that cozy feeling. Santouka however takes the \"cozy\" factor to the next level.  I had 5 people in my group. First of all, they refused to seat us cause only 4 of the 5 were present. Okay fine, understood.. But when your restaurant is empty? Really?!    Secondly all their tables are constructed for EVEN numbers of guests. If you are a group on odd number then prepared to get close and personal. When we finally got seated, even though there was an available table next to us that could transform our seating from a 4 to a 6 seater, we were told \"not allowed\". They didn't even allow us to add an extra chair at the end to comfortably accommodate the total 5. They claimed they don't have extra chairs! Ludicrous. So my friends and I, with 3 on one side, and 2 on the other \"cozily\" ate our ramen, knocking out elbows and jabbing each other.   As for the ramen, it was just a little bit... \"Too gourmet\" for me. I've been to other ramen restaurants, and I'm sort of a die hard fan to a specific ramen chain, won't say where but this ramen I had at santouka was just alright. I don't like how you can't customize the noodles the broth or the meat to your liking. I also got the Kara miso ramen expecting to get kicked in the ass with flavour. And I did, but wait maybe that was my friend who was kicking me because we had no space. Heh.   The service here was mediocre, it didn't have that homely feel of a ramen restaurant where they yell at you when you come in and leave.   Won't be cheating on my regular ramen place for Santouka any time soon :( boohoo."}
{"text":"4.5. After being in a rush two nights before and not having the time to brace the line, I found myself back in the area and decided that the ramen craving was too strong and just needed to be satisfied. Popped in shortly after noon and only had to wait for about five minutes. After a short perusal through the menu, I found myself staring down a bowl of Toroniku Shoyu Ramen.   So, ramen is nothing but noodles and some salty soup, right? Right! Except... that this is an immensely satisfying bowl of noodles and salty soup which makes all the wrongs in your world disappear for fifteen minutes, while you think about nothing but the umami in your mouth.  Ok. So. Toroniku Shoyu Ramen. What's the big deal? At first glance, this doesn't seem all that appetizing. It's literally a bowl of soup with some noodles, and a plate of sliced pork meat with some green onions, a little fish cake and a little piece of seaweed. But then grab some of that pork, dunk it in the ramen and take a bite. Oooh man. Have you ever had your mom make you a super dry pork chop that's ten minutes over cooked? Think the exact opposite. The jowl (pork cheek) has a velvety texture, which, coupled with the soup, begs for another bite. The ramen, covered in the broth, is chewy, savoury, and layered in flavours. Even the most unrefined palettes (read: mine) can appreciate the many hours that goes into crafting the soup.  In addition, we had ordered a plate of gyoza. They came five to an order and tasted swell enough, but nothing to really rave about. In my opinion, this place is all about the ramen (although I did have a ramen + rice bowl + beer here once and it was really tasty - albeit it resulted in a little too much food for me).  So, if you're lucky, you won't have to wait. Otherwise, the wait, in my opinion, is worth it."}
{"text":"Been here twice, it is quite comparable to Kinton, Sansotei, and Kenzo. Prices here are higher ($13 per bowl) but service is fast, efficient, and nice. There is a line up but tends to move quite quickly. Ramen is alright but does not really live up to any  high expectations."}
{"text":"Best Ramen I've had so far in Toronto!  Quick service, good prices and solid portion sizes.  Def better then the pricier Momofuku, waiting to compare against Sansotei (when I dont have to wait outside).  Will def return."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, there were long lineups outside, and I remember the ramen being very unique, being the only Japanese owned chain operating in Toronto.  My favourite is the pork jowl ramen, with bamboo shoots served on a plate with the noodles in a separate bowl.  My favourite part is biting into the marbled pork which is both springy and moist and flavourful.  At $16 it's a bit pricey, but it's definitely the way to go as the regular char siu is only on par with the competition.  The broth is one of the most flavourful in the city, besting Sansotei for complexity as well as meatiness in the flavour.  I find that it's a bit too salty making it hard to enjoy if you're a broth fan (and you should be if you're eating ramen that doesn't come out of a foil packet).  I have some reservations to giving it 5 stars though, as it's not the best value in the city, and the staff seems to be overworked and undertrained."}
{"text":"The best ramen I have ever had!  The line up for this place is so annoying. We went there on a rainy day (who doesn't crave ramen on a cold day) and had to stand in this tiny space till a table become available. The seating is very cramped and you can hear everyones conversation and it can get very loud. The food however makes up for all this, My husband and I both had the Miso Ramen and some Gyoza and it was delicious. The ramen broth was so good that I scraped the bottom of my bowl to finish it. i have been to other ramen places and this one is by far the best.  I would love to go often but the line up is a huge buzz kill."}
{"text":"Their price is higher than similar ramen place. Taste is average. For some kind of noodle there is no egg on it which I think it's a must have thing. Egg doesn't cost too much for the restaurant but without it, they will lose many customers."}
{"text":"I really almost was able to be back in Japan for an hour or so, eating very delicious, perfectly cooked gyoza, slowly dipping the delicious dumplings into the sauce.  A Sapporo was drunk as well.  Then the regular, straight up miso ramen.  Heaven :).  The pork - delicious.  The ramen & miso - exquisite.  Well worth my subway trip there.  Thank you sooooo much for a delicious meal & a memory."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday evening with a group of 4. Luckily, on of us was there early and willing to wait for an hour and a half while the rest of us arrived at 6:30. Why? Who knows... but he's the BESTEST!!! There was a long line up all night and there's good reason for it.  Santouka is a small space with a huge fan base and their food is very tasty. Hell had also frozen over so people needed hot comfort food.  We had: - Miso Ramen. I tried the soup base it was a little too salty for me. - Shoyu Ramen. I tried the soup base and it was the saltiest of the 3. - Toroniku Shio Ramen (my order) Great creamy soup base not overly salty maybe because the pork was placed on a side dish. The pork cheeks were Amazing! Crazy tender and melt on your mouth good. - Gyoza, typical but good. - Girlled Salmon on rice, had great flavour but it's a really small bowl.  Service was very fast but also accommodating and friendly. The bill was under $90 including tax and tip, it was decent but pricey for a ramen meal. Definitely coming back, but sticking to the Shio soup base."}
{"text":"Delicious! Tried the shio and the spicy miso ramen. We asked for low salt in the shio ramen(which already has less salt), it came out perfect. I really enjoyed the level of spiciness in the spicy miso ramen. We went with their standard pork which was tender, flavourful and good size pieces. Decor is warm and cozy. We arrived before 6pm on a Saturday and got a seat quick, but by 6:30 people were waiting in a sizeable line. The staff were friendly and attentive and helped with menu suggestions without coming across as \"overselling\".  Next time I'll try adding an egg, they looked good. Regular size bowl was a satisfying portion that left me wanting just a little bit more."}
{"text":"Today's rainy weather was perfect for a warm comforting bowl of ramen! First time trying Santouka, and despite coming early at 5pm, there was already a line waiting. Thankfully, we got seated very quickly within 10 minutes.  Three of us ordered the shio ramen, while one ordered the spicy miso ramen. I also got a smaller portion of noodles (for $1 less), with an egg on the side. The four of us chose to share a side of toroniku (their famous pork jowl cheek meat).  Although the waitress warned me that my shio ramen would be a very small portion, it was, funnily enough, more or less the same size as the others. Instead, the main noticeable difference was that it had one less piece of char siu... I winded up with only one piece rather than two. My egg was also quite disappointing; instead of being runny, it was almost fully cooked. Definitely not worth the additional $1.80 charge.  Those complaints aside, I was actually quite pleased by the food. The toroniku was very tender and lean, and was an evident contrast to the fatty char siu in the bowl. The shio broth was also delicious! It was super creamy, and the perfect amount of smooth, salty, and sweet.   Although not as strong in porky flavour as the broth from Ichiran, it was very light and gentle. I drank all the broth, and wasn't too thirsty even at the end of it! The spicy miso ramen is a bit more complex and rich in flavour, and fairly spicy, but still very fragrant. A very pleasant meal!"}
{"text":"Simply my favorite ramen resto in Toronto, period.  Go here and get the extra noodles (only $1.00 more).   The only place better is the same named ramen resto in Vancouver, near identical menu."}
{"text":"This is one of the best ramen places in town! I went with my friend who does not like ramen due to having bad experiences with it at other places. She ended up loving it here! We tried two different broths and they were both very rich and flavourful. The miso broth was a bit salty to my taste. There is an ingredient (i think it's mushrooms?) that was a bit hard to chew and the next time I would ask to bring it on the side. The noodles are cooked to perfection (not soggy and overcooked and not undercooked and bouncy either). The egg is amazing here (it is the type with the honey-textured yolk and brown coloured on the outside) so make sure you order it with your bowl! They charge extra for the egg, around $1.5 for a whole egg. Totally worth it in my opinion.  I have been to this place 3 times so far and will definitely go back again this Winter."}
{"text":"I still love this place, and it sucks, because I live across the street and I'm turning into a noodle addict.   On their own, the delicious noodles fill you up when you eat them, but like most CHO dishes, the feeling of being satiated doesn't last for too long. What I've discovered though, is that for an extra $2, you can get double meat with your order, and that little bit goes a long way.   Yum, yum, yum. Now I get to enjoy my noodles, and feel good too!"}
{"text":"A 4 at the very least. Has to be on par with the best the city has to offer, wherever that is. I have sampled a lot in Toronto as I was seeking the same experience I had in Tokyo. Still haven't found it though.  The Toroniku which seems to be their bread and butter definitely delivered. Excellent slices of pork but I found that it did not merit a 50% markup to their regular ramen offerings, which essentially is the same bowl with a different cut of pork. It still  had the exact same flavor.   Reviews mention menu a bit over priced which I agree with to some extent. Here's how the prices are: Toroniku ramen - 15+ (really 16) Other ramen which isnt Toroniku - 10+ (really 11) Other ramen with side combo - 15+ Sides - 5ish  The broth did get quite salty halfway but other than that, not much to complain about really. Definitely worth a try. By the way, just like any other decent ramen place, dining area is small and there's always a line (and i'm talking 3pm on a sunday)"}
{"text":"Went to eat, front door didn't work and said last call at 9, arrived just before 9 to get yelled at by a short Asian woman"}
{"text":"In terms of the ramen noodles, Santouka is not the best but their soft boiled egg, toppings and soup flavor is yummy and very authentic. The best bang for your buck is the combo and I would highly recommend the combo with the salmon roe on rice."}
{"text":"I have no idea about the background of this place but apparently according to the friends I went with its super popular and one of the best places for Ramen.   First time trying specifically Ramen and in all honesty the only reason I waited in line outside for over half an hour was because:   1) it was not that cold 2) I was outvoted 3 to 1 to eat here   So after that wait where most of it was spent watching people inside eat we were seated and served pretty quick. This place is crammed, its like school cafeteria seating where the dining experience does not matter. Kind of place where you are expected to eat and get the f*k out so the next in line can be seated.   The menu - mainly pork dishes, so for myself off the bat it did not seem that great with not much description given to the menu items or the types of soup.  I went with a combo dish which included some rice and the spiciest Ramen dish for $16. Yes it tasted great but not worth the wait outside.  Would only ever come here again if there was absolutely no line."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend a couple of weeks ago, after having read the reviews on Yelp.  I have to say that I was underwhelmed with my experience there.  There was a long lineup to get it, and they have a very small entrance way, so it meant waiting at the drafty door for about 45 minutes before getting a table (this was on a Tuesday night).  I found the menu to be a bit confusing to understand, and the waitress had a difficult time clarifying the menu for us.  After placing our order, and double checking that we had placed it correctly, the wrong order still arrived.  We ate our food anyway, and still enjoyed it.  The ramen was quite heavy and salty, and I've had better ramen at other restaurants in Toronto before.  We also ordered a drink that was fizzy, peach-flavoured, and had jello chunks in it.  This was probably the best thing that I had that evening.  I don't think I will be going back thought."}
{"text":"Love santouka's ramen! I've tried the shio, shoyu and spicy ramens and my favourite is their shio! The soup base is very creamy and rich. The ramen is presented very nicely with all its ingredients poking out of the broth and it is really colourful!   I always like to add a marinated egg on the side and add it into the broth. They also give you the option to choose regular or large sized ramen and also have set meals with a small rice dish on the side.   The only negative thing about the food is that I feel like their ramen got a little soggier as the years passed. I normally prefer a firmer noodle.  The restaurant seats around 30-40 people and I don't recommend going around busy meal times as there's sometimes a wait out the door. Try going just after lunch or for an early dinner to get seated faster!  It's also a great place to eat a quick meal by yourself as you can sit on the counter (which faces the kitchen) and watch them cook the ramen."}
{"text":"Awesome ramen. No complaints. Gyoza was dope. All their ramen is really good. Noodles are nice and firm, and the broth is not too salty or fatty. Great!"}
{"text":"I would say it's comparable to Kinton, but just not as great.  The seating is a bit smaller than Kinton, however we didn't have to wait in line on a winter weekday night.  The broth was ok, not overly salty but also not too flavourable.  The ramen noodle was good, but nothing great.  The gyro were a good size and was really juicy on the inside.  Overall a cute place for ramen, but I wasn't blown away by it."}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised why this place is still rated so highly. It's not bad at all, but with all the other ramen places I just don't find anything special about this place. Noodles were a bit thinner than my liking, and just a bit too soft. I normally order the Kara miso and there is nothing special about the broth. The meat is also easily forgotten since it was such a small piece. I do remember I used to like their ramen more, did the quality go down? This is one of the more pricey ramen places but has the smallest portions. I do like how their menu offers more variety than just ramen, with dessert and rice. Still, there's a bunch of other ramen places I can go to instead of this one."}
{"text":"I came here because it seemed really popular and I wanted to see if it lived up to the hype. We got there at around 520pm, and though we didn't have to wait to be seated, it was still pretty crowded. Another 20 minutes later and we would have had to wait in a decent line.   I got the kara miso and my boyfriend got the regular miso Ramen. The Kara miso wasn't bad. The noodles were cooked nicely and the broth was okay. It wasn't the worst Ramen I've had but it wasn't the best either. Nothing that would explain the huge line of people trying to come in, though. The chasu in mine was probably my least favorite. It didn't really add anything to the meal, and was kind of tough.   My bf and I had just come from NY, where we got Totto Ramen (!!AMAZING!!!) so maybe my ramen standards are too high now. But either way, this ramen spot isn't one I'd hurry to tell my friends about."}
{"text":"Think I found my new favourite ramen place. I had the shoyu ramen and the ikura bowl combo. For about $20, it is on the expensive side but I think for the amount of food and ikura given it was fairly priced for toronto standards.  The broth was delicious. The bamboo shoots which are normally a little lack luster at other places were so flavorful (wish I got an extra order of just those). My only complaint would be I though the pork was sliced a little bit thickly for my liking, but delicious none the less. I also liked the doneness of the noodles - just a bit of bite and not too soft.  The ikura bowl I would order again just on its own. The salty and fishy eggs go perfectly with the fresh rice. Mmm wish I had room for the gyoza but sadly I wasn't that hungry even though on Monday's you get 3 for free with any ramen order.  No waiting when I went but I did go around 5:30-6 so I likely missed the dinner rush."}
{"text":"Ordered the shio ramen that comes with pork cheek on the side, along with an order of gyoza. Ramen had good texture, broth was tasty and not too salty. The pork cheek melts in your mouth! The gyoza was pretty \"meh\".  It came with 5 pieces and were nothing too spectacular.. could get the same level quality from a supermarket, but it wasn't bad.. just expected more from such a highly-spoken of restaurant.  The service is quick. Note that they will not seat your table until your whole party is here, which is kind of annoying but does make sense since it is such a small restaurant and the service is pretty fast anyway. The customer turn-over rate is pretty high."}
{"text":"{Shio Ramen with ikura (Salmon Roe) rice bowl & Melon Cream Soda}  @ Hokkaido Ramen Santouka  My favourite Toronto ramen restaurant!! Came here with the pleasure of meeting fellow foodies and discussing foodie things...Good food is completely necessary for any (foodie) meetings!It's actually been a couple of years since I've last been here! We came at 12:30 on a Sunday, and there was a small line up starting. But we only had to wait 10 minutes before we (5 people) were seated. 10 minutes later there was a huge line up already!! I ordered my usual shio ramen with the ikura rice bowl. I also ordered their melon cream soda which is pretty much melon soda with ice cream....HOW CAN YOU NOT ORDER THAT AFTER FINDING OUT WHAT IT REALLY IS RIGHT?!  Just like the first time I've been here, the taste is still the same! Delicious broth that is not too salty, but flavourful enough with the chewy ramen noodles. The pork belly on top was really good, still tender! One thing I would prefer is if the egg (which is on the side) was half cooked; where the yolk would still be runny but the outside is cook. But that's just me  I found out I had to tell them to cook it half cooked, so will do that next time! So yum, so happy I go to eat at my favourite ramen restaurant (in Toronto that is) again! I'm barely downtown, but when I actually am I'm only there to eat brunch  Definitely will return!!"}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say. Atmosphere is lively. Real Japanese workers!! (Thats not the case in NY)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 1:30pm,the restaurant is about 60% full with open tables, however they don't have hostess and it's a long wait to get a table even with open table.  Ordered the miso ramen. The order arrived relatively quickly ( about 5 min),    The noodle is relative mediocre, the broth is about at par with other ramen places in toronto, noodle itself is somewhat firmer then other ramen noodles I've had at other places, the pork meat is very tender which is good, and the broth itself is aboit average   This review has 4 stars because of the service of the waitress, she was very attentive and actually provided me with a basket cart to hold my laptop bag without me asking, she's pretty awesome!  The noodle on the other hand is relatively just average."}
{"text":"Don't have time to write a comprehensive review but here's my summary:  Service = awesome  Food = awesome Shio - Noodles were soft just the way i like it and the broth was very flavorful Aji-tama - OMG this is amazing...cooked perfectly with the yolk slightly runny Gyoza - small, delicious pork dumplings  Value = good Ambiance = moderately loud, casual  Only thing to complain about was the lineup. I was huuuungry! Waited about 15mins to be seated but we were served quickly :)"}
{"text":"Across Eaton Centre in Toronto Downtown, we found Canadian Santouka Ramen. This was a beautiful building and looked like a restaurant with waiters. Unlike the establishments in California, which are always part of the food court of Mitsuwa market. They may look the same, but the taste was the same. Amazing same recipe.  At this location, we had a  * Shio Ramen (3 of 5) * Kara Miso Ramen with Stewed Pork over Rice COMBO (3.5 of 5) Bigger meal.  The place is pretty clean and cozy but since the taste is not different from California, I don't need to retry it when in Canada."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Price: More than an average dt ramen place at $14 a bowl. I got the Shoyu Ramen.   Noodle: Al dente, bouncy.  Broth: Amazing. I usually don't drink the broth but the Hokkaido's is so flavourful. Asked for less salt which was perfect. When you walk into the restaurant, the first thing that hits your nose is the smell of pork bones simmering away. You can also ask for less lard but why.   Toppings: I love bamboo, glad it's included. I also had seaweed, slice of fish cake and green onion. Extra toppings are pricey (corn is $2.50, egg $1.80) which I didn't opt for.   Chashu: Seems like I got the chashu scraps...got two small chunks of meat cut along the grain and a slab of pure fat. While it was tender, it was upon leaving the restaurant and seeing the display of noodles that my friends told me that they both got 2 regular slices of chashu. What the.   Service: Friendly. Fairly quick turnover of tables.   Bathroom: The sketchiest bathroom I have ever been in. My friend said it was like being in a horror movie and I had to agree. Dim eerie staircase leading to a dark dirty bathroom with a low ceiling. Given how popular and clean the restaurant is, they definitely could have forked over a little bit of money to improve the washrooms!"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"My go to spot whenever I am in the mood for ramen. There might be a queue if you're going during peak lunch times but if it's not too cold, the reward of a hot bowl of ramen is totally worth it. The soup base is one of the best in the city if not the best. I've heard from the family I was dining with that the noodles are not al dente as other places but it didn't really bother me so 5 stars."}
{"text":"I ordered the set combo..which included Karamiso (spicy miso) ramen and a miniature rice bowl with pork.   Waiting time: 45 mins Ramen: Soup is rich and at right temperature..but a bit too salty for me... the texture of the noodles is al-dente....disappointed with the slice of pork that I have...it all fat!...  anyways, worth to try.....and might to go back when the line up is not too crazy!"}
{"text":"Miso ramen is one of the best I've had in toronto. The rice bowls are so incredible although the portion is small it'll still fill you up. Best day to come in on Monday because you get free,  amazing, dumplings along with your ramen.   Come early because the lineups are ridiculous once it gets colder outside!"}
{"text":"\"That was so GOOD I think I should leave a review\"  Visiting from Los Angeles, and picked at random. My boyfriend and I were completely blown away. So delicious and such quick service!  Wish it was back home."}
{"text":"Favourite ramen shop in Toronto!  The broth is very flavourful, and unlike other ramen places in town, doesn't leave you feeling bloated and gross afterwards (similar to Japan).  The pork jowl is the perfect combination of fatty, flavourful, and tender, and goes really well with the ramen.  The noodles are thin but kept to a nice level of chewiness.  I also like how you can ask for less salty broth: it manages to retain a lot of the flavour without the sodium hit.  Overall, be warned, it's on the more expensive side.  Never end up paying less than $20pp after tax and tip."}
{"text":"I'm new to ramen so bear with me. This place was great experience wise, so great. Nice atmosphere, bustling with people, quick, super friendly service. The ramen was definitely still good, just not AS good as Sansotei (the only other ramen I've had, I warned you, bear with me haha). The pork belly was a touch fatty and I found myself adding a bunch of extra items to the broth (soy sauce, vinegar, etc). Also, paying extra for an egg? Not so great."}
{"text":"One of the best places in town for Ramen. I am not sure that they take reservations but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Out of the many ramen places I've tried I would say that this is the second best ramen place in Toronto, next to Sansotei. (This of course, is purely personal preference). i ordered the Miso Ramen, which came pretty much 2 minutes after the order was placed. (I also came on a week day evening so I didn't really have to wait in line either). Although some people may argue that the portion isn't that small since the bowl is quite deep, I still found it slightly unsatisfying compared to other ramen places I've tried in terms of portion. There really isn't that much ramen, mainly soup. It is also hard to finish the soup, because it's not hearty and delicious like Sansotei, it's mainly just salty. Flavourful, but VERY salty. The meat is also less delicious than sansotei, no melt in my mouth pork belly, just tough pork. Well flavoured, but tough.   Overall I say this ramen place is ok, but with its price and portions I probably wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"The experience I had during my last two visits have not be so great. More than half of the meat that my family and I had were just fat. And since we don't like to eat lard, only less than half of the meat were actually consumed.  They often have a line up but sometimes it can get messy and they take the names down of the people who may come after you did without taking down your name. When I tried to tell the host that we have been waiting in line for a while even though our names were not taken, she physically pushed me away without listening to me."}
{"text":"I was craving ramen since this afternoon...and made the mistake of choosing this place.  The ultimate special is an order of Chirashi and Shoyu Ramen.   The sashimi was absolute crap. The salmon was an eerie pink.. Like it was made to soak in radioactive fluid. The shrimp was picked fresh from the frozen food aisle of T&T... And the ikura may as well have not been there..   The ramen had two skinny chopstick shaped pieces of pork - no more like two french fries. The soup was decent. The noodles itself were stale.   I came out craving for more ramen. The girlfriend... boy oh boy, she ended up footing the bill and she was NOT happy."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to warm up for a quick lunch. I stopped by for a bowl of ramen before heading to the Royal Ontario Museum. It is nice there is small, regular, and large portion. A small bowl of Shio (Salt) Ramen warmed me up. The broth was not too salty; bamboo shoots, pork, and other garnishes were proportioned well to the noodles. I must have come at the perfect time because as soon as I started eating there was a small line waiting for tables. On a side note there seem to be a lot of ramen places in Toronto."}
{"text":"always a wait which is slightly annoying but as soon as I'm seated and my food arrives, I realize it was all worth it  the pork cheek is so soft, melt in your mouth deliciousness."}
{"text":"I went here on a Tuesday evening around 8 pm and only had to wait around 10 minutes for a table for 4. Going here the day after going to Sansotei, I had really big expectations for ramen.   My first thought on seeing the menu here was \"holy so expensive?!\" The ramen is minimum $2 more than Sansotei, and if you get their specialty ramen it's over $20 per bowl. Nevertheless, I ordered the spicy miso ramen with extra noodles ($1 extra) and it came out to $17.50.  The spicy red miso broth was surprisingly delicious - very different from the black miso at Sansotei but just as flavorful! I loved the hints of chili in the broth here. The noodles are thinner than Sansotei, but I actually didn't mind the noodle consistency in the spicy broth. They also didn't add as many toppings as I would have expected. The portion sizes (for the regular) here are definitely smaller than most Ramen places downtown and pricier so keep that in mind. I got the large with extra noodles, which was super hard for me to finish myself though.   The only reason I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because they only do pork broth (no chicken or vegan broth). Also, the price is a little steep for me to come regularly. But if I'm having a craving for ramen, this place would be near the top of my list!"}
{"text":"This is 100% my favourite ramen spot in Toronto. This is as authentic as it gets. The flavours took me back to when I was in japan. The ramen is absolutely amazing, tsukemon (which is my all time favourite dish) from here is the best in Toronto for sure . And they have all of the same authentic desserts and sides like melon soda, cola floats, gyoza and more. If you're really missing japan or want to experience really good authentic Japanese ramen. I'd recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I had the kara miso ramen. It was good. I also tried their desert, the sundae for $5.75. I didnt like the desert. The green tea icecream was too strong for me."}
{"text":"The ramen place different variety of ramen including spicy ramen miso soup.  The vibe is like any other ramen places with wooden table and metal chair with light jazz music.  The service was okay as the servers didn't look too energetic.  Maybe they are tired from a long service period since lunch.  The spicy miso ramen  was extremely tasty with a smooth creamy soup base.  I absolutely loved the flavours.  I also ordered a iced oolong tea which was a good compliment to cut down the richness of the ramen soup base.  I also ordered the pork cheek marinated by soy sauce.  It was really really delicious also.  The store also prepared baskets for ladies or some gentlemen who carried bags witht them.  I thought this is really thoughtful of them although I don't carry any bags myself.  Overall, it was a little pricey for the ramen as I had better ones at lower price uptown.  However, it was a good place to try out if you are close by Dundas Square.  Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"If you're like me and don't want to gulp several glasses of water as a result of salt overload... make sure to order their less-salt Ramen broths. Simply ask for less salt when you order.   After I discovered their secret, Less Salt Shoyu Ramen coupled with the Yaki Gyoza became my order."}
{"text":"Miso ramen was delicious... firm noodles, salty (but not overly so) soup. We sat at the bar and watched the noodle pots fill up and boil away. I ordered the small bowl and it was the perfect size for an early 4pm dinner. Service was fast and pleasant."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for my ramen craving.   Its a nice place, clean and organized , also friendly (everyone who works there welcomes you as soon as you walk in)   Food was delicious!! The bowls looked cute and the portions they have was just enough to fill me up.  Price was about $27 for 2 ppl     The only thing I didn't like was probably the seating,  they would have you sit next to somebody  that is nearly a couple inches from you.   Parking  is $3.00 for half an hour   Definetly worth a try"}
{"text":"Santouka vs Sansotei. The 2 best ramen places in TO.  My vote is for Sansotei as I like its milder broth & is slightly cheaper."}
{"text":"By far my most favourite Ramen place in Toronto.  Actually the only other one that I enjoyed more than this was the Ippudo in New York City.  I usually pick the light salt, light lard version of the Shio Ramen.  I think it's better when the soup base is lighter, it really allows you to enjoy the noodles more more than with the heavier salted Miso or Shoyu versions.  Rice bowls are great too, the combo is nice and try it with Asahi Black.  Something about Asahi Black just makes it go so well with Ramen!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I really enjoyed everything about this place.  Food: 5/5. The ramen was definitely one of the best I've ever had. It was so meticulously plated and well-crafted, not to mention tasted perfect. Not too complicated of a broth but very well harmonized flavors.    Service: 5/5. Very friendly and attentive staff. You can tell they really try their best to make sure you get the service you deserve as the customer.  Atmosphere: 4.5/5. It's a small restaurant but I really enjoyed how they set it up. It was a very pleasant environment to be in and I would come back a million times if I lived closer. The only thing is the bathroom. You have to walk down these narrow stairs in the back to get into a hallway that's sort of miniature sized. It was interesting and a little cute, I didn't mind but it may be a bit off-putting to others.  --  I really like this place. Wish something similar would open up closer in my area."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Ramen in Toronto, purely based on the taste of the Ramen. Rich in flavour. Simply perfect Ramen. Reminds me of Japan. Only slight negatives, must have full party before sitting and they seem to rush you out. But food and value is exceptional."}
{"text":"Fantastic ramen! You will probably have to wait awhile to get a seat (for pretty much any group size) but the wait is worth it. I've had a few things from the menu and everything, so far, has been amazing. The broth is unreal. The prices are very reasonable, although more than your average place-- but the quality is way above average."}
{"text":"I had the kara miso ramen and it was one of the best soups I've ever had.  Just the right amount of spice and saltiness...and so savoury.  Noodles where cooked perfectly with a tad of resistance and not to soft.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I was keen to try this place for a long time. Its always mobbed so I snuck in around dinner while waiting to start a shift at work.   The service was good and it has proper ramen feel but I'm afraid my ramen inexpensive got the best of me. I ordered the normal shio Ramen. It was super duper salty. Like desert island for the rest of the day salty. I have since learned after the fact that you can order reduced salt versions or a miso based broth. I will try that next time."}
{"text":"The regular spicy miso ramen is $11.45 before tax. There is an option to either make it large or small for +$1 or -$1, this affects the amount of noodles you get. Unfortunately, the \"regular\" in this place is equivalent to small in other places, the \"large\" is regular, and the \"small\" is child-sized. You have to order DOUBLE large ($2) to get the equivalent amount of noodles of other places.  This wouldn't be bad, but their pork belly is also small and thinly sliced! Most places provide 2 pieces of pork belly in their spicy ramen, or 1 piece plus ground pork. In order to get the equivalent amount of other places, you must order the double portion, which costs $13.30.  Therefore, the true cost of the spicy miso ramen before tax is $15.30, making it by far the most expensive of the ramen joints. Does that mean it's the best?  The standard pork belly is okay. The Toroniku, which has an even greater price premium, is pretty much a high-class cut of meat without any fatty bits. Western diners who are only used to lean cuts of meat will probably jump at this because it's easy to chew on. For the rest of us, the premium isn't worth it.  Santouka's rise to fame is its broth. It's excellent, but it falls just short of Sansotei in my opinion.  Not only is it the most expensive of the ramen joints, its default servings are also the smallest. If you don't mind paying nearly $20 after tax and tip for enough ramen to fill you up, then you'll like this place. It's not that the place is bad, it's just that it's too overpriced for what you get. Sansotei is my favorite because it doesn't hurt my wallet as much, and I can actually leave full and satisfied."}
{"text":"If there is a no star button, I will not even give them one star.  It's a Thursday afternoon at 3:30pm, my husband and I felt like we need a snack so I picked a ramen place. We went in with our 6 years old. After we placed an order of two $12.45 a bowl ramen, the server told us we do not meet their minimum order. $9.75 per person and my 6 years old needs to order something. Which to me, they are tell me to tell people, DON'T BRING YOUR KIDS! I forced myself to order something more and hoping the meal will make me feel better.   The quality of the meal, you can see my picture and tell me. - Ramen is super hard and undercook. - That egg is definitely not a 1/2 cooked boil egg - the rice is tasteless, I need to add soy sauce myself   This is just my experience and you can try for yourself."}
{"text":"While in Toronto for a quick visit, we were fortunate enough to be located a stone's throw from this ramen spot. It was sweltering downtown that day, and I wasn't particularly down for steaming hot ramen, but I'm sure glad Gretchen P managed to convince me to head here for lunch.  First of all, they have a bit of an odd policy when it comes to seating. We were waiting for one more friend to join us, but they have a strict policy that they only seat the full party when every guest has arrived. This left us waiting in the tiny entrance way for about 15-20 minutes while several others guests were seated before us. It's a super busy spot, so I can see why they are so strict about this, but it was a bit disappointing when we were so hungry and it was so warm out!  When we were finally seated, we sat at a counter in front of the kitchen, which was fun as we could watch the chef's prepare the food. I ordered the cold ramen salad, which isn't something I'd normally do, but it was SO hot, I couldn't stomach the thought of traditional ramen. This was honestly one of the best lunches I've ever had! It was basically ramen noodles and broth on top of a crisp salad with romaine, tomatoes and fresh succulent shrimp. It was positively divine!  I ordered the original, though it is available in spicy as well. There was a note on the menu that this is only availably seasonally, so don't expect to find it outside the summer months.  The staff were sweet and efficient, and it was an absolute pleasure to eat once we were seated. I will definitely come back here for ramen when I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place serves some of the best ramen I have tried, and with fast efficient service. I compare it favorably to the ramen I have had in Japan.  When I find myself eating all the soup in the bowl I know it is top notch. I only tried the spicy miso ramen which was delicious.  Would love to come back for their other varieties."}
{"text":"1Sad. Salty. Underportioned. Small. Salty.   How does this place have 4 stars? Literally if you wanted good ramen you can go to Ajisen for taste, Kenzo's for portion, and Homemade Ramen for price. It all the depends on what you're looking for in a bowl of ramen.   This place was so disappointing I'm literally sitting here typing this review before I unfortunately pay for my food. I had really high expectations in depth of flavours, portion, and topping variety or at least the size of the toppings, and for such a high price $19.25 (tax inc) for a small bowl of SALTY ramen, it delivered nothing but to fill up my stomach.  I recieved about an inch by inch piece of pork belly and piece of pork the same size, maybe about 15 beansprouts, and 3 slithers of bamboo with a whole lot of green onions on top. It also came with a tiny handfull bowl of rice and char siu that had no flavour, half a boiled sad regular egg and 1 slice of pickled ginger.  Hello. If it's going to be practically a 20 dollar bill I expect tto be satisfied and happy I spent that money and I wasn't and I really regret going here ugh.   If you like salty ramen because your tastebuds have been overseasoned for so long by the North American culture be my guest and go here, tell me I'm wrong and you love it but I hated this experience lol."}
{"text":"Had a very delicious meal here. The ikura combo with kara miso was my favourite. Service was good and the place is very neat. We went later in the night and didn't have to wait for a table of 4. The bowl of ramen is not too big, but was enough. However, if your really hungry maybe upsize. Would revisit again."}
{"text":"The soup was not greasy and got flavoured with seaweed and soy sauce-soaked-pork, all tastes came into the soft noodles.   The servers were polite and passionate, they say greetings out loudly every time when there's customer step in."}
{"text":"I've tried just about every ramen restaurant in the Toronto area and Santouka is by far the best one.  I've also tried the original Santouka in Vancouver and the Toronto location is consistent in quality and taste.  I've been back to Santouka multiple times.  I suggest coming late or early on a weekday if you don't want to line up, although lately in the summer the lines have shrunk a little.  I'm going to attribute that to Ryerson students being off and a surge of other Ramen restaurants opening (Raijin is just up the street but not nearly half as good).   My go-to is the spicy ramen, but the shio and shoyu have their own merits.  It's not too spicy and they give you a large class of water to cool you off if it is.  The noodles all come with pork slices and other assorted toppings  You can choose to upsize your noodles or toppings as well.  Tip: You can request for reduced lard and salt if you're looking to be more \"healthy\" (let's face it, this has about as much nutrition as mcdonalds).  Two great side orders are additional tender pork slices (they will literally melt in your mouth and are great for dipping into the soup) and the gyoza which is not cooked from frozen like some other restaurants.    Service is quick and friendly.  I'm positive all the wait staff and cooks are Japanese, which adds to the ambiance.  Servers take your orders on their phones and due to the busy-ness, will be quick to both serve you and clean your table when you're done eating.  Don't expect anything more than a 30-45 minute meal.  This place gets 5 stars because it is simply the best tasting ramen in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went here today with two of my friends. I got the shio ramen but the regular size portion was a little small, probably should have upsized to a large portion for an extra $1. I also don't like how an egg is not included in the ramen, you have to pay extra. A lot of other ramen shops already include an egg for no extra fee. Otherwise my experience was nice. The place is quite cozy and the waiting stuff is good."}
{"text":"Go to Sansotei! I think the noodles there are better anyways. Came here really early one day, it was not busy at all and there were no lines. Apparently they have this policy that if your whole party is not here they can't seat you. I totally understand policies and I am all for them, but I also think that if you are in the service industry there needs to be some sort of flexibility and situation-based decisions. I know other restaurants have policies such as they cannot seat you until at least half of your party is here especially for parties of 6+. Or they may choose to enforce only during busy times such as night time and weekends. But to not seat me when the restaurant is obviously not full and not going to be any time soon and I'm only a party of two is I think a bit ridiculous. Not to mention they didn't have any seats for me to sit by the door and I need to wait standing there staring at all these empty seats when my hubs is parking and will be arriving momentarily. Seriously?!?  I almost feel like they want to increase profits at the expense of service and experience of the customers. The noodles were okay. I ordered the miso ramen, the soup was good, the noodles were okay, but the bamboo shoots tasted funny, not sure how they were \"processed\", but I didn't eat them. The meat was good not too fatty. The biggest difference is that the noodles doesn't even come with an egg, which Sansotei has. I like the egg, I often have to order it if it doesn't come with one. I didn't feel good about this experience. They also brought our bill before we even asked for it, they wanted us to leave right after we finished our food even though no one was waiting for our table. This experience definitely left a sour taste in my mouth. If I want to go downtow for ramen, I would go to Sansotei. Their ramen and service is better."}
{"text":"For a gal who loves noodle in general, I've always been a bit nonplussed at how I can't seem to get with ramen. There's something about the texture of the noodle and the heaviness of the broth that doesn't sit well with me. In particular, I've always found the pork slices it general comes with to taste and have the texture of the meat that my mother tosses into soup to give it the unami feel. I don't understand why people rave over this stuff!  Which is why I was completely taken by surprise at how much I enjoyed the ramen at this place. I had the pork jowl version in shoyu. The meat, bamboo and seaweed came on its own plate. The meat was tender, with the right amount of fat, textured in such a way that I would never have associated it with the rough 'boiled meat' feel typical to the genre, and generally delicious. I actually quite enjoyed it! I had a half booked egg as well, which was the surprising disappointment as it was completely overdone, and didn't have t golden orange liquidy yolk that I've come to expect.   I also had some sort of canned carbonated peach flavoured sake drink with jelly. While it was a novelty, I certainly wouldn't recommend it at $9.95 a pop.  All in all, I would come again."}
{"text":"Santouka has the best ramen I've ever had outside Japan.  Really enjoyed the flavorful broth of the Tokusen Toroniku Ramen and highly recommend it.  Our server spoke English well and explained the dishes, which was a nice change from other ramen shops I have visited in North America and Japan.  I would have given Santouka five stars, but service was unnecessarily rushed."}
{"text":"tastey ramen but one of the worst seating strategies around, there's always an avoidable wait if they'd just use some sense. guess they don't want to overwhelm the kitchen??"}
{"text":"A chain ramen in town. Good price good food. Service was great. No Wifi service as they maybe want a quick turnover due to a limited space in the restaurant. The pork cheek was so delicious as it was just melt in your mouth. This is a perfect place to eat quickly and go. The ramen was pretty salty and I drank tons of water after the meal. You can't make any modifications to the food. They were pretty strict with what offered in the menu."}
{"text":"A restaurant fable about common sense: Visiting Toronto for a few days, we stopped in here one weekday night at about 9:30 for a late bite. The place was mostly empty. We ordered two soups and an appetizer. The waitress did some calculating on her phone, then announced that we had not reached the minimum of $9.95 per customer. She said our total was about a dollar short. So we left and went to a nice noodle place two blocks away. Ridiculous and incredibly rude."}
{"text":"For someone who has been to Japan 2 years ago and had this every other day, I've noticed this is by far the closest to what they serve over there in terms of taste, favour, and presentation. However it is much more expensive..  @hangrymann approves."}
{"text":"We faithfully waited in the cold for 20+ min to get into this little ramen shop. Once inside, we did not regret it!  This chain from Japan knows their ramen. I ordered the tsukemen (dipping ramen), my husband ordered the kara miso tsukemen (spicy dipping ramen) and salmon roe rice side ($4), and my brother ordered the miso ramen with the chirashi special. The dipping ramen was good-not my favorite broth, but still delicious. The regular size was enough for me. Not so for the husband- he ordered a large and ate it swiftly. The thing about the tsukemen is that they don't come with meat so you'd have to order it on the side if interested. The noodles were perfectly \"Q\" and chewy. The tsukemen is not as fatty as some other places, but still flavorful and good.  Note: the chirashi special is not sashimi. It's rice with cooked/smoked fish, salmon roe, a sweet dried fish topping, egg, and a few other elements. I'm not sure it's worth the extra $10 or so unless you really are very hungry!   We all had warm sake with our meal and that is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Personally i think it is the best ramen in toronto. It is actually pretty similar to ippudo in new york.  soup base is awsome and pork cheek is delicious.  i love shio fav!   the downside is pricy and long lineup.  But i guess all the ramen places are not cheap. lineup - go before 6 to avoid lineup!"}
{"text":"Food: 3.75/5  Service: 4/5 (Fast) Note: Their prices are high but delicious.  (extra charge $1.80 for boiled egg)   We came here around 12:45PM on Sunday after visting AGO~ Infinity Mirror, waited about 15-20 mins to be seated at the bar which was fine since we were so hungry!!  I ordered Miso Ramen, and it comes with bamboo shoots, black fungus, fish cake, 2 small thick cut fatty char siu, preserved crispy plum, and green onion.  The food was overpriced, but delicious!! the noodles were chewy, the broth was creamy and flavourful however, the portion size was a bit small for the price.  Overall, I enjoyed my visit and would come back especially if they had a deal or lunch special !"}
{"text":"One of my fav ramens in Toronto, normally I love the shio ramen or the tokusen toroniku ramen, I love assembling the meat onto my ramen after it's delivered to me, the pork seems to taste less over cooked and moist, but recently I tried the spicy miso and it was pretty damn good too, that nice extra kick really elevated that flavour.  I'll always return to this ramen shop."}
{"text":"This is part of a global Japanese chain. They maintain Japanese levels of service, with very attentive waitstaff. As with many ramen joints, the noise level can be high, but that's just because ramen has a way of loosening people up (I'm sure the sake on the side helps a bit in this department).  As for the food, it's legit ramen. The tonkotsu broth is rich and creamy, as it should be. My only complaint is that it was a little too salty for my taste (I got the spicy miso tonkotsu broth). The real treat was the toroniku served on the side: a plate of braised, sliced pork jowl. It was perfectly seasoned and fork tender. I also added a side of the char siu, which was also tasty, but a bit tougher than the toroniku.  If I lived in Toronto, this would definitely be one of my go-to spots for when I need a ramen fix."}
{"text":"Finally was able to have a meal at this ramen place...previous times of going the place was crowded...but it was worth going, very good ramen"}
{"text":"I've been to this place multiple times because I really think their ramen is the best one in Toronto. The food was pretty good today, but what the fuck was with their service?? I was still trying to finish my ramen while the waitress brought the bill to our table. Sorry if we wanted the bill we would've asked for it. Then 20 seconds later she came back again with the card machine. At first I thought this is just how they do things considering it's a really popular spot, then I looked around and realized we were the only ones that were being \"kicked out\", and I swear we were being polite the whole time and didn't do anything \"crazy\". I was kind enough to leave a decent tip but sorry she didn't deserve a cent. The restaurant needs to spend some time training its staff how to be polite otherwise this would be the last time I come here."}
{"text":"Note- I am NOT a fan of Ramen- I would actually give this place 2.5 but i'll bump it up b/c if you were more fond of Ramen I think you'd love it.  I haven't tried the the other Ramen places in Toronto (Sansotei, Kinton) but have tried the lower end chains, (Kenzo, places on Spadina) so I have nothing to compare it to really.  The Good: -The broth is good, but I wish it had a little more depth of flavour.  Not oversalted, and they give you an option of choosing how much lard/salt you want.  I went full fat for my first try just to see how they make the \"original\" version. -The noodles are done perfectly- If you don't like them a particular way they will also cater to that as well. -It comes in 3 sizes, small, regular and large.  I love this because the small is JUST enough plus a little more than I want to/should eat for a meal. -Get the soft boiled egg in anything you get.  really.  The meh: -The interior is nice, but not any nicer than any other place.  Ditto with service. -The cha siu was ok.  I'm not a big fan of pork anyway, but they certainly didn't make it spectacular enough for me to push me to like it.  The bad: -It's expensive for what it is.  It's good, but just a couple dollars more than I would like to spend.  Especially because it's not much of an \"experience\" either- you aren't here for any \"seen and be seen\" deal. And you aren't neessarily paying for PRIME real estate- even tho it is dt. -The wait- we waited quite a long time on a weekend night.  I would never wait in line again.  My date and I just weren't particularly hungry and were pretty set on trying smthg new in the neighbourhood.  Overall I would never CHOOSE to go here, and certainly would NEVER wait to come here.  But if my friends really wanted to eat here and there was no line I wouldn't be opposed at all.  It's good enough."}
{"text":"Came to Santouka for a late dinner at 10 PM on Labour Day, and nice to see that they were still operating regular hours and closing at 11.  When you sit down, they offer a \"bag basket\" where you can place your bags or purses, which is a nice gesture because I'd prefer not having to put a bag on the ground, or taking up the seat beside me.  The menu comes with several different types of ramen,  We ordered the shoyu and miso, at $12.45 each. For an extra $1, you can upsize it to a large bowl which they claim is 1.5x larger than their regular size. You might as well throw in the extra dollar! The bowls do not come with egg however; it costs $1.60 to add an egg. I don't know if this is all bowls, but the two bowls we ordered didn't come with an egg. At least, the staff had informed us that we needed to add an egg.  Bowls arrived within 5 minutes. The large bowl is definitely larger than the regular, with more noodles, broth, and toppings. The broth is quite flavorful and not very oily. There were 3 pieces of chashu, and they weren't particularly uniform in shape or size. One was long and ovaloid, another was short and round. But they were very tender and also flavorful. The noodles were not impressive, as it felt like I was eating egg noodles. It would be better if the noodles were a bit thicker and chewier.  The washrooms are in the basement, and not very accessible. The men's washroom comes with a baby-changing station, whereas the women's does not. An interesting option. Also comes with a bottle of listerine and some small cups, if you need to rinse off afterwards.  Overall, it's a nice bowl of ramen. The prices here are definitely higher than most of its competition, but if it's the closest option that you have, it's still a nice meal."}
{"text":"This is the second ramen place I tried in Toronto during my visit.  I assumed the line and the wait would be very long if I go during regular lunch/dinner hour.  So I went there about 20 minutes after they opened on Sunday.  I got seated immediately.  I ordered the original ramen (shio) and it does not come with the egg.  The service is okay and nothing special.  They put me at the bar since I was by myself.  I don't mind this at all and was able to see the operation in the kitchen.  The broth was rich and got the right flavor.  It is similar to Kinton Ramen broth, but I like Santouka's broth better.  I like the things they put in the soup but disappointed to find out the ramen noodle is from package and not freshly made.  I would go back to Santouka if I am ever in town again and try their other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Best Ramen place in downtown Toronto.  Better than Sansotei/Momofuku.  Very authentic feeling, even down to the plastic displays in the window showing what the meal looks like (just like in Tokyo).  Only downside is that it's very busy, so prepare for lineups and waits."}
{"text":"The best ramen place I've ever been to. Especially when it's -15 and your freezing your butt off! I like how it's only 5 minute walk from the Eaton Centre. I ordered the Shoyu ramen and gyoza, DELICIOUS! The ramen was amazing and the gyoza was fresh since it's handmade. The service was good and very attentive. Pricing was reasonable. Will eat here again :)"}
{"text":"Toroniku kara miso spicy ramen is the best!!!  Soup base  was really delicious,  texture and taste of the shimmered pork jowl was simply amazing.  Tiny place, either go super early or late to avoid lineup. Will def go back and try other things in the menu."}
{"text":"This place is one of the better ramen places with easier parking than most ie momofuku, Kinton, sansotei so that's a plus for me. We waited about 20 min on a Sunday night but it was worth it. The staff were helpful and friendly. They serve food quickly and turn tables efficiently. The price is not bad but the broth was too salty. Overall, delicious food for a reasonable price. I would be back in a heartbeat if I was in the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place! It's the best ramen outside of japan. Skip sansote, skip Kenzo, skip kinton. This is the place. I admit not everyone can get used to the taste of the bamboo shoots but the soup is so flavorful and they have delicious melon soda."}
{"text":"Anticipate long lineups because this place is nearly always packed!  Having tried a few ramen stores in the area, I must say that this place's \"Hokkaido ramen\" was as delicious as acclaimed and potentially the best contender around. The texture was just the right balance between chewy and soft, creating a filling but not stuffing meal. The soup base that I had (miso) was not too salty and the pork belly was tender, falling apart with every bite.   However, I would personally complain that the pork belly was too fatty. I also would've enjoyed the meal significantly more had they supplied a half-runny egg.   Overall, the price is slightly more expensive than other ramen restaurants but still reasonable. I mean, I wouldn't mind coming back but I also wouldn't wait in line again for 40mins to eat here either!"}
{"text":"Food is really good, taste fresh, meat are very soft to perfection. The line gets long and busy so I suggest to come early."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised to see this place while in Toronto. There is one in Mitsuwa in NJ and there's always a long line especially after 11am on weekends. Food tasted the same! Really great ramen and appetizers. Be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of ramen restaurants in the city and despite what others say, this one is my favourite! We had a party of 3 and were in the area for lunch so decided to try this place out. Unfortunately, we waited almost 30 mins.   I got the spicy miso ramen and it 100% lived up to my expectations. Unlike other ramen places where it looked way more spicy than it tasted, this one tasted like how it looked. Also, it wasn't the creamy type of spicy you often get at Japanese ramen places, which really floated my boat.   My friends who got the standard shoyu ramen loved it as well. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Walked past here with a friend while heading to Yonge&Dundas Square for a show that was playing. Saw there was a huge line up. Went to Y&D, after a while, got hungry and friend and I thinking of what to eat. Decided we'd come back to this place and there were 3 groups in front of us. Luckily we got there just before a wave of crowd started lining up. Wait time was between 40- 45mins. When we got to our table, had a look at the menu and ordered right away. 5mins later, shio ramen comes out- pretty fast. Soup base was good. Enjoyed it. But not really worth the wait. Would come here again if no line up. Place is just too small for a busy restaurant."}
{"text":"Ramen: The ramen and broth itself are still awesome. Service is still good. They're loosing 2 stars from my previous review because they raised their price almost $5 a bowl since the last time I was here (a little over a year ago) and they're using much less pork than before - back then, they gave you 3 square size pieces - now they you 2, thin rectangular size pieces. They're now charging much more for much less. Probably won't return - but will check out their new location @ Yonge and Eglinton when it opens - hoping the quantities of meat are better."}
{"text":"Delicious pork ramen noodle.  My only beef is that you have to order everything else piece meal ( seasoned egg is not included). But overall very good.  Waited in line not so good so maybe will wait for a sunny day to get to this spot again."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to über here for its awesome noodles! There was already a long line when we got there, but it moved fast, and we got seated after 15 minutes or so.   Everything on the menu is good, try anything and you wouldn't be disappointed, remember that you have the choice to ask for less lard(fat) for your soup if you want to be more healthy. Good place and would love to have their noodles again!"}
{"text":"In TO after catching a great flick at the Carlton.  Walked down to Dundas to try Ramen.  Yes there was a line up at 9:15pm.  Took less 30 minutes to get seated as the crowd eats and leaves at a steady pace.  It's a tiny cozy happening place on a Friday night.  Service is friendly and quick.  We ordered Gyoza, shoyu ramen, and #15 which we were told was popular.  It was all delicious and definitely worth a repeat trip!"}
{"text":"My friend & I were excited to try this ramen place out, but we were both very disappointed in the food and experience. The noodles were okay, but the broth was EXTREMELY salty. So salty to the point that neither of us were able to get past a few bites. We told the hostess about our situation and all she said was next time, ask for less salty. How would we know to order it \"less salty\" if it wasn't advertised as salty in the first place? She didn't offer to give us a new order, she didn't offer a discount, and she didn't even offer to replace the broth (we honestly wouldn't have minded that!). Instead, we paid full price for a lunch we didn't eat or take home."}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of Ramen, so my review might be a little bit bias. The family wanted to go to ramen for lunch. Being a democracy and all, I decided to give in to the popular vote and go.   The place is very small. I hate waiting in line (especially when it is snowing and freezing outside), but unfortunately we had to wait. We waited for approximately 20 minutes for a table. Our party was big so we had to sit at two different tables.   The service was great and friendly. My waitress was always smiling and friendly. Unfortunately, her English wasn't the best, so we had to repeat the order a couple of times to get it across.   In terms of food, I was told it was very good. I don't like ramen in general, so I didn't really like the food. One thing that I can comment on is that the pork is Extremely Fatty. I ordered sliced pork for an appetizer, but it tasted like it was all fat. The meat in the ramen was also very fat. When I trimmed it, there was barely any meat left.   Overall, I wouldn't go back unless I was out voted again."}
{"text":"Came with two friends for their soft opening and was really suprised to see the lack of lineups, which was great as we got in without any wait... Interior decor was nice, but not too roomy. Service was very attentive and quick, and actually understood everything in english! cough.. kinton...   It was a soft opening so only a few options were available. No appies or specialty ramen, just the basics.  I ordered the Shoyu Cha-siu ramen (double pork) and my friends ordered the Shio Cha-siu ramen and a ramen I forgot. (something spicy with fermented beans...)   The ramen was very veryyy good. Noodles had great texture, and broth base was deep and flavorful.Overall, super tasty. However I was pretty disappointed that the toppings didnt include a soft-boiled egg (my favorite) and also the portions were a little too small. There's options to add extra pork, toppings, or make it \"large\" (I think extra noodles.), but at $12.50 a bowl (and i wasnt full enough), it was a little undervalued. The bowl honestly looked 2/3 the size or less than a bowl at Kintons. Just saying!   I left happy, will probably come back, but i might need two bowls of this stuff...."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the hype about ramen.  Came for lunch with open minded colleague and got the limited quantities only item of Toronika Kara Miso (16.40) & Shio (15.90) as recommended by server.  We asked what Pork Jowl as almost every menu item had Pork with it.  Server just said it was less fat than the rest of the menu.     Soup was very good but so salty & fatty.   Noodles were fine.   Still don't understand it.   And was it ever so expensive!"}
{"text":"I came here on Monday for a quick lunch and as soon as i walked through the door, they happily greeted me including the Back of the house.  Ordered Shio Ramen and it was very delicious dish. Creamy pork broth and pork marinated with mirin,soy and sesame is to die for. I would definitely comeback for more and try the other dishes that they have. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The miso ramen I got was great! The right saltiness and flavour. They got a dark Asahi too which was a great addition to the meal.  Watch out for additions thou - I've only added an egg and corn to mine and it came to 17$ or smth just for the ramen itself. Which really ruined my impression - it's just a bowl of ramen after all and shouldn't cost you 20$:/"}
{"text":"On a quest to try all of the Ramen places recommended by Taste Toronto and this one by far is my favourite.  Soup was rich and creamy, customer service was great, and pricing was fair.   We went around 2-3 so it wasn't packed. We got seated right away which was nice!"}
{"text":"You can tell how good / popular this place is by the long line up out of door on a subzero Toronto winter evening.  The wonderful ramen is worth the wait, definitely.   I rank this higher or at least in the same level as the more popular NYC ones that I frequent (e.g Totto), and one rung better than the likes of Momofuku.   I ordered a shio, a miso with cha-shu, plus a side order of jowl (pork cheek) meat. Yes, a lot of meat, and I am really glad I did. The meat is what really stands out, tender and flavorful, especially jowl. The shio soup base is a little on the oily side, but hey, this is Toronto, we need to build up some blubber for the blistering winter. :-)"}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy broth ramen with chashu and an egg. The broth was very flavourful but not creamy as I had expected and the noodles were not as great as I thought they would be. Kinda reminded me of mr noodles noodles. The chashu was good though, probably the best part of the meal. The egg was meh. I also thought the portions were pretty small and pricey for what you get. Overall I am disappointed. I have been wanting to try this place for over a year now and now that I did I really do not get the hype."}
{"text":"So good ... I just ate here , and it was so bomb I wanna order the same thing over and eat it again. Spicy miso ramen ... I tried to do chicken cuz I don't usually mess with the swine but since this place is authentic they don't do chicken. So I did the swine despite my wanna be vegan ways and let me tell you I don't regret it one bit."}
{"text":"Once in a while I crave a good ramen but it's not a food I frequently get. It's a bit too salty for my taste and the value isn't there. Even a large doesn't fill me up. I have a slight preference for the Chinese clear broth soups like at Magic Noodle but Japanese ramen is good too once in a while.   With this out of the way, you know I'm not reviewing it as a raving ramen fan or a ramen expert. I'm just reviewing this place as a regular foodie. Ramen has become somewhat of a fad in Toronto. Ramen shops have been popping up, mostly in the Downtown areas in the past 5 years or so. They make sure to let you know it's authentic by hiring Japanese staff and having Japanese writings. The hype is lost on me.   I still give this place a good rating because I think this place makes good ramen. The place is a bit small and if you come at busy times you might not get a seat. But if I review on taste, I really don't see any noticeable difference vs any of the other major ramen shops like sansotei or Raijin. For sure it's better than those Chinese ramen shops that try to copy Japanese ones. I think Chinese ramen is delicious too and Chinese places should stick with selling what they're good at instead of copying."}
{"text":"I'm a ramen lover and almost tried all ramen places in Toronto. This's still the best ramen in my mind. I believe they spent hours and energy on making such delicious big pots of soup. The combo of a rice bowl and ramen are perfect complement to each other and it only costs around $14. Even I'm living in Hamilton right now. I would go there as long as I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"You know a place is good when the employes and 99% of the customers are japanese, and line up around the block to get in. You dont really see that in other ramen places.   It's the ultimate ramen experience. Everything on the menu is awesome.   TORONIKU. Its pork jowl. I dont remember seeing this offered at any other ramen place.   Get the damn toroniku."}
{"text":"Best ramen I've ever had. I usually do never finish my ramen bowl since I'm not a big fan. My friend insisted for us to try this one and it is The Best ramen!!! A bit expensive, but I guess it worths it seeing the good taste. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best ramen place in the GTA. I have been to all the other ones - Kinton, Ramejin, Santosei, Ryu's Noodle Bar, you name it. Santouka has the best soup base and noodles, hands down! What I hate about it is the long waits, especially during winter. During its opening week, I waited about an hour and a half. Any other time that I have been to it, I waited about 45 minutes. Sigh but it is just so good. The only time I didn't wait for it is going when it first opens in the morning. I have brought all my close friends for a visit, and they loved it!   I can't believe I missed on this place when I was in Taiwan. I thought it was just another ramen place. Boy, was I wrong! My mouth is watering just thinking about their ramen! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is my 4th time being here.  I always come late at night or for late lunch (after 2pm) to avoid the rush hour line up.  This is one of the best ramen noodle shop in Toronto.  The soup base is on the saltier end, but the noodle texture is perfect!"}
{"text":"Our go-to ramen place in Toronto! We've been to many ramen shops and keep coming back to Santouka! The shop is small so there could be a wait out the door for this place, however we never mind waiting because the turnover is quick.   We always get the shio ramen with an egg on the side. We also get an order of gyozas to share. The shio ramen has a smooth broth. Their noodles are nice and chewy. Their meat is cooked well and perfect with their broths.   Overall, a great place for some ramen!"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday for lunch around 11:40 - I would advise getting here early as after we were seated the line was out the door (because it's close to eaton centre and Yonge Dundas).  I actually just got the salmon rice (considered a side dish) and the gyoza. Despite being busy, the staff were friendly and food came pretty fast. The salmon was seasoned perfectly and the gyoza was delicious. I'd come back again, if I can avoid the lineups!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen in Toronto. The tonkotsu broth is incredible. Service is great. Be prepared to line up out the door for dinner. I recommend this place to everyone visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"I give this place a solid 3.5 - I enjoyed the ramen, but I liked Kenzo better.    As starters, we ordered the SHRIMP & TOFU SALAD - it was light and very nice.  I liked the sides and portion of it, it's a great dish to share.  We also got the GYOZA, it was all right, I like Kenzo's better.  I think the sauce that goes with the Gyoza could be better.  They were average.  KARA MISO RAMEN.  It is the spicy variety of ramen, the soup base was good, a bit salty - I drank about 4 glasses of water throughout the night and still felt parched.  Regardless, the soup base is very rich and pork-bone flavour-fully.  It was good, the noodles were good but I felt were a bit under-cooked.    All in all, I liked this Ramen place, have I had better, yes, but am impressed with it and it a good choice.  Long line up, must wait but the staff turns it around pretty fast and the service is good."}
{"text":"You must get the pork jowl/cheek. I think it really made our meal. Just melt in your mouth, perfectly slow cooked/braised, awesome delicious-ness. My bf had the shio (salt) ramen and I had the kara-miso (spicy miso). Both were really good. Basics come with bamboo, chives, mushroom, and cha sui. We added the soft boiled egg.   Compared to the other major ramen places. I think santouka has the best meat (pork jowl). The broth is also pretty good.  I guess they don't have as much variety of noodles or richness of broth (the broth here is quite rich and salty.. So it's not for everyone). They seem to have a larger menu than other ramen places...With rices and salad dishes (didn't try these). Service was good (as the restaurant was at 80% capacity on a Sunday afternoon). Seating was a bit crammed but that the whole ambience !"}
{"text":"I was stuck between a 3 or 4 star rating, but decided to go with a 4 because the service was fast & the value was good.  Hokkaido is a pretty small ramen shop with 8 bar stool seats and tables seating maybe 24-30 guests. When my friends and I arrived on New Year's Day around 2:00PM, there was already a line formed outside. There's no waiting system, such as writing your name/number down on a list. You just wait in line and hope the people seated order and eat as quickly as possible.  Surprisingly though, I felt like the line went by fairly quick even in the blistering cold. We had a group of 6, but split up into pairs.   I ordered the combination with their spicy miso ramen & pork rice bowl. Toppings for the ramen are not included besides seaweed, pork, and spring onions. So, I added kimchi & a soft boiled egg to my bowl. Everything seemed expensive, but if you're from the US and convert the amount into US dollars, it actually came out to be an extremely inexpensive meal compared to most ramen spots in the states. Our food arrived pretty quickly and I was pleasantly surprised by the broth of the spicy miso. I'm normally not a fan of miso broth (it was their only spicy option), but it was actually tasty! It had good flavor, although it could've been spicier. The pork was prepared well and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The pork rice bowl was pretty average. Not bad, but nothing special. Reminded me of Vietnamese thit kho.   Overall, it was a solid meal, but I've had better ramen elsewhere."}
{"text":"Hokkaido Ramen Santouka is one of my favourite ramen places in Toronto. There is always a line up to get in - plan accordingly.  My favourite item on the menu is the ikura (salmon roe) bowl combination. I got the miso ramen. The ramen are crinkly and hold the flavour of the broth nicely. The jelly ear mushrooms and the bamboo shoots add texture and freshness to the bowl of warm ramen. The soft-boiled egg was well-seasoned and marinated.  My side of Ikura was delicate and delicious. The Ikura bowl was light and the juicy fish roe was fresh. The Ikura bowl is one of the reason Hokkaido Ramen Santouka is my favourite ramen place."}
{"text":"love the kara-tsukemen !!! Its the reason why i keep coming back  because their ramen are good but nothing special.  Kara-tsukemen bring something new and it is hard to find somewhere else!  It is spicy but not crazy insane like, so yoU can actually enjoy your meal. for those who like it really spicy it comes with extra spice that you can add"}
{"text":"The worst thing about here is the long line up to get in. The food is always fresh and full of flavor. Pay extra for the better pork its worth every cent as it just melts on contact with ur tongue. The food def makes up for the sometimes long wait."}
{"text":"As I was hanging out with E the other day, she suggested we go to Hokkaido Santouka Ramen which was relatively around the downtown area as we wanted to check out Muji and Uncle Tetsu Japanese Cheesecake. We, however, forgot about Uncle Tetsu that day.. ohwell, another time! :) .  We were seated fairly quick, and they greeted us with \"Irasshaimase! / ????????!\" when we stepped in. This is not new to me as most Japanese places do that whenever new customers come in. It simply means \"Welcome\" :) . I've heard this restaurant chain is big in Japan as well!  The design of the restaurant makes me wonder if an actual ramen restaurant in Japan is like that. They had a bar which you can face the chefs - for single seaters, and they had a slightly open area where you can see the chef pouring the soup into the ramen bowl etc. They also had those Japanese hanging door curtain things which are sooo cute! I'd love to go to Japan one day :) !  Their menu has both Japanese and English dictation and you can also customize your dish to your liking - by adding more meat, or vegetable (some with extra charges). You can also determine how hard or soft you'd like your noodle to be (as you can slightly read off from the menu), as E likes harder ramen noodles.  While chatting and waiting for our ramen, we've discovered that our server could speak fluent English, Japanese and Mandarin - which was super amazing, being able to cater to different speakers. I wished I was super fluent in another language.  Our Kara Miso Ramen came, and they presented it on a circle tray, with a wide spoon for our noodles. For those who have not been to ramen before, ramen restaurants have the tendency to give larger spoons... I'm not sure if this is a culture thing, or because of the type of noodles (??).  Kara Miso soup came with char siu/siew (Chinese bbq pork), bamboo shoots, and some other stuff I never questioned about, but they always seemed to be in ramen places that I go to. The bowl may look small but me and E got so full right after... because I didn't think I'd be full of my meal when I first saw the size of it.  The soup base itself was decently spicy - could taste the spice slightly but it wasn't overkill. Obviously the spicy level is based on your own personal tolerance of spice, as my spicy taste buds are above average in my opinion.  Hokkaido Santouka Ramen is definitely the place if you want a quick meal and that fills you up - great for Ryerson University students as this ramen stop is about a 5 minute walk from the university. However, considering the space they have, I wouldn't go with a big group to Santouka."}
{"text":"Came in twice while I was in Toronto. I was a bit surprises by the number of ramen places in Toronto. I visited probably about 7~8 of them, well, this one didn't really stand out.   The first time I came with my husband in mid afternoon so we didn't really need to wait. After that I had no intention to come back, but a friend insisted I should try the caviar rice with noodle soup, and there was the second time. Because it was a Friday evening we waited about over half an hour - not too bad compared to the wait time of totto/ippudo in NYC, but I honestly don't think it worth the time at all.   My friend taught me to pour noodle soup over the caviar rice and eat it together. It was not bad, but I can imagine you probably could find that in any decent ramen/Japanese restaurant. So, still nothing impressive."}
{"text":"With so many ramen shops popping up everywhere across the gta, this place was well worth the try. The wait was long but the food is good.  Larger groups are not recommended as it is always busy and limited on space...i found myself coming back every now and then...when i can be bothered to wait in line...check it out"}
{"text":"Three days in a row, I passed by this small locale and saw lines out the door. Initially I thought that they must be offering some special, however, it turns out that it's always this busy. We decided to go early on a Monday night. Luckily it was raining so not as many people were willing to venture out. Instead of waiting 30-45 minutes, we waited for about 15.  I ordered the combo meal: a regular size spicy miso ramen, which came with marinated egg and a small pork rice bowl. My bf ordered the special, jalapeno ramen. I think the ramens were pretty darn good, but wouldn't recommend the combo sides. Ajitsuke tamago (aka marinated egg) is supposed to be soft boiled with a runny yolk. Instead this version was way overcooked and not at all flavorful. And the pork rice bowl was pretty basic. Not bad, but at most mediocre.   I would recommend just sticking with the ramen, and not paying $4 extra to get the combo option."}
{"text":"We finally have the chance to try out Hokkaido Ramen Santouka.  This ramen place was recommended by many of our friends.  All of them said Santouka has one of the best ramen in Toronto and here we are giving it a try.  I would say Santouka is mid-size for a ramen place.  It could fit around 40 customers at a time.  When we got there after work (around 6:30ish), there was a line up already, but luckily we only waited for 10-15 minutes. The design of the restaurant is very modern, yet it also has a raw and rustic feeling.  It is very different from other ramen places we have been to where the whole place is decorated with Japanese decor.  This platform is located in the centre of the bar area.  Customers can see their ramen being prepared by chefs in the kitchen.  The wait staffs can also easily access this area, and making sure the ramen is served to customers the moment they are ready.  Santouka is famous for their Shio ramen as it is the only item on the menu when the very first Sankouka was found in 1988 - Hokkaido, Japan.  After having the first sip of the soup, I can totally understand the hype of this place.  The soup is pearl colour, very creamy, and has a very rich pork bone flavour.  We later found out that they simmer the pork bones for over 20 hours (before adding any other ingredients), coaxing out all the flavours and keeping the richness and purity of the pork bones.  Like most other miso ramen I had, the miso soup base was very rich but a little too salty. The ramen had a very good texture that was neither too soft or too hard and the pork had an even distribution of fat on it which made it very soft. The Grilled Salmon Bowl on the other hand was not that great.  It tasted very salty and fishy.  The saltiness of the salmon was to the point where you couldn't eat it alone, and had to eat it with rice to balance out the saltiness.  A sip of water was needed for every bite of the fish. With this combo, I drank almost 3 cups of ice water.  During the whole time at Santouka, staff were friendly and attentive to the customers.  However, in the meantime, we also felt like we were being rushed.  The wait staff was asking what we would like to drink the moment we sat down at our table.  Two minutes later, the same waiter came back to ask if we're ready to place an order for ramen.  They also tried to take away my ramen before I was done with it.  And needless to say the bill was brought to our table without asking for it.  We were not very pleased with their customer service.  If their service was better, our rating for Santouka would be much higher.  Bye for now Hokkaido Ramen Santouka, until next time."}
{"text":"Super flavourful ramen although pricey for what it is...   The place is very small and crowded, but service is not bad and the ramen was very good! I got the small shio ramen - noodles were firm but tender and broth was pretty creamy. It didn't have an egg in it tho, which was a bit disappointing considering price was $15 with tax (for a small!!)"}
{"text":"They haven't even asked about foods or filled water up. Just right after my friend finished his ramen, even though I was still having mine, Server came and put the bill on table and took his dishes. And came back to ask if we would pay with cash or card. I understand Santouka is always busy with such a long waiting line but there is no reason to be asked to pay for my unfinished dinner."}
{"text":"By far my favourite in Toronto. Get there early. Make sure your group is all there as they won't seat you unless everyone is there.   Remember, you have the option to ask for less salt and lard, if that's what you want."}
{"text":"Even though there is literally always a line, it moves pretty fast.   I've been here a bunch of times and I gotta say, it's probably one of the best ramen in the city (if not the best). I always order the shio cha su ramen (I believe that's what it's called) and it's so so so good. The broth is creamy and flavourful. The noodles are a nice thickness. The pork is super flavourful. The only downside is is that the price range is a little higher than most places for ramen (around $12-15.) Definitely my favourite ramen place!"}
{"text":"A little expensive but well worth it.  We had 3 people, they forgot to put in one or our orders(otherwise they would have received a 5).  Full of flavour, not too salty, meat nom nom nom."}
{"text":"Decided to try this for the first time. It's a relatively small store. Firstly, the ramen here is a bit more expensive than other ramen stores (starts around at $12). We ordered the Kara miso and the shoyu.  To start off I preferred the shoyu broth as it was very flavourful, the kara miso was alright but it wasn't too memorable. The toppings for the ramen is relatively minimal compared to other ramen shops (you have to pay extra for a soft boiled egg).  I didnt like the noodles. The noodles didn't taste that good (they felt a bit dough-y and eas a bit mushy on the outside).   I think I wouldnt come back again since it's relatively expensive and not that amazing."}
{"text":"We ordered the shoyu ramen, shio ramen, and gyoza. We preferred the shio over the shoyu, but they both tasted great. The ramen doesn't come with an egg, so make sure to add one on the side if you want one.  The seating is very crowded/intimate, so you'll definitely hear everything the table(s) beside you are talking about, which can be very distracting.   Other than that, the service and food were great!"}
{"text":"I have been to the competition numerous times and have learned to love ramen in Toronto. I ordered the shio. Service was ok. I never got the water I asked for.   I did not finish the shio. The strongest scent in the soup was a barnyard smell. I kept thinking, this smells like hoof. I finally found it so repellent I stopped eating. I'm hoping this isn't a prelude to food poisoning...  I MUCH prefer Sensotei!"}
{"text":"Consistently rated the best ramen in the city  Santouka tortures its hungry patrons with an overly long wait outside, made worse in the blustery depths of winters chill.  Anticipation builds as you crave the warmth of savoury broth while peering longingly at the happy people slurping away inside. I've avoided visiting this place out of simple refusal to wait an hour for a bowl of noodle soup.. it didn't matter how good this ramen supposedly was... ain't no way no how.  Today however, I caved.  Caught a lucky break and noticed that there was only one couple waiting outside and a few people in the doorway.  This looked promising.  I waited 22 minutes before I got seated hoping my patience would be rewarded.   The friendly and chipper staff sat me at the bar, took my order and within 2 minutes brought a heaping bowl of ramen and my side tofu and shrimp salad.  Using a minute to take the obligatory Instagram pic, I took a moment to notice the ingredients: a few slabs of fatty pork belly, bamboo shoots, slivers of wood ear mushrooms, scallions, a slice of pretty pink fishcake and the capper - one umeboshi (a tiny red pickled plum).  Judged on the flavour and temperature of the broth, the texture of the noodles and the quality of the toppings, Santouka ranks very highly in all measures. I opted for the shio ramen which jazzes up the savoury tokontsu broth with an extra dash of salt.  The broth is just about perfect with the right balance of fattiness and meaty goodness extracted from slow boiling pork bones and various aromatics.   The pork belly was fatty and tender (not quite as delicious as Kinton's slabs) but pretty damn good in themselves.  Noodles are quick cooked to the right chewiness and swimming in the delicious savoury tonkotsu broth.. I usually use the broth as a kind of sauce to which the noodles provide the vehicle for delivering the savoury goodness and I've never been one to drink more than a few spoonfuls of any broth in any noodle soups but I just couldn't resist slurping down a few spoonfuls of Santouka's.  Great stuff indeed!  All in all, Santouka proves itself more than worthy of the hype and rewards your immutable patience with some pretty darn delicious ramen.    Is it worth waiting an hour in the cold for?  I doubt that very much however, I would challenge anyone to leave unsatisfied.  Note - Santouka is a tad on the pricey side and the portions veer on the smaller side of generous (My ramen, side tofu shrimp salad and Coke cost me $27!)"}
{"text":"Came here after the initial ramen place we found on Yelp was closed. I am so glad we did! I had the spicy ramen with pork jowls.... so much yum! For the first time ever I finished the entire bowl, broth and all! I wish I had a place like this back home, but I definitely will go out of my way to come here whenever I am in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Again, I'm a total sucker for marketing and anything that is limited, I'm there. It's got to be good. Right? Right?   So, I ordered the Tonoriko Shio Ramen...  Here's my run down:  1) Started with the gyoza... It's homemade and was pretty decent but I like my Chinese dumplings better. I actually like wrappers that are thicker and therefore crispier. I also like dipping it in Chinese vinegar, the black stuff, not soy or worse, the HK style red vinegar  2) HUGE pieces of pork, a bit too fatty for me but very succulent. I like to dip it in my broth before eating it, but really good.  3) Ramen is perfect consistency. Just chewy enough! I don't like it too tough or too soggy.  4) Broth was quite thick and flavourful but a bit too salty for me. I still finished all of it though, so it couldn't have been that bad. Although it was probably bad for me...   Also, there is ALWAYS a line outside so be prepared to wait 10-20 minutes...   Happy slurping!"}
{"text":"Came here around 1:30 on a Sunday and there was already a line out the door in front of the storefront. Seeing that the place is a fair size and people are to eat and leave we decided to wait on line. We waiting maybe 10-15 minutes till it was our turn to get seated. We took three seats in front of their open kitchen bar style. They had a basket for us to put our bags and jackets in.   I tried the shoyu ramen and fried gyozas. The ramen was good, the noodles they use weren't the super thin or thick ones, but somewhere in between. They were cooked perfectly. The broth wasn't too salty. It comes with a few slices of chasu, bamboo, and fish cake. The only complaint I have is that the bamboo didn't have much flavor but everything else in the bowl of ramen was! The bowl may look small, but it was quite filling as I'm a big eater. They have an option of more noodles for $1 more or less noodles for $1 less as well.  Their gyozas are homemade, and they were fried perfectly, crisp on the bottom but not too burnt! My friend that had the spicy miso ramen enjoyed hers as well."}
{"text":"This is a really good Ramen place, they are very consistent definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Toronto."}
{"text":"Awesome ramen shop just east of Yong-Dundas Square. Their pork jowl is amazing."}
{"text":"Second time around was much better.  Probably because of what I chose.  The pork had less fat and the broth was flavorful.  Consider adding extra noodles, less salt.  I've been told you can request for 'less lard' as well.  But if I had to choose, I would still choose Sansotei over this place.  Average rating 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I been to a bunch of ramen places out there but this is hands down my fav. The broth is so delicious and it's so fresh and tasty. The staff are friendly with greetings when you come and go. Warning there are lines for this place 7 days a week so be prepared but service is quick and turnover is fast"}
{"text":"The service was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is closed quarters giving it that authentic Japanese feel. It seemed that most of the staff were Japanese.   I ordered the Shiyo cha siu ramen, it was flavorful, not too salty, the meat was tender and the right amount of fat. The broth was drinkable (if you know what I mean).   It loses a star for value. Almost $15 for a bowl of ramen is quite expensive. I know location matter but I won't be coming back often because of this."}
{"text":"Not the best Ramen in town! The pork all of us received in our Ramen was 85% fat. One of us ordered the Chashu with their Ramen and the meat was a lot skinnier but you have to pay a few extra bucks for that! The soup was also very salty.. The noodles kind of reminded me of instant noodles. But it was nice to be given the option for how hard the noodles are. Because there's a line up outside (don't understand why) the waitresses rushed us. They tried taking away a plate half full of food."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place but it wasn't as good as I hoped for. Overall it was quite good and when I first saw the size of the bowl I thought that the portion size would be pretty small but there were actually a lot of noodles. The ramen and a little awkward after taste though and they were a bit to heavy with the salt. The pork was good and soft."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  This place often has a line up during peak hours. If you are a party of 2, you have a chance to be seated relatively quickly. But if you are a party of 3, or - God Forbid - a party of 5 - good luck, sucker.   They do NOT seat you in the order that you come in. We waited for almost an HOUR and watched as new parties of 2 came and went.   This is NOT how it should be. Restaurants are supposed to operate on a first come first serve manner for seating. Figure it out, losers. Get your act together and fix your table plans.   Starving by the time we were seated, the noodles came very quickly. So quickly that it felt like they scooped it out of a slop pot and threw it at us, begging us to hurry the F up, eat, and get out so the next party of 3 could be seated.  The food was just OK. Even though I was starving. Honestly, I have had much better food before. Much. This is totally NOT worth the hype.  Never coming back to this place ever again."}
{"text":"If I could trust my memory like I trust in Panquela (my bestie from other lifes), I would shout from the rooftops/4 winds using Spanglish, that this has been the tastiest Ramen I had had in my life (TO is guilty of my infatuation for this kind of Japanese treat).  Because it has been a while since I went here; Mr. Winter is approaching; I really enjoy soaking up elaborated broths; and I'm making my list of best Ramens: I'm visiting them again (les caerá el chahuiztle)."}
{"text":"The best broth I've tasted at Toronto ramen restaurants. This place is one of my favorites, I also like Sansotei a lot. Luckily, I came here the few days before it opened and was amazed how many people line up for it now."}
{"text":"I came here quite a few times and the quality of the ramen has always been great and the broth they use is always bursting with flavours. I LOVE the shio cha-shu ramen - they serve the pork pieces on the side and it comes with bamboo shoots as well. I also add an egg because an egg is an essential part of any ramen! It is definitely one of my favourite ramen type and I keep coming back for more.   Be warn though that they will only seat you if everyone in your group is actually there and present - they don't have a lot of space but they also have the single stalls (similar to ramen restaurants in Japan). Definitely up there with the best ramen in town!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend who lives in the area and I had high expectations as it is my sister's favourite ramen house and my friends!  Noodles were great...I liked that there was a good amount though they were so good I could had eaten a 2nd helping!  My friend got the double starch special:  rice bowl and noodles.  I thought she was crazy but it is really good too and there's more than 1 option.  She got the one with scallion and dried fish...it was delicious too.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"It's me and my boyfriend's favorite Ramen place. One of the best. And customer service is really good too."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Monday, which coincidentally is the day where they have a special on where you get 3 pieces of gyoza with an order of ramen.  It's easy to get a table for 2 and we only had to wait about 5 minutes.  There was a group of 4 ahead of us that had to wait longer for their table.  Shio Ramen $10.95, Flavored egg $1.60 - It was creamy and delicious!  The egg was superb.  One of the best ramen places I've been to.  I couldn't finish the entire ramen and was thinking I should order the small portion next time for $1 less.  On the other hand, if the regular size is not enough, you can order a large portion of the dish for $1 more.  Since I didn't get to the gyoza after filling up on the ramen, they packed them to-go for me.  It was delicious later.  They accept Visa or Mastercard"}
{"text":"Whoa!! I was toying with the idea of going to Momofuku for a ramen lunch but decided that a) there are Momofuku places elsewhere, and b) I didn't want to pay inflated prices for what is essentially a Japanese street food. Based on my location and a quick Yelp search, Hokkaido Santouka seemed a good alternative and I was not disappointed.   The queue to get in seemed a bit long at first, but tables seemed to be turning over quickly so I opted to wait it out. Sure enough, before long I was seated and presented with a menu. I opted for the miso cha-shu ramen with a soft-cooked egg, and was served swiftly. The dish was sublime--extremely tasty broth and toothsome noodles with succulent roast pork and a perfectly cooked egg. I almost wished I had ordered a larger portion than I did but in fact the regular size was more than enough for a lunch. And the price--just around $12--seemed more than reasonable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is my second time here, my first experience was over a year ago and it wasn't a good one.   Coming here today was accidental, I intended to go to Sansotei but it is closed on Sundays so I decided to give Santouka a second chance.  We arrived at 4pm, there was no lineup outside and in the store there were about 4 empty tables, so we were seated right away. We didn't receive menus until I asked for it but I think that is because it was a server that seated us and not the designated hostess.   The server that took our orders was attentive and our order arrived within 5 minutes, pretty quick. I ordered miso ramen with less salt and egg on the side while my partner ordered the Kara miso ramen with less salt. We also ordered the melon soda with ice cream because it sounded intriguing.   The ramen were decently sized and was perfect with less salt (the last time I ordered ramen, it was without modifications and was too salty to be enjoyable) . The bamboo and ear wood mushrooms gave both ramen a nice texture. The only thing that can be improved upon is the amount of meat that is included in the bowl. For the price, I'd expect a little more meat.  As for the melon float, it was interesting but I prefer the soda without ice cream.   Overall this visit has been pleasant and I will come back when I am craving ramen."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on a sunday afternoon. it was a busy place and highly recommended by a friend. however coming here and trying their food service and environment, i find that this restaurant fails on many levels.   First of all. the minute we sat down, they had told our group of 4 that they initate a $10 minimum charge on every customer. which is ridiculous, we came at a 3pm time. which is not a peak period and on a sunday. charging $10 minimum order, even if a friend was just sitting around to grab a drink and hang out with friends is ridiculous. that part already for me left a bad taste in my mouth.  the other thing that gave me a worst taste is the food themselves. i had ordered a cream soda with ice cream, the steamed pork jowl, and a spciy ramen noodle with pork jowl. Aside from the fact that the portions for the noodles and pork jowl for the price you pay is not good. i was expecting quality to me much better since the portion is small. no such luck.   The noodles were clearly whole bought instant noodles. if your going to be called a ramen place especially a more authentic one, at least make some fresh ramen or noodle. giving customers instant noodles and charging over 12 dollars a ramen for that small a portion is insulating to say the least. also the steamed pork jowl lacked actual flavor and it was literally steamed with barely any marinating. which they also charged 6.99 before tax and tip.   the soup which is the most important part of a ramen along with the noodle. was definitely nothing special.   Overall from service to food, and even restaurant outlook its all below average at best.  i would not recommend anyone try this place, save yourself some money and go to other ramen places. considering all the ramen places available in the area, you are not missing anything from avoiding this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried out this place yesterday and I don't get hype. Ordered the chasu miso ramen. The portion is way too small for the price ($16). The chasu (pork) slices are so thin and small compared to other ramen places such as kinton. Egg cost extra.  Quality is average, nothing special and broth is a little too thick for my taste. Food came pretty quick but I don't really like their service because they put me right in front of the kitchen which is extremely hot on top of the already heated weather despite being pretty empty and rushed with giving me the bill without me asking."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night. Ramen was good! But... I've never felt so rushed before!! From the moment we sat down, we were asked if we were ready to order every few seconds before we even had the chance to look at the menu! From eating to getting the bill, it felt like were being timed! I think we only spent 15 min dining at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love dip ramen. Tsukemen ramen to be accurate.  And any place that offers it is always a must try in my book.  This place offered soya sauce ramen and spicy soya sauce.  Both were pretty good and the ramen was was chewy and thick. That's what she said. The egg was also well soft-boiled.  This tsukemen dish also came with 1.5 extra portion of ramen, which made it super filling, even when split by two people.   The only problem was that my friend and I were trying to just eat a quick snack and share a dish, but the waitress said that each person had to spend at least $9.95 each.  She wouldn't budge when we were only 30 cents off, so we were forced to spend money on a side dish of corn (the tiniest portion of corn you can imagine).    A great place for ramen. Just keep in mind the mandatory 9.95 purchase."}
{"text":"I got the Shoyu ramen and it tasted pretty good! Pretty standard and nothing too spectacular. 3.5/5 since there was no egg and the broth was a little bit salty. I had to add some of my water into the soup just to dilute it down a little bit."}
{"text":"This place is not bad. I like how they serve Asahi beer. The ramen is like your typical ramen bowl, nothing mind blowing but it's also not bad at all."}
{"text":"An excellent ramen place on Dundas, this place is part of a Japanese Ramen chain. The food is pretty awesome, albeit the service can be terrible at times.  I usually order one of the ramens with an egg on the side. I have been ordering the spicy miso ramen, and it is great. Really spicy, smooth broth, smokey char siu, crunchy bamboo shoots. Albeit the egg has been a bit overcooked a few times.   It might be a bit too salty time to time, beer solved this problem. Its an ok place to have lunch, but I won't be waiting in line anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a solid ramen spot considering we're in North America. Honestly, the best ramen we've had are in Hong Kong and Japan so this doesn't really compare but relative to other ramen joints around the continent, this is definitely one of the better ones. The soup is rich, creamy, and porky and the prices are very reasonable. The gyozas are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Decent ramen (although not my absolute, hands-down favourite in the city). I've visited a couple of times, both at off-peak hours (once around 11:00 AM on a weekday, and another time around 9:30 PM on a Wednesday evening), as I've heard about the crazy line-ups and I'm pretty sure I'd rather sit and eat right away than stand in the cold with my stomach sadly grumbling, watching people slurp up ramen noodles through the restaurant window, longingly.   I've had their shio ramen (a saltier broth) and their spicy miso ramen. Both times, I had the pork jowl as part of my meal and, let me tell you, it melts in your mouth like ice cream. Absolutely delicious, perfectly tender, and so flavourful. There wasn't even a minuscule of toughness in that piece of meat. The noodles are also perfectly cooked. While the broth can be a bit saltier than normal, and their portion sizes are slightly smaller than other ramen joints, aside from those very minor issues, Santouka serves a pretty decent bowl of ramen.  On our last visit, for two bowls of ramen, with tax and tip and drinks, we paid around $28.00."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Toronto! I always order the Kara Miso Ramen (if you like spicy!) and add Togarashi.  The line up takes about 30 minutes."}
{"text":"For those who have been to Mitsuwa, this is the same franchise as the ramen shop inside their stores!  We were staying only a 1 minute walk away and we came back here twice during our trip.  There was a line the first time we went and we only waited about 20 minutes.  We came when they opened the next time and we didn't wait at all.  If you love spicy ramen, this place has the absolute best kara miso ramen that I've ever had in my life (so far).  The second time around, I tried the regular miso ramen which was delicious, but it didn't \"wow\" me like the kara miso.  The broth is extremely flavorful and well-crafted and the amount of noodles in the bowl were generous.  I ordered the combo which came with a rice bowl (shredded pork).  The add-ons to your ramen (corn, veggies, soft-boiled egg, etc.) are a la carte and come in huge portions.  The handmade gyoza is also a great appetizer to start off with.  All of our food came out fresh, hot, and quick.  Sevice is friendly and efficient.  The restaurant itself is small, so it's not good for groups. There were only a few tables and bar seats.  You'll get seated quicker if you're in a pair."}
{"text":"Yum yum! Now this was the ramen experience I'd been waiting for. I ask my half Japanese friend for good ramen in Toronto and this was her pick! It was fast delicious and everything I expected. I tried the spicy miso and added an egg to it. So delish, remember to eat it fast so the noodles don't bloat up. Also, not a great place to hang out because it's so busy with high turn over. Happy ramen slurping!"}
{"text":"lunch meal for 2 people: $60+ parking at the parking lot around the corner: $10 flat rate weekend line up: 45 mins  We were seated right in front of the chefs, so we could see them cooking, nothing looked fresh to me, everything came in packages, even the meat. I saw them come out of plastic bags. I'm not sure if they prepare it ahead of time or what they do?  The place is a bit overpriced for ramen. Especially with so many competitiors around the area. The line up was extremely long for a weekend lunch, but I heard so many great things about this place, that we decided to line up anyways and see. I asked for less salt as usual on my soup, still a bit salty, but I liked the noodles, they have a very nice texture, however the pork wasn't that great, no browning on the egdes, just looked like it was steamed (inside a plastic bag?) the combos that came with the small bowl of rice wasn't good at all! and the egg, they need to figure out how to make a good boiled egg, it was over boiled, I can do a much better egg at home. I would probably come back if there was no other choices, but if there is, I wouldn't bother coming back."}
{"text":"Wasn't too impressed by this ramen place. Staff here were not very well coordinated and we soon found ourselves at a table for two when there were others who'd arrived earlier that hadn't been seated (we didn't feel bad as they were seated immediately after).  The menu is extensive, and very slightly more expensive than other ramen places in the area.   The service was lackluster and they were under staffed; we got our food quickly, but had to wait about 15 minutes for our bill and another 5 for the Debit machine.   Not worth the hype, in my opinion."}
{"text":"This ramen place is underrated from the other popular ramen restaurants. Their quality has remained over the years, and I am not disappointed at all. Although on the pricier end, it is around average price for an authentic japanese ramen.  Located east of yonge dundas square, the standalone building may be hard to spot at first; the environment of the restaurant is small but comfortable. Seating is first come first serve regardless the size of your party. So be sure to prepare for the chance of waiting in line."}
{"text":"Food is excellent!  My friends thought it was too much sodium and they didn't enjoy it very much but I loved it!  The food was so tasty and the environment is relaxing and chilled.  almost every time I come here, there are lot of people lined up to get in.  it's very authentic Japanese food which makes it such a pleasure to eat."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night  for dinner at 6 o'clock.  Super busy; we had to wait for 20 minutes before being seated. There are no (warm) areas to wait so my pal and I zipped up to stay warm. That being said, the turnover rate of patrons is quick here.  The menu is pretty large - there are a lot of apps and donburi's besides ramen.  Compared to other places that I've been in TO, we noticed that prices were slightly higher while portions were smaller. Good or bad? Not sure.  It was a-ok, nothing mind blowing and I would be a-ok if I didn't go back."}
{"text":"2nd best ramen joint downtown. The first i would have to say is sansosei. Very rich broth, again like any standard ramen joint they have the 4 main types of ramen. My fave one would be the miso one.Very rich and smooth the ramen is the perfect amount also comes with sewed, bamboo and mushrooms. Most ramen joints does not provide those add ons. Highly recommend you try this joint out."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better.\" is pretty accurate.  Let me preface this review by stating that I'm by no means a \"ramen connoisseur\", as I've only had ramen once before at Kinton Ramen on Yonge.  However, that one time at Kinton Ramen was a better experience imo.  The service was pretty decent.  They even brought me a hamper to put my backpack in when they seated me.  One peculiar thing that happened was that they gave me a glass of lukewarm water - it wasn't cold/didn't have any ice (-1 for serving me lukewarm water).  Next thing to note was the buttload of \"upselling\" that occurred here.  The first thing they mentioned when I got the menu was their special \"Chinese New Year\" special that costed ~$19, which included ramen and a drink.  Next, I asked my waitress if she had any suggestions.  She proceeded to show me a couple of the more expensive options that costed ~$15.  Nah, I was looking for the more basic options, just looking for a quick bite, so I chose the Shoyu Ramen.  She then told me that the large was $1.00 extra (wasn't even indicated on the menu).  I ended up just ordering the regular size.  She then asked me if I wanted to add any extras - egg, etc.  I got the egg, because protein.  The ramen only took like 3 minutes to make, so that was nice.  In terms of the taste, it was okay.  It probably has the nutritional value of a pack of supersized Mcdonald's Fries tbh - it was pretty salty - but such is ramen.  The ramen noodles were pretty decent, the pork and egg were good too.  I much preferred Kinton Ramen.  Their menus were better laid out, and you got to customize your ramen more.  Here, the menus were crappy quality with set prices + waitresses upselling.  Not down.  I ended up spending $15.60.  I feel like I could've got a nice bento box at a sushi place for this price, or got the same nutritional value and satiety from a box of fries from McDonald's for $3."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a coworker on a lovely Friday, and had an alright meal.  Santouka, being situated in a great location in the downtown core, does get very busy very fast for lunches and dinners, so we came a little earlier.  That decision was good because we were immediately seated (for two people) and were able to order right away. However, I did notice that the prices had gone up significantly since my last visit ~7 months ago. Most things had jumped 2-3 dollars, and made it feel quite a bit more expensive for what you get.  I ordered the kara tsukemen, which is the spicy soy sauce flavour dipping ramen. I have never had the tsukemen style ramen from Santouka before, so I was curious and wanted to try. The broth was tasty, but seemed to lack depth, which may have been because of the strength of the spiciness. The thick noodles were alright, being cooked well but not really picking up enough of the broth when dipping them in. In addition, the egg that comes with the kara tsukemen was essentially hard boiled by the time I got around to eating it, which was a bit of a disappointment.  Overall, the meal was alright. Given that I essentially paid ~$17 dollars for lunch before tip and didn't really get filled up by my bowl of ramen, I can't say I left feeling satisfied. Maybe I should come back for a regular bowl of ramen, but this was a relatively disappointing visit."}
{"text":"For a person who loves Japanese food and ramen, this place is right up there!  The wintery weather in Toronto made this place...heavenly.  The ambiance is perfect and just enough to take you away from the hustle and bustle of Dundas St.  The ramen was great and with a strong pork flavor which I love."}
{"text":"I love their cooking methods. Their noodles are the freshest I have ever tasted in the G.T.A I personally have some competition for the broth but thats not what I want to say about this place. Santouka has fine quality food and combinations but expect a line cause we had rougly a 25-30 minute wait.. Good thing we have a warm Winter with us."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check out this ramen joint for quite some time, but the long lineup was always a turn off. I finally went this weekend with only a 5 min wait! I ordered the Shoyu pork belly ramen, it was very tasty and flavourful! I loved the noodles BUT I found the soup base a little on the fatty side (It might have came from the pork belly). I also tried a few pieces of the pork jowl, which were very delicious. It says limited quantities but we were able to order it right before closing."}
{"text":"Tight little spot. Usually there is a line to get in every time I walked by. However, if you do manage to get in without a line, it is worth it. Ramen is delicious especially the spicy pork. Service is quick. No bells or whistles, just plain Ramen. Seating is pretty tight so taking a stroller would be difficult."}
{"text":"**4.5 stars**  Rounding out my Toronto ramen experience with a visit to Santouka after my best friend HIGHLY recommended it to me and insisted we go on her day off (even though it was slowing and slushy outside). We arrived at 11:30am to a short line up but because we were waiting for the final person in our party, we couldn't be seated yet (that's their policy). We ended up waiting for approximately 20 min. The place is small with limited seating so be warned.      The air has a delicious pork-y aroma and looking around, everyone seemed to be really enjoying their noodles. Once we were seated I ordered the Shio Ramen plus an egg which costs extra (boo). The bowl of noodles came with cha-shu, mushroom, bamboo shoots, green onion, a thin slice of fish cake and a picked plum. My husband ordered the Toroniku Shio Ramen which comes with the simmered pork jowl on a separate plate along with all the same garnishes as mine. His order had a good amount of meat compared to my two slices.  The verdict: The soup is incredibly rich and flavourful but a tad on the oily side. The meat was tender and delicious with a good amount of fat on it (unctuous and yummy). The egg wasn't sliced in half as I would prefer it but my dining mate noted that not cutting it prevented the running yolk from oozing out. The noodles were very delicious with a nice bite to them, possibly better than Sansotei from what I can remember.   I would rate this place as being on par with Sansotei in terms of quality but I found it a tad bit salty. I was feeling very thirsty all afternoon but I'm not sure if that's because I ordered the Shio (salt) broth (unlike Sansotei, they don't have a Tonkatsu broth). I also prefer the price point of Sansotei ($9.25) which includes an egg compared to Santouka ($10.95 + $2? for the egg). The Toroniku Shio Ramen is almost $16 which is just too much for a bowl of noodles. The bill for the 4 of us ended up being almost $80 after tip! I could have a pretty amazing Chinese meal, including fresh steamed fish for that price.  In the end, I would prefer to go to Sansotei for a very delicious bowl of noodles at a reasonable price point (and a perfect egg)."}
{"text":"I was craving for Santouka ramen since I haven't been there for some time. Use to come here every weekend. I always order a large Shio Char Siu Ramen with Gyoza. The broth is rich and creamy, the pork is very tendered and the toppings are just enough to make this bowl of ramen perfect. I simply love the fact that there's a red pickled plum in the centre of the bowl. As for the Gyoza, it's not the best that I've taste, but I still love it. It is a bit dry and I had to depend on the sauce for flavour. Overall, I consider this ramen shop the best in town. Also, from time to time they will have some limited product. This time there's a Spicy Combo Meal, which had a ramen, a bowl of rice and side dish that are spicy. If you like spicy food, you can try it out."}
{"text":"Little restaurant, very friendly staff :)  Glad they have a small bowl option. Got #3 Miso based soup and it came with a lot of noodles! Noodles were yellow, thin and little chewy, and the broth is very flavourful!! My only comment is that the soup left me quite thirsty, but the meat is tender and overall, the dish is delicious."}
{"text":"The hype is real and I'm kicking myself for waiting so long. Ramen is rich and delicious. Spicy miso ramen is not spicy just a little hum. Cute ikura (salmon roe) rice bowl was simply perfection and a great deal! Will be back for that pork jowl!"}
{"text":"It should come to no surprise that I am a huge ramen fan. I had some truly amazing ramen in Japan and have felt ramen-withdrawal since then. There are some good ramen spots in New York City, but none of them serve tsukemen, which is one of my absolute favorite finds in Tokyo.   Tsukemen, or dipping ramen, features cold, al dente ramen noodles that you dip into a hot broth, which is served on the side. When I found out that HRS served it, it went onto the calendar. BF had never had them before, so it was a first for him. I felt like I hyped it up so much beforehand. Thankfully, I think it lived up to the hype for him!   We arrived around 6:15pm and had a 10-15 minute wait. We were the last couple in through the door before they required everyone else to start a line outside. It got very long by the time we left.   I opted to start with a melon soda float, which the BF was skeptical of at first, but really enjoyed. I think he might have been his favorite part of dinner! We both ordered their non-spicy tsukemen and it was glorious - perfect al dente noodles with a tasty, hot broth on the side. I wish the broth was a little bit thicker so it would stick more, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.   Quick tip for my fellow US travelers, they don't take Amex."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant but it has gotten worse in terms of service. To make matters worse, we were waiting for tables to clear around 3 pm and they still required us to spend a minimum per person. All of us were not impressed by that since it wuld not have made a difference in terms of table space wheher we had 3 or 4 people seated. You still need a table for 4 with 3 people.  The food was not impressive and with the minimum charge, I was forced to order a ramen instead of an appetizer with a drink. I skipped the drink and just ate the regular miso ramen. One of my friends order spicy ramen, the other ordered some appetizers and the last just chose the pork. He was not a fan of ramen so stuck to a non-ramen dish.  During non-peak times, they should not enforce the minimum charge as there were no patrons lining up after us. I think the minimum charge had a sour taste in the group's mouth that the tips reflected their disatisfaction.  I likely won't recommend this place next time."}
{"text":"In the moment I slurped the first noodle, I realized why this place had so much hype. I was pretty crabby having to wait in line for 30 minutes FREEZING my tush off in the windy cold. Okay, maybe not the first noodle... had to try the soup as well before I could regain composure.   The interior is very small and cramped, even the stairs down to the bathroom are smaller than usual, and I had to duck my head down and almost CRAWL to get to the bathroom. I felt like I was in a cave... but hey, it was an experience! ;)  I ordered a Shoyu ramen for myself, and my boyfriend got the Char Siu Ramen. I won't say anything more about his soup than what he told me when I asked how his was, \"good\" - and then about a minute later his bowl was completely cleaned out.  My favorite part of my soup was the bamboo shoots, oddly enough. I can't really put my finger on what made it so special. The whole experience made me feel like I was actually in Japan while I was eating. It was a bit surreal.... until i ran out of soup. RIP HAPPY TIMES.   I have been to my fair share of ramen places, and so far this one seems the most authentic to me, and possibly one of the best I've tried.   If you want to come here, don't come during a busy time, unless you want to catch a cold! (Or just go in the summertime!)"}
{"text":"My Favourite Ramen restaurant!  For a first time experience I would recommeded the Shio Ramen or the Miso Ramen.  Only down side to this place is that it is really small and you might end up waiting 1/2 hour at certain times (mainly lunch time).  If you are wondering, 'Yes' it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite ramen amongst alllll the ramen places in Toronto.  I don't think I've seen any other ramen place with pork cheek, and pork cheek is awesome!  It's small but seating is comfortable enough.  The broth is overly salty like most, noodles just the right amount of chewy and the meats are extra tender.  They do politely try to hurry you out as there tends to be long lines at lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to make a trip to Toronto for the Thanksgiving week. Thus, after browsing Yelp for some good ramen, we had to drop by this place. We must have came at a busy time because there was a line outside. Since the reviews were so good, we decided to hang out in the chilly weather for just under an hour before getting seated at the bar. Luckily, we only had 3 people in our group. The place tends to have a pretty quick turnover as the ramen is served fresh, hot and quick. It may be a bit longer a wait for larger groups as the place is not too big. Once seated at the bar, we ordered some hot sake and the shio ramen. The ramen noodles were cooked just right, not too firm or overcooked. Very good consistency, and it soaked nicely in the delicious creamy broth. The pork belly was tender, juicy, and full of fat (my favorite). I went with the regular size bowl which was the perfect size for a meal that would permit me to still walk out without feeling too full. The hot sake was a perfect compliment to the soup and cold weather. I was not able to finish the rest of the broth as it was getting a tad bit too salty and I needed to save room for dessert. Overall, awesome place, pretty delicious ramen. It can be a long wait during busy hours, but the line does go by pretty fast. Worth the wait. Will drop by again the next time I am in Toronto. :)."}
{"text":"Favorite Ramen place that reminds me of Kyoto.   Love  the ikura combo meal.   I  usually go small size to leave room for desert.    Not as heavy soup flavor as Tokyo."}
{"text":"Returned here last night and it doesn't disappoint but service was not as good this time around.  The male waiters are not as attentive vs the ladies.     Confimed: the ladies are much better with the service here and this continues to be my go-to ramen place in town.  Food: 5/5, very tasty, I got the Kara miso ramen combo with salmon on rice with extra portion noodles.    Service: 4/5, they are nice but need to pay more attention to tables on getting water refills etc rather than being a little desperate about taking your empty plate lol.  Ambience: 3/5, a bit too close for comfort as you can often hear everyone's conversations and the screaming when there are new patrons or those leaving (personally, I can never get used to this)  Price 3/5, a little hefty price for what it is ($20+ per person with just the meal, no drinks). It's more than others in the area but still good."}
{"text":"When I was in Tokyo I enjoyed numerous bowls of ramen sidled up alongside the salarymen. There are so many places for a  500 yen coin bowl but somehow never had a very spicy bowl.  Too cold for you in Toronto? Want to eat like a salaryman? Then Santouka is for you. Its part of a chain of shops based in Japan and feature the Hokkaido style (miso and soy based).  The only problem is that it only seats I think about 30 people so you can expect line ups at times. Being near the Eaton Center and Ryerson will also play a factor during lunch. Lucky, for the diners waiting in line, many guests slurp them up and get on with their day. Service is fast.  What brought me here?  I was enthralled with having the fiery red Kara Miso Ramen. Mine was topped with those woody ear mushrooms, bamboo shoots and chunks of fatty pork. This is what warms the soul on a frigid arctic day and the broth is creamy. Now its not super hot spicy but it has just the right amount of heat to keep you happy.  From what I know the chefs are from Japan and they seem to have totally mastered the art of ramen here in Toronto  Ok now go watch Tampopo and the Ramen Girl  Now if we can get them to install a ramen vending machine out front we can enjoy the exact experience the citizens of Tokyo enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very good Ramen!  Probably the best I have had in the city.  We had zero wait time - 8 pm on a Wednesday night.  The selection of Ramen was simple and everything we had was excellent.  I will definitely return.  Staff were very friendly and food was served promptly."}
{"text":"This is my go to ramen restaurant because of the proximity to the core and when Sansotei has a lineup. Decided to combo it up with Spicy miso ramen (always thin noodle, less salt soup base). In the combo, you get a choice of side rice dish, with choice of salmon roe, negi meshi, simmered pork or grilled salmon. These will usually put me over my stomach limit...  Soup base has always been flavourful, rich and very warming after a long day, or in my case, while nursing a hangover. I love getting the Hanjuku tamago and mixing the yolk and noodle together and sometimes dream of the creaminess. Expect to spend anywhere from $13-$20 for your ramen meal.   Haven't ordered any of the drinks but Santouka will always be a choice for me."}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic ramen shop just past yonge/dundas. This little shop sure is mighty - the lines will wrap around the whole thing, even in Winter. Is the hype worth it? I gotta say.. it definitely is.  This place is the most authentic ramen spot probably ever to hit Toronto. They don't have many options in ramen, but just go with one of the choices and you won't regret it. Sure, it's a smaller portion with lesser quantity of toppings, meat etc. But damn son, the quality is through the roof. The pork belly is delectable, fatty but not too much- just the right amount to melt in your mouth. That's coming from someone who doesn't like eating pork too. The ramen only comes in the 'thin' option and while I like to opt for thicccccc ones at other ramen shops, the texture in the noodles really does the trick for me. It has that fresh pulled 'bounce', ja feel? Yoooo you gotta get the chashu spicy miso ramen. Damn. Just F@#$ me up fam.  The seats are close together but they also offer you a small basket to keep any clothes, bags beside your table so you don't have to hang it around your chair, hold it etc. Service is also very quick - they are legit wearing kiminos, smiling all the time etc."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it. Despite the 20 minute wait on a cold Saturday evening, the line moved quickly and we were promptly seated.  Our server was very nice and attentive and really wanted us to get the best out of our meal for the short time we were seated. I had the Shoyu ramen which absolutely warmed me up. The noodles were enjoyable as well as the pork, green onions, and the hint of fish.   For anyone reading reviews on whether or not to check this place out, quit reading the reviews and go already! You'll really appreciate it, even if you go by yourself! They have tables for groups, but if you'd like to go by yourself, you can sit by the counter and watch the skilled chefs prepare your meal right in front of you. The decorations make the place look really nice, and it feels absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"My favourite is the spicy ramen noodles!  We have been back a couple of times and there is usually a lineup, even outside of the traditional times for lunch or dinner. It is always worth the wait.   The restaurant is small and compact once inside, but it is not a drawback for me.  I have not found another ramen restaurant that can match the outstanding flavour of Hokkaido Ramen Santouka."}
{"text":"Just landed in Toronto from LA and we where craving hot spicy soup on our first chilly night. We came across this place, thanks to all the great review. We stop our choice on the Tokusen toroniku ramen. Amazing broth! Sooooo good! Sooooo satisfying!  Very busy place, which I always see as a great sign. Waiting time are reasonable. Service is quick, efficient and it's fun to see staff welcoming you with huge smiles! I love details like those little basket by the table for bags and purses. The whole experience was amazing!  I would recommend to anyone! We'll be back Hokkaido!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit conflicted at this place. On one hand I wasn't exactly loving my meal when I had it at the time but when I look back at it, it was a pretty decent bowl of warm slurpy noodle soup goodness.  To my surprise we managed to get a seat on a Friday evening without even waiting, has the hype died down that much here? We went with their kara miso ramen (spicy) and a bowl of tsukemen for variety and both were definitely priced higher than I would have liked. Were they a good bowls of ramen? Yes, it's overly authentic and there's quality here just like what they have in Japan but considering the lack of proteins and portions here, it's hard to justify spending $40 on two bowls of ramen. That being said the broth here was incredibly rich and delightful. It has got meaty tones, it's thick, and it's powerful. It warms up your soul but I found the normal salt level overwhelming so I'd recommend asking for less salt for a much more pleasant and palatable experience. The noodles were also pretty good here and were perfectly al-dente."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Toronto so far, broth, noodle and chasu are perfectly done. Tried the kara miso, shoyu and the cold ramen dipped in kara shoyu. All taste great :) This is my go to place for ramen in town"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night with a friend around 8pm, the place does get a line around dinner time and regular wait time is probably 15-20 minutes. The place is clean, the servers were friendly, and there's not much space between tables though that's what I'd expect in a ramen joint. In Japan, there're even standing shops. The washroom is downstairs and it was well stocked.  I ordered miso ramen with seasoned egg and shared an order of gyoza. The broth was quality, very miso-ey and the egg noodles were cooked well, not mooshy. For the egg, I would have preferred it to be more runny but it was still good. As long as it's not hard egg yolk then it'll do.  All in all, I am a fan of this place and I will go back to it. Tip though is to not come during peak hours, I would probably find it more peaceful."}
{"text":"Love the soup, love the ramen, LOVE the pork cheek.  Best ramen place in Toronto."}
{"text":"I was super excited about trying this place out based on all the hype.    I had gyoza and a small pork soup.  It was delicious.    The menu is rather limited (imho), and kinda pricey for what you get.  The place was packed though and the service was friendly and efficient.  Overal, I'm happy I checked this place out, but it's not somewhere I feel compelled to return to over and over again."}
{"text":"I've tried santouka ramen before in Singapore and the portions were huge and the price relatively reasonable and I was sad to find out it wasn't the case in toronto. The wait times are long, the portions are small, the price is high and everything seems to be very salty (but that might just have been the tsukemen).   I am a big fan of tsukemen (where you dunk the noodles in your soup) and I was eager to try the one from santouka. I found the dipping soup to be overly salty (even for a tsukemen), the price a little bit steep for a ramen joint and the lack of toppings (bamboo shoots, meat, etc) disappointing.   With the amount of ramen joints in Toronto now, I don't really see the appeal of Santouka."}
{"text":"This was only my second time eating ramen and my frame of reference is very limited (and therefore my review will be fairly limited).   With that said, this place was great! I tried the spicy miso ramen, which was delicious and filling. As someone who is new to the scene, its hard to judge the quality of the food, but I will say that I will be coming back again. Oh so delicious. The service was quick and staff was friendly. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"It is a really nice Ramen restaurant operated by Japanese attendants and cooks. The soup is decently thick and the ingredients are fresh."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Small and unassuming, focused on delicious food. We had the combos which includes a bowl of rice and a bowl of ramen, with gyoza to start. Waaaayyyyyy too much food! But with one drink each and a shared dessert our bill was still only about $70. Not bad for a date night! There is a constant line up, even on a Wednesday night, but it moves quickly and we were seated within 15 minutes."}
{"text":"The food was ok but very salty. The service was just terrible. A group of us went for lunch and 1 friend came late but they didn't allow them to sit with us. So my ONE friend has to sit alone because it it was their house policy."}
{"text":"With the original in Vancouver being so busy and abrupt, it was a welcome change at the Toronto location. Service was prompt but friendly. Had the Kara miso ramen with the flavored egg. Everything was delicious and the portion was perfect. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of the many ramen places to choose from in downtown Toronto!  Santouka, the first time I came here, I was not impressed at all because of how oily and salty the soup base was, but after coming here again almost 6 months later and comparing with sansotei, kenzo and kinton, I have to say, I was pretty happy with the ramen i consumed.  I came here on a Monday and they have Gyoza special, which means as long as you purchase a ramen, they will give you 3 gyozas for free!! Pretty good deal!!  I personally prefer lighter soup base, so I went with the Shio (Salt flavour) Ramen with extra ramen for an additional dollar.  I also requested the ramen texture to be harder (cook it less) and ask for less lard (less oil) in the soup.  The ramen came out perfect, flavour was just right for me and the noodle was very chewy!  If you are in the downtown area, feeling for some ramen but do not know where to go , Santouka can be a good option!"}
{"text":"It really gave me a feel of Japan. The ramen in general is great and plus points because they're handmade. Really big servings, do not be fooled by the bowl!"}
{"text":"Good ramen but not worth lining up for it. This place is one of the most popular ramen places in Toronto, and I can see why.  Solid food, friendly service, reasonable price, and convenient location.  BUT not worth lining up for it. Nothing special about their food or atmosphere.  Tables are crammed much too close together. Small portion compared to other ramen places.  Overall, if there is no lineup, go for it! If you have to wait for more than 10min...forget about it."}
{"text":"Great dish for a chilly day.  Had the spicy ramen which was amazing.  I'm pretty new to Ramen but this place seems to be one of the best from all the reviews."}
{"text":"Not bad ramen with extremely friendly service. I just wish the place was a bit tad larger."}
{"text":"Best ramen in the city! Miso ramen is my go-to on a cold winter day. The service is extremely quick and the ramen is out of this world with flavour. As with all the good ramen restaurants in Toronto, there's usually a line outside but if you go early like 11am when they open, its less busy."}
{"text":"Food is always good here. Broth a little bit on the salty side I would prefer less salt and larger portion for the money compare to other ramen places."}
{"text":"-1 Price vs portion: I am not full! +2 Taste and food presentation: Typical nice ramen taste and presentation + 1 Well designed and comfortable place to eat -1 Wow! Nothing separates it from a typical Ramen place"}
{"text":"While I enjoyed the full pork bone flavour, the broth was definitely on the greasier side. It's just hard to justify for the price point given the ramen competition in Toronto these days. $14/bowl for 2 small pieces of meat while most toppings are extra.  I liked the spicy miso the best. I've tried their van location too and I must say the space is more comfy at this location.  Just be mindful your whole party has to be present in order to be seated. And there's not much room to wait inside so make sure to bundle up if bc you'll be outside for a while!"}
{"text":"I've eaten in quite a number of ramen restaurants and I've had a very pleasant experience at Santouka. I got the Shoyu Ramen at the regular size. They have small sizes for people who prefer a smaller portion at a reduced price (1 dollar cheaper).   The ramen came at a very prompt pace. The ramen was very chewy and the soup had a rich pork bone flavour. I really liked the pork slices that are with it. The only thing I didn't like was the salty after taste, they probably put a lot of salt in it, but overall I really enjoyed the ramen. I will come back for sure for another bowl."}
{"text":"Seems like their ramen broth is getting saltier each time, maybe that's how it's supposed to be?"}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????ok,?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick dinner around 6, surprisingly the wait wasn't that long. After we got seated, the waiter came to take our order pretty quickly. We waited for around 5 mins then received our order.   I got the dipping ramen and my bf got the kara miso ramen. They tasted pretty good, my dipping ramen was really flavorful,wasn't too salty in my opinion. I also liked the noodle that they use, it was really chewy. The Kara spicy miso ramen was a bit spicy for me, but it was normal for my bf. Comparing to ramen I had in Japan before, this place isn't bad at all. The only downside about this place is u can't just order more noodle like other places, you'll have to order another bowl..."}
{"text":"I like it! I love how they make their broth! And the staff is super friendly.   I would go back if am around the area."}
{"text":"I loooove the service, they were so kind and really nice. The broth was really nice, unfortunately noodles were not all that. The rest of the cooked food was really tasty. I feel so bad about the noodles, I have tried better ones. But the service is amazing"}
{"text":"Love their ramen! I been most of ramen place in downtown Toronto and this is the one of best so far. I been here twice and more i go, more I like their food. Broth is full of flavour and pork will melt in your mouth. Only comment I will like to make about their food is noodle. I am not a big fan of their dried noodle. It just kill their beautiful silky broth and toppings. Also portion isn't so big so if you are a big guy, make sure to order side dishes or combo.  Place is cute and food is fantastic however customer service doesn't keep up with the quality of their food & price they are asking for you to pay. Price is quite high for ramen so I am expecting to have a certain level of customer service but it did not happen every time I visit. Every time I go, I always get upset with the quality of the service. Servers are polite but quite rude at the same time. They will be quite rude to you until you been seated. So don't even bother talk or ask them about anything till you got your seat. Also service is very slow as well. I am not talking about food here. We asked water for 5 times but they didn't even serve my group water, took 10 mins to serve drinks and took 20 mins to get clean spoon for one of my friend after asking 4 times. (We were very patience as well.) It was absolutely unacceptable.  I might go back if I really miss their ramen but won't go there for long time. I will rather just go to Kinton (love their noodle and way better service than these guys).  So for the food I will give full 2.5/2.5 stars but for service, I will give 0.5/2.5 for being polite so total 3.5/5 stars."}
{"text":"A tip for those who want in, come before 6p. I got here just before 6p and there was a small lineup out front, basically two or three tables of three/four people. But here comes the problem, the door is so small that really you can't go in and put your name down or anything. And nobody comes out to take numbers. This was on top of fact I can see several tables of two just empty, when my group of two was hungry for ramen. I think they could improve on this logistical issue.  Aside from that, once we got to talk to somebody, we were seated and chose our noodles.  The \"first come first serve\" ramen with pork jowl on a separate plate was lots of meat. I think it's worth the $15.99 as there is quite a bit of meat on that dish.  The Shio ramen had two slices of pork, decent enough for $10.99.  What I liked about this ramen was the texture of the ramen. It had this feeling like it was elastic-y. The broth was plenty murky and tasty, lots of flavor.  What I would have preferred was a different type of noodle, but I mean it's not a big deal. I also wish they had an egg in the ramen, I love the soft boiled eggs and if I knew first they did not have one, I would have just ordered one on the side.  The waitresses, they were nice and attentive but not over bearing. Refilled water a lot, you need water when eating ramen.   For ramen, a good price point and a good bowl that will fill you."}
{"text":"Not in Sync with Tampopo... I really want to like this restaurant.  I really do.  The staff are so friendly, the decor is funky and I like Santouka's other locations in California. After 2 visits, I conclude that it does not stack up to the Santouka brand nor even the other locals like Sansotei. My first visit: had the Shio Ramen.   My second visit: had the Toroniku Shio Ramen. Noodles were rough, lacking elasticity.  May have been instant noodles. Having the Shio stock I wanted the original clean taste without the heavy pork etc.  Instead the stock was not delicate but cloudy and greasy. The Pork Jowls in the Toroniku were the most choice cut.  Unfortunately, it was over-salted and stale. Overall, I am saddened and was hoping to find another favorite place for quick meals."}
{"text":"Straight from northern Japan, the Santouka chain has cashed in on Toronto's ramen craze (where it seems like a new ramen house opens every week), by opening a location on Dundas, just a tad east of Yonge.  The place has a reputation for its long lineups to get in. Luckily for me, there was none when we entered early in the lunch period on a Sunday. We just walked in right when a family was done and leaving.  The noodle dishes come in small portions, and sans boiled egg (which apparently is a charged extra). The broth is savoury, but very salty. So unfilling this puny bowl before me, that I had to order not one, but two sets of gyoza to get my tummy to shut up. It was also small--which seems to be a defining theme of this restaurant--and very juicy.  Santouka is quite small for a restaurant. It is housed in a location that previously hosted a rundown greasy spoon joint I would pass by a lot in my Ryerson days. They took over the whole building, got rid of the second floor and converted its joists into a decorative overhead feature. That decision might make the place seem bigger, but deprives it of additional service space that could be used for, I dunno, seating additional patrons so I don't have to hear about the lineups!  For the size of the meals they serve, and the prices they charge for them, what an overrated ripoff. Santouka does not even come close to blowing my mind like some of the other ramen joints in town. It is a place more suited for moneyed yuppies than Ryerson students, despite the proximity to campus.  {TTC: 505 streetcar @ Victoria or Church, or just walk your lazy ass east from Dundas station.}"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good... the soup base is delish to a point I don't know what to say... I've been to hokkaido,japan and it's very very close to the it...   At 9:45pm in the evening and there is still a lineup which lasted 20mins better than a 2 hr wait at 7:30pm..my girlfriend and I decided to check out the Christmas market prior to santouka and it was a smart choice...the noddles was jus ok.. but the pork broth was really tasty... marinated egg cook to perfection...   Santouka.. you deserve every dollar of mine... the only thing which I think is not so smart is that there are empty tables but they don't allow the ppl in the back go first even if you have less guests... they make you wait in order even though there are empty tables...that's probably why there is such a huge lineup...   I will be back no doubt!"}
{"text":"The ramen craze in Toronto has finally peaked as we have seen an influx of up to a dozen ramen only speciality restaurants open its doors in the last year alone.  Diners with their insatiable appetite for that authentic ramen experience should look no further than Hokkaido Santouka Ramen.    According to their website, the restaurant chain of Santouka originated from Hokkaido, a distinct region in Japan known for their method of cooking ramen that separates itself from all other methods of cooking ramen.  Very few people will actually learn about this, for the average joe like you and I - all we're looking for is good ramen at a reasonable price.  Like all the new ramen joints in town, this place is located in the heart of downtown Toronto, about a block east of Yonge/Dundas, immediately south in the vicinity of Ryerson University. And like all the new ramen joints in downtown, there is the proverbial line up which in my opinion is a free marketing tool as curious onlookers gaze at the legion of diners standing outside, eagerly waiting for their turn to sip that delicious bowl of ramen broth.  I've been to Santouka about 8-9 times now in the last 5 months alone. I recall the line up moving quite fast compared to another well known ramen joint on Baldwin street. On average, the longest wait was 20 minutes during a late dinner rush and the shortest was 5 minutes, but that was within 45 minutes of their closing time.  It certainly helps their establishment has a bigger seating arrangement than most ramen joints.  During regular dinner rush hours, the waiting time goes up to 30-50 minutes wait, with bigger parties waiting as long as an hour.    Onto the food.  Santouka offers the usual variety of ramen such as shoyu, miso, shio ramen.  There are your typical add-ons such as nori seaweed, sweet corn, poached runny egg, extra pork and even extra bamboo shoots.  They do charge between $1-$2 for these extras and coupled with the higher cost of a bowl of ramen when compared to other joints, it certainly adds up.  A bowl here costs about $12-$15 depending on what you get.  I always get either the kara miso ramen (think spicy miso ramen) or the shoyu ramen.  I like my runny eggs and the add-on of $1.50 is a must.  There are also combos for $4-$6 more that adds a bowl of rice with pork, or salmon roe to compliment your soupy ramen.  The first bite into the noodles here will certainly bring about a sense of comfort that most people long for but seldom fine.  The ramen here is especially tasty during a cold winter's night, most probably because your senses are dulled by the winter cold and thus the warm noodles revives you like a defibrillator after you have flatlined!    The soup is creamy and fresh, filled with a flavor that is obviously pork soup based. The spicy ramen broth not overpowering in hot flavor nor is it underwhelming.  It would certainly not require the average person to find solace in a cup of cold water to cool down their taste buds.  It is always a particular enjoyment of mine to sit by the bar where one can peer into the open kitchen to see the 7 or 8 vats of broth while the kitchen workers scurry about preparing fresh deliciousness!   Their attention to detail is awesome and one can see why the ramen here is top notch with each stroke of preparation an art in itself. It's obvious that these guys are seasoned pros and you can certainly taste it in the bowl.  When you enjoy your delicious ramen, you'll find that the balance of flavors are perfect.  The pork is tender and bursting with flavor as you bite into it, the noodles are cooked perfectly and provides a balance between the soft pork belly and semi-chewy noodles.  Take a gulp of the soup to infuse with additional flavor!  It's everything that ramen should be, at least to me anyway.  As you near the bottom of your bowl of ramen, the soup will taste salty as the seasoning that they use will tend to settle down - you can however, ask for less salt as to give your tastebuds a break from the heavy onslaught of sodium.  The staff are very friendly and courteous so a 15% tip or higher is a must, even mandatory even!  They warmly greet you with a smile at the door as they show you to your seat!  With the time that has now passed since it's inception a year or so ago, diners will find the lineups have died down, the hype has vanished but alas, royal ramen lovers still flock to this noodle house to satisfy one of the city's most beautiful ramen joints.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Having had Sansotei several times, I decided to try out Santouka and compare the two.   My first experience was before I even sat down. If you come with a group, Santouka won't sit you unless your entire party is present. This can be quite bothersome because if other party members happen to be late for whatever reasons you'll be left standing just inside the doorway until everyone gets here.   The noodles were good but I prefer Sansotei's because I feel theirs had more volume and depth.  However, Santouka had a larger variety of flavours and their soup was lighter. Only downside was the greater dose of MSG used and as someone who doesn't like MSG at all, it's a sad realization.   Final point is the size and cost. Santouka is a bit more expensive for a slightly smaller size. In an overall comparison of depth of flavour and portioning, I don't think the ramen here comes in a better value than at Sansotei. Regardless, the food here is still delicious and would definitely make a great second option for ramen in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is now my official  favourite ramen place in Toronto. Their broth is so flavourable and creamy, and the consistency of their noodles is perfect. I ordered the pork jowls ramen and it was melt-in-the-mouth good.   My first experience with Santouka was in Vancouver and I fell in love with this place.  I only wish they had a few more side dishes on their menu to complement the meal.  I also wish their standard order came with a bit more toppings.   Santouka rocks and beats all the other ramen places in town hands down."}
{"text":"I went back to try this place again and this time it was much better. There's still a line up at all hours of the day (I went at 3pm on a Sunday). But this time the wait was worth it. I got the combo with the shio ramen and salmon roe bowl and a large Asahi. The ramen was delicious and the pork out of this world. I asked for less salt this time, which wasn't actually necessary as the salt was appropriate this time around (my partner's bowl was normal salt and it was totally fine). I enjoyed the sour plum on top and there is chili and black/white pepper on the side if you want to spice up your ramen.  My only complaint is the price. At $13 minimum, it's more than the other places. I'll come back once in awhile when I want a delicious bowl of ramen near the Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"Great for a later night meal/snack. I am not usually an adventurous eater but the pork in the soup with all its fat really is worth eating! It will fill you up. Service is great and efficient! Don't plan to stay all night though, it's happening, jumping and you can be in and out in 28 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb dot com! There ramen is so on point. The broth is beautiful so smooth and rich, the noodles Have juuust enough chew to keep your Mouth entertained and your jaw something to do. Not just Mushy noodle slurping up from your bowl. I love it and my friends love it and we keep going back from more, Our Ramen go to spot hands down!    Also the staff are great :)"}
{"text":"Amazing ramen in the hood! I loved their spicy miso and the broth was souper amazing with their bone broth that has been cooked for days!  Thank Goodness I did not have to wait in line for a long time and I really felt like I was eating in Japan! Staff was friendly and quick service!"}
{"text":"This Ramen place is not a place I would like to return. The portions are pretty small, contains mainly noodles and I think is overrated. In my opinion there are much much better places for ramen."}
{"text":"We were here the other night...standing the in rain...and there was still a line up. We ordered a combo that had both ramen and rice ~ probably a bit too much for one person, but I really really really wanted to make the most of standing in line!  It was delish.  Not sure what the best time would be to come to avoid a line up.  It was super authentic though.  I'll be back.  I ordered the shoyu ramen, and salmon roe on rice...both were tasty, but i think i'll try to the miso ramen next time."}
{"text":"If you want amazing Ramen and do not mind lining up outside (on weekends, the line can be a block long) then come here. All Torontonians should try this joint at least once!"}
{"text":"Santouka presents their food in a very aesthetically pleasing manner and they have a nice variety, but their ramen lacks any deep intense flavour that you would expect from a really great bowl of ramen.   I mean overall it is not bad, it's definitely better than Kinton's, but I prefer Sansotei over Santouka."}
{"text":"*slurp slurp slurp* Aahhh~  I love the pork soup base. It's very tasty even without the soya sauce or the miso or the hot sauce. I haven't tried it yet with the miso or the soya sauce.  I ordered the combo which comes with rice, I chose the salmon roe, plus I asked for the \"large\". Portion is good. I was quite stuffed after.  The pork is fattier than other places that I've been to, but I love pork belly, so that's up to discretion to individuals. Not much vegetables.  I was disappointed that you had to pay extra for green tea, otherwise, pretty good. The line-up was a bit crazy. I went on a Saturday at 3 p.m. and there was about 10 tables before me. Lucky for me I had good company, so the time flew right by.  I would give it 3.5 stars. Service was good. Food was good, but for the value, it's ok."}
{"text":"I was craving some ramen and was about to head over to Momofuku Noodle Bar, but then I remembered that there was this ramen joint not too far from where I live. I decided to check it out.  I was very satisfied with my decision! The ramen at Santouka is delicious! Incredibly flavorful. I had the spicy miso ramen, which had a perfect combination of spicy and salty flavor profiles. The prices are reasonable too ($11 for a bowl of ramen). If you do eat here, make sure you add a soft boiled egg to your order, as it adds a lot of flavor to the dish. I will definitely be going back to Santouka in the future!"}
{"text":"love the place the ramen is awesome.... small place so you need to come early cause.the line up is unreal...."}
{"text":"dropped in to warm up with a late lunch bowl of warm noodles. staff were very nice and attentive. the noodles were very good but the broth was the star . . . delicious!  two more days in Toronto, I hope to visit again for another bowl."}
{"text":"I love their Tsukemen (Dipping noodles)! I personally love Tsukemen over ramen, but it's so rare to find Tsukemen in Toronto.... but their Tsukemen was very authentic!  The second time I went though, they might have changed their recipe..... The tsukemen didn't taste as phenomenal as the first time I tried, but still delicious.   The price is a little high, but I think it's worth the Tsukemen that is so rarely found in other stores in Toronto."}
{"text":"Have tried their miso and kara ramen, very good. Servings were a decent size, you could up or down a size for only a dollar. The free gyoza on mondays were good too. The foyer is very small, but seating didn't take very long."}
{"text":"I've tried several ramen here including Kara and the Kara tsuku men. I generally Iike their ramen. However I was disappointed in the tsuke men. I expected it to be spicy since I got the Kara version but it wasn't spicy at all. Plus it wasn't as flavorful as I thought. But other than that, their other ramen are decent.   Their service is also slow. The servers barely check up on you to refill water. This is the main reason why I couldn't give them a higher ranking. They are also slow in cleaning up tables. Several times when I visited, there was a line up and there are tons of tables that are not utilized because they didn't clean them up to seat new customers. I think they got to fix their customer service."}
{"text":"One of the better ramen places I've been to.  Soup is not overly salty, meat is tender, and the noodles are just right (not too hard, not too soft).  There is a minimum order charge and the food here is on the pricier end.  It's also extra for an onsen egg."}
{"text":"Good ramen can be find at other placeslol they took my chair away and among me sitting at a cornor - worst lunch ever for sure - maybe if you are the \"alone eater\" go there , no room for sharing with friends at all"}
{"text":"I always tell people that ramen is a pretty personal dish - meaning, each person has their own preferences for what constitutes good ramen. Some people prefer the noodles to be more chewy, some prefer a more egg-y flavour, some like a flavourful broth and some prefer it light. It's hard for everyone to agree on what's the best ramen shop in the world - my personal favourite is Sansotei, but Santouka is not a bad choice either.  I love ramen but I find that I can only eat so much of it before I get tired of the taste. Ramen tends to be a bit too salty for me so after a bowl of it I get enough of the taste and often crave something else to offset the salt - usually it's gyoza but my personal preference is a rice dish, and this is Santouka's advantage over many other ramen shops nearby.  You can order a combo of ramen and a rice dish (I recommend the salmon), and the rice helps offset the saltiness of the ramen. The two together in my opinion makes a much better meal overall than just the ramen itself. I also find that I need about 1.5 ramen to feel satiated (don't judge) so the rice usually hits the spot. I do not recommend getting the karameshi though, I did not like it at all. The rest were alright but salmon is definitely #1.  Now of course because this is a ramen shop, their ramen has to be given more weight in the review. I think for me, the broth is a little too salty. Yes, I know Shio ramen in the picture literally translates to salt ramen, but I've tried all their broth flavours and they've all been consistently salty. If you like stronger flavours, then this ramen joint should be perfect for you. Other than that though, everything else is pretty spot on.  I usually drop by during off-hours but I was craving ramen so badly I came on a Saturday night. I had to wait in a fairly long line but the line moves quicker than you'd expect because ramen really doesn't take long to eat. The service was quick and efficient and they get the job done well. The seating arrangement also doesn't feel crowded even though they do try and squeeze a lot of people in.  My one minor critique in terms of service is that they should have the condiments labeled. That red sauce they give you with the gyoza is not vinegar, it's chilli oil. It's impossible to tell from just looking at the bottle.  Overall, this is a pretty decent ramen joint that you'd probably be happy with. There's a lot of competition nearby, but in my view they still stand near the top from the rest."}
{"text":"I was a bit surprised at how small the place was, considering how popular their ramen is, but the wait was pretty short despite the line. The menu was pretty straightforward; I opted for the shio ramen, and there were a few other different broths. You also have the option of adding more pork, or combining the ramen bowl with a small rice. The shio ramen was so warm and tasty, and the noodles were soft.   Also got the salmon over rice, which was a nice addition."}
{"text":"I love their food! I usually get the Miso Ramen combo with the Salmon Roe. Combo number 21! I leave this place full and always satisfied with the food and service they provide."}
{"text":"A great dive for ramen in Toronto - Came here in a group of 5 and was not disappointed. Ordered the Toroniku Shio for about $18 with tax. Definitely pretty pricey, though keep in mind that there are more affordable options ($10-$13 for regular ramen). Service is quick, and staff are nice.   It's a small place, so not great for groups. Toronto is a gem for ramen spots, so be sure to check out other places in the area (this is my first)."}
{"text":"I have been to Japan and have had great Ramen and the like so I have a sort of scale to base all other Ramen off of which can be good or bad depending on how you view things.   Anyway lets jump in, I had happen to be in Toronto last Saturday for work and I knew about this place having passed by it many times throughout my wondering of the city. Though I never had the want to go in (not for any other reason other then the fact that I was never hungry to begin with) but I decided to have a meal as it was 11 in the morning and they just opened. It would have seemed that was a good decision as the second I sat down the place was packed.   I ordered Tokusen Toroniku Ramen with a side of rice as my appetite was rather large that day. Now I've had this before in a nice little ramen resturant in a back alley of Akihabara and while being really salty it was great. So back to point I got my meal after about 10 minutes which if I was in a rush is fairly fast, and indulged in the rice with meat on top a fairly standard bowl of niku rice wasn't spectacular but was pretty good. The ramen itself was not as salty as I thought it would be (changing it to suit Canadian pallets) which was nice because the broth was excellent, the meat tender everything about the meal was great.   The only reason this place is not a five star is really only the price, I hate to do this but I have to for reference the bowl of Ramen I had at that little Tokyo restaurant cost me about five yen which is equivalent to about seven or eight dollars not a big save but you got more soup for the price.    Anyway enough of my being a negative nancy, if you want great Japanese Ramen without the 13hr flight give this place a chance just don't go when they're really busy or you'll have to wait."}
{"text":"I heard some highly recommendations of this restaurant from my friend and finally tried it at springtime. Some people said the ramen was the best in Toronto but some yelpers rated it only one star. Maybe authentic food was not suitable for everyone.  I visited with two friends and ordered three different types of ramen and a cup of green tea. ----My dish spicy miso was the best of three because it was not too salty and had a full flavour of spicy and miso.  --My green tea also helped to reduce the fat of ramen pork soup.  --My friends ramen were very similar, one is original and another is soybean sauce style. The difference between them was just one added soybean sauce into the soup and both of them tasted a little greasy.  Overall, the reataurant was very good and popular. You'd better visit there early or avoid mealtime if you don't want to wait for long time."}
{"text":"After a long excursion around downtown Toronto, my friends and I decided to take a break and get some grub because we were tired and hungry! I've always wanted to give Santouka a try because people have been praising this place and giving it some good reviews.  Thank goodness that we went at a time where it wasn't super super busy, there was still a little line-up but it was pretty quick. We only had to wait about 10-15 minutes tops as opposed to an hour or lining up outside.  Upon entering, the establishment is quite small (not as small as Sansotei) since I was picturing it to be a medium-large scale sized restaurant. Despite the size, the interior-decor was absolutely stunning. Modern, sleek and has a really nice authentic Japanese-vibe. Like Guu, once you've entered the establishment, you'll have the wonderful staff greeting you loudly in Japanese and when you're leaving, they'll be sending you off with their goodbyes in Japanese as well.  Now onto the food, I ordered their Ramen Combination #22, Shoyu Ramen w/ a salmon rice bowl.  The portion was good and it definitely filled you up without over eating and feeling incredibly bloated after. The noodles were chewy and yummy but I definitely prefer Sansotei's noodles over these ones. The soup was extremely flavourful. You can definitely taste the porkyness within the pork broth. It was light and yummy at first but the saltiness and the richness of the soup will build up by the end and it will leave you thirsty for water. I don't mind that but that's bound to happen at a lot of ramen places. For the salmon rice bowl, I absolutely enjoyed the yummy sushi rice, it wasn't too sticky and it wasn't too dry, it was just right. The salmon in the rice bowl was delicious too. You can still taste the fishyness of the salmon, I don't know if it was on purpose or if they didn't cook/marinade it long enough to get rid of that lingering fishy taste but it wasn't that bad.  Overall, this newly opened ramen joint ain't that bad. Service is incredibly fast and the food is great. The vibe is awesome and very welcoming. Stop on by and give Santouka a try!"}
{"text":"Menu: https://www.santouka.co.jp/en/menu  What we had: Kara miso (spicy) cha-shu ramen, large toroniku (cheek meat) shio ramen, matcha cheesecake  Taste: 8/10  The broth here is thick and rich, though a little too salty, and the meat is tender. The kara miso ramen was flavourful and had a small spicy kick. The toroniku shio ramen was a little bland in comparison. I think there are options for making your broth less thick and less salty, and we should have asked for less salt, but hindsight is 20/20.   The cheesecake has the same consistency as a Western cheesecake; it's a lot more dense than Japanese cheesecakes. It had a lot of matcha flavour. We expected it to be more like a Japanese cheesecake. Steven liked it, Laura would have preferred a lighter cheesecake.  Value: 3/10  They give very little meat/other things that go into the ramen. You get 1 piece of meat if you don't order extra meat. Furthermore, their bowls are quite small. A large size bowl here would be the same as a regular size bowl at Sansotei. Even after ordering a \"large\" bowl with \"extra\" meat (5 slices of meat) AND sharing a slice of cheesecake, Steven was still hungry.  We forget the price breakdown of the items but...  **Average cost per diner: more than $21 After Tax+Tip (We say \"more than\" because Steven wasn't even full at the end.)  Service/Convenience: 8/10  The place is easy to locate. It could get busy here and the line sometimes extends to the outside, which really sucks in the winter. The staff here are fairly efficient and try to get you in as quickly as possible. Like most Asian restaurants, the staff don't fawn over you, but deliver what ever you need reasonably quickly.  Would go back? Maybe, but when selecting between Santouka and Sansotei, we would prefer to go to Sansotei.  Would recommend to friend? Yes, to try if they like ramen. And if they have a small stomach.  Similar places: Sansotei  **Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza (16\") in one sitting."}
{"text":"Initially my family and I were heading to Sansotei, however we forgot to call ahead, and it was closed on Labour Day. We walked a little further east and decided to checkout Santouka.   It was 9:30 pm and the little spot was packed with a line out the door. I find it cute how they have a little bar seating area, where you can watch all the action. After about a 15 minute wait, we were seated and handed out menus. I decided to go with the Shio Ramen, a white tonkotsu soup base, as stated on the menu. Wow, this was so good! Although a little more pricey at $12.45 for a regular, it definitely filled me up! The soup base was slightly salty, however it wasn't overpowering and was super creamy! My parents had the both the Spicy Miso and Miso Ramen, and enjoyed theirs as well, but said the Shio was definitely the star of the show. The tender pieces of Char Siu were flavourful and melt in your mouth and I really enjoyed the crunchy bamboo.   Not a bad place for a nice quick bowl of ramen, however it is pricier than Sansotei, and others. The staff are super friendly and sweet."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by multiple people so I had to come and visit this place to see for myself.  First of all, the parking here is all private lots, so drive around until you find parking.  Tip, the cheapest place that I found was across the street and behind the obvious lot (it's about 2 dollars cheaper).  There was a lineup when we got there, but I think we got through it in around 15 minutes.  The place isn't exactly that big, it's smaller than an average Tim Hortons.  After sitting down, I ordered the Miso ramen with extra cha shiu.  We also got an order of gyoza for the table.  The ramen is not that great.  The soup base was overly sweet and the noodles were under cooked.  For a place that specializes in ramen, I was expecting at least par, not a triple bogey.  The cha shiu was decent, but it wasn't grilled like Kinton does it.  It was average, but at least it was pretty tender.  One funny thing I saw while sitting down was one of the waiters pouring beer.  I don't really hold this against the review, but I found it kind of odd.  The waiter poured the beer, but to get rid of the extra head on the beer, he used a ramen spoon to scoop it out.  Not exactly what you want to see (maybe he just didn't know how to pour beer).  What really got me is the price of this place.  You're looking at 12-14 dollars for ramen, that's outrageous.  The fact that it wasn't that good floored me even more.  I don't think I'd ever come back, there's plenty of better ramen places around that are close by."}
{"text":"Had this when I was in Vancouver, so I had to try it in Toronto as well.  Ramen is good, though I've had better.  Service was superb too.  Had the Toroniku Shio and it was literally melt in the mouth deliciousness.  I wouldn't settle for any other chashu.  Worth a try if you're in the area and if there isn't a huge line up."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I quite like this place. The soup base was creamy like others said but i didn't find it too fatty. Maybe if u just scrap off the top layer it is, but you're not really supposed to. I did find myself feeling thirsty after but I didn't find the soup base that salty. We came at around 5:30 on a sat and there was no line up. staff was friendly and the food came really fast. The price was high compared to other ramen places and the bowls were smaller. The cha su wasn't that special, but the pork cheek was good. Will come back if in the area but probably would not line up for it."}
{"text":"Japanese-style noodles in a medium or large bowl. Very fast waiter/food service when I went at 11pm. Dim indoor lighting. Full window view of the street. Basic meal is around $15."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of various ramen places downtown. Was going to go try Sansotei Ramen but their place was being renovated.   Using Yelp, we searched for the next, & came across Santouka. We followed the map to track the place down! It wasn't in a great area, but the restaurant was very small dainty & posh. Window front, they had the fake bowls of sample noodles with wooden pillars near the window sill.  Big Calligraphy Of their Asian Name on the door. There was no line up at the time of 11am. We were seated shortly after.   I ordered the melon cream soda. The green melon soda was the bottom and a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  It was delicious, the soda itself was really refreshing, when the ice cream was mixed in, it was a creamy glass of carbonated yumminess!!!   For my ramen I ordered the Tokusen Toroniku Ramen. It was an expensive one, around $18 something. It was their signature ramen with their special broth & melt in your mouth pork jowl meat, which came on a separate plate. The broth was very flavorful and the noodles was a nice chew & it was piping hot. Portion was also the right side for me.   My husband ordered the Sparkling Peach Jelly Sake. Which came in a can, the waitress said we needed to shake it 10 times before opening it. I guess to distribute the jelly even. I don't think we shook it hard enough, cause at the end there was a big blob of jelly oozing out of the can. Lol! Taste was also quite nice & refreshing.  His Miso Ramen was a Large and they were not stingy with the meat. At least 4 slices of pork and the sides. Broth was also very nice in flavour!   I also had the chance to check out their washroom. There wasn't any signage of where it was..but by instinct I assumed it was the stairs heading down. I went down the stairs and what a difference. Lol! It was more run down & it was just 1 toilet room for male & female. It was slightly lower ceiling than usual washrooms. And the lighting was sooooooo eerie. There was a dim Japanese lantern right next to the toilet seat, and a slight humming sound coming for it. Then I  saw a switch on the wall..thinking maybe it will turn on a brighter light..but it did nothing...so I quickly went & washed my hands & got outta there..lol!   But food was excellent and I would go back again &  service was good too."}
{"text":"I got the most popular ramen there but i forget the name ($12.45) and completely got full after i finished that and the soup base keke. I came along once but couldn't get a spot cause it was so crowded so today i cameback again and try this ramen. Highly recommend for this and nice service customer!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get here, fast. Small, local joint with some of the tastiest ramen around! I had the Kara Miso; soooooooo good. Also, I'm a massive gyoza fan, (pretty much eat them in every Japanese restaurant I go to) - these ones were fab. Lightly browned on the bottom, doughy and smooth on he top. Not at all greasy. And the filling was yummmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"It's my second visit to this place. This time for their 5 year anniversary. It is a small establishment with a seating of about 30. Both times I've been here, there was a long lineup. I ordered the Kara Miso Ramen, while my friends ordered Shio and Shoyu ramen. They said their ramen were not as flavorful as the Kara Miso. Service was attentive. Noodles was decent."}
{"text":"Stop reading this review and simply GO to Santouka.  Get the keys, walk to the car and drive.    Parking is easy, there is a surface lot right NEXT to the building; expect to pay $10C on the weekends.  Expect to wait in line for about 20 to 30 minutes.  Don't expect to bring a large group of friends; 4 is fine, 6 is pushing it.  This place is small and the wait staff speaks Japanese; English is NOT the primary language (expect to order by pointing).    Now, bad on my part for not remembering the name of the items that I ordered (FAIL!!!), but all I can say is that is was AMAZING.  Did I say, A-MAZING?!?!?!  I ordered a combo ramen bowl of noodles (in spicy soup), with a side of rice/tofu/pork.    The noodles were fresh made, the broth was tasty yet delicate, the pork was extra fatty and the side dish was amazing.  I had a few gyoza as well; delicious!!!  There isn't much else to say, but simply what I said at the very beginning of this Yelp review :-)"}
{"text":"Discovered this place on a whim.  Never had ramen before.  Dreams came true that night.  Visited other ramen places since, and nothing compares.  Best ramen in all of Toronto :|.  I try to visit here at least once a month. #bonerforramen"}
{"text":"Meh. Meh is what I can say about this place. Honestly I'm not a ramen snob and perhaps my standards were a tad bit high considering all the rave I heard/read about this place. But I definitely expected it to be significantly better than it was. I came recently and got the miso ramen and my boyfriend got the shoyu ramen. The ramen was quick, we got our food within 5 minutes. It was also nice and hot (temperature wise), just the way I like it. The portions were definitely much smaller than we expected, I don't normally eat a lot but I was able to finish my ramen quick easily and probably should have opted for the larger size (+/- $1 for size). Also can we take about how little pork was actually in the soup?? Legit, we each had two small pieces of pork in our soup which was quite disappointing. I can't complain about the soup base - it was delicious and definitely better than Santosei's.  For the record, Ajisen Ramen still remains my fave go-to ramen place in Toronto :)"}
{"text":"This is a very small place and this results in extremely long wait times. The food though, is worth the wait.  I haven't had ramen this fresh and delicious. They have a lot of options and it is not expensive either."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday around 7 and there actually was no lineup. Tried the Shio ramen. They gave alot of noodles. But need to get extra meat or won't be satisfied. It wasn't too salty and the noodles were just how I like them soft, chewy and abundant.  Overall actually enjoyed Sansotei broths better but Santouka is very good."}
{"text":"Ramen is pretty good, but there are definitely some better places in Toronto. Service is okay and they also don't have any veggie options. Would recommend for a quick, easy meal, but that's pretty much it."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday with two co-workers at around 12:00 - no wait time for a table, which was a pleasant surprise, especially given the hype that surrounds this restaurant.  Opted for the staple Shio ramen with pork jowl, along with an egg (a must if you're coming to Santouka).  Though the ramen dish was simple, the flavour really hit home. The broth was fantastic, the pork was incredibly tender, the egg was flawless - overall, Santouka is home to a very solid ramen experience."}
{"text":"Overall:4 Food: 4.5 Service: 4.5 Price: 4 Atmosphere: 4  Hokkaido Ramen was a great ramen and sake experience. I had the miso ramen along with side dishes like minced pork and rice. All were really good and satisfying. The servers were really kind and attentive for any requests and while taking our orders. It's a nice experience that was complimented by the wonderful treatment my friend and I received.   The sake came with a square drinking cup, I hope so, which was my first time trying it from a square cup over a traditional one. The atmosphere was quaint and warm. A great spot for friends to catch up. The price was a little over 22+ in CAD. Overall, I would come again and try another dish."}
{"text":"So, my first experience with real ramen was two years ago in Nagoya, Japan.  It left me forever changed.  I had no idea ramen could be so wonderful.  As luck would have it, I was in Canada on business, and my coworkers told me Toronto had some good ramen places.  So I decided a leisurely visit to downtown Toronto was in order for a Sunday evening.  Upon locating a free parking lot around the corner from the restaurant, I was greeted with a line out the door.  This, I thought, was a good sign.  After waiting in line for about 30 minutes, I was finally seated, with menu in hand.    I had the shoyu ramen, with aji-tama (soft boiled egg).  When the Bowl arrived, with the egg, pork, and vegetable accompaniments, I proceeded to add everything into the bowl and let it steep in the hot broth.  I can't describe in words how delicious this all smelled, but I can tell you this - It was delicious.    If you are looking for ramen in Toronto, this is the place to go, hands down!  #ramenislife"}
{"text":"Authentic ramen at a convenient location! Came here on a Monday at 5pm and did not have to wait for a table. Santouka is a chain originating from Hokkaido so I was pretty excited to try their ramen. I ordered the Shio ramen and was not disappointed. Bouncy ramen covered in a thick broth with jelly mushrooms, green onions and bamboo shoots on top. Would come back to try their tsukemen."}
{"text":"MMMMM Umami about sums it up. Nothing like a bowl of noodles, the simple basic Shio ramen, and a side of Tokusen toroniku, Roasted pork cheeks, to make a perfect yummy meal. Full rich flavours and perfect textures.  Usually with a line up, Hokkaido Ramen is worth the wait, which attests to it's quality and value, and the hustle and bustle adds to the ambiance and fun.  I've been a few times and always ordered the same, because I craved an excellent bowl of noodles and didn't want to be surprised. Next time I visit, and there will be a next time for sure, I will stray and begin exploring the menu, as should you! If the rest of the menu is as good at the basics then they will earn my fifth star."}
{"text":"Not as many options for ramen here; the ramen is quite heavy and thick. I ordered the Salmon Rice - the salmon is kind of dry like canned salmon. Added soy sauce and some ramen soup for more flavour/better texture.  Minimum charge of $10 per person!!"}
{"text":"Ramen restaurants I find are hit and miss, and while the quality of soup and ingredients was good I'd say this one hits more on the miss side.  Taking over from an old greasy spoon breakfast place the new owners did an excellent job of redecorating and giving the outside of the place a cool facelift while keeping the structure intact. Inside is cozy and intimate, with Asian inspired interior touches throughout.   The first (and only) time I went the service was fast and friendly. The waitress spoke fractured English but was friendly and made an effort to understand through her own interpretation what my friend and I were asking for. So the service was not the reason for the two stars. The reason was purely food based. While the ingredients were tasty and as I've mentioned, good quality, the servings were so small that after I left and went home I had to make more food to make up for my hunger (ironically enough I made ramen!). My friend got a small bowl of soup (I got the largest) and she got an appetizer...I think it was shrimp rolls. According to her they were okay, not great. My soup had pork belly and mushrooms...a total of 4 small slices of pork belly and what looked like 1.5 mushrooms chopped up. The bill arrives and it was over $30! I think it was $32 and after tip (it wasn't the severs fault the soup was so unsubstantial) the bill total was $37. Maybe it's because ramen in Chinatown costs $1 at most and the ingredients for it are cheap and easy to find, but I can't in good conscience pay $37 for two bowls of soup and some rolls. At least with pho it's more complex and I can't make it so easily myself. I'm afraid I'll have to include ramen restaurants along with hot dog joints; I just can't see them lasting.   Not worth the trip"}
{"text":"we came here during the ice storm power outages...ordered one miso, one shiyo, one shoyu. i had the shoyu which is the best among these three soups.  soup - i think is too oily but it tastes good meat - is too fat. one piece was like the whole white fatty part. which i didn't even eat noodles - i think it's pretty good.  i think a good egg with runny yolk would complement the ramen so much but none of its ramen has one.  i like sansotei better."}
{"text":"My two friends and I came by around seven on Wednesday night and were immediately seated.  I ordered the cold dipped noodle, while my friends ordered one of the Ramen, and the Ramen salmon rice bowl combo.  Service was quick and the staff were attending, the food came roughly 5-10 minutes after the orders were put in.  As for the food themselves: the sides were typical (corn, butter, salad), noting exciting there. However my noodles were exceptional. It was the perfect texture (probably from the cold water bath immediately after they were cooked) and the broth was not bad.  Solid four out of five. Would definitely go back because of how well done the noodle was, especially for the price (~10 usd before tax)."}
{"text":"Pork cheek just melts in your mouth. It's insanely good.   The tonkotsu broth is also quite good. Overall, a solid bowl of ramen and up there with Kinton and Sansotei for best ramen in the city."}
{"text":"Holy Moly, all I ever crave is ramen from here. I got the Shoyu ramen and the broth was so flavourful. The pork melts in your mouth and bamboo adds texture to the whole bowl. We also ordered the gyoza which were also delicious! The place is busy; however, everyone is seated rather quickly. The service is great-- everyone is really friendly.   Side note, the ramen doesn't come with an egg so don't forget to order one!"}
{"text":"I go to this ramen place every time I come back to Toronto. They have a location in Vancouver which was the first one that I went to. Delicious broths that a rich and creamy. Overall fantastic place and I will keep coming back. This place can get very busy though and they do not seat you until your full party is here so I would recommend going right when they open or during the weekdays to avoid a long wait!"}
{"text":"Well worth the wait, this places was PACKED when I came by, even a party of one took about 15 minutes to be seated. The food is amazing and the service is very quick. My only issue was that it was hard to figure out how the seating worked. There was a waitress taking names when she wasn't running orders, but she would not take them until the party was in the very small foyer.. There was a clumpy line on the street several parties long. Some parties would jump ahead, not knowing that others behind them had yet to have their names taken and thinking they would put their names on the list and then go back to the end of the line - only to end up being seated right away.  Either way - get your name on the seating list. The turn over is very quick as customers, myself included, cannot help but inhale the tasty Ramen. I had the miso ramen and it was delicate and filling with meaty pork and plenty of noodles."}
{"text":"Holy crap! Inchiban desu! This is the beat bowl of noodles ever. Period. Not \"in Toronto\" not \"on this continent\" not \"outside of Japan.\" For the noodle soup lover, this is Mecca. The broth alone is a complex, layered, delicate construction. Add an undertone of chilies and a blatant yet restrained note of miso and you can imagine the oily, salty, savory broth Santoku puts in front of you. Cold but not dried ramen noodles are added and a plate of acutremont are served. The pork jowels are succulent and ethereal. The muscle fiber falls apart like a cherry blossom's petals. The fat melts like smooth butter. The thin layer on the outside tastes of bacon crumbs. With the green onions, sliced mushrooms and kelp, your bowl becomes a koan, your slurping a mantra. And before you leave you will reach enlightenment. Yes, tasty, precious nirvana where time stops, mind ceases, and the reality of the universe opens-up to reveal the truth that you have eaten the all time best bowl of noodle soup that ever was."}
{"text":"Ramen is one of those dishes that decievingly look easy to make The simplicity however, makes it one of the hardest dishes to get right.  The perfect ramen consists of perfecting these components: noodles, broth, meat, egg. The noodles must be the pefect temperature, cooked al dente so that it's chewy and yet not hard swimming in a broth rich in an opaque sea of umami that feels buttery in the mouth. The meat must be poached to tenderness in the perfect amount of seasoning accompanied by an egg that reveals a gooey warm yolk that melts in your mouth. Hokkaido does broth absolutely right. The Kara and the Shoyu cha is heavenly, but the grand daddy of them all -- the miso -- leaves a lot to be desired. The miso completely mutes and overwhelms the subtle flavors of the shoyu cha with a sharp saltiness that will have you guzzling down the water.  The noodles are cooked to perfection - chewy, long, absolutely pleasing to slurp. The pork is also extremely tender and oozes delicious flavors when biting into it.   So why 3 stars?  Aside from oversalting the miso ramen, the Ikuru bowl was very disappointing. The salmon roe was fishier than it should have been, indication of an older product. Texture was also goopy and lacked the bite that fresher products offer. The rice that sat below it was absolutely unseasoned. Japanese food is all about scintillating all of the taste buds and this dish absolutely missed the mark.  I will have to try this place again because the broth, meat and noodles are absolutely gorgeous but the lack of attention to detail leaves quite a bit of room for improvement."}
{"text":"By far, my favourite restaurant to get ramen!  Upon entering, the workers were very friendly and welcoming. They even asked where we wanted to be seated. The path to the washroom was a bit scary as it was down the stairs. I decided to order the Shoyu Ramen and it was presented very nicely on a uniquely shaped tray. The noodles had a very silky texture and the pork was extremely tasty. The ramen was very flavourful and not overly salty.   The portion was fairly reasonable as it wasn't too little or too much, but just enough to satisfy your hunger. It is the perfect place to go to if you're ever craving ramen."}
{"text":"Wholly disappointed. Never have I ever went to a ramen place and not finished my bowl.   The chasu was probably the best thing in the bowl. Broth? Way too salty. Bamboo shoots? Leaves a bad aftertaste. Noodles? Tastes like instant ramen. It doesn't even come with an egg!    All in all, I won't be coming again. What I ordered: Shoyu Chasu Ramen"}
{"text":"Hokkaido, es buena opción para unos ramen express, el sabor es rico, solo que el lugar pequeño y apretado!"}
{"text":"I don't think anyone can deny that this is damn good ramen. But a few days prior, I had tried another ramen joint in Toronto that blew me away with their taste and service. It kind of overshadowed my ramen experience at Santouka. Definitely good stuff, and appreciated that they were open semi-late, but if it's a choice between the two I know where I'm going!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best ramen place I've ever been. Hands down. I went there a couple days ago for a quick lunch, I must say I was very impressed. From all the reviews I read here, I made sure to arrive early. The restaurant sure filled up really fast.   First, let me talk about the service. I went to do a bit of shopping before heading down, so I had a few shopping bags in my hand. I was quickly seated, and I naturally put some shopping bags on the ground. The waitress brought me a small laundry basket thing by my chair for me to put my shopping bags, which totally surprised me. The service was ridiculously fast, and the waitress was very caring and helpful.   As for the food, I ordered #16, a spicy sort of ramen with Tonkatsu (pork), I can't recall the exact name. It was the best decision I've made. The noodles itself have just enough chewiness, the soup was not as salty as I expected and actually somewhat drinkable, the pork literally melts in my mouth. It was just amazing. We also ordered the green tea mochi for dessert, it was alright, but nothing too special.   Overall, great meal, great service. Will definitely return again."}
{"text":"Been there many times. Tasty soup with perfect amount of noodle. Especially like to egg. Must try."}
{"text":"Many people were raving about this restaurant and so I thought I'd give it a try on a really cold day.   There was no one waiting in line which was great, but it took so long for a waitress to come by and seat us (2 people). Once seated, we ordered Gyoza, Japanese pan-fried dumplings, for starters and we both ordered Toroniku Kara Miso Ramen with an egg on the side each. The toppings that are included with the ramen come on a separate plate consisting of pork jowl, bamboo shoot, jelly ear and scallions.   The gyoza and ramen were delicious and perfect for the chilly weather outside. The noodles were cooked al dente and the broth was very rich. A couple things I'd like to comment on would be that I personally didn't like the taste of the bamboo shoot because it was too pungent; secondly, although the broth was delicious it was a bit too salty for me; and finally, the price they charged was pretty expensive compared to what we've normally paid for at other ramen restaurants. I'm not sure if we'll be coming here again, but if we do I will definitely try a different soup base and see if it's less salty than the one I ordered."}
{"text":"The ramen here is very good. The experience is completely minimalist.  You wait in line to eat the ramen. You sit down and wait five minutes to be served the ramen. You slurp down the ramen. You do not linger after or even really during the meal because (especially on weekends and at peak times) there is a line of people out the door who are (mostly) patiently waiting for the ramen.  This is not the place for a get-to-know you date or to visit old friends. It is strictly for the consumption of ramen. If you do go with friends, you can talk about the ramen in detail after you leave."}
{"text":"My buddy from the states was in town and was craving some Ramen.   This place is known for its good Ramen and long line ups. Thankfully we arrived off peak and were seated within seconds.   The service was stupidly good. Smiles, thank you's and frequent (but not uncomfortable) check ins were all provided. The food arrived quick and was delicious. Broth wasn't overly salty. Pork was perfectly cooked.   My only beef to pick with this place is the price. $13+ for a soup.   Don't get me wrong, they're doing great things but I don't see how on earth they can charge $13+ dollars for a soup. It's madness. But then again what do I know - the line up is still out the door (but maybe that's why millennials cant afford to buy a house. Good but pricey for what it is.   Just my 2 cents."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, horrible service.   We were a group of five waiting for a friend to join us. We were not permitted seating since our party was not all present. We saw the sign, but there were empty tables for some time. Despite their sign at the front entrance, a table was reserved in the back for four people, with menues left on the table. After waiting for our friend and no one waiting in line behind us, we asked if we could be seated and have a drink while waiting. We were told no, despite the fact that there were other empty tables and it seemed clear the back table was reserved for a larger group. So we stood there, hungry and thirsty, with a table waiting for us. Where's the logic and more importantly, the hospitality, which is their business.   When our friend did arrive, we were seated at the table at the back but it was a table for four. There were five of us. Hungry and tired, we made due. I later asked if we could add the table next to us when the table became available. We were told yes. However, when the table did become available, it was not given to us. Instead it was put together with the table next to it... for a table of three! After reminding the staff that we were waiting for the extra table, we were told that was not possible. So the five of us were forced to squeeze into the same small space as the three beside us. Common sense would have been to give us the extra room, and put an extra chair at the other table. This was not what prevailed. There was no apology or reasoning with the person who was clearly in charge.   Things get from bad to worse: when asked to speak with the manager, we were told there was none. When I asked for a contact number or email address, it took the staff over 15 minutes to figure out what to do. Both the servers and the kitchen staff proceeded to have a meeting in the back of the restaurant, apparently trying to produce a contact number they could give me. Finally, I was told to call a number in Vancouver. No name was provided, despite my request for one. The incompetence is beyond understanding. Despite the patience my friends and I exercised, we left thoroughly unimpressed and deeply unsatisfied. Clearly, I will not be returning. Good luck if you choose to venture to this establishment. I recommend you don't come with a group larger than four. Food, well, it was not bad. Not worth the frustration or disrespect."}
{"text":"Great portions and the noodle texture is great. I still prefer Kinton. Definitely go around 11:30-11:45am to avoid waiting and they won't seat you until your while party is there."}
{"text":"FINALLY! SANTOUKA RAMEN HAS OPENED IN TORONTO! I have been waiting for so long for this ramen shop to open. When I saw in blogTO that this place opened, I HAD to go. My friends and went for the soft opening today (opened from 11 AM to 11 PM). Absolutely no line-up! Hurray!  Service was very friendly and they came by every now and then to check if we were okay. I had myself the Kara Miso (spicy miso ramen) - which was really good. What I like about Santouka was that you can choose how firm you want your noodles and you can get a smaller portion for -$1.00 or a larger portion for +$1.00. I  got myself the normal size, and it was perfect. Wasn't too heavy, wasn't too light, justtttt right (said Goldilocks).  It was only the soft opening, so I'm guessing it's going to get busier as time passes by. I was debating with my friends on which place I liked better -- Santouka or Kinton. But for some strange reason, I might have to say Santouka might be better (however, I really really really wanted a soft-boiled egg with my ramen). It might be the fact that it wasn't ultra hot in the restaurant, the food was good, and the seating arrangements were much better.  Hurray for ramen choies in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Very small ramen shop tucked in the corner of Dundas square.   I always order their pork jowls with ramen. You can't go wrong with any of their ramen selections. I've tried them all and I liked it!   This place is quite small, and you might be waiting by the entrance on weekends and Friday nights. Remember: they won't sit you unless your whole party has arrived.   This place is great from fall to spring! As the warm broth and tasty meats just enlightens your soul"}
{"text":"I've tried various ramen places around the city and I would say this one is very good, but not the best out there.  The broth is rich, creamy and flavourful, but the pork is very fatty and unless you order the double portion of meat, you don't get a lot of it.  The gyoza are however very good and we almost ordered a second serving.  The servers are very nice and attentive. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"#RAMEN #YELPTO #RAMENTORONTO #NOODLESTORONTO  Ramen after so long, and I am glad it was fantastic!   I've passed by this place and window-devoured some of their gorgeous sample bowls, so I was super excited to finally try Hokkaido Ramen Santouka. Sadly there was a wait of \"10 minutes\" that they over-promised; the wait was actually 20-25 minutes. Once you're in and have a table, things move a lot faster. 5 minutes to order and maybe another 5 for the order to make it to your table; and finally another 15 to slurp up this amazing concoction.   I ordered the basic Medium-sized, no-spice, ramen with pork. It was around $12, and sadly came with only 3 pieces of pork. I am a pho girl, so I am used to having tons of meat in my soup. The ample noodles and creamy, buttery broth, and the taste of the tender pork made up for the lack of meat.  So, summing up mine and everyone else's feedback here... this place is fairly pricey for Ramen. That said, it's the best I've had so far."}
{"text":"My first bowl of ramen ever was here last week. The noodles were delicious but I didn't really enjoy the pork belly. It was tender but so fatty. I will give it another try because Iiked everything else."}
{"text":"I came by this area for some good food and decided to give it a try since it has such positive reviews. The place is spacious, lighting isn't too dark, and the staff are generally pretty friendly. I believe it is run by Japanese staff or staff that know Japanese, as this franchise from Japan actually.   I decided to try their shoyu toroniku ramen as this is the traditional way of eating ramen, with the pork jowl served separately on a side dish. The pork jowl was amazing!!!! It literally MELTS in your mouth :) the ramen was also cooked perfectly in its texture, I love how there is a bit of spring in the noodles. The broth is actually really good. A bit salty but the flavours are great! I definitely enjoyed my bowl of ramen. I would say it's on par with sansotei ramen!  The sides that came with the pork Jowl complemented the bowl of noodles really well :) they have desserts as well- green tea cheesecake and matcha Mochi ice which is basically ice cream Mochi but I was too full to eat. The only thing is that the price is a bit more expensive (15 dollars Vs 10 dollars for the original char Siu ramen), but with the instant melt feeling it's quite worth the extra few dollars :)  Would def come back for another bowl if I'm ever in the area again!"}
{"text":"What a great way to start your weekend with a piping hot bowl of Ramen.   Many different varieties available in this quaint little Japanese bistro, nestled behind Dundas Square.   The shoyu Ramen was good, shio Ramen a bit too salty for my liking.  Tamago (egg in Japanese) is usually standard in a Ramen bowl but was an option. Food is good, service is prompt and courteous. Price is a bit steep, for two Ramen bowls and one side of pork dumplings, we paid $35 which is a bit steep.  Paid parking is available on Church street, factoring the money paid for the meal did not equate to its value."}
{"text":"I used to come for lunch all the time and loved the noodles. I had a pregnant friend visiting out of town who wanted to meet for late lunch. It was 2:30pm, restaurant was empty and they wouldn't let her be seated while I was walking over. So inconsiderate as she is obviously pregnant.  Then I wanted to only order a rice dish which was $6 and they said I needed to order more because the minimum charge is $9. I asked to speak to the manager but he kept saying the same thing over and over. I even asked if I could order a 2nd dish and take it to go but not even that was allowed. I will never go there again based on principle alone."}
{"text":"We might live in Ottawa, but Santouka is always a well-deserved stop - whenever there's one in the neighbourhood, whether that means Toronto or Vancouver. It is even worth a 15-30 minute line up in pre-freezing temperatures (0-5 degrees C) just to be able to taste well-made, authentic ramen.   It was actually with a nostalgia for good ramen that we made the trip to Toronto last weekend in the first place, and Santouka did not disappoint (it never disappoints). We did wait for about 15 minutes before being seated (this was even after the lunch rush), but it is worth it in every way. I had the Shoyu and my partner had the Cha-shu, and we both had the egg on the side with gyoza to start. Nothing like good pork broth after waiting in the cold!   As an aside - I had ramen in Ottawa not two weeks before coming to Toronto, and I must remark on how difficult it was to eat that with braces (I almost choked on their noodles). No such problems when I ate at Santouka. The whole experience lasted 20 minutes, and I really hope that will last us until our next ramen craving!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Japanese ramen restaurant in Toronto, and I always recommend it to my friends when we're looking for a place to eat near the Eaton Centre.  Environment: It's located near the Dundas/Church intersection, which means it's only about 10 mins walk away from Dundas Square and the Eaton Centre, which you know the restaurant will be packed all the time given its great location and amazing noodles.  Usually you can expect a 30mins long wait outside the restaurant if you go during meal times. The inside of the restaurant is somewhat packed and quite noisy due to the crowd. It's better that you come in a group of 4 of fewer.  Food: Honestly I think the portion sizes here are a little smaller than the other ramen restaurants nearby, and the prices to be a little more expensive, but the taste totally makes up for it. You can order different sizes of ramen too based on how much food you want to get, but for the regular size it's definitely smaller than Sansotei. I usually like the ramen with creamy soup base like the Tonkatsu ramen. Also, I would always ask for less salt as well, knowing that ramen restaurants like to splurge on the sodium. The quality of the chashu is pretty good, it's really tender and has a nice soya sauce flavour. I especially like the taste of the soup, as I find it tastes a little bit sweet which gives it more depth.   Service: The waitresses are pretty nice and they would usually say \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" to you in Japanese. However, since they mostly hire Japanese people, I find their accents to be pretty thick and sometimes they also have a hard time understanding me when I want to request for less salt in my soup. But overall, decent service."}
{"text":"Taste: 4 Presentation: 5 Value: 4 Service: 5 Overall: 4.5 rounded up to 5  Hi and welcome to today's episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. I have been told by several friends that Santouka is arguably the best ramen in Toronto. I've had very good ramen in Japan in the past so that would be hard to beat. But let's dive right into the review!  Looking at the bowl when it first comes the meats and veggies are very well aligned and presented. No complaints about anything there! The bowl looks kind of small but after starting to eat i realized they pack in a lot of noodles; I was surprised! Trying the smooth broth, it was extremely delicious. Probably the closest you can get to ramen broth in Japan. The noodles on the other hand were slightly less chewy than ones I've had in Japan and is my only complaint in this bowl.   In terms of the price, my girlfriend paid for it and didn't seem to complain, so it must be fairly priced! And for the amount of noodles I received the price is justified.  The service here is fantastic! The waiters and waitresses work really fast and are very friendly.   Overall, the ramen here has impressed me and I can confidently confirm that this is one of the best ramen restaurants in Toronto. I will definitely revisit time and time again for many years. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life."}
{"text":"So, this is the second ramen place i have tried.  I have been very curious about this place because every time i walk by in the evening there seems to be a line up out the door and down the street. I managed to get there right before the dinner rush thankfully, so it was not a very long wait time for us. I ordered the shoyu ramen and split the salmon on rice and chef special dumplings with my boyfriend. Let's just say, all the hype for this restaurant was for good reason.  PROS:  Food was absolutely delicious.  The pork in the ramen was to kill for. The dumplings were flavorful and cooked to perfection.  The salmon on the rice was also very tasty.  Service was quick and polite.  Staff was very attentive.  Price was fair; pretty standard for ramen - around $10/bowl.  The place was also very clean.  CONS: Not a fan of the waiting time, so I wish the restaurant was a little larger. The ramen was a little salty, even for ramen made with soy sauce.  All in all, still a good experience. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Small little store close to Ryerson. We went around 8pm and we're seated immediately. I had the spicy miso and my boyfriend had their shio ramen. I found the spicy miso broth quite salty. I much prefer the red miso broth at Ramen Ishin. However, I liked the shio broth since it had a milky lightly salted taste. We also ordered their pork cheek and it was super tender but nothing crazy. The bill for 2 bowls of ramen and 1 pork app was $50 so will likely not come back again."}
{"text":"My second favorite ramen joint in the city.    The Kara Miso Ramen is a must have for people who live spicy. Served piping hot, the noodles, broth, meat and mushrooms are quite simply delicious.  My only qualms are that the portion is small and expensive, which doesn't hold water considering my number 1 joint offers a little more goodness for less.   I wont hold that against a 5 star rating since this place is good in its own right."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen spot in Toronto! I love their broth and their side options (ikura don is my fave)."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I came to this ramen place.  I ordered the shoyu cha siu ramen (large).  The price is rather more expensive comparing to other places.  The broth is average and the thin noodle is overcooked.  The portion is large and you get about 5 small pieces of chasiu.  The service is rather rush.  As soon as you sat down, they will come to take your order.  As soon as they see you finish, they will bring you the bill.  I personally don't like this kind of service.  From the price and quality of the food and the service, I don't think I will be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hell happened to this place but the quality has went down a lot.  The soup was horrible and the noodles were bland.  They also force you to order $9.95 per person.  We wanted to share a $19 dollar combo with a $4 cheesecake and they forced us to order another ramen, which is absolutely retarded.  Id take instant ramen over this place.  Quality is similar, but no $9.95 minimum per person, and you're allowed to share."}
{"text":"Best Ramen Place in Toronto hands down. The servers and cooks enthusiastically greet you in Japanese right as you walk in. The place is small but has a cozy down to earth atmosphere.   The broth in their Ramen is like nothing else I have eaten. Savoury, creamy, chalk full of flavors. The pork succulent and soft. The noodles are just the right texture.  One day my boyfriend and I tried their green tea cheesecake. It was creamy, light with the right balance of green tea flavour. It tasted as if it was made in house."}
{"text":"So we stayed at a sketchy hotel (closer to a hostel) in Toronto on Dundas. The only advantage of that hotel was location and of course...passing by this ramen shop that had a line wrapped around the corner just to get a seat. My friends hate to wait, but I see a long wait as a sign that the food is amazing 90% of the time.   Well rather than wait in that line, I took a look at the hours and strategized. They open at 11 AM, we should go to lunch. So after checking out of the hotel, we headed to the Ramen shop and got there at 10:50 AM. Lucky us because 20 mins later there was a line forming when we sat inside to get an order.   We got the chef special dumplings and they were okay compared to other dumplings in Toronto. The highlight was the Shio Ramen. My god, I still dream about that Ramen til this day. The flavors were so mild, yet rich and umami. Of course I had to add a soft boiled egg for yokey deliciousness. We ended the meal with some green tea ice cream which was also good.   So was the wait worth the hype? Yes...but if you want less of a wait, go for lunch and beat the lines. You won't be disappointed with the shio ramen!   Overall: Service: 4 out of 5 Food: 5 out of 5 Decor/Drinks: 5 out of 5  14/15 for 5 star review!"}
{"text":"I love Hokkaido for ramen more than any other place in the city. The soup base is consistently delicious (which you can customize to your levels of salt and lard by simply telling the server), the meat is always tender and the noodles perfectly cooked. The service is always, always friendly, and quick - and it would have to be, there are always at least a handful of people waiting for your table!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of hype. There's always a lineup and I've seen it consistently rated one of the top ramen places in Toronto. This was my second time visiting Santouka and I can't say I'm all that impressed. The food was tasty but places like Sansotei and even Kinton I'd consider better. This place's biggest downfall was the lineup. We stood in line for about 20 minutes waiting with a medium-sized crowd of people (maybe around 12 people) on a Sunday afternoon while a bunch of empty tables stared back at us from the restaurant. The girl in front of us came alone and could have been seated right away, but they made her wait 20 minutes for a spot at the bar that was open all along. I don't mind waiting in line for places that are worth the wait but in this case it just seemed completely unnecessary. Maybe they were short-staffed, but you'd expect them to prepare better for the weekend crowd. My impression was that the wait and lineup was fully intentional. That's why there's probably always a line outside of this place. Who knows.   Once we were seated we were attended to right away and service was speedy. We felt a bit rushed throughout the meal seeing that we waited so long for a table.   We got gyoza for the starter which was good but nothing special. I decided to get the Tsukemen dipping ramen for my main which is a style of ramen I've been meaning to try for some time. The noodles themselves are cold and the dipping broth is hot and very flavourful (and also quite salty). The dish itself was actually quite good and the portion size was big because you get twice the amount of noodles you normally get with a regular ramen. When the dipping broth cooled the dish lost its charm a bit. We both worked on it and couldn't finish it finding it a bit too salty overall.   My partner got the Char-Shu Shoyu ramen. That one I would say was the better of the two. The broth was rich and tasty. In comparison to something like the Black TanTan from Sansotei or even the regular Shoyu from Kinton Santouka's still came up short. Don't get me wrong; it was good ramen, but not the best.  I also have to comment on the prices because Santouka charges on average $15 per bowl of ramen while other comparable ramen restaurants charge around $11. I was a bit shocked by how steep some of the bowls were.   Overall I'd say this place is NOT worth the hype. Definitely don't be fooled by the out-the-door lineup. I much prefer Sansotei which is only about a ten minute walk away, cheaper, and most definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Remember is really tasty, the soup is amazing; however my friend thought the soup was too salty. During dinning time long line up!"}
{"text":"Great ramen for a date night or double date! Seating is a little tight but as long as you don't mind waiting, it is SO worth it!   Pros:  - Service: All of the servers and cooks are so nice! They really help you with ordering if your not sure what to get. - Food: The soup base here for the ramen is a MUST HAVE! The broth tastes very different then other places.  - Picture worthy: Cute presentation makes for a great picture!   Cons:  - Line ups: The food here is so good that every time I've went I've always seen a line up. Most times it's from 15-45 minutes depending on how long the line. Just keep that in mind depending on how hungry your feeling!  - Seating: Seating in the restaurant is a little tight, I've only seen tables fitting about 4 people. If your eating for two, it's a great spot.  - Price: This place is a little pricier then others. One bowl of ramen can range from $12-15.   Foods I like:  - Shoyu Ramen: Creamy base, not as salty as the Miso Ramen   - Spicy Miso Ramen: If you like spicy ramen, this is the bowl for you. It gives a great kick."}
{"text":"I think the waitress laughed at us, but I dont mind. My friend asked innocently where the ingredients came from, because she really liked the mushrooms. Apparently all the ingredients are imported from Japan. And then she exclaimed she was from Japan too, smirked in a kind friendly way. I thought it was too amusing.  Maybe because she liked us, we both got a free topic coupon, or maybe everyone is getting one. I know the first 100 customers got a coupon for a free ramen from the sign in the front.  The ramen here is more fatty than the other ramen shops in Toronto. Even the pork is quite fatty. If you like that, its good. The service here is quick and there is a steady stream of people ready to replace you at any time at least when I went."}
{"text":"I think this is my favorite ramen in TO. Rich broth, nice meat (very fatty) and decent noodles. I think the noodles at Sansotei are better, but overall, my award for best overall ramen in TO goes to this place.  Good service. This place gets busy lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Simply the best. The place is very small but the turn around time to get a table is fast. The server greets you when you enter and when you leave in Japanese and it was like she was singing to me it sounded so nice. Miso ramen with pork - around $10 - soup was amazing and totally drinkable. Meat was tender and noodles and great texture and bite.  Soy flavour ramen with the higher quality pork with extra noodles - around $15 - the pork meat was on a different level. Super soft and tender and had the perfect balance of meat and fat. Sliced thin and oh so yummy. This was the most satisfying bowl of ramen I have had to date. I only wish they had an even larger size bowl for me."}
{"text":"Nothing can be more comforting than eating ramen late at night. The broth is definitely amazing and the noodles are very chewy. Worth a shot!"}
{"text":"both black and plain wood encapsulate this crammed space near toronto's heart  outgoing workers yell greetings in japanese in vibrant fashion   well-rounded menu though i just tunnelvisioned to spicy ramen  kara miso soup in a rather modest size looks appetizing!  creamy broth, mild spice miso-sesame flavours fun, chewy noodles  their pork is unreal heavily-marinated flavour explosion  a little pricey with its fourteen-dollar tag but i would come back"}
{"text":"Great ramen! Great combos! Everytime I've been there's always been lineups, but it's worth the wait. I get the chashu miso ramen all the time."}
{"text":"Gyoza were delicious  Got the spicy broth ramen with side of rice special. Served fast and very tasty. Not enough meat in my taste compared to the amount of noodles."}
{"text":"The Spicy Miso Ramen broth was delicious! But the ramen noodles were below average - seemed packaged and the veggies didn't feel fresh."}
{"text":"Have come here a couple times and it's always packed! Very delicious and you get a large portion, I can never finish it all. Loud, busy environment and great service staff that make you feel very welcome."}
{"text":"Flavorful rich broth and fresh tasting ingredients--authentic vibe and café-style restaurant"}
{"text":"Best ramen I've had in Toronto!  I've been to Kinto and Raijin. Both were good but Santouka delivered a well balanced bowl with impeccable broth. The three ramen joints are all very different on elements in a bowl of ramen. Kinto uses pork loins and particles of pork lard are often found in broth and they roast their pork pieces with a blow torch. Raijin's broth tastes less porky and the cabbage topping is a really nice touch. Santouka's broth, I suspect, is mainly pork bones and they give you the option of regular miso and spicy miso which blends nicely with the broth. There are also no visible balls of lard floating (Kinto) but just a nice layer of oil.  Santouka had the thinest noodle of them all. The bowl may look little but it is filled with noodles.   The service was incredibly fast and polite. My order was ready within three minutes.  I waited 30 minutes outside and would say it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Arrived at Santouka on a Friday evening to find a sizeable line up waiting outside the door.   Our wait (myself and my girlfriend) was probably longer than it had to be. Through the window, we could see bar space and tables go for 5-10 minutes without being filled. They had a runner who was tracking group sizes and such, but they would not use that list frequently to call smaller groups up ahead when seating was available. I know a lot of planning and thought needs to go into whether you seat that next table of 2 available, or wait for the foursome beside to finish (in order to seat your group of 6 that is ahead), but I think they just need more staff - one who manages tables and seating exclusively.  I ordered the Combination D: Shio Ramen + Cha-shu Gohan (Pork Rice Bowl); (+$1.00 for more noodles). The ramen was delicious - broth silky smooth, and noodles had the right firmness to them. A minor concern is that when the noodles had arrived at the table, the fat in the broth had already started to coagulate into a thin layer at the top of the soup (kinda makes you wonder how much delicious lard is really in there - haha).  My girlfriend ordered the Kara Miso Ramen - she enjoyed it and it was slightly spicy; however it was inarguable that the broth in the Shio Ramen was much better.  I would love to come back here to try the other options - however at a time that is less busy, or when their official opening occurs. There is more work needed with the logistics and handling of tables and seating. That is my only issue (-1 star)."}
{"text":"I love ramen, and imagine my delight to see that it's only a block away from the hotel!  The typical size, even the Vancouver ones too, not sure if this is part of the recipe lol.  Ordered the Shio, good tasting broth but the pieces of cha sew are the thickest I've ever had--and I eat out a lot.  Impressive, and good, with just the right amount of fat.  Value-wise, it's a bit on the light side.    Liked how they put their salt seasoning in real glass 'salt and pepper' glass fixtures on every table, a bit more classier.  Friendly service.  bonus star for the chefs all wearing blue bandanas, less chance of hair falling.  ps. just be careful for anyone taller than 5'10\", going down the stairs to the washroom can be dangerous, even the basement ceiling is low while walking normally.  They had a Dine.TO decal, so while not Yelp, figure it's something lol."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic ramen. Noodles are the perfect texture and the broth is unctuous. Small place but didn't feel cramped. It feels like you're stepping into a ramen shop in Japan. Get the egg."}
{"text":"So, after all the hype, I finally decided to come here, and it did not live up to the hype.   I will say that the ambiance feels authentic and very distinctly Japanese (or while we were there it did). It was reminiscent of going to Japan, packing into small little noodle shops, and ordering from a friendly, but not overbearing waitress. Food comes fast, and portions are large. Sidenote, this would be a really weird date spot, people are packed in pretty tight, and if you're on an awkward first date (which the funny couple beside us was), people will know :P   Where they lost me was the actual food. The noodles were good, but the soup is just TOOOOOOO SALTY. I get that noodles need to have a strong soup, but flavourful =/= salty, and this meant that I couldn't drink any of the soup, nor did I particularly want all the noodles. The meat on the noodles is more than I would have expected from a ramen house, and there are also other veggies, which is a nice touch.   ' Would I come back? Probably not, there are so many places that do noodles in Toronto, why waste time (and calories) on the subpar?"}
{"text":"Slurp! Slurp!!   I love a Japanese ramen bar. I love how fast and convenient it is and yet such a soul satisfying meal.   I tried the Shio Ramen here and got the large portion. (Don't judge!!) The ramen was very chewy and tasty, and the soup is excellent and flavourful, not too light, but not too strong. I don't have the utterance to describe it. But this is by far the best ramen I've had in the GTA. I'm serious!   If you like ramen, bookmark this place and make the short or long trip out there. You will be satisfied. And it's only $14 after tax for a large bowl. Niiiiceeeeeeee :D"}
{"text":"It's been a month and I still dream about this place at night. I ordered the shio ramen after debating on which flavor I wanted more, but went with the basic first. The noodles were perfectly boiled to my taste, and the chashu was a good balance of fat and meat. But the most surprising thing was that I polished off the entire bowl. I don't mean that I just ate all the noodles and meat... I ate every scrap of vegetable, miniscule bit of noodle strand, and drank every drop of the broth. That is a complete first for me. I always leave something behind, but I was left wanting more, which is the perfect time for me to quit while I'm ahead. Cannot wait to come back, because it's totally worth the 4 hour drive!"}
{"text":"One of the best ramen places that I've been to.  The most important factor for me when I dig into ramen is that first bite with the combination of broth, ramen, and meat and this was AWESOME.  Their shio ramen is a great first one to try on their menu as the broth is just so rich and good.  If you order a combo, it comes with a side dish and we had salmon roe with rice which was also quite delicious as well.    Overall, I'd definitely come back to this place for ramen if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"3.5/5. +.5 for the service.  So I've tackled the second ramen joint who claim to be the \"best\" in Toronto (the first one being Kenzo). I'll try Kinton and Sansotei in the near future.  I arrived today at around 1:45pm. No lineup! In fact, the place was only about 3/4 full. I was instantly seated (and greeted in Japanese), given a menu, and ordered the Toroniku ramen with miso.  The portion was about right considering I'm not exactly the biggest eater (there's no way I can be a Kinton Bowler!). The soup was a little bit on the salty side, but I guess next time I could ask for less salt. The pork on the sides was one of the best I've ever had, just the right about of meat and fat. The noodles were a little bit thinner than what I thought, and sadly...I found Kenzo's noodles better.  When I was done, the waitress took away my meal and gave me the bill. However, I didn't want to leave yet so I tested them to see if they would walk around me seeing if I paid the bill or not. 20 minutes later, they haven't, so it does show they're willing to let people stay.  In terms of value...$20+ (including drink) was a little bit over what I anticipated the value to be. I would've been satisfied if it was $15.  I'll definitely try the other two ramen \"bests\" before making a decision if I'd come back or not, but I was satisfied overall."}
{"text":"I had the spicier Ramen at the bottom of the Ramen list - it was delicious. The place itself is quaint but busy - real Japanese staff - complete with the irasshaimase welcome. Relatively few tables so be prepared to wait if you arrive in the middle of lunch, dinner hours.  They also won't seat you until your entire party has arrived. A slightly annoying but understandable situation for a place like that. Worth the visit."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Toronto! Portions are enough for a person, the noodles are perfectly cooked (you can also adjust cook times to your liking). The broth is beyond flavorful, although can be a little salty you can also adjust the amount of salt. Definitely my go to ramen spot in Toronto."}
{"text":"Not bad at all, Santouka!   I've been here a few times, and although the broth is not as tasty as some other ramen joints, I do love their meat. (I'm weak for meat.) The food is served up quite quickly, and the waiters are cheerful and attentive. It's a bit more expensive than other places, but it still tastes good!  It's always busy, but you should definitely come by on odd hours like at 4 or 5 pm. Also, their washroom is quite low in height and not exactly the cleanest. I've seen a couple flies milling about inside.   In terms of ramen joints, this might be my second or third favorite in Toronto. I don't come that often but I certainly wouldn't mind eating here again!   Favorites: Pork jowl (soooo worth the extra price)."}
{"text":"Amaaaaaaazzzzzing ramen! Perfect for the cold canadian winter . This place is really small and cosy , there is always a bit of a wait but it's worth it ."}
{"text":"This is probably the one of the best, if not the best, ramen restaurant in the city! I've tried quite a few already and the broth here is excellent and consistent. The spicy broth isn't overwhelmingly spicy either. It's a bit pricier than other ramen restaurants but they do give you more toppings and noodles. Just a note: They have only pork ramen at this place!  Staff was friendly and accommodating. The place was busy but it is a small restaurant. There is usually a line up around dinner time, but the wait isn't that long since most people just eat and go fairly quickly.  I would definitely come back for ramen if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Apparently Santouka has the best ramen in Toronto according to a fellow Yelper. I've tried several ramen places but they usually all taste the same to me. My sister also raved about how this place has really good ramen so we decided to go on the weekend.   Be prepared to wait for a table if you're arriving for lunch. We had to wait about 20 minutes until we were seated. The restaurant was able to deliver an authentic Japanese ramen shop which made you feel like you weren't in downtown Toronto. We were greeted in Japanese by all of the staff.   My sister and I ordered the miso ramen that day. Additionally, I added the soft boiled egg. I can't believe they charge so much for one egg--it was about $1.60. The thing that stood out about Santouka's ramen over every where else is the pork. It was tender and very flavourful! Delicious!  Overall, Santouka is a good ramen place if you're in the area and want ramen. I would definitely want to try other ramen places just to compare."}
{"text":"I am gonna start this review off with a little short blurb that I felt really pressured to give a 4+ stars after reading the reviews of everyone previously. But I am still giving it a 3/5. Resist the peer pressure and stick to your own opinion!   First impression was that the place is rather small, especially from the outside. After waiting in the long lunch line, we walk into the restaurant to realize that the seats were super close to each other. And if it is a party of two, you're basically going to be sitting next to another party of two. This \"double date\" thing bothers me a lot because there is literally no privacy.   The food was alright. For 12 dollars, I really feel like there could be more in it. Broth was super salty, but I should have known to ask for less salt. There were only two pieces of fatty pork.   Place was so rushed that no water was given. It was almost as if we had to sit, eat, pay then leave. I would comment on the service but the server was only seen twice, both times barely any interaction.   Tips: - Remember, one person must at least spend $9.95 dollars  - The combination set is more worth it if you're hungry (rice, appetizer, and main meal) - Come earlier or later (during lunch) to beat the line - Ask for less salt! The soup is super salty. It is easier to add salt to your plain meal than to not enjoy your salty meal altogether"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this place for his birthday back in Nov 2016. I'm just now leaving a review because I was looking through my pictures in my phone. This place was so damn good we came back the next day and the line was out the door! We waited just so I could eat here :) I recommend if you love ramen to eat here. We drove from Cortland, NY to stay in Canada for the weekend and when we visit again we will be stopping back here. If you drove, just make sure you pay for the parking which is right next door. It's only 10 Canadian dollars which was about 7 US dollars and you can't beat that! This place does require you to spend at least $20 so bring a friend!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I would always go for Ajisen ramen, it's the most flavorful and all other options in the city serve creamy broth but not tasty!  We tried the ramen here once (I got a plain shoyu ramen + plum wine) and OMG it was divine! The broth was very creamy AND very flavorful! The noodles were just perfectly cooked, meat was soft and chewy and altogether was very filling. the plum wine paired so well with the ramen too. Despite all that goodness, I'd say it would be nice if there's more vegetables on the basic ramens. I frowned looking at the boiled vegetables side-dish being 4$ as a small addition. Like c'mon vegetables should be cheap! The expensive price is what the lack of one star is for."}
{"text":"Great ramen and the waiter was very polite. There's a minimum order of $15 to eat here though, which is out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Ramen is decent side dishes are decent. Only problem is probably portion sizes and price. For what you pay the portion size is just too small compared to other ramen restaurants. Even after getting their combo I would leave feeling a little empty."}
{"text":"Nice little place. Absolutely great Ramen! The soup is tasty and addictive, the pork (chef special) is delicious!  Definitely a solid go-to place for Ramen lovers!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"(3.5 stars)  Came at 5:30pm on a weeknight and got one of the last tables! The place is crammed with tables very close together, or you can sit at the bar. All in all, a tasty ramen place but I would not wait in line for ramen no matter how good it is!   I had the salmon rice & shio ramen combo (~15). It was a good amount of food -- kind of carb heavy!! The broth was hearty, not too salty to be overpowering, and hit the spot on a wintery day. It is pretty fatty -- you can see the oil glistening on the top of the soup, but I think the deluxe ramen (which is only available in limited quantities and costs $16 for just a bowl of noodles) allows you to customize how fatty you want the broth. The ramen noodles were just right -- al dente and springy. It came with mushrooms, bamboo, and 2 juicy and tender pieces of pork. There was an egg on the side, but it was just a hard-boiled egg, not with the semi-gooey yolk like at other places. The salmon on the rice was kind of dry, although the rice itself was really good (I know it's just plain rice, but they added something to make it more flavourful).   Service was very attentive and polite. When I went, the two tables next to me were occupied by Japanese people (like, they were speaking Japanese to the servers) -- I feel that this is a good mark of authenticity! However, I wish this place was bigger and that you didn't feel rushed (we felt bad sitting there after we finished our meal because of the lineup). In terms of the ramen competition in the city, I would say this place is on par with Sansotei, perhaps with Sansotei having a slight edge, and I'd place it a tiny bit ahead of Raijin and way ahead of momofuku noodle bar."}
{"text":"Friendly, quick and the Ramen is phenomenal! We ordered the fried pork dumplings and they are completely delectable. I'd suggest ordering a egg and extra pork for your Ramen. Not because you need to as the portion is adequate but come on....porky goodness! 5  Will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy going for ramen, so we tried Santouka and it was okay. Our preference is definitely Kinton for a few reasons. Santouka has a nice modern décor, yet you're not there long enough to enjoy it. There is waiting involved, as with almost any ramen place now-a-days, and once you're in, they're dying for you to get out and let more people in. Do not go for Ramen if you want to chill and chat. The noodles: a bit salty and chewy, and small portions in comparison to other places. The hub ordered the toroniku ramen which was very good, probably their best dish. Still, if I'm going to line-up for ramen, it won't be here. It's obviously a personal preference."}
{"text":"First time here.  Place is a bit small but great service and great food. Atmosphere is great with Japanese speaking staff."}
{"text":"I was told this is one of the best ramen spots downtown. We ended up waiting around 10 minutes but the food was delicious. The noodles are chewy and perfect."}
{"text":"YUM! May have been the best ramen I've ever had. I don't claim to be a ramen connoisseur, but man was it tasty. Perfect for a chilly night in Toronto. My fiance has always said that he doesn't like ramen that much, but he loved it here!   It's a little pricier than some of the other places we looked at, but we were only visiting for a few days so I figured we'd go with one of the best (also to two visiting Americans it was great to see things in dollars and then realize it was 30% cheaper than you thought.) I love that they have combos. We both got spicy miso. The pork was tender, the noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth was on point. Not sure what else you could want.  I got mine with the fish eggs over rice and my fiance got his with the pork - both great!  On a sunday night at about 8pm I think there wasn't too much of a wait. Less than 10 minutes. The space is a bit small though so I can imagine it gets pretty packed. Also the bathroom ceilings are hilariously low, made for shorties like me."}
{"text":"I waited about an hour outside just to try the ramen here!  Once inside, this place is a lot smaller and cozier than it looks from the outside.  The restaurant had naturally high ceilings but they lowered the ceiling with wooden beams to create a more natural environment.  The washroom in the basement is really cute, because the ceilings are about 6ft high and I feel like I'm in a play house.  The menu selection was small, but I like that because it shows that they are very specialized in what they serve, which is ramen.  The ramen was served quickly and the service was very good.  This makes the turn-around rate of the restaurant really high, and that is a good thing for all of the people waiting outside in the cold.  The ramen was very simple and tasted good.  The broth was flavourful and the combinations of toppings were very traditional.  I admit, I don't eat a lot of ramen, but I did enjoy Santouka and would come back again."}
{"text":"In and out within the hour, including the line up!   When we first got there there was a line out the door. But it moved quite quickly. Since the restaurant is so small the service was quite quick.   I ordered a shio ramen and gyoza. Gyoza was done well hard and crispy on the bottom, it came with my ramen. The broth was quite flavourful with green onions, bamboo shoots, wood ear mushrooms and 2 pieces cha shu.   I personally like thick noodles and I don't think this place gives you an option. Overall the bowl looks small but it was quite filling.   I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"It seems like people in Toronto have never eaten Ramen before, whereas, I have had it in Japan numerous times, and well, it's really nothing special, just a staple type of dish in Japan.  Just another added \"ramen\" craze in Toronto - the place is small and you have to wait in line.   But I really had to see what this talk of Santouka was all about because apparently, I heard it's as closed to the \"authentic\" Japanese ramen as you could possibly get.   Even better than Kinton because they prepare their soup ingredients in a special way.  Oooo....   Alright, so I waited in line like everyone else.   I always wonder why they can't make the ramen restaurants bigger!   Definitely not a place you would love to sit and dine.  It's more like, you eat and get out right away.   I would get this concept in Asia, but can't really accept that fact in Toronto.     Good ramen.  I don't like my ramen to have a strong \"PORK\" smell flavour.   The Shio was perfect.   The fish roe rice combo was a nice touch.  I think I would love to try their Shoyu next time.     I would come back again if I didn't have to wait in line."}
{"text":"This place is more expensive than other ramen place and I personally don't think it's outstanding. Was it delicious? Yes. Is it worth the lineup? No. The restaurant is small and the lineup was medium and I had to line up for about an hour to get in. The worst part is that we can see empty seats and they don't seat their customers quickly! So they need to work on their turnover. I would come back here only if I was in that part of town, hungry, craving ramen and there was no lineup."}
{"text":"While the ramen was good, the service was terrible in both times I've gone. The first time we were 2 people and they tried to force us to sit at the bar rather than at one of the tables at a non-peak hour with many tables free. The second time, when I was handed my change I was condescendingly reminded that it was \"change without tip\" and the change they gave me was in a way that forced to either tip $5 (25% of my bill) or nothing. Cannot believe that a restaurant would treat their customer like this."}
{"text":"Came here on 01/12/2015 with my girlfriend, as we're trying out all the ramen places in the downtown area. We had seen this place before, but walked away as there was a line, so we got there around 5:00 p.m. this time, and no line. I recommend if you want to try this place, avoid peak times as it is very small.  The atmosphere was great, it was similar to other ramen places, being greeted when you came in Japanese, and the tables crammed together to try and make use of the space. But what kind of ramen place would it be without that? Price was also standard and quite comparable to other ramen places ~$12 for a basic bowl.  To the food: I ordered the Kara Miso Ramen with the Grilled Salmon Don side, while my girlfriend got the Shio Ramen to try. The broth is thick and creamy, if not a little salty, but it was probably the best broth I've had at a ramen place. As for the meat, it was cooked very well, but the grilled salmon bowl was great. The salmon wasn't too fishy and the seaweed they topped the rice with brought it all together.  Definitely recommend this place and after we finish our downtown ramen tour, we will be back to have this again.  Food: 5/5 Service: 3/5 Location: 4/5"}
{"text":"Santouka is a tiny little place that (thankfully) took over the spot Wendy's Deli Cafe used to own. The room is packed with atmosphere, helped by the cheerful hostesses and chefs. The waitress made sure we were always taken care of, and the chefs made it a point to say goodbye as we were leaving.   Great service aside, I really did not find my food that impressive. I had the Shoyu Ramen (Pork with Soy Sauce Flavour).  The broth was good but a little bland. I did like the taste of the noodles, and loved the fact that you could customize just about anything in your bowl. I found the price point a little high for the average taste of the food. I ate from the soft serve menu, and I will visit again for the full open to see if I can find anything I like from the larger variety."}
{"text":"These people take their ramen very seriously. No outside food or drink is allowed and they do not really allow photos - so you have to be sneaky:p. There is also a minimum charge of $20 in order to be served. If you come here you will not be disappointed though as the ramen and the techniques are spot on. The PORK cheeks are an absolute MUST when you come here / it's one of the things this place is known for!"}
{"text":"The tables were empty at 4pm and they would not let us sit. Waited 15 minutes to be asked so we just left. Terrible service and disgusting behaviour. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!"}
{"text":"Great service, awesome ramen. What else can you ask for in this cold day in Toronto?  Metered parking lot available next to the building.    So wanted to try the rice bowl and noodle combo posted from other Yelpers and I'm glad I did.  I upped my noodle for extra $1 and got a bigger bowl with more noodles.  So worth it.    2 combos + 2 pop + 1 kimchi totaled $46.  Awesome, so worth it.  Broth is nice and fatty, I needed a pop and kimchi to cut the grease.  Cooks and servers are all so professional and courteous.  You get greeted as you enter and as you leave in Japanese.  This made me very happy to have eaten here."}
{"text":"Maybe its the Okinawa style (not familiar with the differences of of region style). Didnt live up to my expectations. Good thing i came early and didn't wait in line for too long. I found it to be oily, noodles were saggy and a little blend. The salad with tofu was a joke. I will never order it again."}
{"text":"I'm having the Spicy Miso Ramen. Spicy soybean paste flavour. Their \"spicy miso ramen\" features three kinds of chili peppers added to a miso sauce based on a secret recipe. They highly recommend this ramen, whose miso has rich yet sharpness that may be habit-forming."}
{"text":"Came here once and it happened to be their 4(?) year anniversary! The staff were very nice!   I got the Miso-base ramen and it was absolutely delicious! My only gripe was that you had to pay for toppings separately, such as the braised egg, not sure if this is a common practice amongst TO ramen shops. Despite this, the ramen was great and I would definitely go back and pay a little extra for such bomb food."}
{"text":"I would listed Santouka as the best in the Down town area. As a reference, I've been to Kenzo, Kinton, Momofuku, Ramen Raijin, Sansotei, Touhenboku and Ryu's. In order to have a filling stomach, I usually pick the Soi broth ramen with a grilled salmon rice combo (#22). It is always good to have some rice at the end.  Their service is quick but kinda rushing you at the same time. This is the reason I gave them a four stars instead of a five."}
{"text":"The negative reviews are from people who like to think they know what they're doing in life but really don't. Poor sad fools. Best Ramen in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been here before and have had long wait times, passed by numerous times only to walk on because the lines are so long.... but one day a colleague and I popped by during a weekday lunch to find it pleasantly vacant!   (If you can get in) expect cramped eating areas, but friendly service and good food. Haven't had ramen this good in the GTA. The noodles don't taste like they came out of a package (but who really knows, I'm no savant), and the broth was smooth and flavorful. Came in after I was sick for a few days for a small simple meal and ended up finishing it because it was so good. Downgraded to a small portion size and was still satisfied by the end.   Will definitely return (if the lines allow)!"}
{"text":"After reading so many great reviews, I had to try this Ramen place. And I have to say that I left disappointed, and I won't be coming back. Good: - Location - The staff was really friendly - Lots of little tables (?) Bad: - No parking, park on street and pay - Not that cheap for that size of soup - No vegetarian options for Ramen soup - I asked less salt and it was still way too salty! Pretty disturbing. - Option for less or more lard?! Hmmm, none please! - I got miso pork broth with vegetables that included few tiny pieces of mushrooms, bamboo shoot, and green onions. That's it? Mostly noodles and salty broth. Boring. I actually said that I don't want meat pieces, so the waitress asked if I want extra green onion pieces instead!!! Really? I thought it was funny. Bottom line, I prefer Ramen soups that are not that salty, have more vegetables, include an egg or broccoli, are bigger in size, etc."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Based on the rating I thought it was going to be better than it actually was. My boyfriend and I went for lunch and both got the regular sized spicy miso ramen. You have the option of adding or subtracting $1 for more or less noodles. If you're a big/tall/average built guy, I would say size up because my boyfriend's hunger was not satisfied...  The broth was a bit too salty for our taste and we only barely got 2 pieces of pork with the ramen. When the bowls were set in front of us, there was a big piece, but don't be deceived because my second piece was so small, I almost didn't even realize there was a second piece of pork. I kind of wished there was more than 1.5 pieces still.  Overall this place was just ok. I'm glad we tried it but this wouldn't be our go to place for ramen or anything..."}
{"text":"One of the better ramen places in the city. The noodles and broth here is what standout compared to other places. I also got a side of gyoza when I was there that was pretty good. I've only been the one time but I've been meaning to go back, so that's a good sign. It can get busy so I'd recommend going slightly off hours."}
{"text":"Brilliant. The portions aren't as huge as other Ramen shops, but they are realistic. I feel like everything at this place is above average but not the best. The noodles are quite great though."}
{"text":"The spicy broth here is delicious!  This is just what we needed on a cold night.  We were visiting Toronto for the first time, but this definitely wasn't my first time having ramen.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking to get a reasonably priced bowl of soup.  The pork jowl (cheek) was much better than the pork belly.  The pork belly was mostly fat, which is expected, but I think the overall flavor of the jowl was better tasting.  The sparkling sake with gelatin was surprisingly good, even my boyfriend liked it.  The texture wasn't as weird as I expected and it was actually kind of fun to have in your mouth (so weird, I know, but hard to explain).  The line went quickly as the food is ordered, prepared, and served quickly for rapid turnover.  Please don't be discouraged by the line and I promise it will be worth the 20 minute wait!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of the best Ramen place in town! I've been to this place as many times as I there are noodles in their bowl. Lots of options to choose from for the soup base, the amount/hardness of noodles to the sides. The only thing that I've recently noticed is that the pork/chasyu is not the same size as before and is not charred. Still good, though. I'm waiting for the new location at Yonge/Davisville/Eglinton area to open up!  Service is also great here. Word of caution, be there before 12 noon specially on Friday. The lineup can be very very long even during the winter mont"}
{"text":"Back to Hokkaido Ramen Santouka after a while and it is still the best and most authentic ramen in town. The flavour and depth have not changed. The décor is still the same. There are less people dining there, which might be because Jinya and Kinton have opened locations nearby. That works for me because I love the Santouka ramen and dislike the line-up.  I need to live a little because as usual I ordered the Toroniku miso and really enjoyed it. Their exclusively imported chashu was as good as ever. The jowls are perfect to be eaten on their own or as intended with the ramen. However, things are getting very pricey for a ramen at $18.50. The noodle is tasty and the broth has some depth. When was the last time anyone said that about Kinton's ramen? Maybe around 2010?? You can now also modify your broth's taste and choose your noodle kind.   The taller girl was providing good service, but the taller man was rather indifferent. Still, they are fine and as long as they do not lower their quality I will be back. Please please don't Canadianize or dilute your ramen like other places. Santouka is still pushing its luck by not offering the mandatory egg with its ramen, which is a shame, trying to sell bowls, fruity drinks and alcohol and really needs to open a couple of more outlets (unless it makes them like Kinton lower quality and diluted)."}
{"text":"I used to like Sanotuka a lot but the last couple of times have been really disappointing. Today for example, I ordered a Shoyu Ramen and it was served with two slabs of inedible pork fat, pure fat I kid you not. It was really gross. Worst of all the stubborn kitchen did not want to replace it, it was not like I was sending the whole dish back and wanted something else, I just wanted two little slices of gross fat to be replaced with actual pork meat as a ramen should be served.  At the end the taste of fat was too pronounced and ruined the broth.    I don't know why the kitchen thinks garbage should be served to customers."}
{"text":"Wow quality has gone down compare to the last time I was here. I got the spicy dipped ramen and the soup base was extremely salty, like MSG SALTY. Also it was not spicy at all! I tried to add the spicy flakes and it did nothing to the soup. When I inquired with the waitress, she did nothing and told me the soup is supposed to be salty... I understand that the ramen might be more saltier than others, but this was so salty to the point it was inedible. I ended up not eating and she still charged me full price for it, without offering to even add water so the broth is less salty.   Also, the egg was hard boiled, not the ones with soft yolk. I asked the waitress and she told me the egg is supposed to be hard boiled for Japanese ramen..... So I don't know..... Have I been eating ramen wrong for my entire life??  The service was really bad this time. They gave my table the bill when I didn't ask for it. It felt like they were rushing us and there was no one waiting for tables.   Conclusion: will never return."}
{"text":"Our food came within 5 minutes of us sitting down and service is fast and efficient. Flavourful ramen."}
{"text":"Really!?  this place is definitely over-rated.  i'll admit, this is a hot spot, awesome location with eaton centre just down the street.  line up's are bustling out the door down the sidewalk.  but damn, i don't know if i went in with high expectations, but the ramen was mehh. selection is grander then kinton (the other famously toronto ramen shop). able to order rice and ramen as a combo. apps and other things as such.  i tried the salmon rice with ramen combo approx $15. amazingly, they allow for large and small size. of course i opted for the small since i love small bites. and loved the portion! sometimes it's just too small, or too big but it was just right and to have hearty soup right smack in the winter is just delicious!   but it's far from extraordinary. just the standard ramen to expect and i was glad at least it was not horrible and a rip off.  btw, went in around 530pm on a friday, whoot, no lineup! max wait was about ohh, two minutes!  i think the lineup out the door started around 6pm-ish? lucky to miss that mayhem in the cold. but awesome for me to see it! and know i just missed it.  all in all, enjoy this place if you're in the area! but don't venture out here unnecessarily.  atmosphere: 4.5 food: 2.5 price: 2.5"}
{"text":"I came with a large party. So a variety of noodles were ordered. I must admit I felt rushed. We were charged and payed our bill before our dessert came out. I felt the noodles were good. Decent quality. The pork meat I get was a bit too salty for my taste. Overall a rather plain ramen."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekend as they were just opening to avoid the crowd. Was seated in front of the kitchen which I didn't mind as it's always nice to see where your food is coming from. Chair bothered me a bit as it felt flimsy. Ordered the spicy char siu ramen. Order arrived rather quickly. Presentation of the ramen looked rushed and messy. Broth was a bit on the saltier side which was more than I'd like. The overall noodles in texture was comparable to the instant noodles you could make at home. For the price that was being asked it was a decent experience at best. Service was the saving grace here."}
{"text":"I've only had the noodles here, so I can't comment on other items on the menu.  I think I like the broth here best compared to other ramen joints, and the noodles are pretty good. However, the lineups are an absolute turn off, and the inefficiency of the staff is frustrating.  They're nice and polite but not the most efficient I'm afraid.  I only come here when it's relatively late at night, and even then we have to wait.  Come on."}
{"text":"This is by far the best ramen place ive been too in downtown Toronto (in comparison to santosei, kinton n momofuku). I had ordered shio ramen with a side of a boiled egg. The boiled egg had amazing flavoring on its own. The broth that the noodles came in was bursting wit a combination of flavors that makes you wanting more. The one thing that i did not like was their ability to attend to their customers in line. They need to find a more efficient way to man their wait list."}
{"text":"A tiny spot for ramen that serves up big taste!   Hands down the best spot for ramen."}
{"text":"A solid ramen experience. The soup broth is nicely flavored, delivering a balanced punch of salty flavor. Egg has to be ordered as an 'extra', though when it comes it is perfectly cooked. you can taste that it has been marinated, delivering a light salty and slightly sweet aromatic flavor in the white - very yummy. The noodles are standard crinkly noodles with a traditional texture that meets expectations. I've been at this location (and others in the US) and can say that the pork is consistently cooked well. However, this last time I did find that the pork was more fatty than I cared for. Though the venue can get busy, you can count on excellent service. The staff is friendly and responsive. Go early to avoid the line."}
{"text":"Honestly my favourite place to eat in Toronto! I take all of my friends here when they come visit because I feel like everyone should get to experience this place at least once.   It is usually busy at lunch time and dinner around 6pm but on weekdays around 3-4 I've never had to wait in line. But if you do encounter a line it's worth the wait since the food comes so quickly.  They have a couple different types of ramen but my personal favourite is the Shio ramen with a beer. Bowls of ramen with a side are usually around $14-$17 depending on what you get but single bowls run for less.  I 100% think the price is worth what you get here and think anyone debating on stopping by should try it out!   The atmosphere here is also amazing, it's a cozy space and you may be seated quite close to people but besides that the general feel is very welcoming along with the staff. I've never had bad service here and they always have a smile on their face and do their best to get the food out to you quickly. They also bring you a basket for the side of your table to put your jackets and bags in :)   SOME TIPS: the pork is smaller than in the pictures so if you want more, you can order a bowl that comes with more slices You may need to grab the servers attention for the bill once you're done You can ask for them to trim off the fat of the pork if that's not your thing  The bathrooms are downstairs but have VERY low ceilings so if you're anything above 5'11 you might have the crouch  Overall this is my favourite place in Toronto for ramen, if you are debating on visiting I strongly urge anyone to give it a try! Very cozy atmosphere, great ramen and very kind, & attentive staff."}
{"text":"I've been to a few ramen places in Toronto.  Broth: 9/10 I like the broth here a lot, it was super creamy. I had the shio broth which I think is milder than with shoyu or miso. Some of my coworkers commented that it was super salty but I was OK with it.  Meat: 8/10 The meat was fatty and juicy, just the way I like it - I just wish I got more. I guess I could've ordered more, but it would be nice to just get more by default.  Noodles: 7/10 Not too big of a fan of the noodles, I like the ones at Kinton more. The noodles here were not as thick and chewy as I usually like them.  I'd say this is my second favorite ramen place in Toronto, right after Kinton. Gets pretty packed at noon, I recommend going early."}
{"text":"There are a lot of options in Toronto for ramen but I'm happy we decided with Hokkaido. The service is quick but friendly. I like how the confirm with you via ipad so you get the right order. The menu has a lot of different choices for ramen and I appreciate that. The ramen is flavorful, the meat tender and overall a stellar bowl of ramen. The cost felt pricey but totally worth every cent."}
{"text":"I had a strange and unpleasant experience today.  My friend and I were meeting here for an early dinner, and as I arrived first, I sat at the bar and ordered some gyoza to have while I was waiting.  When my friend showed up, we asked to be seated at a table, and were \"not allowed\" to, despite there being 2 or 3 free tables and no lines at 5:30 pm on a weekday.  Because we preferred to not eat at the bar, I wanted to settle my bill so we could go elsewhere, but was told that there is a $9.95 minimum per person, which I had yet met.  In the end, we tried to just give them $10 without ordering anything so we could go, and the waiter finally just let me pay for my appetizer.  My friend and I felt uncomfortable as there were two waiters standing around us telling us the rules of the restaurant, and we did not feel welcome to either stay or go.  I have never experienced anything like this before and it was thoroughly awkward and unreasonable."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for Santouka ramen. They do it very well. Had the Kara miso ramen. Very creamy and nice thin noodles. It was on the spicier side than usual spicy ramens, but that's my thing so I was very pleased. Excited to come back for another bowl."}
{"text":"Even better than the Vancouver Santouka! Try the salmon & ramen combo!"}
{"text":"As a former Ryerson grad, I'm really sad this place wasn't open earlier! I would have visited this place weekly!  Santouka has awesome ramen both with or without soup. The ramen has just the right chewiness and texture.   I love ginger and during the winter time they have a special Ginger Ramen which is extremely satisfying. Warms you right up on a cold day.  During the Spring and Summer, my favourite is the Tsuke-men. This is a thicker style of cold ramen that you dip in a hot soup. I like having it with the spicy soup. The concept of eating this is similar to having Soba but the noodles are completely different.  Service is fast and friendly but be prepared to wait during peak hours as this place is small. You'll also sit very closely to other people so conversations aren't that private.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen with excellent service. My Japanese friend said this is pretty close to what a Japanese ramen store serves and tastes like. There's not a lot of seat though and the waitress won't fill a table as soon as it's empty, leading to a huge crowd waiting at the entrance. It can get problematic in winter with long lineup and small waiting area"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say it's best but compared to a lot of the ramen places in the area it's a little pricey. Not sure why because quality is only comparable. The best thing I thought was they provided my toddler daughter with some kiddie bowls and utensils that came in a tray ala airplane food style."}
{"text":"I just moved to Toronto and expecting quality ramen.  Had some good ones in Calgary and hoped Toronto would be better.  I chose this location because it was closer to my home and within walking distance.  Ended up disappointed.  The soup was alright but I've had better in Calgary...I guess onto my next restaurant.  In search of the best Ramen in Toronto still."}
{"text":"Best Ramen ever! Actually we are (again) going for it today after work. I've been to Ajisen Ramen in finch but this one is absolute best!  If its your first time giving it a try, I reccommend you to go for the white tonkutso soup  --- the Shio Ramen, it has a mild  salt flavor, creamy gentle aroma, the touch of bamboo shoot in a ramen is just perf! I love it! My fiance and I love to add hanjuku tamago (soft boiled egg) to our ramen (extra charge)  and chefs special ----Yaki Gyoza (fried dumpling) on the side.  yum!  Slurp until the last drop!   but be prepared to fall in line if you are going here after 8pm, yes even on a weekday! But worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The fact that I await for a cold day in Toronto so that I can have even more of an excuse to go here explains my rating of 5. Their ramen rivals the stuff I had in Japan. If you go, you should go big and order their premium ramen. It is a bit pricier but worth it all the way. In the meantime, it is lunchtime at work and I am going to keep dreaming of those delicious noodles and that savoury tender pork..."}
{"text":"I have been Japenese Ramen reatarant several times, and I just don't get it. The broth is so salty for me. I like the clear and thin broth, totally opposite to this. This time my friend highly recommended me of this place because there are lining up people all the time? It's not you; it's me. Next time my friend bring me to a ramen restaurant, I will say no firmly.  The pork is amazing. There was a choice to order a plate of pork only and I didn't seize it."}
{"text":"Overall the have a lot of varieties and combinations of food. They have good Japanese beer selection as well. The ramen taste well but the soup tends to be salty, maybe Hokkaido style? If you prefer less salty, you may ask your server when you order.   Hey also provide a good sauce for their Gyoza. Among all ramen place in Toronto, I would rate this restaurant among the top 5. And I come here often since this location has lot of parking option and near my office."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen! Haven't had ramen like that since I was in Japan. I recommend the spicy miso ramen with an egg."}
{"text":"Hands down best ramen in the city. We waited 10 minutes in line but the place smelled so delicious that I didn't mind waiting. We ordered a bowl of Spicy Miso Ramen, and the famous pork cheek that came with Shio ramen (I don't remember the name right now - but it was the last on the menu). We also got the nice cream soda which was delicious. Staff were super nice, and service was fast. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best Japanese ramen spots in Toronto.   Having been here twice in the last two weeks, I think its one of the few that can compare to Ippudo. The wait is unavoidable, even at 9pm there's still a line up at the door.   Shio ramen is good but the broth is a bit salty for my liking.  The pork cheek meat just melts in your mouth!  Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"We checked into our hotel  after 7 pm and were furiously looking for a place to eat, (having arrived super hungry from San Francisco, with no time to eat during connection in Detroit) when I looked out our window and saw a brick building  with Santouka printed on the outside.  Let's go there!  It was great!  Long line but we only waited 15 minutes.....  We had the miso flavored ramen and an order of gyzo.  The broth was extremely tasty and the meat was perfect.  I'm not sure, but I don't  think there's a lot of variety among all the ramen offerings. They all looked the same.    The gyzo was perfection.  Service was very sweet and put up with me messing up the electronic method of billing!  Really cold here, end of April, so ramen hit the spot."}
{"text":"Solid ramen but nothing compared to what we had down the street at Sansotei the day before.   Tried our staple of gyoza and spicy miso ramen (added fish cakes and egg)."}
{"text":"My go to Ramen place, originally based purely off of location. I think, after trying a lot of different Ramen, that it has the best broth in Toronto. The portions aren't huge but there are three options for sizes. The gyoza's are always a flavourful addition, but the ramen has hit the spot every time I've been. I do think the eggs could be more soft boiled but other than that, I have no complaints. I continue to come every two/three weeks and it's worth the price as well."}
{"text":"SHOYU RAMEN. Still the best ramen at Santouka. I really really wish that they would open one in Markham and preferably right next to Sansotei, because they would beat out Sansotei hands down. I've tried Santouka in the suburbs outside of Chicago and Vancouver. The quality of their broth is always top notch and consistent. The Shoyu is a nice, creamy, and salty broth that is cooked for 48 hours and trust me, you can taste the depth of flavour. I took off one star because their small rice bowl we ordered with the ramen combo had too much moisture. This teaches us to STICK TO THE RAMEN!! I will return!!"}
{"text":"A decent place to grab a quick bowl of ramen in the heart of downtown Toronto. Although not my favourite ramen joint, the spicy miso ramen is quite decent if you like your noodles on the stronger tasting side.  I would rate this place higher but found the portion size of meat to be somewhat unsatisfying...so it does add up if you are a big meat eater like myself  Overall, a fan"}
{"text":"Honesly this is not real J-styple....I am not going back!     Yes, it is one of hot spot in Toronto downtown but taste and price are no good (so yes, This place is definitely over-rated.)   Maybe I had too much expectation because of long line up and good reviews. But, to  me with that price, I can just go to the other J-noodle places because nothing was special.   IF you do not eat salty food, make sure that you tell server to reduce level of salt.   I tried Ikura combo, my boyfriend tried backed salmon combo, and my friend tried pork combo. Ikura was fresh and did not have smell but for salmon combo, rice was bit too hard and did not match with his noodle."}
{"text":"My sisters and I chose ramen for dinner before our show at the Ed Mirvish. We were craving quick, delicious and traditional. Unfortunately we were not impressed. We arrive to the resto and it was full, we had to wait to be seated as they would not seat us until our whole party arrived. That's 1. We sat down and our party was five. The waitress say us at a table of 4 expecting us to squeeze 3 ppl onto a booth seat versus offering another chair. That's 2. We ordered our ramen and the menus didn't seem as convenient as other Ramen places. That's 3. When the ramen arrived the portion sizes seems smaller where there should be a size up for the price but not the large. That's 4. The service was non existent. The waitress rushed us with taking our plates sooner than she should. That's 5. The ramen wasn't anything special. And neither was the gyozas. The taste was mainstream ramen. The atmosphere was crowded and the presentation of the dining room was nothing special to bark about.   Overall, I would say I wouldn't be going back again."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 - Pretty decent.   Service 3.5/5 - very busy but the employees are somewhat responsive. The place is very tight the circulation was badly designed.   Price 2/5 - probably the pricey-est ramen place I've been to yet"}
{"text":"Pretty good soup noodle could be better, but it was super fast. I was starving last night. So I guess it makes everything tastier than it is! Haha..."}
{"text":"The ramen is good here I'm not gonna lie but from a value standpoint, it's disappointing.    Let's start with the positive, I like how you can downside or upside your ramen for $1 less or more respectively. What I didn't realize was, if you downsize, your meat also gets downsize!!! When I got my bowl of ramen, I can't help but stare at the one and only piece of meat in my bowl.  To make matter even worst, half of it was fat.  I was just at kenzo 2 weeks ago and I paid the same price $12.96 for a regular size that came with 3 big slices of meat that also came with half an egg.  Which I forgot to mention, egg is extra $1.60 at Santouka!! So needless to say, my $14.56 small bowl of ramen looked very pale compared to the Kenzo ramen."}
{"text":"Best ramen in the city hands down! The broth is so consistent every time. They have only 4 main types of ramen - each of them is so rich, flavourful and just delicious."}
{"text":"Four because of the 30 min wait with no chairs !!! Poor feet ! Came here after a fun day of walking  Downtown on a very hot day. Anyhow the food was Great!! Its comfort food for a cold night for sure. Very filling and flavourful indeed! The meat was obviously stewed to perfection to match your soup base. Had the Shoyu ramen with the Pork Jowl (Toro -something) a MUST TRY. Would come back on a better waiting condition."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen place in downtown. A bit of a wait for seats (~25 minutes on a Friday around 7) but well worth it. There is little waiting room indoors so if it's super busy, you'll have to line up outside.  The seating is pretty crowded so I wouldn't recommend it for big group gatherings.  I like the classic ramen the best - but ask for less salt if you have a lighter palette.   Santouka has never disappointed me - the ramen is always so flavourful and perfect for a cold winter night."}
{"text":"Great food always busy, ways a line up but totally worth the wait this place has a great turn over the food comes to pretty fast always hot and flavorful everything is always fresh one of the best on ramen"}
{"text":"It's a high probability that if you're reading this review, you've either heard about this place, or you googled \"best ramen in Toronto\".   Luckily for you, this place is the real deal. My stomach has done the work on your behalf, trying most ramen shacks this city has to offer. Having just come from Tokyo a month ago, I can safely say their ramen brings homage to classic, Hokkaido Ramen.   They are known for their Shio Ramen, but since I'm a meat lover, I usually skip to the  Tokusen toroniku ramen(Ramen with roasted pork cheeks). The broth is extra hearty, but a little salty  for me the first time. Pork Jowl is so good, and incredibly moist.   I've since learned you can request specifics, so I always ask for less salt, and for my noodles to be a little firm and chewy. Order an Asahi black beer to wash it down. It's the perfect combination!   Conclusion? It's definitely top 2 in the city."}
{"text":"over all the best ramen in toronto. The broth is just right, not too heavy and still full of flavour. Ramen has a good texture. The service is fast. over all a good ramen experience."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends while on a business trip to Toronto. This is a popular spot, we had to wait for 30min or so on a Sunday night. The service is super quick, the turn around is fast. I ordered the spicy ramen with soft boiled egg, the broth was very well made, the right amount of thickness, saltiness. The large one was a bit too much for me, I think regular size is fine unless you are ridiculously hungry or a big water."}
{"text":"I have no complaints about this ramen place in terms of flavors; broth is rich and noodle texture was very good. However, their staff should really get some common sense and customer service training... ASAP. We were a table of five people and ordered 80 dollars of food, my girlfriend was the last to order and decided to share with one my friends who ordered a bigger portion. We were condescendingly and repeatedly told that each person has to order a Minimum of 9 dollars per person. I told the server that we ordered way more than 9 dollars per person already after which she proceeded to ignore me. We decided to split a previous order so that my girlfriend had \"ordered\" 9 dollars   Needless to say i was not impressed and made a scene. I told her that I wanted to speak with her manager. Luckily the Chinese manager guy came out and had some common sense to Apologize.   Seriously,  the waitresses here should improve their English skills to conversational level so as not to panic when resolving a conflict... Have some common sense not to ignore a customer who is visibly upset with something which does nothing but escalates discontent, most of the time a simple sorry would have resolved the issue ... Also the 9 dollar rule is important but so is common sense : 5 people times 9 =?????? Drum rolls 45 which is less than?????? Drum rolls 80 !!!!! For my life these people have much to learn in terms of customer service... Look at sansotei which has a much more cramped physical space but somehow manages to provide good service .... Again ..... Have some Common sense ... Also some Improved English skills would help"}
{"text":"It was so nice to have some good Ramen in the dead of winter in Toronto! We came here right as it opened and there was a tiny line but once the door opened we were ok, got seated right away. Very great service! We got the spicy ramen with a side of Kim Chi and Gyoza. The broth of the ramen was just right, I love it flavorful and spicy! This hit the spot. Small location, but super cozy."}
{"text":"What to eat when you visit Toronto?  Ramen.  Hands down Toronto should be a ramen lovers destination and Santouka should be in the top of your list.  Just down the street from Dundas Square sits a small traditional ramen shop.  We were greeted at the door and shuffled (in a nice way) to the bar, my daughter loved sitting and watching them make the ramen. The sounds of chaos, the smells of pork broth, and sights of noodles being cooked it made me very happy. I ordered the spicy miso and my wife the plain miso while my daughter wanted the pork and rice bowl.  I want that broth again, I want to have that broth on hand at all times. The richness of the miso, the spicy edge, and the savory pork made this a knockout.  I am not sure what else to say, there really isn't a negative in my mind.  We all finished our bowls, we slurped, we barely talked during our meal. Man I want that broth again."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite ramen place. I usually get the kara miso combo with their chashu gohan.   Ramen: The kara miso broth is super tasty. Their noodles were great. The chashu was perfectly fatty. I really liked the pickled bamboo shoots in the ramen, as a clarifying note through the richness of the broth and meat.   Chashu Gohan: Rice is perfectly cooked, a little sticky but not too wet. The scallions on top were refreshing and provided a little crunch.  The store is pretty small, and there is usually a wait for peak times. Try avoiding the bar area, since it's connected to the kitchen: it gets pretty warm sitting there."}
{"text":"First attempt at SANTOUKA in downtown Toronto! Kara Tsuke-men in spicy soy sauce flavour is amazinggggg  for me the spicy level is somewhere I can tolerate! Other than the fact that the ramen was a bit dense or plastic-like kinda texture(?) the spicy miso soup base is very good  we ordered extra portion of noodles so the noodles in this picture is not the regular portion. Pork, egg, bamboo shoots, green onions are also added to the soup just like regular ramen."}
{"text":"This is by far, THE best ramen place in Toronto for me! The second best would be Sansotei ramen which is not too far away. I had their signature shio ramen which had rich and flavourful broth and a nice balance of textures: thinly cut pork topped with sesame seeds, shredded mushrooms, bamboo shoots, scallions, and perfectly cooked noodles-- I suppose in Italian terms, \"al dente\". I'm not a fan of their dumplings which are too flimsy and flavourless for me, but there is one interesting dish of salmon roe served on steamed white rice. My husband ordered it as a side and I took a few spoonfuls. I would not get one for me though, because the ramen is already quite a lot to handle. I felt myself getting full even just halfway through the bowl. The place is small and quickly gets packed, so it's better to come either after lunch time or before dinner which would be around 3 or 4pm. I don't mind sitting at the counter where I could see the huge cauldrons of broth and the chefs expertly doing their thing, unmindful of my prying eyes. There's nothing fancy with the place but I guess that's how it is in Japan. Besides, all I'm after really is a nice hot bowl of ramen goodness!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite place for ramen in Canada, and I've tried many other ramen places since I'm a noodle person. I come here every time I go to dt. I've tried many dishes and none disappointed me. Some of my friends say that the soup is too salty, I can agree to that but I didn't mind it that much since the flavour is sooo good! I just drink a lot of water The size wasn't small but I think the price is a little bit more expensive than some other ramen places? Also try avoid peek time cuz the line is usually very long, sometimes I had to wait in non-busy hours too lol   (One point I like other than food: they have baskets under each table so that you can place your handbag or shopping bags there so that you don't have to squeeze it behind you)"}
{"text":"My mind was blown yesterday as far a ramen noodle soup goes... I'm far from an expert for judging ramen, however, up until I ate here I had only eaten these delicious Japanese noodles at Asijan Ramen -which I thought were pretty good until now haha.  Just a stones throw away from Dundas Square, the location isn't bad at all if you live in the heart of the city, but I ventured from Markham to try this place out and it was worth the effort. Inside it's actually a tiny place but the decor was nice and clean. Washrooms were decent for public washrooms. The servers were super friendly and took care of us well.   I forgot the name of what I ordered, but I think it was number 4 on the menu, spicy miso ramen or something like that. I added the egg and some seaweed.  You have to add the half boiled egg!!! So good!!!   This place lives up to the good reviews it has- check it out!"}
{"text":"i've been coming here a few times now and this is the 1st time i'm leaving a review for this place. like the previous times, my experience here had been mediocre at best.   i've tried their fish roe combo, salmon combo, and the pork combo. each time, the rice bowl was flavourless. the salmone specially was dry, tough and fishy, and same as the fish roe. The pork bowl was just salty in general.  i've only tried the spicy ramen and it did not meet my expectation. broth was salty, very few toppings, and the noodles tasted processed.  i'm surprised that this place is usually crowded...there are better ramen spots like ramen isshin (college and bathurst) or kyouka ramen (queen e)"}
{"text":"One of my fave ramen places in Toronto - bright atmosphere and neat food presentation gave it extra points. Convenient location, efficient customer service, clean and spacious atmosphere, and most importantly - good food.   Although the broth might not be as rich as that of Kinton or Sansotei, which might be the only downfall, the food quality is nothing less than these two. Ramen was nice and chewy (portion size may be a wee bit smaller than usuals). You also don't get to 'customize' your noodles or broth as they are pretty set on what's on the menu. What you see on their menu is what you're gonna get (maybe you'll get to add an extra egg or two, for extra of course).  Seating for Japanese places are in general smaller, and although this is no different for this restaurant, you do get a bit more arm space between the next table. As opposed to Kinton and Sansotei which tend to have a darker decor (literally), this place is pretty bright with natural lighting (glasses all on one side of the wall) and a bigger lot, which I personally like, especially in good weather.  Presentation of the food is also quite nice. They serve your ramen on a small tray, as opposed to just the big bowl. I personally thought this was more eye appealing, and neater. Price is generally the same as other ramen places, more or less $10 per bowl. Considering the food presentation here, it is a bit more... 'gourmet' than your usual, casual ramen places; it's a different experience.  There's a lot of mixed reviews for this place, which I'm surprised about; best is to try for yourself!"}
{"text":"Service was good and quick. I tried the Winter Special Ginger Ramen and it was quite nice. However since I like extra spice in my food, I had to add chilli oil. All in all it was a good experience and highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Make sure your entire party is there before seating! They don't write names down or anything so you have to just wait there in line.   The staff was very friendly and attentive, which was appreciated. Though it's unfortunate we couldn't write our names down, we actually got seated pretty quickly even though it was a long line. Our food also came out relatively fast.    The food: it was really good ramen but not out of this world or anything like that. The broth was very flavorful (we got shoyu and kare miso) for both of our soups. Lots of noodles as well! However, we got the upgraded bowls (which adds $1) and only two pieces of meat. I thought that was a little surprising because usually ramen restaurants provide more meat than that, plus the meat was a little too fatty for my taste. We also got hard boiled eggs but had to also pay extra for them.   In my opinion, the food is a little pricey for the amount of food you get but it is still tasty."}
{"text":"The place is small but welcoming. I usually see it packed. The kitchen faces the tables so there is a warm and friendly atmosphere.   The prices were OK. I had a combination of large Ramen (1$ extra) with a starter and side. The side was salmon rice. The rice was cold and dry, the salmon was also dried, meaning that they don't serve it fresh.   I was quite happy with the portion size, worths the 1$ extra, however there were only 3 pieces of pork. For extra pork you should be paying some more $. The service was quick.   One detail got my attention; they give you a basket for your bags so that the bags don't touch the floor and that they could remain clean. Clever.   I actually want to give this place a 3.5 star rating, doesn't deserve 4, but isn't 3 either."}
{"text":"Top 3 ramen joint in the city! Most complex, layered, somewhat rich broth out there. Always packed, so be prepared to line up. Love the Shio Ramen, my go to bowl. Get the extra noodles and gyoza if you are feeling really hungry."}
{"text":"Food: Yummy authentic Hokkaido ramen! Love! Ordered the shoyu ramen and it is sooo good. The cha-siu is very tender and chewy. The flavour comes quite head-to-head with Sansoutei. I can't remember if you can decide between thick or thin noodles. (I always get mine thick anyways)  Service: Everyone is nice and welcoming. Only thing which sucks is that your entire group has be present in order to be seated because there is limited space inside. :c The space is really crowded so careful not to bump elbows with the person sitting next to you.  Decor: There are even single booths where you can see the chef make your ramen. Halloween is around the corner so they had cute paper pumpkins around the place.  It's pretty good, but I'm still loyal to Sansoutei. Will go back though!"}
{"text":"If anyone has been to mitsuwa in San Diego the taste is very similar (bowls are similar as well) where the meat is a little more fatty here and able to customize the saltiness and amount of lard. Only problem is that the salmon bowl combo I had the salmon was salted and way too salty after the ramen.   Also not much veggie options.   I've never had a combo for ramen and regret getting it but this time the grilled salmon rice bowl destroyed the five star meal. Will go again and try another combo next time."}
{"text":"This place is cute. It was really busy, but we had reservations, so we got a table.  The place is small and it felt a little too jam packed, so I was happy to have a window seat where I didn't feel overly claustrophobic.  If I had been sitting at one of the central tables though, I think I would have a much different opinion of the place.    I don't really understand all the fuss about ramen. It is okay, but it doesn't rock my socks.  I had the Shio ramen and it was pretty tasty though I had to drink a ton of water after the fact.  I guess I would recommend this place to someone who really digs ramen, but for me, I won't be back."}
{"text":"This was our first official ramen restaurant and I wish I was more impressed. We found that this place had one of the best ramen in the city so we gave it a try. We were put off by the taste of the ramen with a particular aftertaste and weird flavoured noodles. Also we found that the prices were on the higher side compared to an average ramen restaurant (we spent $40 with 2 ramen and an order of gyoza).  On a positive note, the service was fast considering it was a full house."}
{"text":"If you are ever in Toronto you have to go here for the best ramen you will ever have.  Authentic menu options and the most amazing staff to take care of you.  It was the best ramen meal I have ever had and I can't wait to take a trip back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and tried out the shio Raman. It's located a bit off of younge and dundas square.  Coming here Monday (dumpling day) is a great idea since your order comes with an additional 3x gyoza for free!  Raman here is great, though comparing differences between Santosei, Kinton, they are all at the top - the only difference is the minor differences between saltiness, taste, and portions. However, place is still preference. The portions here are smaller than the others.  At the end the bill came to $12.37 - not bad!  It is with coming here for the Monday special as oppose to other places.  5/5"}
{"text":"This was the very first ramen place I have went to with my boyfriend. We beat the line up before it got too busy, the place is small but such a nice vibe! Yummy broth with nice portions and it was super quick!"}
{"text":"This is a popular place! I came right at opening time at 11, and there were already several people waiting for the doors to open. It got very busy very fast. I love miso ramen, but was tempted away to try the spicy version, Kara Miso with pork jowl (toroniku). Do not be alarmed by the warm red-orange color of the broth: you will definitely feel the heat, but the spice level is perfectly manageable, and the whole thing is delicious. (Just take care that the broth doesn't accidentally go down the wrong tube; that's not fun.) This bowl doesn't come with egg, so order that separately. It's a bit on the expensive side, but good quality. Service is fast and friendly, and servers will happily answer questions and make recommendations if you ask. Only four stars overall, though, because there are virtually no vegetarian options aside from a soup-less ramen salad, which means I cannot come here with my partner. I know that good authentic ramen is anything but vegetarian, but it would be nice to have something palatable on the menu for herbivores."}
{"text":"Flavor and atmosphere wise speaking, this place is amazing. I went to santouka in Vancouver before and the experience is similar, though I'm rating them 4 stars this time because of its price and portion of food.   For a quick lunch, I ordered the gyoza and spicy miso ramen, which I will recommend to anyone coming to this restaurant. However, the price was a bit expensive for the quantity of the food I received. I paid more than 20 bucks, but left the restaurant felt there was still room in my stomach. If you want authentic ramen, this is the place to go. I will go again, but this won't be my top choice to go."}
{"text":"So, I don't know what the hype about this place but it definitely did not meet up to my standards. Personally, I don't find ramen that appealing anyway, but wow... so I ordered:  1. Shio Cha-shu ramen - very very salty, the pork was dry and it just wasn't anything special. Nothing to rave about. I'm just happy I didn't have to wait in line since I got there early.   2. Shoyu ramen - layer of grease, both bowls were nicely decorated  3. Ikura bowl - the best. simple, the salmon eggs were full of flavor and juicy!  Overall, I would not come back."}
{"text":"First time I went there, I hated this place. Second time I went there, it was alright. Their shio broth could be better though, but it's not that bad. Some people swear by this place and sometimes there are lineups, but I can't say I'm a huge fan of it. My fav place in the city is either Kinton or Ajisen. I would say it's one of the better options for ramen in the area, but by no means the best. Check it out for yourself to make up your mind."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick lunch. Service was A+. Got my ramen in less than 5 mins.   Spicy Miso Ramen was delicious!  Broth was super rich and has so many flavours with a hint of fish. The Roast Pork fillet was super tender. Love the saffron they put on top of the noodles. Perfect weather to have this ramen.  Pro tip:  If you like your broth to be less salty, you can ask the server for less salt."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasnt been said before.. This IS the place to go for Ramen.. Best Ramen shop in Toronto, ON. I always order #14 as my usual favorite. Pork Jowl (pork Cheek melts in your mouth) and the combination of the chewy noodles with the fatty pork broth just works wonders....  Tried the Green Tea Cheesecake here and although it is a heavier cheesecake (unlike Japanese cheesecakes or Uncle Tetsu) it is still very good....  However, if you want Ramen where everything (i mean everything) imported from Japan and Ramen cooked to perfection, I wouldnt think of missing this place..."}
{"text":"A good 4  They serve the same soups and combos than in any other Santouka throughout the world, so that is a solid place!   In my opinion, soup:ramen size is too small and noodle are too much on the instant noodle side, as compared to some other places around, but still... this is a sure ramen place.  However, there is no way I am to line up for more than 5 minutes to go in a ramen place! I went there at 4PM and did not line at all. When there is a line I go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was the first traditional Raman soup place that I have ever been to, and boy was I impressed. First off the waitresses were all very friendly and attentive. The prices for the food were also quite reasonable.  I went with my fiancé and friend and the two of them ordered the miso flavoured Ramon while I got the soy flavoured. I really enjoyed the broth from my soup and the noodles were cooked perfectly, though I had wished there was maybe a little more pork. Even so the soup was very flavourful. The miso soups I was also told that they tasted great. Lastly we got an appetizer of dumplings, they were very tasty bit nothing out of this world.  I would easily recommend this place to others, and will add it to my list of restaurants to go to when I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of Santouka when I was still living in my home country. When i heard that there is one in Toronto, I was so excited and believed that I must pay it a visit. However, the experience was terrible...  First, there was a huge line up inside the store. It was extremely crowded and I did not understand why didn't the staff give customers a number. The store was small and dark, staff were not smiling and friendly. At the time I got into the restaurant, it was already 9pm. My boyfriend and I was not very hungry so we decided to get one ramen and one dumplings, which is 10.95 plus 5.5. However, the staff told me that, at the end of the menu, there is a policy that \"minimum order of each person is 9.95\". so, okay, fine, we decided to choose a combination of $14.5 plus dumpling 5.5, which gave a total of 20. Ridiculously, the staff told me that even if the total is $20, the 2 items must be at least 9.95 each. I must order more to qualify and meet their \"policy\". My boyfriend and I did not really care about a few bucks, but the whole policy is insane.   1. the store did not show a sign at the entrance saying that the minimum charge is 9.95, it is like a fraud, a lie. The policy is only written at the back of the menu, at the very bottom, with small words.   2. it is non-sense that each person has to order at least 9.95. If we would like to try the 18.95 combination (includes a rice, ramen and salad), we still have to order another ramen (lowest price 10.95) to meet the requirement. The restaurants is forcing people to order more than they need, which is totally unacceptable. If customers only want to have a sake or a dessert, they could not meet the requirement. It seems that everyone must have to order a lot in order to eat in this restaurant.  3. The minimum charge is way too high - $9.95. A ramen costs 10.95. Thats mean you must at least order a ramen.... There are many restaurants which has minimum charge, but they never set it so high.  We finally ordered one ramen, one rice bowl and dumplings. The food does not taste like the original Santouka! Soup is a bit tasteless and the portions are so small!  I will never visit Santouka again and i will warn my friends about it. I prefer Sansotei/kinzo, people are nice, soup are thick and tasty, and it does not has such crazy policy."}
{"text":"Santouka is my favorite ramen place of all ramen places I've been to in Toronto. Sure I could fly to NYC or other places in the world, but what they offer is the most consistent and tasty ramen in the style that I expect.  What I like eating here is the Tokusen toroniku.  The toppings: pork jowl, bamboo shoots, seaweed, scallions are served separately so that you can adjust to your liking.  The ramen is chewy and substantial, and the broth is wonderfully creamy and tasty.  The pork jowl is tender and fantastically seasoned.  In addition, when you're really hunger, the ikura gohan is a tasty side of salmon roe, shredded egg and seawead on bowl of rice.  I am not big on lining up for food, so when the line is 5-15 minutes it is worth it.  I would not lineup an hour for something simple like ramen."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying service was bad. We got sat and never got served for 10 minutes. The two tables beside who got sat AFTER us got served before we did... We had to call our server in order to get served. We didn't even get water... We had to ask for it.   As far as food goes, it was pretty good! We got the cha-Sui spicy ramen. Three stars for that! Soup was flavourful and noodles were cooked perfect! However, we were talking to the table beside us and he got a large bowl of the cha-Sui ramen when we got small bowls. The server offered them a small or large bowl but yet, we didn't even get the same offer... And this was the same server. Small bowl was enough to keep my satisfied but I would have gotten the large for $1 more.  Overall, food was good but service was horrible... And yes, I changed it to bad to horrible after writing it all down."}
{"text":"6/26/15:  Awards adorn the window, including \"Best Ramen\" of 2014.  That's really what got our attention as we passed by multiple times.  Finally we found some time to come by, but unfortunately when we got there there was a line out the door and past the side.  I tried to put our name down, but was instructed to just wait in line and they'll take our names then.  Well, I was a little irritated at that point, but the wait was worth it!...  1. Ikezo Sparkling Jello Sake C$9.25:  Totally amazing.  The flavor is as you would imagine, yet the texture is amazing!  It's sweet and sparkly as you would expect, but the amorphous liquid is magical!  Somehow it is a liquid, but yet it's jello at the same time.  I LOVED this stuff--totally am on a mission to find it at a local Japanese grocery store now!  10/10  2. Shio Cha-shu Ramen C$12.80:  Pretty dang good.  The noodles they use are the curly kind, and are cooked correctly.  The soup is pretty rich, and I would say pretty balanced.  Personally I can never get enough flavor and I think a totally melted pig would be amazing, but I think most would find this flavor level pretty good.  One BIG problem: their cha-shu pork is REALLY hard.  I dunno what the deal is, but it's pathetically under-braised.  Not good cha-shu.  Oh, and one notable thing is that they have tons of different little extras like various slices of seaweed, veggies, and soy-bean based stuff.  If it weren't for the crappy pork I'd give a higher score, but as is... 7.5/10  3. 31) Aji-tama (Soft-boiled flavored egg) C$1.60:  Nice soy sauce flavor on the egg white and correctly creamy, dark orange, yolk.  8/10.  4. Toroniku Kara Miso Ramen C$16.40:  So this is their special version, and the menu implies they may run out.  I guess when we came we lucked out and were able to get it?  The main difference between this and their standard cha-shu version is that they replace the braised pork with a plate of pork jowel (hog cheeks).  And unlike my Shio Cha-shu Ramen, this pork is WONDERFUL.  Very tender and melts in your mouth!  My gf got the hot version of the soup, and yeah, it's pretty dang hot.  She loved it, though noted it might be a tad salty, though personally I thought it was okay.  Anyway, this is great stuff!  9/10  Great ramen place!  #canada #ramen"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better ramen places that opened up lately. The line is pretty crappy though and there seems to be no way to eat there without waiting for 45 minutes.   Their menu is surprisingly big with rice and appetizer and what not, but we stuck with the tried and true. All of us got a Ramen each, with the two of us getting the spicy one (Kara Miso). We asked for it to be as spicy as it gets, but it didnt end up being very spicy but rather enjoyable. Honestly though, I dont know if i'd be coming back in spite of the yummy flavours here. There are plenty of good ramen shops nowadays without the wait and considering this chain is worldwide, i might just be better off trying it elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Location: About a 5 min walk east of Dundas station. You'll see the line-up! Due to the small lobby area (which is good for 4-5 people), people will be lined up outside.  Decor: The restaurant is small with seating for 8-10 people along the bar facing the kitchen and about 16 spots in small square tables packed tightly together. Be prepared to friendly with fellow diners :)  Food: On a cool fall day, we decided a bowl of hot ramen would be perfect. I've been to several of the other spots (Kinton, Raijin, Aisjen, Kenzo, Sensotei, Sonoyama, Ryu) so I have a pretty good comparison. First thing you noticed is that the speed - the waiters give you about 1-2 mins before asking if you are ready to order. Shortly after we ordered, we got our food in about 5 mins - I think it was record time (plus this was a Friday!). We also noticed that menu had these small rice bowls and combo meals (ramen plus a rice bowl) - this seemed like a nice touch if you were extra hungry. We ordered the Ikura combo with Shio Ramen and Tokusen Toroniku Ramen - this also new as it was pork jowl (from the jaw) which I never had before. For the Tokusen, I loved the broth - great flavour and richness to it while the noodles were chewy and had great texture. I was a bit hesitant first about the jowl meat - was it a marketing ploy but after I dipped it in the soup and took a bite - my worry was no more. It was super tender and tasty but it was also not very fatty. I know others like pork belly but I find it was too much fat (I usually order pork should if there is an option). The jowl seemed like a great mixture of tenderness and flavour without the fat Definite hit! My wife had the regular Shio ramen - same comment as well -wonderful soup and noodles. We actually loved the Ikura rice - it was a nice side dish that we split - briny salmon eggs with shredded egg on rice - yummy :)!!!!  Overall: As you can tell, the food was a hit! Now - it is a bit more pricey for their signature Tokusen but the others seem reasonably priced. For a treat, I think it is worth it to try. We definitely return to try the other types of ramen."}
{"text":"Decently good ramen with many choices. They had reasonable options for extra sides and the ability to choose the ramen quantity and hardness.   Unfortunately, the hostess is not very competent for seating people when arriving in groups of 3 and allow a lot of people that are pairs through first. It gets frustrating when people keep passing your group when they arrive a lot later when the hostess can just hold off 30 seconds and seat 3 people instead of double pairs.  Overall it is a good experience and has fast service but annoying lines and bad seating management."}
{"text":"I went here for ramen redemption after my slightly disappointing ramen experience the night before (at Kiu Japanese Restaurant in Markham).   My coworker and I went around 12 pm and only had to wait for 10 minutes. The service was great, the waitress was attentive and quick to take our orders after we were seated but we did wait a while for our orders to arrive. But that's expected during the lunch time rush!   I ordered the cha-shu spicy miso ramen (large) with a side order of egg and gyoza. She ordered the spicy miso pork jowl ramen (regular). We love that you are able to customize how salty and fatty your ramen can be. I didn't change anything but the next time I go back I would ask for less lard and salt.  The chashu is fatty and delicious. I loved the soft boiled egg as well.  The gyoza was perfect and I loved that they provided vinegar and soy sauce for dipping. The spicy miso ramen wasn't spicy for me and I ended up adding some shichimi to add some spice.   The pork jowl was also delicious but a little bit on the salty side.   We were both extremely happy with our orders and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After waking up from a long nap, my friend and I decided that Ramen is best for dinner. We passed this place a few times and it's always full of people, so we figured it'd be awesome...it was! Their Ramen were a bit overpriced in my opinion, but it was worth it. Had the Miso Ramen and the broth was perfect! The noodles were soft and delicious and overall it was great! We waited about 10 to 15 minutes for a table and since it was a small restaurant, it was completely understandable. Customer service was great!"}
{"text":"Ramen joints litter the Church/Dundas area and picking the best one has been my goal.  Hokkaido is damn near the top of my ramen list.  We trekked to Hokkaido on a cold snowy day and the ramen warmed us up quickly. Service was good and restaurant was genuinely Japanese.  I had the Toroniku Shoyu Ramen which was outstanding. The broth was good but could have been creamier for my liking. The meat was cooked and simmered well and packed a good punch. Noodles were what stood out the most as they were not too hard with good chew. I find ramen places often have noodles that are too tough but not here - soft and chewy at the same time.   We also ordered gyoza which was tasty. It was not crispy enough but would suffice.  Price was expensive but fair. The portion and quality made up for the high price.  My recommendations: 1. Order from the premium ramens - they're worth it 2. Don't come here too often unless you're balling 3. Come hungry because sizes are liberal"}
{"text":"Greeted every time you come & leave, good service even though it's cramped in terms of seating. I only went there because my friend was hungry but I wasn't so I didn't plan on eating anything. But the people there said that each person had to buy a minimum of $10. So he got ramen while I got a melon float and toroniku. Not that bad."}
{"text":"Mmm... MSG! Certainly changed the recipe alright, less salt, more MSG. Damn I'm thirsty!  Is there such a place in Toronto where I can have ramen/noodles and not have to drink a litre of water after ??"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this more stars but all 3 times that I came her they were heavy handed with the salt which kept me from really enjoying the broth which is my favourite part!  Was jot a good feeling waking up the next day with the biggest salt quenched thirst."}
{"text":"One of my favourite things about Santouka is the option to pair your ramen with a small rice dish, which i almost always do.   I almost always get the combo of ramen with a bowl of rice and ikura. It's both hearty and satisfying and probably the reason why Santouka is neck-to-neck with Sansotei."}
{"text":"Love the food, hate the service & people. There is minimum order of $10 per person. I love the food, my bf hates it and he was not looking to order. Tried to order food and beverage for minimum of $20 but still not good enough for them. They want 2 full meal purchased."}
{"text":"Visited this place again last week and was pretty disappointed. To start, they asked our group of 6 if we were ok sitting separately. We said no, but after a 20 min wait they still sat us separately... Why even ask us if you are just going to ignore what we said?   Onto the food, which I had high expectations for after visiting the place a while back, was disappointing. The noodles were yummy and the pork jowl was tender, but the soup was wayyyyy too salty. For the price I expect a rich flavorful soup, not a bowl of salt water.   The only thing that saved them from 1 star is the al dente noodles"}
{"text":"A few months ago I spent weeks on end trying all of Toronto's well-reputed ramen joints.  I've spent a little time in Japan, as well as two and a half years in Los Angeles where ramen's huge, so good ramen's a must for me.  In the years I was gone from Toronto ramen really blew up here, but there's a pervasive mediocrity - hidden gems are few and far between.  Of the lot I tried I found some truly great options, but Santouka Ramen was far and away my favorite of the bunch.  Preferences in ramen often center around noodles, and Santouka does thin, firm noodles better than any other place I've sampled in Toronto.  If you like thicker and softer noodles, Sansotei Ramen will be more for you, but for my tastes Santouka's exactly what I want.  Their noodles are cooked to order, and always executed perfectly.  Their pork broth is rich and deep, without being fatty or greasy; it's divine, especially their spicy broth which quickly became my standard go-to order.  Their gyoza's amazing as well - fried fresh and crisp, each dumpling is browned to a light, airy perfection, lending layers of additional flavor to complement the juicy filling.  What's usually a re-heated throwaway app is a golden treasure at this place.  Service is fast, efficient, and polite.  Food arrives quickly and they'd like it if you ate and left fairly quickly - lines can get pretty long on the weekends.  But they're sweet about it, and god knows they'd never let it show.  I adore this place, and it's my number 1 recommendation for ramen in Toronto, Kinton be damned."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on our second night in Toronto.  It's right around the corner from The Bond Place hotel, so that was very convenient (we had walked around all day in the cold, so we didn't want to travel far for dinner).  It's not a very big place, and seating is a little tight.  But the good sign is that a lot of people were there, with more customers constantly streaming in.  I ordered a combo of ramen in miso with salmon and rice.  My boyfriend, Brian, ordered the ramen salad, which was a delicious surprise.  It's a plate of ramen tossed in a light sauce, with shrimp and tomatoes.  It was light and very refreshing - I highly recommend it.  Overall, we had a really pleasant experience.  The place is clean, and the staff super polite."}
{"text":"I order their spicy tsuke-men (extra noodles), and their shio ramen.  Spicy tsuke-men: 3.5 Their broth was okay. . . Nothing too special. However, I really did like their thick, chewy noodles. It was probably one of the thickest noodles I've had at a ramen restaurant in Toronto. It came with a whole egg, but I was disappointed that they were hard boiled. And for the price, it's not really worth it. I also don't know why it doesn't come with nori  (seaweed), since it's a tsuke-men (and it's pricey).  Shio ramen: 4 I wanted to rate it 3.5, but their broth was really good. Somewhat delicate, yet creamy and flavorful. And I really liked how they added white sesame to the broth. It goes really well. I also enjoyed their chashu. It was tender and very tasty. The biggest downside was their noodles. There was nothing special about their wavy, thin noodles. It was just slightly better (or if not the same) as the store bought ones.  Service was nice.    Previously, I've also ordered ikura (salmon egg) with rice. I would definitely not recommend it, as it tastes 'okay', but it was way too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Amazing service, although the wait was a little long because reservations aren't accepted. Quality consistent with other locations across Canada. Noodles are freshly made in store, and the meat slices served are satisfying: do order the double portion if you like pork, or order the menu option with a side of meat slices. Most interesting item on menu is the \"tsukemen\", which are cold egg noodles served on the side but dipped in the hot broth served separately. Only ramen shop known yo serve this type of ramen, special to the region of Hokkaido."}
{"text":"2.5 star  I would not line up in the cold ever to wait for a Santouka Ramen. The ramen is good but waiting for a hour? not really worth your while. For me, ramen is just a fast comfort food and if lining up in the cold for more than 10 minute, it is no longer a fast and comforting experience!  I was lucky as we came on a Sunday afternoon with just 1 family of 4 waiting for a table and we got seated fairly quickly.   The deco is simple and functional which is kind of comforting. Love watching the cooks at the open kitchen area busy preparing for the food. There are also quite a few seating for singles.   I tried the Shio Ramen, Miso Ramen and Spicy Ramen. I do enjoy the toppings: bamboo shoot, jelly ear and chashu. The broth definitely well flavoured with a savoury and sweet after taste. The only thing I don't enjoy is the noodle itself. The noodle has this overwhelming egg/soapy flavour that I didn't enjoy.  Service here is fast, efficient and friendly.  I would only come to Santouka only if there is no line... definitely not worth lining up for!"}
{"text":"I was here a few years ago and it was really great, so I was disappointed in the food on my visit for lunch this past week. I had shoyu ramen plus egg. The pork was fatty and delicious, although the portion was a bit small. Noodles were lacking the typical springiness.  What ruined the meal a bit for me was a hint of ammonia scent. Too much alkaline salt in the boiling water maybe? It was fairly off-putting."}
{"text":"The ramen here is sub-par compared to other places in Toronto. The taste is more bland, the potions are small, and there are fewer ingredients (no egg). Moreover, it's more expensive. The service also needs some work here."}
{"text":"Best ramen in the city, hands down. My husband and I love ramen and this is by far the best we've had in Toronto.   The only negative about this place is that, since it is pretty small, the servers are always rushing to get you in and out of there asap. If you're waiting in the cold outside I can appreciate that but if you're in a big group and would like to be there for a while this is probably not appropriate - except if you want to eat your food and go.   In spite of that, the ramen flavour is amazing and we love their green tea cheesecake as well. So good!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Ramen place in Toronto. This place is almost always packed and for good reason. Having lived in Japan for 7 years, this is pretty close to the flavours you'd normally experience. Prefer this place over Kenzo, Sansotei and any others you can name!  Definitely get the large size as the small one isn't that large. Have tried almost every type of Ramen they serve and they are all great. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good flavours, but long wait times and high prices. My friends visiting from Japan like the flavour but we all hate the prices.   I kind of just wanted to give 3 stars but their broth is worth coming back for, ...when you aren't on a budget.  Also, they sell Ikezo, which is a jelly sake that when shaken 10 times has bubbles that stay still. I shook it too much and made a mess so no good photo"}
{"text":"I remember coming here once when it first opened and not being particularly impressed, probably because I'd had to wait for a long time outside in the cold because it was winter. Haven't been back in years until recently, and I'm glad I gave it a second try. While it still didn't blow me away, I do think I enjoyed it more the second time around, having put my ramen palette through a bit more training since then.   As other reviewers have mentioned, I think the main negative for this place is the value/price. The menu is a bit confusing - they list the price of all their ramen and I think it's -$1 for a small bowl and +$1 for a large bowl. Either way, you're paying at least $9+ and the small portion, while it was okay for me, is definitely smaller than what you'd get at Kinton or Sansotei. You also have to pay extra for things that would normally just come with your ramen, like egg.... what? So things can start to add up quickly.  One thing I really enjoyed this time was the pork jowl which I tried for the first time. The meat was so soft, velvety smooth and tender and full of flavour, a wonderful addition to my meal. The first time I was here, I found their broth for the shio ramen to be way too salty, but this time I thought it was fine. Either they have changed their recipe or my tastes have changed.  Santouka doesn't really stand out to me enough to top my list of favourite ramen places, and you can definitely get better value (larger portion, same food quality) for your money at other places. Their pork jowl does stand out to me though, so I would return on those occasions when I feel like treating myself to a little extra somethin'-somethin' with that yummy pork jowl."}
{"text":"Awesome ramen. Great pork jowl. I love the ability to add more fat to the soup. All-in-all one of the top places in Toronto to appease that ramen craving. A must try."}
{"text":"Had a bit of a wait but well worth it!  Not a lot of choices, but I suggest...THE RAMEN!  We had the spicy version with pork cheeks. Spicy, rich and flavorful with plenty to stuff my belly!  Sake was good and we got out of there for under $100.  CANADIAN!  What a bargain!  If you're tired of shopping at the Eaton centre, walk a half a block away and have some great food."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times, and the place is always PACKED. I usually get seated pretty quickly as I always go by myself, though.   Like the location in Vancouver, service is quick if bare bones.  I always get the Toroniku Shio Ramen, and for good reason. The noodles are chewy, the soup savoury and full-bodied without being over-seasoned, and the pork jowl fall-apart tender with just the right amount of saltiness to bring out the meat's flavour."}
{"text":"This place was fine, but certainly not exciting enough to justify the lines. The menu is not very diverse, the food is good, service is fine. I guess people have the chain they fell in love with on vacation and now are excited to have at home? But still, it's a chain."}
{"text":"Over the past few years, there has been an influx of ramen restaurants popping up in Toronto, more specifically in downtown. One of them was Santouka Ramen , which opened its door in late 2011, and has become a pretty popular destination for a ramen fix. Santouka Ramen is a ramen chain originating from Hokkaido, Japan, with several international locations, so you do get an authentic taste of ramen here. After an event, my friend, and I decided to drop by for a quick dinner. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated, which wasn't too bad.   Santouka Ramen specializes in tonkotsu broth, and they have a specific method to get the pearl-colored Tonkotsu soup. Although, that sounded very tempting, I opted for their Shio Ramen (salt flavor) ($10.95) - our signature ramen which is mild and creamy soup seasoned with salt. Shio Ramen is our only ramen that is topped off with a Japanese pickled plum. There was also an option to add additional toppings for a surcharge, which I chose corn for an extra $1. Overall, it was relatively well-portioned, and there was a generous amount of perfectly cooked ramen noodles. The broth itself was light, and slightly creamy, which I enjoyed. Reviews have often stated that they found the broth to be much saltier compared to other establishments. However, I have been several ramen restaurants during my 2013 Japan vacation, and it was equally salty over there. I highly recommend Santouka Ramen for their ramen, and they offer quick, and friendly service. So next time you find yourself craving some ramen, drop by Santouka Ramen for some."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen and good service but the place is small so be prepared for line ups if you are coming during peak meal times.  Tables are also small and crowded together.    The ramen is very good though.  Broth is rich but not oily and the noodles have a nice dense springy texture.  I didn't get the set meal but thought it was a great idea."}
{"text":"Food 4/5 - Solid, filling soups, portions big enough! in the Menu 4 different soups and only! only 1 (ONE) vegetarian option!  Service 4/5 - lack of English compensated by quick service. All seats are hard wood so you wouldn't be there for long!   Price 3/5 - $35 for 2 Soups! no drinks!  Restaurant for one time use! It should be cheaper for the soup!   Will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"That's the real Mccoy!   That delicious wholesome slow cooked 20hr pork soup was something else. Line can be long but the staff are very nice to you so at least there's that. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Like its northeast sister locations in Fort Lee, NJ (Mitsuwa Martetplace) and Harvard Square (Cambridge, MA), this Santouka maintains the same high standards and quality expectations of top-notch ramen.  Their tonkatsu broth is rich, deep, and wonderfully satisfying; the cha-shiu roast pork is melt-in-your-mouth tender (well worth paying for extra slices) - a fantastically good  bowl of noodles.  My kids had the shio ramen and emptied their bowls; my wife had the special  Santouka ramen salad with shrimp which she proclaimed excellent with a tamarind-based dressing - a sauce that gradually crescendoed with building heat.  They also had a seasonal dessert special of chilled fruit jelly with mango and pears - so light and refreshing, like eating condensed fruit aromas!"}
{"text":"Originally when the ramen restaurants came over here, people thought it was more of a novelty food.  Overtime, more popped up across the GTA and York Region and has become a signature on its own.  Santouka is another wonderful addition to this growing trend.  I decided to go full blast that day.  After all waiting 30 mins to get inside in -1 degree celcius, I needed to reward myself and my cold empty stomach. I had selected Tokusen Toroniku Ramen  pork jowl (cheek meat) and the signature salted broth, SHIO.  Service was quick and not long after I had a heaping bowl of noodles and a plate of the pork jowl.   Analysis  Pork Jowl - The meat melted in your mouth and was soft (supposed to be simmered).  It was delicious.  Ramen - flavour and looks akin to egg noodles but with a thicker cut. Don't let it throw you off though it has more elasticity to it and makes it quire springy.  Shio broth - Very rich, they use a similar method of \"Crossing-the-bridge\" noodles. They have thin layer of lard on top which reflects the heat back into the soup.  Don't let the lack of steam coming from the top trick you that the soup isn't hot.  The lard will also coat the food making it very smooth.  Things I can kind of identify inside the broth. sesame, miso (something akin to it), green onion, bamboo shoots (menma). fungi (cloud ear) and salt. I drank every last drop of the soup.  Additional Information:  Environment: simply minimalistic design. Mostly painted black with natrual wood trims and furnishings to bring a slight contrast to the space.  Total seats, I counted while waiting to be seated, is 36.  Service: mosty new the people work hard but quite inexperienced with what they are doing and the menu themselves. When I asked if I am to soak the pork jowl into the soup before eating or not she couldn't answer me.  Weaknesses:  1. Where is my marinated egg? (it's supposed be staple, not extra XP  ) 2. Long wait times. 3. No take-outs (wanted to grab one to take home for my mom and dad) 4. Acoustics, lots of noises and loud greetings (read: yelling) from the waitresses (one yelled loud beside me)  Conclusion  Delicious place. I will go again in future but only if I have the time to wait around."}
{"text":"I adore the toroniku (pork jowl), and the thick creamy shio broth is my favourite in the city."}
{"text":"Ramen is an experience in Toronto that is getting more and more competitive by the hour. The race to make the best ramen in town is hot and I swear I'm at the heals of every restaurant opening, review and release. I want ramen like a sweat stain wants bleach (meaning I want it, don't need it to survive, but if I don't get it you might as well throw me out because I'm useless).   Okay, after a preface like that, lets talk about the ramen.   It's good. It's really good. The noodles are chewy and the broth is accommodating. But...there's a but... it's not the best in town.   Everyone talks about this pork jowl like its magic. Maybe I'm not sophisticated enough for it. I can't even write that last sentence without laughing.  They sat me at the ramen bar (thank you, I'm one person) but the service was slightly lacking. I was not asked if I wanted a drink, and when i finally wrangled one I had to wrangle a re-fill. I also had to wrangle my bill when I was done. So, basically, weird pork jowl and bad service.   Great noodles, great broth. But that doesn't make a great ramen joint."}
{"text":"This place is pretty packed on the weekend. But I suppose that's just a testament to the tasty ramen they have here. I had the tsukamen ramen, and this place is one of the few places to get it. Overall pretty good, but make sure you make a reso before you go!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the food. -1 for the fairly high prices. I got the spicy ramen with extra meat and upsized it too. Boy was it not not filling. Not only that but it's pricey for what you get. There are similar ramen shops in Toronto for cheaper. The broth was also a bit saltier than what I would've liked."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday at around 6pm and there was a short line up. We (partay of 2) waited for around 15 min with maybe 4 groups ahead of us which wasnt bad.. but when we came back out the line was like 3 times as long...  I got the shio ramen which was really good! Broth was creamy (but I've had creamier) and the noodles were nice and chewy. So far prob one of the best ramens I've had in Toronto. Only thing I didn't like was the meat. It came with two pieces.. one was fatty which was good but the other piece was a bit too tough for my liking."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick, filling dinner on a Sunday night and was not disappointed.  Like others have said, there is usually a line as the place is rather confined and small. Expect a 15-20 minute wait depending on what time you go.   I ordered the Shio Ramen and my date had the Shoyru Ramen. Needless to say, we were not disappointed by the quality of the food - the broth was rich, the noodles were firm, and the pork was buttery. I would recommend the Shoyru Ramen for more flavour.  Being such a popular place, expect to \"eat and go\" - they will hand you the bill as soon as you are finished and although they do not usher you, you do feel rushed towards the exit. Of course its all reasonable, and they do it with a smile!"}
{"text":"Excellent ramen. One of the best I've had. Only 0.3 KM from where I stayed. Can't be better. Had been there twice in one week. Great service. On a cold day this rules. The stewed pork was delicious. Getting it on the side for a single person, a bit too much food, in an excellent way. Since ramen is big here and in San Francisco, I have to give it a try and I went back again. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I don't know if I can appropriately review this place but I have been here so I figured that a review was in order, even though I never ended up eating anything. Unfortunately when we walked in and looked at the menu, we noticed there was not one vegetarian option. When I asked the waited if it was possible, he literally laughed and said they didn't have any vegetarian broth. I've read in a review that they do, but when I went here it was about 6 months ago and they told me they did not. I'm sure the ramen tastes good, but come on guys! It's not hard to just have a veggie broth too!"}
{"text":"Not going to lie, I just got back from a trip to Japan and I was kind of tired of ramen. So when my Santouka die-hard friends encouraged me to go with them to try it out, I was a little hesitant at first.   I ended up just ordering a grilled salmon rice bowl instead. It was pretty good but the salmon portion did not live up to the picture on the menu. Way too much rice for the amount of salmon they put. Thankfully, despite ordering light, my friend who INSISTED I try the ramen, gave me a really generous portion of her Spicy soybean paste flavor ramen and holy crap it was REALLY good. The texture and chewiness of the ramen wasn't too soggy. The broth was thick and rich. Some regrets for not actually ordering a bowl of ramen... but then again... it was a REALLY hot day.  Knowing the saltiness of ramen cuisine, I was also pleased with how frequently the staff came to fill our glasses with water.  It's a pretty authentic Japanese style restaurant too. The chef and wait staff are loud and greet you with the traditional Japanese welcome. The place overall is very compact and space-efficient.   Was a little irked by their rule that all members of a group needed to be present in order to be seated. The restaurant was not even busy, or close to being full! Just let us sit down and escape the furnace while our last friend meets us here :("}
{"text":"We were in training at a nearby hotel and one of the only redeeming qualities of said experience was the proximity to Santouka. We walked in around 11:30am because it gets packed around noon. The cooks and waiters greet you when you come in -- very cute. I ordered the miso ramen (about $14 after gratuity). You can probably tell that I'm not a regular ramen connoisseur based on what I ordered. In any case, the ramen and miso soup was very tasty and creamy. A little too salty, but I ate and drank everything except for the pieces of bamboo."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favourite ramen places. Having first introduced to this place by a friend, this is my go to spot when I'm craving ramen.  This place is really small so there is usually a line but its worth the wait.  Also pro tip, try to get/request a table away from the main entrance as the door tends to stay open due to the line so those sitting by the door tend to get cold despite having a bowl of hot ramen in front of them.  My go to order is the Chashu karamiso ramen with a side order of gyoza (dumplings) and an egg. If you're new to this place chashu= extra meat. The karamiso ramen is a spicy ramen made with three different types of chilies.  Not a fan of spicy things? The shoyu ramen, a soy sauce like ramen is just as good.   ps im 99.8% sure I spelled chashu wrong sorry lol"}
{"text":"the ramen is kinda boring here, their combos are good because i like variety and i don't want to eat just a ramen for my entire meal if i'm here by myself without anyone to eat with me; however their plating, the ingredients, the food pairings are uninspiring, i often get their ikura but it's not really fresh.   their broth is like seawater, it's purely salty without any flavours of pork or the expected essence of pork from their slow-brewed soup. they're famous and everything but that's pretty much it, i'd rather go to kenzo for the same quality but lesser price"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  Their ramen!! Personally, liked their shio ramen the best because it has a rich creamy broth that is not like other ramen places. Can really taste the milky cream texture of the pork broth.   Each bowl will come with two slices or pork so if you don't think that's enough, you can order the bigger portion sized one where they give you five slices of pork.   They are really quick to serve your noodles shortly after you order. So don't worry about the lines! Because mean comes out very quickly!  LAST TIP?!   This place doesn't serve chicken or beef so they mainly only have pork broths and pork slices!! The vegetable ramen is on their secret menu in the kitchen so that's the only other ramen that doesn't have meat. And the portion size relative to Kenzo is smaller because the bowls are smaller. The prices are also more expensive than Kenzo so be aware!"}
{"text":"There is lots of pay parking right beside the ramen place which is super convenient but approx $10. There's usually a line so make sure you aren't in a hurry! Turnaround is fast so the wait is not that long. The ramen is delicious ! The flavour of the broth is delicious! Very flavourful and everything you would hope a great bowl of ramen would be. I personally love the spicy ramen. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the price. The ramen here is a bit more expensive then your average ramen place however the ingredients seem to be a higher quality. I would not recommend this place to any vegetarians or anyone who doesn't eat pork because all the broths are pork based. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I'll add to the high ratings. One of my fave ramen places in Toronto. I was there opening night and have been returning since. Excellent service, good prices, broth and noodles are balanced and delicious, perfect texture, the portions are great. I always enjoy myself here. Sure there is a wait, but its worth it. Consistently good. Totally Fantastic."}
{"text":"This place has amazing ramen! Out of all of the ramen shops in downtown, this place has the richest broth and the softest chasu. The portions are smaller but one small bowl was able to fill me up. Great for lunch!"}
{"text":"Solid ramen. Probably one of my favorite meals in Toronto. Get the gyoza and a combo ramen and rice bowl and you will leave stuffed and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Their miso ramen is amazing. So creamy, so flavourful, so savoury and just so delicious without being overly salty. I asked for less salt because you can choose your salt level which I think is amazing! The noodle goes so well with the broth. The only downside is the line up and wait but once you are seated they greet you and when you're ready they take your order and less than 5 minutes he ramen arrives piping hot and ready to be eaten. I really like how they allow customization which I think makes this restaurant worth the wait."}
{"text":"This was our first meal in Canada and it was fantastic! We could not have chosen a better place for a dinner after our long travels. It is conveniently located and the people there are super friendly! My husband said it felt like he was back in Japan when he walked in. Our server was so nice and helpful. She recommended two delicious ramens for us, both with pork jowl. I don't think I could order anything else if I returned because my spicy ramen was just so good. She also wrote down the name of a couple of things for us to do while we are in town. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"We wandered in when the restaurant we wanted to eat at was closed. We saw this bustling restaurant and decided to try it. When an Asian restaurant is packed with Asians, I take that as a good sign. The menu is limited but gives you all you really could ask for in terms of ramen options. Overall for the price and value the place is great. My only dislike was that my broth was too salty for my taste."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen place so far over sansotei, kinton, kenzo, etc. It is located in a relatively quiet street behind yonge dundas square and eaton centre so it may be a bit hard to find at first. Every time I come here I keep thinking that its the best bowl of ramen I've ever had. I often change up what ramen I get but the consistency of the delicious rich and flavourful broth and the firm yet chewy noodles. Seriously, its so good. Service there is always fantastic, definitely up to Japanese standard. You get greeted enthusiastically when you enter and leave the restaurant. Servers are often very busy but remain prompt and friendly.   If you come here during peak hours, you'll likely find yourseld waiting a bit for a table, but definitely a shorter wait than the Sansotei nearby.   The only cons that caused me to take off a star is that the egg does not come with the ramen and has to be added on at an extra charge when the price for the ramen is already quite expensive. After tax and the 20% tip I usually give them, my bowl of ramen with no extra add ons or upgrades comes to around $16 which is definitely on the higher end compared to the other popular chains like sansotei and kinton.   Overall, it is still my favourite ramen place because of how good the ramen is (which is an understatement). However I don't come here as frequently as I'd like to because of the price. On a side note, I really wish that Santouka can open up another shop or two in the GTA as they currently only have one location downtown."}
{"text":"Santouka Ramen recently opened it's door back on Nov 10th, we went there within the first week and there was a line up already. We waited in line for about 45minutes since the wait staff was rather slow in clearing tables and you can see at least a few tables empty at all time. I was expecting it to be a soft opening with limited menu items but except for a few appetizers, everything was available.   Their tonkotsu style broth are made by simmering pork bones for two days and is paired with medium sized noodles that come from a factory in California. On top of the roast pork, toppings include fermented bamboo shoots, jelly ear mushrooms, cured surimi and a single pickled plum (chashu, menma, kikurage, kamaboko and ko-umeboshi)  Toroniku Shio Ramen $15.90 ~ Santouka's Toroniku Ramen comes with their special simmered pork jowl (cheek) toroniku meat and toppings which are served separately.  ~ I recommended Ben to order this since this was their signature dish and of course we tried the Shio (salt flavored) first since that was their most popular flavor but also because that's also the best way to taste the full flavor of the tonkotsu broth.  The broth was very flavorful, milky and dense but somehow not perfect (feel like something was missing) ~  Ben ask them for harder noodles which came perfectly cook but there was a slight soap-y flavor, probably due to the \"alkaline\" water added to the noodle for the springy texture. ~  I have to say that the pork jowl was melt in your mouth good, definitely my favorite so far.      Ikura (salmon roe) Bowl Combo $16.50  ~ combo comes with regular size ramen  ~I choose the Shio Ramen as well but somehow this soup taste totally different than than the Toroniku although both of them was Shio.... use different broth?!?  ~ This one was slightly denser, saltier and less flavorful. I have to say that I really like the added pickled plum on top which cut the richness of the broth a bit and love the amount of the other toppings (love the fermented bamboo shoot). ~ We didn't specified the hardness of the noodle when ordering and it came way too soft. ~  I would expect the Ikura to be cold served on warm rice but it was on the warm side which didn't make it taste as good (no burst of salty salmon flavor here). I will probably not order this combo again and would probably prefer to fill up on the ramen instead of the rice here.   Toroniku Kara Miso Ramen $15.40   ~ ($16.40 - $1.00 for small portion) ~Ben wasn't full yet and decided to order a small portion of the spicy miso to try but for only $1.00 less, the portion is a lot smaller. I find the miso a bit too salty for my taste and although we asked for harder noodles, it was definitely softer than the first Toroniku Shio Ramen we got.    Verdict : ~The broth here was rather salty which left me rather thirsty the whole night  Love love the roast pork here, definitely the best I had in Toronto but I still prefer the broth from Sansotei Ramen and the noodle from Kinton Rame better. ~ Wish I can have a bowl that combine all three... when is Ippudo coming to Toronto?!"}
{"text":"My favorite ramen, good service, very popular. Nice inside, but unfortunate location. Get the combo with ikura donburi."}
{"text":"There are several good ramen options near the Yonge/Dundas area- Raijin, Sansotei, etc, but I actually quite enjoy Santouka. Compared to the others that I've tried, the portions are a tad smaller (which is actually a positive for me), but the broth is extremely flavourful. The restaurant is quite small, meaning that there is often a wait (but better now that the ramen craze has died down considerably in Toronto). Turnover is usually quite fast (unless the restaurant is short staffed) so I haven't had to wait for too long. I would recommend Santouka for a fast, affordable meal- especially perfect for a cold rainy day."}
{"text":"Close by to my hotel, had to check it out. Ordered the cha siu ramen -- meat was uber tender. Broth was extremely well done. Might have to come back before I leave!"}
{"text":"Very rich flavour, without extra fat!  The ramen here uses a very tasty soup stock, which captures that rich flavour without having to add tons of animal fat. The portions are great for regular size, and you have the choice to upsize for $1 more, or downsize for $1 less!  Wait time is insane though. I went on a hot day, so there were only 2 people OUTSIDE the door, but that still took 15 minutes to get a seat at 1:30 pm on a Sunday."}
{"text":"The service is so quick it's insane! We ordered and received our ramen within 5 minutes.   However, they don't give much meat in their portions and toppings are bare minimum. My boyfriend ordered a large and only had 2 pieces of meat. The broth is good though!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time. Excellent service for lunch and seating is quick. Ramen is good quality and very tasty. Prices are decent for being in downtown toronto. I've never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"I've visited over a dozen ramen places in Toronto, Los Angeles, New York and Hawaii. So I'm now getting to a point where I can differentiate \"good\" ramen vs. \"okay\" ramen. (Really, there's no such thing as bad ramen)  The ramen here is flavourful - the broth has depth, the noodles are fresh and just the right amount of al-dente, the egg is perfectly soft boiled.  I had the Karamiso Ramen with Pork Jowl and with an egg. Truly, the star was the pork jowl - it was melt-in-your-mouth tender and delicious!  You really can't go wrong. But while this place shines at food, I found two things to be lacking, compared to its arch-nemesis, Sansotei, or really, other ramen places in North America.  1. Service/Atmosphere - Okay I get that it's popular and you must wait in line for at least 30 mins (even if you're just 1 person!), but once you're inside, there's that pressure to \"eat and get the eff out.\" Everything is super rushed, unbearably loud, and borderline annoying. There isn't that happy chatter or hubbub of a busy restaurant, it's just plain chaotic. Really, takes away from eating your bowl of ramen in peace  2. Affordability - $22 with tax and tip for one bowl of ramen. No kidding. Given #1, I really don't think this place can rightfully charge so much, despite the good bowl of ramen. That's about 1.5-2 bowls of ramen in comparable places.  So that makes for one delicious, expensive bowl of ramen, served with a side of screaming.  I'll come again if I crave that pork jowl, otherwise, no thank you."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Always come here when I am in town. Expensive ramen but well worth it. Highly recommend#8 if you like spicy."}
{"text":"I don't really like Japanese ramen because it's way too salty and my cheap mouth would rather eat a bag of instant shin noodles. But this has got to be the best ramen I had in my life, even better than the ones I had in Japan. The bowls are tiny but the portion can easily be increased with +$1. The broth isn't too salty and has a very pleasant taste. The meats are so fatty and yummy. The only downer would be the gyoza, which was only crispy on one side.   There was a long wait due to difficult table arrangements, single parties eating at a 2-man table rather than at the bar, etc. However, the waitresses were super polite and made sure to accommodate us as quickly as they could."}
{"text":"Tsukemen is my absolute favorite, so when I learned that Hokkaido serves it I was extremely excited to give it a try. Sad to say, both my boyfriend and I left feeling very, very underwhelmed. :( I believe he ordered the shoyu cha-shu ramen while I ordered the tsukemen and we got some gyoza to share. The gyoza is nice and crisp, and the texture of it was quite pleasant but I felt that the primary flavor was solely ginger. Admittedly, I am not the biggest fan of ginger but I felt that you couldn't taste much else in the gyoza. After having one or two, it felt a tad bit tiresome in my opinion.  When his ramen and my tsukemen came out, I must say that everything looked delicious and I was pleasantly surprised with the large portion sizes. However, both my boyfriend and I agreed that the broth could have been significantly warmer. Because it was not as hot as I was expecting, everything felt sort of \"stale,\" if that makes sense. I am not quite sure if it was supposed to be this way, but my tsukemen came with a hard-boiled egg, which caught me by surprise. I absolutely love ajitama, so when I broke open the egg to find it hard-boiled, I was surprised, confused, and honestly a little disappointed. :( All in all, I feel the overall experience just felt very lackluster. :( I would not be opposed to visiting Hokkaido again if someone invited me out, but I unfortunately have to say that it would not be my first choice for ramen again. :("}
{"text":"My go to ramen spot when I'm downtown Toronto and craving ramen. The broth, noodles, egg, and meat are all delicious here. My tip for ramen lovers is to add corn to your noodles- it makes the broth sweeter and even better!"}
{"text":"Best ramen in downtown Toronto Some might think it's a bit to salty but I would say this is what a traditional ramen taste like. The soup and egg is my favorite part"}
{"text":"Some fresh-cooked noodles, rich, savory broth, the perfect amount of spice, with a few slices of pork and a half-cooked egg!!  Love the texture of the ramen, was cooked just al dente and the texture was not compromised even until the last bite. That is not very common in most ramen place which by the end of the bowl, you often find noodles too soggy or salty soaking up all the flavour from the hot soup.  Customer service is always friendly here even though their lunch and dinner time could get quite crowded. Waiters always go around to ensure water were topped off and orders were fulfilled without long waits.   Although this lunch was slightly over $20 and te portion could be on the small side in North America standard. But the taste and quality of experience was definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"Love this ramen spot! Shio/Shoyu is my favourite + I also love to pair it up with the rice combos, very filling and hits the spot! Broth is very delicious, some may say it's a little on the salty side but I enjoy it.  The bad side is the seatings are sooo close to each other there is no arm space between you and a stranger. Can't really talk privately as everyone is close and can hear your conversations. Also lineups become very long that it reaches outside the door of the restaurant (it is worth it though in my opinion, it just sucks if the weather is bad.)"}
{"text":"When eating noodles, individuals have personal preferences, such as thick noodles over thin ones.  I so happen to really like finer noodles, therefore i was enjoying my ramen that came in a flavorful soup base.  The soup was supposed to be spicy, but i didn't find it to fit its menu description.  At $13.95, there were a couple of slices of pork, but mainly you are paying for the noodles and soup.  For an additional $1, you get a larger bowl, and for $1 less, you get a smaller portion.   Above all, be prepare to wait in a long line.  Is it worth the wait, you ask.  Hmmm..."}
{"text":"Decent Ramen albeit a bit salty.  Gyozas were fairly average compared to other Ramen places, ie. Kenzo."}
{"text":"This is a good friend's favourite but I think it is just okay.   I find the broth to be far too greasy - the oil slick in top of the broth is crazy! - and the fattiness coats your lips, mouth, and throat in a really unappealing way. I also find the broth to be crazy salty. Ramen is salty by default but this places takes it too far. The flavour of the broth is fine though - very porky and obviously cooked for hours. Noodles are cooked properly - al dente.   I had tsukemen for the first time here. Made me realize I don't like tsukemen because the noodles cool the broth down really quickly, which makes it taste even saltier.  The pork jowls are quite nice though, and a good differentiator from all the other ramen joints in the city - I don't think any other place serves the slow-cooked jowls. The flavour isn't all that special but the texture is - it melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"I like many others it seems have fallen in love with Santouka. This place is serving up some of the best Ramen that I have ever had and it really never disappoints. The lineups for Santouka can be very bad but with good reason, in a city that is full of garbage knock off ramen it only makes sense that when something is finally done right that people will be willing to wait a long time to try it and that exactly what Santouka is. The prices are great here and they do offer three sizes for their ramen. I have tried all sizes and in my opinion the regular is perfect."}
{"text":"After months of wanting to check out this place, I finally found an excuse and a group of friends to tackle Santouka with me!!  1) 40-minute wait in the cold... NOT COOL but not really their fault!! 2) Staff take orders on iPhone/iTouch... COOL!! 3) Smaller variety than in Vancity but COOL nonetheless!! 4) Cant speak for all items on the menu, but my shio cha shu ramen was legit! Authentic Hokkaido noodles and soup base... COOL!! 5) Aint cheap, especially when they charge you $1.50 for 1 egg or a pinch of corn (should only charge when EXTRA eggs/corns are requested, not when they start with NONE) NOT COOL!!  Now, been there. done that. Will only go back if I have another really good excuse, coz it just aint me to line up for food that I can get elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing tsukemen. Ton of soy sauce in broth and not enough bonito flavor. Noodles did not cling on to any of the (watery) broth like they should. Egg was overcooked.  Kara miso ramen - nothing special, not bad but not great  Tried spicy tsukemen last time and same issues.  This place is overrated af"}
{"text":"Had a craving for ramen again..So here we go: From few times coming here I felt the place was A-OK as my rating is..The wait was great, didnt have to line up as some other Ramen places.  Ordered The Ikura Rice Bowl and PJ Miso ramen combo. The Pork Jowl is decent but not good as the belly or shoulder that im used too.. Broth was average at par.  Had a green tea btw.  The bill came too $21.xx(Think it was somewhat pricy) , I think I could have ate better at other ramen shops. Anyways.. It would probably be my last resort for ramen for a while.  Cheers.."}
{"text":"It's probably my favourite ramen restaurant in Toronto! They are always always busy so most of the time we had to wait to be seated. But it worth waiting because their ramen is full of taste of the tonkatsu soup and other ingredients in it. I love the salmon don combo the most! It's just perfect."}
{"text":"Minimum charge per person is $10.00 not worth it. My friend is unable to eat pork and they had no vegetarian options. Stupid ass place got my ass up and left. Not enough menus for 6 people. Very small and crammed."}
{"text":"Where do I start with this place...  The fact that I visit here at least once a week? Or that I know a few of the waitresses by first-name basis? Or that I know when is that sweet spot where the place will have no line and offer the quick-in and out meal that is needed at times.  I've been to Santouka countless times and amazed that I haven't posted my review of this place yet. Every time that I hear that someone else went to Santouka, I know a trip is in order very soon.  This place is just good comfort food, especially on a cold day. Always go with the Shio or the Kara Miso. Flavorful and hearty, this place is a decked out chicken noodle soup (with copious amounts of lard). I swear by this place that it cures all sicknesses and ailments.   Service is prompt and turnaround is perfect. Some people may find it rude or they are trying to kick you out, but it really is just the Japanese culture with how they serve food. Japanese expect fast service and this place sticks true to their roots.   I know there's not much to this review on the food here but you just got to try it. And once you do, you'll be coming back."}
