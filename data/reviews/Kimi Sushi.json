{"text":"Had some light food while waiting for a friend, the owners are very friendly and nice. Had chicken udon which was good... I never had udon before so I have nothing to compare it to.... I also had spicy California roll which was very good and seemed very fresh. Lovely people, lovely place"}
{"text":"This place opened quietly just around the corner from me and after receiving their menu in my mailbox for the 5th time, I figured I would give it a whirl.  It's a small place hidden around the side of 260 Manitoba st, and is definitely more of a delivery take-a-way joint than a sit down sushi spot. It kind of resembles one of those sushi stands in the mall, except with a closed off store front surrounding it.  I was dubious so I went for it. Clearly no AYCE options, so I figured, after looking at the images around the restaurant and the menu, at least I'd be paying for a good a la carte sushi dinner. Nope.  I ordered COM11 - which was the sushi + sashimi combo (came with miso soup and salad). The soup and salad were standard, nothing better or worse about it, but the main course served to be disappointing. Sashimi portions were room temperature or warmer and the size of square Loonies. Not great value. The nigiri was mostly rice, and fish portions were about the same as the sashimi. The one positive was that the selection was salmon and red tuna for the most part - but again, not great.  I left hungry and feeling a little gyped. They do offer bimimbap and udon noddle dishes, but I don't think I'll return for now. It's the only restaurant in the area so they'll get business because of that, but before I come back I'd want to hear that their quality has improved.  Earcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Boy am I happy I found this place! I live right next door and the rolls are amazing!!!!! So delicious! I had the lunch combo with miso and salad plus dynamite and California roll all for around 13. I would have given 5 star but for that price I can get all you can eat at Ajai Sai!"}
