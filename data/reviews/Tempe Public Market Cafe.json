{"text":"I think some of the reviews on this site are a little harsh. The Decour is awesome sat outside and enjoyed a crispy chicken sandwich with a side salad and Sundevil Fries.  Partner had a Cuban. That was a very small line with about a five minute wait in our food came out very quickly.  There are always kinks to a new place. I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Long line to order & only one cashier. I know they just opened (two weeks ago) but they probably should've staffed accordingly to handle dinner rush. Looked last le the manager was under an incredible amount of stress & when we went to get our drinks the ice maker was out of ice & the iced tea container was empty. I was really hoping the food would make up for the LONG wait but unfortunately, food was just okay. I think I'll take my $80 & go somewhere else. Maybe wait a few weeks until service & food are improved."}
{"text":"Like others, we have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this new place for a long time. First impression as we walked in the door for lunch was amazing... LOVE all the ambient light! The \"vibe\" of the place both interior and exterior is just great.   In our group, we ordered the Cubano Sandwich, a pizza, chicken salad sandwich and the Sun Devil fries. Everything was great! Does it cost more than Carl's Junior to eat lunch here? Uh... yes. But this is  not Carls' Junior... this is a well orchestrated gourmet eatery.  I don't do a lot of reviews... but these guys deserve a shout-out! I am really surprised at some of the harsh reviews I read. Obviously, these people have never experienced a \"first-day\" event at a restaurant. They can be really tough as there is no way to know how many people will show up. The kinks will get worked out quickly and this will become a \"go to\" place in Tempe for a long time to come.  Keep up the good work guys! Having a better than expected turn out for an opening is a good thing!"}
{"text":"Took forever to even order. Needs to have both registers open to have the lines move faster. They are probably losing customers from the line taking too long. Trying to be like Joe's Farm Grille but failing horribly. Ice machine didn't even have ice. Food was overpriced for over cooked French fries and greasy, sloppily prepared food."}
{"text":"My husband and I were very excited to try Tempe Public Market for dinner and arrived around 6:00pm on a Sunday. After waiting in line for 30 minutes we got to the counter to place our order only to find out that both items that we wanted (Crispy Chicken Sandwich & Southwestern Pasta dish) had run out. It was very disappointing, especially since it wasn't even late but prime dinner time. We love the location and the patio but if they run out of certain items they should let people in line know. The ordering process needs to be streamlined. We saw lots of people turn around and leave after seeing the line. I ended up ordering the cheese pizza which wasn't amazing. If I had wanted pizza I would have gone to a pizza place."}
{"text":"The place looks great (awesome patio and nice atmosphere) but disappointed a lot on discrepancy between price and service and quality. Food quality is average and you have to wait most of the time in line for ordering or later to pick up your drink, which might be ready only after food. At the same time you pay as much as in full service restaurants. Not so likely to come back for more than a drink or coffee."}
{"text":"Went there today for breakfast around 9am.  The place was about 30% occupied.   Great - no lines.   Ordered a simple breakfast item with eggs and potatoes.  Took more than 20 minutes to get served!!!  Food tasted bland and boring.  No flavor.  Lesson learned.  Next time I'll go to Wildflower or Panera."}
{"text":"Food was OK...... but the employees seem much more interested in socializing with each other rather than assisting customers.  We returned an item to be heated up and 20-25 minutes later it still did not return.  We asked one of the waitstaff to check on it, and she seemed indifferent to help us.  Overall, very bad customer service."}
{"text":"This place was a little too hipster crowd for me. The food looked good and was decent, nothing to blow your mind. (We got nachos and I got the chicken sandwich) The style of ordering and having no real server doesn't really work when you sell alcohol. I guess for lunch but not so much dinner."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this out. Unfortunately it's a very bland experience all around.   I will say, buildout is nice.  Great patio away from the traffic, good spacing between tables and nice atmosphere.  Also, good happy hour pricing on specific beers.   The bad, food couldn't have been more bland and amateur.   I will say we ordered only one sandwich, the chips and salsas and a few cocktails, that said, these should be spot on if you claim to run a kitchen.   Chips and salsa - no salt, cold chips.  Extremely unflavored salsa, seriously nothing there. Tomatillo was no better.  Guacamole was mushed up Avocado with no other spices.  I'm telling you, we have never had a more bland experience with chips and salsa.   I ordered the Cuban sandwich, my go to judgement sandwich.  It was $13 and the worst Cuban I've ever ordered.  It was a panini I could have made at home,   on a bad night.  Seriously something we would have done with lunch meat and bread from frys.  Even the mustard was flavorless.   Drinks. Like I said, beer was a good deal.  Cocktails didn't do it.  Sangria was bland, with no fruit and in a low ball glass!  No presentation or flavor.   The Lee Trevino was good but again, in a low ball and tons of ice.   Keep in mind this is based on an app and one sandwich but these were a great entry point and it didn't go well.  There is no value here, no flavor, no experience and no reason to get food.   Go here for happy hour drinks because the ambiance is great.  Just eat before your get there."}
{"text":"Remember the Campaign slogan \"It's the Economy, stupid!\" ? Well, in the case of the new Tempe Public Market Cafe, \"It's the Patio, stupid!\"...... whoever designed and decorated the Patio here was a genius. It's gorgeous. Name me another restaurant in the 85284 zip code where you can sit outside and watch the setting sun during our amazing early Spring evenings? The chosen corner was brilliant. .... which goes a long way toward explaining the onslaught of customers in TPMC's early days. Certainly it is not for the food or drink. Overpriced. Skimpy portions. Average. A good example is the Pork Verde Pot Pie. Sounds amazing, right? Especially to Az patrons. For $11.50, it should be the size of their large white bowls - not the same size and tin foil presentation of a $2 Banquet Pot pie from Fry's. It tasted good, yes. While it lasted. .... The lesson here is that Tempe could support about 5 more restaurants like this - the crowds show we're starved for just this kind of ambience, and women will keep dragging their husbands here- at least initially- for this reason. But the minute a huge ugly Apartment complex goes up on the NW corner to block that setting sun and spoil the esthetics? The prices must come down and/or the food and method of service change, or *this* \"South Tempean\" will head back on over to Espo's- reliable fantastic Mexican food reasonably priced and-oh yeah- they now have a great patio as well."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of going to the soft opening of Tempe Public Market and Cafe Wednesday. They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner. Staff was friendly and the menu had great options! Salads were yummy and filling as were the nachos! The baked sweet potato wasn't my fav but all in all not bad! The atmosphere was amazing, very open and modern. The outdoor space was beautiful with plenty of seating and a huge inviting fireplace for our beautiful AZ evenings! So happy to have a new place to enjoy some good eats and drinks! Definitely going back again !!"}
{"text":"I have been there three times.  Each time I have walked down, as I live 1/2 mile away. South Tempe needed a place like this, expectations are high. Each time I've been there, the line was extremely long, and only one register open. I get it that the kitchen can only work so fast, but..........people would rather wait SEATED AT A TABLE than STANDING IN LINE!!!!  Open the second register!!!  EVERYONE in line is extremely frustrated by this!!!  Like I said, if I'm waiting 45 minutes or longer from arrival to food, I would feel much better sitting at a table with the rest of my party than standing in line feeling frustrated seeing a closed register. OPTICS matter!!  Next comes the fries (Sun Devil fries). Get a new fry recipe, or at least make them as good as they are described on the menu. Soggy, undercooked fries sloppily thrown in a bowl, a little crushed garlic thrown on top, and a sprinkle of (I think) parsley, and a few shreds of Parmesan. When I see chili, parmesan, garlic fries, it would be nice to taste all of those things. If they are done right and full of those wonderful flavors, you don't need dipping sauces!  I truly believe, you put out killer finger licking fries and people will come!!!  The winner so far is the crispy chicken sandwich, awesome!  Cubano was also very good....a tad stingy on the meat but still good. Quiche was flavorful but serving size was almost embarrassing. Pizza just ok.....I prefer a thinner crust. Green chili pot pie was pretty good...too much of one distinct seasoning, perhaps chili powder?  Biscuits & gravy were really good, as was the frittata. Bloody Mary's were also very good!  Wait staff is very friendly and helpful. Patio is great, inviting, dog friendly......a lovely place to relax and be thankful we FINALLY have a neighborhood restaurant!  So with a little tweaking (fries fries fries!), more efficient ordering (more sitting and less standing), a few details here and there.......I know I will get to a shining 5 star review!!!  Thank you for giving us all such a lovely gathering place!!"}
{"text":"THANK YOU for coming to Tempe!!! I was there on opening day, and probably because I've experienced each of chef Chamberlin's other restaurants, I was expecting a crowd. So, of course, it was a packed house! It's an OASIS in the desert of south Tempe, where such creativity is sparse. So, yeah, people will be excited when it opens up, DUH!!! I wanted to hold off on a review until I had been there more than once & I've been there a couple times since, so...  A little note about the Presta coffee they serve, because this one caught me a little off my guard this morning: I almost never drink coffee without some kind of milk or cream. If I do, it's because I ran out. I tried it black today & it was so good, I actually opted to forgo the cream on all 3 cups! If you're a cream or milk person, try this coffee black beforehand & you may surprise yourself.  I had the Rice Bowl on opening day and it was DELISH! Also, the Flanshed Flarney Garney is so easy to love, it's a no-brainer. I'd recommend it to anyone, especially if you're a breakfast lover. Or, if you just like food. Or, if you breathe air, you will likely be someone who enjoys it. It's my fav thing on the breakfast menu. Also, treat yourself to a vegan cookie, even if you're not vegan. You won't be sorry & it won't make you a vegan, I promise!  This patio is such a great place to hang out; it's cooler than 98% of resort pool areas in the valley. I can ONLY believe this was previously a Circle K because I saw it before. The transformation is awe-inspiring. I love how the demolished concrete was integrated into the planters and the fireplace. All of the redwood built-ins are gorgeous! They should win an award for how cool the building is, not to mention for transforming an entire intersection. I can't wait to see the ripple effects this has throughout this area."}
{"text":"Had breakfast this AM - blue corn pancake + espresso - with a friend who had a GF muffin & we were both very pleased with our food, service & seating by the outdoor fireplace which had a healthy fire going at 8am.  Promised to come back here after my dismal experience 1 week ago (earning a 1 star review from me) & hope that was just an unfortunate fluke that won't happen to anybody again. Back up to 5 stars again!"}
{"text":"Slow service, food good but pricey for what you get. I believe chips and salsa was 10 dollars.  They had 2 registered but one open with long line and plenty of people working.  Service management needs work!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  After so many great meals at the PHX location we had high hopes for this spot.    Disappointing and flavorless food.  I won't be back to this location"}
{"text":"I was first very excited to learn this new and trendy restaurant is opening up in our neighborhood. But the food quality is average with very few healthy options. The ambient is great though."}
{"text":"Back again. I love that you can avoid the counter by sitting at the bar. Service was good. Ordered the AZ burger medium, side of fries. Fries delicious as usual. Took quite awhile to get food, because they were cooking the medium burger I ordered to very well done with no seasoning. I had to sprinkle salt on every bite, and I never add salt in restaurants! The supposed \"cheddar\" on the burger was a sprinkling of grated cheddar that didn't cover any but the very center of the patty. Seriously? You can't get a nice slice of cheddar to cover the burger? I see you've eliminated the 2 grapes rolling around on the plate (after all the complaints) and now it's just an orange slice. Oh, and ONE measly pickle for an entire burger? McDonalds gives more! I know you know how to produce quality food at a fair price. You're just not doing it now. Hope your taco joint is better."}
{"text":"Stopped by Tempe Public Market at 8pm on a Friday night. I was crowded but there was still open seating. Ordered quickly but the wait for food was 20 minutes. No free cookie with Yelp check in like they have at the sister restaurant. What's up with that?! My salmon was not over cooked and my veggies were fresh and delish! I like the vibe with open patio/bar with fire place. Nice addition to the East-ish Valley!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try Tempe Mkt. on Monday 3/19/18 for lunch.  It was busy mostly people in their 30's and 40's, the place was clean and bright, but the noise level would rival Buffalo Wild Wings. We found it to be trendy, a little pricey, a place that Yuppie's love. The food portions on some dishes was hefty and on some quite light. We tried the Rancher-sausage and pepperoni pizza-$16.00, when the girl set it on our table we both looked at each other like \"What the heck is this\", it was a cross between thick and thin crust, which was fine, but the size was small, maybe 5\"wide by 10\" long, a little bigger than a personal pizza in a regular pizza restaurant, even in a Yuppie restaurant $6.00-7.00 would be tops for this little guy, it did taste good though. My wife and I are seniors and I don't think this type of restaurant is our \"Cup of Tea\"."}
{"text":"Well, we had high expectations for this place. Always hear good things about the one in Phoenix. Since Tempe, is seriously lacking good places to eat,we were very excited to check this place out. If you are on your lunch hour at work forget it ,you will never get your food and get out on time. 30 min we waited for our order. The place is very crowded,but, mostly with people that are waiting for their food,for a very long time. We came a little after 1pm,thinking the rush would be over. I know that they just opened recently. It seems as if there is a lot of folks working here that maybe have not worked in a restaurant before. What might help is if they take orders at the table. Watching the staff run all around the place,inside and outside while looking for the table for the the number  has to be exhausting!  They have been open for a few weeks now. So they should be getting it together.We will give it another try, but it will be awhile."}
{"text":"Two words... RIP OFF. I get it. It's trendy. Cool architecture. They play down tempo indie music. The ingredients are indeed high quality but... Where's the food!?! SKIMPY portions yet high prices. $11.00 for a \"superfood\" salad in a soup bowl? Let me see, Literally 1 ounce of the following; Kale=cheap, Quinoa=cheap, Broccoli=cheap, Almonds=cheap, Sweet Potatoes=cheap, Avocado=OK I'll give you that one... Hey, that's worth $11.00! NO! Don't get me wrong, I love a healthy meal, but the opportune word here is meal, not snack.    The wife had the AZ burger. It too was $11.00 and then $4.00 for a 3\" bowl of fries. Yes. $4.00 for a CUP of fries. Have you ever been to 5 guys? Their small order of fries is $2.99 and more than enough to split. I know, not necessarily an accurate comparison, but again a very inexpensive item to produce. I digress. Back to the burger... The brioche bun was good. Did someone break in and steal ALL the spices? Bland is an understatement. By the way, my son had the kids cheeseburger. Same size as the AZ, patty, very little cheese, and bun. Half the price. Equally as bland. There were 2 pickles though...   Lastly, we ordered green tea, a cold brew iced coffee, and an espresso. The tea and iced were actually very good! Hence the second star. The espresso on the other hand was no joke the absolute worst we've ever had. Bitter, acidic and a mere sip for $2.50. Let me clarify, I make espresso every morning at home. We do not drink coffee. We know espresso. That was not espresso! That was just nasty.    In conclusion, bland, overpriced food. Good tea and cold brew. Horrible espresso. Good bread. I think they should scrap the menu (or at least half the cost of every item) or go exclusively baked goods. Buy some real coffee beans roasted by someone who's actually tasted good coffee. If you like this type of place/food, save yourself some money and go to Modern Market on Ray road. At least they feed you and there's some flavor..."}
{"text":"We ordered the Breakfast Burrito and the Devil's mess, early on a weekend with some drinks. The service was prudent, pleasant and patient.  Both our meals were delicious and the drinks were tasty if a tiny small. The price was good for what we got and we are overall very happy to have a tasty and beautiful place in this area."}
{"text":"$4.00 for a small bowl of greasy re-fried French fries is crazy.  The crispy chicken sandwich was average and not worth the price.  My stomach is already aching.  The ice tea is really good!   Not worth the cost."}
{"text":"The food is decent, although I would recommend not putting fancy cheese on a kids burger, it wouldn't kill you to use some cheddar or American. I just can't get behind the self-serve thing, it feels so strange and unnatural to have to get up from your table and walk to the bar every time you want another beer."}
{"text":"Great food! The green chile pork pot pie is incredible! It's a great spot to bring your dog and grab brunch, too! Really great for any meal! The only reason they don't get five stars is because they still haven't quite figured out the service- long wait times and some clumsy food runners. All in all I will go again but I hope they figure out some of those growing pains."}
{"text":"This is indeed my new favorite neighborhood resturant! Great feel, wonderful service, the food is spectacular, full bar, indoor and outdoor eating options, sports bar design, and amazing vegan options! I love this place!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the neighborhood! It is such a great atmosphere, with the inside, outside, and bar space- staff is so friendly- and the drinks and drink selection is great. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the food is really good, but not great. My favorite thing on the menu by far though is the rice bowl. And I have only been here for lunch and dinner but not breakfast. Everyone really has to go here and check it out!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place, yet after 3 visits, I walk away feeling over charged for mediocre food and poor service (at the bar or counter). The patio is great. Just wish the food lived up to the price."}
{"text":"So, I went here with a group of guys. We had a reservation, and were seated right away. The staff here is very friendly and helpful. We all had a great time. When I went to order my food, I was greeted by the manager, and I told her that I was torn between the crispy chicken sandwich and Tito's cubano. She said they were both awesome, so I got both, to share with my friends. Both sandwiches were really good, however the winner in my opinion, (and it was unanimously agreed upon) was the crispy chicken. The cubano had great flavor, but the bread was slightly over cooked. I had never been here before, but will definitely be back again. The atmosphere was great, everyone said their food was really good, and good times were had by all."}
{"text":"Nice and clean establishment. Clean healthy foods. Location is a bit confusing but once you go once, you'll be fine. It's in a college student dominated are but I see people of all ages go!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since it is very close to our house so I met a friend there at 6:30pm for dinner midweek. The restaurant was fairly quiet and there was plenty of seating outside which was nice. The patio has a comfortable atmosphere so it was great to sit outside. The menu prices are a bit expensive but we both enjoyed the roasted cauliflower dinner. Unfortunately, there were a few things that kept them from getting five stars. First, the food took quite a while to arrive after we ordered at the front and we had to ask someone walking around if they could check on it. We didn't have a dedicated server and I feel like that could help improve things if we did since they could take ownership of the tables. Second, my friend tried to order another lavender drink and they had run out. Third, they were out of the ice cream we wanted so we ordered the sprinkle one instead but they forgot about it. My friend went back to the counter after waiting 15 minutes. I really think these things could be improved if the tables had someone looking after them. Not sure yet if we'll give it another try since there are so many other dining options out there."}
{"text":"Update. I went back and had the chicken sandwich and It was AWESOME!  It was good. But not special. I was hoping for more  I probably should have gotten the chicken sandwich. There were like 6 sitting in the pick up window. But no, I had to ask the lady taking my order what she thought was better. Anyways, the pot pie is good, mine wasn't hot and flaky, and the filling is a green Chile base that I normally like, but I found myself missing the creamy gravy like sauce of a traditional pot pie.  Also had the Cuban sandwich which was average, and the cheese pizza for my kid. It was also average."}
{"text":"So had the fried chicken sandwich with fries, a cookie, a soda and a coffee to go. The food was very good but would say slightly overpriced. An add-on of fries or a salad should not be $4 when just the sandwich costs 10.50, $2 would be more appropriate, but whatever.  Also, the flies are ridiculous. They are flying all over the food and desserts. I don't know what can be done about it but it's gross man.   The seating in this place is nearly communal. Half inside and half outside. What the heck are they going to do in the summer? They will lose half of their seating as there is no way anyone can sit outside, especially with the poor overhead coverage.  Parking overall is poor as it's limited. It's going to get worse when Ghost Ranch opens next door."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Highly recommend the salmon special. Lots of vegan, vegetarian gluten-free & dairy free options. Great selection of fresh made pastries!"}
{"text":"We have visited TPMC four times now.  Opening day at 1pm. They ran out of food. What a fabulous problem on opening day! We were excited to return.  The next visit was for breakfast,(before they could possibly run out again) the next lunch and then dinner.  We love the atmosphere and the staff is friendly and efficient. I'm afraid we were disappointed each time with our meals! Perhaps our anticipation of this cool new dining experience gave way to high expectations?  The first meal was  Feb 16th. I had the quiche with a side of fruit- $10. My friend had the Devil's Mess- $9.75. She didn't finish hers. I asked for extra sauce for mine. We both decided it was \"just ok\"and wouldn't order it again.  The second visit was soon after the first visit. (on President's day) and they were busy. I had the chicken salad sandwich (curry based) and I was very excited. The sandwich alone was was $11! I added a small bowl of fries for an additional 4$.  The flavor of the chicken salad was very good. However the chicken portion was so small that the 9 grain bread overwhelmed the flavor and I was once again disappointed. The serving of fries was small, overdone and flavorless. I let it go because the staff was very busy. My daughter had a pizza and was satisfied. My son in law had the quiche with salad and was still hungry. Now, thinking 3rd time would be a charm, and now they've had a couple more weeks to pull it together,  we made plans to give it another shot. We went last Saturday night for drinks and appetizers. My sister had Chips, salsa and quac for $10. A friend had the chicken quesadilla, I wanted the pretzels but they were out (7:15pmish)  so I ordered Eat the Rainbow. The quesadilla was a hit. The nachos were overpriced for the amount received and we all enjoyed the unique veggie plate but the serving of dipping sauces were only half filled and scarce. So.... we want to love this place! We want to find something there we crave and can't wait to go back for,  but haven't found it yet.  Thanks for the awesome environment and Kudos to the wait staff, but I'm not excited about anything I've tasted yet and I swear I am not super picky. I'm a flight attendant for 32 years. I've eaten all over the world. So far, your selection does not warrant your prices. Other friends have said the same. \"High prices for subpar food\".  We don't want to be mean. We want to challenge this new establishment to do better. We know you can!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute. You can tell they put some money into making it inviting yet trendy. That's about where all the excitement ends.   We arrived about 7:30 on a Saturday night. It was busy but not crazy. Two groups in front of us - group of 4 and group of 6.... It took 25 minutes to take their orders...I wish I was kidding.   While we were waiting I hopped over to the bar to grab a beer. Beer selection is sad. Who doesn't carry Dos Equis lager? Also, the hefeweizen here is probably my least favorite one. The bar staff was okay if that means you have to ask for a glass and an orange wedge, also I'd suggest not tossing the receipt and pen at your customers ( or anyone that you've just met for that matter).   We grabbed a seat and waited.. and waited. Our food took about 45 minutes to arrive. I ordered the special pizza on the board margarita and my dinner date had a burger.   My pizza looked like the kitchen is either a. lazy b. Ran out of food or c. The restaurant is loosing money. Heirloom tomatoes are wonderful however not when they are the cherry variety and cut in half. That nice mushy seed guts all over is not appetizing. I also found it strange that instead of slicing the basil it was thrown whole leaves randomly on top (a whole 4 leaves). Just yuck. Sadly it was also close to flavorless. The whole thing missed it's mark.  My dinner dates burger was not cooked to the requested color and served with room temp fries. He asked for the green chilies on the side... They were served cold.   Also as mentioned in other reviews here the staff looks lost and wonders around. This place needs some serious intervention!! Someone save it!! It's so cute on the inside and the patio looks lovely!! Maybe just bring a packed meal?"}
{"text":"The Tempe region, especially around ASU, has transformed wildly over the past decade. Its southern part also has experienced a similar transformation - but quieter and and organically. Tempe Public Market Cafe is one example. With generous open seating areas suitable for family with kids, to a bar area that blends in nicely to cater to adults who just want to unwind, this place hits all spots."}
{"text":"I was so stoked to have Tempe Public Market Cafe open so close to me - only 2 miles away! Hooray! South Tempe/West Chandler are really lacking local restaurants with nice patios, indoor/outdoor spaces and local fare.  So, when TPMC finally opened, I was pumped! Hooray! Let's do this! Well.. I guess that I have to say - so far - I have been let down.  I went to get out of my house on a nice day, to use the wifi and grab a bite for lunch. I had a coupon for a free cookie as it was opening week, so was happy to use that. I looked over the menu and finally decided I am going to do the chicken sandwich. Ok. Well to start - the prices here (well at least for the fries) are more expensive than the downtown location. I have already choked at the $3 that was being charged in addition to the sandwich downtown because these are \"full-service\" restaurant prices with no service. But $4 for fries? Ug. Hard pass. On with the chicken sandwich.  Presentation-wise the sandwich is beautiful. Nice big hunk of golden-brown battered chicken on bun with some slaw an pickles. Looks delicious. Cutting the sandwich in half - the chicken is juicy. Now - on to the flavor. Wait - what flavor? The chicken was juicy, the breading crispy - but there is zero flavor in the breading. Zero flavor in the beautiful slaw. The only thing that made this have flavor was the butter pickles. Completely disappointed.   Well, suffice to say - the cookie was the same. I am one of those strange people that likes the dough better than the chocolate in chocolate chip cookies, and once again, there was zero flavor in the dough. Just completely missing something. As I am desperate for an awesome bakery like LGO around here to offer some semblance of a delicious baked good, neither the flavor, nor the size of the cookie suffices in comparison.  Service - well, I sat at the bar, and the staff seems very young and green. A bit clueless I have to say - drinks empty, no silverware delivered, no question of how my food was - asked for drink refills and silverware, finally ended up reaching over the bar and getting the silverware myself. Had to ask a second time for refill. Observation is not their skill set as of yet. Had to flag them down again for a box - twice.  The space itself - inside and out is beautiful. I love the patio - just needs more chairs - or tables at the long bench behind the bar. I am wondering what will happen come summer with the west side of the patio being unshaded, but so far, so good. Great patio space for sure.   So, once again for now, I will continue to my non-local (anymore) Four Peaks for delicious food, beverages, patio, and service as I have yet to be impressed by TPMC. I'm sure I will go again sometime in the future, but for now - I am going to go where I get an all-around better experience for the money."}
{"text":"I was so very excited for this place to open. It is literally what we have been waiting for in our neighborhood. I invisioned this being our \"watering hole\" and would have many great breakfast, lunches, dinners and happy hours. I visited twice before I made my final judgment, although the 2nd visit was better, I was sad to know this was not as pleasing of a place as anticipated. Coffee is just not good, I tried and tried. The process is not explained and I was not aware I had to pickup coffee at the bar. 2nd visit, I was listening for my name, food came out in parts about 5 minutes in between. My coffee still had not arrived, I did not hear my name called because its LOUD and I was only a table away. When I inquired they said, \" take Melissa's, I bet she took yours.\" Melissa soon arrived looking for her small coffee that I was given and I had ordered a large. Plus coffee taste bitter and should be something that brings you back for breakfast or stop in and pick up before work. Food: 1st visit was Quiche, it is over priced for the portion, not very good and cold. Coffee bad. 2nd visit with son and friend from out of town....biscuits and gravy were very good, no sides with it, but good and made the price worth it. Sons granola and yogurt dry with a ton of granola and little yogurt. Although a good amount of fruit, cut them in to bite size, they are generous big chunks.That's an easy fix. Frittata, over priced, especially when you have to pay extra for the basic side that most breakfast include, potatoes. I am more dissapointed because I feel we have to settle for a mediocre  establishment and would not dare to gamble paying for an over priced dinner just to be dissapointed. Maybe I was to excited and may have had high expectations for such a phenomenal location and patio. When the food is excellent, price is worth it. I see this as a possible happy hour spot during good weather in a nice patio on 1 or 2 occasions. Have not tried their drinks yet, that can't be dissapointing, fingers crossed. That will be my last effort before I give up on this place."}
{"text":"quite pricy and food served cold and not anything special it's the typical food you could find at any other restaurant and considering it is near a high school it definitely shouldn't be serving sandwiches at a high price"}
{"text":"I used to go to the Phoenix public market all the time so I was excited when Tempe was opening. I was more than disappointed with my experience. The chicken sandwich was cold, hard, and tasted like it was sitting out for 20 minutes. My mom's chicken salad sandwich had bones in it and she chipped a tooth when she bit into it. There was no service at all besides a few bussers walking around. Just a giant line you have to stand in just to order your food and for the price that is ridicoulous. I even had to get my own drinks. The ice machine was out and they had a little bucket with a little scoop to scoop your own ice. Thats very unsanitary. When we told the staff about what happened, they simply said \"sorry that happened and I will tell the chef to look for the bones next time.\" Really?? Good drink deals but I can not see myself spending money here again."}
{"text":"Hello, Everyone!   I've been waiting for this place to open for EVER! Let me start out by saying the overall ambiance is exceptional! The lighting on the trees outside is beautiful! Unfortunately, the line and the process to Oder is a complete NIGHTMARE! I stood in line for over 25min to order the Chicken dish with mash and Spanish, Pretzels w cheese sauce, and a grill cheese. My Pretzels were over baked and not worth the $$, however, cheese sauce was flavorful but a little too grainy, Chicken & Mash meal was mediocre, and my sons grill cheese came with no side and honestly it was just average. As a matter of fact the cheese was a little hard. In addition, I had two IPA's that costed me $15 in total! Are we in Scottsdale?? I'm not sure if I'll be back. Maybe only when I have guests in town on a beautiful evening I'll take them here to sit on the patio and have a few domestics. Overall, the restaurant is great for my area. I just hope business stays steady after all the curious hype is over and when people realize the overpriced menu for what you get."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for two Bloody Mary drinks, ordered at noon on a Veteran's Day.  Was told by the bartender, \"Well, I'll be out of commission for awhile,\" while sighing and ambling about his work.  No thanks! Sorry buddy, sour grapes about a day off, much...?"}
{"text":"You know that overpriced underperforming trendy breakfast/bakery place that everyone raves about?  That get all the hits and the friend chooses for her birthday brunch?  Yes, this is it.  Food was ridiculously over priced, 10 bucks for 2 eggs, 1 piece of burned dry toast, 3 decent pieces of bacon, and two very small BAKED potatoes.  In their defense the jam was decent, and they must have anticipated the dry toast and sconebecasue they give you a decent amount.  Who gives you baked potatoes for breakfast?  4 bucks for a scone? Maybe if it was good, and didn't need a lake of water to choke down. The Sahara called and needs their dry back.  You have to get your own drinks and utensils and napkins, and of course you get the obligatory stare when you don't include a tip on the receipt when you order and pay at the counter, because the only service they provide is actually bringing your food to you.  Run to a real breakfast place. May this type of do nothing overpriced average joint be quickly confined to history, that no one ever has to study."}
{"text":"I'm so confused about why my experience seemed to be so bad compared to the other reviews. THE FOOD WAS AWFUL. I'm upset I wasted my money! I just do not understand. However, the service was good. The staff was very attentive.  The decor is nice, the patio very inviting, I liked all the plants and the huge fireplace. The inside was extremely noisy.   The menu sounds great, but unfortunately, the taste was quite the opposite. We ordered a BBQ chicken pizza, a Cubano sandwich, and a couple drinks... over $40 bucks.   The BBQ chicken pizza features chicken sausage, ok I can respect going out of the box, but the menu did not say chicken sausage. The pizzas are served in a rectangular baking pan which made the crust soggy, almost steamed like. I did not taste or see fresno chile or cilantro, I'm now wondering if they didn't complete our pizza. The BBQ sauce was ok, very sweet. Seriously, a frozen pizza is better.   The Cubano, wow it was ssssoooo bad. The pork was old and/or very overcooked, possibly microwaved. It had a strange taste to it and was gray and tough!!! There was a tiny amount of ham, like 1-2 slices, barely there cheese. It was mostly bread. This sandwich left you only tasting the mustard.  We were pressed for time and starving, so we had no choice but to eat the food, but I wish I would have sent it back and got a refund. Hopefully for others, they were having a bad night.  I will not return for the food, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Incredible experience! Had a wonderful time grabbing a quick bite here with my wife. We've enjoyed Chef Aaron Chamberlin's restaurants for a while and this new addition to Tempe is fantastic! We enjoyed the Cubano sandwich along with their baked sweet potato and a few drinks. The bartender Tara was very accommodating and elevated our overall experience, thank you Tara for a memorable time! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great Outdoor bar and seating area, atmosphere is excellent. Happy hour pricing seemed a little erratic. Food ok, but they are still getting up and going. They had A LOT of business and seemed overwhelmed- guy next to me had to prompt waitress about a chicken sandwich and he was there before us and we were served before him. We took one look at the register line and grabbed two seats at the bar to avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"Had the Rooster Booster breakfast with eggs over-easy.  It was decent, but last Friday I had breakfast at another local restaurant, same items but everything there was better."}
{"text":"The temperature to start was too warm. The food was way over-priced. I ordered a salad and added chicken for $4 and the chicken was dark and white meat mix which appeared to boiled- it couldn't be less appealing to the eye. The customer service was okay except no one ever came to ask how our food was, which might be good since  new place is fairly new. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We looked forward to enjoying a new place. On a Saturday morning we met friends for breakfast.  The best way to sum it up: boring. Maybe we expected to much. We'll try again in the future but based on witnessing restaurants come & go they do not seem to have staying power."}
{"text":"Phoenix Public Market has landed in South Tempe!  Get ready for an amazing experience...thank you Chamberlin's!! I had to order Chile verde pot pie right out of the gate and anything with Chicken here is superb. The food is fresh, like really fresh from all local sources. The grand fireplace  and planter walls are the recycled concrete from sidewalks of previous store. The menu is diverse and will require several visits. The outside patio has outdoor heating and the misters appear to technological marvels too expensive for a homeowner.  The build out is just impressive, not seen in the East Valley but our time has come.  This is not a traditional restaurant, There are no table servers per se. You can order at the counter when you walk in, full service at the bar or even while sitting outside by  utilizing a floating server.  Grab your silverware before sitting down. Need a beer? Floating server  swipes your card right there. Slick. The outside benches all have electric plugs built in- see photo and enjoy the music. This is a local owner providing amazing food and ambiance,just chill and enjoy while they train people, it's not a corporate restaurant chain."}
{"text":"I've been waiting over a year for this place to open. We are lacking local dining options in South Tempe, so I was excited to eat here and to fall in love with a new local restaurant in my backyard.  We arrived around 7pm the night before the grand opening. The place was packed and there was a private event on the patio. I didn't realize it is a order at the counter type of place but don't mind. The dinner entree selection is small, there are mostly pizza and sandwich options. We decided to try the soft pretzel and cheese appetizer, my friend got the chicken platter with mashed potatoes and spinach and I wanted to try the pork chile verde pot pie and threw in a grilled cheese. The pretzels were very thick almost like pretzel sandwich buns and had no salt. The cheese sauce was good although grainy. The chicken dinner was ok nothing to write home about. The pork chile verde pot pie was not good, the pork was very fatty and it was too spicy. The grilled cheese was not worth the price especially since there isn't even a side with it. The staff came by to check on how things were  but even after letting them know the issues they didn't seem to care. We spent over $40 and didn't have any drinks.  My excitement was short lived and unfortunately I don't really feel a need to go back. I'm sure this place will be busy for a while but with the Scottsdale prices and lacking food, will it last?"}
{"text":"These restaurants are a great concept but a little pricey. We went to the soft opening of TBMC, everyone was nice and had awesome attitudes.  They were still figuring everything out at the time but it was to be expected.  The owner/chef was personable and cool to talk to as well.  I visit the downtown Phoenix location and that place is just about a well oiled machine so In a few months I'd expect nothing less from this place.  The Foods good and they have adult beverages and it was kid friendly, and just wanted to say thanks for the invite and we will be going there again!"}
{"text":"Went here the other night with a group of friends. We didn't know it was a counter order place, no table service. I ordered a hamburger which cost $11 but the only thing you get is a hamburger no side. I added a very small side salad for $4 so $15 for my meal that I had to stand in line and order. I thought that was a lot. We also ordered appetizers which we got right away but literally 4 min. Later main food came out. It sounds weird but I'm complaining because our service was too fast! We actually got our dinners before our drinks! You also have to get up and order drinks from the bar each time you need one. If I wanted that I would just stay home. I will say the patio area is super, fire pits all around. Food was excellent and the waitstaff is very friendly and extremely helpful probably because they don't have to do much, lol."}
{"text":"We had genuinely hoped that this place would be good as it is within walking distance from our home.  Unfortunately, there was nothing but disappointment.  We were greeted upon arrival and were told that the outdoor seating was open, so we grabbed a table (we were there a bit before the crowds that came later).  What they failed to tell us was that you had to go to the bar to order your drinks.  The 'wait' staff that was milling about outside was not able to take any orders.    When I went to the bar to order my drinks, it was quite the wait (remember that I was there early).  I ordered our drinks, but when I wanted to place a food order, I was informed that I had to go inside, to the counter that was 5 feet from where I was standing, to place the food order.  Again, a line.    In all, I spent roughly 15-20 minutes away from the folks I was there with, simply trying to place an order.    I had to repeat this process every time we needed refills on our drinks.  I also had to repeat this process again when we were ready to go and I needed to close out my tab.  In all, we were there about 2 hours and about half of that was spent standing in line.  This is not a good set up for a casual evening out with friends.  Go elsewhere unless they change their process.  I talked with several people in line that were equally frustrated with the set up.  If they wish to keep this set up, then they need to at least have someone greet you that explains their processes as it is not entirely clear."}
{"text":"Food is great, atmosphere is great. Good chill spot. Good drink selection. Kind of pricey for the amount of food that you get though."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to finally have a public market cafe in Tempe!!! I came within a week of the grand opening cause I was really trying to take advantage of the free cookies and boy oh boy it was BUSY! the line was out the door. I feel like the line would have moved a lot faster if they had another employee at the second register.   Other than that, it was a great first experience at this Tempe location. The inside and patio area are all really great seating with a bar in the middle for easy access whether you're inside our outside.   I got the breakfast quinoa bowl and my friend got the crispy chicken sandwich and they were both really solid. I loved the dill Dijon sauce that came with the crispy sandwich. The cookies were a nice bonus too!   Excited to come back for dinner to get the pot pie or fried chicken....or both....."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I've been here a few times. They have a decent selection of breakfast and lunch options, and they have coffee but it isn't my favorite."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this local hangout is the perfect fit and need right here in South Tempe. It definitely has filled the niche for great food and convenient location. The hipster staff is friendly and helpful. Love it!"}
{"text":"Good food, but not worth standing in line for 30 minutes. Especially since the reason is that they only have one register open."}
{"text":"Big crowds for opening weekend for this \"underserved\" community, but soups, salads, burgers, pizza, sandwiches, sangria all worth the wait for this group! Staff is very attentive. Manager stopped by to say hi and thanks us for our patience, but we are just grateful for good food in South Tempe!"}
{"text":"Exceptional lunch spot, Desserts & Bar!   Tips: Cubano sandwich- amazing, juicy & super filling so be ready! Rice bowl (add chicken)- great flavor, tons of veggies and awesome portion!   Desserts- tons to choose from... but the macaroons- finally a place as good as Essence bakery was (closed now) in Tempe.  Tried 4 flavors! Make sure you let them warm up to room temp to get that nice softness.   1- BlackBerry & lemon was so yummy- with its hint of lemon 2- Mango & Chile pepper- awesome bite of spice  3- Black & white- Oreo!!! 4- Salted Carmel- yes it's green with gold flecks/sparkles but the sweetness- wow!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. I was really excited for this place to open, and it is such a letdown. Today was our 3rd visit and each visit has gotten worse. We sit at the bar because we like service, rather than ordering at a counter and getting a number. Three bartenders behind the bar and we had to ask for every single thing. Can we order a drink? Can we order food? Can we have silverware? Can we get another drink? Can we pay our tab? Sorry Tempe Public Market, your food is only so-so and doesn't make up for the lazy service. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Can I say love at first bite! The crispy chicken sandwich was delicious and hit the spot for lunch. My friend and I grabbed a table at the bar on the patio side after recommendation by Ken(restaurant employee). I loved sitting outside and enjoying the ambience and the nice breeze.   We sat close to bartender that helped with our every need from being us ice cold water when we sat down to recommending several of his favorites on the menu. I decided to try the sandwich that he recommended and it did not disappoint me! After the first bite I immediately knew why he loved this sandwich, as the chicken was hot/ juicy and hand breaded. The sandwich was topped with crunchy slaw and bread/butter pickles and if I am not mistaken I tasted a bit of honey drizzled on the chicken. I cut the sandwich in half thinking I could only eat one half but I quickly finished the sandwich. I will order the crispy chicken sandwich again.   Tip.. The parking was challenging so car pool if you are going in group as there are other business in this complex."}
{"text":"If a restaurant can be fun, this is it. You will be returning to try something new each visit. Great food freshly prepared and with healthy options. Best Cuban ever. And Iwas lucky to be there when pumpkin soup was the daily soup. The kale salad tasted as if it was picked that morning. Move this to the top of your restaurant list and eat here soon."}
{"text":"I am such a fan of the Phoenix location and St. Francis that I was pretty stoked to hear that chef Aaron Chamberlin was putting a location in the East Valley (closer to home for me). I thought the decision to put a location in a quiet residential part of southern Tempe with no restaurants within a mile was pretty bold for them. They are essentially sending a message that they are going to own this area and be a cafe for the surrounding neighborhoods. I'll be honest that my first couple of visits during opening month had its issues. The lines were super long and the customer service was working through many kinks. But after a few months, Tempe Public Market is quietly settling in and becoming a staple in this area. The patio area is dog friendly and very spacious. They have plenty of misters for the hot summers and a killer fireplace for the colder winter evenings. I like that beverages (non-alcoholic) are self-serve. They have counter service for ordering your food and seating is open. These are some of those things that makes this place feel like home. So far I've had breakfast and dinner here now. The Blue Corn Pancake is fantastic. It's pretty large but not too filling for a pancake. The Steel Cut Oats are good but a little on the pricey side for me for oatmeal. I did enjoy coming here for community night for dinner. They do a 3 course dinner for around $13 that includes salad, entree and dessert. The fried chicken was nice and tender and really flavorful. Overall I can see this as a regular stop for me (especially in the mornings on that patio). I love the Farmer's Market at the Phoenix location and hope that is something that gets incorporated here someday."}
{"text":"Really cool decor and atmosphere. Lots of seating. Yummy sounding food choices ! It looks pretty trendy and upscale. We stopped just on a while while running errands this week.  The person who took our order was either annoyed or maybe the music was too loud but I didn't get a welcome feeling.   My husband ordered a burger. Not bad but not overwhelmingly great. The bun was yummy though.   I ordered a grilled cheese and seriously... ANYWHERE makes a better grilled cheese. The bread was dry. The cheese was barely there. And there wasn't any flavor. I ate half. Tried to share some with my kiddo who was not interested at all... And finished off my husband's burger. The price for the grilled cheese is ridiculous especially when THAT was what I got. I was really excited and was super disappointed.   The fries were decent. Not worth the  $4 side charge though. We ate maybe half each.   My husband told the manager I guess (?) About the sandwich and he didn't offer any solutions or obviously have any knowledge on what to even say. We aren't mean or throw fits. But we do expect quality when the cost is is this tier.  The macaroon was AMAZING though. So there's that.  I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Patience required. Over 40 minutes since we ordered 3 ice creams and a kid's pizza and still waiting. Kids are frustrated, cheap kids meals but crazy to have to wait so long."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, but the food quality has been inconsistent. I finally got my husband to try this place, which is within walking distance of our house.  He is not a fan. The food on this last visit was really underwhelming and not what I had experienced before.  Both the pizza and the nachos were both lacking cheese, as if the kitchen was running really low and rationing what they had.  The nachos consisted of a huge plate of chips with black beans dumped in a pile the middle and a small bit of guac and diced tomato.  On a previous visit they had more generous toppings, including cheese.  Overall a nice place to hang with friends but in my opinion the food does not warrant the high prices. The employees were all very friendly."}
{"text":"I love having the market cafe in Tempe.  There's good seating, food and beverages.  This is great for groups or for smaller numbers.  Come eat and be merry."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Out of everything and service totally sucked from Mesa and will never travel out here again. Save time and frustration people. Go to pita jungle or living room if you want good food and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Love the new addition to the neighborhood! The staff, atmosphere and food are fantastic! I've tried most of the items on the menu, all really good! They could use a better wine selection, but I think they are working on that. I would encourage you to try this very cool place!"}
{"text":"It was okay.  We went around 5:30 on a Saturday night and they were out of all their food other than pizza.  (How does that happen?!?!)  Thankfully, there wasn't a line, so we ordered two pizzas and two glasses of wine and sat down. The wine came out right away, but the pizzas took more than 45 minutes.  We were starving by the time they came out, so I feel like anything edible would have been outstanding at that point.  Even still, the pizzas were just okay.  Nothing special.  All in all, the experience wasn't good.  It wasn't terrible, but I'm certainly not in a hurry to get back."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice. I like that they have healthier options. The food I had was fine, but overpriced for what it was."}
{"text":"I ordered the frittata with crispy potatoes. Certainly was not impressed with the service from the counter. One of the bartenders was attentive and friendly. Underwhelmed by the food :/. However, my vanilla latte was heavenly."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant but food is nothing special and pretty pricy. Blue corn pancake is good but at $10 for one, a pricy choice."}
{"text":"It's loud. Unsure why every \"hot and hip\" place has to pound out the beats like a nightclub these days. I suppose I'm old now. Had the Flanched Flarney Garney. Just know that it says \"chunky avocado\" but it's guacamole (you know, onions, garlic, and the like). The sandwich left a bit of a grease puddle but tasted ok. Bread was light and fit the rest well. Good service and was quick. Do again? Perhaps, but I'll bring earplugs."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant! South Tempe really needed a place like this!   I go for the dog friendly patio, smiling gracious staff, and Lee Travino cocktail.... It's like a spicy boozy Arnold Palmer. Sooo good!   Some food favorites of mine are the pan pizzas, look for the market specials they run with local produce and the crispy chicken sandwich with honey dill dijon sauce.   I also love that my kids and I can come in and they serve breakfast until 3 pm.   Overall great new place with friendly staff and good food!  A must visit if you live nearby."}
{"text":"From the minute I walked in this place was chaos.  The workers look frazzled and disorganized. As I was waiting in line I was told by a cashier that she could help me at her register. So I headed over only to find there was someone at the register, and causing the people behind me on line to order before me at the other register. Then I ordered Tito's Cubano without pickles and dijonnaise. I was told that all the sandwiches are premade. As I rethought my selection another worker told me they could make me a fresh sandwich, so I ordered it. Some time later, how long, I'm not quite sure, we (well my family) got their orders, but it felt like eternity. My sandwich did not come out. Shortly after a manager came to the table and advised me that they were making my fresh sandwich. Bless his soul. He was very apologetic. Unfortunately, he was mistaken. No one was making me a fresh sandwich. In fact I received the sandwich without pickles, however, upon inspecting the supposed fresh sandwich, and much to my surprise, discovered that the staff had simply removed the pickles, leaving behind pickle residue (I didn't go to graduate school for nothing). To wrap things up, my daughter said her hamburger was dry. My other daughter hated her grilled cheese. On the plus, my wife seemed to have enjoyed her salmon and the fries were top notch, hence the one star. We've been for brunch before and will only return for brunch, as that was a much more pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Awesome to have a little \"local love\" in the Tempe area. After living downtown for years, we crave yummy local foods that support the local businesses.  The outside seating is my favorite. Brunch is really good. The blue corn pancake is awesome, although I wish they had a smaller order of it (it's a $10 pancake with no sides and it's huge, so it's a full commitment for breakfast!). The teas and coffees are great.  We also did dinner here. Pizza was surprisingly good. Fried chicken was awesome. Didn't love the pot pie, but my hubby liked it.  Great place to ride the bikes and hang for a happy hour cocktail or two!  Definitely a regular spot for us going forward."}
{"text":"Our favorite brunch spot.  Food is simple, but so damn good and consistent.  Service is where this place lacks.  We sit at the bar every time, and need to ask for every single thing...from menus and ordering, to drinks and refills, and then to finally check out.  Will update to 5 stars when service improves."}
{"text":"Don't know what the fuss is about but not worth the price or the wait in line on the weekends. Small menu, food is good but nothing special.  Because it has vegan options everyone is falling in love with it. Nice patio-staff is okay unless they are busy, then forget getting help. Too many other places with better menu options"}
{"text":"Well...well, well. Nice ambiance and feel. Friendly staff and not too too pricey. Menu is limited but offer basic, tasty goods. Juice is excellent and oh yeah love the outdoor seating and fire! I'd probably go back."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place. Stopped by for a quick breakfast, ordered the breakfast burrito to go. Thought it was a bit pricey, but it was the most portable- looking breakfast on the menu.   When I opened the box, I was surprised that the tortilla looked oily. It must have been warmed with oil on the grill. It was so oily that it was dripping out of the bottom. The insides were tasty, but I skipped the tortilla.   I will say the coffee was excellent!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place but, was really disappointed.  We stopped in for breakfast and there weren't many choices and everything came with potatoes and / or toast.  No options for those who don't want a carby meal.  Yes, I know you can order it without bread and potatoes but, you have to pay for them anyway so it would be nice to have at least one option for those who don't eat all the heavy carbs.  I ordered the Devils Mess (without the tortilla) and despite the fact that it had chorizo, chilis and salsa, it was really lacking flavor.  It had heat, don't get me wrong, but heat doesn't equal flavor.  Plus, mine was supposed to come with spinach and I only had 3 leaves of spinach.  Overall it was bland.  It really could have used some cheese or sour cream to cut the heat.  My daughter had the breakfast burrito and again just thought it was meh.  Not much flavor, large pockets of cheese that wasn't evenly distributed throughout the burrito.  The coffee was ok.  It was towards the end of the self serve carafe so it wasn't as warm as it should have been.  I think the food was was too expensive for what you got - $27 for two for breakfast that was just so so is too much for me.  And, it's seriously loud in the restaurant.  We ate inside - not sure if outside was quieter but, inside, we could barely talk to each other it was so loud.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been several times at this point, coffee, breakfast and lunch.   I have really liked everything that I have had there and I enjoy the environment!!!!  I decided to do a review because I have heard some negative comments from folks and gave encouraged them to try or try again if had initial bad experience!!!  I will continue to support great addition S. Tempe!!! I wish it was on corner Ray/Rural!!! Come on West Chandler:)))"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast menu and quick service.  I had their frittata-which is different from a classic Italian frittata.  It was a fairly thin round omelet with fresh arugula, cherry tomatoes, red peppers, onions and pesto.  It was delicious and you get a whole serving of veggies to start your day!  Fresh and beautiful!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here... super cute/neat  inside loved the atmosphere. Nothing really BAD but definitely nothing thing GREAT. Cashier not very friendly made us feel like we needed to hurry up and order and move on. Food came out with good time and looked great. The food was OK but way over priced. We were not impressed enough by either the staff, the food or the prices will not be back... thank you for the experience though."}
{"text":"First time leaving a review, I literally created an account to do so.  Where to start? My family took my mother here for her birthday dinner last night. She was happy with her food, but the rest of us?  I wasn't feeling super hungry, so when we each placed our orders, I asked for the pretzels with cheese and a side of bacon. What came out was a stale, stiff, bland hunk of bread, with a melted puddle of flavorless Velveeta. As for the side of bacon? They crunched up a bit and put it the cheese.  Half our orders came out 20 minutes late, too. When they finally delivered the pizza, it too was boring and flavorless. We put it in a to-go box on the off chance that maybe it would make a decent 2am snack if it was smothered in enough condiments to make you forget what you were eating. It didn't.  Oh, then there's the layout. Given the location, they have a huge amount of real estate, but the out door area is primarily unused space, with too few tables. What's more, half the tables don't even have chairs! People standing around holding their plates of food, which grow cold waiting for a place to sit...  On top of that, the entrance is arranged in a matter that the line to the bathroom and the line to order are the same thing, creating confusion and disorganization. The icing on top of that cupcake is that you can't even see the menu until you're about to order!  I've never left a bad review before in my life, but this place absolutely sucked and I'll definitely not be returning, especially if their social media manager replies with the exact same canned message that's been sent to other reviewers instead of actually addressing the glaring issues with their service and quality of food."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the neighborhood and I'm amazed at the size inside and out! The menus is huge with something for everyone from classic diner food to healthy. Vegetarian, vegan, dairy free....no problem.   I started with coffee and stayed through lunch I loved the vibe so much! Their baked goods look amazing and the service was great.   They can be very busy 11-12:30 but then it slows way down and the service was super quick.   I had their Chino salad which essentially is a Chinese chicken salad with a ginger dressing that I found very bitter. Probably wouldn't order this again because of all the Napa cabbage but, that's my fault. The menu clearly states the ingredients."}
{"text":"Excited there is a new place I can bike too for happy hour...patio is beautiful.. however serious staff and management issues... long waits.... unengaged bar tenders...sat down today at bar...2 other people there and after 8 minutes had to wave down bartender 3 feet from me... also, I watched so much wasted beer on the pours...they are literally pouring out half glass of foam... John taferter would have a stroke watching them!  Patio is dog friendly... I will give them a third try with hopes that they can get it together"}
{"text":"Came for the \"market\" not realizing it is a restaurant.  Fine!   Found a seat near an outside bench and the friendly bar tender (pink and red hair) was running drinks and took the time to tell me she should take our order.   A pitcher of their house beer at only $10 during happy hour made our Sunday afternoon!  Coming back for the food that looks amazing!!   Great vibe. Cool patio. Terrific music."}
{"text":"I LOVE this neighborhood cafe. There is something so special about a place where the chefs and waitresses know you and there is a real sense of community . It's awesome to know that you're eating healthy and whole food.   I just say keep doing what you're doing. If you come here I suggest EVERYTHING :) and don't skip the bakery at the end.   *side note I would love this place even more if they switched over to paper straws"}
{"text":"Really nice spot, has a beautiful location and decorations but the food is questionable. The coffee is actually good, they got my espresso right. I for sure would go here again in the future. More of a cafe then a restaurant though :)"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but it missed the mark for me. Average food but above average prices. It is set up like a fast food place where you order at a counter and they bring the food to you. Drinks have to be ordered/purchased from a separate counter. Poorly stocked bar. The location is great and I think the place would benefit from a more traditional restaurant set up with wait staff. Disappointing."}
{"text":"My wife had been wanting to try this place for the past few months but it was always jam packed when we went there . So today we got there a bit earlier  at around 11:00 A M and it was not so packed . The ambiance of the place is excellent the build out of the facility is beautiful . I ordered the Chicken Salad Sandwich and the wife ordered the Superfood Salad . Both items in our opinion were horrible ...we eat at various other places like A J's , Panera and Whole Foods and all of those places put out quality good tasting food at reasonable prices . I would suppose other items on the menu could be better . Chicken salad is a very common item that you can get almost anywhere and I am almost never disappointed when I order it no matter where I go . So this was just a total surprise to me how bad this sandwich was .The Superfood salad looked disgusting and did not taste much better I spent $ 25.00 on these two items (included  a $2.00 tip on credit card at the checkout ) and was just really disappointed in the food ,,,.hard to believe but true .... \"OVERPRICED & UNDERWHELMING \" ."}
{"text":"It was difficult to give this place only 3 stars as the food is fantastic yet the service is very poor.  We have been there 3 times since they opened.  We loved the chorizo biscuits and gravy so much that one of us orders it each time, the other one orders something new so we explore the menu.  The blue corn pancake is amazing as it is flavorful yet not too sweet.  We have also ordered the Devils Mess and the Rooster Booster and both were very basic but fresh and tasty.  The pop tarts and bread are sooo good!   Now, for the reality.....the servers, although nice, need intense training. Two of the three times we were there we have had to ask for silverware and that was after our food had arrived.  During our visit today, the waiter put in the wrong order so we had to eat separately as one dish had to be sent back.  I ordered hot tea and was told I could put my teabag in the small cup and could get more hot water later.  When I looked in the cup I noticed it was not clean so I cleaned it with my napkin!  I had to ask the waiter for more hot water rather than the waiter realizing it was time for a refill.  My husband had water and never was he asked if he needed a refill - an yes, that has been the case at each visit.  Their attention to details has a lot to be desired, therefore the reason for 3 stars.  I'm hoping to repost soon with many more stars    To sum this up, we will continue to go back for awhile realizing this is a new business but we are hoping to see an increase in customer service very soon!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the positive, the food was ok, hence the two stars but the whole experience deserves 1 Star. I had to wait over a half hour to order food. There was only one cashier and like 10 people standing behind her on the food line. There was also one other person drying silverware but no other cashiers. My friend and I ordered separately to save a table so between my half hour and her half hour to wait in line, we didn't eat for an hour. By the time we could sit down together her food was sitting there while she waited for me to get my food. She ordered a bowl of soup that was literally gone in 4 bites. I thought she had already starting eating when I sat down but no it was just the smallest bowl of soup--not a cup of soup. My salad had a dressing on the side  that I think equaled a tablespoon. All in all we were both disappointed and agreed it was a terrible experience!"}
{"text":"Tempe Public Market Cafe was great! The service was awesome, especially considering how busy it was. We had breakfast sandwiches with potatoes and drip coffee, all very good! We sat outside at the bar which is full service. We'll definitely be back when we're in the area again."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it two stars because of the ambiance. Seriously, what's the hype about this place? I literally live one minute away from it and pass by it multiple times in a day and it's always packed?!  Have tried it three times because I wanted to try out different items. I really wanted to like this place however I must confess, the food is below par. The burger is the only fair/good item I've had. And if I was craving a burger I'd definitely go elsewhere.   But I guess all the great reviews here will drown mine. Just giving you my honest opinion that's all."}
{"text":"Only reason that this is not a 1 star review is because the Chicken Quesadilla my daughter got was good and the guacamole that came with it was good too. The Chicken Pot Pie my wife got did NOT have a flaky crust, in fact it was almost too hard to break through.  The chicken inside was LARGE chunks.   The Cubano I got had nicely toasted bread but the internals were room temp at best with almost zero sauce other than on the sides. The waitperson brought my daughter's food almost 5 minutes before the rest of the food arrived. It is on us that we didn't send our food back."}
{"text":"Food not as well prepared as phx mkt.  This is my 4th attempt. But i still like the cookies."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Nicely decorated. Bright lit. Prices are on the higher end for dinner. $10+. I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich it was good and I tasted some sweetness in every bite, maybe honey? I don't think it was amazingly flavorful but good enough. My friend ordered an AZ burger but it came a while later, where mine and my other friends came five minutes after. They apologized and gave my friend a full refund."}
{"text":"I've been here twice both late afternoon during the week and it was still very busy. Overall it was good.  Pros: breakfast selections until later in the day. Food was delicious (except for...). Outdoor area was great to enjoy the good weather.  Cons: overpriced dishes followed by every add-on being chargeable, a nickle and dime you type place.  As stated above all the food we had both time in our groups was good except for the pizza. We had 2 different types of pizza and both lacked any kind of flavor and were soft and squishy. If you stay clear of the pizza I think you will be happy as everything else we had was good/great."}
{"text":"Giving that this place just opened, our dinner was average. We tried the rancher pizza, which was YUMMY! We also had the Caesar salad (which came with kale), I usually love the combo, but here it wasn't much to write home to mom about. We also tried the black bean soup... it was good if you like straight mashed black beans. I would have preferred if there was a little bit more flavor to it! Other than that it was an overall positive experience- the line didn't take too long and the food came out rather quickly. Would definitely love to return when they are less busy and try a breakfast or lunch item."}
{"text":"I went back to TPM for a second chance on Valentine's Day after an underwhelming first impression at its Grand Opening earlier this year. Overall, a much better experience - it was raining and cold, so we didn't get to sit outside, but there was plenty of indoor seating available (although the tables are pretty close together). We were able to try the chicken and pot pie dishes this time around, and they were both delicious! The pot pie is deceivingly small - it doesn't look it at first sight, but it will definitely fill you up! I also tried the Live and Let Bee drink - one of the best cocktails I've ever had! We talked to the bartender, who told us they make their own lavender syrup in-house.   Employees came around to our table multiple times to see if we needed anything and were very polite - our dishes were bused promptly, as well. Wait time on the food was adequate!    My only gripe is that some items seem a little overpriced - $4 for a side of fries when I'm already spending $11 - $13 on a sandwich seems a little unfair, especially since they're just batched potatoes fried in oil!   Overall, I see myself returning to Tempe Public Market when I'm in the mood for a modern, trendy meal in a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"We love having a new option nearby. We have been there a few times now for dinner and love the food, service and environment. We often see friends and neighbors. It's our own \"Cheers/Regal Beagle\" hehehe."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, but I just can't.   The good: atmosphere, outside seating, dog friendly, great customer service.   The bad: pizza is not good. It's just a thick dough bread- like bad microwave pan pizza. I thought this place was a bit healthier and would have thin crispy pizza. We also had a burger which was okay. Lastly, had two draft chardonnay- disgusting. My head will hurt if I describe it further."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, open and friendly, spot for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Love when they have a good special. Hamburger is fab. Chicken is delicious. Great veggies and lighter options. Plenty of food and can't miss on the desserts. It is run very well, open to experience a great meal. I think it is perfect for us on the chandler border and travel often to meet people here. So glad they expanded from downtown Phoenix. We even have a T-shirt because we love this place! Eat here!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It has a cool vibe and looks like a great place to grab a beer. I should have had a beer but it wasn't quite beer-thirty. patiently waited In an unreasonably long line to eat a  tasteless, watery bowl of quinoa and a lemon loaf that tasted like a slice of white bread. When I finally made it to the register I was much older but non the wiser. The counter service was slow, I had to bob and weave to avoid the employees walking around the cashier to the dining room. The food came out quick and after my first bite I understood why.  Half the food was nuclear hot and the other half luke warm-straight out of the microwave. Straight out of Compton would be have been better. The little  amount of  quinoa I did eat was very bland. I don't usually salt my food but I would have \"as-salted\" this dish with something I recommend-it's called flavor. I don't  recommend the Quinoa \"soup,\" or as it's called on their menu the quinoa bowl. I had  hope the lemon loaf would redeem the \"quinoa experience .\" At first bite I thought it tasted like a napkin until I realized i accidentally ate the napkin. To my dismay the pastry was mostly a very dry, bread -no lemon flavor whatsoever. My boyfriend's egg sandwich was palatable. I did finish eating the napkin. Try the pizza because everyone seems to like it. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the neighborhood and amazed at the size inside and out! Great ambiance and food!  My friend and I both ordered their crispy chicken sandwich.  We loved our meals and the service.  In addition, we ordered their coffee lattes which were great as well.  Overall excellent venue and will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"So happy they have opened a Public Market Café in Tempe!! Love going to Phoenix Public Market Café, but finally one that is closer to me with the same great affordable and locally sourced food as it's sister restaurants. A great place to hangout anytime/day of the week with a dog friendly patio! I got the Chorizo Biscuits and Gravy with Scrambled Eggs. My sister got the breakfast sandwich and my step mom had the Asian chicken salad. Plus the Sun Devil Fries that we all shared. Everything was amazing as expected and I cannot wait to come back and bring my friends! Don't forget to stop in for their Cinnamon Rolls (weekends only while supplies last) they are to die for!! But they have a bunch of other super delicious pastries for sale every day!"}
{"text":"We just had a fantastic graduation party for my grandson here! Food and service impeccable and can't say enough about Sarah and Ken and the service...thank you!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of the Phoenix Public Market Café and was super thrilled to have Tempe Public Market Café in my area to add to my lunch time eats!  January was a rough month for Tempe Public Market and I, since its newly opened there has always been a crazy line, I did try to get their lunch twice and had to bail both times since I am on a timed lunch on the 3rd try I got their and there was no line! 3rd times a charm, right?  I arrived about 10 minutes before 11am and didn't realize I could only order off the breakfast menu, but I was asked what I was interested in and told them and was told that they could make that happen!   I ordered the rice & beans bowl, it had black beans, brown rice, avocado, feta cheese, house made salsa and cilantro, this was a great tasting bowl and just what I was craving!  I am sure Tempe Public Market Café and I will become fast friends!"}
{"text":"I would have given at least 4 1/2 to 5 stars. The food was delicious and the wait staff attentive. However while sitting at the bar one of the staff who was prepping garnish for cocktails and making coffee kept wiping his nose with his hand and did not wash his hands after. Thank goodness was drinking wine and he did not touch my glass.  After I left I reflected that I probably should have said something at the moment."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere. Servers could use some more training but still well worth a visit!!"}
{"text":"Similar but updated to the original in downtown. Clean atmosphere but can be loud at times. They don't have rotisserie chicken or sparkling water on tap, which is a bummer. Free WiFi (password is: 4806295120) and seating is great to meet or work. Breakfast is served until 3:00pm which is a major plus!  Prices on food and coffee are generally fair. Pizza seemed a little steep in price ($14-16/pizza)."}
{"text":"I've always had this place in mind since it looks like a great place to eat at and I wasn't disappointed at all! I ordered the flanched flarney garney and it was delicious. Very well cooked scrambled eggs with a nice crispy bacon and a nice touch of mayo with guacamole. I would recommend this dish for sure! Also great designed location and a perfect patio to enjoy a nice meal. On top of that the service was great and very fast to get your order. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place after all the preopening hype,but was sadly disappointed.  However, as it's new, will probably try it one more time.   My wife and I visited on a Sunday evening and were impressed with the buildout and ambience.  Nice big patio, dog friendly, cool fireplaces.  I'm not sure how well this will work when it's 110 degrees this summer, but the patio is quite spacious. The interior is typically modern hipster-friendly, clean and well appointed. Nice looking place.   First of all, you have a Chipotle-like line which is SLOW.  And then, you have to wait for your order to be delivered. We waited over forty minutes from line to serving.  That's not so great.    We split a Cuban sandwich, which was $13 with no side.  ($4 extra for an order of fries). Bread was fine.  Very little meat.  I've had Cubans for $10 with twice the meat.  Apparently this joint has taken a lesson from Jimmy Johns on shorting sandwich fillings.    Similar items on the menu seem to be overpriced compared to other places.   We took advantage of the happy hour beer prices, and that was fine.  The Tempe Lager was good.  As stated, I'll give Tempe Public Market at least another try before moving on. But the combination of high prices and (at least in this case)  mediocre food isn't a good harbinger for the future."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I went to a restaurant and was blown away by the entire experience. Everyone who works here was super friendly,  the place was immaculate. Our food was fresh and hot, and delicious. Crispy chicken sandwich was so good.  My fiance had the Cubano which was excellent. I would definetly recommend this place and can see this place becoming a new favorite."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with food you will come back for. We started with the house pretzels (light and full of flavor with a jalapeño cheddar sauce that complemented extremely well). Followed with sun devil fries (cooked perfectly). For the main course we tried the AZ burger and chicken sandwich. Everything was surprisingly light and VERY fresh. All of the food was well balanced with every bite more enjoyable than the last."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night for the first time. The place was done really well. The patio is awesome. The major flaw with this place is the service style. You order at the counter and tables are first come first serve. This posses many problems. First off people are lurking everywhere to snag the first table that opens up. It is wierd to have people just standing around trolling for your table. The next issue is good luck getting anything else for you table such as dessert or drinks. You have to go stand in line at the bar to get drinks. No service at the tables. This format would be great for lunch, but for dinner they really need to switch to the traditional host/server model. The food was good. Pizza was just ok. Kids cheeseburger came with no cheese. Good luck getting mayo or mustard. The fried chicken was really good. The best I have had in a while. We will give this place another chance just for the patio and fried chicken."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate there on a Tuesday night around 7PM, no line and plenty of seating. Food came out about 5 minutes after we ordered. I wanted an order of their devil fries and the server put in the order for me instead of making me go back to the cashier. Food was good, but the portions were slightly on the small side for the price we paid. I'm not a huge fan of the service style, but I'll go back."}
{"text":"This place was underwhelming. I've been wanting to go to the Phoenix Public Market Cafe for years (same menu) and I was so disappointed. Not only was the restaurant out of the items we ordered (rice, pretzel appetizer, etc.) but what we chose to substitute with wasn't even good and was very overpriced. $10+ for a chicken sandwich. Bun and fried chicken (no toppings bc my boyfriend d doesn't like pickles or coleslaw) that he said was mostly breading and no chicken at all. With no sides. $4 extra to add fries is a little steep when the sandwich doesn't stand alone. The salad I wanted had a few toppings out so I decided to make an \"a la carte\" style meal by ordering the sweet potato, broccoli and chicken. Pulled plain chicken with no season, plain broccoli and plain sweet potato with a side of \"Chile lime butter\" (that looked like just butter mixed with peppers). We got the chips and guacamole appetizer too - $10 for a small plate of chips but at least the salsa and guacamole had pretty good flavor. Overall this place was overpriced and just not good. We could have made several plates of what we ordered at home for way less money. The ambiance and service didn't make it worth it either when you have to get your own water and utensils. There are much much better restaurants around town and this one just can't compete."}
{"text":"Lunch visit was very disappointing. Parking was very difficult and it was crowded in the restaurant as well. It was extremely noisy and could barely carry on conversation with people next to us. Even worse was  the high prices for mediocre food. The fries were dry and greasy. definitely not worth an extra $4.00. the grilled cheese sandwich was also dry and  had a smattering of cheese that could hardly be tasted.  Every side was an additional charge and just made whatever you ordered far too expensive for what you got. the staff who brought food to the table were very friendly as were those who checked back. It was not a visit or a meal that I enjoyed. I will not go back as there are many more restaurants to try."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner this past week with six other people. It was my sister's birthday and we were dying to try this place, so there were high expectations. The atmosphere is awesome, right off the bat. Inside the restaurant is open, airy, and has the feel of a true market. The patio is quite large and has a great vibe. The staff was genuinely friendly, helpful, and attentive! Kudos to them and their great attitudes!   A few of us ordered beer and wine, all of which was local: another plus! Prices were definitely fair for drinks. The food, however, is on the pricier side, but it's not anymore than you'd expect to pay at many other local or trendy spots.  Now the taste of the food - overall, it could be better. We were mildly disappointed with our meals. I had the pasta (I can't remember the name - it had a poblano cream sauce). It was alright, but was pretty severely lacking in seasoning. It could have used a bit of spice, garlic, or salt (and I never add salt to food!). Two in my group ordered the pork chile verde pot pie. On the smaller side, the chile was also surprisingly bland. A bummer for an Arizona restaurant. My dad had the Del Real sandwich, a vegetarian sandwich. It looked good, but was small and only came with a few grapes, and orange slice or two, and a few strawberries. Also a bummer for a $10 sandwich. The fried chicken was a huge plate, though. The pretzels were excellent.  I'd like to give this place another try, since the hype is so big. But hopefully the food will actually have some seasoning next time, otherwise the ambiance isn't worth the price alone."}
{"text":"The Tempe Public Market has an amazing atmosphere! Great music and an open air concept that has a stand alone fire place with multiple fire pits around an amazing patio area. The menu is diverse and extremely fresh. I had the AZ burger and it was great! My colleagues had the chicken sandwich and the brick pressed chicken and they were both pleased!"}
{"text":"Bummer!  I gave this place another try and got even more dissapointed,  they don't take To go orders over the phone!!! You have to drive to the restaurant and place your order to go in person.  I will not be wasting my time and money on this place. I wish I could give this place a ZERO star review.  Don't waste your time,  this place sucks!!  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We were very excited to take our parents to this restaurant for a couple of reasons- 1. Tempe has very few independent, non-chain restaurants.  2. we absolutely love Phoenix Public Market.   We arrived on Sunday night at 5:30, line almost out the door... why was there only one register open, and two people standing next to it doing nothing??  Ordered food- 40 minutes later half our order came out, waited another 10 for the rest of our food. Then some of the food was cold!   Food runners all seemed like they were walking in sand- very slow and sloppy dressed. Speed was no existent.   The location is great, building and ambience is great. Management has a ton to fix. Dine in Phoenix at St, Francis  or the original PPM."}
{"text":"Food was decent, service sucked! The set-up to order needs a great deal of improvement. On a Friday night, you can expect the line to be out the door and pretty soon, nobody is going to want to be waiting in the line out the door in 115 degree summer weather. When we visited, there were 2 cashiers. So you wait in line, order, sit down and then they bring your food out. Again, service was VERY slow and we had to go to the bar to order our drinks because we never got them from our server.  I'm a fan of Aaron's other restaurant in Phoenix (St. Francis) and I really wanted this place to be GREAT as South Tempe could use some better restaurants and more of a selection but honestly, I was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Yes a little wait but look at the crowd!!!  No one walking away.  The kitchen is cranking out the tickets as fast as they come in. Had biscuit & chorizo gravy.   AH-MAAAAAZING!!!  Hubby had the green chili pork pot pie.  Yummmmy. Will be back.  Just FYI.... we hv been here 1.5hrs and the line to order is still out the door with new customers pouring in.  Food is worth the wait.  Staff is attentive and kind."}
{"text":"Loved the Phoenix location so much, that I knew when I saw them building this location it would be awesome- I wasn't wrong. This is such a needed establishment in this area, it's awesome to have this place right down the street. As with all new restaurants, they are still working out the kinks of what works and what doesn't- the line to order food is a bit congested every time we go, but that'll change with time.   The food is awesome and as someone who does the Keto Diet- the fact that you can order things and easily have stuff be substituted or switched out is awesome. Definitely check these guys out during the week, weekends seem packed and lunch time can get a little crazy. The parking lot is weird, but considering the whole plaza is a little weirdly shaped, it's not surprising parking can be a battle now."}
{"text":"Awesome ambience, great food. This place is a home run. South Tempe had needed this type of amazing local restaurant. Chef Aaron Chamberlain (St Francis) has got it right again"}
{"text":"We went here on opening night, the food is alright, I don't know what the hype was about? It's like an open Panera that serves alcohol lol! The pizza we got (The Rancher) was good, friends got the Brussels Sprout pizza which was equally as tasty~ I liked their macarons, their PB&J macaron was really good! Was not a big fan of the pretzel and cheese, mostly the cheese because it tasted grainy :( BUT the pretzel was really good!  This place is a fun hang out spot, but the parking lot is really small for this type of establishment!"}
{"text":"Was really excited for Tempe Public Market to open in our neighborhood! I'm really familiar with the Phoenix public market downtown as well. We've visited the Tempe location a few times and have been overall pretty satisfied! The chicken sandwich is a new addition from the downtown menu and certainly delivers. The sun devil fries are tasty and crispy! My husband enjoyed the burger on one visit and was really impressed. Only thing that was lacking for me was the rice bowl.... it's my favorite thing downtown--- not sure if they do something different here but it was off! I'll give it another try tho! Overall, highly recommend checking them out! Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I love giving good reviews and mentioning people by name, but this place does not afford me that opportunity...I met a few old friend for lunch here today and we were REALLY disappointed! The line took 45 minutes to get through, and then our food took another 30 minutes to get to the table. When the kids cheeseburger and the adult grilled cheese that we ordered came to our table, they were cold and both looked like kids plates. I asked the server if this was the adult grilled cheese or the kids grilled cheese and he responded \"they're the exact same\". For the price difference, I feel like the adult grilled cheese should be bigger and better than the kids right?! It really was a sub par grilled cheese too. I could've saved myself $12 and made one at home. They only had one option for ice tea during the lunch rush, and no one had any idea if a kids meal included a drink. I had to go through three employees before I got an answer and they weren't even confident that it did. There are a lot of options for lunch in the area, I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"This is a nice joint for a fast casual restaurant!! Great breakfast and dinner/lunch options  you have to try the cauliflower steak and soft pretzels  so good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast at Tempe Public Market this week.  The service exceeded our expectations and the food was excellent.  The cafe has a nice urban vibe, with outdoor seating.  The coffee is great and the prices are reasonable.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Nothing like starting the day with a barely warm cappuccino. Seriously, there's just no excuse for that. First time I've ever one I've ever sent a coffee back. If the cups are cold, warm them up first, or store them on top of the espresso machine!   Seriously, you have got to get the basics right, or the rest of the place is going to be in trouble. The granola was meh. And \"out of oatmeal\" at 730am Saturday morning?"}
{"text":"My husband and kids had been with so/so luck on food and service. I begged them to give it another go so I could check it out.   The building and decor are really well done. I appreciate the light and natural vibe. The layout is a bit weird, I'm not sure there was a plan for the line to congregate in front of the door, bathroom and coffee...but on to the good stuff: food!  Kids meals: huge, very cheap at $3! Mine had the burger and cheese pizza! FYI no drink or side with this. I'm good with no drink, my kids are fine with water. A fruit cup would be a nice add on for more $.  We also tried chips and salsa/guacamole trio, fresh and tasty. The $10 tag on this seems high to me!  Last but not least, we shared the spicy pasta/chicken. It was amazing!   Service was good, still seems some kinks are happening but that's to be expected. The only concern I had was the water/ice machine was down so customers were all using the same scoop and ice bucket to serve themselves. I know this was a temporary fix but very unsanitary.  Please give this place a try or second chance! I love what it brings to the neighborhood and we need to support other developers that want to bring local into the surrounding strip malls of S. Tempe!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience... ordered oatmeal at counter, staff very friendly, first oatmeal was Luke warm, sent it back and second was also Luke warm.  Ordered yogurt...tasty but very little yogurt.  Coffee served in a paper cup, had to ask for a refill in a regular cup.  Servers never asked about refills.  Service poor  I had a positive response from Arron(?) but me never followed up on his offer of a gift card to try out the restaurant again.  Another disappointment!!"}
{"text":"Love having this so close to our house.  The service is always great and folks are friendly.  The rice bowl is a great go-to staple.  Great baked goods.  Earl Grey Tea bread is top-notch.  Do NOT miss the mashed potatoes.  Lots of fresh ingredients and the Cuban Also quite yummy."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the neighborhood. So far I've been here twice. Once on a Saturday morning, and then today I stopped in before work.   Today I got a soy latte and granola yogurt to-go and the coffee was delicious, the granola/fruit/yogurt was also yummy.   They still have some kinks to work out, but the vibe is cool and they have a great patio that I need to chill on before summer!"}
{"text":"Place is fun and service is great. We typically sit at the bar enjoying them serve ya. Everyone at the bar has been great. Oh and the outside patio is dog friendly."}
{"text":"Came the first week of opening. We were glad to sit at the bar, given the flow of people. We had breakfast. It was incredible. Handmade bagels made to perfection. Modest but filling portions. Exceptional Bloody Mary made by bartender. Favorite local breweries on draft. All beautiful and locally source veggies. Wonderfully balanced menu."}
{"text":"Good food, great ambiance (if you can find a place to sit outdoors), but a little pricy."}
{"text":"Worst set up! They allow you to open a tab at the bar but won't take an order at your table... what kind of service is that?!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! However I came out and my car had been side swiped! I called The establishment to see if anyone had come in to report it or if they had cameras. Manager told me she would get back to me to see if property management did! No return call. Beware the parking spaces are not very wide!"}
{"text":"Their food is great. I love everything I have tried and the service is always wonderful. The wait isn't as bad anymore and they are very fast about getting you in and seated even when the wait looks long. Definitely worth it and a great try."}
{"text":"It's a nice place but all four of us weren't overly impressed. I got the quiche and for $10 I would have expected a bigger slice -- the greens on my plate took up more space than the slice of quiche. I also found it odd that the drinks weren't listed on the big menu; the cashier had to hand me a menu so I could see the choices. I may try the place again for lunch, maybe I'll have a better experience. But if I do, it will be inside seating so I don't have to constantly swat the gnats & flies away from my plate when sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"Still three stars. I have been back twice since my original review.   SIDE NOTE: I did not take the manager's gift card, BTW. I appreciate the offer but I don't write reviews to get free stuff. ;)  Second visit: Co-worker wanted to go there so I went. Busy but it's lunchtime and that is expected. I order the pizza and even though it is silly expensive at $14 for a cheese pizza with like 6 (maybe 8?) small pieces, it is amazing. I am ready to take back everything I said and bow to the Public Market gods.  Third visit: I crave the pizza so I go back a few days later. Another $14. That's fine. But this pizza has almost no cheese on it and is burned on the bottom. They are so busy that I can't find anyone to help me so I just eat a few pieces and toss it. I am over the obsession."}
{"text":"I love this is awesome love the food and the atmosphere is the best! Highly recommend the chorizo biscuits and gray!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and I was very excited to try this new fabulous looking place. The line wasn't too long but still took a while since the people in front of us could not make up their mind and there was only one of the two registers open on a Saturday night. I ordered the pot pie which was delicious and a side of crispy sweet potatoes. When they delivered our food they brought me a baked sweet potato.   I told him I ordered the crispy potatoes and he said that's what this is.  I know what a baked potato looks like, a little more training is needed here apparently.  I made him take it back to get the crispy sweet potatoes and he brought the baked potato back stating they don't serve crispy sweet potatoes at night. What! Then why is it on the menu and why did that gal at the register not tell me that?  My husband ordered the superfood salad with chicken and of course it came out with no chicken and very small.  Also it is a little expensive for the area. Great happy hour prices though, we might be back for happy hour but not for dinner."}
{"text":"Just ok. I don't like that I have to order drinks from the bar ( vs a server ). But the atmosphere is good"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on Sunday for breakfast.  It was our first time here.  I ordered The Flanched Flarney Garney, hands down the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had.  The eggs were rich, combined with the sharpness of the cheese and the creaminess of the avocado it was a match made in heaven!  My BF ordered The Rooster Booster, basic eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast.  It was just okay.  He only received one slice of toast (99 % of the time you receive 2 pieces)  and it did not have butter nor did they offer butter on the side. I also ordered a side of crispy potatoes, they were very crispy - but did lack flavor.  I took them home and I will doctor them up for another meal. I was disappointed in how many flies were flying around...we sat  INSIDE the restaurant.  There were at least 30 flies just on the side of the restaurant we sat on.  You might have better luck with fewer flies if you sit outside ;) All in all, I think it was a pretty good place.  A bit pricey for the area but we will be back to check out their lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place yesterday after work, decided to try some food. Pizza was pretty good. Atmosphere is amazing all of their food is locally sourced. I came back this morning to try their coffee bar, WOW! Absolutely delicious! Staff was super friendly, latte was far less $$$ than some of those chain spots. Coffee is also local from Tucson. Check this spot out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. My food was tasty and served at the perfect temperature, and they even let me sample a soup that I wasn't sure if I wanted or not. I got an Arnie palmer and the servers continuously came back and got me refills--amazing for a fast casual place where you're not waited on. Every employee was friendly and helpful. The atmosphere of the place is amazing--has a great curated feel that reminded me of my favorite cafes in Minneapolis."}
{"text":"Tempe Public Market has a little bit for everyone. There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, with a dog friendly patio. They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as some delicious looking desserts in a glass case. In addition to their bar they also have a coffee bar.   You order at the counter and pay first. We chose to sit inside since it was getting warm outside. I had the frittata and had a bite of the Devil's mess.   The frittata was a large portion, filled with fresh, perfectly cooked vegetables, arugula and soft eggs. The Devil's mess was good as well, and I liked the combination of chorizo with scrambled egg.  The vibe inside is upbeat, with a few TVs and when we were eating here the music was on the cusp of being too loud for me. For me personally if I'm at a restaurant I don't want my ears to be drowned out by music if it's breakfast time and I want a peaceful relaxing morning with the person I'm eating with. If I go again I'll probably check out the patio and maybe bring the pups to try more from their menu."}
{"text":"5 star location for sure! I'm a frequent visitor to the area and absolutely loved their outdoor seating with the glorious misters keeping things cool. They have a large patio with a bar on the inside and outside and a fireplace for the cooler evenings.   As first timers it's a little bit odd. Luckily a lot of people seem confused when they walk in and the staff does a good job of finding us and bringing us a menu, huddling us up and giving us the scoop while we stand by the door. Note: you order up front and they bring everything after though it's not obvious when you walk in.   Food was pretty good. I had a bun less burger with guacamole and loved every bite. Once seated, the waitstaff brings you refills on drinks from the bar and constantly checks up.   We had a great time hanging out and chatting. Happy Hour runs to 6pm. With tips, 3 drinks a piece and entrees for all 5 we were under $150. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Omg yes!!!!!!! As an avid customer to Phoenix Public Market I had high hopes for TPM. I went the second week they where open and during lunch. Big mistake. The line was super long and I also didn't see a specific place to pick up phone orders. That means if you order over the phone you still have to stand in line. Regardless of the line and the abnormally long wait to get my lunch. The food was amazing! I got the fried chicken sandwich and butternut squash soup. I have to say that the chicken sandwich was the best I have ever had! I will be going back soon, just not during lunch."}
{"text":"Live and let bee!  My family enjoyed a night out for there soft opening which EXCEEDED our expectations. Combined we ordered salmon, the cubano and flatbread. The entrees were delicious, the drinks are unique, tasty and strong. We will 100% return to try breakfast and lunch when they open next week.  If you decide to enjoy drinks+dinner here, order the Live&let bee it has yummy crunchy bee pollen, lavender, honey + gin = win/win"}
{"text":"Great outside seating area. Inside the sound bounces from the ceiling and walls. It needs some acoustic absorption. The menu is too much like Panera bread."}
{"text":"Tempe Public Market Cafe is supposed to be the savior of south Tempe's alleged culinary woes. I haven't been convinced. Al fresco dining during Arizona's winters is great and the Cafe's roaring fire is definitely appealing. The music was distractingly loud though, and we had to raise our voices just to have a conversation. We both ordered the fried chicken sandwich (no pizzas were available the night we went) with a side of french fries -- all of which was very tasty -- but we paid $32 plus tip for two chicken sandwiches, one order of french fries, and a can of Diet Coke.  I know the zeitgeist regarding the Cafe (\"We were forced to drive from south Tempe to Phoenix just to eat\") means we should've paid our bill of $32 plus tip and thanked the Cafe for granting us the opportunity to eat there, but, come on. The food is good but overpriced and there ARE plenty of restaurants in south Tempe that offer better value for food-buying dollars and more variety on their menus."}
{"text":"Very DISAPPOINTED with my order of Lentil Curry soup. The soup was good but the serving size was NOT!! Because the menu offers both a cup a bowl size serving I made sure to ask the person taking my order to show me the difference before I placed my order. I was so excited to see how big a BOWL was and couldn't wait!! Unfortunately, I was beyond DISAPPOINTED When my soup came to the table. I couldn't believe how little soup actually comes in a \"BOWL.\" I called over a service person who took the soup back and brought me a new bowl.  To my shock It was exactly the same amount as before! This time the server told me that it's a 10 oz serving to a bowl compared to a 6 oz in a cup.  My suggestion would be to maybe serve the \"bowl\" sized serving in a smaller bowl so you don't feel like you're serving a cup size but just in a bowl.  That being said, the soup was great! This picture is of the bowl before I took my first bite!"}
{"text":"Technically, something went wrong at some point where me and my friend ended up waiting longer than expected and realized there was a mistake.  However, the manager handled it exactly how I myself would have handled it when I was a restaurant manager.  It was very professional, extremely sincere, and was fixed right away.  That's is all I would ever want in a situation like that.  The food was much better then we anticipated and we ended up getting desert.  Also empty tables were maintained all night and the place was beautiful with the lights and music this evening."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a light bite and to enjoy the outside patio before it gets to hot in the Valley of the Sun.  The first few times I tried to stop by, it was too busy to stay, fortunately the new restaurant storm of people has passed.  Overall pretty disappointed with the food, the habanero wings while crispy but had no heat and were cloyingly sweet, in fact the chicken quesadilla had better fire although the barely a teaspoon of guacamole on the side was a bit sad, either provide a reasonable scoop or take it out of the dish.  As I live in the neighborhood, I really wish them success by compared to the downtown Phoenix Public Market, the food misses the mark."}
{"text":"BEWARE:  Items marked gluten free are NOT. After asking a few questions, the server admitted that the chips are not gluten free, the fries are not gluten free, etc. I advised her that they should not then be marked as gluten free on their menu. She said, \"I know.\"   Also, totally below par food and coffee. Not worth the crowd or the prices. Total disappointment."}
{"text":"Had roasted salmon dish and it was delish. Was not prepared for an order then seat yourself style, so waiting about 15 minutes to order (on a busy night). Food was served at different times, my food came out when my table was half way done with their food. So one draw back. Overall, nice staff, good fresh food. Prepared for ordering style for next time."}
{"text":"Great new business that has totally revived this part of town. I work near here and it's breathed life back into an otherwise defunct plaza."}
{"text":"Not safe for Celiacs!  Having Celiac Disease I have to be careful about where I eat out.  Seeing lots of identified gluten free choices on the online menu I thought I could give it a try.  We took several gals there for my sister's birthday.  As we finally got through the line to order (and this took a LONG time) the manager informed us that the identified gluten free nachos (and fries) were fried in oil that other gluten containing food was also fried in.  Therefore they were cross contaminated.  I thought this was very short sighted menu labeling.  I told him whenever I see a fried food labeled gluten free I assume it is fried in a dedicated fryer.  As I tried to choose another gluten free meal the manager expressed concern that they do pizzas and have flour flying in the air and that the lines are very prone to cross-contamination.  We talk it through and I decided to try the chicken and mashed potato dish (labeled at gluten free).  He gave specific instructions to the kitchen to be careful when preparing.  It was very tasty but alas, I awoke in the night to a stomach ache and some nausea and have had some issues this morning.  If I had to guess, I'd say I was glutened.  They definitely need to revamp the menu, removing some gluten free labels and adding the obligatory \"eat at your own risk\" statements saying they have heavily glutened food prep area.  I will definitely not be eating here again (which is sad as the environment is great and the Prickly Pear Tea is fabulous).  Thankfully Picasso's is up the road and offers a totally safe eating experience.    All that said, I have to say the manager was extremely kind and concerned about getting things right.  I fully realize that I took a risk eating there and do not fault them for my getting sick...I understood the situation and decided to do it anyway.  The manager comped the difference between the nachos and chicken dinner and really tried to help me out.  But I did want to inform other Celiacs or those with bad gluten allergies that this is not the place for you.  I trust that the management will also get more serious about having their menu reflect that they are not safe for such people."}
{"text":"I don't know if they're still working out the kinks, but I'm not super impressed here.   1. What's up with the flies. I know you can't control all the pests when the doors get open and closed all the time, but there is an ungodly amount of flies inside the building.  We literally moved outside to get away from the flies.    2. Food takes forever to come out. You wait in a line that take forever to get though then you have to wait to get your food. All I ordered was the Rooster Booster which is eggs, toast, bacon, and potatoes. Took over 45 minutes for food to arrive.   3. Food is decent.  Staff is friendly, but those pros don't outweigh the cons.  The manager on duty was very polite. She offered me a refund, but I declined as the food arrived as I went to speak with her, so I feel taking a refund at that point wouldn't have been appropriate.   I really don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"The highly anticipated opening of Tempe Public Market has occurred and the green restaurant staff are serving the hordes of hungry patrons. Guests order at the counter, take a table top number, and wait for the food to arrive. All six in our party were happy with the result. There is also a bar for alcoholic drinks and happy hour every day. The non-alcoholic drinks are selected in line, other than water and the iced teas. The Sun Devil fries are good for sharing. For the most part, the food is comfort food with some healthy ingredients to enable you to feel good about yourself. The sangria had a cinnamon taste, perfect for the warm winter weather. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This very modern & trendy spot is a perfect addition to this neighborhood! I've never had a bad meal here..   Cool indoor and outdoor patio space with fireplace..  order at the counter and your food is delivered to your table .. all you can drink flavored teas (passion is my favorite)   On today's visit I had the potpie. . Pork chile Verde .. YUM! the crust was buttery flaky deliciousness the filling was flavorful full of meat .. its baked daily in limited quantities .. it's a must try!!   They also have a delicious fried chicken sandwich with pickles .. that is tasty and big lunch portion!! With what i call fancy salad .. lots of dark green leaves.  At Breakfast .. they serve this amazing jam with toast.. try it you won't be disappointed!!   It's crowded and busy here all the time because the food is good.. so bring your patience!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fun, friendly, hip and good for all ages. A great addition to our neighborhood! Brings up property values with being so nice and fun."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast because we knew it would be super busy the first weekend after they opened. They only had one cashier open and she was having problems taking people's orders so the line was very slow--that was OK, everyone has to learn in the beginning. We ordered the breakfast sandwiches and the poptart; figuring out how to get coffee was too difficult and everyone was confused so we skipped that. We were served our food fairly quickly and the food tasted OK. Nothing fantastic--certainly seemed overpriced. My mother was a big fan of the poptart surprisingly. I thought it was just meh. Not sure what all the hype is about this place; maybe just that it has taken it such a long time to open??? We'll try the dinner menu sometime in the future once things calm down a bit."}
{"text":"Love the decorations, not a fan of the food. Good for a business lunch or a short get together. Very convenient, not for foodie in me."}
{"text":"We went back to this place in hopes the experience would be better than the first. After a poor yelp review one of the managers mailed me a gift card due to the bad service and the place just being chaotic! We spent  a good 40 some dollars in there our first time. We went back yesterday for breakfast and to much of my disappointment the gift card did not even cover one entree! It was for 10 dollars! At least cover an entree! The food is not good. No flavor, super small portions . My boyfriend ordered a quinoa breakfast bowl and it was enough to fill up a toddler. We added potatoes to it which cost 3.00 ( we got about 3 chunks of potatoes) in the meal. Ending up costing about 13.00 for a measly breakfast bowl!!! I had the breakfast burrito. Again very bland and it was served with 3 grapes. Ordered two coffees and the coffee was horrible! Meal still cost us 23.00. Overpriced food for small portions and it's not even good  food! Don't see this place lasting long!!! We won't be back !!!!"}
{"text":"Look there isn't much in the area, it has a great look and feel from the street and the menu looked to be nosh snob friendly. This ended up being the foodie equivalent of a bad Hollywood blockbuster.... initial excitement and hype, great trailers and lots of shine.... Only to be followed by bad acting, poorly executed special effects and a plot that went nowhere.  The only bright spots were the service and the fact that they had PBR in a can..(yes even well travelled foodies beer slum).  The pizza was meh at best. The fries were acceptable. The pasta was well.... I knew I shouldn't have ordered it...but like dating a stripper on parole (yes I know...but....), sometimes you refuse to listen to that little voice in your head until it is too late....  If you are in a pinch and need a place with a long wait and great ambiance and decent'ish food this isn't a bad decision...  But if it burns later, don't say I didn't warn you..."}
{"text":"First visit. We sat at the bar and had a super helpful bartender who suggested a local wine and some good menu choices. Everything came out timely, looked and tasted great. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. Service was nice, felt like it was overpriced for what was offered. Salad was average at best.  Would not come back .  Wine was an extremely weak poor at best.  Was really a glorified cafeteria."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a traditional breakfast place, this isn't it. Breakfast choices are lacking and way overpriced for what you get. Also be prepared to yell your conversation to whomever you are with due to the music being up so loud at 9AM. The only reason for two stars is the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Don't let the 3 stars scare you away - there is a good chance you will find something that you like.  After all, it is a great location and has a great patio on which to have a beer and take it easy. I had read much about the Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie, but ours was barely acceptable.  The pork could have been trimmed better to remove the fat and gristle, and it was missing the southwest seasonings that most have come to expect. The Sun Devil Fries were good and plentiful, but only 2 of the dipping sauces were to our liking and one of those was catsup.   At our table someone had the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, but found it dry.  My wife suggested that we could split one in the future and just add more coleslaw to give it moisture ... but coleslaw is currently not an available side. So far the best thing we have had is the Devil's Mess breakfast - everything goes better with chorizo - and breakfast is served until 3 pm. Next time we will have a beer and split the The Rancher pizza to see if we can raise the star rating."}
{"text":"The place looked cute from outside but that's it. The parking lot is a cluster - I parked and then had to walk in the dirt to get to the front door. Which apparently there are 2 front doors. What?  The line was long which was fine being it's Sunday morning/afternoon - very slow moving and you're blocking the the front door and the bathrooms so people are constantly trying to get around you.  You also can't tell if it's a sit down restaurant or a stand in line, get a number and sit. Apparently it's both but it's not clear and no employees are going to help you out no matter how obvious it is that you've never been there before.  The line is super slow moving and you can't see what other people are eating until you are basically next in line to order. Nothing looked good - everything was super dry and bland looking. The only thing I was considering was the Tito's Cuban (based on a yelp photo I saw) but when I saw a man eating it I decided against it.  The fried chicken sandwich was the only thing that was a maybe - so when I went to order that they said they were out of the chicken salad and chicken. Literally nothing anyone was eating looked good so even though I committed all that time waiting in line I decided to go to the crepe place across the street."}
{"text":"We went to Tempe Public Market Cafe for the first time today for breakfast and I couldn't have been more impressed. All ingredients are local and fresh, and it really resonates with the amazing taste of their dishes. The service was top notch, as was the atmosphere and overall allure of the cafe."}
{"text":"Beautiful new cafe. I got the chicken sandwich and fries. Sat outside for lunch in January. Doesn't get much better than this! A little pricey for lunch but comparable with the type of food and location. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"So here's the scoop... for weeks I've been eyeing this place as I head to the gym just across the way in the parking lot. Lots of construction, looks of dirt and then one day,  saw the signage go up and knew what to expect. One of my fav spots downtown is the Phoenix Public Market Cafe so when I learned this was an extension, I couldn't be happier than to see this place make it way to my neighborhood.   So I came in on Thursday and learned they had a soft opening the night before and that the grand opening was scheduled for Friday, Jan 12... After my gym workout, I thought to sneak in a drink & dinner at the outdoor bar.   The overall layout is great. You can order when you 1st come in and then head to a table or go directly to the bar which seats both inside and outside. Outside at the bar, I had a nice view of 2 TV's with basketball on and decided to order a Cafe Fresh Juice... I got Hulk seeing how I just came from working out which had spinach, celery, green apple, kale, parsley, lemon, and cucumber... They make and package in the morning but I was fortunate that they had one in the late afternoon. A bit pricey at $6.50 but it was worth it.   Happy hour starts at 4pm and I saw a few items of interest from the people around me. Instead, I had the Salmon with mashed potatoes and seasoned veggies. The ideal meal after a workout right... it was on point and very delicious. It wasn't fishy tasting and the wedge of lemon sealed the deal as it was perfect throughout. No salt or pepper needed for the mashed potatos or fresh veggies. The atmosphere was great as everyone seated by the bar interacted with the bartenders and one another as we looked at even sampled some of everyone's food.   Looking forward to coming back to try the Chicken Freid Sandwich, nachos, and special fries as part of Happy Hour. No major issues, but with a new spot opening you always expect a few kinks during the 1st few weeks....c"}
{"text":"Rooster Booster! My go to after my workouts. Order it poached with crispy bacon! The potatoes are cooked perfectly. Real Potatoes without grease!  Bravo TPMC!"}
{"text":"It was ok, I went with a group of friends on a Saturday. We went for brunch and the food took forever. I only ordered a bagel so I can't speak to the quality of the food really. However, my friends were not impressed with their meals. The staff was friendly so, the next time I want to go have coffee and desserts with a friend, I'll come here. Really nice-looking place."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was good. Environment wast good. Management was good. I think you get the message. Be prepared to wait, at least on Sunday if you go around noon. I'll be back. Just stopped in for a bite after a bike ride with TBL Major Taylor Phoenix Riders."}
{"text":"It's definitely a treat to have a downtown kind of eating place in uber-suburban far south Tempe. The Café is very open-air with lots of outdoor seating and a big fireplace. It opened just a few days ago and the line was long, so we saved a lot of time by sitting and eating at the big bar, which is a perfectly fine option. Thumbs up for their use of locally sourced ingredients. Prices are reasonable and the bartenders are very friendly. They were out of a few menu choices by 7 pm, but in their defense they have been hammered thus far! If only they'd had a few more gluten-free items on the menu (especially desserts, and maybe a GF bottled beer option, not just cider, at the bar), this celiac would have rated them 5 out of 5. We'll be back soon though."}
{"text":"Looked forward to a new place close to home but disappointed. Nice venue but fear it would be unpleasant during hotter months as it is fully open. Outside tables are facing the wrong direction so sun was directly in your face. Tried to order a decaf coffee but they don't have it. Who doesn't serve decaf options these days? Ordered the frittata which was tasty but definitely not a frittata- an open omelet with the filling on top. Got a coupon for a free pop tart which was appreciated but the girl tried to serve one which was burnt but did replace it when I asked. Server was helpful to start getting us water and utensils. Friend's coffee was slopped into saucer. Glad we asked for real cups otherwise you get a paper cup, appears no refills. I know we sat a long time talking but got the distinct feeling from the server that he wanted us to move on. I doubt I will be back, sorry, it was not inspiring."}
{"text":"2 stars for the wait and cold food on a carry-out order.  Do not attempt to order pizza along with other hot food items.  They will be cold by the time you get home and I live down the street from them.  My daughter decided to grab a carry-out around 8pm this past Friday.  I ordered Friday's pizza special, Margherita, Sun Devil Fries and a ballerina cookie; my daughter ordered the fried chicken.Paid and sat down near the ice machine.  About 15 minutes later, a carry-out (bagged)   order was dropped off on the counter next to the machine, there were 2-3 staffers standing near by; looked at it but didn't pick it up nor call out any numbers.  Another 5 mins went by and WE were wondering if that was our order but it was missing the pizza.  A full 25 mins went by before the staffer that took our order also gave us the same bag (that was sitting there) with the pizza.  We left, the pizza was warm/hot but not the chicken or the fries by the time we got home.  We had to re-heat both.  This must be something the kitchen hasn't figured out the timing when a pizza is order with other food.  I was there with a group of friends during opening night and 2 pizzas were order, they came out about 20 minutes AFTER the rest of the table received their food.  While I can excuse this happening on open night because it was crazy busy, it's 4 months later and the kitchen logistics should've worked out all the kinks.     Why didn't we go back--we were too tired that night.    Two things that annoyed me: 1.  It  wasn't busy and the none of the 2-3 staffers hanging around the ice machine took the initiative to ask the kitchen WHEN the pizza was going to be ready or thought to return the rest of the order back to the kitchen because it would be cold.  2.  If the kitchen knows it takes the 20-25 minutes for the pizza, why would  the rest of the kitchen fill the rest of the order and have it sit on the counter getting cold and soggy?  I hope the managers fixes this problem. The cookie was great, though."}
{"text":"The service is ok, unless you are sitting on the patio where one person is assigned to walk by and grab order, except they never really come to the tables to ask if you need anything, you have to seek them out. I love the atmosphere, the drinks, the food. The place is new, there is room for growth, but I love supporting local places and this is a marvelous spot!"}
{"text":"Very excited for the grand opening of one of my favourite restaurant groups!   We go to the Phoenix Public Market Cafe quite a bit- and the South TEMPE location is perfect for an area surrounded by chain restaurants.  Aaron Chamberlin and team kept the commitment to local vendors with items from Iconic Cocktail Company, McClendon's, Hayden Flour Mill and Peanut butter Americano.  New location is beautiful- with quite a large patio.  A new change from downtown- is that this location offers wood fired pizza! Food is delicious as always.  My favorite things in the menu:  Breakfast (healthy and non healthy): Chorizo & Eggs, biscuits & gravy (made with Chorizo) or the quinoa bowl with poached eggs (to be healthy).   Sandwiches: Cubano  Snacks: Pretzels and cheese or colours of the rainbow (vegetable platter)- again non healthy to healthy.  Dinner: Salmon or fried chicken or roast chicken or specials!  Seriously- the menu is great... but let's talk dessert! Their pastry chef is AMAZING! - homemade pop tarts (seriously amazing) - ballerina cookies (Made with nut flour) - macaroons"}
{"text":"We were very excited about this restaurant opening. We visited for lunch on a slow Sunday afternoon. There was no one in front of us when we ordered yet it took over 25 minutes to receive our sandwiches. It then took another 15 minutes before our fries came out.   Very unimpressed with the food. Small portions with unremarkable flavors. And there was no manager around for us to speak with.   I will not be returning to this location"}
{"text":"Food was very good each time we went their, service was exceptional, even for a place were you have to order yourself at the register.     My only major complaint was the high prices.    If I was so rich, that it didn't matter, this place would be a 5 star."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the Phoenix Public Market Cafe; I almost never make it out to Tempe anymore but on opening weekend my friend and I decided to check it out! When I first got in there, it was so busy that a staff member came up to me and asked, \"Are you looking for someone?\"  And I said, \"Yes, my friend...\" scanning the room.  And she said, \"Is it Michelle?\"  And I'm like, \"No, Andrea...\"  I guess I wasn't the only one lost and confused amidst the buzzing of the crowd. No, seriously! I only told this tidbit of a story because that's how freakin' packed it was. It was the middle of the afternoon on a Saturday and the line snaked out the door.  I finally found my friend and we stood in line. 15 minutes passed...then 30...then 45! Yes, my dear Yelp friends, I stood in line for 45 minutes for food, something I only ever do if food is amazing. When we were finally helped, we both ordered Pancho Villa juices, which had jalepeno and pineapple in them. I ordered the Chile Pork Verde Pot Pie, a house specialty and my friend ordered the spicy chicken sandwich. The Chile Pork Verde Pot Pie tasted good, it had large chunks of pork in them and a good kick to it. My friend reported her spicy chicken sandwich tasted amazing and was worth the wait. We were both happy with our spicy jalepeno green juices, too! Overall, I love the space of the place; I wish that Phoenix Public Market Cafe was as big as this one, it was so relaxing to finally sit outside in the sunshine and enjoy our food. I can't say I'll be back to this location because I live way closer to the Phoenix one, but I could see how this could be a chill place to come and relax -hopefully not with a 45 minute wait on opening weekend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for late lunch last weekend, and was pretty excited to try this place. I was really hoping the experience would be as great as the atmosphere. The decor is great, I love the open outdoor patio and the look of the market. We each ordered a coffee, one being an espresso and the other a cold brew. Both were fantastic. However, our name was never called, or wasn't called loud enough but I happened to walk to the bar and they were ready. I ordered a Mediterranean salad, and added chicken. Overall the salad was really delicious and the dressing was really light and not overwhelming. I think the price was a little high, but not too out of the norm.  So, two thumbs up for atmosphere, coffee, and my salad.   Here's the downside. My husband ordered a grilled cheese, and paid $4 for a side salad. This was a JOKE!! Seriously. If you're going to put a grilled cheese on the regular menu, not the kids menu, then you better make it worth it. There were two small slices of bread, and cheese only on half. No kidding. And the side salad: a small cup of lettuce, a few shredded carrots, and 1 half of a cherry tomato. Come on. For $4? My husband was super disappointed and left hungry.  Also, no forks on the tables and none in the containers outside at a little bussing station. Had to wander around until I found one inside. This is just a bit of feedback for staff, didn't really bother me, but kind of a drag on the first impression.   Overall, I still think this place has some potential, and great decor. I'd give this place one more shot based on the coffee and my salad. However, if the food isn't better on the next try, my husband (and sadly I) won't be back. I'm going to give it 3 stars, mainly for the coffee and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We've been anxiously awaiting TPM to open for over a year now, as we love the Phoenix location and constantly go out of our way for meals at St. Francis. To have that caliber of restaurant within walking distance would be great, right?! If it weren't for the name, you would never guess this place has anything in common with the other two. We've gone for breakfast twice now, and walked away extremely disappointed both times. We've never had to battle the long lines everyone else mentions, so this review is just on the layout and food. Our service there has actually been ok, as well. First, let people know that they need to grab silverware and water themselves, regardless of where they're sitting. It seems minor, but literally every person can be heard muttering under their breath at that counter that they should have been told to do it in the first place. Second: what genius decided to stick the coffee right in the corner of the front entrance, right where the most packed location in the entire restaurant is? There's never room to maneuver to get coffee, and the waiters never seem to see if it needs to be refilled. I've had to flag down a waiter on each visit to let them know they were out. Third: flies. Seriously, figure it out already. It was bad on the first visit, and worse on the 2nd. Multiple other reviews list the same thing- we actually moved outside the second visit to escape the flies. Fourth: the breakfast menu had no imagination or execution. Some things were good, like the biscuits and gravy and the corn cake, but not near worth the prices charged. The rest of the menu is unbelievably bland. When you have 2 kids push away their food and ask if we can go somewhere else like Oink, First Watch or Crepe Bar, you have serious problems. You simply can't justify the prices with the food being put out. We'll probably give it another try because it's so new, but to say we're disappointed is an understatement."}
{"text":"High Prices, terrible service and a grilled cheese swimming in butter. avoid. Soup was ok. An extra star for trying to be cool I guess"}
{"text":"Simply put the food is AMAZING !! From the appetizers, to the pizzas, burger, or the incredible pot pie, there's something for everyone. Service and atmosphere are great !!"}
{"text":"Me and a coworker went on Tuesday and really liked the ambiance of the place.  They did an excellent job on the building and the strip center should be drawing quite the crowds now, only worries are the parking in the future.  As for the food we both enjoyed our meals and definitely will be coming back, most likely tomorrow.  I look forward to the addition of their rotisserie chicken in the future.  Anyway, I will try and snap some pics tomorrow."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The bar is great, you can't beat the ambiance or the location. Why not 5 stars?  The food. It's not terrible but it's not great either. I wish I could pin down what it is but there's just nothing on the menu I am excited to eat. But that hasn't stopped me from wanting to stop in on my way home most nights."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice for lunch. Each time I was greeted warmly.  On both times the service was exceptional, better than most. The food always came out quickly. First time I had the rice bowl and then today I had the Eat the Rainbow salad.  Both amazingly fresh and tasty. I am so happy to be able to write a happy review! I love this place."}
{"text":"Great looking restaurant. I had the Cuban for $13 bucks and another $4 to add fries. I expected spectacular at those prices and while the fries were yummy the sandwich was nothing to get excited about. Very little to this $13 sandwich. Not much meat and not much size not much of anything. Daughter had the Caesar salad with salmon and now that was delicious. I'll try something different next time. Disappointed that you have to buy canned or bottled soda."}
{"text":"JUST WHAT TEMPE NEEDED. Went close to the opening date and there was some hit and misses, but that's to be expected at first-- so glad I went a second time. Hiccups corrected, I was so impressed with the food. The service and overall vibe of the place. So glad there's a family-owned, non-chain in my hood that I can support. You've got to give the crispy chicken sandwich a try.   Also, just a great spot to get coffee and catch up on emails. Also, they've got this chocolate cake I can't stop thinking about."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Can't wait to come back and try everything. I'm not sure what kind of coffee they use but it's delicious!! I tried the biscuits and gravy this morning. OMG!! So good!! They a had a little kick to them without being too spicy. The outdoor seating area and fireplace are beautiful."}
{"text":"I love this place! This and the downtown one are amazing. This place has some of the best food in Tempe! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Just checked out the new Tempe Public Market Cafe, and it did NOT disappoint!   My husband and I ordered The Rancher pizza which was AMAZING! The crust was doughy deliciousness. We also had the Caesar salad with chicken (the chicken is like a pulled rotisserie style which is my favorite on a salad) and the cornbread croutons were perfection. Lastly, we had the salmon and vegetables. The salmon was cooked to perfection with a great array of potatoes and veggies on the side. A really great healthy alternative to pair with the pizza! Haha   The outdoor seating is awesome as well as the fireplace. Great ambiance and the service was what I would come to expect from their other location (Phoenix Public Market)... very friendly and helpful. They were quick to remove plates, which is great because I love not having to stare at my plate after I finish my meal.   Overall, \"GREAT\" experience and food!  ^ Just realized I totally over used the word \"great\" but it was all fantastic, so whatever. ;-P"}
{"text":"Love this place ! Have an amazing pizza and vegan options as well , which is amazing !"}
{"text":"The quinoa bowl was terrific - so many veggies, and topped with 2 nicely poached eggs. Their version of a PB&J (with almond butter, apples, and jelly) looked great - and fun! Was not so impressed with the Flanched Flarney Garney (although the name is great fun) - it's a breakfast sandwich. Meh.  Best of all is the service. The staff are friendly and helpful - offered to turn the music down \"a notch\" for my older friend's benefit. They're been exceptional every time."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but I just can't. The place is always busy and I don't really understand why? My first visit we ordered a breakfast burrito and it was seriously lacking... especially for the price. It was just a burrito on a white plate. Definitely a lack of presentation but I figured it would probably be delicious. The burrito was extremely bland. No salsa or anything.  We decided to give this place a second shot. I ordered the AZ burger. Still not impressed. There's plenty of places in the area to get a burger and this place doesn't even compare.  I feel like this place is catered to the wrong demographic for the area. I'm in my 30s and I even found the music that they play extremely annoying. All I could think about was how I wanted to leave. The setup seemed like it was catered to those in their early 20s. Maybe it's great for some but this is not my type of place... which is a bummer because we live right down the street."}
{"text":"So I'll be 100% honest with my review. After driving past this place several times in the last few weeks, I was extremely excited to try them out. Tonight my partner and a friend came in for dinner after being on the road for 6 hrs from Los Angeles. We were tired and hangry. So we ordered one of their pan pizzas two cubano sandwiches and a chicken salad sandwich. We ordered the food at 7:20 and didn't get our pizza until almost and hour later, followed by the chicken salad sandwich and then a few minutes later the manager tells us they are out of the Cubanos in which he gave a 20 dollar gift card for the trouble which we appreciated. We then ordered a burger and a fried chicken sandwich but they were out of the chicken so we just had another chicken salad sandwich and the burger packed up. He did comp the entire bill and asked us to give them another chance which we will. The place has potential. Sorry the first impression wasn't as great as I had hoped. We will be back"}
{"text":"As excited as I was for the location to open I'm equally disappointed with their delivery. I'm a big fan of the chef and often drive up to St. Francis for breakfast & dinner so was looking forward to the location opening in my neighborhood.  I understand that during openings they need to work through things but my overall rating still takes that into account. This is a counter order format and they shouldn't have all of the service problems and the menu is limited and some of the food coming out shouldn't come out. I've visited for breakfast, lunch & dinner and have seen the same issues in service & inconsistent food.   Atmosphere - This is why I'm giving it two stars. Great work at the location. My only comment is to get enough chairs on the patio so that we can use all the tables they have.  Service - Lacking in all areas. If the line is out the door then open the 2nd register, common sense. Even though I know what I'm ordering the order taking process is painful which is why there are open seats in the restaurant but a long, long line. The food runners do nothing more than drop the plate. They don't ask if you need anything or announce what they are delivering. During our four person breakfast there was a 15 minute gap between the first plate and the last, and none of the runners ever said anything about the next dish coming out.   Food - Interesting menu but poor execution. AZ Burger - Cooked well enough and enjoyed the house dressing, but not a fan of the bun they use. The issue is the price/value when you have to order fries. The cost of the side for such a small serving is annoying considering what they charge for the burger. Add the side. The Rancher Pizza - The only highlight so far and have had it twice. It is a pan baked pizza where it is really doughy. The sausage and pepperoni is what makes it so good. Would like a little more sauce but it's work ordering again. The Devil's Mess - Not sure what to say, it's a mess. Biscuits & Gravy - Probably would have been better if the gravy came out something hotter than lukewarm. A single biscuit. Not worth what they are charging .  Frittata - Bad. It was skillet cooked and the outside edges were way overcooked and in center was under cooked. The bad part was the too large hunks of under cooked broccoli that they put on it.  Lacked flavor. Flarney Garney - Good enough but not very good. Tito's Cubano - A too small piece of under seasoned pork and a small slice of ham. The dijonnaise added some flavor but not enough to save the dish at that price, again without a side.   Beverages - Beer selection is so so. The Sangria is way overpriced for the quality of a 4 oz pour after you take out the ice.  For breakfast the drip coffee is a disaster. If you order drip coffee you have to self serve out of air pots that were either empty of lukewarm. And, the coffee didn't meet my personal preference.   I hope that they figure things out because the neighborhood needs a location like this. But if the quality of food doesn't improve, the service improve and they balance the quality/price then I'll look else ware."}
{"text":"\"For every minute you are angry, you lose sixty seconds of happiness.\"  Tell yourself this while you wait in line because that line is fierce.  Ah, the latest restaurant from chef Aaron Chamberlin.  We had to pop in!  A group of us came on their Grand Opening, January 12th.  Earlier in the day, they had ran out of food and had to reopen at 5PM.  At least that means the food was fresh, right?  The five of us ordered:  House Pretzels - Handmade pretzels with a jalapeno white cheddar sauce. $7.50:  These were pretty great.  They're not the best cheese and pretzels in town but the cheese sauce was excellent.  The blend itself was nice but the texture was a bit grainy.  The pretzels were also salty and good.  Lentil Curry Coconut Soup. $8:  I would pass on this.  It's nothing memorable and tastes exactly how you would imagine it would:  like curry!  I was hoping for more coconut flavor.  Side of French Fries. $4:  These were ordered by mistake.  We had wanted to try the Sun Devil Fries.  Don't get me wrong though, the fry on these babies were perfect.  It had a crispy exterior and creamy interior.  We sprinkled on some Parmesan cheese and they were devoured.  Brick Pressed Chicken - Garlic mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach with a lemon thyme sauce. $16.50:  One of the disappointments of the night.  I'm glad Amber R. ordered this and not me, hah!  This bird had no seasoning on it whatsoever.  You would think the lemon thyme sauce would be sufficient but it wasn't.  Even tossing on some salt and pepper didn't save it.  It needs Jesus to be saved.  I will say that the chicken was juicy.  The potatoes had no garlic taste either.  Fried Chicken - Mixed greens and mashed potatoes. $16:  This was so Gucci.  I didn't think I'd be wowed by $16 fried chicken but it was good!  No bone, white meat, and crunchy.  I'd order this again.  The Rancher - Scheiner's sausage, pepperoni, cheese blend, house made tomato sauce. $16:  This was delicious.  That sausage was flavorful and fatty and it made my skirt flip.  It was an excellent wood-fired pie.  Farmers Market Pizza. $13 - Braised leeks, mozzarella blend, shaved Brussels sprouts, Parmesan, Meyer lemon, chives. $13:  Although this is a vegetarian pizza, I didn't miss the meat.  It was a very light and refreshing pie and it made me feel good.  Definitely squeeze the lemon on top for a bright note of flavor.  We also had the Live And Let Bee [gin, honey, lavender, lemon juice], Monsoon Season [Kraken black spiced rum, lime, ginger beer], and a Sangria [red wine, brandy, fresh juices, seasonal fruit] at $8 each.  I gotta say I wasn't impressed with the cocktails.  For the most part, the flavors weren't balanced.  I'd pass on cocktails here.  We also got a free cookie as per their Facebook post.  Oh and the macarons were pretty tasty too.  So the staff here are beyond friendly and work very efficiently.  The food had some hits and misses, the price point is on the higher side, but I wouldcome back once the hype dies down and/or come during off-peak hours.  Welcome to Tempe, TPMC! 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Man, I really want to say that I had an enjoyable experience but maybe next time...if there is a next time? I gave this review three stars largely because I've enjoyed my past experiences at Phoenix Public Market and I know my experience at Tempe could have been better. I was out of town opening weekend or else I would've been there. In seeing a line when I got there, it didn't look terrible so I swiftly got in line started my watch to count the time. For how short the lined looked, the wait was much longer than I was expecting. In total, I waited 30 minutes in line to order. I then proceeded to wait 40 minutes for my food. Eek. I honestly thought they forgot about my order and finally flagged someone down to check on it.   I ordered the rice bowl and my friend got a the superbowl salad. When we got our food, my friend said, \"I waited this long and they couldn't even cut my vegetables smaller?\" Hmm, she was right. In my case, the raw veggies were layer on top of a bed of rice. Don't get me wrong, the rice bowl was decent. The rice was a good texture and veggies were fresh but the vinaigrette had a little kick (I think it was ginger or red pepper flakes?) that wasn't specified on the menu. Since it was unexpected, I didn't use much and basically ate a bowl of raw veggies. That's all I can really say about the food. Maybe my expectations were too high?  In combination of the wait time and taste, I know I've had better."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday around 10AM, we ordered three lattes & it took at least 25 minutes just to get our coffees. We even checked on the coffee a couple times to make sure we were being forgotten. Then about after 35 minutes we finally got our food. Other than that the environment is really nice & a great place to be outside especially when the weather is nice. It would've been s better experience if it didn't take so long to get everything. We honestly would've been happy if we got our coffee within a decent amount of time."}
{"text":"Load and overpriced average food. Not even in the neighborhood of the Phoenix cafe, this Tempe location is hip, slick, and not so cool."}
{"text":"Beautiful outdoor seating!!  Very cozy and inviting!  Decided to try something new and a little more healthy and glad we stopped in.  Being new restaurant, it was busy but the service staff was handling it great. I had the rice bowl which was delish!! I tried a new drink, Captain America and that was very good.  My new go to place!"}
{"text":"had a private party here.  service was very good.  food was okay. fine if you live near but I wouldn't go out of my way"}
{"text":"The place itself is awesome. Love the set up. The service and staff were all great. That's the plus. The downside, they should have two working registers for how busy this place it. No reason they shouldn't be working. The person at the register should know how to take orders in a timely manner, it took way too long.   The food: bland. The crispy chicken sandwich was crispy but absolutely no flavor. Did they skip on the Dijon? The presentation was there but that's it. Overpriced.   The nachos, I've had better. Barely any toppings compared to how many chips. For the price, at least add the toppings.  The green chili pot pie was spicy. One of the better dishes out of the three. The crust could be a bit more flakey.   Oh, you get your own water which they don't tell you. The ice machine was down so the ice was in a bucket melted. Having all utensils in a cup on the table is rather gross, who knows how many hands touch those things including kids. If you order a drink at the front they require two people for two drinks. Getting our drinks took the longest. Got them AFTER the food. $50 for bland, long wait to order food and drinks. I expect better."}
{"text":"Returned after a poor experience during opening week. Mid morning breakfast with my family. Service was excellent, breakfast burrito super tasty, and drinks made to order. Music on patio a bit too loud. Now on my neighborhood go to list after wondering if I would be back."}
{"text":"I was in the area and had a minute to stop in and check out this new spot locals are pumped about having in their backyard. What a cool spot!   Walking in, the first thing I noticed was all the patio seating with separate cozy spaces. Today was cooler so they actually had two fire pits going during the day, which you don't typically see here in AZ. It immediately created a \"warm\" vibe - both literally and figuratively!   Since I didn't have enough time to dine in, I opted to try two takeout options - the bacon (soft) pretzel ($5) and the lemon pound cake (around $4). You could tell the pretzels were homemade and they even had a little bit of mustard hidden on the inside - yum! The lemon pound cake was soooo moist - I know, I know, I hate that word too but I can't think of any other way to describe it, haha. Not too lemony and definitely buttery.    Prices aren't cheap. BUT, one of the things I noticed and that struck me during my short visit here was seeing how genuinely happy and enthusiastic all the employees looked. That is something I am willing to pay a little more for!"}
{"text":"Long wait for ok food.  Cuban was nothing to write home about.  Clean place."}
