{"text":"Maybe the NY style just a bit too sweet for us. And, 60 cents for a glass of iced water is just too much."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and delivery service again. Definitely a family favorite."}
{"text":"Got the  imperial seafood and it was horrible, cost me 17.00 to have it delivered across the road to my work, veggies where from a bag and the seafood was really , really chewy. I am not feeling so well after eating just a small plate. Dodge this place!"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from here, first off came 30 min late, then my wife's sweet and sour pork tasted like McDonald's chicken nuggets and there were no vegetables mixed in, it was basically just fried mystery meat, and she was not even able to eat it.  I got through my meal, the beef lo mein but it wasn't much better and is comparable to Panda Express.  Last was the wonton soup, which was in fact raw and not edible for my pregnant wife, so she's out of luck and has to heat up some leftovers now unfortunately"}
{"text":"This was a great late evening place to grab some Asian food. The food is good and hit my craving spot. I especially like the egg rolls. It is a small place for dine in, but carry out worked perfectly. Happy dining."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food! The wonton and egg drop soups are authentic and delicious. We love the shrimp fried rice-never sticky-done just right. We've tried several dishes and all have been very good but the best is the beef with snow peas and mushrooms. The most tender beef with a tasty brown sauce. Try the crab rangoons...yum! The best Chinese food in our area-bar none."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the area. Clean, friendly service. Small few tables mostly take out."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout tonight. They got part of our order wrong. I ordered spicy pork and eggplant. I received pork and every other vegetable except eggplant drowning in a bland brown sauce. 

As for the rest of our order, the beef and broccoli was average. The dumplings were... well, we're not sure what they were. They were soggy and filled with mystery meat. 

And even though it's outside of their control, my fortune cookie had no fortune in it."}
{"text":"We usually order delivery from this location.  We've tried a few different places and this is the best so far.  The family dinner combo has a great selection.  We ordered the wonton soup a couple of times but it was WAY too salty.  Otherwise this place is decent.  Delivery time is fast also."}
{"text":"Excellent food,  hot and still crispy when delivered... Courteous and happy driver,  Crab Rangoon were perfect. Everything had great flavor and was well executed. We will reorder :) Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Only place in the state of AZ with the best Chow Fun since I left CA."}
{"text":"Super fast delivery of Specialty Pad Thai & Specialty Fried Rice. Yummy, They don't include a menu unless you ask."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, fast friendly service, vegan dishes, I would come back in a heart beat!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but they charge extra to substitute tofu instead of meat. The service is fast and the price is reasonable. I just wish they had more vegetarian/vegan options!"}
{"text":"I hold this restaurant close and dear to my belly for two main reasons: first (and foremost), the food is as close to NYC Chinese takeout as I can find here in the Valley. Secondly, the store location is literally close enough to walk to from my house.

I'm a big fan of their lunch menu because of the great pricing and great flavor of most dishes on the menu. Outside of the lunch menu, the fried chicken wings as well as the pu-pu platter (which also include the wings) are very tasty. If you want healthier, there is a vegetarian section (including steamed vegetables) and also the option to have brown rice served with your meal. The brown rice tastes decent, but any sauce that they use makes the rice unbelievably savory.

Don't be misled by the owner's gruff exterior; he's a good man and you'll agree once you've become a more regular customer. Besides, most NYC takeouts are known for not having the most hospitable workers, that's the way they operate."}
{"text":"This place is right next to my house. I have been there 3 times. I have gotten the kung pao chicken, mongolian beef, and szechuan chicken. So far they all taste decent, nothing special, but the portions are HUGE. However, the downside is they give WAY too many vegetables and not enough meat in their servings.... I only go there when I need to something quick, however there are better chinese restaurants for sure."}
{"text":"Not worth a second visit; questionable cleanliness. Looking for good Chinese delivery, I suggest elsewhere.  Searched yelp for Chinese, came across this place, placed an order for delivery.  Extremely subpar food quality. Glad we ordered the lunch specials,  I would have hated to have to eat this again as leftovers.   We had orange chicken and sesame chicken.  The orange chicken is advertised as spicy.  It is not. Hardly any broccoli.  The chicken had gristle and was pretty tough at times.  The sesame chicken had a long blond hair in it.  Nobody in my family has light hair.  Also very sad to say that the fried rice was overcooked and mushy."}
{"text":"Went there about 40 minutes before closing and ordered to eat at the restaurant with the intention of just packing anything we had left over by closing, so we didn't hold them up. Not only did they not rush us, the woman at the counter kept assuring us to not to worry and take our time when we asked for to-go containers 10 minutes before closing. That alone earned a star! 

Everything looked like it was pictured. The restaurant was clean, quiet and cozy. Also, they had hand sanitizer at the counter.  They  deliver, but only to a 4 mile radius. 

We ordered 4 dishes, and it was all ready less than 15 minutes later. All were generous portion sizes for the price. I ordered the chicken lo mein. The noodles were thick, and the flavor was on point. Not too salty or greasy. I tried some of the teriyaki chicken and that was also tasty and swimming in sauce. 

My only regret was that I hadn't ordered any soup."}
{"text":"Love this place. Fast, simple, delicious. I get the sweet and sour pork. It's perfectly crunchy and the rice is so good. I would go here over Panda Express ANYTIME. Sure it's not the biggest or fanciest place, but the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"best Local secret Around a small place dont let it fool you this place Packs a PUNCH great staff Hot Fast Chinese Food good Prices"}
{"text":"I've had lunch take-out here on several occasions and I've been pleased each time. There typically aren't a lot of customers in the restaurant around mid-day so the service is always fast and the employees have been helpful and pleasant. I've never felt rushed or treated with anything but respect by the staff. The quality is great for the price you pay. The food is always hot and you get a a very generous sized portion. For around $6 you can get a lunch special that also comes with a heaping portion of pork fried rice and your choice of either a soup or a soda. 

Regarding Adria R's post, it seems her experience was a definite outlier. I'm not sure who expects a Chinese restaurant to have excellent chicken nuggets, fries, and donuts. If you stick to what they specialize in (Chinese food) I'm sure you'll be more than satisfied. Additionally, on their website they clearly state that delivery orders can take around 45 minutes to be delivered. 

All in all Grace Garden is in my opinion the best Chinese food in the area and is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Food arrived in under 30 mins after online order--piping hot! Ordered \"Chicken Amazing\" & it was! Also chicken fried rice, honey chicken, & egg rolls. All was hot & delicious! Will definitely order again (and again!)"}
{"text":"Great place, so glad that I checked yelp for a great place to have Chinese. Very friendly staff, great food, good portions and great pricing. Exactly what I was hoping for, reminds me of dining back in Ohio, and this is what I was hoping for. Will definitely frequent in the future, my new go to restaurant for Chinese."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food in the Mesa area. Always deliver fast and my order hasn't been wrong yet. Their food is the closest I've found to the east coast Chinese food yet. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Food is great and the delivery service is very fast. They always deliver hot food and much quicker than they quote on the phone when ordering. This is a great place to order on a Sunday night when I just can't make another meal"}
{"text":"I work near by and I stopped by for their lunch specials and me and a co-worker got sweet and sour pork and Mongolian beef. The portion sizes were perfect and the price for lunch was awesome. I will definitely be back for much lunches."}
{"text":"My food came out hot and fast  portion was fine  i did not like getting charged a  dollar for peanuts  a little excessive  i think   Good menu lots of choises for veggies  Steamed is a good option"}
{"text":"This will not be a place I come back to. I ordered the chicken with Chinese vegetables. The chicken was like pureed fluff cut into cubes. U didn't have to chew it hardly and it had no flavor. The veggies consisted of lots of broccoli which was tough, one baby corn, one water chestnuts, and one small mushroom, all tossed together in a greasy siracha sauce. The fried rice was ok but the rice was over cooked and a little bit mushy. The taste was ok but not great. The egg rolls aren't homemade. There store bought frozen but pretty good for just $1.25. For whatever reason I got sick any 2/3 way thru the meal and had to leave. Maybe the other dishes are better but I won't waste my money trying. The fortune cookies were fresh and fabulous tho and the fountain drink was really good. If Simi's had been open on Sunday that's where I would have been."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food ever!   Waited over 90 min for delivery to hotel then absolutely nothing tasted like it should have.   Kung pao chickens only vegetable was 2 pieces of broccoli, and it tasted like sweet &  sour chicken.  Would never recommend!"}
{"text":"Me and my family eat here often. The portions are large, the food is always hot and fresh. This is also the only place I have been to yet since leaving New York that knows the difference between an egg roll and a spring roll. I recommend this place to everyone, and many of my friends have expressed their thanks for the suggestion after they've eaten there.

Appears to be family run, everyone is polite. Only \"problem\" I ever have is when I phone in the order. The woman who answers is so soft spoken that sometimes it is hard to hear her, but my orders have never once been wrong."}
{"text":"Grace Garden is the go to authentic chinese spot in east mesa! Im a regular to the greenfield location because the food is always cooked to perfection and the service is second to nun! Hope this helped you and hope you enjoy some grace garden chinese food!"}
{"text":"We have only had delivery from Grace Garden. But it has been amazing every single time (which has been a lot of times... :) ). It is fast delivery too. It's always been hot and fresh. The delivery drivers are pretty friendly too. The portions are big too, definitely leaves you with enough for a second meal or fully stuffed if you can't stop eating."}
{"text":"First visit the other day. nice people and the food was good. You get plenty for your money. Will definatly try them again."}
{"text":"Trust me when I say do not order the sweet-and-sour chicken. You will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Had the eggplant and garlic with tofu. Great staff. No ambiance, but that's ok with me. It's very bright, small, and noisy. Not for a romantic dinner date. I will be back. Nice prices, too. I look forward to trying more things."}
{"text":"Amazing food everytime I go always fresh taste great super nice love this place best any where around you will love and huge menu lots to pick from great place"}
{"text":"I just tried the crab rangoons they are awesome fresh and as always da shrimp for egg foo young was awesome"}
{"text":"The egg foo young was a really big portion. I was pleasantly surprised. It was hot and fresh when I got it. The fried rice is also really good. The spring rolls are 2 for $1.95. Overall it was perfect and I would order from them again."}
{"text":"Grace Garden is my go to Chinese joint, the delivery is always fast and nice and the food is delicious and we have leftovers for days after eating here everytime!"}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese food! The wonton soup is great and the crab rangoons  are awesome. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place! I love it! The combo meals are really good deals with eggrolls, fried rice and a main dish. The orange and honey chicken dishes are really good. My favorite is the crab wontons and the pork dumplings. Delivery is really quick and take out is a good option too!"}
{"text":"This is our \"Go To\" Chinese take out/delivery place! Great food and friendly staff. We just moved out of their delivery boundaries :( but we still make the drive to pick up food whenever we want quick and delicious Chinese. Bar B Q spare ribs are one of our favorite!"}
{"text":"Really really yummy. Their family meal is a ridiculous amount of food for so cheap. You could feed 5 or 6 people easily and it's $33. It's hard to get good pizza for close to that price. They're really friendly too. Oh and the delivery is always on time. I've ordered probably 5 times and it's on time and hot!"}
{"text":"I am not really sure what Adria R.'s problem is, maybe she was smoking a bowl as her remark was in bad taste and not the food.  I eat here on an almost daily basis and can not get enough of the lunch specials (priced from $5 to $6, especially the L03 (shrimp and chicken combo)  which comes with a healthy helping of freshly stirred meat, veggies and choice of white or brown rice. You also have the choice of a drink or soup with that lunch special.  Other times I will just order the chicken rice soup or the chicken nuggets which are moist and ABCDelicious!  On average I eat there about five days a week and I don't gain weight but it leaves you feeling full but not like your going to bust a gut which is perfect.  Even my daughter who was staying with me for a few weeks could not get enough and she wanted to take some back to Vegas as she can not find food like this out there that tastes this good.  I refer everybody over there and the consensus from them is a 5 star rating and they go back for more!
I would not focus so much on the rare one star reviews that like to inject drug innuendos on a delivery guys looks, that is callous and vain and speaks bounds to Adria and her up in the air nose attitude.  As a matter of fact just ignore the little girl and go in and try the Grace Garden yourself.  You will love it!"}
{"text":"While staying at a hotel, we decided to try this and order for delivery.  Our driver did get a little lost, so it took 1.25 hour to get here. However, I would definitely do it again. Food was really good with great portions. Tasty, Tasty, Yum  ( just make sure they understand where you are, especially if you are in a hotel)"}
{"text":"First Chinese spot I actually like after having moved from NY. I had the general tso's lunch special and my aunt had the wonton soup and egg rolls. Fantastic! The only reason why I am not putting 5 stars instead of the 4 is because it was sooooo hot in there I actually felt like it was seriously Ny. Hot and humid. Then the lady came and took the menu I wanted to take home and she said we only needed one. Lol kinda funny but also kinda makes you think :)"}
{"text":"This place is SO quick...If you are in a hurry and feel like fast food from a drive thru is not what you want but all you have time for then try this place! Teriyaki chicken,spicy shredded beef and general chicken are my favorites but, many other options sound good too! Clean place and delivery available as well."}
{"text":"Love this place me and my husband  go every chance we can. He always gets the teriyaki chicken and I get orange chicken. The owners are so nice and very friendly."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese takeout restaurant by far! Coming from the east coast it took a while to find our favorite place, they delivered! Excellent, speedy service, fast delivery where I don't have to give the card over the phone (delivery guy brigs a credit card machine with him) great prices, and nice family feel. One time they got my order mistaken and I couldn't come back to pick up the corrected order, so they re-delivered it within15 minutes! Our regular order is beef chow fun, general tso chicken, crab rangoons, and egg foo young. We've ordered the family meal several times for when we have the entire fam over for dinner and it feeds plenty for only around $40! We recently moved further east, but continue to order takeout :)"}
{"text":"We where looking for something close and quick.

I love the fact that we could order on line with current pricing. After placing the order, drove right over. Now they where not busy, but the order was done and ready. 

The food, chicken fried rice and beef/broccoli was excellent! Great flavors, good size portions and fairly priced. This will be a goto in the future."}
{"text":"So, I opened my door yesterday to find a menu for China Garden. \"Grand Opening,\" it said, and boy, is the menu extensive, from pu pu platter to old standbys to chef's specialties, it covers more than the standard Asian fare. There are also 3 lamb dishes, chicken wings, and fried seafood platters for good measure. Prices were very reasonable, so we decided to order in lunch. (China Garden bills itself as a takeout and delivery place, but they do have a few small tables.) 

What we ordered followed by an assessment: 
*crab rangoons- have had better, have had worse. 
*egg drop soup- super simple, good texture, a tad salty for my husband, just fine for me. 
*won ton soup- the flavor of the broth wasn't the best, but the tender won tons were filled with small meatballs of flavorful pork. 
*sweet and sour pork- it came with sauce on the side, just like I would have preferred, and the pork was very tender and delicious. I ordered brown rice which was well cooked also. 
*Husband got the General Tso's tofu which he thought was just OK- he was excited to try it because we've never seen it on a vegetarian menu before, but he decided that tofu is just not well suited to that dish, and it could have been spicier. Next time we'll specify the spice level. 

All in all, the meal was fine, with my pork being the stand out. Will we order again? Sure. There's plenty on the menu to try, they are open 7 days a week, and they did not charge extra for delivery. Their delivery area is Power to Gilbert and Warner to Broadway."}
{"text":"What a great little place to get some good Chinese food. We are new to the area and are big Chinese food eaters so finding a go-to was a must for us. I believe we found it.

The portions are excellent, prices are very reasonable, the food is DELICIOUS (with incredible flavors!) and the service is impeccable. Very, very friendly!! The only reason why I can't give this establishment 5 stars is because we were only here once and we ate in. So, when we order take out or delivery, I will update my review accordingly.

Really looking forward to trying more menu options and supporting this wonderful business. Based on what the dining experience we had, I definitely can recommend this food. Truly fantastic!"}
{"text":"The first Chinese food I have found in four years since moving to AZ! I'm from Washington state, and Chinese food is some of the best around! This has been close to what we have back home. I am just glad my family can enjoy take out again."}
{"text":"I got a ton of overcooked orange chicken in the entree, which was unfortunate. If it weren't for that I would have definitely gave this place more stars. Pork fried rice was delicious and so were the vegetable rolls."}
{"text":"How does this place only have 4 stars? Delicious food! So yummy that we forgot to take a picture before chowing down. Service is great. Food came out pretty quickly. Place was clean and quiet. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is my most favorite Chinese restaurant ever excellent Excellent food great service nice staff"}
{"text":"Delicious food! First time guest. I ordered the low mein beef with an egg roll and fried rice. So much flavor and very very cheap! The staff was super friendly and attentive. I didn't wait more than five minutes to get my food and it was extremely hot. I sat at the booth and it was very clean and organized. I ordered off the lunch menu but the portion was huge! I wonder how large the regular sizes are. Very happy customer!"}
{"text":"Super fresh! Friendly service! Try the crab ragoons. Best I've had. Portions were decent. Overall it definitely deserved the Five stars!"}
{"text":"Great food, Great staff and totally authentic Chinese all the way. The kitchen staff works rhythm to their movements with the guy I believe to be the Chef and owner, calling orders to his Wife and assorted other relatives bantering in, Chinese?  I ordered the Dinner General Tso's  and it was very nicely spiced and delicious. You can't go wrong with a couple pork egg rolls dipped in the egg flower soup! Crab angels were crispy but soft, nicely done. The wife always has the Lo Mein, just the noodles and sauce only and as always the taste was excellent. Authentic, Tasty and Inexpensive!"}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese food, and Grace Garden is just down the street from me. After looking at their reviews I decided to give them a try. Very worth it! I ordered the Mongolian Beef, and it hit the spot! Reasonably priced and delicious!"}
{"text":"3.5 if I could. Good quality food from this Chinese kitchen with a large and ready to understand menu. Restaurant has very little seating and is geared toward takeout and delivery. Watch the chefs prepare your meal while you wait..."}
{"text":"Used to be better portions, guess the $10 hour minimum wage took it's toll here too."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 combinations for delivery and several add ons. All was served cold, unseasoned, and tasteless. Such a waste of $55. Frozen chinese food from a grocery store would have been better."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place.  Have it delivered once a week.  Always fresh and always fast!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!!! It's kind of misleading because it's tucked away in a strip mall. I discovered it while waiting on the movies at Fat Cats. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The family meal deal is an amazing value. Delivery is always on time. Always have left overs after the family is feed (bonus)."}
{"text":"wow we finally found a great chinese food for take out !
I thought the total bill was a bit high but we got 6 meals out of that order!!
excellent deal and the egg rolls are wonderful!"}
{"text":"My wife loves this place. Legit Chinese. We can both eat for $15 and take home leftovers. Everything here is good! 

The Christmas goose is excellent.  Could have done without the head. The entertainment was mediocre."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese food place in town! They have THE best fried won tons! I also always order the House Special Chow Mai Fun. So good! Great customer service, the owners & workers are always very friendly when I go in. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. We ordered three things all the time. Take out for the most part. 

The string beans are fresh and cooked perfectly. The beef that goes with it is always tender. The taste is altogether great. 

We also order hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"Super fresh food every time. Consistently delicious. Fast and friendly service. I love the Green Jade veggies!"}
{"text":"After going to a certain place for years, I was hesitant to try Grace Garden, but its my new favorite!!! My friend and I tried the Sesame Chicken and Chicken LoMein, soooo yummy! They deliver which I cant wait to try! They dont use MSG and the restaurant, although small, its super clean!"}
{"text":"Needed to have a quick dinner and the beautiful wife wanted to try a new Chinese place. Let's just say it was not all that good. 

Phoenix and dragon... Combo general tso's and spicy shrimp... Fried chicken parts with broccoli in watery sweet hot sauce with no flavor. Shrimp with ketchup sugar and red pepper flakes. Not good. 

Chicken with brown sauce... Fish fried chicken in sweet dark sauce with vegetables and peanuts. No flavor. Nothing redeeming. 

Beef with pea pods. Over salted and meat barely edible. Pea pods were ok.

Hot and sour soup was actually egg flour soup with vinegar and chili flakes added. The cornstarch was a noticeable ingredient. Not good. 

Ordered brown rice. Was not fully cooked dry and not edible. 

The front counter person was attentive and nice. So it was not a total loss, except for a waste of money."}
{"text":"We went there around 15 minutes before they close, we order to go and they were rushing us. The rice and Mongolian beef were good, but the chow mein its horrible, also ordered a lo mein and it was a waste of money flavorless, not good at all."}
{"text":"Wow...worst hot and sour soup I've ever eaten. Zero flavor. Tasted like warm toilet water. House fried rice was ok I guess as well as the egg roll. Certainly not worth the drive though. Next time I feel like Chinese I'll try a different place."}
{"text":"Simply amazing!  Just ordered delivery from this place and it's the best Chinese around!  We just moved to Gilbert and this was the first place that popped up to try.  The staff was friendly when we called in to order and the delivery man was also very friendly when he came to the door."}
{"text":"Eating here now, wonton soup is good. Kung pow chicken very good. Loved the egg roll. I would definitely come back! Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The food was original and had some flavor, but was not our cup of tea. My husband and I tried the broccoli beef, beef chow mein and orange chicken. $30 later we decided after sampling it all we should have saved our money and got Panda Express. Chicken was soggy not crispy and was just not worth the calories. We threw 1/2 the food away after forcing the food down for dinner."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Gilbert/Mesa and at great prices. They have authentic dishes found only at authentic places. The mei fun is awesome. You MUST try the fried dumplings for am old standard, which are the best I have ever had. Yummy."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  Ordered over the phone specified three times what I was getting to ensure the order was correct. Went to pick it up in a rush and it was $40 for one thing of chicken rice and one egg roll. I felt that was extremely expensive and had asked if it was normal for it to be that expensive for what I ordered and she said yes, got in the car and checked the ticket- they had given me 5 fried rices.  Went back in and they weren't happy that I had come back to let them know I only needed 1 fried rice to go with my 1 chicken and 1 egg roll. They refund the $25 of fried rice and I get home to open everything and have the order incorrect.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Tonight was suppose to be spaghetti however we decided to order out. My GF said there was this restaurant that had great Chinese food. So I looked it up read the reviews and decided why not. 

***BTW I am very picky and very much into my comfort zone of eating at new places.***

But!! We ordered the whole family dinner, it didn't take long to get here and the food was HOT!!!! 

I grabbed the low mein, orange chicken and some of everything else.

As I bit into the Orange Chicken I looked at my GF with surprise delight and said \"IT'S REAL CHICKEN\"!!!! 

yes, I went back to what Panda Express serves which is (orange chicken sponge) and this blew me away cause it was everything but that. It was great and fresh! 

In short I had two plates and I am satisfied and will be a returning customer. Everything was fresh and HOT! 

Thank you for a great dinner Grace Garden."}
{"text":"Excellent! Speedy, fresh and delicious! This is officially my Chinese takeout place. I try something different every time and it always good! I just ordered again and they are always polite. I recommend that you just go right down the list."}
{"text":"I like this place. I love that it is in the east valley and open late. I work second shift and it is rare to find an Asian Restaurant that is open so late. 
I have tried the crab rangoons, crispy noodles, fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, chicken with veggies, fried wontons. I am pretty picky about my Chinese food, and I really like this place. I wouldn't say love, although I do like it  a lot. No wedding any time soon, HA. 
The only criticism I have is that the sweet and sour sauce does leave a bit of an after taste. 
I have had delivery, and they are pretty quick and my order has always been correct. 
I hope this helps~"}
{"text":"Ordered on a Friday night, was delivered piping hot within 20 minutes! Food is delish, prices are great, very helpful employees... happy to answer questions and give suggestions. I ordered sweet and sour chicken and broccoli beef. It was great, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery (Egg Drop Soup. Pan Fried Dumplings. Egg Rolls and Pork Fried rice). Eaten on location (Orange Chicken. Seafood Platter). This is some of the best Chinese food I have had in this town. Between freshly made and being full of great flavors I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Large lunch portions and very affordable! We had chicken teriyaki and beef lo mein.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in Arizona. 
If you like real Chinese food.  Also always A grade on Health Department inspections."}
{"text":"I had a really negative experience today. It was my first visit and I went in for lunch. I ordered an egg roll and chicken lo mein. The egg roll was great aka normal. The chicken was SLIMY and smelled like FISH. It was terrible, I am not one to complain but it was really bad. One of my girlfriends had the same experience too, we could not eat the food. The owner came over and asked if I didn't like the food? (She seemed annoyed I didn't eat any of it) I apologized to her and said I am sorry no I don't like it. There was no offer to replace, or refund my money. She asked if I would like a to go box, I said sure thinking maybe a coworker would be willing to try it. She brought me a togo box with HAIR in it, long hairs stuck on the styrofoam. I was more grossed out than I was with the stinky slimy chicken. I will NEVER go bad, I do not recommend this place at all. Just gross."}
{"text":"Where to start? We live in an area that doesn't really have a choice for delivery and so we chose Grace Garden over China Pearl. BAD choice. 

To start, the girl that answered the phone was not very pleasant. She was impatient with me after I asked a couple of questions and definitely wanted to end the call asap. I ordered a Chicken with Mixed Vegetables, a Triple Delight, Crab Rangoons, Donuts, and chicken nuggets and fries for a little one. 

It took over 55 minutes for us to get our food. Upon opening the food I knew something was up. Nothing looked fresh, it smelled funky and it was...COLD. The nuggets were just microwave nuggets (I thought they'd be more like sweet and sour chicken nuggets without the sauce), the fries were soppy wet, the donuts were burnt AND soggy (I'm used to crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside), the chicken and mixed vegetables had horrible flavor and the vegetables tasted rotten. The Triple Delight was ok except for the beef which tasted grinded and then patted into a strip and I had gristle in mine. I literally could not finish my meal.  The crab rangoons were also mushy and not crunchy whatsoever. 

Honestly, I would not be surprised if the delivery kid got the order and then went to smoke a bowl or go to a friends house before delivering it to us. That or they just let our stuff sit under a hot lamp. I never thought you could really mess up Chinese food but this was proof that you actually can. That food was obviously made LONG before it ever made it to us. 

I would never recommend this place to anyone and I will never, EVER be returning as a customer. Terrible."}
{"text":"Great little gem in Gilbert.  Service was excellent.  Hot and sour soup was yummy.   I had sesame chicken with pork fried rice.   The rice was made with bean sprouts and had a good little crunch.   The sesame chicken was all white meat,  moist,  lightly breaded and the sauce was delicious.   My mom had the General Tso's chicken and it was the same.   They do sit down and to go service.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for Chinese cuisine. The food is so yummy. The service is always so quick and friendly. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out after finding it here on yelp! Amazing Chinese food! It's hard to find a good spot out here to get good quality Chinese food, but i think i have finally found my match! Their servings are more than enough, they definitely don't jip you on what you pay for and their prices are decent as well! We got the beef and broccoli and honey chicken and they both did not disappoint! So glad we found this place!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food place me and my fiancé have ever been to! We stumbled in here while waiting for our movie at fat cats! I highly suggest the chicken lo-mein and teriyaki chicken! Amazingly priced too. We ate it for the next two days it was such a huge portion and the meat wasn't fatty at all."}
{"text":"Rude service
Good was good
No restrooms for customers
Very small place

Before we where done with our food the lady came to our table and gave use not only our bill but the fortune cookies AND a to go container.  Not only where we NOT done but we didn't even ask for one.
We felt like she was saying...here, now get the hell out! 

I would have left a bigger tip if she didnt do that.

Will only return if i cant find a better chinese restaurant which we are having a hard time doing since moving to AZ."}
{"text":"We received a flyer on our door so we decided to give delivery a try. When we called they answered then hung up on us. So we called back to place our order. They took our order but seem to be aggravated that we were asking questions. They told us it would be 45 minutes for delivery. Close to an hour later they called us back to notify us that they were out of brown rice and substituted for white(which we were fine with and appreciated the call).she then told us that the driver would be at our house in 10 minutes. 15 minutes later we called back to see where our order was and the lady said we don't have brown rice. We again told her that was fine and wanted to know where our food was. She put us on hold and said he would arrive in 10 minutes.  We got our food 10 minutes later and the food was cold, rubbery and tasteless. No apologies were given."}
{"text":"I seriously crave the food from here! Everything I have had from here is great and the portion sizes are huge! I usually get 2-3 full meals out of each order. Things I've had: crab rangoon, egg rolls, fried dumplings, steamed dumplings, chicken wings, chicken on a stick, beef on a stick, chinese donuts, beef lo mein, chicken lo mein, sesame chicken, sweet and sour chicken, teriyaki chicken, white rice, brown rice, egg drop soup, wonton soup, crispy noodles for the soup. The restaurant is very clean and organized. The food is always ready very fast for pick-up and delivery is quick too. The food always arrives hot, even when it's pouring down rain outside and traffic sucks. I can't say enough good things about Grace Garden. We are moving away in a few weeks and I am sad that I will not be able to eat here anymore."}
{"text":"every once and a while i have a craving for chinese take out. today was one of those days. 
i ordered online because it was just too hot to drive today and they sent a confirmation email saying it will take about forty minutes. fine with me! 
an hour comes by and i decided to call just to make sure my order was delivered okay online. i was put on hold twice and then a they told me my order had just left the building. okay i wasnt to mad, everyone gets busy, i figured since they were busy it must be good food! 
and then another half hour came by and by now i had a screaming two year old saying hungry. the door bell finally rang and the delivery guy shoved my food in my face and counted my money to make sure i tiped him well.
i was already mad, then my food was cold, the cashew chicken that i ordered extra cashews was disturbingly gross and no extra cashews unless they only put five regularly. the sweet and sour chicken would have been okay but it was cold, and my two liter was hot. needless to say i will not be ordering from here again, ever."}
{"text":"Finally found a truly great Chinese place in East Mesa/Gilbert. The orange chicken is yummy. Chow fun is delicious. My favorite is the happy family with a Chinese brown gravy sauce. They deliver, take out or eat in the small space. Whatever you choose will be well worth it. Friendly employees and we've never had our order messed up or delayed. It's hot and ready 15 minutes after calling it in. If you've been looking for a great Chinese place like we were for a while, you must give Grace Garden a try!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered meals for the family they were all hot and tasty busy little place better do carryout than eat in seating is limited and usually a little to warm in there"}
{"text":"Very good food great service  lots of choices  and fast  I will be back loved it I went back  the next day was outstanding"}
{"text":"We are moving to the area so had dinner there last night. After each of us was served our meal the server brought a plate of what appeared to be fried donut like desert balls, I picked one up and put it back down, and another person in our party ate one. We legitimately thought it was complimentary.  A minute later another server came to our table and gruffly said \"this not yours!\" And carried it to the only other party in the the restaurant.  They CLEARLY saw that it was on our table and that we handled it. They sent it back of course- but they had to ask the server to take it back and give an explanation. The whole experience was so odd and so unsanitary. Ew. Too bad...because our food was pretty good but we can't trust that behavior, who knows what else they do???"}
{"text":"I love this place, it has the best food. It is the closest I have found to back east Chinese food."}
{"text":"First time here in the food was good and the service decentBut anything over $25 in  fast food Chinese is way too much I just have to keep on looking"}
{"text":"I've been to China Garden about a dozen times and the food has always been pretty good. The service, not so much. They are great for carry out. They offer delivery, but I haven't taken them up on that yet. 

Their lunch specials are great entree, rice, and soup or soda for either 4.75 or 4.95 (including shrimp options. The shrimp are large and always taste good). For me, I can make one lunch combo last for two days if I get two egg rolls to go with it. (They're large and taste pretty okay for 2.20. They aren't the best egg rolls but they are better than some of the other places around here.)

I'm not a spicy food person, and this place has been great for me and my stomach. However, I go with people who like spice and they haven't been disappointed either. The only thing I would recommend is that you stay away from the beef. It seems to be a bit slimmy to me, but everything has been yummy.

I had a bad experience once when I ate in (not the only time I ate in). They brought me my drink and soup and 20 minutes later they had to come out and ask what we ordered, cause they forgot about it or lost the order or something. That's about the only bad experience I've had with them.

The lo mein is good and the egg foo young is excellent."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome family deals ! So much food for the money! Highly recommend! Great location and friendly owners. The egg drop soup is great.  Take the time to order the family meal, you will have left overs !"}
{"text":"Foods inconsistent. Even was graced with hair in my food which they offered me a replacement for. It's expensive and you can't be sure if it's edible the next time you go. I won't be back
We went back and all got violently ill. Like when I ate Bernies food and that was at home. Never Again"}
{"text":"We have eaten at china garden many times today was horrible service. We waited 30 minutes for are meal then they brought me the wrong dish and insisted that's what I ordered. So I sat and waited for my daughter to eat her dish. The owner was there but avoided our table. So I left there hungry!!! I will never eat there again"}
{"text":"We have ordered here twice for delivery and it was really good both times! We got beef lo mein, pork fried rice, honey chicken, and beef and broccoli. All of it was really good, but the honey chicken and fried rice were stand out. The honey chicken was HOT and perfectly cooked. My kids shared an adult order and ate all of it between them. The fried rice had a lot of flavor and was probably the best fried rice I've ever had. This is definitely our new go to Chinese place. Super glad we found it!"}
{"text":"Was extremely please with my delivery the other night. Crab puff had actual crab in it, not just cheese. 
Potstickers were on point and had a nice side sauce to compliment it. Also ordered the orange chicken which was tasty and crisp. Not to soggy like most places chicken batter. A+ on my end"}
{"text":"This is our Chinese food restaurant.  By far, our favorite since moving out to the valley 10 years ago"}
{"text":"Amazing the best Chinese I've been to in Arizona I'm from Northern California and I'm shocked on how fresh the food was."}
{"text":"No. Just... no, to the food, the prices, and the service

Egg rolls: very oily. Bland
Wantons: pork inside had some flavouring that made them inedible.
Wanton soup: wet version of the fried wantons, also terrible
Vegetable lo mein: kind of ok, needs more vegetables. And should come with rice
Orange chicken: sort of ok, have had better from chain places sadly enough
Pork fried rice: barely ok, more veggies than pork

When we called to order and referenced their menu on their website for the dinner combo, they told us it was wrong, and only came with an egg roll and pork fried rice. I tried to explain it was right there on their website, they were really rude about it. 
$30 of food in the trash"}
{"text":"Kids and I really liked the food, service and prices!  Szechuan shrimp and shrimp with broccoli were super yummy, with large sized shrimp and perfectly cooked vegetables made for a really great meal. The egg drop soup was good too. Restaurant was clean and cheery. Staff were friendly and appreciated feedback. Small inside, just 4 or so booths and a couple tables and no customer restroom inside but the food and service were terrific!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn bad food. Most of it was cold. Wokee express is much better.  Not recommended.  BTW... bring your jacket,  cold as a meat locker in here."}
{"text":"Alright, so I'm trying this new thing where I review Chinese delivery places in my area based off of the same items on each menu. I'ma write a Yelp about it like to read it here it goes:

Overall Impression/TL;DR:  Grace Garden's food is quite nice. I've never been inside (only ordered via Grubhub) so I've never seen the interior of their restaurant, but I imagine it having cloth napkins and a nice ambience. Their food isn't sauced as heavily as *SOME* places (ahem, you KNOW who you are!), and I've never found their dishes to be overstarched or \"goopy\". I imagine that they probably use very fresh ingredients, and cut things daily (the green peppers, for example, are really exceptional, which is a weird thing to say but I stand by it!). Nothing tastes like it was sitting under a buffet heat lamp for 3 hours (again, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE!) but at the same time nothing really stands out very much. It's a great base-line restaurant from which to judge others, and it's definitely one of my favorite go-tos for delivery. So here's my breakdown of individual dishes:

1)  Eggroll:  Their eggrolls here are really good, possibly my favorite of any delivery place. They're never over-greasy, and they're fried just right so that there's a nice crunch followed by just a little bit of chew. A little light on the meat inside, but not so much that it really detracts from the experience. I like mines with hot mustard, and when you request hot mustard here they give you a dish with some amazingly potent stuff. Be warned- this isn't that stuff from packets, and it *will* send a tingle into your nose... but not in a bad way.

2)  Mongolian beef:  Really nice flavor in the meat, and a really good meat-onion-peppers ratio. My only complaint is that they don't (or didn't, in this order) serve it over those cripsy white saifun noodles, which a lot of people associate with \"Mongolian\" dishes, because that's a thing.

3)  Singapore mei fun:  Definitely not bad, but just a weeeeee bit on the blander side. I like much more curry flavor in mine, but this isn't the worst- it just isn't my favorite. Tastes... healthier, maybe? Maybe next time I'll request extra spicy when I order.

4)  Kung Pao chicken:  Not bad, but again, not my favorite. Tender pieces of breastmeat (I believe, I'm 93% sure it isn't thigh, which is my preference) with cubes of carrot, water chestnuts, celery, babycorn, and a very generous scoop of peanuts. All in all, it really isn't bad and is probably what 98.6% of all people expect when they order it, but I make my own at home and it's hard for anything to measure up. But this is probably what you like, so go ahead and order it you savage.

5)  Shrimp with black bean sauce:  Really quite nice! The shrimp are a *little* on the overcooked side, but they're definitely larger than what you might usually expect. The veggies are thick-cut and steamed perfectly, and the black bean sauce is very light. Probably my favorite dish out of all of the ones I tried tonight."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place and all the people who work there.  In the past year I have been too sick to cook or go buy food and having them deliver has been a God sent for me.  Everything I have ordered has always been wonderful.  These people really care about me and have been so kind. They just called and asked me if I needed anything including a ride to the doctors office.
Buy everything form them all the time, you will never be sorry ever....go no where else...they will treat you like pure gold and their food is made from their heart to yours!"}
{"text":"Food was good, although the service was better. We were greeted by a pleasant knowledgeable staff member immediately upon entering. The food was delivered to our table hot and with a smile."}
{"text":"Had the Szechwan Shrimp lunch combo. A good value at under $6 but it wasn't spicy or very flavorful and the veggies were overcooked a bit. Pork fried rice was good. Wanton soup just OK. 

Clean. Sriracha sauce on tables is nice. 

Nice that you can order from Grub Hub."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food. Polite service and prompt delivery. This is my go to Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"My brother and his fiance always order out here and have never actually stepped inside the joint, so when we as a group of 9 wanted to go out to eat in celebration of someone's birthday we had little idea how small it would be. However, the staff at Grace Garden, although a bit thrown off from the big group curve we threw at them, handled us... dare I say it... gracefully.

We ordered the Family Platter plus a couple of extra dishes. The Family platter says it feeds 6-7 people, but we definitely took home extras. It comes with a lot of different dishes, and I will probably miss a few.

Now, as you can see I am from NY, and I'm visiting my brother who lives in Arizona. This place says it's a NY-styled Chinese food joint. So, as your NY guide my verdict is... it passes! I'm glad my brother has a chinese place that can stand among our NY places. Some of my favorites were the kung-pao chicken, crab ragoon, orange chicken, and sweet and sour pork. The most incredible thing, for a group of 9, and ordering a few extras, the bill came out to less than $80. LESS THAN $80, for delicious food, to which there were leftovers.

I don't recommend this place for large groups, but dear Phoenix area, this is your place to go!"}
{"text":"My new Chinese delivery go-to.  I like that you can order online, and delivery is pretty fast.  The food is quite tasty and doesn't have that overly oily, fried residue that some Chinese food will leave behind.  My favorite dish is definitely the Chow Fun!"}
{"text":"Only Chinese place I go to when I'm missing my NYC take out. They are very friendly and delivery service is quick and quality. Good food, and great tasting."}
{"text":"Lo main mmmm! Food is very good and they deliver!! Crab puffs! Portions are decent they give good amount of meat in dishes but more is always welcome!! VERY FRIENDLY people there, it's more of take out place and that's alright with me! If your looking for a night in with Chinese food give them a call =)"}
{"text":"The best Chinese I have had in years, delivered even! And didn't wait long, 20 mins maybe. AWESOME service, friendly people! Awesome steak and green peppers!!! Also my egg roll was best I have ever eaten! Do not hesitate to eat here. I know I have a new favorite and will be back often."}
{"text":"Yum!  Loved the hot and sour soup and topped off with general tso chicken. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Ordered from them for the first time tonight. Girl on the phone was very pleasant and answered questions I had regarding vegetarian tofu options. Very patient and kind.
Food was delivered in a timely fashion. Hot and fresh. Good size portions for price. We had orange tofu with white rice for my vegetarian daughter. I had sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, and an egg roll. I really liked that the sweet and sour sauce was on the side. We thought the food was very good. We have enough for at least 2 more meals! Definitely will order from here again.
Excellent service and food."}
{"text":"Finally a great Chinese place close to home! Read the great reviews and since a menu arrived in the mail, we headed right over to check it out.  Lunch menu is huge, Hot and Sour soup satisfied my craving. Server was so friendly and the food came out in minutes.  Best Crab Rangoon I have had since moving here 6 years ago."}
{"text":"Wow every single item was delicious, the crab rangoon are really special, potsickers tasty, sweet and sour chicken very light not greasy at all, teriyaki chicken cooked to perfection, pork fried rice made with bbq pork which is hard to find and exactly the way I like it. Delivery wasn't on time-it was early-so everything was nice and hot. Definitely will order again!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times... it's usually ok-good. I ordered the shrimp chow mien and it was the worst I've ever had. Nothing but onions and only about 6 shrimp. Do not order it!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Food is delicious and prices are great for the portions! I love their fried rice and hot and sour soup. Quick dine-in, pick-up & even delivery! 

If you have young kids, you can probably get away with having 2 kids split the kids meal as it comes with quite a bit of food and a great variety!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, especially after the new owners came in. I'm glad they renamed it from China Garden to Grace's Garden because there is a difference with the quality of food and food handling. The old owners had family working in the back with no gloves and things weren't always clean. But for the last year or two, food is always piping hot when we order for pick up and the staff in the front are nice. Have had no problems with food because it's really, really good. I would give them 5 stars, but the place needs some cleaning and upgrading - there is so much potential of a 5 star! Will keep coming back though!"}
{"text":"I seldom would write a bad review about a little momnpop but I do not understand the big star reviews. We went last night and everything was basically inedible and my husband was sick all night. I wasn't sick because I couldn't eat my meal in the first place.  First we got 2 vegetable spring rolls, turned out to be frozen trash so burned and hard from the microwave we could not even break them open.  He got a shrimp dish with vegetables and brown rice. The brown sauce was odd and the rice was sour and obviously very old. I got sesame tofu and I have never had a worse dish served to me. It was a giant plate of probably 25 cubes of tofu fried hard as rocks and drenched in that sticky sweet red sauce with a couple of broccoli pieces on the side.  After trying to eat 2 pieces I could not eat any more.   The little boy who was doing his homework in the booth came and asked me if I wanted to take it home which I didn't. You might be wondering why I didn't complain but it is a teeny little family place and I didn't feel right starting about complaining thing. I guess I should have Probably the worst meal we ever had."}
{"text":"The chicken and curry with fried rice was so good!  It reminded me of the Chinese I had in Scotland. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I ordered last Saturday night, the food came quickly, and hot too! It is the best Cantonese style  Chinese I have had since  China China burned down years ago.  but the egg rolls and shrimp with lobster sauce are much much better. I haven't tried the egg foo young yet, but I am hopeful


ribs are yummy, egg drop soup pretty darn good. and the fried rice was heavenly, My 10 year old was so cute, woofing down a \"shrimp roll\" egg roll. she said I don't usually eat these, but this one is sooooo good!\" LOL  she said that about the chicken wings too. Thanks Grace Garden, I knew there had to be some good New York style Chinese food out there! I feel lucky I found you on Grub hub, because you are just around the corner from my kids \"Awesome\" school LOL Thanks Thanks and Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is the best!! I have several picky eaters in my family and they always get special requests right.  If the request was unclear, they call to clarify before they make it.  I am extremely picky about my chicken (no dark meat, fat or veins) and this is the only Chinese delivery that I don't have to look through it before I eat.  We have ordered many different items and it is always AMAZING!!  They are also quick, polite, and well priced."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today for the first time and enjoyed these two dishes;
41. Singapore Chow Mai Fun
75. Kung-Pao Chicken (w. peanuts)
#41's curry flavored noodles were a spicy delight. And #75 was above average -- possibly tied for the best in AZ. I try this dish at Every Chinese restaurant I go to, to give me a baseline of the restaurant's quality.

Good portions for a decent price ($5-$10). I'll be coming back again. 

Online ordering is a unique & possibly convenient option.

PS - Maybe it was a communication issue, but they seemed to be a little stingy with their rice -- wanting to charge extra for a second bowl, when almost all other Chinese restaurants have an all-you-can-eat policy (with the rice), when you order the dinner portion, and eat there. We did get a 2nd bowl for free... but I don't think it's their normal policy.

FYI - They use soybean cooking oil (not too bad if you have high cholesterol issues) IF REQUESTED and No MSG."}
{"text":"Best Chinese takeout in the area. Fresh, tasty, not too greasy, perfectly seasoned & cooked. First time here and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Sesame Chicken was hard.  No doubt it was frozen from Walmart.  Both it and the Szechuan Chicken we ordered came with broccoli (the NEW Chinese vegetable).  Why only broccoli and onions in Chinese food these days?  Nasty.  Anyway, the broccoli was not cooked at all.  Hard to chew, had to nuke mine and tossed the rest.  To be a good restaurant or better, you MUST cook your food people.  I've gone to this location for years, it's repeatedly changed owners and people.  Tired of wasting my money on sorry food.  Sad thing is, Maricopa County as a whole has some very bad restaurants.  I would say 90% serve overpriced and sorry prepared, if not frozen food.  I will cook at home and save LOTS OF MONEY.  I like that."}
