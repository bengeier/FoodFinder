{"text":"Western Pizza isn't my top choice for pizza. The delivery is almost always soggy and the sauce isn't very good, in my opinion. The cheese is okay but, the pepperoni is not very well done. I would say Western Pizza is just okay."}
{"text":"It's not often that you can find lasagna, fish and chips, fettuccine, pizza, dry ribs, jalapeno poppers, french fries, calamari and chicken wings, all at your local pizza joint. So when I saw all of the above, and then some, on Western Pizza Express' menu, I knew I had come to the right place. 

Serving a multitude of pizza flavours, as well as a multitude of food options, Western Pizza Express is DA BOMB. Their food is delicious, reasonably priced and made in record time. The staff is friendly and polite and chances are you may need to bring a friend to roll you out the door once you've finished your meal."}
{"text":"Terrible service, they told us the the driver was in an accident when he wasn't. They wouldn't own up to a mistake with the computer system. Everything would have been fine if they had just tried to right the order, instead they called me a liar and insinuated that I was trying to get free food. For the record, the pizza's terrible. Why would you try to get shitty pizza for free? The guy literally said to me on the phone \"do your worst, we don't care\", which certainly says a lot.

Please. Do yourself a solid and order from literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"this is the worst pizza i have ever eaten. the fam tried to turn back the clock and have pizza we hadn't had in almost five years. obvious change in ownership. stay away. head office needs to check up on this franchise."}
{"text":"Great pizza by the slice joint! I would suggest coming here dinner time or lunch time weekends- avoid the pre-teen school crowd like the plague

Cheap affordable tasty pizza. They also have the key sauces handy should you want to pimp up your slice- hot sauce, ranch sauce, etc"}
{"text":"Tired of cracker crust trendy pizza, this is not that!

Thick crust, toppings, sauces, ooooey gooey goodness 

Pizza you know will fill you up and have some for lunch tomorrow"}
{"text":"I haven't been in for the pizza-by-the-slice service people are talking about (though I may have to try it) but I did order from them recently, based on recommendations from another site, and don't get me wrong, it was good... but I think a lot of what I'm reading on here is a little over-stated.

They boast that they top their specialty pizzas with a special \"cheese blend\" and I'm not that big a cheese expert, but personally I didn't taste the difference there. They also brag on their menus about their own special recipe pizza sauce that kind of just tastes.... like pizza sauce. Now, I ordered a pizza to share with a friend who's VERY picky so we just got the specialty 'Lonely Pepperoni' so I can't speak to the rest of their toppings, but the Pepperoni was essencially the same thing you'd get in a grocery store, pre-sliced in a bag, so nothing special there either. The crust was alright, but it's pizza crust, there isn't a lot of room for innovation there. All in all the pizza tasted GOOD, but not worth writing home about by any means.

The wings were quite good - in fact, I dare say among the best I've had from delivery places, though the barbecue sauce wasn't my favorite. 

The issue I had that keeps me from wholly endorsing this place was the price. I got a 13\" one topping pizza and a very small order of wings for MORE than I normally pay for 2 14\" pizzas and 2L of coke at the big chain stores, and less food for more money is never a good deal.

To top this all off, the guy who answered the phone sounded kind of irritated (like I was somehow inconveniencing him by patronizing his business) and the delivery girl, while very nice, left our gate wide open when she left so the service was less than stellar as well.

All in all, it's a perfectly acceptable pizza option, but nothing that knocked my socks off, and not really worth the pricing in my PERSONALLY opinion, but hey... to each their own, I suppose.

One other minor gripe.... seriously, who cuts pizza in squares? lol"}
{"text":"This isn't the best pizza you'll ever have, but as far as affordable non-domino's type fake cheese crap pizza goes, this is a winner. Staff is friendly too!"}
{"text":"Can you write your hours of operation somewhere??? I want to pick up a pizza for my sons lunch today and they are not posted anywhere. I even tried to phone thinking it maybe on the answering machine message but no! Come on... why the secret???"}
{"text":"Ah, pizza.  Everyone loves a good slice, and everyone especially loves a good slice for a good price.  Hey, that rhymed.

Western Pizza makes really delicious pizza and doesn't charge an arm and a leg for it.  You can be full of good pizza for under $5.  What's better than that are the different toppings you can get on your pizza.  Instead of having the basic pepperoni, veggie and meat lovers, they actually have a plethora to choose from.

What's even better than that is that they deliver.  Or, if you don't live that close, they have take-out so you can take home a whole pizza from this place.

You can't miss this place.  It's just off Elbow Drive after you pass Heritage.  Look for it and be satisfied by the pizza you're eating."}
