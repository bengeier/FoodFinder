{"text":"Again, not the greatest looking place on the outside, not too great on the inside either, needs some major updating, but a fun place to party and unwind with a few games of pool.  The food is hot, beer is cold and the owner Harold is very nice!  Good prices and they have a DJ on Saturday Nights."}
{"text":"The place is a dump. The owner is rude and has actually chased customers away because of her horrible attitude! 
The food ( if that's what you wanna call it) is greasy n gross. Even the drinks were watered down. 
I Definatly DONT recommend this place...ever!"}
{"text":"I felt like a total outsider coming in here for our dart league. Once there I changed my mind. 

The staff was great, the food was good and the patrons were all cool. 

I had the catfish, fries and slaw. It may have been the best slas I have ever had. It had a fresh and flavorful taste. The fish and fries were good too. 

My only negative was the $4 captain and sprite....way too small of a glass and pretty weak pour. If you like liquor and beer...stick to the beer. They had a killer deal on Blue Moon."}
