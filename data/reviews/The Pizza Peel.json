{"text":"Good pizza, good atmosphere and an amazing draft selection. $3 nc drafts on Thursdays cannot be missed."}
{"text":"I love the Plaza Midwood location, the homemade chips, and the philly cheesesteak. The beer options are also good. The pizza is only OK, however. The waitstaff is friendly, but the restaurant has several times been disappointingly stingy with toppings, in my opinion (and I am not a fan of over-dressed pizzas). Basically, when I go, I don't get pizza. If you are in the area, definitely try it to see what you think, but there's better pizza elsewhere. Families seem to enjoy the outdoor patio, so if you have kids, this may be reason enough to visit."}
{"text":"I recently moved close to the pizza peel and was excited to check it out after reading the reviews on yelp.  The pizza I ordered was pretty good and they have a reasonably priced beer selection.  They could however update their beer list as my friend and I struck out twice on our first two selections because their list was old.

The worst part of our visit were the regulars who seemed to flock there for trivia night.  (I think it was a Wednesday)  I would like to give this place another shot but I think I will choose a different day of the week."}
{"text":"Ordered a \"build your own\" pizza tonight. The kitchen must have been running out of toppings as my pizza came out with hardly any cheese and only a few small pieces of chicken. My pizza was mostly crust (see photo), so it's hard to say whether or not it was any good. Our sever (Katie H) was pretty terrible and unapologetic about my bare pizza. 

We've eaten here several times, but after this experience, it will be a while before we're back."}
{"text":"I have only been once but we had a great time! The food is very good and they have a very nice beer selection on tap! They even have a Wii you can play! How cool is that? I would recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"Very much disappointed in todays lunch..  I should have known better than to order a sandwich in a pizza shop.  I ordered the Philly Steak and fries were not an option.  They plate it with a mountain of chips I did not care for...  Really bland !  It was almost as if I ordered a plate of chips with a side sandwich.. The sandwich was rather small and not flavorful at all...

It is a pretty cool little local spot tho...  Very clean and seemingly well ran. My server Anna was more than helpful.. And cute !

After I order I noticed a little area that looked like a pizza buffet so I asked Anna and she confirmed it was available Monday thru Saturday.  So I think if I give them another shot I will try the buffet to check out their pizza...  Also I saw a family order some wings that looked really good...

Still disappointed with my order tho after reading these reviews..."}
{"text":"Pizza peel is AWESOME! They have a ton of tasty options. My friend and I stopped in at the end of the night on a Friday and were VERY excited to discover ALL pizzas after 12:00 were only $5!!! How did I never know about this!? We had the Tongs Thai and Buffalo Chicken... Both scored a 10! Our service was great as well, Scott and Michael were helpful in our pizza selection and were very friendly! Would highly recommend this to be everyone in Plazas last stop of the night."}
{"text":"Come for the pizza, stay for the beer.  Pizza Peel is that neighboorhood pizza place where somebody inevitably knows your name.  It's small, but it somehow manages to accomodate sports fans (at least 3 big TVs to watch the games), families with kids, the post-work crowd who loves trivia, and those who are just generally hungry for good food and drink.  When the place gets packed, it feels like the small building might split its seams, and you better not be claustrophobic, but outside of a weekend night, it feels homey and cozy.  The offerings are diverse and ecclectic, with both Thai pizza and fish tacos sharing the same menu, but everything you'll try is tasty, and the prices are reasonable.  Their beer list is unmatched in quantity and variety, with about 30-40 beers on tap, and many more in bottles.  Friendly staff, fast service, high-quality ingredients, unique flavors, and another round of alcohol - what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Great interior, great beer and great food! We had the Tong's Thai pizza which was awesome.

I can't wait to go back to try some of the more traditional pizzas. I think it may be my new favorite pizza place in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this shop a couple times now and have been pleased with the food every time. I think what sets The Pizza Peel ahead of it's competition is the crust. It's not too thick and cooked well enough that it doesn't get all soggy to where the toppings slide off. The crust also has a very nice wheat/ground corn meal flavor.

They have a decent beer selection. Nothing as extensive as Mellow Mushroom or Revolution. Also, I don't believe they do mixed drinks either. Anyway, we're here for the pizza, right?

The inside is a little cramped. Well the hole place isn't really very spacious. They do have a small lawn outside with a disc gold net often swarmed with children in the day time.

I would definitely recommend The Pizza Peel if you're looking for some great tasting pizza in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We ordered a large BBQ Chicken pizza to go.  There was very little cheese and almost no chicken on the pizza.  One of the worst pizza I've had in years"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food is delightful.

They have tons of beer, good, local beer too.

Great place for a large gathering."}
{"text":"My sister  and  I gave this  place a try, because  a co-worker  told  me  that  they  had  great  pizza. I  paid  almost thirty dollars  for  a  large pizza. It was one of  the  worst pizzas I  ever had. The toppings were skimpy, no sauce , dry. I  don't  know  if  I  will  frequent this  place  again . Maybe another  location ."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Food was good,  but I don't know that I would go out of my way for it. It's in our neighborhood,  so we end up there often."}
{"text":"This place seemed really empty for a Saturday night in the heart of Plaza Midwood.  That should have been by first clue, but considering myself lucky we went in for some beers and a pizza.  The pros here are on tap.  Many fine local beers to choose from and surely you can find one (or many) that you like.  I was really hopeful for good pizza too, it's in the name.  It wasn't anything special and I've had boxed pizza's from the frozen food aisle that have more flavor.  The group I was with wasn't impressed either.  Maybe if the name of the food is in your name it should be the shining star.  I'm not brave enough to try another menu item if your main dish can't reel me in.  Service was just alright, not bad, but not great.  Nothing overly special here, now I understand how I got in and out so easily on a Saturday Night.  Good luck Pizza Peel."}
{"text":"Pizza Peel is everything I've come to expect from a pizzeria. Good pizza, nice beer, and a cheerful staff. But, what I wasn't expecting was that house salad. I don't think I've ever been so happy eating raw vegetables before! If I wasn't a sound minded man I would think Gandalf the Grey himself had a hand in making such a wonder side item. The cherry on top was that ranch dressing. so good! It's no Hidden Valley but, defiantly the best on this side of Thomas St."}
{"text":"Great place for a beer.  Cool atmosphere, friendly people, attentive staff. No complaints, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Personally, I feel that of any restaurant type that Charlotte doesn't need any more of, it's brick oven pizza.  

For that reason, I wanted to dislike Pizza Peel.  But no such luck.

3 of the 4 stars I've given this place are due to the fantastic, absolutely fantastic beer selection for such a small place.  From IPA to Barley Wine, Framboise to Stout, their beer list is impeccable.  Everyone who claims to like hops needs to drink Bell's Two Hearted Ale at least once.

The pizza is good.  And the service is friendly.  Certainly my favorite eat-in pizza joint in Charlotte.  

I did penalize them 1 star for adding to the already saturated list of Charlotte pizza joints.  But again, this place is really good."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. There pizza was lookin like it was cooked by  bunch of brains. I mean, it was crippled. And the service, was a whole different level of crap. The bear selection was smaller then my grandmas cel let door. The one good thing was that restaurant was half nice. Sorry about the review, but I was very disapointed"}
{"text":"My hubby grew up in NJ, so NYC was just a short jaunt away when the craving for great pizza would hit. We have lived all over the states and have tried many pizza joints. And what do you know, after 12 years with this man he finally found a pizza place that tastes like home. We ended up making our own pizza and it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. It started with the original crust, added a chipotle sauce as our base some mozzarella, pepperoni, onions, minced garlic and get this... Chorizo!!! Chorizo on pizza?! I'm in love. I also loved the fact that I could order a flight of craft beer. Which was an excellent way to sample at least five brews and all with a decent amount in each glass. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good slice of pizza but I must say this place is a high contender! I had a delish made to order pizza with more toppings than I have ever gotten (branching out!) and had a bit of thai-type pizza. Yummy! I am not a beer drinker but all the guys seemed happy with the wide selection. Plus, the game was on--I think this made them happy too!

Anyway, this place is worth giving a go. Other highlights:

Small
Good specials
Old School games (Pac Man, anyone?)
So so atmosphere
Outdoor seating
Friendly and efficient staff"}
{"text":"Wow another horrible pizza place on central - I thought fuel was mediocre so when pizza peel came I thought finally a good pizza place but their pizza is even worse. Someone told me their wings were good which I didn't try but shouldn't their pizza be good - I hate wasting money (and calories)"}
{"text":"Customer service is sub par and leaves a lot to be desired. We get take out from here often but tonight we decided to go in for a quick meal. We asked if there was a wait ahead of time and were sat. We were a party of 2 plus a baby. After we had finally settled with all of our baby's things and as I'm about to spoon food into my hungry baby's mouth, we were asked to move tables because they made a mistake and wanted the table for a bigger party. A) you already sat us. B) you don't ask a mother feeding a hungry child to move because you made a mistake C) you certainly don't walk away and leave us to carry the high chair in addition to all our things as the hostess just watches us struggle D) we were 3 people at a 4 top!! You need to work on customer service and common sense."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere, love coming here for laughs, music, etc!!

Mondays is beer poker night and live music is on Thursdays. The staff are all great and come to know you as a regular quickly. 

My favorite place to eat in Cotswold and now the have a plaza midwood  location too!"}
{"text":"Arrived on 7:30 on Labor Day  and grabbed a seat on a table  beside the grassy area outside. 

N.C brews were $3. 
Regular price of bottled Budweiser, Bud Light, Miller, etc is $3.25.  

I ordered the 8in Buffalo Pizza. 
Pretty good! 
Server was nice. Ambience was great. It was about 75 degrees, and the locals next to us at the table were very informative regarding local spots nearby. 

... Stayed for addtl drinks and hung out long after we were done eating. 

Nice spot.  Especially cool outside atmosphere when  the weather is agreeable. I will definitely be returning to try addtl me but menu items."}
{"text":"Great food. Good beer selection. Awesome place to go with large groups. Very kid and pet friendly. It's a win-win for groups of parents. We're thrilled to have Pizza Peel in the 'hood!"}
{"text":"Hands down BEST BLACK BEAN BURGER in Charlotte!!!  But this is a pizza joint, right?  Yes, you heard me--best black bean burger.  Our 8 year old little girl says \"it's so dreamy!\"  and I agree.  It's got great texture and flavor.  It's on the specials menu and hopefully it will be on the regular menu all the time.  The fish tacos with black beans and rice are tasty, too.  Of course, the pizza is really good, too.

The Peel is our regular Friday night spot with our 2 girls.  Great atmosphere, family/kid friendly, great beer selection, great service.  Just can't say enough good stuff about the place!"}
{"text":"The waitress confidently suggested I get the Tongs Tai pizza and it was great! Family friendly with outdoor seating and fun."}
{"text":"Extremely impressive beer selection on tap and the bartenders are not greedy about letting you have a couple tastes before making your selection.  The pizza was excellent and service was speedy.  We ordered a specialty pizza called \"One Veggie\" - Red Sauce, Mozzarella, Roasted Garlic, Mushrooms, Goat Cheese, Artichokes, Pesto.  I would highly recommend it to anyone!  Besides the specialty pizza selections you can also create your own and they offer 8\" and 16\" sizes.  

Also, good news to people with small children, this place is incredibly family friendly!  Along with the impressive beer selection, they also had an impressive selection of flavored milk!!  It seemed like more milk was being served than beer when we were there.  

If you are not looking for a kid friendly environment, just show up later around 7:30 or 8pm.  I think we arrived at family happy hour (around 6:30), but all the children started to disappear around 7:30...bedtime! :)

So I would highly recommend for pizza and beer lovers with children or without children!  Just pay attention to what time you decide to show up!"}
{"text":"Everyone knows this was the old Mellow Mushroom which now is totally gone from the Charlotte market.  Food was good, beer selection amazing.  I have to commend them on the renovation.  It does not feel like an old Mellow Mushroom... not sure it feels like a pizza joint, but hey it is kinda cool.
The bartenders are into their beer and you really should go in for this reason.  Do not look at the beer list.... you will miss the experience.  Ask the bartenders... sample, play and enjoy.  Watch out for some of those Gravity Beers.  They will knock you right off your bar stool"}
{"text":"This place must be a locals thing.  I went for the lunch buffet today.  Meh... A spread of 4 pizzas do not a good buffet make.  Food was OK, however nothing incredible enough to have been shown as one of the best lunches in CLT. Strangest tasting blue cheese salad dressing I've ever experienced. 

Maybe it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"We have been getting carry-out from Pizza Peel for several months and LOVE their Greek salad. Tonight, we dined in so we could listen to the live music. Our pizza was not quite up to par, but our waiter, Tony, took care of us. The chef came to our table and hand-delivered our new pizza, which was delicious. Many restaurants would have let us walk away dissatisfied, but the amazing service at Pizza Peel caused us to leave with completely satisfied and with a smile."}
{"text":"We had just returned from hiking Crowder Mtn. & we were famished. Decided to try Pizza Peel which we had heard good things about. An inviting & cozy atmosphere. The live Blue Grass music was welcome, but so loud you had to yell to have a conversation at your table. We were pleased to find the pizza crust to be whole wheat, kind of crunchy...very good. The generous toppings were fresh and tasty. The beer selection was excellent and from local breweries. We really liked this place and will be back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great and can't beat the craft beers on tap.  Pizza was solid but the only negative was the service we had sitting at the bar.  Bartenders were more focused on socializing with their friends and flirting than serving drinks, making sure our food came out as ordered (it didn't), and well just doing their job.  Have a lot of friends in the industry and this was the first time in years I haven't tipped 20%."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting a Pizza and Peel. Atmosphere was great, the weather was awesome and it was a kid friendly because the kids could play with the dogs, frisbee golf, and corn hole games. Prices were good but the waiter was kind of a douche. But, the pizza was just ok. They used a wheat crust and were missing out on some flavor. 

We order the chips, garlic knots, pepperoni pizza and meat lovers pizza. Like I said, they all lacked good flavor. 

Definitely won't be going back considering the number of other great places right down the street."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza & \"knots.\"  Crust was thin on bottom, but thick around the edges.  Whole wheat pizza was an extra treat.  Service was good, atmosphere was cozy, quite for lunch."}
{"text":"Great service and prices and wonderful atmosphere. During lunch my friend and I were one of the only seven people there, so it wasn't too busy. It took way too long for one pizza, and when it got over it was lukewarm and the bottom completely black. I couldn't even taste my toppings. Its an hour later and I still have the charcoal taste in my mouth. Wish I had a better experience!"}
{"text":"The server (who was also the bartender) was great, which is why I am giving 2 stars instead of 1. I ordered a salad that was supposed to come with dried cranberries, but there were none on it. I asked the server if it was supposed to have cranberries on it and she said it was, so she got some from the kitchen. I ordered the one veggie pizza, which I have gotten every time I've been there because it's usually really tasty. It was completely soggy except for the crust, and it disintegrated when I tried to pick it up to eat it. It also did not have a good flavor and was very bland. I ate 3/4 a piece and couldn't stomach the rest. I told the server it was too soggy and just not good at all. She had the cook make me another one and boxed it up for me. It looked better, but when I got home, (sorry to be graphic), I had the worst case of the runs and still have not recovered (over an hour later)! Definitely not going to eat the pizza they made for me to take home! Ugh! What a disappointment! I'm wondering what the sanitation grade is there."}
{"text":"Ordered buffalo wings ($7.99) and a cheese pizza ($15.50). 

Cheese pizza was saltier than I would have liked it so for a pizza place I give it a MEH review. 

The real winner was the wings. OMG. Can NOT wait to go back and try their other flavors. 

Worker was nice and we sat out on the patio."}
{"text":"BBQ chicken pizza was great! Different - the sauce was very unique. The crust was a great mix of a little chewy and soft with a little crunch in the peel. We did take out so I can't comment on the service. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Lots of beers to choose from at this place.  This is a local watering hole.  Food is good too.  Can be busy and parking is an issue, but none of this things has stopped me from eating and drinking at this local place."}
{"text":"Good happy hour(3-6pm) appetizer options - they're half off. Our pizza was good. Service was great. Great spot for family, group of friends or a to chill out. The crowd and the menu is easy and inviting. We will return."}
{"text":"Good pizza , good beer, good staff! I would highly recommend the buffalo pizza with celery!  Bloody Marys are good too lol. Asked for it spicy and the man made it spicy !  meatball sub is really good and earthy tasting ! Got a disk golf pin and I believe corn hole outside on the green turf so that's cool but I like the inside better. Watch out for parking because on a Thursday, Friday, and Saturday and hell even Sunday its a bitchhhhhhhh to find parking . so park at the CVS and watch meter maid! Orrrrr park at the wells Fargo or find parking near the whiskey house lol."}
{"text":"The food was okay but I will definitely not be back solely based on the service. We sat for a good 10-15 minutes before a server even bothered to come over to us. From then on it was like pulling teeth trying to get further service from our waiter. Pretty awful."}
{"text":"The beer selection is staggering and their pizza is some of the best I've found in Charlotte. When ordering an appetizer go with the chicken curry spring rolls they will blow your mind!"}
{"text":"What's happened to this place the food is the same the service is just gone down hill. It takes for ever to wait for a table to be cleaned . As you watch people just stand around. We would go there a couple months ago and let our children play in the yard, last time I was afraid to let them run loose. Not sure what the changes are but if it was my place everybody would be required to leave their phones in the car because that's what half the staff is doing either texting. talking or playing on their phone...."}
{"text":"I fell in love with the PP during my 1st official Yelp Elite event-- and have gone back twice since!  

The environment is really homey, dark wood everywhere, casual and family friendly.  

But what really got me, was the yummy pizzas with plenty of creative toppings and nice wheat-ish chewy, tender crust on the inside and crisp, crunchy outside. 

An 8 inch pizza BBQ or Thai pizza at PP is $8.  Over at California Pizza Kitchen, their pizza is 10 inches and is about $11-$14.  The similar 10 inch specialties at Mellow Mushroom are about $11- $13. (Some are cheaper, like the plain cheese.) Honestly, for the price-- I don't miss the additional 2 inches of pizzas!  PP $16 larges are also about $3 or $4 less than the MM large 16 inchers. 

Oh, and the BBQ ribs appetizer was tasty-- for $5 you get 3 big ribs that are dry rubbed, baked then fried and drenched in a savory/sweet BBQ sauce.  

Can't wait to try the pizza lunch buffet for $7.50 with pizza and salad included! 

PS:  Oh yeah, and the magician, Magic Barry who makes an appearance on certain nights, he is a blast in a glass.  Like a more wholesome, senior citizen version of David Blaine :-)"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great beer selection, overall great place. They don't seem to handle volume really well, so when they are busy be prepared for a little lag in your food and service. The staff is friendly, though, and they'll help out if something is wrong. 
Specialty pizzas are always a hit, and their \"secret\" menu offers great ideas for pizzas when you're stumped on choosing toppings. 
They cook late night on Fridays and Saturdays, which makes a great alternative to the same old late night pizza options in the neighborhood. 
The beer selection is great, offering several craft beers on tap. The selection rotates, and they offer half pints and flights for people who want to try out a few beers in one visit. I also noticed they have a decent bottled beer selection, offering such gems as Brooklyn Black Ops. Not too shabby. 
Overall, great spot. Can't give it five stars because of the service and food getting mixed up occasionally when it's busy, but I'll keep going back."}
{"text":"Good place for pizza...try the Aguascalientes pizza. It's the best at this place. Good spot to hangout with your friends. Bicycle friendly place too."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Seriously, the pizza is amazing. The selection of beer is vast and the staff is nice. I love coming here for lunch."}
{"text":"Pros - the pizza is decent.

Cons - the pain you go through to get it does not make it worth it. We have been here twice now and the full experience (i.e. wait time & customer service) has turned us away from this place. We live in PM, and there are too many other places nearby (from MP and Noda) to get good pizza from and have a better experience. 

Our first visit was when this place opened. There was a mix-up with what we ordered and what we received - something to do with Prosciutto, and Bruschetta. But the manager made it right by throwing in the other half of the pie. It just took a really long time (about an hour) to get what we ordered.

The next time was about a month ago. Got a small pizza to go. Took a little over an hour to get the pizza. Most of the other people at our table had gotten their orders and were paying their bills as we waited for our to go order. The service was lousy as well and we finally had to get up and talk to a manager. The manager went to the food window and got our order - seems it had been there for a bit (back to the lousy service). All he offered was - \"we're busy.\" No apology or offer to smooth it over."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots in Charlotte! Have been going regularly since it opened.

Ask for the secret chef's menu. Our favorite is the Samoan, has chorizo, pepperoni, onion, and a spicy sauce.

Also love the bruschetta and fish tacos. And great beer selection!

Stopped in Saturday night for pizza after the football game. Thanks to the staff for accommodating us and letting us watch the end!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, and it has always been a good experience. They have a nice but not overwhelming selection of craft beer, including many local brews, and great pizza options! I can vouch for the Sorry for Partying (though it's too much meat for me so we usually get it without the pepperoni and ground beef), Roasted Veggie, Black Bean, Greek, Tong's Thai, and Aguascalientes (perhaps my favorite)! [Told you we've been several times.] Garlic knots are tasty if you're starving!

They also do a great job with the salads - they're huge and great for splitting before the pizza comes! If you're splitting one, they'll often go ahead and put it in two bowls for you - I'm convinced it turns out even bigger that way. Great way to fill up so you don't eat all the pizza and can come home with leftovers!

It's crowded on Friday evenings, but with a party of two you don't usually have to wait very long. The bar is also crowded, though, so can take a minute to get a beer while you wait for your food. Staff is easy-going and friendly. Might be better for groups on a weeknight."}
{"text":"We ordered from Uber eats and chose this location. I guess with the name \"pizza peel\" all they're good for is pizza. We ordered 3 pastas and they were all flavorless and tasted more like noodles than sauce. I guess now we will not trust the restaurants on Uber eats. Lol"}
{"text":"Pizza Peel & Tap Room is right around the corner from our house so naturally we had to hit them up. They weren't memorable enough to make it to our favorites list but they were good enough for a good night out. I got the chorizo pizza with prosciutto and whole roasted garlic and Ella got the turkey cobb salad. The chorizo pizza was good but not great and the cobb salad was... well... a cobb salad. We didn't really find anything memorable about the Pizza Peel but it might have just been an off night. The location is 5 minutes from our house so I'm guessing its pretty likely we will hit them up again."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and outside seating. Ask for the secret menu. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere and laid back place. Good craft beer on tap and the service was great. Manager checked up on us and was very helpful."}
{"text":"My hubby discovered this little gem and since he and my son are pizza freaks we decided to give this place a try.  It's nice and clean and very appealing, it seems, to the residents in the neighborhood. Lots of families and tables filled with people drinking, laughing and eating together while the children played in the open \"grass\" area with balls and Frisbees. I suppose if you wanted to go to a quiet dinner, sitting outside is probably not your best option. It was much quieter inside but we sat outdoors, I have wee ones.  The waitress was very attentive and answered my questions and when she wasn't sure of something, she went inside and asked. Loved this because some just say, \"I'm not sure.\" and then stand there and look at you.  We ordered a 16' red sauce and cheese pizza, and 8' heart attack pizza, a philly cheesesteak and 8 wings (4 buffalo and 4 inferno).

Cheese Pizza:  Thin Crust, nice chew and a little crisp. Son and daughter liked it.

Heart Attack Pizza:  Meats were flavorful, hubby devoured it, I gave it a taste and it was good but not mind blowing. Needs a tad more seasoning but definitely not disappointing.

Wings:  Oh, the wings!  I was literally humming and doing the happy dance.  They were crispy and spicy and soooo yummy!  I loved them. They were also the a nice size, not those tiny little wings. These were meaty and filling and worth the $1.00+/piece.  Couldn't tell the difference by sight between the buffalo and inferno (made with habanero) but after tasting them you could tell one had more heat. Hubby took one bite and couldn't handle them.  I have a high heat tolerance!

Cheesesteak sandwich with homemade chips and dipping sauce:  Very nice.  My daughter had provolone, lettuce, tomato and raw onion which they put on the side.  The waitress seemed perplexed that she would want raw onions. LOL! Guess that's not a thing here. I had a couple of bites and it was very good. Lots of meat and a good portion.  I was surprised they didn't serve fries but the homemade chips were really delicious and I love the ranch dipping sauce. My daughter had to keep smacking my hand away.

I took away one star because my daughter had to ask two different people for ketchup and her food got a little cold while she waited. And the fact that they don't serve French fries, just sweet potato fries.  Their chips are yummy though.  

I will definitely be back and will try new things but I will certainly get the wings and some of those yummy, seasoned, homemade chips!!  Hope this was helpful! Now, go and eat!  That is all."}
{"text":"Our pizza WAS Amazing. This was our first time here and we will come here again when we are craving pizza.  My got the southwest salad which was very good as well. Can't wait to come here again."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Tongs thai is great and the lunch buffet is great for stuffing your face.  The beer and weekend crowd is always top notch!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time this past Sunday because we were craving pizza.....plus, we used to take our car to the mechanic that was in this exact location, which we thought was cool!

Nice atmosphere inside. We sat down and ordered 2 beers--Shotgun Betty for me and NODA Imperial Gordgeous for my husband.....I didn't even see the Imperial Gordgeous on the menu, so of course, I had to get a second beer to get it. So amazingly delicious and smooth. Man I love that beer. Makes me want Fall to be here! Anyways, I digress. There beer list is very good. Lots of local craft options. Also, I thought it was neat that they had a section suggesting beers, if you didn't know what to order!

We ordered the garlic knots as an appetizer becaues we were so hungry. Honestly, we could have definitely done without these. They were just ok and not as garlicly as we were hoping. 

For the pizza, we ordered the supreme pizza (i have no clue what they called it but basically had a few types of meats and a few types of veggies). There are only 2 sizes, basically an indiviudal pizza and a large pizza. We ordred the large and, of course, took home leftovers. The pizza was very good. I felt like everything was just incredibly fresh!

Definitely will be returning because of the atmosphere, beer, and pizza!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that is too big for its own boots. It is no secret that this place is good. Often during dinner service there is a wait to get in here. The quality is there. The seating is European style. Meaning you could be at a table close to someone else. [I like this style, it makes some uncomfortable but get over it] The food is good. The only thing I've been slightly annoyed with the service, is that at lunch time they have a pizza buffet, which the server never mentioned to my group. The buffet is cheaper than a single pizza. 

CONS: 
The bar area really isn't defined. There can be issues if you are sitting near the bar and people try to participate in the bar at a second level deep. This is more of a staff deal [which should stop that]

Given that, I would go back here. The food is good, the combinations of the pizzas are unique. 

[ BTW This place is owned by the same group that owns Flying Biscuit and Monkey Joes in charlotte]"}
{"text":"Such a fun location in the heart of Plaza Midwood. Great outdoor area with frisbee golf and cornhole. Inside, there was a one mad band playing 90s music. Loved the intimate experience listening to music, drinking beer great Pinot Noir and eating delicious pizza! The best part is that you can pick two specialty pizzas to have within the personal 8\" pie. I tried the Updyke and Thai. Highly recommend the Updyke :)"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout, so can't speak about the restaurant experience. I liked their One Veggie pizza. I wasn't a fan though of the pools of oil that collected in the crust as I ate it. Garlic knots were just okay. I probably wouldn't order them again."}
{"text":"The staff is always courteous and they have a nice beer selection. I don't have a goto here but haven't been disappointed by anything either."}
{"text":"Service was great! Bartender and manager very helpful with beer selection. Really nice vibe in the place . Very comfortable. 
                 The pizza was good. The dough was a little sweet for me. But it had a good amount of pepperoni,so that was good ."}
{"text":"I was excited for Pizza Peel to open in our neighborhood. It looks great inside and out, they did a really good job of making it comfortable, modern, etc. I've been to the original Pizza Peel a few times and really liked it so I was excited to have one in my neighborhood.

The place looks great, good service and pizza was good. Unfortunately, unlike the original, they do not have any good lunch deals and after spending $30 for two people on pizza and a side salad, they charged $1 for sides of ranch. I like Pizza Peel and happy they are in our neighborhood but rather than a great place to grab a pizza and beer, they are treating it like a high end restaurant and nickel and diming their local customers. 

I would go again but just for a pitcher. Otherwise, back to Fuel Pizza!"}
{"text":"This pizza here was fantastic and they had a lot of great local brews on tap that I've never tried before. Atmosphere was rockin and staff was very cool. I'll definitely be coming back here my next visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Poor Service.

I liked the pizza and wanted to love this place, but poor service makes it a place that I don't plan on returning to.

After being seated at our table it took around 5 minutes to hear from a server. Slow in delivering our drinks to us. 45 minutes after we ordered our pizzas we looked around and realized that 3 or 4 tables that came in well after us were already eating pizza. It took a few minutes to flag our server down and it was clear that he had not been checking on our order. Bottom line, our pizzas were not even being made. He apologized and offered us chips will we waited. Tables that came in after us had finished their meal and had left before we even received our pizzas. 

Pizza Peel gave me no reason to be a return customer. Plenty of other places in the neighborhood to dine."}
{"text":"The pizza here is great and the atmosphere is relaxing. The staff here is also amazing. Our host literally found my keys and made sure they got back to me. The host even flagged down our car as we were leaving to bring us our pizza. Phenomenal service."}
{"text":"Went here for the last time this weekend.  Food was decent to good, but service was just plain bad.  Waitress was rude and slow.  This place would be an easy 3-4 stars based on their food, but we had slow and rude servers twice in a row.  Gave them a second chance and they blew it!"}
{"text":"Go for the panini's.  I know it's a pizza place, but stick with me.  Their Turkey Panini was out of this world.  melting brie oozing out, perfect crunchy exterior/soft interior bread, the rasperry aoili was perfect ...and the beer list is great, although I had the same problem others have had, I struck out twice in a row ordering a beer because they didn't have it."}
{"text":"I've always loved the pizza peel over on colwick rd. So of course I was incredibly excited when I saw them open on central, in my neighborhood. After waiting for the opening madness to die down, we finally went. I just recently decided to transition to a cruel free diet..which pretty much limits my options to nothing..unfortunately they do not offer the option of cruelty free, or sometimes called certified humane, cheese (which I would totally pay more for). However, they do offer a vegan cheese. SCORE! I finally found a place I can eat at without alienating my friends, or selling a kidney. The service is wonderful! We were greeted immediately upon entry, and it never felt fake or forced. Our waiter was attentive, without being obnoxious. The manager checked on us, which was really nice. I will surely be back. The only thing I can say is, again, cruelty free cheese!!"}
{"text":"Loved the food and atmosphere!!!  First time eating here but will be back the next time I visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"We love the food, staff, and atmosphere here, BUT the beer is NOT COLD. Third time here and it's always the same. I don't care if you're busy and the glasses are coming out of the dishwasher as fast as they can and are hot. If that's your excuse, then buy more glasses. Pizza and Beer are a great combination, but not when the beer is room temp!"}
{"text":"This place has had a staff overhaul recently and I must say, for the most part, it needed it. As for the food, it's pretty exceptional! Really great wings. Lovely salads and amazing house-made dressings. And the pizza's really tasty! Their lunch buffet even has a variety of everything on the menu (not just pepperoni, veggie and cheese) and, of course, LOTS of beers to choose from.

Only complaint is the parking situation. (Parking across the street at the office building is NOT allowed.) And Friday nights are crazy kids night,...so for those of us who aren't used to spoiled, uh, I mean - hyper children running around, and looooong wait times, I'd avoid it on Fridays.

But they're patio is sweet and any other night absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"Unimpressed.  Pizza was nothing to write home about.  Specials weren't that great.   Looks like a nice place to sit outside in nice weather."}
{"text":"Nice lunch pizza and salad buffet. Lots of beers to choose from. Cool little spot to hangout."}
{"text":"I've heard pretty mixed thing about Pizza Peel but after dining here twice I think it's a very solid pizza option, especially considering the pizza landscape of Charlotte (relatively dim in my opinion).

Everyone who works there is very nice and friendly. They generally pull a decent crowd but there's always an open spot. They have a great beer selection. The atmosphere is very casual - there are some TVs and lots of outdoor seating plus their turf area where kids play or adults do yoga or play games. 

They have a good amount of vegetarian options - in fact, the pizza menu is divided by veggie or not. As far as I know they do not carry vegan cheese but if you got a pizza without cheese it should be vegan. I've had the roasted veggie and the positive friction. Roasted veggie was standard and the positive friction was AWESOME. Their pesto is a great flavor. I just wish they used fresh tomato slices instead of tiny cubes. The 8-inch is the perfect size to leave you satisfied but not crazy full. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great craft beer and funky pizza choices...standard pizza options are awesome too. Fun neighborhood...cant go wrong here."}
{"text":"According to my BF
\"Love everything on the menu except the pizza. Peel away wthe pizza and u have a great place\"."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, and the pizza is good. It doesn't have the yeasty crust with thin crispy base that I prefer, but still perfectly fine. The toppings were delicious but much too sparse. I had a veggie (caramelized garlic, goat cheese and artichokes) pizza and added caramelized onions, sundried tomatoes and blue cheese crumbles.  The flavor was excellent but only 1 sundried tomato on the whole pizza and just a few onions. 

What made this a 3 start experience was the lack of service during the second half of the meal. Our server was great until the food was delivered but then she disappeared. We waited for 20 minutes with a very antsy baby for the check before taking our credit card to the bar to pay. 

I might try this place again, but to indulge in pizza calories, it really has to be a stand out experience."}
{"text":"We visited Pizza Peel last night for the first time.  I have to admit that I was impressed.  I wasn't expecting a lot, but the atmosphere was enjoyable, as was the food. 

For starters, I noticed that Monday nights was Beer Poker for $1.50.  I asked our server what that meant because -- ignorantly -- I had never heard of that before.  Was it a special kind of beer?  No.  The server grabbed a deck of cards and my partner and I each picked a card from the deck of 52.  The type of bottled beer you get (for only $1.50!) was based on the playing card you drew.  The higher the card, the better the beer.  I drew a King.  Nice.  I was brought a German Octoberfest import.  My partner drew a Nine and was brought a dark beer of some sort I had never heard of before.  Our server told us that they don't have typical domestic beers in the mix.  I'm guessing it's usually beers that aren't moving sales-wise or, in the case of my Octoberfest, is not in season anymore.  Hey, for $1.50, I'll drink anything.  And mine was actually pretty darn good!  Regularly (not on Monday nights), Beer Poker is $2.50.  Still a fantastic deal considering the prices of other bottles of beer!

They have a pretty unique selection of specialty pizza/toppings.  For dinner, we split a 16\" Buffalo Chicken Pizza.  I have to admit: that was one damn good pizza.  It wasn't spicy (at least not for me), but it was full of flavor. The downside was that it was $20, which seems a little pricey for a large pizza.  

I'd definitely return to Pizza Peel, though...for dinner...and Beer Poker!"}
{"text":"For a fairly new Pizza joint this place is awesome. The only downside is that  the structure itself appears to be built in a former full service gas station. That is, it's inside can get kinda cramped and crowded if they are running at even half capacity. Still though, the people crowd in for the awesome pizza they have here and the great beer selection. They do pretty cool specials on different beers so if you come in during the week you can sometimes find some discounted pints to try out. Also, they have their own \"beer club\". This is a lot like Taco Mac has but kind of a mini version since Pizza Peel doesn't have 4000 beers to choose from. If you frequent a place long enough these beer clubs are pretty cool because it encourages you to try out different beers. Also, they have more than a couple local breweries included on tap which is awesome and shows they support the community. As for the food. The pizza is very good and so are the nachos and wings. The wings could actually be a little more flavorful but I'd recommend trying them out if you ever get the chance to stop in and are hungry for a app."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day. First impression = dark. Second impression = beer selection, WOW! Great beers on tap including my PBR, which of course I had to order, especially at $1.50 for a pint! Ordered the 8\" pie, and considering my recent experience at Luisa's Pizza, this was a pleasant surprise. Ordered the 8\" sausage and mushroom and it was good. Crust was crispy enough and it had good flavor. We went for a late lunch so it was not busy at all; however, I can see how it can get busy with the size of the place.

Even if you're not hungry, stop my to check out the beer selection"}
{"text":"The 2nd and newest Pizza Peel location on Central Ave is much more open (not as claustrophobic) than the original one in Cotswold.  There's also plenty of outdoor seating, whereas the Cotswold outdoor seating area is screened in and just plain awful.  The tables at Central are \"community tables,\" though, of which I'm not a big fan.  

We haven't had any problems being seated at this Pizza Peel, even on busy nights, either inside or outside, depending on our preference.  In fact, we've gone to Pizza Peel as an alternative (and were seated right away) when the wait for Peculiar Rabbit went from 30 minutes to over an hour with no explanation.  

Pizza Peel offers unique pizza topping options, not your standard cheese and pepperoni (although they do have that).  My favorite is probably the Buffalo Chicken, but I have enjoyed Thong's Thai, Greek, and Positive Friction as well (the latter two being vegetarian options).  And the 8-inch pizza under $10 is just the right size and price.  I'm so thankful, as I don't have to have a group consensus on what type of pizza to share.  I can order whatever I want.  

We've also tried the Garlic Knots appetizer to hold us over until the pizzas came.  They're big and yummy, too, and great for sharing with a group.  I have yet to try anything other than the pizza at Pizza Peel, although many times the sandwiches, salads, and pasta sound extremely appetizing as well.  

The service has always great, even though the parking for the Central Ave location can be tricky (and very limited).  Be prepared to park on one of the side streets and walk."}
{"text":"I've still only been here for beer, but with wonderful service from the lovely Jen behind the bar, I will be back.  Great beer selection and great prices.  Very similar decor as the one on Central.  I'll update my review once I've tried some of the food."}
{"text":"I popped in for a to-go order after seeing Saniqua's picture and practically drooling over how yummy it looked! 

I'm so glad that I did! 

I ordered the 8 inch Updyke. It comes with mozzarella, Italian sausage, carmelized onions, mushrooms and goat cheese topped with arugula tossed in a balsamic dressing. What's not to love about those toppings? 

When I arrived my pizza was hot and ready...And the best part was that it tasted great. I loved the fresh toppings and the super thin crust. 

I'd absolutely return from here again. I'm already looking forward to my next one!"}
{"text":"I've been twice for beers, but have yet to actually eat anything here.  That kind of limits the extent of my review.

Friendly bartenders, great beer selection, and the food at least smells good.  Really all I can say."}
{"text":"Very much a solid place in an area of town saturated with pizza spots.  I can think of no reason to avoid going here and many reasons to check it out."}
{"text":"Beer Poker! Good prices and friendly atmosphere combined with above average pizza make this one of our favorite neighborhood restaurants."}
{"text":"Service was horrible and pizza was burnt! This was incredibly disappointing as I had heard so many good things. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Oh mediocre pizza, why do you continue to haunt me?  Unfortunately the pizza was the lowest part of the trip, but since it was the reason we went, a two star review is in order.

The Great:
+  Our server was great.  She was friendly and helpful, if a bit over-eager to make sure everything was OK.  
+  WiFi.  Thanks for letting us work over our lunch!

The Average:
o  Typical pizza joint menu, but on the upside they had quite a few toppings available.

The Meh:
-  Mediocre (at best) crust.  Doughy and lacking flavor.  No offense, but it reminded me of something you'd get at a grocery store.
-  The Toppings.  While the topping list was extensive, I was simply not blown away by the flavor.  What can I say, I'm a pizza snob.

Sorry Pizza Peel - just not for me."}
{"text":"Love going here to hang out with friends and have a beer.  Greet selection of beer, and the staff is helpful when you are trying to find a new brew to sample.  
Pizza is very good too.  Overall, a very nice place to sit and relax while enjoying good beer.  Has a very cozy neighborhood feel to it, which I like, since I am long done with \"bar scene\" and the like (ie - I am too old for the loud, wild places the youngsters flock to....)."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place today and loved it! Try The Godfather pizza. This thing somehow cured my level 3 hangover. Thanks for the recommendation Grant! Great food and service!"}
{"text":"Garlic knots were the best I ever had!! The meatball pizza with extra cheese was awesome too!!"}
{"text":"The Pizza Peel was a first for us. We went with high expectations due to all of the amazing reviews. It was average at best. The garlic knots were decent. The pizza was just okay. The sauce was plain and the cheese wasn't cooked enough for my liking. Also, the garlic knots and crust were all made with wheat and not the white flour I am so accustomed to. It wasn't bad but I don't think I'll be coming back. There are too many other great pizza options in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My go to place when im in the plaza,  really nice, airy, and cool decor, good nc beer selection, and solid pizza.  All in all a great place to sit back, watch a game, drink a beer, and have a slice."}
{"text":"I love their pizza. It is always delicious and creative. Their beer selection is good. Standard craft brands, with the occasional surprise. The only reason I did not say four stars is because their hostesses are young,  inexperienced and unhelpful. They are the first people you encounter and I have never had a positive experience. Once one told me \"good luck\" at finding a place at the bar during a game day. I understand, but maybe try a little finesse? The food helps me overlook the irritation caused by their hostess staff."}
{"text":"The Pizza Peel was  on our to-do list for awhile. We went with high expectations due to all of the amazing reviews. It was average at best. The garlic knots were decent. The pizza was just okay. The sauce was plain and the cheese wasn't cooked enough for my liking.  It wasn't bad but I don't think I'll be coming back. There are too many other great pizza options in Charlotte. If I do come back, I will probably have to try something else."}
{"text":"One of my favorites. Great beer selection that always changes. Servers and bartenders are very friendly and know their beer. Pizza is wonderful too. I recommend the Heart Stopper - lots of meat! Only thing that keeps this from being 5 stars are the Friday nights being overrun by children. Wait until after 8 to go."}
{"text":"Came here solo on a Saturday afternoon.  Very family friendly, given the number of kids playing outside and enjoying pizza inside.  I opted for the Italian sandwich, which was good.  The sweet potato fries are of the frozen variety and the service was on the slow side.  Overall, it was decent, but there's some room for improvement."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Went on Carolina beer night, where all beers from Carolina are $3. Husband and I both ordered one of the highlighted beers on the menu- 2 different IPAs, both were very good.  Make sure you verify the check- one of the beers was charged at the special price and the other at full but once it was brought to the attention of the waitress she took care of it with no issues! 

We started with the bruschetta and found it to be very good. The asiago cheese mixture was seriously addictive and kept me going back for so many little pieces of toast that I was afraid I wouldn't be able to eat my pizza. 

I ordered the create your own pizza with double cheese (mozz and cheddar) and the husband got the BBQ pizza. Both were good, but nothing that I find myself craving and feeling the need to rush back for. 

Overall a good experience and I'll most likely go back, but there are too many other places I want to try out first."}
{"text":"Mid afternoon, not too crowded. Appetizers of wings and chips were pretty good. Food took a really long time, so long that I ended up getting it to go. My waitress ended up comping off the wings. Not the place to go if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"TL; DR version- pretty good pizza, lots of beers, slow service.

Stopped in recently on the recommendation from a buddy without reading the reviews first (wait, what!). The restaurant itself was smaller than I expected, but they do pack the tables in. I was told there was outdoor dining, but I missed this? It was too hot for outdoor dining in June anyway! 

We stopped in around 9pm or so on a Friday night. Most people were situated at the bar at that point; there were maybe 4 tables seated throughout the place. Our waitress stopped by really quickly to get us menus and take our drink orders. As there were pages of beers, which is awesome, and I had never been here before, I wanted a second to choose something. This was my first mistake. We did not see her again for probably about 10 minutes. Well, that's not true- I saw her around the restaurant (chatting by the bar, checking her phone, etc), but couldn't get her attention. We weren't in a hurry and were just hanging out, but I did really want to get a drink... 
Finally got her attention and got our drink and food orders in. We each ordered a small pizza- I got the El Blanco, he got the Updyke. Then we waited. We each finished a beer, ordered another, and got the second round of beers with no pizza in sight. Almost a half hour after ordering our food, our waitress stopped by to let us know that they had to remake one of our pizzas... okay... but 30 minutes and then they needed to remake one? Apparently it was the El Blanco that needed to be remade, as mine arrived piping hot and the Updyke arrived lukewarm/semi cold. 

Now, the food is good. I'm a pizza snob for sure, and I thought it was yummy. Was it NY/NJ pizza good? No. But the crust was a good mix of crunchy on the outside and doughy on the inside, and the toppings were fresh and cooked well. Would we have been happier if we could have eaten our food 15 minutes earlier? Yes. 

Seems like they have a bunch of good deals running throughout the week, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"This rustic little neighborhood joint offers tasty pizza and  a ginormous selection of beer on tap and by the bottle. They have a nice selection of salads as well."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in CLT. Ask for the secret menu and order The Godfather. It's served with an awesome vinaigrette drizzle. 

Nice patio for pretty days and great draft beer selection with all the local brews and a couple west coast ales too!"}
{"text":"I replied to your response to my review. 

My reviews are fair and honest with no hidden agendas. 

Period. 

If Honesty and the truth offends you, I'm sorry.

Do you prefer dishonesty?

Ive got a teenager who read your reply and alerted me to it and said this guy 'is being facetious, dont bother responding'. 

Do you find it odd a teenager knows the definition of the word facetious and can see that is exactly the tone of your reply??

He pointed out how, where and why you were being facetious in every sentence of your response. 

I think it is best to again say any review I make I make with no other agenda other then to be fair and honest. Nothing more. If you wish to take this seriously and not be facetious and allowing a teenager to see the facetious (his words, not mine, but its fun repeating seeing as how a teenager see's right thru the B.S.) nature of your reply, im sure he would be more then willing to speak with you directly and perhaps teach you a lesson. 

In Vocabulary as well as life. Best wishes. Im sorry you did not like my review. Im far more sorry a teenager could see the insincere nature/tone of your response quite easily and again, if you wish to discuss this further, I'd be more then happy to arrange a meeting between you and him face to face and you can then add humble pie to your menu courtesy of a teenager who is far smart enough to see things more clearly then you realize."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday around noon hoping to try The Mellow Mushroom.  When we discovered that there was no such pizza place at the address, we decided to try The Pizza Peel.

There was only one server at the time running 3-4 active tables.  We wanted the pizza buffet, on which were no pizzas at the time because the autistic man in his 20s took the only pie that was on the buffet.  :(

The chef, caught unprepared, asked us exactly what toppings we wanted.  Of course, I ordered Hawaiian.  It was delicious and well worth the wait and trouble.

For making us wait, the waitress deducted a fair amount of money from my bill."}
{"text":"This review is just to tell you about $3 dollar local draft beers on Thurs. nights & fish tacos - who would have ever guessed that the fish tacos were this good at Pizza Peel not this girl but they surprised me.   2 huge tacos with spicy tilapia \"grilled\" not fried YAY! and some yummy chipotle sauce spot on."}
{"text":"Always been a huge fan of The Pizza Peel and was lucky enough to check out the new spot in Plaza upon a recent weekend visit. It's the same as the good ol' original in Cotswold, but with a slightly different interior layout and a much more awesome patio. 

Same great beer selection, amazing fish tacos (of which I will argue are the best in town), and that killer Secret Pizza Menu. Definitely worth a gander if you've never had a chance to do so. 

The factor that makes me want this location in the ATL is the disc golf basket out front. Not only is it a perfect distraction for the kids to go out and play, but it's a great way to kill some time al fresco with a beer in hand. Really love what they've done with this spot. A definite plus to the choices in Plaza."}
{"text":"The decor was very nice. We sat by the garage style doors and it was nice to feel the breeze while eating. The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I had the curry egg rolls as an appetizer and I was so amazed at how good they were!! You must try them if you like curry chicken!! I wasn't very impressed with my BBQ chicken pizza. I'm definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"I probably should have read the reviews but it had been a long day of moving and we were in the mood for pizza...I say Ehhh. We got the supreme pizza and while it was loaded with veggies, it didn't have anything that would make me want to come back. The pizza was kinda bland and could use something else. Maybe it's the sauce? For $23, it wasn't near the pizza I was hoping for. I really wanted to forego a pizza chain and do local but this isn't the place I'll go back. Maybe I'll try other menu items. I guess I now know why it seemed kinda empty on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, great beer selection, knowledgable bartenders and friendly staff. Great outdoor area for kids/music."}
{"text":"So... Probably the best pizza in Charlotte. Tried the Updyke pizza and it was simply fantastic. Great atmosphere, great service, and was impressed by the management.  Definitely will return here."}
{"text":"Looking for a good pizza joint in Cotswold? Pizza Peel (or is it Pizza n Peel?) is an unpretentious place with great beverage and food specials and an awesome staff.

The pizza is made in a brick oven and personal-sized pizza is around $8-9.  Crispy crust, fresh ingredients.

The other selling point is the ambience  The wait staff are very amicable folks who don't mind mingling with the customers.  I once curried the favor of a manger who let me take home a nifty pint glass for free.  Who else does that?  The place is real cozy; its small and gets crowded on weekends at night.  At such times, the service lapses somewhat. But if you can take a long lunch, hit up Pizza Peel.  Or if you're bored on a weeknight, you can play trivia in a place small enough to hurl banter at opponents on the opposite end of the restaurant.  Ya'll gonna love it, ya hear?"}
{"text":"About 5 years ago when I first moved to Charlotte, my old car needed a new set of tires and an oil change. After calling around and doing my best negotiation attempts, I ended up taking my car to a little shop in Plaza Midwood who did a decent job. Fast forward a few years and that old car is gone (and not missed!) and that same garage is transformed into a hip pizza joint. I think it's a neat story that seems to be as good of an analogy as any to the rapid growth and transformation of the city. Anyways, the Pizza Peel definitely has a vibe all it's own and is a neat place to hang out in a very competitive foodie part of town. I would splurge to get one of the specialty pies as they seem to put a bit more into them. Also I appreciate the wide selection of local drafts to compliment your pizza. As for entertainment, they take full advantage of the green space out front where I have seen everything from Yoga classes to large drum circles. Stay funky Plaza Midwood!"}
{"text":"I've been here once before and thought the pizza was decent. But this past Sunday my boyfriend and I came around 9pm. We were hesitant to come late on a Sunday considering I'm a server and he works in the kitchen.. And we know how dead it is anywhere on a Sunday night. But we bit the bullet because we saw plenty of people outside eating. We asked the hostess if we could sit outside and so she sat us accordingly.. So we continued to wait for literally 15 minutes.. and no one came up to greet us or anything. I watched a server pass us numerous times and look us directly in the eyes but didn't care about greeting us at all because it was clear we weren't her table, regardless of how long we had been sitting there without service or not. So after sitting there for that long I just wanted a beer and some food for the love of god! So we walked over to Thomas street and got our fix. It's a shame, can't get good service anywhere anymore."}
{"text":"I love finding small, hole in the wall places, and the Pizza Peel fits this description perfectly.  We had a large group arrive for a New Year's Day casual dinner.  Since there were only about 12 tables in the entire place, we clearly knew where we were sitting.  

Service was good, and the beer list, as many have said, was extremely extensive.  I believe they have more than 20 beers on tap.  Pizza was also good, though not out of this world.  The best thing on the menu that night was probably this New Year's Day lucky soup - with chickpeas, collard greens, rice, and bacon - so good.  

Take some friends and have some of their delicious pizza and beer."}
{"text":"Tasty food. I'm partial to the Pizza Peel in Cotswald, just because I've been there more often, but this one is almost just as good. I like that this one has a nice outdoor area to spend some time hanging out in the sun. The garlic knots were good, but the fish tacos I got weren't my favorite. They were good, but I've yet to meet that fish taco that really does it for me."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times...here's what stands out....

...many, many beers on draft - lots of local brews, pretty much anything you could ask for.

....chicken curry rolls and wings are both straight.  I also like the shrimp tacos.

...Music Trivia with Evan on Wednesdays!!

...Parking can be tight, get in where you fit in.

...Service is always great!!  Definitely worth a try if you haven't been here before!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal! I ordered the Peel Baked Ziti and it was some of the best pasta i've had. The portions are large and very reasonable for the price. We ordered the garlic knots as an appetizer and they were delicious as well. They are actually more like breadsticks than knots and 4 was enough for two people. My boyfriend ordered the meatball sub and he said it was the best one he has ever had. I highly recommend eating here for great priced Italian!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and had their lunch buffet, which comes with a side salad.  We ordered the salad which came about 20 minutes later.  After the salads were brought to us, the waitress never came back, so we never got refills of our drinks.  There is a lot of outdoor seating and lots of space for kids to play, but the service was terrible.  The pizza was pretty decent - it's a buffet style with 3-4 rotating types of pizza.  Overall though, the service needs to be greatly improved."}
{"text":"Whether you need a quick lunch or many drinks at the bar this place is great.  The lunch is a buffet with salad (the salad isbserved at your table so it's not getting sneezed on).  
I usually come in the evening and enjoy the curry eggrolls, garlic knots, buffalo chicken pizza, and a D9 viking.  The beer selection hits the high points of the local beer scene and the bartenders are great."}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. In. Charlotte!!! 

I love, Love, LOVE Pizza Peel. Luckily, it's just around the corner from our house & even though I try to eat healthy it doesn't take much effort for Joe to twist my arm and \"make\" me eat at \"the Peel.\" In addition to having absolutely phenomenal pizza, Pizza Peel has a very diverse beer selection, is a great place to watch sporting events, has yummy sandwiches and the best house salad in town. 

Pizza Peel is definitely not a place to go to if you want to have a nice quiet dinner, but it's always a good time and fun for the whole family.. they even have a magician on Friday nights for the kids! 

Definitely ask for the secret menu and don't be afraid to order the mystery beer... we haven't been let down yet by the selection!"}
{"text":"Tried this place when it first opened and found the sauce too sweet for my taste. Went back recently and enjoyed a cheese pizza and some garlic knots. Their small pies are a great portion for an individual or not-too-hungry couple to split. The garlic knots are very garlicy and quite tasty, not overly fried like some can taste like. Parking can be difficult but you can snag spaces in the lot at the dry cleaner's next door or the office space across the street if it's available. There are multiple tvs to watch sports while enjoying pizza and beer."}
{"text":"Great menu with all good choices. I like the nachos and of course the pizza. My go to is the Thai pizza or the pepperoni. Nachos are also a good choice for your palate. Good beer choices too. 

Enjoy yourself at the Peel."}
{"text":"Just so you know it does get very loud in here. We started with the garlic knots based on the many reviews on it. Unfortunately these garlic knots didn't really hit the mark. There was nothing garlicky about it. And their pizza's were just alright. It certainly isn't made of the regular pizza dough we are normally familiar with. Although our food was somewhat average, we truly appreciate the service in here. They were on top of it and some elderly gentleman whom we assume is the owner/manager was very hospitable."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I ordered garlic knots and the BBQ chicken pizza. However, the customer service was horrible. The waiter passed my table several times without even asking if we enjoyed the food. My glass was only filled once which was the time they actually brought the glass to the table. We were well finished with our food and still hadn't been asked if we were ready for our check. I ended up having to ask for the check. Although the food was great, I will probably never visit this establishment again because of the service."}
{"text":"We went to Pizza Peel to celebrate another Straight A year for my teenager-Service was excellent- \"Mystery Beers\" were a great value & fun way to try something new.  The pizzas were all 3 different and excellent!
Look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for a long time and did so today for the lunch buffet. Great service all around and a low key easy atmosphere - both score well in my book. The salad was fresh and delicious. The pizza was good - I prefer mine a little thinner but it was still fresh and the buffet was well stocked on both visits. Definitely a great place that I'll return to."}
{"text":"First time at Pizza Peel and first beer \"class.\" I cannot speak to their food, since I went with the intention of learning about beers from the Pizza Peel Beer Goddess event.

I'm not a beer drinker, but I'm very much for trying new things or learning about things...so when the beer class was offered, I was excited to go! A bunch of us ladies showed up and filled their heated and enclosed patio. Brian was a great teacher and was very knowledgeable about the beer making process (even passed around barley and hops). Did you know that hops not only makes beer bitter, but also works like a preservative? *Call me, A+ student*

We tried about a half-dozen types of beers...I should have taken notes, but just remember some were light and others were dark, some tasted like grapefruit and some like coffee, some smelled decent while others smelled not so decent. I guess beer is an acquired taste and one that I don't have yet...but I can appreciate the process and variety. By the way, they have a huge list of beers!

This same class is open to the public every Wednesday night in the month of February starting at 6:30pm. Next week, lagers or ports will be the focus. 

The restaurant itself stayed busy and many people stopped by to pick up food to go. Next time I'm here I'll check out their pizza since I've read so many good reviews."}
{"text":"Went here on a weekend around 3 or 4pm . We were seated very quickly and the service was a great. It's a kid-friendly restaurant and the food was quite good, and I really liked the decor--they tried to keep the spirit of the garage that once was there, which all MIdwoodians appreciate. I enjoyed being there at an off-time. While it wasn't crowded, it wasn't empty at all, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves and having a good time. I also especially appreciated how nice the servers were consider I had an overly rambunctious toddler in tow. Great place."}
{"text":"Just a regular pizza joint dressed for uptown. Not impressed."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice. The server was pretty nice. We(hubby & I) were the only customers at the time.  Others came while we were seated. I love how they head the huge screens to give it a patio feel! We had the Chicken Pesto Pizza it was delicious! I will definitely be visiting again for more pizza and to try drinks!"}
{"text":"Its no better than the other one. Lousy service and marginal pizza.  Just a millennial trendy place. Good selection of beers, but only fair wine. Good live music Saturday night. Not a long wait mid evening."}
{"text":"A pizza place right next to a Krispy Kreme?  Yes, please.

On a bank holiday Monday, early for lunch, I easily found The Pizza Peel.  Parking is limited and a bit narrow, but since I was there before, well, everyone, I found a spot and settled in to wait on my hot date.  

The entire wait staff was fantastic.  Friendly, drinks were kept filled, the one change I made to the pizza order was met with a 'no problem'.  Prices are on par for pizza places that aren't chains

My order of an 8\" Positive Friction (sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, tomatoes, pesto, mozz cheese and I asked for goat cheese instead of feta) arrived quickly and smoking hot.  Toppings were of a proper amount and proportionately covering the pie.  As someone who prefers choices other than tomato-sauced pizzas, they had a very nice selection.  Also, their vegetarian menu is creative and fantastic.  

I will definitely be returning to The Pizza Peel!"}
{"text":"We tried Pizza Peel because they are opening closer to us in Plaza Midwood and it was very disappointing. I did not care for the pizza; too sweet and the crust very doughy. The nachos were some of the worst I've had, even though the server said they were very good. They are made with a cheese sauce which was lukewarm at best, the chips stale and the presentation awful. I like real cheese on my nachos. The menu doesn't say it has beans but there are beans all over it. The beer list is above average. The service very flat. 
Lucky for them there aren't many good restaurants in Cotswold. Plaza Midwood on the other hand is a different story."}
{"text":"Please reference photo!!! I am so disappointed with the price and quality of my pizzas I got tonight. We ordered 2 pizzas 8 inch, they charge about a dollar for every single topping you add to your pizza. They even charge 55 cents for BBQ sauce, what the crap! Most pizza places offer a few sauces and such at no charge. Also if you are going to charge then you better put a good amount of each topping on my pizza, ESPECIALLY when I note please put lots of goat cheese. 

I am attaching a photo of my pizza from Pizza Peel that I got tonight (on right, round pizza) and next to it is a competitor (zablongs, flatbread style) here is what I see: 

Pizza Peel $12 for a pizza with hardly any toppings, 4 slices. Mostly bread and crust. I had 5 pieces of prosciutto, 5 clumps of goat cheese, 4 pieces of chicken. NOT WORTH THE MONEY! 

Zablongs $10 unlimited toppings, wheat crust for no up charge, 8 slices. When you ask for extra goat cheese you actually get it. Customer service of the employee writing your name in BBQ sauce, oh yeah which is included in the price and they honor 10% cash back for Yelp members. 

I have no idea why I would ever go to Pizza Peel again."}
{"text":"really awesome breaded wings - large, crunchy, and good amount of sauce. great pizzas too but their wings are the best!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting little place. Kind of small and crowded, but not to the point of being obnoxious. The place seems like a nice little neighborhood joint, a refreshing change from all of the chain restaurants that are cold and completely devoid of any real character. 

The tap list was fairly decent, with a definite slant toward local and regional offerings. The only disappointment was that it leaned to heavily on IPA's, DIPA's, and Stouts not nearly enough representation of other styles. 

The service was pretty good, the waitress was helpful, and my beer glass never sat empty (always a good sign). The on staff beer guy was knowledgeable and friendly, and eager to talk beer. 

The food was good; better than the chain pizza places, but not quite as good as Luigi's or Mellow Mushroom. A little pricey but not too bad."}
{"text":"Yum! Definitely order one of the specialty pizzas, they are really good. If you make your own I feel like they skimp a bit on the toppings. Also, on Mondays it is $3 NC pint draughts."}
{"text":"On the premise of being a simple pizza  joint this place feels authentic and genuine. It has Pizza selections to satisfy even the most hardened pie connesuiers. Additionally if you like local brews they have a wild selection of delicious local brews that will enrich a palette and make you smile. It's a refreshing take on a pizza joint and it is one you sure will come back to."}
{"text":"There's alot to like about Pizza Peel. The lunch special is a buffet of pizza, drink, and a salad. The toppings and crust are both flavorful, and their salads are surprisingly great too. I'm all for Dominoes or Papa Johns as much as the next guy, but Pizza Peel is where I'd go for a great pie. 

They have dozens of beers on tap, and a nice variety of other dishes. I haven't tried anything but the pizza buffet, but based on that experience, I'd easily go back for dinner. 

The only knock I have against them is their prices. Everything seems a little high, and $20 for a large pizza is a tough pill to swallow. But the quality is good, and the staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Staff is very friendly and attentive. All the food I have tried here is consistently well prepared and tasty. They have a nice selection of foods that provide a wide variety of tastes for everyone. There is a wonderful covered outdoor eating area as well as a play area."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with my husband for a quick beer and appetizer one evening. We had the bruschetta which was pretty delicious and then some local brews. 
They had a good beer selection which was a plus. Our waitress was really nice and attentive as was the hostess. 
We haven't tried their pizza yet but plan to. Will update accordingly!"}
{"text":"Great beer specials on Mondays but the lighting was bad and the Menu is hard to read!"}
{"text":"Good veggie pizza(wish the roasted garlic came crushed) and buffalo wings. My garlic knots are black at the bottom so not a fan of them sending this out with my pizza. Was delivered via FoodieCall excellently. Will eat here again."}
{"text":"Meh, I'm not getting why this place is so crazy busy. The salad was OK. The garlic knots bread was good, but weren't garlicky enough.  They needed to be rolled with garlic. 
The curry rolls were actually curry spring rolls. Those were tasty! 
The pizza was just average.
The server was super friendly, but the rest of the staff was pretty unhappy. Just seemed to be giving off some sad juju here.What's up with that?"}
{"text":"Great service and good food, maybe even great food.  Location is nice with indoor and outdoor seating.  Pizza is not too thick or thin and they made it perfectly well done as we asked.  My wifes pizza was a little light on toppings but mine was just right."}
{"text":"Love the outside curb appeal, nice outside seating. We got One Veggie and roasted veggie. Honestly, didn't care for roasted veggie at all. Tasted like a can of roasted veggies and then had some mush eggplant sauce thing, unappetizing in color of that. My daughter loved One Veggie and she says the goat cheese was good and generous. The soup we had was the best part of it all.. A chicken lemon rice that looked like a veggie rice but was fantastic. Honestly, wouldn't come back because there's so many other pizza options."}
{"text":"Pizza with Red Onion (you can get the other kind of Onion if you wish) and Garlic Knots almost the size of Pretzels!  

My rating of Five stars means it is one of my favorite places to get Pizza and that everything I want in a Pizza was executed very well here both times I've been here.  Here is the rundown and yelp star ratings on the components:

Pizza Sauce: great flavor better than most, 4.85 yelp stars

Pizza Crust: Thin and thinner than many, great flavor 4.9 stars

Cheese: YAY!  A strict Mozzarella (no blend YAY!) perfect volume 5 stars

Red Onion: Great flavor and sliced perfectly THIN! !! !!! 4.75 stars

Garlic Knots: Totally Fresh! BIG 5 stars on size, 3.9 stars on flavor, tasted like canned powdered Parmesan Cheese, mixed with plenty of fresh Garlic!  It is doubtfully I would be dating someone who dose not LOVE Garlic (unless it was a first Date)!

Marinara Sauce: with a little Cheese very good 4.75 stars

The Servers here are great, all have very outgoing personalities with great sense of humor and I asked each of them who the Funniest server was they could only agree that the one wearing a Pig on her \"chefs\" hat was the Craziest!  My server almost qualified for Superboy on Pizza palace (no crown) though it would still take a little work.

I walked in last Wednesday evening and I had that \"yelp is in the air\" feeling when I saw the Bar LOADED with beautiful ladies of  yelp I did not think I would be recognized so I took a Table right beside them... Then as they were moving to the Outdoor area (Plasticed in for the winter) I saw PINK (not the Rock star) the POPROCK star Tonya P. P for POPROCK LOVE (you know her as Poprock Photography) I knew my cover was blown now, yet I was wrong, she did not tell anyone who I was!  YAY!  Thanks Poprock LOVE!"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood favorite of ours. It is close, fast and the food is always good. They have a variety of menu options and a GREAT beer selection...including a Beer Club. Watch out for that Beer Club, it can quickly become a competition between friends. We even caught each other sneaking off to go add to their list without telling the others...I would say \"sneaking people\" but I was definitely one of them. I guess that is the competitor in me.

I have had everything from garlic knots to salad, pizza to soup and it has all been good. They have great specials every night...including $1.50 Beer Poker on Monday night. This is definitely one of the more consistently busy places in the Cotswold Area, but compared to the other restaurants in the area I understand why. I would definitely recommend The Pizza Peel for a low key night of beer and pizza."}
{"text":"Had heard mixed reviews about The Pizza Peel, but finally decided to try it with my fiance. Starting with drinks, she got the Basil Lemonade (which I sampled) and we were both fans. Sweet and tangy with a little kick at the end from the rum. The beer selection is not out of this world, but what they have serve a great purpose. Your small sampling of Bud/Coors/Miller and then a great assortment of local and national craft brews. I settled on the Asheville Brewing Co. Shiva IPA. Definitely a strong choice. 

Coming to the pizza, the fiance settled on one of the limited specials, the \"Kimbo Slice\", which had the defining feature of Granny Smith Apple slices. Same as the drink, a nice little twang to it. I chose the pizza that best fit my lifestyle, the Sorry For Partying Supreme. Three different meats, three different peppers, definitely one of the best pizzas I have had this year. 

Service was run-of-the-mill, no complaints. Atmosphere was a little loud, but it's a pizza joint/bar, again no complaints. Will definitely be returning and would definitely recommend if you're looking for some \"designer pizza\"."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. 
Is this place under new management? I've had pizza here a couple of times before and I can't remember it being this bad. 

Here's what I objected to: The individual pizza is 8\" but because they leave a fat roll of dough all around the cheese and toppings only cover a 6\" area (that's small). 

The crust is chewy and it doesn't get crunchy although the pies were well baked. It's also not very flavorful. The cheese layer is minimal, which works with thin crust pizza only this is thick crust so no it doesn't work. The veggie toppings are of OK quality but cut to tiny, tiny pieces and very sparse. I think I got one small mushroom cut into 4 pieces, same with grilled pepper, artichoke etc. Result was  totally underwhelming.

Meat wise I ordered chorizo stupidly expecting a few slices of Spanish chorizo instead it was some ground meat with Cumin instead of cured meat with paprika. MEH!

I'm not going to detail the other pizza but it was very much the same. Like the waitress said: \"Voila, y'all!\" I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"Pizza Peel is down the road from our house and we LOVE it. We come here often and have tried quite a lot on the menu, everything has been good. The pizza is very good, but the teriyaki wings are my favorite. They're huge and crispy. Service is always fantastic and the manager or owner (not too sure which) always comes over and says hello. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am a pizza fanatic.  I am not too particular about the crust or the flavors of the pizza, I just want my pizza topped with an odd combination: pineapple and a nut (walnuts, almonds, pecans).  

I ran into Pizza Peel late last night and asked for a pineapple and walnut pizza to go with ranch on the side.  The bartender advised it would be about 10min - perfect!  She rang me up and I paid with credit.card.  She brought me the pizza and I informed her there wasn't the side of ranch.  She said she was sorry and would get it.  She rang me up for a side of ranch for 54 cents.  And I waited for her to take my credit card, once again, and bring me the side of ranch.  I waited, and waited, and waited.  All while watching her maintain a conversation wtih a group at the bar, eat ice-cream out of their bowl and overlook other customers needs, as well as my own.  It took 5 min for the ranch to come out.  The manager brought it and said that I would not need to be charged the 54 cents.  I thanked him and went home.  I got home to discover that the pizza was extremely spicey.  I called back and asked what they had put on the pizza, and the same bartender said she thinks they may have put chipotle sauce on instead of regular.  She said she would have them make a new one now.  I ran back up the street and the manager provided a $10 credit for my next purchase.  When I got back home with my pizza it was missing the walnuts.  

I think this is a great location for a pizza place, a cool indoor and outdoor environment, and great beer-on-tap selection; however, I do not think the bartender had any intention of providing service to anyone other than her friends at the bar.  It is unsanitary and discomforting to see wait-staff eating out of a customer's dish and then handle your food.  She was rude, inconsiderate of the customer's needs, and lacked any attention to detail."}
{"text":"This is a really neat pizza spot! I came here with my brother and a friend to check it out. When you walk in, it's sort of a chilled bar family atmosphere. You'll see families eating and the ceiling gives you a sense of a nice country home feeling.

So. Here's what's up. They only have two sizes of pizzas here. A 8\" and a 16\", and priced at $8 and $20 respectively it's kind of weird. I would think double the size would be double the price, but it isn't the case. This is what I ate when I came:

1. For appetizers we ordered wings and nachos. Me personally, I felt the nachos didn't do justice. The amount of beef and stuff that came with it didn't balance. My brother would have gotten the house chips instead, as he was eyeing it when he was walking out at another table. The wings, we mixed the sauces of teriyaki and buffalo so it turned out pretty good. It had a kick and at the same time the sweet taste came in to accompany it. I enjoyed that.

2. Pizza. We decided for 3 we a 20\" would be just fine. I believe we got a specialty pizza with onions, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, pepperoni, and I believe bell pepper? I have a photo attached, but I don't know really what it was called. I enjoyed the pizza because it didn't have any weird taste like some pizza spots and it just went well. (It got me full!)

Overall, my experience was positive. The service was nice, and the waiter was very helpful in choosing what was tasty! I will definitely come back if I'm in the area and craving for pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was freshly made with ingredients of my choosing! Very good sauce and nice texture! First time here and will definitely be back. My friend is a pizza lover and he said that he liked his pizza!! Server was knowledgeable and checked on us frequently but not too much! He came with refills without us having to ask for them! Atmosphere has dim lighting and much like a sports bar; big screens, music overhead in speakers... Worth it!"}
{"text":"Three words - chicken curry rolls!  Even if you're not into beer and music and football the food is outstanding.  There is a porch/veranda section as well that is covered with clear plastic and heated if the inside ambiance is not cozy enough.  This is a great little place tucked back in Cotswald right next to Krispy Kreme.  A hidden gem most nights though the drink specials seem to bring out more of the crowds.  Great, attentive, friendly waitresses as well."}
{"text":"There beer special  wasn't amazing but there vegetarian menu was amazing ! I loved the black bean sandwich. Must try!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place thanks to an article on local pizza places in one of those free weeklies found around town and so glad I did! I met my friend for dinner on a Friday night a couple weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait. I arrived around 6:45 p.m. and was immediately seated at the table where my friend had already been waiting. Although for some reason, children seemed to be the overwhelming demographic that night so the place was L-O-U-D.

We both ordered the pumpkin beers on tap (highly recommend!) and I ordered the Thai's Tong pizza. This is not the place to expect 'typical' pizza offerings but the pizzas are perfectly sized for individual consumption (cuz I'm greedy but if you're not, they're good for sharing too). The thai's tong pizza was delicious, not too much heat and not too much sweetness. A nice blend of the two flavors. I always judge a pizza by its crust and I'm happy to report the crust is on the thinner side and lightly crispy.

Pizza Peel is located directly across the street from Zada Jane's and my only gripe about the place is that the parking lot is quite small so you'll have to rely on street parking or the lot across the street (if it's not peak hours)."}
{"text":"This pizza was refreshingly delicious. Flavorful and light. I will be going over and over."}
{"text":"Delicious. Good service. Great pizza combinations. Must ask for the secret menu. It has some of the most original pizza concoctions."}
{"text":"Pizza Peel has a large selection of beers on tap. The house made chips and the feta dip are my favorite appetizers. The lunch buffet is a good deal - $8.50 for a drink, salad, and all you can eat slices. If they don't have it on the buffet, they'll usually take requests. Weekly pizza specials benefit an area charity. Pizza is a tad bland at times, but overall I really like the quality. The staff is friendly, too."}
{"text":"I've heard many good things about The Pizza Peel for years, but I finally made it in here today with a quick light dinner with my daughter. Everything was great. Loved my House Salad with dried cranberries & walnuts & blue cheese crumbles & vinaigrette dressing. Daughter had the Chicken Pesto wrap and it's a good thing she didn't leave the table because I might have eaten half of that too! The homemade chips were some of the best I've ever had. Can't wait to go back and actually try the Pizza and amazing beer selection!"}
{"text":"I visited them for the first time and i could say it is the best pizza so far i ever had in the charlotte area. They have a big menu and some good specialities. Great ambiance and beer. If you like pizza this is a place that you need to try. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I've been twice. First time was so packed it was a 20 minute wait with no where to wait... The second time was much better. Got a table within 10 minutes and served by one of the funniest servers I have ever met. The BBQ Chicken Pizza is quite amazing. I would recommend trying it out. Their selection of beer is also impressive. The bartenders are a bit slow though. But overall, I will be visiting each month."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I cannot rate Pizza Peel-Central on the food. My wife and I live uptown and are regulars at Hawthornes. One of her friends recommended Pizza Peel, so we gave it a shot tonight. The hostesses were absolutely gracious and very welcoming. This was our very first time even setting foot in this place. After giving our name for a table, we decided to head to the bar for a drink. The place was crowded. The female bartender came over to me and looked right at me. No smile, no welcome, she just stared at me, waiting for me to initiate the greeting. I said \"How are you tonight?\" She continued to stare at me, no smile, no \"great thanks, what can I get you\"? So I thought maybe she didn't hear me, so I said again, \"How are you tonight?\" Still nothing? She wanted no part of being welcoming or nice. She was absolutely rude & obnoxious. Made me feel so unwelcome. We go out to dinner often and always \"talk up\" great places to friends, co workers, etc.....This female bartender absolutely blew it! We left, kindly asked the hostesses to take our names off the wait list and shared our experience with them. The hostesses were apologetic and very professional. Sad part is, they were probably in their late teens and they were so much more professional, kind, courteous and customer service oriented than the female bartender. I will not be going back. I have the choice to spend my dining, drinking money at so many places near where we live. Charlotte has so many opportunities. It is too bad that one grumpy, disrespectful and obnoxious bartender can ruin an experience not just for one couple, but all the other people we will be sharing our experience with."}
{"text":"Came in on opening night. Good local and NC beer selection. Ordered some small pizzas and we were not disappointed. Staff was friendly and things went very smoothly (especially for an opening night). Will return."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating dinner at the new Plaza Midwood Pizza Peel. I'd eaten at the Cotswold one once or twice but it never really blew my skirt up for some reason. I really like the Plaza Midwood location though. I got there early and sipped on a Brooklyn Porter while I waited for the hubs to meet me after work. (The draft beer list is good - something for everyone I think.) The waitress was super friendly and let me sit there and read my book in peace while I waited and drank my beer. Hubs showed up after about ten minutes and we started perusing the menu. 

We both decided on pizza, though last time I had one of the pastas and it was really good. I was curious to try the pizza to see how it compared to the other spot. Turns out it's way better. The crust was thin but not crispy and there was just the right amount of cheese and sauce. It seemed a lot less greasy than the one I had at Cotswold too. I like my pizza plain, but hubs tried the hot chipotle tomato sauce and some meats (and anchovies, ew). He was super excited about his pie and he's pretty picky about REALLY liking something. I tend to think he LIKES just about everything, but raves about very few things. So I knew it must be good. I think the flavor, consistency and ingredients all came together nicely and it was just really good, simple pizza. 

This location does get pretty noisy when it gets busy, which I experienced last time but not this one. It was a slower night. Also, the patio comprises a few long picnic tables, so even though it was beautiful outside, I opted to sit inside since there were only going to be two of us. But we were seated right next to one of the large garage door windows, which was open to a screen door and it let in some of the lovely afternoon. It's a good spot to people watch as people walk by on Central.

All in all, this was a really positive visit with good food and good service. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in last minute because another place couldn't guarantee us seating. Seating was prompt. But service from the beginning was lacking. Drinks were forgotten. The gum underneath the table that I kept hitting with my hands and legs was not appetizing but also not their fault. Eventually the flow caught up with the whole experience and the service was prompt and efficient and the food was excellent. I split the blanco pizza with two other girls and I thought it was awesome! You can tell fresh ingredients were used! Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and both times, I've really enjoyed myself. I'm a little worn on the bar-scene, and it feels a little bar-y in there...but, the food is good, the atmosphere is laid back, and the prices aren't so bad. They've got lots of great promotions (Groupons, etc.) as well, so it's not too hard to find a way to check the out on the cheap."}
{"text":"The last two times I've been here the pizza has been bad...I don't know if they've changed some of their ingredients since they first opened or what.  But the crust was hard, not chewy not edible.  I ordered the Updyke and Supreme pizza spit in half and should have just went to Papa Johns and saved some money.  I'm disappointed because I live close by and this place is a great fit for the hood.  Also the last time I went the chicken curry rolls were like $2 per roll...a bit much for such a tiny roll."}
{"text":"Bday eat fest continued...started with the peel ribs which were pretty good, the BBQ sauce reminded me a little too much of pizza sauce but again, pretty good. The pizza on the other hand was really good.  As I was staring at my wife and kids thru semi food induced comatose eyes, I could see the pleasure in their quasi comatose eyes too (I did say eat fest didn't i?:))  anyway good sausage, good sauce, great crust, good mushrooms, good wine, great atmosphere!  Highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"Yum baby Yum!!
Went here with my husband for lunch! Best pizza I've had in a while. I don't remember the name of my pizza but it had arugula, goat cheese, and balsamic vinegar. HELLOOO!! I know to some people this may sound awful, but in reality it is a terrific party for your taste buds. My husband had his usual pizza which consists of a bunch of meats and it too was extraordinary. Our waitress was kind and the food came out quickly which I find terribly important for us business people allotted the 1 hour lunch. 
Parking is a little iffy and there is currently road construction in that area as of 11/21/16."}
{"text":"I've managed to eat at Pizza Peel twice...in one week.  Normally I don't repeat dinner places so quickly, but when a pizza craving calls, you MUST answer.

Pairing a pizza with a salad is the way to go for me.  The Peel Salad is really delicious, and the dressing is light but adds a nice zing to it.  Their individual pizza crust is crispy.  You know a pizza place has their stuff together when the center of the pizza isn't soggy.  The people next to me got some wings that looked really good, too.  Beer and wine selection was great and just what you would expect from a local pizza place.

I did a make-your-own the first time...I can't complain, it was good and just the way I wanted it.  The real winner was the Sorry for Partying Supreme.  I'm Sorry for Trying this Pizza, because now I'm going to be coming back and ordering it more often.

Thanks, Pizza Peel.  You're comfort food is so good that I might have to go get a gym membership and actually use it."}
{"text":"The pizza here was so delicious and it was quick to come out!! The waiter we had was so friendly and the hostess was even more amazing! He even flagged our car down when we forgot our left overs! Highly recommend for a casual night out in town :)"}
{"text":"The pizza was great and the bartenders were awesome! I accidentally knocked over a beer, and they were great about it. I recommend for a casual date night!"}
{"text":"We live close to this Pizza Peel so it's convenient to go but after the last few times, we aren't coming back.  The pizza is okay, but highly over priced.  For 2 personal pizzas (8inch) and 1 beer it was 30 dollars.  It's not the pizza that gained this 2 star review it's the service.  The female servers are horrible, slow and rude.  We used to get one of the men servers and he was always on top of it and was super friendly but the female servers are terrible. This last time we went in I tried ordering a beer that the waitress said \"oh I've not heard of that before, no one ever orders that\" then to return 10 minutes later to tell me they were out of it (thought no one ordered it?!) so I ordered another similar style beer and she said she didn't think they had that either but instead of just walking over and asking she decided to yell from our table to the bartender \"Hey we don't have ___insert beer here___ do we?!\" and the bartender said no.  The whole place stopped and looked over, very embarrassing.  So then she told us we couldn't order anything but pizza and beer, (which we wanted wings) she never explained why not.  After we paid and left I wrote to them on fb in a private message and luckily the owner was very nice and offered us a free meal and explained why they weren't serving anything but pizzas (they had the fry cook leave for the night) If we ever decide to use the free meal we will just go to the one in Plaza Midwood, but there are better pizza places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Delish! Ordered the regular house salad and added marinated mushrooms on top! Ordered the Thai pizza and she ordered the veggie one - great meal and price! Will go back!"}
{"text":"I'll give them the ol' head nod in regards to their beer selection.  In terms of the pizza, I've tried a couple and I'm just not a fan.  Their red sauce is a little too sweet for me personally but I'm sure there will be others that love it. 

The interiors are pretty nice and cozy and I really like the patio layout.  The service we encountered was nice and friendly and seemed to be hitting on all cylinders.  The only other drawback may very well be the parking.  It's a tight lot and likely you'll need to find a place along Thomas Ave for parking."}
{"text":"I can't really write a full review of this place yet, but I can say that we had their \"Peel Ribs\" at Taste of Charlotte, and they were out of this world.  I mean seriously, walking down Tryon St. through a crowd with sauce all over your hand and a glazed look in your eyes out of this world.  I'm still in a dreamy rib fog thinking about them.  Will definitely be heading in here for a full review soon."}
{"text":"Specials, specials. I love a good local place with drink or food specials during the week. Even more if they have one on the weekend. 

Experiece here was great. Looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, but surprisingly a little larger in the interior.  

My favorite part were the beer on tap special. They had a new pumpkin ale for like $3, great price and tasty. I has the nachos and my husband had a pizza. Pizza was standard, no chain pizza. No thick crust,  enough sauce and cheese ratio. I will say it was small, not enough for sharing in my opinion. Now my nachos, and I mean nachos with beef, sour cream, cheese, salsa, jalepenos, etc. Was amaxing. Everything came in the side corner so you could add more or as little as you liked. I loved it! 

Lastly I can't not talk abt service.  Our waitress was speedy and attentive. She knew we needed to get out quickly so she multi-tasked greatly."}
{"text":"Trivia night is every Wednesday. Me and a few friends went a couple weeks ago and we had a blast. The servers there are very nice and refreshing. I do plan on going back and trying more foods on the menu, but the pizza is good."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place. I felt like I was a piece of wood caught in a money machine (in the way). It is very unlikely I will return."}
{"text":"We were headed to a restaurant next door but couldn't find parking. There was one space available but it said parking for Pizza Peel only so we decided to give it a shot.  I'm so glad we did.  
After 3 visits, we have not one negative comment.
We found all of the staff to be nice and helpful.
There is a wide variety of craft beers that go so well with the pizza.  You will find pizzas with traditional toppings but also some unusual ones too.  Example on New Years day, they had a special pizza that contained barbeque, black eyed peas, etc. to cover the traditional Southern New Years menu.  If that's not your thing they have pepperoni, sausage, pineapple, etc.
My personal favorite is the Thai pizza.

Try a flight of beers to decide which you like."}
{"text":"Food was great and the pie was worth it.... had the Updyke & Tong's Thai are great pies to try and the garlic knots were a must try and can say they were amazing!"}
{"text":"Pizza peel is great place for traditional pizza.  There are not as many options as places like wolfman pizza, but the crust is far better in my opinion, which makes it worth it. My favorite is the chopped side salad. The tomato vinaigrette dressing is awesome! Never eaten in, but seems like it be a nice place."}
{"text":"This was our third visit here to one of the best  pizza around...........But this Sunday something changed. We can in for lunch and a pizza and salad while incurring one problem....no service. After immediately being seated, no one came to take our order. I tried twice to flag down the only two wait staff and both responded with \"someone with be with you shortly\" After 16 minutes, we left. Wasn't that busy either....strange"}
{"text":"Love me some Pizza Peek! I usually come for pizza, but today I got a wrap! I learned that you can get any of the salads as a wrap. I got the Fiesta Salad as a wrap and it was delicious! The service is fantastic, the beer options are insane, and you can't go wrong with any of their pizzas. Do yourself a favor and visit this place in Plaza Midwood!"}
{"text":"With one of best tap lineups in Charlotte (more than 30 taps and a deep selection of bottles), the Pizza Peel is a beer lover's paradise. The focus is on local brews, but you'll also find a great selection from around the Southeast and other regions of the country. And the servers are knowledgeable enough to help steer you to the perfect beer to quench your thirst. 

The food is nothing to get excited about, but enough to keep you coming back. The Peel serves up a solid selection of decent pizzas, along with an all-you-can-eat lunch buffet that's a great value for the dollar. The pasta dishes are also tasty, particularly the lasagna, which is enough of meal for two people. The restaurant is kid-friendly, and service is always solid. Worth a visit, particularly if you love good craft beer."}
{"text":"If you know me, you know much I love Pizza. However, Pizza Peel did not appeal to me. Probably because I'm more of a thin-crust-lover?! 
I had Tong's Thai Pizza twice and I didn't fall in love with the crust. Very interesting toppings, but not the crust. Anyhow, I was at Pizza peel every Thursday, this past  summer, for bocce, cold ones, and all-around good times.

{"text":"Great gluten free pizza. Especially if you like thin crust. If you are not allergic, ask them to cook it off the pan to make it crispy."}
{"text":"Pizza was supposed to come topped with arugula tossed in balsamic vinaigrette ....  that didn't happen."}
{"text":"Ordered the Greek Pizza with no cheese via a delivery service. I get the pizza and what do I see? No Cheese, which is good, but also no other toppings. The pizza was literally just the cooked dough with some red sauce. I am baffled as to why they would think that because I didn't want Cheese that I would also not want any of the other toppings that came with the specialty pizza. Will not order from there again."}
{"text":"The have great wings and a good beer selections, heavy on the Carolina beers. Try the terruffalo (teriyaki / hot) wings - good combination of sweetness and spice. 

The pizza is not to my taste, the crusts are too thick and not crisp enough.

Service is also very good - friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I received the worst service ever tonight and it may have been a bad night for them. Even though there was a game on we received no service, the waitress took out order and never returned I to ask for the check from the ambivalent host and go to the bar to pick up a carry out box. The food was good and I thought this could be a place I would bring my family but I was wrong."}
{"text":"Ordered the Roasted Veggie and the One Veggie. Both were pretty good although the crust was a bit over baked and a little too thick. The garlic knots are nothing to rave about, but the House Chips I really liked--smoky with a slight kick. Good alternative to Dominos, so we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I enjoy the fact that each Pizza Peel I've been to has been a great, gay-friendly experience.  I mean obviously it's in Plaza-Midwood so it's gay-friendly by default, but in addition to that, the staff has been great.  As far as the food, the pizza is decent.  The One Veggie is my favorite although I think then flavor of their is a bit too sweet.  Either way, this a must try pizza place, then walk a block or two around the corner to a bar or grab some ice cream and make it a nice evening."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Pizza Peel....have not had a bad item yet from the menu.  We always get takeout - excellent system shoots you an email and lets you know when it will be ready for pickup.  Thank you, love it!"}
{"text":"Very rustic look on the inside. Somewhat small dining room. Small menu but it is damn good! The chicken curry egg rolls are the best I've had anywhere. A few types of special pie our favorite is the tong Thai a spicy sweet chicken pizza. I get the supreme a lot which is very respectable. The beer menu is very good with a large local flavor. A great place for every type."}
{"text":"Great pizza and fun ambiance! I'm not from the area but we stopped by from a road trip (starving!) and we were pleasantly surprise with the service and quality of the pizza. I can see myself going there often (again, if I was from the area)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are starting to become regulars it's so good.. My always get the Updyke pizza, small is enough to feed 2-3 people. We also get the mushroom and chorizo pasta. Soooo good! Great place for craft beer as well.

Check out the website for nights when they have a killer band and even trivia night!"}
{"text":"The family went there last night and it was very busy as usual for a Friday night.  The wait was about 25 mins.  We have been to Pizza Peel several times and usually order pizza but only got subs this time.  We had 2 chicken parmesan and one Philly cheese steak sub.  The subs were ok but nothing special.  The chicken parmesan subs lacked tomato sauce.  It was just a few slices of chicken breast with a little cheese on top. The best part was the sub roll.  Next time we will stick with the pizza."}
{"text":"This place has really good pizza, wings, and beer. I'm not that big on beer. But the wife loves their beer offerings. The pizza is always fresh and the flavors are great. But my favorite are the wings. The chili lime wings are probably my best. The staff is always nice. The place is laid back and not stuffy. This is a great place for a small group to hang out on the weekend."}
{"text":"If your name has the word \"Pizza\" in its name,  your pizza should be at least good. My wife and I went for lunch on a lazy Saturday and ordered their Supreme pie, a geek salad and a humus app. The highlight was the raw veggies and salad. The pizza was a distant third. The pizza hard very little sauce and it was bland. The supreme was not so supreme and the crust was overcooked bordering on burnt. Very disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot! I've been in lots for lunch, dinner, drinks... It's just a few minutes from my house and an easy place to land when we get a spur of the moment urge to go out. Their wings are great. Beer selection is really great. My boyfriend loves their nachos. My favorite is the roasted veggie pizza. This location (Cotswold) is really family friendly."}
{"text":"SCORE! I have been to the Pizza Peel twice now, both times for the lunch buffet. Each time there I was greeted by a friendly face, waited on quickly, and enjoyed some awesome salad and pizza. The atmosphere is pretty chill, the staff is very friendly, and the pizza is fresh. They have a wide selection of pizzas to try. I was impressed with the variety they present you with at the buffet. I think my favorite so far is the buffalo chicken pizza! If you get it, I suggest asking for a side of blue cheese to dip it in (YUM).  I noticed the bar had a good number of different beers on tap; I will have to come back and enjoy a cold one on their patio! Overall, good food at a good price with a friendly staff to serve it all up!"}
{"text":"I Love The Pizza Peel! This was my third or fourth time visiting the Central Ave location. It's about a 20-minute drive for me. 

The Pizza Peel uses top quality ingredients and that's just the start! Honestly, pizza should be its own food group! The staff here is friendly and attentive to everyone.This place is both family and dog-friendly. Dogs are allowed outside. Not sure about the inside. There are several events hosted each month. Everything from Music Bingo to a Crawfish Boil (which I attended). This business is very active in the community. 

The menu offers a variety of options all reasonably priced. 

My husband and I love the El Blanco Pizza! Come with a three cheese sauce, mozzarella cheese, sliced tomato, and fresh basil. We add extra cheese and sausage. SO DELISH!!!

I look forward to coming here more often, I love the food and atmosphere. Also, the events are fun!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Local beer list is awesome. Nachos were delish, spouse and toddler loved the garlic knot bread sticks. The sauce here rules...it tastes fresh. Both the nachos and the pizza we selected had chorizo on board. Glad to have a good beer bar and food spot locally for when I visit."}
{"text":"Checked out this joint a few weeks ago while I was moving into my new condo (conveniently located very very near by) and in spite of being yet ANOTHER pizza joint, I found I enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.    

The place is owned and ran by the same folks that own/run the local mama fu's.   Many of the wait staff have been at this location since it was a Mellow Mushroom, which means they know TONS of the locals.   This particular night was jam packed with folks, but my guest and I only had to wait 5 or 6 minutes to be seated.  The service was great and made us feel right at home (though them asking people to vote for them could have something to do with it)

The beer selection is awesome and I was very pleased they had Blue Moon on tap and they include huge orange wedges with their blue moon----YAY!

I ordered one of the smaller person pizzas with pesto and it was good.  Not the best pizza I have had in Charlotte (I reserve that title to Tony's) but was good nonetheless. 

I will be returning to this place often if not only for the convenience and the beer selection."}
{"text":"I've been on a beer kick lately and looking for places that serve craft beers on tap.  I knew about this place for years but had never been here.

The place is small with booths along the right side and tables in the middle and a 10-seater bar in the back.  There are 2 TVs above the bar and 2 on the opposite wall.   The lighting is interesting there's a metal rack above you with decorative light bulbs spaced ever few inches or so.  Neat idea.  

There are plenty of local and regional beers on tap and a few other craft beers as well as Guinness, Stella and PBR.  

The menu is simple with pizzas, sandwiches, salads and apps.  The pizzas sounded amazing but I noticed many of them came with a thai chili sauce instead of tomato sauce.  Interesting twist.  But I opted for the Chicken Philly sandwich.  It arrived and it appeared somewhat healthy.  The peppers were lightly cooked and crunchy.  They seemed like they were steamed along with the onions.  The chicken was tender but not a lot of flavor there and the cheese was smothered over the top.  The sandwich came with wonderful homemade potato chips and a pickle spear.  I could have eaten another batch of the chips.

Prices are decent.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  Definitely a place to come back to.  I just wish i had more options on my rating.  I don't think my visit was worth a 4 but it was higher than a 3.  So this a 3 1/2 rating."}
{"text":"First timers! It was awesome. It was Easter Sunday... so maybe it was slower than it normally is when it's this nice out... but either way we will be back! Very quick service and great pizza! We ordered the bruschetta appetizer (it's called something other than \"bruschetta\" on the menu) and it was delicious! We ordered two small pizzas - the buffalo chicken and a BYO with pepperoni and green peppers. Both excellent! Our server was very attentive and sweet. Also, hey have a big beer selection!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I actually went here for lunch one day & had the small sausage and onion pizza.  It was great.  The crust was a little different than what I like at my normal pizza spot, but still good and crispy.  I think they said it was a wheat crust.

My pizza was perfectly sauced, cheesed & covered.  I enjoyed a really good beer from their really good selection.  I love that they have CCC Amber as that's one of my favorites.  It went great with pizza.

The bartender was a nice guy & kept checking back with me & even found the tennis channel for me to watch!

I went back the next time with my sweetied & eh, not such a great experience.  The bartendress was a bit mmm... flaky.  She couldn't seem to remember what we told her.  

She also really chatted up this great sounding mushroom soup.  I got it to go since I just wanted to taste it before our pizza & then eat it the next day for lunch.  Well I got the soup, opened it up tasted it, & it was Tomato Basil with goat cheese & basil strips - you know it's a let down when you think you're going to taste one thing & then it's something else.  I almost sent it back, but it actually warmed up pretty good the next night for dinner,.

We got the same sausage & onion pizza, but large this time.  It wasn't that great.  Not enough sauce, not enough cheese, not enough toppings.  It's like they use the same amounts for both sizes, so it doesn't work as well on the larger one.

Sweetie wasn't happy.  I won't be back there with him.  I guess for me, it's good for the late lunch.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"We came on Labor Day and sat in the outside area. The service was good. Beer selection was great! Peel pepperoni Pizza was delicious! And the atmosphere was awesome. Loved that they allow dogs in the outside area. Will definitely be back to hang out on a Friday or Saturday night to check out the beer, food, and ambiance again."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I tried the Pizza Peel on a Saturday afternoon while out shopping, and it was such a pleasant surprise! We shared a salad, then I had a chicken philly and he had the pizza that was on special. Everything tasted fresh and came out piping hot! I'm particular about my chicken philly's, and this one was one of the best ones I've ever had. I also had sweet potato fries with honey mustard, which is one of my favorite sides. They were delicious! We have no complaints about the food at all. Our service was a little slow, but the restaurant itself was slow at the time we went so we weren't surprised about that. The inside is rustic/modern, clean, and has a nice bar with local beers on tap. The outdoor seating area was nice as well."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with some guys from work.  Overall I thought the place was great.  Small but nice and cozy interior.  Rustic and comfortable.  Lots of beer on tap, though we didn't have any.  Not too busy early at lunch but business was picking up as we left.

Service was good.  Attentive server, friendly and nice.  Manager swung by to check on us.  That was nice.

Some in the party had the pizza buffet.  All were happy with it.  We asked for a special pizza and they made it right away and it was on the buffet.  Salads were good.  I had a chopped salad and thought it was excellent.

Great value for a quick lunch.  I would go back given the chance."}
{"text":"I was recently invited to try The Pizza Peel and Tap Room on Colwick Road near Cotswold. The Pizza Peel turns out custom and specialty pizzas, pastas, sandwiches and salads and boasts an impressive beer menu. I like that pizzas are available in personal size portions and you can make even a personal size half and half - fun! There is also a Secret Menu. Ask for it.

I tried the \"No Apologies Pizza\" from the Secret Menu which has chipotle hot tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, goat cheese, roasted red peppers, chorizo sausage, spinach, red onion and whole roasted garlic - whew, that was one fully loaded and tasty pizza! The Roasted Veggie (available on the regular menu) was also very good. The dough on both pizzas tasted fresh and well cooked. I also really enjoyed the curry rolls: although not what you might expect at a pizza place, the fried curry spring rolls with chicken, carrots, onions and cabbage got my taste buds going and offered an excellent start to the meal. Other starters include garlic knots, bruschetta, nachos and even house made potato chips. The house salad I sampled was also top-notch and other salads are available as well. I love salads with fruit, nuts and cheese and this house salad fit that bill with cranberries, bleu cheese and walnuts - yum! Pastas like beer & four cheese lasagna and eggplant parm are on my list to try another time and the fish tacos have received accolades as well. The Pizza Peel definitely offers a diverse menu with something for everyone. Every week there are lunch specials and every day there are events like trivia, live music and pint night."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! Service was fantastic!
Roger and Jill are jems! Can't wait to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Was going to do take-out...decided to sit down for pizza and wings..Marinara sauce was delicious...Jacque the waitress was awesome...kid-friendly spot"}
{"text":"Went for the Monday night FREE yoga. Pro tip: arrive early because it will be packed and you don't want to be *that* person who makes everyone shift their mat. So much fun to be doing yoga in the middle of bustling Plaza Midwood while overhearing a debate about Smart TVs over pizza beside you. Plus you get 10% off your bill if you do the yoga and they have $3 local pints on Mondays! To all of the people who left after smelling pizza for an hour, how? how did you do it? I need willpower like that. 

Snagged a table inside with some friends. Nice decor. Service was a little slow, but I think our server was new. No big deal as we were in no hurry. I had the positive friction and oh man it was delicious. I thought $8.95 for an 8\" pizza was pretty reasonable too. A lot of their other menu items looked good too, but I felt obligated to go with a pizza my first time there. Defintely want to try the marinated feta, tacos and the fiesta salad. Guess I'll be doing some more yoga in the near future."}
{"text":"Dropped by The Pizza Peel last night for a second visit, and while the staff wasn't quite as friendly as they were the first time around, they were quite good.  I think it was because they were busier this time.

The food, however, was probably better - we tried the house-made chips as an appetizer (much better than the curry rolls, which were good, but they didn't fit as well with the theme) and the pizza of the day, which was a different variety than the spicy ones we had last time, but still quite tasty.

My stomach wasn't feeling good, so I laid off the alcohol, but this gave me a chance to try their sweet tea.  Very nice, and most excellently sweet.  Big thumbs up.

No one showed up for the January Yelp Gathering, but I can't blame that on The Peel..."}
{"text":"I hate giving this reviews because I see all the great reviews on here but I have to do it. I came here a few nights ago with my husband. We walked in and waited at the hostess stand and no one came by. No one told us they would be right with us or nothing. We waited and waited. Finally a few other couples were walking in after us and asking if we've even been helped yet. Nope. We finally had someone come up to us and all she said was \"How many?\" We told her two and she sat us and walked away. 

We didn't get greeted for a few mins. Our server was super sweet BUT had 7 other tables so she was doing the best she can but it was like pulling teeth. We ordered the chicken rolls and a salad and two small pizzas. The two couples that were behind us, got sat after us. For some reason, they got their pizzas before us and we haven't even gotten our appetizer or salad yet! There was no one to stop and ask about them because everyone was so weeded. Finally, our pizzas came. Ok, where is our appetizer and salad? We asked the food runner about it. She tries to take the pizza back. I stopped her and just asked her to leave it because there is no point. She finally gets us our appetizer and salad and says that they were just sitting there. Gee, ok. 

The chicken rolls were ok but not great. They are definitely not worth $5 for two rolls that are the size of egg rolls. The pizza was also ok but very dry. I asked for extra sauce on my pizza and I didn't get it. When our server finally came around I asked her for a small cup of pizza sauce. She said she will get it. It took her FOREVER to get it. We waited almost 7 mins for it. Finally, my husband just went to the pizza bar area and asked someone for it. 

Not worth it."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing beer collection!!"}
{"text":"Pizza and Beer need I say more?

I'll be honest when i pulled up to the Pizza Peel I wasn't quite sure what to expect. It was a little dificult to get to and the outside didnt knock me down with a come on IN feeling. But once i pulled on the \"pizza peel\" door handles it was like seeing a whole new world. Rustic wood beams and a huge bar with a TON of different types of beer on tap almost made me do a 2nd glance to see if i had stepped in to the twilight zone. 

The server sat me and my wife down went over the lunch specials and asked if we had ever been here before. We explained we were new and he went on to tell us about the pizza dough (something about having molasses? maybe) and about all the diffrent types of beer on tap. 

We ordered a half bbq chicken, half sausage pizza. Fricking awesome. I washed it down with some imported beer that leaves a fruit after taste i couldn't remember what its called but now that i joined their \"beer club\" they said they would keep track of all the beers ive tried.  Needless to say I loved it.  also this might sound gross but i dipped my pizza crust in my that imported beer. It was like my taste buds were in heaven just a little fyi tip."}
{"text":"The pizza would get a 4; the service a 3. We had the buffalo chicken and our friend got the make your own w/ red sauce, cheese and bacon. 8 inches is enough for one hungry person or two to share. The patio is awesome, there were a bunch of littles running around and screaming. We were able to park in their lot on a Saturday night, which was a surprise. Would I eat there again? Maybe."}
{"text":"Decent pizza at under $10 for a non-custom individual sized pizza. Good choices on the menu but I opted for the wrong thing, the Aguascalientes. It includes spicy chili sauce, tomatillos, chorizo, mozzarella cheese, cheddar cheese, red onions, roasted corn and black bean salsa, and there was little of any of these except for the cheese. Not much chorizo or the corn and black bean salsa so the flavors didn't come out as I hoped. The thin crust is fine but toppings should compensate.

Seating outdoors is always fun and of course lots of people-watching available on this corner lot."}
{"text":"My family and I were truly excited when this place was finished a year ago, and in that time it has become one of our regular haunts. We have never been disappointed with anything on the menu, but our favorites are their amazing bruschetta with crostini, phenomenal Greek pizza, and the chopped salad with cloves of roasted garlic. Great beer selection with a good list of North Carolina brews. When the weather is nice it is the best with plenty to keep my son occupied for a relaxing afternoon. Disc golf goal, corn hole boards, and a popsicle stand. Their staff always takes care of us, and the managers are very personable giving it that comforting mom and pop feel! All in all I highly recommend pizza peel!"}
{"text":"This is another one of those places that I've had a review drafted for quite some time, but haven't pulled the trigger as of yet. So, Pizza Peel. The pizza is quite tasty and it's a quaint little spot for a casual lunch or dinner. As Todd W mentioned, we noticed that a) it's pretty dark in there (even during midday) and b) their beer list is almost unparalleled in Charlotte. Nice start!

Staff was pretty friendly, albeit we didn't need too much attention during a late lunch. While they do have a $7.50 pizza lunch buffet Mon-Fri, 11-2, I went with the small (8\") Red & White Pizza. This delicious 'za included ricotta, mozzarella, bruschetta and sun-dried tomatoes. It was well cooked but a bit heavy on the sun-dried tomatoes. I can only handle so much! Plenty of cheese though! I had a slice or two to bring home for leftovers and I exited happy & full. 

And due to Leanne C's nerdy, but correct, engineering & math skillz, I now recall the reason why the 16\" pie costs more than twice than the 8\" pie. You see, folks, using the formula A=pi*rsquared. Yes, that's pi * the radius squared, an 8\" pie has an edible area of 50.24 sq. inches and the 16\" pie has an edible area of 200.96 sq inches. Therefore it *does* make sense that their 16\" pie costs more than double their 8\" pie. Although...you typically don't see this on menus due to extremely high economies of scale at pizza joints. Anywho. That is all."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pizza!!! Best I have found since moving to Charlotte from Boston. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"I love Plaza Midwood. And now, there's one more reason to love this 'hood even more.

I've been a big fan of the original Peel in Cotswold for years. Confession: I use to order $40 worth of food so Foodie Call would deliver to me. So, yeah I've been pumped and counting the days for this new location to open.

My hands down favorite pizza here: Thai's Tong. Chicken, Thai sweet chili sauce, basil, onions, red pepper. The sauce just makes this pizza pop. Yum. In 92 pt font. First runner up: the buffalo chicken. Nachos are great. Bruschetta is addicting. Once I start eating it... I can't seem to stop.

The inside looks amazing. Walls are wood. They brought in an old piano from The Common Market in South End. Peel plans to bring in someone who can play it. What else can you expect? Music trivia nights, a ton of great beer. All of the beer. The GM knows more about beer than any other person I know. 

One thing though bums me out: the location does not have my favorite menu item. Sad face. I love the curry rolls at the Cotswold location. I dream about them sometimes. They take awhile to make, so currently they can't handle both locations. My fingers are crossed that this somehow changes in the future.

Congratulations on Peel #2. This city is a better place with not one, but two of you."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick pizza fix at lunch. Solid combo offering for reasonable rate. It is a buffet for the lunch combo so sometimes the choice is a bit light.
Solid beer selection on draft. Family friendly too as I have had no issues brining in the young kids."}
{"text":"I've been to the Pizza Peel twice so far and I've never made it past the patio. It's just too darn inviting and we always end up there. Maybe when it gets chilly we will head inside, or just sit really close to a heater... 

The best thing about this place is that they have a GIGANTIC beer selection. I think we went on a Monday once and they were having a Beer Poker for a really cheap price. It was like Beer Roulette to me, you didn't get to pick the beer, it was just a surprise and you drank whatever they brought you. Good way to try new stuff though so we tried it, and it was fun. We also learned what will cause bitter beer face and what to stay away from next time. LOL

The food here is decent, but it's not my fave. I'm not a huge pizza gal either though so perhaps that's why. But I tried the garlic knots thinking they'd be amazing, and they just turned out to be a greasey pile that made my stomach upset after eating 2 of them. The next time I went I had a salad of some sort that was on their special board and it was pretty great, and spicy. 

It's a great place to be a regular and it's close to home so I'd def say to give it a go."}
{"text":"Been here two other times and it was fine however today was a disaster, got pizza buffet all the pizzas were old and dry then when I asked about fresh pizza and they finally put up there was not good, not much cheese at all just like what's going on with this place?! Well I won't wast my money again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday as we checked out our new area. Great music & beer selection. Had the bruschetta and 8\" pizza, everything was delicious. Look forward to going back - may try yoga too."}
{"text":"I have to revise my previous review.  We stopped in last night to give pizza peel another go and had a great meal! We even re-ordered the same pizzas!"}
{"text":"After trying this establishment it suffices to say that the beer offerings are superior to the pizza. The pizza is okay but nothing spectacular. The sauce is relatively bland and they were quite stingy on the toppings. The crust was pretty good. I have been in Charlotte for a month now and it seems like bland food is par for the course across the restaurant spectrum. I am from New Orleans and this is what we affectionately refer to as Yankee pizza. Not bad but definitely no Mardi Gras for the taste buds. The beer selection and the fact that I live around the corner will bring me back. The pizza is better than the big chains but that is where the superiority ends."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was pretty disappointed by my first  experience here. I had high hopes for this restaurant because I knew they offered gluten-free options. I dined in with my family as well as some another family. For starters we had to ask for some of the chairs to be cleaned off before we could sit. The hostess brought all the kids kid's menus but no crayons to do the activities. 
I ordered a gluten-free pizza for my son and a regular pizza for myself. In both cases we substituted goat cheese for the traditional mozzarella.  I was fine with the upcharges for the cheese as well as the gluten free crust. There was no gluten free price option noted on the menu and the waiter didn't even know what it was.  But what was most disappointing was when the pizzas came out. The toppings were so skimpy and the taste was pretty flavorless. If I am paying more for toppings (especially premium ones) I expect to get a generous portion. 

My friend ordered a bbq pizza and the bbq sauce was literally drizzled on the pizza. She asked for some extra sauce.  When her bill came there was a 50 cents upcharge. The manager did remove it after she complained.  

Overall I was extremely disappointed and am pretty sure that I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Not just a pizza place but a great variety of food to choose from. Lots of parking close by if their lot is full. It's in a great little area with cute shops as well. They have daily specials that are always a fave. This is my tenth time eating here and I always enjoy it."}
{"text":"Wow, glad we stumbled upon these guys

First off, parking is around the back, not on central ave

The atmosphere here is great! Nice mood lighting, good reggae music playing tonight, comfortable seating, and lots of Windows

They have a pretty long beer list, and offer various flights based in your taste, our you can create a custom flight for $8. The flights come with 4 mini glasses

We ordered two 8inch pizzas, the dyk with pesto and the veggie with red sauce

The pizzas came with whole wheat crust to our delighted surprise, and were two of the best pizzas we've ever had

Also got the sweet po fries. Delicious.


Service was friendly and pro 

Good job Andrea

Thank you for a great dinner ^.^"}
{"text":"Great service...food could be better. Got nachos and a Greek pizza (gluten free crust). It wasn't bad....but I've had better. I did appreciate the chorizo on the nachos (better than just chili) but the chips were mediocre and all in all, so was the pizza. That could be because I got gluten free crust (trying it out). The service was great though, and that alone will take me back to try a few more things in the menu :)"}
{"text":"We've been to Pizza Peel a few times, and while pizza isn't my favorite thing to have for dinner, I REALLY like Pizza Peel.   For starters, they are in a great location in Plaza Midwood.  The interior is spacious, with several TVs for sports fans.  They also have long picnic tables for seating outside.  

We always start with their amazing curry chicken rolls that are deliciously crispy and a little bit spicy.  For our entrees, my husband likes the Heart Stopper Pizza, with ham, sausage, pepperoni, beef, and bacon.  I like making my own, with a pesto base, artichokes, and basil or arugula.  

Their crust is a wheat/white crust, veering a little more on the wheat end.  I've never tried wheat crust before, and theirs is absolutely delicious.  It's thin, crispy, a teeny bit sweet, and the bottom stays dry.  It s hard to describe the taste, but it's uniquely different in a good way.

We'll keep returning!"}
{"text":"Day after Thanksgiving and the place was rocking..  Very good food and Lindsay was an excellent server..  prompt, friendly, knowledgeable and professional.

Buffet stayed stocked and pizza was hot..  super buffet value including salad and drink for $10..  will be back....."}
{"text":"My official rating is .5 stars. The pizza is just awful. It's the proverbial \"it tastes like cardboard\". I really can't believe how anyone can possibly say a good thing about the pizza at PP. This was my second experience, the first one was at the Cotswold location so I wanted to give PP one more try at a different location. As my buddy stated, they actually accomplished an amazing feat, the pizza was soggy but managed to taste like cardboard at the same time. Never ever going back to a PP, it's not a 0 rating only because I like the location."}
{"text":"Nice spot for higher grade pizza buffet, compared to CiCi's. The decor was great but other than that this place is just average. Pizza was good but not the best I've had. Buffet was lacking variety. I'll definitely go back to get a better idea of this place."}
{"text":"I love this pizza so much! I love the lunch buffet.  The crust is chewy and delightful, always a little well done-which I enjoy. If you want a lighter crust, you must ask!!  All toppings are of high quality. I love the eggplant parm! Perfect to warm you up on a cool day. Expensive prices, but worth it."}
{"text":"Great pizza. The service was good, I usually go to Cotswold, although this location is really busy and a lot of people if you like to mingle.  The service here is much faster. One of my favorite pizzas and eggplant parm around."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with this place always fantastic pizza and good appetizers as well. They always have good local beers on tap cool Eclectico vibe and usually not too packed. It's located perfectly in Plaza midwood. Close walk to your next spot after dinner or if you want to stay and have drinks with a group of friends it's a great location. Go here when you're in Plaza Midwood and definitely if you're in the mood for pizza and a good beer"}
{"text":"Unless you have children or a reservation (actually, don't make one, just come another night), stay far away on Friday nights 'till after 9. It's a mobscene, kids everywhere, and the service suffers.

Had a chance to check the bruschetta out (since something happened to our pizza orders) and it was the best appetizer I've had here, period. Still, the pizza's where these guys excel, even tho they'e beginning to suffer from that crust-space-enlargement disease so common in pizzerias these days. Seriously, on an 8 inch pie, a 2 inch wide crust is insulting."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday afternoon (with a baby) and were seated immediately.  My friends kept talking about how strange it was that the 16\" was more than double the cost of the 8\" pizza. Remembering elementary math, you actually get 4 times as much pizza with the larger option.  I got the Buffalo  Chicken Pizza and it was really tasty.  The fried dough is amazing.  It is a HUGE bowl filled with bite sized pieces of funnel cake, topped with powdered sugar and strawberry sauce.  Be brave, get dessert (it is worth it!!!!)."}
{"text":"Tucked behind the corner, it's a difficult place to stumble upon randomly, but it is a great place to which to venture for pizza and beer. 

They have a wonderful selection of craft beers on tap -- many of which are local -- and their pizzas are awesome! I had their jambalaya pizza and it was perfect!

My only complaint is that the place gets EXTREMELY hot. The ceiling fans really do nothing but circulate the hot air that fills the dining area from their open kitchen. No one should be sweating at their tables, of whom I saw many patrons doing in addition to myself.

Until the weather cools or if they start cranking up their A/C, I would recommend not coming here during the warmer months."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!   Numerous options for toppings, awesome crust, and you can get a personal 8\" or 16\" to share.  They also have other items such as different appetizers and tacos, next time we will definitely have to try those.  It is also a great location on central ave and a great spot to watch the games."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious, salad was delicious and was able to take home leftovers for lunch. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great selection for their lunch buffet. Salad is very green and tasty. They do it right here. Cheap too!"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about the pizza peel so I wanted to give it a shot. First off, they don't deliver so that's a little frustrating. But in any event, we ordered takeout and went and picked it up. We ordered a buffalo chicken pizza and a pepperoni pizza. That buffalo chicken pizza was a little too spicy for my liking but overall it was pretty good. The issue I have is with the pepperoni pizza we received, it was very over cooked. Now I understand things happen in a restaurant and things aren't perfect every time, but when it comes to take out this is extremely frustrating. Because you don't realize it until after you've returned home and are ready to eat. There should have been some quality control before the pizza was sent out of the kitchen. For me, this just ruins and experience. I personally won't return to pizza peel, there is too many other great pizza restaurants in Charlotte to choose from.  

*** update***

So after my first experience that was subpar at the pizza peel. Management reached out to me and asked for a Second chance. I'm glad I took them up on their offer, the second time around the pizza was much much better and perfectly cooked. I now understand why the pizza peel has had such great reviews from other yelpers. They do offer a great product and their management and ownership is very responsive and thorough! I will continue to return to the pizza Ville and recommend them to others.  Thank you Chris!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the service we received was great. Our waiter was friendly and nice. Other than that, everything was just okay. We ordered a pizza and both weren't crazy about it. The sauce was a little too sweet for my liking and my fella thought they didn't put enough meat on the pizza. Was it totino's pizza bad? No. But we both agreed that next time we go there we will forgo the pizza and try something else."}
{"text":"Pizza Peel is an ideal place for great food and great beer selection.  I love their garlic knots and their chicken curry rolls.  Also, they have a lunch buffet during the week and on Saturdays.  And did I mention .... the customer service here rocks.   :)"}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here and we not impressed. We wanted to give this place a try seeing as how it was new and always packed. We got the nachos, garlic knots and a pepperoni pizza. The pizza was tough and the crust inedible. The garlic knots were doughy and dense. The only thing we actually ate we're the nachos but we had to reheat the cheese because it became very rubbery. 
We had hoped for better from a new place but feel that we can get better pizza from somewhere else for half the money."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  Place has a great atmosphere, greeted with a smile and seated immediately.  

Had the pizza buffet, came with a salad and drink for $8.50.  Very good price for comparison.  Small buffet but 6 different options at the same time.  

Pizza was great, not the best I have had but hey it was buffet style as well.  Salad was surprisingly simple but very tasteful. 

For the  value and quickness I would definitely recommend and come back when in the area.  

If they would have had a desert pizza or some free Andes mints would have gotten 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great for our family.  My girl can be loud and at the PP its not a problem.  We always get the Tai pizza and the bruscetta.  Its the best bruscetta i have ever had.  Very difrent."}
{"text":"Fresh pizza made just the way you like it. Chewy and crispy crust atntye same time, don't know how they do it, but I came to tell you that it's down right good and flavorful."}
{"text":"Since I had Monday off for the holiday I decided to venture out to try the Pizza Peel for lunch. It's a bit of a drive for me, but it was worth it. They have a lunch buffet M-F from 11-2. Buffet is a bit of a stretch. The only have room for 3 maybe 4 pizzas at the most. I got there around 1 pm and there wasn't much of a selection, but they had some pizzas in the oven which came out pretty quickly and after that they did a good job of keeping the pizzas well stocked. The buffet also includes a salad and drink, which is great considering most places charge you upwards of $2 for a drink along with your meal. The salad was mixed greens with tomato and some Cheddar cheese. It was crisp and fresh. Since they don't have much room for pizza they usually do half & half pizzas. I didn't really try to figure out which was which, but it was all good. The only complaint I could make was that on some of the pizzas the center was a bit soggy, but that happens most places when they load the pizza up with toppings, so it wasn't a big deal. The crust was thin NY style with a nice chewy crust. If you want a good, cheap lunch, then stop by the Pizza Peel. Heck if you just want a good pizza stop there.  This was some of the best pizza I've had here in Charlotte. They also had many beers on tap and in the cooler, but by the time I was done stuffing my face with pizza I didn't have much room for beer. That just gives me an excuse to stop back some other time."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place so many times and have been wanting to stop in to see what was so good to have a full house every single time! Finally stopped in on Saturday and unfortunately, wasn't able to figure out the hype. The pizza was great, I mean really good especially for the price point, but the service was atrocious. 

The hostess didn't really ask us if we wanted to sit inside or out, and sat us right in front of the door in a mostly empty dining room. Awkward placement to say the least. It was unclear from there which staff member was going to be waiting on us. Our waitress finally came around and asked what we wanted to drink, but the poor girl was serving tables inside and outside. There seemed to be no rhyme or rhythm to the service in this place. The table next to us had a different waiter who was also running between inside and outside. Consequently we barely saw our waitress and when we did we had to waive her down to get help. 

Advice to management- reconsider your table assignment structures/systems. It doesn't make sense to have a staff member serving two tables inside and two outside because inevitably the service for all four tables suffers as you can't be in two places at once. I don't really fault our waitress for the bad experience this weekend, because I am sure she had tables everywhere because of management. 

Will definitely give them a second chance, but I hope they have the service bit figured out by then."}
{"text":"I would've appreciated if the menu had mentioned all their pizzas are wheat before I had 50 dollars worth of disgustor on our table. Even my wife's sandwich left much to be desired. Over priced and under flavored. Severely disappointing, especially considering the other reviews. At least the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday Panther's Football day and surprisingly not overwhelmingly full. Ordered the bake Ziti and a 3 cheese Florentini, which were both decent. I would have loved more flavor on both sauces and more of that delicious knot bread. Overall good atmosphere, good service and will be back to actually try the pizza."}
{"text":"I have to say, out of all of the pizza places I have had vegan pizza in Charlotte thus far, I enjoy theirs as one of my favorites. It is fresh, if you get the veggie pizza with vegan cheese, it is LOADED with vegetable goodness. The crust is crispy, the cheese is melted to perfection (which with some vegan pizza situations at other places they either don't melt it enough or burn it...) and the personal size is a great size to fill you up. 

The restaurant is super neighborhood friendly. It is easy to slip in and out for a nice casual meal and glass of wine or beer here. The staff members are all laid back, informative if you have questions, but overall they just let you enjoy your meal. The manager/owner occasionally drops by the tables as well. There are some TVs for sports, a bar area, booths and table seating. It is a place we enjoy dropping in and out of when we are feeling lazy, tired and hungry. 

My review simply is pizza related because that is what we drop in for. However, my boyfriend also enjoys the meatballs here! We are Italians so often times are hard on pizza places, but we do keep coming back here so it definitely has goodness to it.

Great neighborhood causal pizza spot!"}
{"text":"Pizza. Social. Convenient. Local. 
 Go for the pizza. Either build your own or get one of their signature pies. The apps are fairly standard - wings, dips, garlic knots - what more do you need when you have a pizza in the oven?!

We got pasta and the Mediterranean app last week and were moderately pleased. After we scarfed down our eggplant parmesan (no cheese for me) out of pure starvation, we both commented on the meal and wished we had gone with the pizza. Bea cause we know it is GOOD. 

Go for the pizza. Stay for the cozy welcoming atmosphere and the draft list. The Cotswold location is tucked away and often not as busy as the Central location!"}
{"text":"Third visit here in a month... we are addicted. This Thursday they had a band playing, they were really good and it was the perfect music for a family friendly place like the peel. Enjoyed listening and would go back to hear again. 
BF had the chicken parm... said the roll it was on super tasty and the chicken was nice and crispy and tender, he would order again.
I decided to try the tomato basil mozz pizza... when it first came out I thought it didnt have enough cheese, I was wrong. The mozz was cut on the thicker side so you got a nice bite of cheese and that good cheese string pull from it.. their sauce is outstanding and is a star on this pizza. The basil, instead of being the traditional leaves was chiffonade which allowed for you to get basil in each bite. 
The owner/manager came by, he has been there each time we have gone and you can tell he loves the business and has a vested interest in ensure his guests have a good experience."}
{"text":"Save your money and go buy a DiGiorno.  The pizza tasted like cardboard. 

It is also very loud and the seating is on top of each other. Also, our table was right underneath the A/C vent so it was freezing to say the least.

We could not wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"My search for good Charlotte pizza continues....

I checked out the Pizza Peel on Central last night. Cool looking spot, great location with lots going on around it, nice vibe, great taps of beer flowing.  But I came here for the pizza.  And sadly, it left me very unimpressed. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  It was decidedly \"meh\".  Completely, totally, \"meh\".  I have no reason to ever come back. I could see grabbing a draft given the nice selection, but if I'm going to eat unhealthily, it had better taste pretty damn good.  And sorry, but this isn't it.  

The search continues..."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try a new place in my neighborhood.  We were greeted by two very bubbly and friendly young ladies at the hostess booth.  They said that they would have our table ready in five minutes.....and they delivered!  The server promptly took our drink order and all was good.
I have to admit.  We are spoiled by the excellent pizza at Asheville Brewing Company, so we hold that as our standard.  The menu here featured self creations and a specialty pizza section.  We decided to go with a predesigned pizza labeled \"Positive Friction.\"  The menu described it as being topped with pesto, feta, sun dried tomatoes, fresh tomatoes and mozzarella.  We found the pizza crust to be dry, the toppings weren't juicy, and the cheese wasn't stringy.  It appeared to have been made in the past, frozen, and popped into the oven.  It didn't taste bad, but it didn't stand out.  We do want to support our neighborhood businesses, so we will stop by again.  Next time, we will design our own pizza to see if it meets our juicy,  stringy expectations.
P.S.  Kudos to Pizza Peel for featuring a nice amount of vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"We were out working yesterday until late evening, and decided to go out to get a bite to eat. We decided to try The Pizza Peel the food, and service was really good. I had the pretzel bun burger with sweet potato waffle fries, and my wife had the nacho platter. We really enjoyed it we would go back."}
{"text":"Our first experience at Pizza Peel (moved to CLT three months ago and still exploring options).  It was OK but we'll continue to search for better.  A definite poiint against the place was established by the manager during our late Saturday afternoon visit: While we waited for our pizza, he held a staff meeting at the counter and proceded to dress down his employess for varous things -- all of it in a loud voice that was clearly audible to the handful of customers in the room at the time.  Not sure I want to patronize a business where management displays such an attitude toward employees."}
{"text":"Such a great place. Pizza is amazing and they have so much beer. Mofos like to drink up there! Saw one dude who got drunk and brought a damn chicken and a 70 dollar block of cheese in the place. 

Overall A+"}
{"text":"I know Pizza Peel is one of the local favorites and I will say that is it a good basic place to go with a group. If you are ever really hungry at lunch time their lunch buffet is a great deal. We usually end up going there because we are hungry and they usually have a decent local beer selection."}
{"text":"Oh Pizza Peel! What can I say??? It is usually quick and easy and they have a solid craft beer selection. 

Last time I was there I tried their lunch buffet for the first time and for my fellow vegetarians this is not a good option for you unless you Love cheese pizza. Also if they are not very busy your pizza choices will be limited. The price is the best thing about the buffet but it was not worth it for me even at $8.99! You can ask them to make something but they may or may not
do it.

Enough about the buffet! I have to say this is not the best pizza in town and is a bit crusty for me but not bad if you are looking for a quick meal with friends. They do have other stuff including a few decent salads. I do think this is a good place for a group and I enjoy their outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood pizza joint. The staff is always so friendly and accommodating!! Craft beer specials on Thursday nights along with live music. Special place!!"}
{"text":"I just love \"The Peel.\" It's a go-to lunch meeting spot with friends and colleagues, especially since I work in the area. Here are a few reasons why it's high on my list:

- Draught beer selection is large and diverse. Lots of craft offerings. Old standbys as well as soon to be favorites from far and wide.
- Pizza. Slam dunk. Every time.
- Salads are dreamy. Well-executed and lacking nothing.
- The pasta dishes are really solid. Sometimes I come in wanting a heavy, carby meal and these don't disappoint.
- The Mr. raves about the wings, buffalo & blue cheese sandwich and fish tacos. I can't speak to those, but he keeps ordering them...so they must be good. I've heard they're the best fish tacos in town. Go try them and let me know!
- Specials. Every day, they're rocking special menu items that run the gamut of flavors. Go out on a limb and order one. 

I especially love the patio, which can be heated for the chilly winter weather. It's also perfect for families...I see families everywhere! Beer for the parents, pizza for kids...what more could you ask for?

All in all, this is a great place to go for pizza and lots of other stuff, too."}
{"text":"I went to pizza peel on 9/8/16 and had pizza and wings. I like the pizza. I've had their pizza before but they really need to get out of the wing game or step it up. I ordered the bbq. The wings are breaded which is fine but if the wings are going to be breaded and then sauced please let the wings have flavor!!! Please let the sauce have flavor!! Please make your wings well done and crispy. No one who orders wings wants tough wings! Charlotte has a few really great wing spots. Take note and do your pings better and get more customers. If you want wings go somewhere else. If you want pizza go here. The pizza is ok."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. I had the Updyke - it is one of the very good fancy\"pinky out\" kinda of pizzas. 
The service was excellent April has a great personality and made excellent recommendations on what to eat. 
I will be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza Peel on Central Avenue in Charlotte serves a good pizza pie! They have a great selection of toppings and the crust has good flavor and good consistency. I also like that you can sit inside or outside. Outside has a nice play area for children. I recommend Pizza Peel."}
{"text":"Loved this place. We went here twice.
Pesto Penne Pasta was A++
Also the Roasted Veggie pizza was excellent.

Not tried any of the other pizzas on the menu so my review could change depending. 

The eggplant pasta was a miss, I would pass. 
Also I noticed a few people raved about their fish tacos, while the fish was very fresh it wasn't as flavorful as I expected. 

Ambience and decor was nice. Can be tough to get a table on weekends. 

Give it a shot, they seem to be one of the better places I've been to for pizza in Charlotte so far."}
{"text":"I have seen restaurants rise and fall.... I've never seen one fall so far.
I've watched this place change several times before settling in as Pizza Peel.
I was here the night it opened and dozens of times since. They had the standard slight deterioration in service and product, but were still a good deal.
I moved to another neighborhood and hadn't been back in a few months.
Thought I'd take the girls tonight as we have an early start. We got there and were able to be seated right away, but were refused the seat we wanted as it was 'reserved'. Wait!? They don't take reservations.....but um?
Even though they had 3-4 servers on the floor and 7 tables seated, it took 6+ minutes for someone to take out drink order. 6 minutes with a hungry 3&7y old. Sheesh!
So once our order was in all went reasonably well... However the quality of their pizza has become sub-par. Maybe a notch above dominos at best, yet still over 20 bucks for a large pie with just pepperoni. 
Won't be coming back....and until they get their act together is steer clear."}
{"text":"We orders 2 pizzas and I picked them up so this is just about the food. The pizzas we had were very good nothing spectacular however if you can do the basics right then I know the rest of the more complicated food items are just as good. I really liked the pizza and I would have it over papa or dominoes. Next time I will be dining in to get the hole experience and they had great beers on tap too but I had to drive so no beer for me. It is tricky to get to with the construction so it right before the Krispy Kreme if your going tires the light and Vice versa."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place based on recommendations from friends.  I must admit they were a little pricier than I thought $21 for 16 inch pizza, with upcharges for certain toppings.  I ordered a vegetarian pizza topped with jalapenos peppers which came at an extra charge and a peel pepperoni with pineapple, which came with lots of pepperoni and $1 extra charge according to their menu.  The lots of pepperoni was a bit of exaggeration.  I guess what turned me off is how they nickel and dime you for extra toppings. They even charged me for a side of balsamic dressing.  I guess given the initial cost I expected the little extras to be free which they weren't or the pizza to be extraordinary, which it wasn't either.  It wasn't bad just ordinary."}
{"text":"Nothing catches my eye like a pizza buffet.  Luck would have it that I'd be in the area recently to give this a try.  Even at $8.50 now, this is quite a deal, as the price includes a drink and a salad.  Really enjoyed my salad with their house honey basil vinaigrette.  Although they only have a few pizzas out at a time and were dealing with a full lunch crowd, they were pretty good about restocking quickly enough that I rarely had to wait.  They had some interesting offerings like both barbecue and buffalo chicken pizzas, a veggie pizza with roasted garlic that was one of my favorites, and the usuals like cheese and a meat lovers.  I did enjoy the pizza, although I'd say I've had better, but that's no knock.  For the price and the quality, the pizza peel makes for an extremely satisfying lunch experience."}
{"text":"Very very good pizza. All I can do is comment on the pizza because if carry out.  The large pizza is big and it can serve 8 big slices, while the small pizza has 4 smaller slices. 

We go the supreme and what I likes the most was the taste of the pizza not being overwhelmed by the sauce.  Great mixture of all toppings.  I would go back even though I think the price might be a bit steep.  Worth the stop if looking for a good family pizza that is way better than the chains !"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Pizza Peel more than half a dozen times in the last two months and I've never been inside. This is my FAVORITE place to \"Postmates\" lunch or dinner. My go-to is the BBQ pizza but their house chips and wings are amazing. My boyfriend loves the Tong's Sweet Chili wings and I really like the pizza that has that sauce too. Maybe one day I'll make it in there but either way, they'll always get my business!"}
{"text":"Why, oh, why was I tempted to try a new pizza spot in Charlotte?  Usually I heed reviews from other yelpers or go with a small bite taste test. Instead, I have a 25$ pie with a slice taken out, currently holding my dining room table to the floor. 

This pizza that is among THE worst tasting pizzas I have ever had. The crust was very dense, and overwhelmingly dry and wheaty. The toppings were too salty, too acidic, and just plain flavorless. Additionally there were fairly minimal as well.

I literally finished a slice. One. Of my $25 pizza. 

This place is a hard pass"}
{"text":"Went for lumch as truly impressed!  The lunch special was great and the service was friendly! The interior was cute too!  I highly recommend thos place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Not too busy on a Sunday night. Got a flight at the bar, and a pizza. Didn't take too long. Pizza was amazing, enjoyed tasting the different beers with a flight."}
