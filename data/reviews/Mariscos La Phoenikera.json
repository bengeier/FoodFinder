{"text":"Waitress was not very friendly and and spoke so soft plus the music was very loud. She seemed to get irritated when we asked her to repeat herself.  My food was cold, fried shrimp was pretty good. Chips and salsa was also very tasty."}
{"text":"This is our place of choice when we are in the area and looking for some good Mexican food. They have all your traditional foods like tacos, sopes, quesadilllas, burritos and mariscos. All at a fairly good price. You can't go wrong here. Plus the staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This is yummy Mexcian food and I've been through here a few times now. Going to give an overview of what you can get, since the options are plentiful.   When the Mercado opens at 10 this place serves breakfast, both American style pancakes and eggs or or make-your-own omelette, plus south of the border tastes -- Tip: if you want traditional go for the Huevos Divorciados (divorced eggs).  Lunch and dinner has your usual selection of burritos, tortas, tostadas, quesadillas, what's interesting is you can al a carte a lot of stuff on the menu and thereby build your own plate of food. Prices fairly good for most things. You could go frugal and get out of here for less than ten bucks or go completely wild and look at a good 20-30 per person. I'm drooling just thinking about this food, seriously.  Lots of seafood options. Campechana, Cocos, Caldos, Shrimp and Fish dishes. This is really their specialty (well duh, Mariscos)  Some big appetizer plates intended for groups, or you can have it as a meal. Start with the $2 steak or chicken tacos. Yeah, they are ALWAYS that price, kudos there. A buck more for the nicer fish tacos. I happen to like the Marlin tacos.   If your Spanish isn't so good you can practice here, though of course English is spoken too.   On the drinks, they have happy hour specials Monday through Thursday from 4-6pm, which includes a variety of beer buckets, Micheladas, and big 32oz bottles on the cheap. I tried one of their Micheladas, it was nice and spicy though no tamarindo straw. They also have a signature drink I'll have to try that next time.. Fancy beer drinks! Oh yeah, and fresh juices (agua frescas) you have the Horchata, Jamaica, sodas etc.   Where to find them: Inside the Food Court of the Mercado de los Cielos building (South East edge of Desert Sky Mall), Mariscos La Phoenikera takes up several of the spaces and has a partially gated central seating area surrounded by TVs and lively decorations."}
{"text":"Worst place the cashier told us to sit down then the waitress came kicking us out because he had people waiting when he had no people waiting when we came. Good thing is that I was visiting from Cal and I will never recommend this place to anyone or ever come here."}
{"text":"Their food is great. But the service is horrible. The older lady that mainly takes the orders is extremely rude. She has no customer service skills at all."}
{"text":"Heck yea I enjoyed this place! Loved oysters! Great job on the service and the chips were good and the salsa needed some salt lol"}
