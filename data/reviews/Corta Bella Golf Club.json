{"text":"A very friendly golf club cafe with a better than average menu and very efficient staff. Multiple TVs let you watch golf ( and other sports) while enjoying choices including  very good quesadillas, flavorful wings, fresh salads and many other well prepared items. The staff, headed by Lisa Sanchez as manager, is well trained, friendly and helpful. It can get noisy when groups come in from a round of golf, but it does not really interfere with enjoying this very nice sports cafe!"}

{"text":"We are members here and eat here often.  The staff is always friendly and the  food (fairly typical of a golf club) is casual but there's a nice variety.   Usually good,  but occasionally there's a misstep."}
