{"text":"Oh Amanda F. why did I not read your review before dinner tonight! Maybe the empty parking lot should have given me a clue, but I thought it meant a fast and quiet dinner for us tonight. I am a regular diner at the Fiesta Jalisco on Independence, and have recently moved closer to the Matthews location. This was my first chance to stop in for dinner, and what a disappointing difference! First, the chips were a little stale, and the salsa was a bit too runny (no solids at all) and way too spicy. We asked for a more mild salsa, and our server provided two additional bowls of the same salsa. My soda taste like it had Pine-Sol in it, and when I asked for another it taste exactly the same. Bummer! When our entrees arrived, it was a major disappointment. My chile relleno came out minus the poblano pepper. It was a slimy pile of cheese and meat. The taste also disappointed, with an odd texture that sort of clung to my mouth like greasy cling wrap. The enchilada was satisfactory, and the taco was good enough, though the large tomato slice on top didn't really seem to belong. Finally, the complimentary sweet at the end of the meal was on a soggy tortilla chip with whipped cream that taste like it might not have been good anymore. My dinner partners were equally disappointed with their meals. Definitely not going to return to this location."}
{"text":"This has GOT to be one of the most authentic Mexican restaurants in all of Matthews.   Seriously, it's NOM NOM NOM good.   We need to venture outside of our normal Carne Asade [truth be told], but why? I love you soo much Mr. Asada!    which I had AGAIN tonight...and the pinto beans that they serve with chips seem to be a second cousin of a slab of bacon, yummy.  You won't be disappointed when you visit Fiesta Jalisco!"}
{"text":"No, no, no and no. Sorry, not for me. Absolutely nothing to make me want to come back. This building has hosted several different restaurants previously. Hopefully the next occupants don't think they can half-ass their way to success. A little effort would be nice people."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for dinner. It was very humid inside with no AC and just a fan blowing in the distance.  No drinks menu, no appetizers. They forgot to bring out the complementary chips and salsa. I asked whether they have margaritas and the waitress didn't know. Few minutes later she brought out a margarita that I didn't order. I tasted it and it tasted like watered down gatorade. No description of the food, just pictures. We ordered something and it was very mediocre, definitely not worth the $17. We waited 1/2 hour for our check and they said the long wait was due to them being \"busy\", when the place was mostly empty with 4 tables. We put cash on the table and left. Probably one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Fiesta Jalisco is the newest of the Downtown Matthews Mexican Triangle.  Two blocks or less from each other there are three Mexican Restaurants!  Today is Tuesdays and I'm checking this place out for the Tuesday Fajita Special!  Greeted by four friendly staff members and warm Chips, that is a good sign!  They have really fixed this place up, it looks like a Fiesta!  Salsa and Pico de Gallo to go with my Chips and Fajitas.  The Salsa was fresh and served with a Spoon (that is a GREAT sign - Pile it on!) with plenty of: Onion, Cilantro and Jalapeno and of course Tomato (I left out the Tomato one time and another time no one could guess the primary ingredient).  This Salsa had good flavor, better than most and \"spicier\" than many places serve.  Maybe it needed more Garlic?  Want a kiss?  The Pico was made with Cabbage and it better be if you want me as a fan.  I had Two plates of Pico and two bowls of Salsa!  Anyone want to go on a road trip in a smart car with me?  If you don't get it you don't get it!  The Fajitas came out sizzling and appeared plain compared to the overcooked version I'm used too!  The flavor was very good and perfectly cooked!  These are not the overly seasoned variety that gives Mexican food a bad name.  the Peppers and onions were perfect still full of color since they had been prepared so carefully, or perhaps they only wanted to serve me fast!  The result was better than I expected!  The only letdown of the meal was the Guacamole, though fresh it had way too much SALT!  Which I'm sure they will fix because Nothing else in the meal was salty. I'm not a fan of Guac anyway so it matters very little to me!  It only appears here for you!  Here is the yelp star rating for my dine for lunch today!  Salsa: 3.65 yelp stars (I ate two bowls)  Pico de Gallo: two plates and 3.95 stars  Chicken Fajitas:  4.25 stars  The Service was great, friendly, polite and the request were executed perfectly!  The service as usual with my reviews does not increase the overall rating of my review!   The music was what I would expect and some of the better tunes that I hope for though do not expect!  This is at least the fourth Business to go in this spot since I moved to the area in 2003."}
{"text":"CLOSED DOWN - there's a restaurant called Tacos and Tequilla standing in its place.  I'm only giving it 4 stars so Yelp sort doesn't bury this review at the bottom."}
{"text":"Not as bad as last review said it is. Food was delicious and at a great price. Perfect place to go if you want to talk with a friend and not be interrupted because the service is slow! Sad to say the waiter walked past us several times while we waited for him to take the order and had to tell him we wants the check. You would think he would of brought it when we asked for a to go box."}
{"text":"Well, I am sad to say this was a major disappointment. I was excited to check out a new restaurant close to home. The inside of the restaurant was nice and clean, but that's pretty much the only nice thing to say.  Our service was sloooooow, and we were the only table - so what gives? We finally had to flag down another waitress to take our check because our waitress was visibily sitting in a booth in the bar area texting (she was also wandering around on her phone most of the time we were there). That's just poor management.  We ordered fajitas, the portion was fine, but the food itself was soooo bland. What the heck! No nice flavor/spices, no nice char on the meat, nothing. The beans and rice that came with it were also a bore.   Margaritas...also a big let down. There was a sign advertising their special that night - $3.99 Margarita. Yay! We ordered 2 frozens, they come out and aren't tasty at all (again, bland - like just ice and maybe some sweet & sour mix - not a trace of tequila). But, I thought for four bucks, it's not worth complaining. THEN comes the check, we weren't given the margaritas on special. WTH! Isn't it assumed you should serve YOUR SPECIAL? Come on Fiesta Jalisco, that's lame.  Anyway, won't be back. Doubt they'll stay in business long at this rate."}
{"text":"Good salsa, chips, and beans.  I ordered Dos Amigos.  No flavor but the taste in onions and shrimp linger in my mouth.  My meal was shrimp and chicken in sour cream cheese sauce to be paired with rice, refried beans, and choice of flour or corn tortillas.  I didn't enjoy it.  I may not be back but if I do, I hope to change my review.  The interior was nice in the dining area.  Love the Mexican tiles, artwork, and seats.  I'm still on a quest to find good Mexican food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Tonight was the second visit for me and my wife since we moved to Matthews in early February. I am a big Mexican food fan and I think it's pretty hard to find a good Mexican place in North Carolina. I guess I've been spoiled since I lived in Arizona for a couple of months and have had it in California and Texas.  Nonetheless... out of all of the Mexican restaurants I have been to in NC, this one is my favorite.   The first night we went, they had a guacamole cart and someone making it fresh in front of us. It was very good. In fact, it was the first time that my wife tried it - and she is a pretty picky eater - but she liked it. I didn't find it overly salty and the flavors all balanced each other out.   I always judge a Mexican restaurant by the salsa. I personally like spicy stuff, so when the salsa is bland, I can pretty much count on the meal being bland. And that's NOT what Mexican food is supposed to be! That's what American food is. :-) The salsa here is very good - cilantro, diced tomatoes, onion, and of course - tomato. It was decently spicy too but not overly spicy.   I have had tacos, an enchilada, a chile relleno, and an avocado tostada. The tacos were really good, pretty standard but they had good flavor. I usually don't like enchiladas, but I liked the one I had here. I wasn't a huge fan of the chile relleno because it wasn't just a pepper with meat and cheese... it had some sort of batter that it was cooked in. I guess that's the style down here since the other places I have been had it the same way.   The avocado tostada (my meal for tonight) was very delicious. I hadn't ever had that before, so I was being a little adventurous. It had a corn tortilla on the bottom, and was topped with chicken, lettuce, tomato, and salsa. Everything was very good.  I will definitely be back and I hope that they stick around for a while!"}
{"text":"The one thing you will not do here is leave hungry - assuming you stay long enough to place your order, of course, and that is part of the problem.  Some restaurants you expect to not be terribly fancy, so you go in knowing that. In this case, the outside doesn't look like much, but it gives you hope that there is a quaint little joint on the inside. Be prepared for what lies within.  The floors are bare, the tables sparse - it's like a scene out of Pacific Heights, and not when Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine fix up the house. I'm talking after Michael Keaton removes all the fixtures, so all you have left is a bare floor and a card table.  This isn't to say it's bad - it's just completely unexpected, especially if you've been here before. The cute little Italian place that used to be here? No more.  If you make it this far, however, the service is solid, and the food good - and you get plenty of it, so sit back and enjoy. Just don't lean too far or the card table may collapse."}
{"text":"I never leave reviews but Omg best Mexican in Charlotte. What a hidden gem!!! I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I lived in California for 7 years, and this is the best Mexican food I've eaten since leaving in 1999. The moment you walk in the door you are greeted by warm and friendly staff, you're quickly shown to a table, and you're quickly brought warm chips, salsa and pico de gallo ( the salsa is surpurb!)   I have had quite a variety of food from there over the last couple of months, and everything has been absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Normally, one of my favorites in Charlotte. Been there dozens of times. But the trend has been downward the past few trips.  The last visit, the AC wasn't working (or wasn't on). The host was actually sleeping on the couch in the front when we walked in. That doesn't inspire confidence. The service is not as good as it used to be.  I'm not a fan of soft drinks in the can at a restaurant. They've been leaning toward that lately.  The food is still good - and always has been. I will say the chips were not warm on the last visit, and my wife's plate was hot when she was served - but mine was cold as ice. Nothing major, but odd.  I'm sure this place has been hurt by the construction on Independence. I've seen them rally in the past after slumping. Let's hope that happens again.   If you've never been there - give it one shot."}
{"text":"This place will go out of business anyday..served  me shrimp that look like it died in a fiery crash. Cooked under the broiler with the shells on..had to dig the meat out of the burnt shells and pretty much made confetti out of the meal..son had pollo fundido..came out grilled chicken strips with some kind of dry rub..they don't know what pollo fundido is..I've ordered that dish in at least 10 different Mex restaurants in 3 diff states its always the same..my wife had an enchilada sitting on a plate soaked in grease..the food was so bad we didn't even complain because we were embarrassed for them. La Unica is the best Mex place in Matthews not fancy but great consistent food. We went to Fiesta Crapjalisco because the wait was long at La Unica and we thought we would try this place. Great parking though, because it is a dying business....they better get a clue...bad restaurants don't last long in Charlotte ."}
