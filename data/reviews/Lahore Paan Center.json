{"text":"Pani puri was great but the woman ripped us off. She made us pay unreasonable amount of \"tax\"; customer service was below average."}
{"text":"I'm rating this place as a 4 because of the lack of customer service/long waits. The food was very good and we loved thatbwe could try the pani puri. The lassis were really fresh as the employee ran to purchase a mango. This was a small restaurant but we were definitely engaged by reading all the articles all over the walls. I found the food to be really refreshing and not too spicy. The place was fairly empty but the wait was longer than it should have been."}
{"text":"There paan is delicious service is okay we had the kulfi and that was to die for it was really good we were visiting from USA and loved this place"}
{"text":"Can't believe India and Pakistan find time to fight over Kashmir's borders instead of gulping down mass quantities of Kashmiri tea over a happy, friendly chat any chance they get.  Never having had this specific regional chai before, I thought it was just a tweaked version of your typical masala chai. WRONG. This tea uses green tea leaves, pistachios, and saffron which gives it a nice pink appearance. It looks, smells, and tastes completely different but is equally wonderful.   We also ordered a sev puri (ok) and brought out the inner \"fob\" by getting two paans (yummmm).  Make sure you bring cash!! Also if you only order grilled corn you can't sit inside, which is kind of a douche move on the resraurant's part. Then again, I haven't seen it at the peak of lunch/dinner so maybe there's a reason."}
{"text":"i had paan. it was nice. the lady gave me 5 for $10.   Metha paan."}
{"text":"Over-priced and over hyped. The owner's wife is rude. They are charging ya 8 dollars plus tax for a damn falooda. 8 dollars for the plate of Dahi bhalla.  On top of that, they have all semi-nude DESI songs or award shows on the TV 24/7 which at times very inappropriate when you are sitting with the family. The place is very dirty and dingy. They rip you off. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time this weekend after asking several opinions on Gerrard Street. We were looking for the best pani puri and we were definitely not disappointed. The location itself Is small and very busy. For us, our main goal was to try kashmiri chai and pani puri and for the flavor profile and prices I would give it four stars."}
{"text":"The royal falooda was great. Not too sweet like most stores but the price was a bit high at $4.99 for a small drink.   The seating area was quite small with a 40 min seating time.   Overall experience was mediocre and there was nothing special."}
{"text":"I try to go here to get some Kashmiri Chai every time I'm in Toronto.  Great stuff.  I also recently tried the Bun Kebab (Desi Burger) which was also pretty good (very spicy).  Definitely worth checking out this place if you are in the area of Gerrard Street."}
{"text":"The service was sub-par and the hygiene was questionable. The gentleman behind the counter was handling cash and proceeded to make orders with no gloves and without washing his hands. When prompted to do so, he became hostile.   On previous experiences, the food and snacks are nothing special. It's worth going to other Paan shops down the street for a more tasty menu that's more hygienic and have better service."}
{"text":"Nice lady working here with an outdoor stall set up and small interior with seating.  This place serves up popular Indian street snacks. We ordered a \"Pani Puri\" for $6.   This comes with some small \"puris\" which are tiny fried bits of dough hollowed out inside, they look something like huge rice puffs. You then \"stuff\" the puris with a potato and chickpea mixture and dip them in some different sauces.   Slightly baffling but it was interesting nonetheless. Worth a try just for the novelty."}
