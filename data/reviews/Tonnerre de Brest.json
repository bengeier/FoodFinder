{"text":"This is one of my favourite little restaurants in Montreal. It's tiny, intimate, and has a great menu! The staff is amazing.  It may be run by a family, but I'm not all together sure. Whether or not they are a family, they seem to treat their patrons like family. My grandparents used to eat here a lot a few years ago, but my grandfather does not like driving into the city. Last year I called for a reservation and they asked if it was for my grandparents. Even after a couple of years not going, they still remembered them. They are always pleasant, ready with great suggestions for both meal choices and wine pairing. They have delicious options on their menu and a reasonably priced and varied table d'hote. 

I would recommend this restaurant for a romantic intimate date or a very small group (2-5 max). It's a really tiny place so you might also want to make a reservation, especially if you're more than two people."}

{"text":"Food was o.k., nothing special; my escargot entree was lukewarm, the meat was chewy.  The waitress is very unfriendly and snotty, does not offer any suggestion as to what we should order.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"I've been there quite a year ago, though it's only today that i've thought about it. 

Its a small 25-30 places restaurant that expand their business in Summer with a nice patio outside. The place is cozy, with some nice decoration. As soon as you enter the restaurant you don't feel that the sophisticated but simple, French Cuisine would alienate you with their complicated menu or really expensive à la carte Menu. No it's simple, no complication; a blackboard with today's menu. I remember having Veal Brain ; Cervelle de veau with some vegetable aside. It was quite good, I like the texture of veel brain, even though it's quite a no-no to lot of person it's pretty sophisticated meal. not too mushy or too cooked, well done! My friend had a steak and other friend got a goat cheese salad. The service is great, the restaurant feels like they have an established name and clients that come regularly. It's not really expensive for the place and the quality of the food. Ohh and the Bread is good! yeah!!!"}
