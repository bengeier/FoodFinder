{"text":"Good stuff!  Took my 11 year old son there. We thoroughly enjoyed the food. Loved the butternut squash soup! I like the decor too."}
{"text":"Just what Oakville needs. Organic and vegan, with cooked sit down options as well as grab and go salads, pastries, yogurts. Cold pressed juices, smoothies and coffee. This place has great energy and wonderful food, the owner is super friendly, well informed and kind. This is a restaurant with integrity and that's not easy to find these days. Also this restaurant only uses purified water in all their food, how amazing is that? Please support this awesome cause and get yourself healthy."}
{"text":"Great ambience, excellent service and great selection of food. We went there for lunch and absolutely loved the food. We had the tacos and the cauliflower, both items were very tasty. Loved the service!! They also have snacks that you can purchase, including muffins. Pretty cool place."}
{"text":"So excited to try this new west end vegan restaurant with my friends for a bday treat.
We all started with the special potato soup with corn bread that had kale and fennel. Both were delicious! The soup was thick and creamy and the corn bread was a dry, crumbly texture and it was a great start to the meal.
Friend 1 ordered the tacos filled with purple yams on a soft corn tortilla.....very nice flavour. Friend 2 ordered the cauliflower and spinach dish which had a nice lemony flavour. I ordered the chickpea crepe which was filled with broccoli and cabbage I believe. It was cooked just right and tasted wonderful. The cauliflower dish and chickpea crepe came with a side salad which had a nice light vinaigrette, but part way through I noticed a hair in the salad. I would have assumed it was my hair but it was in the salad, not on it, so I couldn't be sure.
My friend had the special pumpkin cheesecake for dessert which she enjoyed. It had a light, somewhat granular texture....not smooth or creamy, but very tasty. Unfortunately, we found a 2\"piece of fuzz in it. I ordered the oat and maple butter tart which  tasted horrible.....I had my friends taste it to make sure it wasn't just my taste buds and they agreed. I told the chef/owner and he took it back, tasted it and agreed. He said he tried a new vegan margarine and that resulted in the poor taste. He threw them all out. We ordered 2gf choc chip cookies instead and I enjoyed it. It def tasted gf so my son would not like it but I really enjoyed it.
When the bill arrived, we were not charged for any of the dessert items and we were all given cards to return for a discounted meal.
The place is cute and small with a few tables to eat in and packaged items to take out. 
 The food was presented well and the staff were friendly. I will go back as anyone can make a mistake, but they took the proper measures to make up for it."}
{"text":"Very talented vegan chef serving GF, organic food, in a lovely atmosphere with a friendly staff. Presentation is excellent. Excellent value. We had the burritos and the bean mushroom burger served with either salad of home fries. Wow!!! Burritos were unlike anything I have ever tasted. Beautiful complex layered flavours. Best burger ever. We didn't try the deserts but they looked great. Smoothies, juices coffee available as well as some prepared food including deserts available to go.
Just lunch as of this date but an evening tasting dinner with wine pairings is coming at the end of this month. Looking forward to a dinner menu in the fall.
We talked with the owner chef about our dietary needs re the tasting dinner and he was most accommodating."}
{"text":"This is probably the best vegan gluten free restaurant in the whole area. Everything is super fresh and nothing is boring. The salads aren't only boring greens, they come with sprouts and edible flowers. You can order your coffee with almond milk. The place is super clean and the owner is very friendly. They have outdoor seating facing Kerr street. They also offer quick to go bites. All healthy stuff. We will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the epitome of what a vegan restaurant should be; excellent service, impeccable food, wonderful chef, and brilliant decor. When it comes to food quality and taste, this restaurant competes with the very best vegan spots in Toronto. 

Some highlights:
 1. black bean burger with the Gouda cheese. Please do yourself a favour and add the (coconut based) Gouda cheese. The taste is EXPLOSIVE! It's the perfect compliment to the bean burger. 
2. The tacos. The tacos were presented beautifully! Very much of finesse. The cucumber relish gives it a nice sweet taste, but you get that kick from a couple slivers of hot pepper. Very well balanced dish!
3. The smoked tomato soup is a MUST have. 
4. The brownie is a loaf style brownie, but is wonderfully crafted; even has flax in it! Topped with a coconut cream chia pudding and chocolate pudding gnash, and gooseberries on top. Again, very well balanced dessert. 

All in all, was a fabulous experience, and I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great new plant based cafe. The burger is outstanding. If you have a gluten allergy, there are several options."}
