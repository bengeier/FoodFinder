{"text":"this place had a great selection. The mussels were outstanding and the staff was very professional!!. TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had read some mixed reviews but I honestly don't understand the negative feedback. This was our first time and we found street parking right around the corner. We made the 7:00 reservations only 2 days in advance and the place was about half full when we got there and very full by 8:00 with some folks eating at the bar. We were seated within minutes at a great table near the front window. It was nice and private so we could talk with our friends. Water and bread was on the table within minutes with drinks shortly behind. we ordered the beans and green and italian fries as appetizers, The beans and greens were good but I've had better, The italian fries, which seemed to be fries with flash fried kale and garlic with a pesto mayo were unbelievably good. I had the Del Sol pasta and it was very flavorful, though a little salty. The chicken was very moist and the sauce was very good. My husband had the cacciatore special and said the chicken was very good but they sauce could have been a bit more flavorful. The service was very good the entire night, I would like to go back, and try the pizza or flat bread."}
{"text":"I grew up just the street from Pino's and my family were probably its most regular customers -- we got take-out at least once or twice a week for many many years, and always enjoyed the pizza and hot subs. I've just been back for the first time in 6 years after moving away, and was pretty unimpressed... The decor looks nice, but the food was wayyyyy overpriced for what it was. $22 dollars for a plate of pasta, really? It claimed to be \"fresh pasta,\" but it was completely tough and chewy (not \"al dente,\" just undercooked), and not very large. I'm not sure when the restaurant changed, but I think it really missed the mark... People WANT a casual, friendly, affordable neighborhood place that they can bring the kids to. Why take that away?"}
{"text":"I went to Pino's recently, only to be disappointed by the owner himself. I guess I should have read the reviews on here before going, seeing as a lot of people echo the sentiments that I feel.

After my mother sent back her extremely oversalted steak, the chef came out to \"apologize\". It was very embarrassing how he chastised her for not enjoying her meal. He then snidely commented, as walking away, that he would \"never salt his steak again\". I don't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother. She was very polite about sending it back and certainly didn't deserve any attitude. We had an event to attend, which we were very clear with to our waitress. So when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. Well, I have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. I said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. 

The drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. Sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! He ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out. 

Overall, embarrassing. It was an embarrassing situation for anyone to witness. Take heed of the negative comments on this site. I certainly wish I would have."}
{"text":"Please, never go to this restaurant. The food ranges mediocre to downright bland, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't so overpriced. I'm sorry, but $20 for a flatbread that's half the size of a pizza? Is it supposed to be an entr√©e, or a joke? $25 for a plate of spaghetti? Even if the pasta is handmade (and I don't think it is) that's crazy. The wine list is pretty ok, but this isn't the only place in Pittsburgh to drink wine, and I can guarantee you that anywhere else you choose would have better food. 

I'd probably be more forgiving of the lack-luster menu if it weren't for other factors. Because the real downfall at Pino's is the owner, Joe. This man has no tact, no grace--and judging by the food, absolutely no talent in the kitchen. I've been to Pino's a handful of times, as it's near my home, and honestly, I really wanted to like it. But each time I've been in, I'm surprised by the extent of this man's unprofessionalism. He has a very large presence and is very outgoing, but not in the way you want. You'll notice from other reviews that he does not take kindly to criticism. If you don't like something you ordered, keep your mouth shut or be prepared for a debate over the quality of the product. I've even witnessed him making racist comments about his diners--for example, I overheard him one evening saying he was glad that two \"asian\" customers had come in that night, \"because they're good tippers.\" I don't know how they didn't hear him, because the dining room isn't that big, and this guy doesn't know how to keep his voice down. 

That was pretty much the last straw for me. The amount of pride Joe and his staff seem to have in their restaurant is completely disproportionate to the quality of food, and certainly their customer service. Take my advice, don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick drink and a bite to eat after spending the day at the Frick. The staff was VERY hospitable to my dog and got him water! Could have been more attentive to the outside tables but Great food and a cute place overall. Would definitely recommend. Oh, and try the tiramisu!"}
{"text":"I must admit that the first time I went to Pino's (about 6 months ago), I was NOT a fan for several reasons.  However, after coming home from brunch, the experience was enough to not only completely change my mind, but to keep me coming back.

My boyfriend had the scallops and I have the pino benedict (eggs benedict, of course).  My boyfriend literally looked like he was having a religious experience with the scallops.  His eyes were closed, he was moaning, and it took him about 25 minutes to eat 3 scallops.  He said it was the first time in his life that he ever wanted to take so much time to chew his food.
My dish was delicious and the in-house made bread was fresh and savory.  

Overall, I am very pleased with the lunch menu and the range of dishes that are available.  We'll definitely be back for brunch."}
{"text":"We had dinner and drinks tonight and it was great as usual. We have been here often, with couples, with family, and for a large family event. Service and food have always been top notch."}
{"text":"My wife and I very much enjoyed our meal and the service. I had the Carbonara and my wife had the Chicken Scaloppini. Both very good and large servings."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I can't attest to the food, as it was never served to us. We walked out after 1:15 minutes and only one in our party of 4 had received part of his meal ( main, hot course only - no salad)
The rest of us got NOTHING for our wait.  We kept trying to get our server's attention to inquire about our meals, but she must have totally forgotten about us.
We were starving and went to Alladins in Squirrel Hill for  a decent meal with fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful evening eating outdoors on a perfect Pittsburgh spring night.  The charcuterie plate worked well as an appetizer for 3 and included a fantastic balsamic dressing.  I had the best pasta and white clam sauce I've ever experienced, and the other members of our party enjoyed their entrees, as well.  Nice find in the Point Breeze neighborhood."}
{"text":"I often have lunch at the nearby Point Brugge Cafe, but I decided to give Pino's a try today for a change of pace.  Bad idea.  My lady friend and I started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and \"Italian frites.\"  The latter, which the menu described as \"fresh cut, twice cooked, fresh herbs & roasted garlic,\" were basically just regular-ass french fries - decent, but nowhere near worth their $6 price tag.  The greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 FREAKIN' DOLLARS for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce.  Talk about a profit margin!

As a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper.  It was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the FM radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers.  Who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a \"nice\" restaurant?  Classless.

Conclusion: I'd rather wait 45 minutes for a table at Point Brugge than be seated immediately at Pino's."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!! Evening started pretty badly and did not get much better.  
We had reservations for 5 people at 7PM this past Saturday. Two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess. She was vague about seating us and we decided to wait at the bar. When the rest of our group arrived (on time!!), I informed the hostess and she looked at me blankly and then the packed restaurant.  She told me it would be awhile. Huh? When asked what \"awhile\" was, she said 20min.  But then seated us in 5 (she had to bus a table which I take it as one of the things she dislikes about her job - that and people).

Food was a let down. Potato latkes were greasy and blah.  Fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks.  Pumpkin risotta was heavy and confusing flavor wise.  Others had the same sentiments.

Service was rough.  Long waits and lack of attentiveness. Noise level (couldn't converse at all) made the night just a bit harer to tolerate.
Not sure Pino's will get a repeat visit.  Disappointment:("}
{"text":"I have been going to Pino's for several years with my family so I feel well qualified to give a balanced review rather than basing it on a single experience, good or bad. Every restaurant can have a bad day. And even the worst places can please some customers every now and then. 

What you get at Pino's is great service and excellent food. If your idea of Italian is the Olive Garden, you are in for an education and a treat. This is the real deal. We have a family of picky eaters including a full blown celiac and we all love it.

Yes, over the years I have twice seen owner/chef Joe unhappy with unhappy customers. In one case the customer was arrogant and offensive. On the other occasion, Joe should have swallowed his pride if only to avoid the coordinated revenge reviews that followed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem and I wish I would have found it sooner.  It is absolutely adorable and cozy at the same time.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting immediately upon entering the restaurant.  The wine is absolutely fantastic.  The food is amazing, especially the arancini, bellagio pasta and margherita pizza.  Our server was exceptional, and the chef was even better.  He walked around all night making sure every table enjoyed their food and thanking them for coming.  If you are looking for great wine, even better food, and exceptional service this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Would consider this an average restaurant with some negatives.  Giving it a lower rating due to the high cost in relation to the quality.  Food was mediocre and nothing special.  Had the beans and greens and they were bland.  Could have used some red pepper flakes or other spice to kick them up a notch.  Salads were boring.  Just basic lettuce and tomato.  I had the acorn squash ravioli and it was too sweet to eat a whole plate full.  My husband had the cod and commented on the lack of flavor.  Our friends were not pleased with their food either.  Rude and slow service.   Wine prices were very high.  Over all disappointing for the price."}
{"text":"I normally love Pinos. I'm a member of their Diners  Club, live 2 blocks away and often walk there with my dog and eat outside. They are very dog friendly. However, this evening I sat at the bar planing to order wine and dinner. While the bartender did give me a wine list, she then proceeded to ignore me, more interested in chatting it up with the couple at the end of the bar. After 5 minutes, I left. I thought the days of ignoring and disrespecting solo female diners were behind us. I went to Park Brugge where the service at the bar with Amanda is always top notch!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot. The staff is attentive and friendly. The food is awesome and the ambiance is perfect. 

We had a great experience here. The mussels were flavorful and my steak main course was perfect. 

I totally recommend Pino's."}
{"text":"New fall items on the menu--their grilled romaine salad is fabulous!"}
{"text":"GREAT neighborhood restaurant, with charming atmosphere and awesome food!
Only possible complaint could be that the Lamb Bolognese serving was a little skimpy..
but that's because it was perfection!"}
{"text":"We were huge fans of Pinos a few years back before the wine bar concept was adopted. In all honesty, we haven't been back for a year though we kept saying \" we have to get to Pinos!\" Needless to say, we were disappointed.  The place has changed and not for the better.  It seems in an effort to create a quaint wine bar, Pinos lost sight of the original draw and that was the food.  The menu has been scaled back considerably.  Though the food was adequate, it's not the same.  I came here because the food was amazing and with that no longer being the case, I doubt we will return.  Hopefully, things will change back to how they were.  Customer advice for what it's worth.  Refocus on great italian food not a wine bar concept.   Sometimes a liquor license is not the best investment!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice -- once for lunch and once for dinner. The lunch experience was not noteworthy in a positive or negative sense. Pretty middle-of-the-road. The flatbread pizza I shared with a friend was very yummy. The true colors came out at dinner. 

The service was TERRIBLE. There were three servers for the entire restaurant, which was insufficient. And the food took forever. We ordered a roasted vegetable platter appetizer, which was delish. After that, it all went down hill. Two of us ordered salads and one ordered a pasta dish. It took an inordinately long time for three simple (and mostly cold) meals to arrive. The salads were fair at best. It was a lot of lettuce and not much else. 

We are not planning to return any time soon. We actually ended up there only because there was a wait at the (significantly better) Point Brugge down the block. In retrospect, we should have spent our time waiting there for better food and better service than for what we ended up with a Pino's."}
{"text":"Great food for a busy Saturday night. Everything was fast and fresh. Flatbread pizza was delicious."}
{"text":"I went with ladies of Dine & Dish to Pino's in January. It was good, solid food.  It is located in the quaint neighborhood of Point Breeze. The service was a bit lacking but it got the job done."}
{"text":"TASTY OPTION FOR SUNDAY BRUNCH 

I've read the reviews and what seems to ring true is that Pino's has a good Sunday Brunch. Thankfully that's when me and my gang decided to check out this little lovely! 

Brunch menu has both traditional brunch fair and some Italian twists. My mum had Challah French toast and loved it. Pops had their breakfast risotto with a fried egg on top - I tried that and it had a nice kick to it.

Other folks at the table had the eggs Benedict, salad, and Sammy. Over all everyone was happy and it was only half full so easy to talk and hang out. 

And for the music complainer (you whining stinker) we had a nice iPod mix on when we were there!"}
{"text":"The food here is ok but not worth the price. $15 corking fee? $9 a glass of garbage wine? Me thinks not.

What really tops it off is the owner is beyond rude and doesn't care about the business. I heard it used to be much better but now I don't know anyone who eats there..."}
{"text":"OK.  As you can see, I gave Pino's a Four Star review. Also, please notice that this is a two part review.
Part One:
Last night was my first night at Pino's.  The interior is warm and inviting and a seat by the windows was great.  We got there when they just opened so there was still some prep work going on and for me that's just fine.  Ordered a Makers Mark Manhattan and I have to say that it was one of a very few that ranked as excellent!  The only problem was that the cherry was stemless and had a pit, which, for my dining companion, was a BIG surprise.  The bread and  Sundried Tomato spread was excellent.
For Starters, I had the evening special Chicken Liver Mousse which was presented on French toast rounds and accompanied by a pickled slaw with dried cherries.  It was very pleasant and a good choice.  For an Entree I chose the Braised Beef Sugo, which was a portion of numerous slices of braised beef served over linguini and covered with the braising liquid. All of the pastas were fresh and made in house. The beef was pull apart tender, but very under-salted.  There were also no salt or pepper shakers to be seen and also no ground pepper offered by the server.  I would have liked the chance to season my meal to my taste...not the chefs.
For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse with berries.  The mousse was a textural surprise for me.  Instead of light and fluffy, it was more of an ice cream consistency.  Very low on sweetness but all the same very enjoyable.

Now, Part Two:

If you're going to serve pasta dishes for $25.00 plus, You need to re-appraise your status and classification.  The restaurant tends to lean more towards upscale but at a better, affordable price point.  The interior is attractive, there are linens on the tables, the candles were very clever with the flame surrounded by coffee beans and the service was very good. 
 Things that I think should be considered are:
-New choice of cherries for bar drinks.  Hopefully w/o pits, or at least a verbal warning from the server.
-Salt and pepper shakers on the tables.  Swallow your pride.  Not every meal is going to be placed in front of someone sharing your same taste buds.
-Coffee.  The coffee was great.  Usually I take cream and sugar but I was able to drink this coffee black just like a grown-up.
-Cream.  Really?  Little plastic creamers?  Really?  You're selling noodles for $25.00 and you can't present the coffee course with a bit more panache?  Spring for some inexpensive metal creamers and perhaps present it with the sugars on a small tray with the beverage.
- The Disco Menu Board.  What is usually reserved to announce the nightly Beer, Wing and Rib Platter is used here to tell, I don't know who, about tonight's specials.  All painstakingly hand written by an employee who possesses excellent calligraphic skills.  All, of course, done in vivid day-glo colors which screams at you when the black light is turned on.
Why not try a simple frame with easy rear access to just hang a copy of the specials with a title of ...maybe...Tonight's Selections.  Keep a few spaced out on the bar for any patrons having a pre-dinner cocktail.
If you insist on keeping this Twentieth Century example of advanced technology, then why not mount one of those singing fish right above it.

I really did enjoy my experience at Pino's, but I think you reached your goal a while back but kept over doing and adding to an already spot on formula."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS dinner of the wild mushroom w/arugula pizza (the crust thin & crispy) and the carbonara pasta ending with the tiramisu all shared with my daughter in my neighborhood---this is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Another amazing dinner at Pino's! Great wat to celebrate my birthday. Bolognese is the best I've ever had.  This is a must try restaurant you've not been to. Thanks Joe"}
{"text":"I went to Pino's to celebrate a friends birthday on a Thursday night.  I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful.  We made reservations, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in.  

My two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so naturally we order one of everything that looks good.  We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella.  This was an impressive way to start out the meal.  We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer.  This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny.  The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order.  It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish.  

I ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it.  I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night.  Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me.  

The service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable.  My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce.  Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on.  Talk about service!  The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5.  

Added bonus:  Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen.  Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way)."}
{"text":"This was the place I brought friends visiting from out of town when I wanted to show them the classy Italian  spots in Pittsburgh. After my visit last night, I have no desire to ever go again. 

I don't know the owner, Joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said \"dish looks beautiful.\" He was always confident in his food which I guess is a good thing if the good is delicious,  which it usually is  

The table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've never had the steak as I'm vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy.  The  best part? He comes out again and says \"I really enjoyed the steak you sent back.\" He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up!
At this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation. The owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said \"it's not my job to make people happy\" that's strange considering he wants our business. 
So the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change. Eventually another customer helps make change and they leave.

I couldn't finish my dinner I was so mad.  Maybe Joe was having a bad day but there is no excuse for how he treated those customers.  Sorry, we will never step foot in here again."}
{"text":"This is just a special place.  I haven't been in for about six months even though I can walk there. And everyone welcomed me like it was Cheers.  The food is always great but they have added a few things that look amazing.  If you love Italian and don't try this place you are missing something good."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant! Very cozy. Sat at the bar for vday, and the bartender was very attentive and helpful. Shrimp, scallop, lobster pasta was excellent. Not too loud."}
{"text":"I can't say enough wonderful things about this restaurant!' The pasta is home made  and cooked to perfection!  Al dente!   I had the bolognese which was amazing!!! The anti pasta course is a must!  The cheese is delightful and the meats are sliced thinly and to perfection allowing g the flavor to come thru.  The burrata is also a must.  Silky & creamy served with peppery arugula.  But most importantly, the chef & wait staff are some of the loveliest people in the world!  Jen was our server who was very attentive and sweet'. Chef thoughtfully chose all of our meals & deserts! In fact creating a customized desert of mouse & house made ice cream along with tiramisu so that we could try it all on our first visit!  BRAVO PINO!!' We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I live in Connecticut and visit family in Pittsburgh often. Pino's is my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant. 

I don't have one favorite dish because I usually order one of the specials, which change often. I ordered from the regular menu for the first time a couple of weeks ago. The Bolognese sauce on tagliatelle pasta (I think the menu has it on rigatoni) was as good as what I had in Italy. My son had the seafood risotto. It was so good, I need to order it next time.

My brother is a retired chef and hates to eat out because few restaurants are worth paying for what he can make better at home. He loved his meal and his tastes of everyone else's at the table (there were 10 of us). He was giddy to enjoy eating out for the first time in in a long time.

Oh, they also make great cocktails and have a very, very nice wine list.

Oh, if you think you can only get good fries and mussels at the Belgium place around the corner, try Pino's. The fries are topped with crispy herbs... yum!

No, it isn't cheap. But, I'm happy to pay for quality."}
{"text":"Very disappointing meal.  After waiting for a half hour, my meal arrived and we were told that my friend's meal would be coming in a few minutes. Very awkward.t.  Salad was average at best.  The beets tasted like canned beets and the chicken was covered with blackish oil from a burnt oil pan.

  Then, to make matters worse the chef came out to argue with a patron who returned her food.  The chef came out to humiliate the customer explaining that her returned steak was great and himself was enjoying it.  Eating food from a customers plate was a real turn-off....what else does he do when cooking? 

To make matters worse, when paying the bill, the chef did not have change for a $100 bill for the customer who returned her steak..  It was very uncomfortable watching the elderly customer and her young friend deal with the situation. He kept  loudly requesting a credit card  and the women did not have one.   Another customer provided them with change as the chef crumbled the check. I think I would have just left and not paid....give the lady great for dealing with such a lunatic.

Long story short....if you want to eat below average food and watch a chef loose it....this is your place!"}
{"text":"I went to Pino's with my three other friends for Restaurant Week and was underwhelmed and completely disappointed. We chose an option for each course of  the very limited Restaurant Week menu. I selected the baked eggplant caprese appetizer, Lazy Man lasagna Florentine and then the panna cotta for dessert. 

Baked eggplant caprese: the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess. 
Lazy Man Lasagna Florentine: it was essentially two huge lasagna noodles sandwiching huge clumps of spinach (I'm talking like a 3-inch high pile of clumped spinach) with a few mushrooms peppered in. The spinach ratio was out of control and I honestly ate a few bites and couldn't even continue. 
Panna cotta: this was the most decent of the items we ordered.

My friend ordered off the regular menu, which she advised not to do since her food would come out at a different time?? Why? 
We tried my friend's appetizer of the Italian Fries, which are described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at Point Brugge...but it was just a bowl of regular French fries, which were lackluster and misleading. She also got the house soup with chickpeas and it looked like Spaghetti-o's and tasted even worse.

I don't know where all the positive reviews are coming from. There was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way. All of it was overpriced and below mediocre. I wasted my money, and I will never, ever go back there."}
{"text":"A decent Italian restaurant serving delicious fresh made bread with hummus, flat breads, salads, soups, and pasta. Outdoor seating is available in nice weather, and the service is friendly. Overall, not a bad place, but not super exciting either - Pino's suffers from its close proximity to the excellent  Point Brugge Cafe. It also gets quite noisy inside so it's hard to carry on a conversation, and seems to attract a somewhat older crowd of people."}
{"text":"Pino's is an mid-level Italian place with a charming neighborhood atmosphere. The prices aren't the cheapest, but for what it is Pino's delivers small plates and dinners that are satisfying without breaking the bank. The lamb bolognese is one of my personal favorites, as well as pretty much any of the appetizers. I also love the creative cocktail list and the half price bottles of wine for happy hour. There are few places in Pittsburgh that can get me as excited about cocktails as Pino's. My roommate and I have come here with friends and sat at the bar for hours eating and drinking a variety of delightful things. In short, they do drinks and food quite well for the price. 

The reason Pino's only gets three stars is the unfortunate inconsistency with service I've encountered. I get treated differently depending on who I come in with, and that's unprofessional. If I'm with my roommate and one of my friends (both of whom work nearby) we all get seated quickly and treated extremely well. In short, it feels like my presence is valued. When I've come to Pino's with people who aren't in with the owners though, I've had a thoroughly lackluster experience. Once I came on my birthday with my boyfriend and frankly was let down. We waited awkwardly for a very long time to be seated even though there were empty tables and in general had a very impersonal experience. I felt embarrassed having spoken so highly of Pino's to him beforehand. I know I'll be back for the occasional happy hour or small dinner, but Pino's isn't somewhere I would take anyone I wanted to impress due to the problematic service."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst places I have been to recently. I have had pasta come out of the freezer that was better prepared. $70 for a mushy rigatoni chicken dish and 2 glasses of wine (incl 20% gratuity.) service was very poor - on our table of 5 server couldn't remember what anyone had for drinks or dinner ever. You need to write down something on your pad like woman in blue del sol/cab sauv to help you, that's fine but don't come back all clueless like you had never heard us order. I won't be going back.  Seating was also poor, I had reservations and walked in before a large party, who was seated before me. Meaning I arrived at the hostess station first, and they took the party behind me before asking me my name. I was not the first, nor the last, to arrive for my party and reservation was in my name."}
{"text":"Very busy in the evening, need to wait for a while to get a table. Wide range of wine selection.
Calamari appetizer 4/5
Lobster and scallop pasta 5/5"}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews, and believe me, I wanted to LOVE this place.  I love its location (it's embedded in a little Point Breeze neighborhood), and generally feeling of the place.  But it was bad from the beginning. Detals below, but overall summary: terrible food and management. 
 The chef and manager were unbelievably rude.

Ordering off the special menu, we each had an order of Beef Carpaccio.  The plates and meat were so cold, we could barely pry the mear off the plate.  No acid either.  Terrible.  Alerting our server, she kindly brought us new serving.  They were mush and had obviously been just put under a warming lamp.  They were awful.  And no one asked if they should have been taken off the bill.

Second course.  Duck breast for my friend was lovely.  The Pasta I received was underdone; I've had better at chains.

Third course, a dessert--- disaster. I had an ice cream cake dish.  I know it's supposed to be cold, but it was so frozen I couldn't cut it with a steak knife (perhaps with a machete?)  My friend and I were very polite but did note the problems. The server took mine away and offered to take it off the bill.  The manager and chef decided to discuss us at the bar within ear-shot.  Seriously.  

Nothing was comped, no effort to bring us back, nothing but dead faces from the manager and chef.  I will never go back and am spreading the word. Let's hope a new restaurant moves into the lovely neighborhood space.  After $150, I would hope for more.  Terrible.  DO NOT GO."}
{"text":"I struggle with this review. I wish I could give it a 4, but I really can't hate on it like everyone else. Their wait staff has always been super attentive and friendly, and their happy hours are great! But, a lot of their entrees are a little meh for me, especially for the price. Stick to happy hour for wine/cheese platters, and enjoy a nice summer evening here."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I've gone past so many times, I wish I would have finally eaten here earlier.

The French onion soup was great. The arugula and mozzarella salad was fantastic. For the salad, I liked that they went with mozzarella balls rather than a slice.

The homemade pasta is awesome. We had the bolognese and the arrabbiata. The sauce was thick and flavorful. The arrabbiata was truly spicy. I've found most Pittsburgh restaurants make a very mild arrabbiata. This had a nice heat level."}
{"text":"Some nice wine and good appetizers.  The main courses are quite pricey."}
{"text":"I have had lunch at Pinos's several times probably at least 5 times. Usually I am there  for a business lunch when I am in the area. I find that we are well served, not rushed and the noise level is not too loud at lunch We have several times asked the Chef to make us some special version of his menu and we are always accommodated. To me this is excellent service. Makes you feel like coming back.
I would have to admit that I usually order the garlic fries which are really great. I do this if I am not going back to the office or out to meet a client.
Normally I would add a soup of the day which are always nice, and a sandwich of the day. 
I have never been disappointed and certainly would continue to conduct business lunches here. Pino's has been very reliable and dependable in all aspects.  I would make it 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Went for a quick dinner tonight and couldn't be happier.  I had the tuna and my son had the Carbonara pasta.  Both were excellent.  I love the neighborhood atmosphere.  The meals are pricey but very good."}
{"text":"I decided to try Pino's due to the restaurant week special and boy am I glad that I did! My husband and I made reservations for four on Friday night. We were seated almost immediately on the lovely outdoor patio area. It was a great night to be outside. Although the restuarant is small, the ambiance is wonderful. I could tell thet the guests around me were enjoying themselves as well.

The table decided to order the 3 course menu for 30$ because of the large amount of options. We each decided on a different entree so that we were able to share and get a good idea of all the restaurant has to offer. I started off with a mixed green salad with grileld pears, walnuts and goat cheese. The pears had a nice smokeyness about them that complimented the sweet vinagarette. For my entree, I chose the Arrabiata with rigatoni. The dish was very good but much more spicy than I had expected. I feel that they should have informed me of this or explained the spice level on the menu. Luckily, I enjoy spicy food but I was unable to finish the entree due to the spice level. It was slightly less spicy when I finished it for lunch the next day. My husband had the veal and risotto which he loved. For dessert, I orderedthe peach mille feuille. The portion size was enormous and the peaches were ripe and tasty. However, the marscapone filling hardly tasted of marscapone. I had the opportunity to try my husband's white chocolate tiramisu and was pleasantly surprised by the light but still rich flavors. Our dinner guests also seemed to enjoy their choices as well. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend Pino's for a nice, romantic date night out in Point Breeze. However, I wish they offered the 3 course menu as a regular feature."}
{"text":"Pino's was delicious the first time we went. The second time was a lot more mediocre. The pasta is eh? And over priced for what it tastes like."}
{"text":"Service is outstanding, food is quality with ample portion sizes, especially the appetizers.  
We were there on a Saturday and they had 4 options of red wine at 25$ a  bottle...this made our night.
Only downside was how warm the restaurant was.
But we will be back!"}
{"text":"We have gone several times to sit at the bar and have a light meal.  We have never been disappointed. The bartender Dawn is very knowledgeable about wines and the menu, she is pleasant and helpful.   They also have a frequent diners card which helps you to earn points for future meals.  We really enjoy going here and plan to make it a regular."}
{"text":"I made it back here about two weeks ago.  I must say the experience was night and day compared to the one at the end of July.  Whether or not it was an off night I do not know, but the place was loud and crowded, the service was bad, and the food was mediocre at best.  I should have just waited it out at Point Brugge.  I won't becoming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"There was absolutely nothing not to like.  Reasonably priced wines, home style Italian cooking. Great upbeat ambience."}
{"text":"I am not a huge pasta fan, but this place definitely started to change that.  Everything here was great from the atmosphere, to the service, and the food.

For appetizers my wife and I had the cheese plate and garlic bread.  I was not expecting much from the cheese plate, but it was wonderful.  The garlic bread was also a great choice.  

For my meal I ordered the bolognese based on some of the reviews on here.  It was probably the best pasta dish I have ever had.  You could tell the pasta was house made and very fresh.  The texture was different than any other pasta I've had.  On top of that, the bolognese sauce was incredible.

Can't wait to come back and try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Two piece and a biscuit! 
    My partner and I decided to dine at Pino this evening as we live nearby and heard some really nice things about the restaurant. My partner called ahead at around five pm and made a reservation for eight o'clock. Arriving on time we were left standing at the hostess stand for nearly fifteen minutes before someone came to seat us. While waiting the female bartender asked if there was anything we would like from the bar. We decided on two light beers.
   The server was nice, however we waited for at least ten minutes for the bread plate to come out, and awhile longer for the calamari, salad and finally the main course. My partners' plate had to be sent back due to it being practically raw, when he requested well done. 
   After nearly two hours ( 1:40min) we were more than finished and eager to go home. On the way out the bar tender called out in a husky voice \"sir, you forgot to pay your beer tab.\" The service was slow and not very hospitable. The plate, the steak was delicious. Unfortunately my partners was less than mediocre. 
   Unfortunately we will not return to Pino any time soon due to our experience. If you decide to try Pino then I suggest arriving ten minutes late and eat an appetizer before you get there...."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with above average food. This restaurant has a lot of potential. The wait staff was far below average: They were slow, and we had to ask multiple times for things. They were not the most polite wait staff, and our waitress was either a little demeaning or very socially awkward."}
{"text":"Bland food and poor service. Its a shame since it's a great location and could be much more, especially since there is always overflow from nearby point brugge."}
{"text":"We went to Pino's last night for dinner and everything from the service to the food was extraordinary. We recently visited Italy and I could not help but think I was back there while dining last evening. The food was immaculate and the pasta was perfectly cooked, just like they cook it in Italy. You could tell it was all homemade. The staff was friendly and welcoming. We will absolutely be going back. I wish I could  give more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"It took over 40 minutes for the food to come out and when it did, one entree, a Marlin dish, was severely undercooked."}
{"text":"Stopped in without a reservation around 7 pm. I ordered the house soup. It was very yummy. The soup was a tomato based soup with noodles and chick peas. I also tried the sausage flatbread. The flatbread sizing easily fed one. My boyfriend shared with me. The tomato sauce and peppers on it really made the flatbread. 

I really one to come back int the summer when the front windows are opened and enjoy some wine and small dishesa"}
{"text":"I ate here this past Friday with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  We decided to come here because it was Pittsburgh restaurant week and they offered a special 3 course $30 fixed price menu with 2 course wine pairing for $12.  It ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of Point Breeze which I had been past many times previously but never really noticed.

The restaurant was swamped whenever we got there, probably due to a combination of it being Friday night and restaurant week, so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  I decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque.  My salad was good and came with goat cheese, pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely.  It was nothing amazing but I think it takes a really special salad to be amazing.  I also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomato-y since I do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it.  For my entree I decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos.  The tacos were a bit sloppy/wet but had some nice flavors (cilantro, aoili and pico) in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick.  My mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good.  There was an adequate amount of cheese throughout and I liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish.  I was also able to try the Arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered.  Wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too.  Immediately I regretted not ordering it although I still did enjoy my two small plates.  For my dessert course I ended up having the White Chocolate Creme Brulee.  My girlfriend decided upon the tiramisu while another at our table had the peaches and puff pastry.  All of the desserts seemed large and made sure that we did not go home hungry!  My creme brulee tasted decently and ended up being a good finish to my meal.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Their regular menu seemed reasonably priced and everything that I had tried throughout the night was good."}
{"text":"My two friends and I had a bad experience here.

Short version: despite legitimate out-of-state identification, my two friends and I were denied service by the owner who acted inappropriately and very unprofessional. Offended; will not be returning.

Longer version:
While we were waiting for our table at a busy nearby restaurant to free up, we wandered over to Pino's and thought we'd sit for a glass of wine. We were welcomed in, and we took a seat at the bar. The three of us are recent college graduates, and we presented our out-of-state ID's to the bartender. The bartender examined mine closely, and then took it across to the other side of the bar and handed it to a group of people sitting and drinking wine. I was confused, but shrugged it off as I settled in.

The group passed my I.d. among them and were chatting gaily. The bartender returned to me a moment later and told me that \"she\" [one of the ladies among the group] wanted to talk to me. I imagined the owner had to be among them, and I good-naturedly approached the group. We made some jokes about my young age, and it went on like this until my friends came over to join the discussion. 

We eventually identified (who I believe was) the owner among the crowd, who communicated to us that she would be held responsible were anything to happen to us or anyone around us within so many hours after we were served, etc. We realized (not that the owner ever told us this explicitly) that we were being denied service, despite being 24 year old adults with legitimate identification. My friends and I were offended, and we left shaken (not that we would let any of that ruin our night).

To be denied service, I understand; but I am very disappointed in how the owner handled the situation:
First, she had no business passing my ID among her friends. If she wished to deny me service, rather than have me come to her across the bar, she would have been more professional to have come to me, identify herself as the owner, and discuss privately her concerns about serving out of state IDs. Second, instead of going on about why she was so uncomfortable with the situation I was putting her in, she should have told me explicitly and in a forward manner than she was choosing to refuse me service.

Finally, her refusal to serve me displays clearly that she is not interested in my business - for I am sure that it is not difficult for a business owner to get a hold of a book of state ID's (with identifying characteristics by year etc.).

I will not be returning."}
{"text":"So as another diner commented that reviews should be left by people who have dined here more then once, I will take him up on that.  I have been here at least 15-20 times in the past year.  I come early with my family for sure as we live nearby.  I honestly think people might be willing to cut it some slack if it weren't so expensive for the food he is serving.  But nonetheless we enjoy our time here and have grown used to less then enthusiastic service.  Mind you the servers are friendly but even after coming again and again, we have to wave upon entry at the servers seated all together in back to get someone to seat us OR to order something or get a check.  The place is good for locals but I wouldn't honestly travel any distance or out of the way to come here because its just .. good.  Take that any way you want.  I wish the take away pizzas were available to order in because he has some great pizza for take-away.  Honestly!! If you are living nearby give it a chance."}
{"text":"The good: the front of house staff was friendly.

The bad: the boscaiola, which came recommended, and was $22, was comprised of flavorless button mushrooms in hot water over noodles, with too much salt. The flank steak, $24, was wholly forgettable. Maybe we had unreasonable expectations, but I have had lean cuisines with more culinarily intrigue than the meal we just ate."}
{"text":"Great service great food.  You will meet the head chef.  He delivered several meals that he created.  Pasta and bread from scratch.  Creative wine list.  Creative mixed drinks.  Wonderful space.  I would highly recommend this place for a nice AUTHENTIC Italian dinner.  Every meal I saw come out looked amazing.  Hurry up and get here.  Yummy."}
{"text":"Would definitely come back! Was very impressed by the menu choices. Came here for restaurant week. I enjoyed every last bit of each course. It's definitely pricey, but I'd say well worth it! Staff was attentive and food came out at a reasonable time (I read previous reviews that said they waited, I did not have this experience). Was very pleased and will be back!"}
{"text":"Pino's appears to fashion itself something of a nouveau-Italian, smart casual neighborhood restaurant, and it's literally just that. Translation: the menu is uninspired and predictable. A relatively encompassing selection of appetizers and entrees revealed not quite a soul-crushing, but certainly a lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients, recipes and presentation, though the service was refreshingly excellent. Unfortunately, the only other reason you'd be dining in Point Breeze would be to enjoy the amazing Point Brugge Cafe just down the street. As a previous reviewer mentioned, I stopped in simply because the Brugge was full, but I unfortunately won't be making that mistake again."}
{"text":"The food was good. The pasta is made fresh. The ambiance wasn't very cozy. Even though you are packed together and the tables are small, it really didn't match the menu which is Primarily Italian. Our server was busy when we first got there so we waited patiently. However, as the dinner went on and it was only us and 2 other tables, she didn't clean off the table once, refill our drinks, got an order wrong (it drives me nuts when servers don't write orders down on paper). Again the food was delicious but everything else didn't fit."}
{"text":"This was honestly the best pasta I have ever had. Located near shady side it is a cute little restaurant with only about 15 tables, so make a reservation if you come on a weekend night. Happy Hour is 4-7 and had $1 off wines and some great beer options.

We stared with a cheeseplate and garlic bread for our appetizers. Wow both were amazing! The cheeseplate had 4 different cheese, candied nuts, a jam and crustinis. The garlic bread had so much flavor and was cooked to perfection.

Now onto the pasta. I really cannot put into words how good this pasta was. The noodles are homemade daily. I got the marinara pasta while my husband got the bolognese. The noodles were thick and doughy, and the sauce had a nice thick consistency. The flavor even had a tiny bit of a pepper taste which I love. The portion was a great size too.

Service was friendly and quick. She answered my million questions and gave a good recommendation when I asked about what noodle to get.

We left happy as could be. This place is a great date night spot! We cannot wait to come back and try the pizza."}
{"text":"The food and the atmosphere here were nice.  I love the location and it was just a cozy place. I took my husband for his birthday. The service, however, pretty much ruined our dinner.  We seemed to have 2 waitresses, both acting like they were only helping the other out occasionally, neither of them actually our dedicated waitress.  I ordered the broccoli soup, which came cold. Then sat in front of me for 15 minutes before someone came to check on us.  Finally the waitress came and asked me about it and I told her I didn't not want it warmed up as it now seemed unappetizing to me from trying to eat it cold.  (This is what ruined the night) she snapped it off the table and walked away from us without a word.  I was left feeling embarrassed that I did something wrong? She would not make eye contact with us the rest of the meal.  30 plus minutes later our dinner came out, pizza and pasta which was very good, and hot.  We were offered a 25 dollar gift card before leaving because obviously the owner knew something was up. We may go back again being that the food was good. But the service turned me off big time"}
{"text":"BEFORE Pino's was renovated, it was a tiny, unpretentious, hole-in-the-wall restaurant with a friendly atmosphere, and amazing Italian food. It was also a BYOB, which I love. This was our \"go-to\" restaurant.

AFTER Pino's was renovated, there was a complete transformation. While the interior is now very nice, It's no longer a BYOB, and the staff is full of attitude, which seems to stem from the total arrogance of Pino himself.

On our most recent visit, we were a party of four with reservations at 7:30 PM. We arrived at 7:25, and weren't even acknowledged until 7:40 PM. Pino was playing maitre d', and when he finally acknowledged our presence he seemed totally clueless and was overtly UN-apologetic. There were no open tables, despite having reservations. When 8:00 PM rolled around, I was frantically calling other local restaurants to see if we could get in. No such luck, since it was prime dining time on Saturday night. Finally, around 8:30 PM, the waitstaff brought a two person table up from the basement, crowded four chairs around it and jammed it into the middle of the restaurant for us to sit in. Pino then literally threw our menu's at us, and walked away. Not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience.

The food is still good here, but I refuse to give my money to someone who CLEARLY does not appreciate your business. There are SO many good restaurants in the area, with owners/chefs who are happy to have you. Next time you think about going here, walk an extra block to the Point Brugge Cafe."}
{"text":"Three of us had dinner at Pino's on a Friday night because we mistakenly assumed we'd be able to get seats at Point Brugges.  Having walked, we didn't have many other options, so we headed into Pino's (albeit a tad underdressed).

The food was all pretty good--one of my companions had the chicken and risotto, and the chicken was tasty but the risotto was creamy only from the addition of fat, and not from released starches...I had the casareccia as arrabiata is my favorite sauce.  The pasta itself was tasty (and homemade as the name implies), but the sauce lacked the signature spice of arrabiata. For $25 for a bowl of pasta, I expect much, much more.

Bottom line--you won't be disappointed by the food, but when the check comes, you'll feel you have overpaid. Ambiance does not match the prices, but the happy hour deal (half off wine) might be worthwhile."}
{"text":"Pino's...Glad we got the salads! 

It wasn't good, it wasn't bad. The environment of Pino's is awesome. It's a cool little place. It has a beautiful ceiling in the restaurant, great little street it's on, etc. 

The service was great. Our server was on her game and got us our drinks quickly and they were great. Their happy hour drink pricing isn't bad at all, so that's worth checking out.

We wanted to try a few different things as the plates that were passing by looked great. We opted to try the baked olives and the \"side\" of the Italian fries. Olives aren't really my things, but my girl loves them. She really enjoyed them. The Italian Fries were great. I loved the fried garlic and the herbs that were mixed in with them. They were awesome. The aioli which came with them was good but again. It my thing.

We both had a salad, I the house salad and she the arugula salad. The house salad was nice, the veggies crisp with a good vinaigrette. The arugula salad was similar with mozzarella balls(not homemade, at least they didn't taste as such) with tomatoes and a balsamic dressing.

Entree's were up next. I ordered the Margherita Pizza and she ordered the Sunday Sugo. I noticed their pizzas passing by and on other tables and they looked excellent...

Our entrees arrived and the disappointment overtook us rapidly. The Sunday Sugo was everything she expected it not to be. A large slice of pork and a large slice of beef. The menu doesn't clarify this. It just says \"slow braised beef and pork shoulder ragout.\" The expectation was it would have been almost shredded. She was disappointed so we chose to swap. She took the pizza and I the Sunday Sugo. 

I like pork and beef, love pastas..but this..it just wasn't good. The beef was the best part, as were the noodles. The sauce had absolutely no flavor. It was boring. I need some herbs, some garlic, something else. The pork had more fat on it than actual meat. It didn't really even taste like tomato sauce. A jar of Ragu actually has more flavor. At least it taste like tomatoes. Incredibly disappointing.

The pizza, again, disappointing. It was a crispy cracker, over cooked and absolutely flavorless. The parmesan sprinkle that was offered seemed like
It came out of a canister of Kraft Parmesan. The sauce was border line dried out. Interestingly enough, other pizzas looked great.

We passed on dessert, obviously."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious. We had pizza, pasta, salads and wine, and all were top notch. The location and setting are both charming, would be a lovely spot for a date night. I would have given the restaurant a higher rating, except that the chef was so rude to us. Just a couple of minutes after we paid the check, when we were relaxing and chatting, the chef came over and gave us a huge guilt trip about how there were people waiting for tables, practically kicking us out of the restaurant. The hostess loudly complained as we were walking out about other people who had left because they didn't have tables available, and about us \"finally\" leaving (she even ran out onto the street to try and track the people down). It couldn't have been more than *5 minutes* from the time we paid the check until the time we left. I've never experienced such inhospitality at an otherwise friendly neighborhood restaurant. I hope they improve their attitude towards diners, because otherwise, it would have been a 4 or 5-star experience."}
{"text":"It's a shame that some of the other reviewers had poor experiences. I discovered Pino's after deciding that the wait for Point Brugge simply wasn't worth it.

The brunch was very good, I enjoyed the atmosphere, particularly the \"missing\" wall which gives the appearance of outdoor seating, and particularly liked not having to sit shoulder-to-shoulder with other people.

My sole comment would be that the owner, who was very friendly, should let his food speak for itself rather than being so concerned about the neighborhood competition."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food, very friendly service, knowledgeable sommelier to help with wine choices . Food was great , interesting wine list, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant was honestly incredible. I got the Bellagio pasta and it was amazing. I also got the Pasta and Ceci soup which I really enjoyed. The Shirley temple was okay, the cherries tasted like water, but overall can't complain about the food.
The service is where I have an issue with this restaurant and the sole reason why I won't be returning. When we first sat, our server seemed nice. I asked how large the pasta servings were, and she said \"you're skinny, so it'll be too much for you.\" This was... rude to say the least. I am not a 00, but it didn't seem necessary to make a comment like that when I just wanted to know how much pasta I was getting. 
Secondly, I ordered my soup along with my drink. Other people in my party ordered the calamari, and got it almost right away. I kept thinking my soup would be coming, but when they brought out the main dishes, I asked the server. She just said, \"my mistake. I'll bring it.\" And was gone. After everyone at my table had finished the meal, my soup was brought out with no apology whatsoever.
At the end of the meal, I saw that I was charged in full for my soup, which was still billed as an appetizer. I found this weird, because I thought it would have been appropriate for the server (or manager!) to offer a discount or for the soup to be on the house. So, I decided to ask if i could get some money off. The waitress gave me the dirtiest look and said \"well... you ate it.\" No, I inhaled it after it was extremely late. So she said \"I mean, I could take off like... a dollar or two. But it's only a dollar so...\" I said, \"so you can't?\" And she said, \"well, it'll be a dollar or two.\" So I said thank you, and she returned the new check and made sure to make a scene and announce to my entire table that we were receiving a new check.
Also, I heard her talking about my party on the phone; she seemed to be complaining about the size of our party and wasn't sure how we were going to be paying, when she easily could have asked us how we were paying.
Overall, great food, and it seemed that most people reviewing didn't have such a bad experience with the service."}
{"text":"We stopped in without a reservation and were squeezed in. The server was very accomdating to my severe dairy allergy. She went back and checked with the chef twice to ensure I ordered the correct items. I thought it was lovely."}
{"text":"The fresh-baked bread and sun-dried tomato puree is outstanding. We started with the crab cakes, which was one of the lightest I've had. I could eat a vat of the lemon aioli itself. We followed with veal and ricotta meatballs that were perfectly cooked. We finished with their Italian fries. I would order these every single time now that I've had them once. Twice cooked, herbs, garlic confit, basil aioli--every single element of the dish is fantastic.

If you plan on visiting, then make sure you have some time to really take in the drink list and menu. There are always a handful of new, recommended wines to try and a signature cocktail of the week (which, might I add, is usually extremely fun and concocted with unique ingredients). I am impressed with the cleanliness, decor, and ambiance of the restaurant. I love the feel when the French doors are completely open. 

I also enjoyed our bartender, Eamonn, who was funny, polite, and attentive. He is also a master of not only creating fresh, new, tasty cocktails but, simply, understands the right way to mix and serve a drink.

Overall, I would love to keep Pino's as our little secret but would urge you to try it too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our one year wedding anniversary this past weekend and since we recently have moved into a new area of town, we made reservations here because word on the street was that it was good. Verdict? It was so-so. We had reservations at 7:15 and were seated promptly, which was fine, except we were seated OUTSIDE! Listen folks, it's COLD when the sun goes down. They have three tables set outside, I guess trying to squeeze out some more business. Our server was nice, but not attentive at all.  We were left waiting for things for 10-20 minutes at a time. Also, because we were sitting on the sidewalk, people and animals and cars kept sweeping by us. It took the waiter three tries to get our meal order because he had to keep stepping out of the way of people walking down the street. Wine was good. Food was ehhhhhh. We had the mussel and clam appetizer and when it came out, about 1/2 of the order was not edible and all the innards had fallen into the sauce, which by the way smelled like stinky cheese. My dinner and my husbands dinner was good, no real complaints there. Espresso and a S'more cupcake for dessert and I grand total of $134 later before tip? Definitely not worth it at all.  The best part of the night? Leaving. The worst part of the night? Associating this place with my anniversary."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Pino's for restaurant week. We ordered two items specifically not on their main menu - the eggplant rollatini and the rustic cod (both came with a salad and dessert due to restaurant week). Both meals were really good! My rollatini could have had a little more seasoning with the sauce, but I would definitely get it again (I cleared my plate) - and my husband really liked the rustic cod option. 

We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat while in Pittsburgh. If your in the shady side area or Bakery Square area this is one of the place you need to check out. Great service..great food..great people."}
{"text":"My family recently relocated to Pittsburgh from NYC and planned a private Sunday event at Pino's after recommendations from friends. I am so glad that we did! It was a perfect day- Jen was extremely easy to work with on thinking through all of the details- coming up with a unique menu for food and wine, while helping to not let the cost get out of control.  Joe was helpful when we dropped off decorations the day before the event, and he came out once the food was out to check on everything. The space was perfect for a party of 40 people with a handful of kids and babies. The food was very fresh and all perfectly cooked to serve the large group at once- not an easy task. We had guests from all over, and I keep getting calls on how great the food was and how nice the owners are. I would definitely recommend working with Jen and Joe to anyone for an event. I can't wait to go back for dinner and try some additional things on their menu."}
{"text":"Went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition. 

We were one of two tables there and a bunch of staff showing up during the meal. 

Our waitress was good, but that couldn't save the food.

The meal started out with some what I guess used to be foccacia.  I say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very stale and tasteless.

We ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces. 

Then we ordered the octopus which was fine, but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor, being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish. 

The tuscan wings were ok, but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them. 

Finally the diver scallops.  This dish was indeible.  The scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty I was unable to eat it. We sent it back and they did take off half of the price (weren't expecting anything just didn't want to eat it). 

After that we decided against dessert and left.  I probably will not return."}
{"text":"In similar fashion to Joseph S. I, too, decided to give Pino's a shot once we saw how packed nearby Point Brugge, which had initially drawn our party due to its reputation, was. It was a relatively nice evening, and I thought the concept of fresh-air dining was too good to pass us by. We were immediately greeted by Jen, one of the co-owners, as we entered. I made it a point to compliment the beautiful inlaid tile in our tabletop, and she volunteered some additional information about their production that I found to be very interesting. 

I really loved the bistro burger. I requested it to be prepared \"Medium\", and sure enough it lived up to my expectations---you'd be surprised how many times I've ordered a medium burger only to have it served well-done and nearly bone-dry at other restaurants. Nicole, our waitress, proved her weight in gold when she reassured me that gorgonzola would be a good cheese to accompany the bacon on the burger. We also ordered the macaroni & cheese as an appetizer. I thought the ziti was a bit dry, but the sauce and cheese were delicious. We really loved the bread and the garlic butter spread. I was hoping for an oil & vinegar blend to have with the bread, but the spread served as a surprisingly tasty alternative. My partner's ravioli looked delicious, and he let me try one of his meatballs, which I found to have that \"homemade\" flavor that's difficult to find at many restaurants. Our friend loved her arugula salad, and as a seafood aficionado I was impressed by the very generous size of the shrimp she had. Our service was prompt---our water glasses had barely gone half-empty before our waitress scurried over to replenish them. 

Overall we loved our experience and WILL be back! We were told about Pino's legendary Sunday brunches, and I look forward to trying one myself the next Sunday I have off from work."}
{"text":"Service is a little lacking and the time it takes to get your food is sometimes a little ridiculous, but to tell the honest truth. It's worth the wait because the Sunday Sugo is incredible and one of the best Italian dishes I've had."}
{"text":"Pinos offers an unhappy marriage of good food at bad prices.  The food is tasty but not transcendent.  The prices in the high $20's for most of the entrees are not justified by the quality, location, or portions.  The food is essentially slightly hipper Olive Garden fare at double the prices.

For dinner entrees you can get more for your money elsewhere.  But it's not all bad.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the service was excellent.  I had a good time and I'd happily go back for appetizers (most are $8-10).

Pino's is frequented by a large rambunctious flock of malbec massacring 40-50 year old women.  My friend and I were the only males there.  If cougar hunting is your sport of choice, you'll feel right at home in Pino's jungle safari!"}
{"text":"I like this place so much! Unpretentious. Everything is made from scratch. Service is amazing. Lots of small plates. Great wine deals... Definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"I've been told several times that this place had a great brunch.  Upon arrival, the menu was very limited and the service was abysmal despite a nearly empty restaurant.  We literally waited 15 mins. at our table and then left prior to ordering."}
