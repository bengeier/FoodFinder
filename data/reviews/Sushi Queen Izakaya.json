{"text":"Terrible.... food was really salty. Horrible service, I asked the waitress for some change she threw it on the table and it landed on the floor and she just walked away..... Totally rude!!!!! Would not come back!!!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi/sashimi - my go-to for take out. 

The restaurant definitely lacks ambiance, but I really enjoy their sushi and sashimi. Always seems fresh. I always do take-out here. They are very quick when I call in my order, and the 10% pick up discount when you spend over $10 is an added bonus. Large menu with a number of izakaya items. I usually stick to the Sashimi Queen St -12 pieces plus soup, salad, rice...all for $10.95."}
{"text":"If you want all you can eat sushi in the core of downtown  this place is very convenient. The food there is ok but nothing special. I did like that the menu and ordering system was done with an iPad. On our first order the restaurant forgot to bring out many of of dishes so we had to order them again. This is bad service if guests order food and the kitchen does not bring it out."}
{"text":"I work down the street from this place. They are always friendly and accommodating such as taking my order over the phone and starting it so when I leave work its their waiting for me. Good quality food, definitely better that an all you can eat place. They have a  nice patio too and I really like the automatic doors and clean washrooms. The only thing I have against it is how dark is can be inside some time, seems to lack that ambience, otherwise I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Relative to their nicely-made website and nice-looking decor, I was surprised at their averagely-priced menu. I easily ordered 5 different rolls last time, about 45 pieces altogether, for about $40 - an average price for a small sushi boat. 

2 of the rolls were from their special menu, namely Calla Roll and Guma Roll. Unfortunately both of them cheaped-out, differed from their picture on the menu. (Perhaps it's because the main sushi chef wasn't there. I know some sushi restaurants can improve by miles away depending on which chef is behind the sushi bar, but then that would turn into a consistency issue. Back to the topic.) Instead of having smoked salmon wrapping most of the roll as depicted, the actual Calla Roll only had the top part layered. Next, Guma roll is a vegetarian roll, supposedly nicely covered with spinach leaves, but mine was sprinkled with chopped spinach leaves and stems. I obviously needed some extra effort to chew down the cellulose in the stems. Other than the discrepancies from their advertisement, the food was ok, rolls were averagely sized. The other rolls I order were Gold Dragon, Toronto Roll and Spicy Tuna - the usual stuff. Should you wish to pay a visit here, I would still suggest you to go for their special menu because the food there is 

Service was exactly what one would expect from servers of \"my own people\". Friendliness and attentiveness of this category of servers varies according to the time of the day and their mood of the moment and they don't quite bother hiding it. They're not the worst, just don't expect them to be cheerful, delightful who will make you feel like your business is appreciated, then you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Never eating here again.  The food tasted bland and warm, and fruit flies came out of the salad - in April - which didn't inspire us to believe the kitchen was very clean.  When I asked for plain tap water they brought me water with ginger in it instead.  Neither my friend nor I finished our disgusting food, and the bill was exorbitant.  Don't go here."}
{"text":"I brought my business here no less than twice in two days. I thought the typically Toronto surly service on the first day was just a misstep. The second day I received quite possibly the rudest treatment I have ever had in Toronto. Outrageous, for sushi that is ok in an area that is overrun with sushi joints. DONE. Never again. Boo."}
{"text":"Unlike many reviewers, I really enjoyed eating here! 

The decor is really nice, they plate each dish beautifully, the service is fast and friendly, portions are generous, and it's also incredibly cheap. The $3 tempura plate comes with about 6 very large battered vegetables (eggplant, sweet potato, broccoli). You can get 5 dumplings for $3. Sushi rolls are jam-packed.  Six pieces cost about $3.50. 

I also thought it was a great spot for vegetarians: the appetizer menu has miso soup; a few different salads, grilled tofu dishes; grilled vegetable dishes; vegetable tempura; sauteed vegetables, etc.; and the vegetarian sushi options included mushroom; spinach, sweet potato and avocado; avocado; cucumber; sweet potato; tofu. 

My meal cost about $7. If you order before 5 p.m., you get a 20% discount."}
{"text":"Sushi Queen Izakaya is great bang for your buck.  It's my go-to restaurant, and is definitely the best mid-end sushi in the area.    

Their a la carte has reasonable prices for reasonable quality.  I usually get salmon sashimi and BBQ eel rolls.  I am addicted to the sauce that comes with the tuna and avocado salad.  The fried chicken wings are also surprisingly good, they have that magical Asian take-out flavour and are always super juicy.    

Their AYCE is $32 with tax every day, including weekends.  The selection is quite large and service is fairly quick.  Get the salmon and avocado salad!   

You can call ahead or use Just Eat to get take-out or delivery, if you walk-in to do take-out it's pretty fast but not suspiciously fast."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot. Service was OK. Great value. Nice interior. Good location. Patio looks huge. Never very busy."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss. Overall, I'd describe the quality of food as mediocre, and the quality of service below average. In my opinion, there are several better choices for this type of food in about a 200m radius of this place.

On the plus side, the place is large, the wait times are low, and they're very quick in preparing food when you order for takeout."}
{"text":"Ordered Katsu Don, Salmon teriyaki and the enoki mushroom beef roll. If you are hoping to reminisce airline economy quality food, this is the place to go to. Do be prepared to be disappointed that Air Canada will have better food than here though. 

Oh and don't get me started on the unfriendly lady server. Felt like I owed her a fortune"}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant in the city.  Amazing menu items (Savvy Q, Yokohama roll, Spicy Tuna Chips), great presentation, and cool staff.  Loved the restaurant, food and the PRICE!  Place is a serious steal with a nice decor to match."}
{"text":"Waited 85 minutes for delivery that was supposed to be 45. Called twice. Finally they say that they just sent the food out and it should be another 40 minutes. It should not take over 2 hours to have sushi delivered (it's a 6 minute drive away)!! They offered no compensation, and didn't really apologize. Just made excuses saying that they're busy. Will never order again- do NOT recommend for delivery."}
{"text":"Visited for dinner with a co-worker. Been there several times for lunches couple years back and haven't have much success but I thought I would give another try. 
Once again, the food was meh. The service has improved, but because of the quality of food, I am not sure if I would ever go back. It's not like it is not edible, but it just isn't above average."}
{"text":"Poor service! One older waitress did not seat us right away, even if there were tables available.  I asked her 'how about those tables?' she said 'they are for 6 people!'.  Mind you, the tables could be separated to accommodate 4 and 2 ppl separately.  Then, by some miracle she came to her senses; she dropped the menus on the available table, which she said was for '6 ppl', and pointed to it as she passed in front of us to say we could just sit there! Such a rude cow and kept being one until the end of our meal!  Saving factor for this place were the nice younger waitresses and good food! Will I come back or recommend to other people!  Not at this time!"}
{"text":"We were looking(me and my friend) for another sushi restaurant in the area when we came across this restaurant, and we decided to check it out. The restaurant is nice and clean and surprisingly quiet. The menu has variety of options and selections to choose from and the food is good and decent for the price you're paying. 

However, the service level here is very bad at this restaurant and definitely needs improvement. 

The waiter, was very short with us when we wanted to order and brought the soup and salad after a long time. As soon as we started with the appetizers, he brought the main food and took the appetizers away without asking us, it happened so sudden that we didn't even get to question it..we said it's fine the main dish is here anyways. 
Then he forgot to bring us our deserts and we had to ask him twice to get it...and finally when we asked for the bill, he disappeared. So we had to go directly to the counter and get the bill and pay right at the counter. 

I'm not sure what was going on with the waiter but that was not a good service. 

The food overall was good so I might go back again but the waiters definitely need to improve their level of customer service."}
{"text":"This is a review of the all you can eat option (AYCE for you acronym lovers).

Sashimi (4/5): sashimi is the most important part of AYCE sushi - secretly we all want to believe that as a cost benefit analysis, we are costing the restaurant money due to the sheer amount of sashimi we can ingest. In return, we want sashimi to be fresh, and plentiful. Some sashimi is easy to make good - most salmon is terrific. Some sashimi is harder - good surf clam is not easy to find.  The sashimi here is high quality through and through. The one thing that could be better is that there is no red tuna.

Sushi (4/5) Nigiri, Maki, and Hand Rolls.  Most important for me are the quality of rice and ratio of topping to rice. The rice is always soft with a touché of sweetness - I have never had bad rice here. The hand rolls would be 5/5 for sure based on the stuffing to rice ratio.  The maki gets a 5/5 too - there are creative options and also all the classics too, presented nicely.  The dynamite rolls come warm because of the freshly fried shrimp tempura (the all-important mark of a good dynamite rolls!). Nigiri gets a 3/5 because, sadly, the rice to fish ratio is not as good as it might be.  This is not a huge insult as you would still find it at par with other restaurants. 

Appetizers (4/5): I have had many appetizers and in broad strokes will say that they range from average (eg tempura) to excellent (eh the izikaya is especially tender), to downright bizarre (eh balsamic salmon).  A cool selection and worth trying new things!

Ambiance (4/5): as far as AYCE sushi places go this one has decent service speed and the food usually comes in a good amount of time with very few screw ups in the order of at all.  The place is large, usually quiet, and the washrooms are of good quality (and much better than many other sushi places I have been to!).  There is also a patio which makes for a nice option.

Bottom line: one of the better sushi places in the city especially for the AYCE option. Worth walking 20 minutes or taking a short subway ride."}
{"text":"If you are looking for any kind of decent service - this place is not for you. It took 10 minutes to even be given menus and asked for our drink orders. The restaurant was relatively empty, yet we waited for ages and were served cold green tea (half the table were not given drinks at all) and cold edamame. 

The sushi rolls themselves were pretty good but unfortunately did not make up for everything else this restaurants lacks."}
{"text":"Pretty decent sushi at a reasonable price for downtown TO. It's a shame that it's delivered by the most disgruntled delivery men of all time. I had one scowl at me for giving him a $5 tip. I mean what more does he want? A rub and tug over some miso soup? Get a grip pal, you're in the service industry, not me."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Terrible food. Forced me to pay 15% tip. Don't come even if you are starving to death."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend. We asked each other at \"what's the catch\" at the prices, but apparently there was none - the sashimi and rolls were basic, but good. 

Not spectacular but if you're looking for decent sushi in the area this is above other places at this price point that I've tried."}
{"text":"Are you hunting for a cheap bento lunch around the Eaton Center?
If you are... then this is the place for you!

...I still love Japango, but sometimes it's hard to get a table there during lunch hour.  Sushi Queen Izakaya has lots of seating and we didn't have to line up.

I was very surprised by the menu.  It's MASSIVE and pretty creative!

They have all kinds of specialty rolls and izakaya items.  They even have some sort of sushi hamburger.

The lunch specials are cheap (around 10 bucks)  and you get lots of food.  The sushi and sashimi combo I ordered was very fresh and tasty. 

The takoyaki was ...passable... but I wouldn't order it again here.

My one complaint is the freaking-way-too-slow service.
It's lunch time in the core...Learn to serve quicker and move people through.  People have to get back to work. 

We found that we were waiting a damn long time for everything.

I'm sure I'll be back to try some of the other dishes.
They have so much to choose from, you can come here every week and try something new!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to this place because it seemed pretty clean and it was close by.

Bad, bad idea. For one, we were one of the few tables that were seated during the lunch period -- why did my friends meals take 20 minutes to arrive, and my meal 15 more minutes to arrive? 

My dining experience too had a hair in the sushi -- apparently, not the first case at Sushi Queen Izakaya based of of the reviews here on Yelp. Fortunately, the waitress was much more accommodating then the other posters.

Still, for the quality of their food compared to their prices, the wait times, and the random short black hairs that pop up in people's food here, I'm going to say that there are other establishments that are more deserving of our money.

For a full review with pictures (not of the hair, don't want anyone to feel unpleasant :P) please look at my blog, located conveniently in my profile!"}
{"text":"I've been a semi-regular at Sushi Queen Izakaya for about a year now and I would have given them a 3.5/5. Their fish is typically fresh (except one time when it really wasn't), and their AYCE is okay (they make customers share the iPads: you order, they come and confirm, and then take it away from you for a very long time).

But their customer service has always left kind of a bad taste in my mouth. I usually order take-away in order to avoid their customer service, but even their phone etiquette is TERRIBLE.

Tonight was no exception, and it was the worst ever. There is a good chance I'll never come back again, and I'll make sure everyone I know knows they are terrible.

I called at 7:30pm on a Monday to order 1 bento box. The lady on the other line was brash and loud: she seemed to be yelling at me over the phone and trying to cut me off as soon as she picked up. I placed an order for the bento box and she said: \"Is that all?\"
I replied: \"Yes, that's all.\"
She said: \"Okay.\" and promptly hung up on me without even so much as telling me how long it would take.

I was stunned. I then called back to see how long my order would take. I began by saying, \"Hi, I just called here...\" and she cut me off and said: \"Yeah, I know you just ordered bento.\" (seemingly annoyed that I called back). To which I replied, \"Yes, I did, but no one told me how long it would take.\"

Still annoyed at me, she yelled \"10 minutes\".  In response, I hung up on her.

I am waiting to pick up my food now and will pay (without tipping), but tomorrow I will be calling again to speak to the manager."}
{"text":"NOT A FAN.  My feeling is that we may have experienced the service we did because we presented a Teambuy certificate upon being seated by a rather brusque woman.  But if that's the case, why would these restaurants sign up for these deals?  And why oh why would they not try to impress since the customer is in the restaurant... so that, maybe... possibly... they could get the customers (who would then pay full price) to COME BACK?  I mean, isn't that the whole concept behind those deals??

Service was rushed and I felt the servers to be impatient.  The food runner attempted to place plates on top of other dishes on the table forcing us to quickly rearrange plates.  My husband and I were both convinced that the food runner would've left the plates right on top of other dishes which STILL HAD FOOD LEFT ON THEM.

And the food for the most part wasn't that great either.  Apart from the fried calamari, edamame and the chicken kara-age, the rest of the dishes we had were very disappointing.  True to izakaya style dining, we ordered a number of dishes to share, including the bbq mixed set (which had over-cooked skewers of chicken and seafood, and under-cooked, raw really, vegetable slices) and Korean style bbq ribs (which were tasteless).  I had a salmon and yellowtail handrolls where the fish pieces were not prepared properly because there were stringy pieces of fish in both handrolls.  Ick.

As the front area of the restaurant started to fill up, the formerly mentioned brusque woman cleared our table asking, \"Want anything else?\" She looked disappointed when we asked her for a dessert menu and she returned with the \"daily special\" sheet saying that they only had one dessert dish.  Seemed weird and we didn't want what looked like some sherbet thingy, so we asked for the bill and when it came, the Teambuy amount hadn't been deducted.  When we pointed it out to her, she replied in an irritated manner, \"Beer and tax needs to be paid\" and all she did was keep pointing at it until we asked her to provide us with a bill for it.  I'm not recounting this interaction that well, but it was really off-putting and can't remember the last time we had such a bad restaurant experience. 

There are too many better places and options in this city to bother with this one.  If you find yourself haunting the doorstep of Sushi Queen Izakaya, turn and run the other way as fast as you can!"}
{"text":"Redemption!!

Service was pleasant.  Mean, unhappy lady smiled and gave us free mango dessert custard!  Food was good as always, water and tea refilled every time it needed to be.  Added back to my list....hope they keep it up."}
{"text":"The service here is not great to say the least. I have been here a handful of times and it has always been very mediocre but I keep wanting to give it another chance. During my most recent visit time, the woman serving us was very abrupt and unpleasant. She never smiled or greeted us or checked on us. When she brought us waters, one glass was full with ice water and the other was half filled with room temperature water and no ice. When she came by to refill waters, she filled up mine but not my partner's, which was right next to mine and completely empty and he had asked for more. We also felt like she just dumped the plates on the table one at a time and walked away. 

We ordered an appetizer, two sushi rolls (my main) and a combo plate (salad, soup, roll, dessert). The main for my partner's main came before anything else, followed by the appetizer, followed my main of two rolls. It is only as I'm writing this review that I realize he was never given his dessert. The whole experience felt very jaded and disjointed as a dining experience. 

The young woman who cleared our plates and took our payment was friendly, though, and the food and prices are always good for what you get. I probably would not return here again after this visit."}
{"text":"Came here during the weekday lunch rush.  Greeted and seated instantly, ordered off the lunch special menu.  Friend got a sushi combo and I got some noodle dish.  Food arrived quickly with miso and salad.  For a basic Japanese meal - this is pretty good.  With tax and tip, it's under $10.  Much better than foodcourt food!  Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is right downstairs of my apt building so I visit there very often. Their appetizer, izakaya menu and chef's recommendation are what you should try, the dishes on these menu are really creative and visually appealing. I had different items every time I went there, and so far I like their oyster shooter, shima roll, bake oyster, monkfish livers and spicy hokkigai. I don't recommend the octopus ball though. Items on these menus are 20% off during 2-5PM everyday.
 
Other things like basic rolls and bentos are just ordinary. Also pick-up order over $15 before tax is 10% off."}
{"text":"I come very often to this place and I have never been disappointed. The decor is not great but really what sells here is the food. The menu is huge!! lots of options to choose from. I have tried both A la Carte and All you can eat and both offer great value for your money.
The fish is very fresh, presentation is amazing. I like that you can find the traditional sushi and also new modern combinations with non Japanese ingredients, is a very well balanced menu.
Price is always great. The only thing that they could improve is the costumer service as there some of the waitress are not especially friendly.
Anyways I will come back as the quality-price speak for itself!"}
{"text":"Absolutely was impressed with this place. It's hard to find really great sushi places in this city that make delicious and creative rolls. 

I ordered the Shimma Roll and the Salmon Fry both were totally amazing. When I got my bill it was mysteriously 20% off everything. 

The service was great and the food was amazing, I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Sushi Queen Izakaya has gone down in quality over the years ... portions definitely smaller than they used to be, but still a decent choice for cheap sushi.  I have a soft spot for that one surly waitress who tosses your food disdainfully down on the table while walking by.  I'm actually a little disappointed whenever she's not working, as she's an essential part of the local colour."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from here, but I think next time we'd order from Sushi on Bloor. The menu prices were about the same, and we didn't really order any izakaya appetizers. 

There's a good combo there for $13.95 that comes with a full tempura dish, gyoza, teriyaki beef/chicken/salmon, miso soup, rice, salad, and sushi/california rolls. It was HUGE and I'm impressed JP J. finished it. 

I got a $10.95 12 piece sashimi set, that comes with rice, miso and salad. Fish was decent tasting. Nothing stood out. 

I would have given this 4 stars, but I found that it took them over an hour to get the food. Perhaps another reason to get from Sushi on Bloor, depending on your location."}
{"text":"Ok so I need to say the following - 

I ate from here before reading the reviews (which had I read I probably would not have eaten from here)

I got a take away from here

The sushi was fine, well rolled, good size the sashimi good. Tempura was good...it was all decent in my opinion. Tasted fresh and was pretty cheap. I was happy, we were given drinks while we waited on our order and the staff were very friendly.

I would go there again."}
{"text":"A little pricey for my taste,but if you are hungry and want food now, give this place a shot.  We showed up after a few afternoon patio drinks and ordered all sorts of stuff.   I can't remember every item we ordered, but I do remember being please with every dish.

Very clean, very attentive staff.  The sushi tasted very fresh and flavorful.

Their warm sake makes my mouth water thinking about it."}
{"text":"This is my first review on yelp and I thought I would write it about my favourite sushi restaurant in TO! I go here all the time and it's always great. The best part about this place is the variety of unique sushi rolls etc. Try the Yokohama Roll, Avocado Ebi Cone and Sushi Sandwich- so good! The sushi is always fresh and they are always fast as well. The staff isn't the friendliest but all the good things about this place make up for it. I always walk an extra few blocks to go to this particular sushi place because it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Subpar sushi, not memorable sashimi, awful service."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner the other night with my boyfriend and another friend. It was one of those evenings after work where I just didn't want to cook and I was in the mood for sushi. I have walked by this place many times on my way home, but I have not tried. I have to say, I have been to better sushi places. The dinner menu is very big with lots of choices. But the food quality was not very good. I definitely have been to better sushi places. The pricing of their menu is average and the service was also \"okay\". The servers are nice, but, they are way too eager to clear the table - for instance, my friend wasn't able to finish her dish and shared the rest of her food with me and my boyfriend. While the food on our plates were finished, we were still eating. The server just came and took our plates and chopsticks away, we had to stop the server. Overall, this place would not really be my first choice for sushi."}
{"text":"So I've been dragged here several times by new coworkers since my last review and as a result, I have an updated review. The service is definitely hit and miss, more often miss. But the food is actually pretty good, especially the lunch specials! It's a lot of food for a good price and a good alternative on those days when you don't feel like squeezing into the shoebox that is Japango. They get pretty busy at lunch so the earlier you go, and the smaller your party, the faster and better your experience is likely to be!"}
{"text":"I like this place alot! I've been here for dinner 2 or 3 times and enjoyed it each time. The food is always fresh and yummy. Spring rolls and tempura are actually hot and crispy, not soggy and greasy, like in so many places. Great prices (I usually get the vegetarian bento box which is around $9 and there is ALOT of food. My husband usually gets the udon soup or noodles which is around $6 or $7). There's lots of booth seating. Nice, casual atmosphere. Service is usually very quick though the servers always seem a bit hesitant or nervous. It would be nice if they smiled a bit and were more welcoming. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"We came across this place from walking Around the hotel we were staying at for my best friends birthday( Sabrina! Haha) 

The venue is really cute, girly and pink! 

The waitresses take a while to check up on the tables especially after receiving your food. The menu is massive, lots of interesting new styles of rolls I haven't seen else where. 

It was pretty good price, both of our bills were below $25 and we got a lot of sushi! Hopefully I remember most of the roll names now. 

Friend ordered, spring rolls( comes in 5) calamari roll, green dragon roll( shrimp roll with avocado on top) and guma roll ( veggie roll, had cream cheese, spinach, asparagus and avocado) She loved Eveything except the guma roll. It tasted weird, the combo of veggies just didn't sit well together. 

I ordered, calamari roll, pink dragon roll( shrimp roll with fresh scallops on top) and vegetable bento box( 2 pieces of deep fried tofu, 2 spring rolls, vegetable tempura and 6 cucumber rolls) All of my food tasted good except the pink dragon. I have a weak gag reflux for smushy raw seafood smell so maybe that's why. 

I would come here again and try few other special house rolls and apps they have."}
{"text":"Great downtown sushi with an extremely user-friendly full-colour lunch menu. The service is good and the seating is comfortable. It's very busy and fast-paced during the weekday lunch rush, but I've been here twice and I've never felt any pressure to eat quickly. The food is very good and the prices are reasonable, especially given the location and the clientele."}
{"text":"BEST FOOD IN TO!  Love this place!  Couldn't believe how great the food was for the price :)  NEW FAV SPOT!"}
{"text":"Looking for affordable and yummy sushi option? Go here.

There's plenty of room. The ambience looks slightly upscale (ok I'm comparing to sushi places on Spadina). Service is friendly. Washrooms are clean!

The menu is weird. Is this sushi? an Izakaya? Oh wait, its both?

I've had their seafood kimchi, which is surprisingly good! I'm pretty boring when I go for sushi, I usually get the rainbow roll. One soup, appetizer and rainbow was enough to fill me. It came to ~$12 before tip, very reasonable. 

My friend got the bento box, which was a very generous serving.

I've been here twice now, and both times satisfied. If you are looking for a casual and affordable sushi spot near dundas square, this is a very safe bet."}
{"text":"Been here about 3 times now.  Each time I've had very little problems with this place.  For the first 2 times I've had the AYCE and just recently tried a bento.

All the sushi is as you'd expect at the pricepoint.  Average price, average sushi.  The rolls were pretty good but the sashimi was underwhelming.

The bento box was pretty filling and it was nice that it included ice cream.  $17 for a complete meal that left me pretty satisfied.  

Overall I'd give it a 3.5/5 :)"}
{"text":"I came here for some sushi to go so I could bring it on my bus trip.  I had a few errands to run, and ask if I can order and come back when it's ready.  I was told to come back in 10 minutes.

I returned 15 minutes later.  My food was not ready.  I had a seat and waited for my food.  After waiting for 25 minutes, I realized that I needed to leave for the bus station.  The person at the cash register did not remember me, and the staff had lost my order.  There was a lot of yelling in language I did not understand and I waited another 10 minutes.  I finally got my lunch after at least 35 minutes.

The food itself was delicious, but I almost missed my bus.  The miso was fresh and I could taste the bonito in it.  The salad was typical Japanese iceburg lettuce salad.  The meal, which was a sushi,nigiri and sashi mix, was amazing!  

I'm torn; the food here was terrific, but the service was lacking.  Had the staff offered me something in compensation, even a free soda, I would have given the restaurant a better review.  But waiting 35 minutes for take-out sushi when told the wait will be 10 is unacceptable in my view."}
{"text":"Do not order oysters... They were not fresh at all.

Sushi (a la carte) was average... Definitely used too much rice... Can't say I'll be back"}
{"text":"Had the all you can eat dinner on a week night, the sushi was good but service was terribly slow ! The head waitress had a terrible attitude and was just awfully slow!"}
{"text":"This is a cute sushi restaurant that I ended up visiting recently. The menu is quite overwhelming. I believe I ordered a Chef's special - the CN Tower one. My dinner companion ordered from the Sashimi combinations. I would lie if I said I remembered which one! There's the University one, the King St one, the Queen St one, etc! Both our sushi decisions were delicious.

There are so many options that I would return to taste others."}
{"text":"Delicious rolls. I got a bunch of house special rolls. The crispy calamari and BBQ eel rolls were my favourite. The price of each roll averaged to just under $5 (some a little more and some less). Very affordable and tasty food, beautiful ambiance and the staff were friendly and were always quick to refill water before my glass was empty. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Sometimes 4 stars, sometimes 2. Really inconsistent. But when they get it right, it's a good value for your money. (I prefer Mount Fugi around the corner, but they're more expensive.) I usually go with lunch special #6 with salmon. Not a fan of their salad dressing though, it's like a spicy dressing with lots of ginger and pepper. Miso soup is also sub-standard.  They're always packed during lunch but getting your food usually doesn't take too long. Waiting to pay, however, can take an eternity. Once, our waitress just left the debit machine on the table and took off, leaving the 4 of us to process our own debit transactions, lol. Guess we could have waited for her, but then we would have been late getting back to work. But because they are so busy, the food is always fresh. There are about 40 people in our office and no one has ever gotten sick from their raw fish (and our office eats a lot of sushi!) 

Not bad if you're in the area and want sushi (or if Mount Fuji is full)."}
{"text":"Definitely come here if you want to try crappy sushi.
We came here twice, once in 2010, and once in 2015. Both times it was horrible and everybody hated the food. If you want japanese food, go to japango, yuzu no hana, or saku sushi.

This place is horrid."}
{"text":"Okay sushi place.  Not your typical 'small sized' sushi restaurants but it seems spacious enough to host office lunches."}
{"text":"this is not the best sushi restaurant in the city, but it is good. the prices are reasonable, the restaurant is spacious and clean, and the atmosphere was nice.

i felt that the waitresses rushed the food. although the food was brought out quickly, they gave us the main while we were still eating the appetizer. the sushi itself was good. they don't use a ton of rice just to fill up the plate.

the menu is also huge, although can be confusing sometimes. there is no shortage of options. overall, i would eat here again."}
{"text":"Stopped by here a couple of Fridays ago with my friends for dinner.  The food wasn't bad - the seaweed salad and grilled calamari were better than the average sushi place.  The Spicy Salmon Dragon Roll was pretty much run-of-the-mill.  One of my friends ordered the St. Patrick box combo and she really enjoyed it.  My other two friends ordered the Black Dragon and the Rainbow rolls and they thought it wasn't too bad - definitely above average.  The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and the food arrived fresh and in a timely manner.  It seemed pretty clean in there as well.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again but, if I was in the neighbourhood and felt like having sushi, why not."}
{"text":"Decent. Sushi is ridiculously large here and prices are really cheap for dinner prices.

I actually like their takoyaki and vegetable tempera was alright."}
{"text":"I was very excited to find an Izakaya place around the corner from my hotel.  My flight arrived late and I was so excited to eat some fried goodness, fill up on some sushi, imbibe some sake, and hit the sack.

The menu at this place is almost as big as the bible.  It's huge!  And, there are multiple menus, which gets very confusing.  I ordered the octopus salad, spicy tuna rolls, and something else that doesn't stick out in my mind.  The octopus salad was good, it seemed to be fresh and was tasty.  

Then, came the grossness.  I bit into my spicy tuna and found a hair.  I called over the waitress and brought it to her attention, and this is where it got weird.  She held the sushi roll with the hair up close to her eye and then looked at it from a variety of angles and lighting.  She then pronounced that it was my  hair.  I laughed, as the hair was short and straight and I have long, curly hair.  My friend and I both told her this was impossible and she almost refused to take it away.  Finally, with some eye rolling and huffing of her breath, she stomped away with the roll.  

Never again."}
{"text":"1. Menu photos are deceptive. The food that comes out is nothing remotely similar in appearance or perceived quality.

2. Simply a Chinese-run, mass-production sushi restaurant packaged for Bay street with oversized plates and pseudo-vogue renovations.

3. Waiters and waitresses do not understand the idea of helping you remove or reorder plates before laying new orders down on your table.

4. Don't blame them for rudeness during your stay or after you pay, however. After all, \"please\" and \"thank you\" are technically foreign words."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner - all you can eat. We ordered a bunch of sushi, sashimi, rolls, kitchen stuff. They brought some of it at a leisurely pace, but some food never came out. Only when we asked they informed us that they were out of tuna. 
Ordering was done through an iPad, and we also had to request it back each time as it seems as though they only had a couple iPads for the entire restaurant. After the first food order mishap they brought our food out slightly more quickly, and made sure to not miss anything on our order - I'll commend them on this. 
The food was subpar; it didn't taste very fresh and they loaded the sushi with rice. They didn't serve us tea, and told us the kitchen was closing a couple minutes before we had to make our final order. 
I'm ranting now but overall it was a bad experience. The servers didn't seem to care, even giving us strange looks when we requested things such as extra sauce. 
After about half an hour my stomach was feeling queasy, and my boyfriend's stomach didn't feel so great either. 
I would definitely not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"If you want cheap hard and water tasting like rice go for it! add sharp weird tasting spices to the mix, $24 CAD or about $20 USD for unlimited sushi, they have one ipad for the whole place to make orders from. The good thing about this place is it's clean, and the waitresses are fast and the food comes out quick."}
{"text":"I always order lunch take out quite a bit from Sushi Queen on Bay. Their sushi isn't super amazing, pretty standard but it's the cheapest around the area where I work. They have very good lunch specials that come with salad and miso soup. I usually get the Spicy Salmon Roll, California Roll & Dynamite Roll lunch special $12 or I'll do a teriyaki lunch which is very affordable at $7-$8. some days I'll order hand rolls which are about $2.95 -$4. They are pretty fast and efficient which is why my colleagues and I order take out but I wouldn't say the taste is anything above average."}
{"text":"Affordable and tasty sushi while in Toronto.

Had lunch there, and came back with some coworkers for dinner a few days later.  Several ordered sushi boats--one was called sushi unversity, and my coworker somehow managed to put all of it away! 

However, just be aware that the iced teas are canned, something I'm not used to...

My other coworkers who had hot items like tempura were very happy with their meals too.

So, would definitely dine there again if in Toronto again."}
{"text":"I was here for dinner with my parents and my daughter (baby).  Service started out nice.  But it didn't finish very nicely.  We did AYCE, and we order two e through their iPad system.  They gave us the iPad for the second order after my father asked if we still had additional dishes coming.  (There's definitely a language barrier with the waiters).   After the second order, we were missing a bunch of items we ordered and even got a dish we didn't order.  It took a while to get the bill after I asked for it.  Then I saw I got charged 15% s.c.  I know restaurants charge gratuity fee for large groups, but this was ridiculous.  

Food quality ranged from average to poor.  Beef and chicken dishes were dry.  

I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I'm always here for AYCE sushi and I tried their fresh oysters once. 

I always ordered a bunch of sashimi and have never been disappointed. Their sashimi is always fresh. I love their mussels that were covered with spicy mayo. They are amazing! But the oysters on AYCE menu is a disappointment. I could only taste the mushroom and the sauce. Where were my oysters???

However, their fresh oysters $6/6 are pretty good. Oh, I forget to mention that their sashimi cocktail is the bomb! I always order 2 or 3 every time. 

You may have to pay extra for soft drinks or tea but they're both free refill (and you only have to pay $1 extra for tea, not bad)

The menu is simple. They divide into different categories so you won't get lost. After choosing what you want, you can pass the iPad back to the waitress and she will take care of your order. The service was fast. I didn't have to wait long for my order to come. 

The atmosphere is friendly yet quiet. It's a nice place for couples since those window seats look very romantic. But it's also a nice place for a group of friends. It got busy for a certain time when I was there with my friends, but I've never been in a rush to finish my food quickly. My friends and I once sat and talked for another 30 minutes after paying the bill. 

AYCE sushi at Queen Izakaya is nothing special compare to other places. However, the price is very good and reasonable for such a good quality of sashimi. Plus, it's downtown! 

I just don't like the geisha doll inside, close to the entrance. Woo, it freaks me out all the time! And the waitress need to be friendlier. 4 times I've been here and I haven't seen a smile on their faces. Were we that annoying to you?"}
{"text":"I dined here yesterday evening after a friend recommended the restaurant to me. Service was quick and clean, however, shortly after finishing my meal and walking home, I could feel my stomach disagreeing with me. I had ordered the spicy lover combo, including the chef's special, caterpillar roll. The latter was tasty, can't say the same for the other rolls I received. They looked awful and only one set really tasted slightly different from the rest. I was expecting something else and something better. The presentation itself was also lacking. Oh well. Now that I know what this place has to offer, I'll be sticking to my regular sushi joints elsewhere."}
{"text":"There really isn't a ton to say about this place except that I wasn't underwhelmed or overwhelmed. Everything was just... there. There's nothing really special about this particular sushi joint to make it stand out. Prices are average and while the serving sizes are good, the lunch combos are fairly limiting unless you choose to go for one of the larger combos that gives you more food. Nothing was bad but nothing was stand out amazing about my meal.

The service is prompt and cold, not very friendly or very warm servers here. It's unfortunate that nothing really stood out at this place, otherwise I'd write a longer review. I'll probably come back but at the request of someone else. I think I'd look for another sushi joint in the area to try before choosing this one again."}
{"text":"Went to this place as friend had a coupon. Tried it out and really liked the fish. Tasted very fresh. I liked the rice too but my friend did not. Personal preference on that I guess. Tempura was very good as well. 

Price was very acceptable but not AYCE so if you are hungry, there are other places but if you want good quality without stuffing your face, this is a good choice for the area."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with decent bento meals. Ambience is pretty which is suitable for a rather quiet dinner. 

 It's not the best sushi but for the price point - majority of items are less than $ 20, I think this restaurant is impressive. Sashimi is a bit pricey.

I had beef teriyaki bento - about three pieces of sashimi, fresh vegetable and friend tempura, decent-siz rice and dumplings. It also comes with miso soup (very nice) and mediocre-tasting salad. I'm not very impressed with how the beef was done but then, this is a sushi place. The sashimi was adequate. 

Eating out for me is a whole experience.... it's not all about food. I know, I know but I've eaten to tons of restaurants and most of them have the same food quality. So ambience matters and a good gauge of a mediocre to a good restaurant. 

Will I come back? Yes! Do I recommend it? Yes!"}
{"text":"Have enjoyed different items on the menu multiple times but finally writing a review. Sushi queen located opposite Sick Kids hospital is at a very popular corner. It serves Lunch & dinner combo items which are all very filling. It is one of pur office party favorite places for take outs. They generally dont deliver as they are pretty busy so we end up picking our order. I went there with my wife for dinner on a weekend and was fairly quiet. Ordered Tempura dinner($7.50) &  Vegetable queen combo($9.75) which was highly filling. It included Miso soup, Salad, Sushi, Tempura - Sweet potato & tofu leaving us very happy."}
{"text":"My family walked down to downtown Toronto,  stop by this restaurant.  We were thinking the food would be good but turn out so bad,  first of all the soya sauce for sushi too salty,  the rice of the rolls too dry.   I ordered two bowls of udon for my son, they gave us two gigantic bowls that expect the little boy to finish them,  the serve didn't even tell us the bowl size that 4 people could eat it.   I eat at many sushi places,  they always give small bowl for soup.   The sashimi way to small just like left over fish.  Bottom line I am not recommend this restaurant for anyone.   I am a cooker and eater I know how the food taste.   Please make your choice wisely when come to food."}
{"text":"Here's the problem with Sushi Queen Izakaya. Their menu is a disaster. With so many poorly categorized options, you have no idea what to order. The menu doesn't guide you at all. When you sit down you are given a menu that resembles any other Japanese spot; lists of bento boxes, sashimi combos, sushi combos, rolls, etc. Fine. Then things get complicated. A two-sided insert outlines their izakaya offerings, which is what we were really interested in. They make it difficult to know what is what as some items are labelled \"Chef Specials\" and others \"izakaya.\" Then, a table top sign provides even more options unhelpfully labelled \"daily specials\" on one side and \"chef's recommendations\" on the other. Pricing for dishes jumps from $4 to $12, but you don't really understand portions. It's a clusterfuck. 

I'd like to see all the small plate options in one place, and divided sensibly. Maybe my price, by portion size, type of fish, something, anything at all. And why not number the selections so it's easier to order? After being seated our server left us alone for 15 minutes, probably because she understands how bewildering the menu is.

FINALLY we settled on an order. Two of us shared crispy eel rolls (6 pieces), salmon and tuna rolls topped with lobster salad (5 pieces), takoyaki balls (6 pieces) and seafood yaki soba noodles. I can decidedly say that nothing was great. The takoyaki was overcooked and doughy, the salmon and tuna rolls were falling apart and overloaded with the too-salty lobster, and the eel rolls weren't even that crispy. Even the green tea was a disappointment. The noodles were the meal's only saving grace, and I just mean the noodles. I ate around the overcooked seafood. I could forgive a disorganized menu if the food was great, and this just wasn't.

It seems that the \"Izakaya\" in their name is a misnomer. If I return to this place, I'll stick with one of their bento boxes.

Obligatory Title Pun: A ROYAL letdown.

Menu Readability: My entire review was menu readability, son.

Need to mention: As others have mentioned the service is slow. How slow? At one point we looked over and a dude had fallen asleep waiting for his order. Not a lie.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'll take quality over quantity any day."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, awful service. Don't come here looking for real Japanese food. The sushi pizza is one of the more interesting dishes here. The servers here are really forgetful and rude AF."}
