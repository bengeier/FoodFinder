{"text":"Absolutely terrible!! Buyer beware. We had a reserved room held for us for my granddaughters 6 year birthday party and this place was not only completely empty but totally unprepared for us even though they were called and reminded 2 days prior and even the same day. We only had 20 people. When we arrived there was not 1 person in the place, bar or restaurant. Only 2 people were visible working. Our server was very nice but completely over whelmed. There was NO manager present anywhere in the place. It took over 45 minutes for us to get our drinks and that was only the start of it. I am too exhausted to go on but I will tell you this......WE WILL NEVER GO BACK which is a shame as this place used to be a great place to go. Believe everything you hear about this place. It needs to be closed or completely taken over and managed. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!"}

{"text":"Despite all the signage for weekday specials in front of the place, I do not know if it is even possible to get food there. A group of four of us were seated immediately and that was the end of the dining experience.  Waitress after waitress, careful not to get to close,  walked by on the other room and completely ignored us. Not even so much as a glass of water or a dirty look. Then it became a game to see just how long it would them. Well, after 45 minutes all humor was gone. We left and and advise anyone, don't waste your time. Life is too short. It is an interesting place to look at and leave it at that. All their external efforts to get you to walk through the doors and they still don't get it, I was already there and you treated us like dirt! NO THANKS!"}
{"text":"Well ordered the prime rib..... Not impressed in the least.  Was cold as was most of the meal.  Waitresses were great but greeter was completely rude we debated on leaving because of it. My husband had lobster that was under cooked and steak that was also under cooked.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"There it was, simply amazing  ,from the Sea food , their mouth watering steaks , and wings. Their Entertainment starts on Wednesdays with a just amazing acoustic band named \"Three Sides\", in the lower bar.  Saturday's there is always a band guaranteed to impress, in the fishbowl, upstairs in the upper bar , while serving some of the most amazing sushi. A great place with just as good prices , and service."}

{"text":"One unhappy Marylander. Ordered crab cakes, and ended up having to get a fatty not tasty steak (the worst steak I've ever had in my life) because my crab cakes \"fell apart\" when they were being plated. Now in all fairness they were obviously severely understaffed and the owner took my meals off the bill which was nice. They need to figure out if they are a Maryland style restaurant or a fusion restaurant. I will go back and give them another chance because there are such things as having a \"bad night\""}
{"text":"Kazoku Japanese restaurant in the Baltimore House is great.  Collin is a very talented and entertaining chef and the food is delicious.  Did not have to wait long but I would recommend calling to make a reservation since they only have 2 chef for now."}
{"text":"Decent food, terrible service. I mean, absolutely awful. A mix of inexperienced wait staff along with more experienced wait staff who don't listen or don't care. 

Trying to get a drink refill is a chore. (They don't seem to understand that their tips go up as your check goes up.) Trying to find someone to pay your check takes forever. Forget about dessert. Also forget about getting your salad or appetizer before your meal arrives.

You wouldn't put up with this at Eat 'n Park. We tried to give them a second (and third) chance, because we do like the food, and we like to support local businesses, but we're done."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time, hit up Lone Star or Applebee's down the street. The service took 15 minutes before taking the drink order- \"I couldn't find your table\". The dry, stringy ribs were too tough to cut with a steak knife. Worse yet, the prime rib turned out to be a fatty piece of substandard beef (I think it may have been beef). The only saving grace were run-of-the-mill crab cakes. I had to beg for a refill."}
{"text":"It used to be really good as a matter of fact I had my wedding rehearsal dinner there 24 years ago. It has consistantely gone down hill. It used to be great to have a quality seafood restaurant in your backyard without it being a franchise. The last time I was there I had the soft shelled crabs and they were absolutely terrible.

We used to also go there every year for a holiday dinner when we had our family come in from out of town. Never again unless they change their ways and go back to quality."}
{"text":"This was always a favorite place of ours to eat. But tonight was very disappointing to say the least. From the wait to have a waitress take our drink order to after ordering food she comes back to say they ran out of something which does happen but it just kept getting worse n worse. After we put in food order our waitress comes back n says how do u want your chicken cooked? We all looked n was confused ourselves. Lol then she's realizes it was a stupid question for chicken. After being in there for an hour and 5 min and still no food and annoyed at this point from seeing other tables that came in have their food already we asked for our check. I'm not sure what happened to this place but we were all very disappointed. One star is being nice for tonight's experience."}
{"text":"I really hope the owner reads these reviews.  Because my husband and I used to enjoy the Baltimore House--but after our last meal there, we won't be back for a while.

The Baltimore House is one of the few places left in the Greater Pittsburgh area that serves stuffed flounder, which my husband loves.  The first three times he had it, he said it was perfect.  Heck, kitschy d√©cor and oddball waitresses aside, for years we had great food every time, until our last visit.  The appetizer was burned.  Okay, so we'll say something, but our dinners are always great.  We would have said something, if given the chance!  There weren't that many people in the restaurant, but one would have thought they were packed to the gills; we didn't see our waitress for another 20 minutes, when she brought our entrees, then rushed off to the kitchen again.  Then we started eating our dinners, which both tasted like they had been liberally doused with salt.  Practically inedible.  Then a family of about 15 people came in, and the waitress busied herself with them during the rest of our visit.  We had trouble just getting the bill, let alone having a chance to complain.  We decided to pay it, leave, and stay away from Baltimore House for a bit.

We may go back in a few months to see if things have changed, because the food used to be really great.  But I really hope someone who matters sees these reviews, because it's sad that they're probably losing a couple of long-time customers."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place is still in business. The building and decor is odd. Was there in the winter and was sitting by an outside wall and had to wear my coat because the cold air from outside was coming in.  The servers are horrible and the food isn't much better."}
{"text":"We've been here many times before. I used to consider it my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. We haven't been there for over a year and, well, this place has nose-dived since then.

Before I talk about anything else about our experience, I want to say that we didn't see one smile there all night. Not a single one.

We went in at 8PM on a Saturday night. From the moment we went in, we had to wait. We waited probably 7 minutes before we even saw the Hostess. As soon as she saw us, she told us we'd have to wait at least 15 minutes. We sat down at the bar. And waited. Finally the sushi chef offered to get us some beers. We had to wait for those, too. Once we got the beers, mine was all funky. It had gotten warm and had been put back in the cooler. Gross.

We ended up waiting about 20 minutes to be seated. They sat us down underneath the stage while a band was warming up. After some waiting, the server brought us some cold bread and we asked if we could go sit in the corner away from the band. She obliged.

We waited. Finally we got our drinks. After we finished them, we had to actually go to the bar and ask for refills because the server was just nowhere to be found. Maybe she was busy in the back trying to do her sidework or something...I don't know. She only had four tables, I don't know why she was missing half the night.

The food was good. Their prices have gone up since we had been there. They have this three item combo where you pick like a steak, some seafood, some chicken, etc...and you get mashed potatoes and veggies. It used to be $19, now its $24. We got the lobster tail, the prime rib and coconut shrimp. It was all good. We also got this seafood platter that had shrimp scampi, beer batter cod, scallops and a baked potato for like $17. Everything was good. But the fact that we just had to wait and wait and wait made it all kind of crappy.

I guess they recently added some teppenyaki (or Hibachi as you yinzers like to call is) tables and stuff. They have sushi also but the sushi chef was making the sushi in the bar area. We sat and watched him make about six rolls and he didn't wash his hands once. 

The only real consolation was that she only charged us for one vodka soda and I had about five. Plus the two beers and ice tea.

Oh...and the band was awful. They were called Run 4 Cover and....you bet we did as soon as we could get out of there."}
{"text":"Service wasn't really good. Food was cold, prices were normal but it would of bin better if the food was hot. The crab legs had a good taste but where cold. The prime rib was really fatty and no flavor. Very disappointed since I really wanted to good and try this place"}
{"text":"Long story short: We were there waiting for almost 3 hours for our food. There were maybe 6 other patrons in the establishment. Sushi chef was a no-show and they were out of items we wanted to order (it took them 2 hours to realize they had no gyoza!) What kills me here is that the place was NOT busy at all. Not once did the waiter offer to refill our water. I wish they'd had just said they couldn't serve us.

In detail: (I'd been here before for sushi and the only issue before was waiting to be seated...which took 10-15 minutes) We (a party of 4) arrived at 4:30 for the 1/2 off sushi and we waited a while to be seated. We were only seated when we walked into the bar portion and told someone we were there. The waiter alerted us that the sushi chef was late and that there might be a little bit of a wait and that they'd extend the 1/2 off sushi discount for us as a result. We figured maybe they were stuck in traffic or something, it happens, but they'd eventually show up soon. We sat around for a while waiting to order some drinks and appetizers. The frozen drinks couldn't be done because their machine wasn't working. They had no edamame at all. We ordered tuna tar-tar, spicy shrimp, gyoza, miso soup, 8 sushi rolls and our drinks. I believe it was about 5-5:15pm (30 to 45 hour later) before the miso soup came out. The tuna tar-tar and spicy shrimp appetizer came out about 15 minutes later. We asked about the gyoza and the waiter said that there had been an issue since the gyoza wasn't on the menu properly (or something similar...which made no sense to us) and that he'd get the order put in again. I understand that since the sushi chef hadn't shown up yet, that some things couldn't be made yet ...but we finally started receiving the sushi rolls at around 6:15pm (almost 2 hours from the time we arrived/ordered). We got the sushi rolls NOT because the sushi chef arrived, but because 2 guys were making it themselves (we didn't realize this until we were paying our bills, the sushi chef was a no-show all night). The guys did a decent job at making the sushi, so I'm sure they had some training. They brought everyone's order out plopped on plates at random and the waiter didn't know which roll was which and he had to ask the guys who made the sushi about what was what...and they didn't seem to even quite know. The sushi rolls were good, but not quite what was described on the menu. Some had a type of fish or vegetable substituted for something else or just mixed around. We're frustrated and at this point not going to argue about what the sushi is supposed to be. We want to eat and leave. At 6:30 we finally had our last sushi roll delivered to the table. We asked about the gyoza again and the waiter came back and said they had none. 2 hours...and they finally figured out that they had NONE. This was kind of the last straw with the place. Due to the wait and everything, the waiter said the manager was willing to give us all each 1 drink free. Most of us didn't order another and opted to have our current one free. When we got our checks, the drinks hadn't been removed and the waiter had to go back and adjust the check which took a while. We finally got out of there around 7:15. Not all of this was the sushi chef's fault for not showing, not all was the waiter's fault...Everything just had something wrong or missing from the service, to the food, to the missing food. We won't be going back. I've never had to wait almost 3 hours or had as many issues as we did. Big shame because we live so close to Kazoku."}
{"text":"Yinz need to calm..... Baltimore house has great food and a great atmosphere. I enjoy looking at all of the different decorations when I go. I had the lobster tails and they were great.... I honestly love this place. I have lots of memories here... And all of the negative reviewers on here need to chill. If you don't like this place then don't come. They have plenty of other business"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in the neighborhood to see a movie, and we wanted to find a place that could accommodate both salmon for me and steak for her. When we saw the Baltimore House while driving, it looked like the perfect spot, so we excitedly parked and went in. When you walk in you are greeted with a mostly empty fish cooler, one can only assume that at the height of this establishment's popularity the cooler was filled with fresh fish, but now sat sadly barren. I say it was mostly empty because it still held a few pieces of fake greenery with plastic fish on top, as a decoration that I appreciated. The lighting was a combination of bright neon and nothing else, which created an ambiance very similar to a strip club, making the massive but unfortunately mostly empty dining room feel like an undiscovered cavern adorned with various seafaring-related decorations. We were led through the cavern to a separate dining room that was a striking departure from the first. It was reminiscent of your grandparents house, but again, filled with sea-related decorations. I was hoping to get a simple salmon filet, so you would think I wouldn't have a problem with that at a seafood restaurant, but turns out there is no salmon at all at this seafood restaurant. Before we realized this, we ordered two iced teas that we didn't even take the straw wrappers off of, but we were still charged for the drinks when we told the waitress that we were leaving, $5 for two unsweetened iced teas. This place may have been the bees knees 15 years ago, but these days it's a hollow shell of what I assume it used to be.

EDIT: Bumped up to two stars from one because they have a kick-ass Bruce Lee statue outside"}
{"text":"It was a good meal. My boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. He got something with sea food and I got scallops shrimp and lobster. The chef was good to talk to and friendly.  We were the only ones there but it was OK because the food was great were actually going back tonight. I'll be sure to take pictures this time"}
{"text":"Not the most authentic Japanese experience we've ever had, but the food was reasonably priced and surprisingly good!   The soup tasted more like French onion than the miso soup typically found in hibachi restaurants.  Our spicy tuna roll was more like a tuna roll with spicy sauce, rather than the chopped tuna/chili blend I'm accustomed to.  And our hibachi chef, Dave, while very friendly and skillful, was more TeppanYINZer than Teppanyaki.  Still, we had a good time, and enjoyed the food.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Pathetic! A. Took 15 minutes to get a waitress
B. Took 25 minutes to get a drink
C. Took 45+minutes to get our appetizer
D. Upcharge on a caesar salad which was all lettuce, which was served after we all finished our house salad or soup.
E. Took 75 minutes to get our meal which was luke warm.
F. The calamari app was undercooked and for 6.99 there wasn't much on the plate.
G. The scallop dinner had no flavor.
H. The shrimp dinner was blah but they were huge shrimp.
I. They had no baked potatoes
J. The garlic mashed potatoes were more like starchy potatoes with no flavor.
K. We asked for more bread to which we were told it was in the oven. We then were served sliced bread that was never in a oven. I think they ran to Sheetz and bought a loaf.
L. The snow outside looked so appetizing because the refills were so slow.
M. We weren't the only people complaining.
N. Even with Groupon it was a total waste of money.
O. Eat elsewhere
P. My dogs poopsicles would of probably been a better meal."}
{"text":"Not pleased at all with our experience. My husband couldn't even eat his shrimp pasta. My steak was a pile of fat. Our sampler appetizer was half fried to a black crisp. The poor wait staff was severely over worked with the amount of customers in the building, although they were pleasant & doing a good job with our table of nine people. The food horrible. Was embarrassed to have recommended my entire family to eat here. And to have paid the amount we did for the food we got was really upsetting. Will NEVER return!"}
{"text":"We used to love going to this restaurant for AYCE crab legs on Sunday. So for a special occasion we took our family there, I called ahead to make sure they still did the AYCE on Sunday and asked if we needed reservations which I figured we didn't but wanted to make sure. She said they had AYCE and no reservations needed it was available 5-9 as usual. We got there around 6:30 and they were completely out of crab legs. We drove over 20 minutes for a complete disappointment. But we still went in and ordered off of the menu. It was not as good as it had been in the past the food was cold and bland. I got scallops and they were so fishy that I couldn't eat them. I eat a lot of seafood and understand the difference between a normal seafood taste and old fishy food and it was the latter. One of the only times ever that I have been starving and literally couldn't choke my food down. But I had my fries left at least, So when I asked for ketchup they brought out a squeeze bottle and took one bite and realized it was cocktail sauce that I had put on mine and my daughters food. Completely ruined her meal and when I said something they didn't believe that it was cocktail sauce!  The whole staff didn't care from the point we walked in until we left. Very disappointing since we used to love it here. I'm not sure if we will ever go back."}
{"text":"I dont know about all the bad reviews..?? I live in the area,and have eaten here more than several times,and the food,service,and decor are some of the best around. Mom and i came here for lunch today on a Groupon,and the lobster bisque was delicious,and my stuffed banana peppers were out of this world. Mom got a large, thick,juicy pork chop ,grilled perfectly,and 2 sides for only $8.99.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  No complaints from us!"}
{"text":"You've got to admit, this place has charm.  They take the pirate schtick VERY seriously and there is lots of kooky eye candy to distract you.  And while eating at this place is an experience in itself, the food is just eh.  It's you're typical bland seafood fare.  They have pretty decent wedding soup, I'll give them that.  But it's just very boring baked seafood in butter, with no seasoning.  The menu is enormous though and I've hardly begun to sample it, so maybe you'll have better luck.  It certainly wasn't bad, it was just kinda so-so.  The problem was, the bill just mounted up very quickly and I spent more than I would have expected, especially given the quality of the food.  Will I return?  I don't know.  It's a fun place to take visitors to the area because it's such an interesting spot, but I'm still kind of on the fence with the food."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I tried this place for the first time, being drawn in by the promises of 1lb of crab legs for $10.  3 of us ordered our crab while the other 2 ordered steak.  

Long story short: the crab legs were amazing, I felt bad for the two that ordered steak.  

Looking at the steak, it had a not-so-right gray color to it, first red flag, then you notice that half of it is mostly fat.  For $20, I would want the large steak that it is supposed to be...not have to cut away half of the inedible portion of it.  I didn't want to taste test it for myself, so I'll take my friends' word for it that it tasted as terrible as it looked.  One of the unlucky receivers of steak called over a manager.  Her excuse was that \"the cut of meat is supposed to be fatty\" to which my friend replied, \"I could get a better cut of meat at a chain restaurant\" (zingggg).  The manager comped him the price of the steak so all was well.

Our waitress and the whole ambiance of the place was...a little weird. The place was completely empty for being dinner time on a Saturday night before Christmas.  Previous posters have explained the weirdness of the place and the waitresses so I don't have to go any further.

Based on that, and the quality of my crab legs I have to give this place 4 out of 5 - I would definitely return..but ONLY for crab legs, I'm not sure that I would trust anything else on the menu.  But if you were to ask those in my group who got the steak, they'd give it a 0 if they could."}
{"text":"Horrible. We ate here because the water was off at our house. Forgoing the meal would have been better."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on a Friday night. The place was empty. After we got our food. I now know why. Our zucchini appetizer was loaded with grease and over cooked. It was rock hard. My husband ordered prime rib. It was rare and full of fat and gristle. I ordered lobster. They handed me a hammer after I asked for something to crack the shell. A seafood restaurant and nothing to crack open shells. A fellow coworker told me not to eat here. I wish I would have listened. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Horrible! Entire place smells like a urinal cake. Food some of the worst I've ever had. Stay away."}
{"text":"Came here last Tuesday with a friend for dinner. The food and the service were both horrible! Outside there is a huge sign saying 2$ drinks all day, the waiter told us they had no 2$ drinks and seemed to have no clue what we were talking about. I ordered the Alfredo and my friend ordered shrimp. Our salad and soup came out and it was almost an hour before our meal came. When we did finally get our meals, they were wrong. The alfredo was completely tasteless. We never did get our coleslaw and we were charged for rice that we didn't order. Another thing I didn't like was that we were brought our check before we even got our food. The place was far from busy.  We ended up paying 50$ for food we didn't eat! Were ended up leaving and going to McDonalds!"}
{"text":"The food was good but could have been hotter.  When the butter does not melt on the baked potato that says it all.  Had the broiled seafood, which was excellent. The lobster was perfectly cooked and the shrimp and scallops were tasty.  The others in the group ordered prime rib (which they both said was very good), crab legs (a lot of crab legs) and another seafood platter (very good).  The service was a bit slow (we refilled our own water glasses).  The place is huge and very complicated to navigate. I have passed this place 1000's of times but this was the first time I tried it.  I may or may not go back.

Having a Groupon really paid off!"}

{"text":"This was my second time at the Baltimore House. My first experience here was awesome. Good service and excellent food! My second experience however was completely underwhelming.  I'd give this a one star rating if my waiter was not doing the best he could, but he was pretty awesome considering the circumstances. It started with another server bringing dirty side plates while not even realizing they were dirty until after setting them down on the table. I received my mixed drink with flat ginger ale. It was replaced for a fresh drink, but I was charged for 2 drinks. We ordered a calamari appetizer which was a very small portion  and had basically no flavor. The menu is different as they no longer serve sushi or habachi.  I ordered the surf and turf and got the teriyaki chicken with a crab cake. The crab cake was HORRIBlE while the chicken was okay. They forgot half of my food, which the server was apologetic and offered to get out to me, but at that point I was just ready to go! Stopped and got some tacos from a little place down the street right after."}
{"text":"I love the AYCE crab legs here.  The service is hit-and-miss, but the crab legs are spectacular.  So much so that we drive all the way to Curry Hollow from Cranberry during rush hour and are willing to deal with server roulette.  I remember Baltimore house growing up, and it is definitely a shadow of its former self.  Between the terrible exterior decor, and the hybrid decision to have an american seafood joint and a hibachi joint and the lack of good (non smoking) talent, I would advise my family and friends to not eat anything on the menu that's not the crab legs simply because I can guarantee that the kitchen isn't turning it around fast enough to provide fresh ingredients, and they're not making enough money to waste on keeping fresh stock of anything not on the AYCE special.  It's also kind of dirty looking. 
...But the crab legs are simply to DIE for.  They freakin' nailed it."}
{"text":"I just visited for the \"All-you-can-eat\" Snow Crab Legs. This was a completely different and utterly disappointing experience.

My boyfriend and I arrived around 4:50pm to await friends. We told the server that we wouldn't need menus, because we were getting the Crab Legs. Around 5:56pm, no crab legs!!! We asked for a manager to find out our food situation. 

At this point, we were contemplating leaving as we were not paying $23ish for one plate of legs per \"over an hours time\". We received our food around 6:05pm. My friend's steak was about 40% fat and I was told the kitchen ran out of vegetables! I was unable to eat any other sides as I am on a low-carb diet. They did not offer me any other options. 

We were so disappointed we ended up leaving. Maybe we'll try again another Sunday..."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been here before years ago - was decent then - but not so much now - we went on a Saturday night expecting it to be busy but it wasn't, and I should have read some reviews before going!  Shame on me.    It took over 10 minutes to get greeted and drinks ordered which took another 10 to arrive.   Our salad came 15 minutes after she brought the drinks and bread - the entrees took over an hour, and she forgot my Lobster Bisque (which she brought only after I asked about it - had one piece of lobster in it but mostly broth and potatoes).     My husband got the wrong salad and ranch dressing when he asked twice for Italian dressing.   The fish was ok, but not as described in the menu.  She gave my sides to him and his to me - thank God we're married and can share plates.
   She gave him mashed potatoes when he ordered a baked potato.   Then when we pointed that out, she said \"oh let me go get you one\" but then came back over 10 minutes later saying that the cook told her they were out of baked potatoes and he substituted the mashed (no one asked us!)   She asked if he wanted something different and he said 'No thanks i'll eat these\" but when I asked him why he didn't get a vegetable or fries he just looked at me and said \"Why so she can bring me squid as a substitute?\"    The mashed sweet potatoes taste like Gerber baby food potatoes (not kidding - I'd avoid these altogether).
  Our waitress had a very stoic  \"I could care less\" attitude while waiting on us and everything took way too long to arrive.   No manager checked on us and the waitress never checked on us to see if our food was ok.  The bathroom door does not close nor lock and the staff were seen complaining (using the F-bomb) right by customers at the bar - about their hours and wanting to go home and about not liking the long shift they were working.     You can tell the place is not managed properly (I used to work in food service years ago so I know) and the staff really don't like being there.     
I would not return, not even with a coupon.      My husband could not wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"Food was overcooked and the service was slow. 15 minutes for a draft beer? 

Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Driving past this place for many years, my family was always scared away by the tacky exterior complete with busty pirate wench. When we finally decided to stop in, we were quite surprised to find what is a very vast and extravagant interior. Sure, there's still some tacky inside, but you could spend hours just walking through exploring the curious objects like it was some strange museum. 

The prices for both the fish and the alcohol are extremely reasonable; much lower than you'll find for comparable meals in the area. The fish also met with my father's very exacting standards (he is never one to miss when someone uses \"K\"rab meat, \"nearly fresh\" fish, or just the wrong type of fish altogether). 

The interior space, prices, and location near Jefferson Memorial Park also made this the perfect place when we needed a restaurant for a post-funeral lunch. Their menu options were very traditional and perfect for our needs, and as a group I believe we finished every last item served on the buffet. With the reasonable drink prices, it was also very easy to make it a cash bar without anyone feeling put out. 

At this point we've eaten there maybe a half dozen times - any time my family comes to town we usually take a trip over. The individual experiences have been a bit of a mixed bag, with the worst being a Friday night we went and were seated upstairs near a band that was warming up the entire meal. I and my mother enjoyed the crab cakes, not the ambiance, though my father was very disappointed with his seafood pasta meal as being almost devoid of fish and overly sauced. The waitresses have also been kindof mixed, some being very nice while others have been downright weird.

Our best meals there have generally been during the week, or for lunch, where they seat us downstairs off the bar area. I will probably avoid dinner hour on the weekends going forward, since it's those times that didn't go as well.

Despite a couple of mediocre experiences, I still like this place and have never personally had a bad meal food-wise. It's one of the few non-chain restaurants in the Century III area, and honestly the interior just fascinates me every time."}
{"text":"I keep going to this restaurant bc its kind of tacky and fun looking on the outside and the one dining room looks like a cozy old mans den which for some reason I like.

Last night we went and it was... strange. 

This restaurant is huge.  There is a hibachi room and a sushi restaurant.  Given the quality of the food for hte love of god i implore you not to order their sushi.  It cant be anything but food poisoning on a plate!

We were seated in the \"old mans den room.\"  Our waitress walked by our table 3 times and then came over and said, \"Opps...I forgot to see you.\"  I asked what beers they had on tap and said said, \"no beer tonight.  tap system down.  no beer.\"  so i asked if they had bottles.  She said she was sure they had bottles but did not know what kind.  In fact, she basically denied beer existed, until another waitress came over and confirmed they had Sam Adams in bottles.  I order one.  \"We're out of that one.  I can just bring you what we have.\"  WTF? 

Turns out, they had Labatts.

We ordered the crab leg appetizer, and when they brought us our bucket for the shells, there were bits of crab meat and smelly water in the bottom of the bucket.  Its obvious they dont wash those so if for some reason you maybe threw something you were going ot eat into your bucket...leave it.  that was pretty gross.

The crab legs were good.

They have this surf & turf thing where you can get different items and it was only $13.  Never order $13 surf & turf.  This is a life lesson.

I had more crab legs and steak.  The steak tasted freezer burned and was inedible.  

My friend had shrimp and baby back ribs and liked them, but this guy will eat anything so i do not trust his judgement.

Half way through our meal the waitress came over, removed my half drunk Labatts and brandished a bottle of Sam Adams.  \"Ohh...I was wrongsies, we have Sam Adams now!\"  she said that.  

It was so weird.  After she put it on the table she sat down on the floor and said, \"Whew, now I can breathe.\"  I think she's just a kook.  There were only three of us dining there.

It was so weird.

I'll be back, probably over a year from now, just for crab legs.  This place is weird but still seems kind of fun and it might be a fun place for cocktials."}
{"text":"Worst service possible. The restaurant was pretty much empty. Waited an hour to be spoken to by anyone- until bus boy took our drink order. Food was good lobster and steak."}
{"text":"I really don't know where to begin by telling you just how bad my experience was here this evening

 Strike ...1 it took about 10 minutes for my coke to arrive after the initial 10 min wait to actually order it 

strike 2... It took about 10 more minutes after the coke just to get a menu.

strike 3....Another 10 minutes goes by, finally waiter comes by after I flag him down and I decided to order 2 appetizers the Lobster Bisque arrives 15 min after ordering it,... It also arrived at room temp, and I also ordered the buffalo shrimp, it came about 10 or 15 minutes after the soup,it was ok, but you sure don't get many, I think I counted 9 small shrimp both apps were ordered at the same time, talk about slow

strike 4....another 15 minutes until I see my waiter, I decided on the Alfredo added shrimp to the pasta for an up charge 

Strike 5 ...about 30 minutes later I get the entree it's horrible the shrimp tasted like they were frozen and quickly thawed in water then added to the less than satisfactory Alfredo 

Strike 6... I have to ask for my check as waiter was passing...as I about had it with this place, it wasn't even worth my time to complain as it was obvious management didn't care about how the bussiness was run, I mean no one ever visit it my table or the table next to me. That table was less also less than impressed. I'm sure it's their last visit also.

Conclusion don't let the name of this place get you in the door, trust me you will be very disappointed. Save your money and go just about anywhere else in the country before going to the Baltimore House in Pleasant Hills"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for well over 25 years for the crab legs. While they are always great. Tonight was the first time I've ever had horrendous service. The assistant manager on duty never did cone back to the table after she assured me she'd be right back. Dinner took almost 3 hrs for 2 people. Each time I needed a refill on my drink I had to flag someone down. While I understand they were short staffed the restaurant was not that busy to warrant the lack of concern or service. 

The woman assistant manager couldn't be bothered with complaints. Numerous people were complaining and waited 15 minutes to be seated when the restaurant was not full."}
{"text":"Terrible service and horrible management. As soon as I sat down a lady, assuming the manager was yelling at an employee for be late again. The waitress looked high has a kite.Has potential to be amazing place because the food is not bad and atmosphere is nice. Will go back but only to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"It sucked.  Started with maitre'd, he. wanted to know if we had reservations when two thirds of the restaurant was empty.  I thought it was a cheetos thing and should slide him a few.  Steak was basically medium raw when I ordered medium well.  Lobster was still gooey in the center.  The shrimp and the mashed potatoes were good.  $98.00 for two people.....no.  Long island iceteas were good but small."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would. Without a doubt, the worst meal we have had in years. Even the French fries weren't good; how can you mess up those? We should have known better as soon as we saw the decor. At one point, I said to my husband, maybe the guy from Bar Rescue is in the back. I think that's the only thing that could save this place. We actually went to Chilis to get a better meal, at least knowing what we'd get!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Last night my girlfriend, her brother, my one year old, and I went for the blue claw crabs and it was an excellent experience. This is not only the only place around here that has the crabs, but they were also among the best I have ever had. The owner drives to Maryland every Thursday to make this happen. I have lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years now and am a Long Island NY transplant, these crabs are the thing I missed most from home and they really did them right, and at only $2.99 a piece! If you like blue crabs seriously go check this place out, you will not be disappointed! The staff was very friendly, they had a high chair with working straps (not a given in the area), and everything was clean. 

I have also been here for crab leg and prime rib AYCE night and they did a great job with that as well."}
{"text":"Just went there for the first time.  Arrived at 8 on a Saturday for dinner, waited at the \"please wait to be seated\" sign.....they seemed confused why we were there?    Once seated the waitress was attentive.   We did use a living social coupon, which based on on comments here we expected problems, there were none.  The food was ok , we got the fried zucchini then prime rib and filet.  The meats were good, the sides were not very good.  In general the place is odd, trying to be too many things... seafood, buffet, Japanese steakhouse, night club, bar....not horrible but no need to go back."}
{"text":"Actually a 5 for service, hostess and waitress were both very friendly and helpful. Salads left a bit to be desired, but our entrees were delicious even if they were frozen. So maybe a 3 for the food."}
{"text":"We have been there 2x.  Once for drinks in the bar during a football game and sushi in the sushi bar with friends, and another just the sushi bar with our family. The sushi is very good but only priced reasonably if you are there for the 1/2 off deals.  Both times it was freezing cold.  Pipes frozen in two of the bathrooms it was so cold on one occasion. Service was ok and attentive."}
{"text":"Well, its official, I've found my least favorite restaurant in the Pittsburgh area.  

I came here on a Saturday night with my sister-in-law and getting inside was tricky.  There was some sort of benefit concert taking place so it was unclear where to enter.  Once we finally navigated that we were asked to sit in smoking or non-smoking.  We chose non, but let's just say that didn't stop the smoke from bellowing over to our table.  In fact, my hair and clothes reeked from the hour I sat there. 

I can count on one hand the number of times I've sent a meal back to the kitchen and this recent experience at the Baltimore House can be counted in that category.  We both chose the Alaskan crab legs and both immediately returned them.  The little to no crab meat in the case was cold and rubbery.  The waitress was nice though and immediately grabbed them and asked if we wanted something else.  I got the crab cakes, which were 'meh' and my s-i-l just ordered mozzarella sticks that were also inedible.  So we didn't insult or further upset our waitress she wrapped them up and hid them so it looked like she ate them.  

Service was spotty but our waitress was nice.  Another employee at one point walked by our tables and yelled out the F-word.  The 'bouncer' at the door near the ground floor entrance said he was only there for the event and had no idea if/when you could be seated.  

Decor is very bizarre and includes a non-working Jacuzzi under the steps.  There appears to be a nautical/pirate theme but I also saw some other weird statues, such as a dog.  I wouldn't mind all that if the food wasn't so terrible.  Sorry, I'll never return."}
{"text":"Seafood was poor and preparation was also poor.  Most everyone was eating the daily special (crab legs) so maybe would have been better off following the crowd and trying what was popular.  The general consensus of the group was that it was poor to unremarkable."}
{"text":"We arrived here at 5 o'clock, no drinks until 20 minutes after we were seated, did not even get our silverware until 6, and then food at 6:30 when there were only 3 other tables in the entire restaurant. Horrible, slow, under staffed service. They mixed up the tables food, our bread was taken by another tables server, and we did not leave until 7... we spent 2 hours here, I do not recommend to ANYONE."}
{"text":"The Baltimore House advertises All you can eat Pork Chops and 2 sides. We have been going there for a while and had enjoyed the chops with 2 sides....now all of a sudden it's just \"a\" side which is French fries which are horrible...soggy and tasteless. It's a shame to advertise on a big board out front and on the tables the the chops come with 2 sides and only offer you fries.  BAIT AND SWITCH. Needless to say we won't be going back. One good thing though is the waiter,Jack, he is the bomb. Gr8 waiter with a super attitude,unlike his female counter part who gets the order wrong and forgets to bring the salad the day we were there for the ribs. She not only got our order wrong but also another table as well.  This is not a way to build your business on a day that is usually slow. Aka. Wednesday."}
{"text":"This place ranks among the absolute WORST OF THE WORST! Here is a list of a few lowlights of the evening:

1) Bewildering wacky, maze-like, dismal, neglected interior, with a crazy mish-mash of pirate, Asian, and pub-themed decorative items (that all look to have a permanent film of grease).

2) Insane combination of both impossibly dim lighting in some spots and almost painfully glaring chandeliers in others (probably for the best so that we could not really see the unholy awful food that was about to be served to us).

3) Overflowing, plugged-up bathroom sink with no paper towels (at least there was toilet paper in the stall)

4) Waitress at neighboring table (three feet away) TWICE dropped ramekins of melted butter all over table and floor (our waitress, however, was friendly, prompt, and competent at least).

5) Some sort of rock band was setting up in the adjoining bar area and had to troop back and forth through dining area, repeatedly, with all of their equipment and instruments to set up on stage...this went on for about a half hour and was very disruptive.

6) Most importantly, the food was HORRID! My husband's lobster bisque was a salty, gloppy mess which may have had some lobster flavoring added to it somewhere in there, along with the puzzling presence of potatoes. Steamed clams were ok..not great but not terrible...were overcooked though. Prime rib was inedible. Leathery, thin, super-fatty, cold, and other than the taste of old beef tallow, had no flavor...like it had been sitting in a warmer for the last four or five days. I ate a few bites because I was starving and we were still an hour and a half away from home, but it was so vile that I just left three-quarters of it on the plate. Didn't bother sending it back because by then, it was evident that any replacement would have been no better. My husband got an abomination of a broiled seafood medley that was rubbery and tasted of nothing but oily melted margarine and garlic powder. 

Been to many a restaurant in my 50 years, and usually am at least moderately satisfied. This place, however, was among the worst I have ever had the misfortune to experience. It looks like it used to be a good place, maybe like 25 years ago, and perhaps some family member inherited it a while back who know little of decent food and restaurant management, and is now just barely hanging on. Ultimately, my advice: AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here before on a couple of occasions and the food here is hit or miss. 

Stopped in for a quick happy hour beer today and got a Rouge Dead Guy Ale draft. It's a little malt-heavy/sweeter than I prefer but for a buck, I'll drink it and be happy. 

The downstairs bar area caters to smokers but the dining area on the first floor is non-smoking."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I have never been enthusiastic about The Baltimore House. I can recall seeing their commercials on local TV for years and wanting very much to try them, if for no other reason than that they were a seafood restaurant that wasn't Red Lobster. Although, after about 5 mediocre-to-bad visits over the course of as many years prior to my Yelp tenure, I finally gave up on them. The reviews I read on Yelp in the years since my last experience with Baltimore House only affirmed my boycott. 

That was until Kay had a hankering for mussels, again. Why not give BH another chance? 

And BH does them pretty well if our meal was any proof. The mussels were as tender, juicy, and buttery as they should be with some chopped garlic added to pump up the flavor quotient. 

I couldn't decide on what to order for myself, so I went with their Seafood Norfolk, which features everything I pine for when I errr...sea-dine; lobster, scallops, crabmeat, and shrimp were all unimaginatively thrown together and sauteed in a butter sauce. 

Was it good? Well, yeah. To be truthful, I was starving, and the aforementioned ingredients are difficult to botch. However, combine that with a lifeless baked potato, burnt croutons, and a decent but obviously pre-fabricated Oreo mousse dessert, and I cannot give BH anything more or less than a 3. 

Kay ordered the extravagant Admiral's Seafood Platter, a smorgasbord that includes a lobster tail, scallops, shrimp, oyster shells stuffed with their Crabmeat Imperial, and filet mignon, all prepared yet again with BH's magic component, butter. She did let me taste the filet mignon, and through that morsel, I learned in splendid fashion that medium-rare is always the way to go when ordering steak. This was ideally cooked beef.  

Our server did a fine job and was a nice kid, so I have no gripes on that end.

The interiors of The Baltimore House are eccentric and vast. You never know which room you'll be seated in. There's the room with the kitschy pirate statues, a few others I cannot recall, and then the faux nightclub. 

Guess where they put us. 

My back was turned for the duration of our meal, but based on the strident, pounding 80's dance music, multicolored lights, and odd barks and hoots that assailed my senses, I thought a wild party was afoot somewhere in the house. 

When I turned around, I only saw a handful of middle-aged suburbanites at the bar. 

Before we left, our waiter revealed that there were some \"serious\" drink specials that night, particularly on Jager bombs. 

Call the babysitter. Ask her to stay a little later. Woo. Hoo. 

The Baltimore House is an oddity that fails to be extraordinarily good but is in no way egregiously bad. If they were a little less pricey, I'd recommend them as a go-to for those times when one is desperate for seafood, but being that they're in the \"Spendy\" range, I'd advise area diners to stay away like most of the other reviewers on Yelp have. 

P.S. BH also houses a restaurant-within-a-restaurant called Kazoku that specializes in Japanese fare, including teppanyaki and sushi, but they were closed when we were there Friday evening. 

P.P.S. I should have taken a picture of the opulently wacky enclosed waterfall display outside. Clark Griswald would be impressed."}
{"text":"The sushi here is a JOKE!

First off, they advertise \"Half off Sushi, 4:30 - 6:30.\"  Once that little tidbit gets you inside, you find out that it is ONLY at the bar, and it is ONLY select rolls!  I'm sorry, but that is FALSE ADVERTISING!!!

While the ingredients were fresh enough, whoever they have as their sushi chef is an amateur at best!  They were WAY off on the rice to fish ratio, and the rice was so hot, it actually started to cook the fish!

BTW, My wife enjoyed the Hibachi she had, and the Hibachi chef was very good.

I highly doubt I will ever go back."}
{"text":"The place is very different and I have never been there when they were busy. I have gone at different times so it just never seems busy. I usually get the 15.99 prime rib and crab leg special. I have never had bad crab legs from there. I also have never ordered anything other then the special. I love going there for the crab legs. Finding good crab legs in pittsburgh is not easy, they have nailed this. I've seen other food come out and it does not look bad. The place is very weird looking. It could use a refresh but it's clear they are not making enough money to do that. I will go back again and again but only because of the crab legs."}
{"text":"Very bizarre atmosphere with a broken jacuzzi under the steps, bizarre statutes every where. Went there for a lunch. Service was slow despite us being the only customers there. Had the crab cake sandwich which looked like a burger, burnt all the way. Family had the fish sandwich which they said was excellent. 

Might give it another shot"}
{"text":"The food has always been good here; but tonight (11/09/14) we never even got to taste it.  Apparently, on the same day that they advertised their AYCE shrimp and crab legs special on Facebook, they decided to start their special early, as the junior varsity football team in town (Pittsburgh Steelers) had a 1:00 pm date with mediocrity.  Subsequently, they were conveniently 'out' of the aforementioned crab legs at 7:30 pm. Not cool, considering their 'special' was advertised as running from 5:00pm to 9:00pm.  Jackass move by jackass management, in my opinion. If you advertise a special, morons, stick to it; before I drive 20 minutes to be given a bullshit excuse."}
{"text":"Ordered seafood nachos and steak salad. Hubs ordered the infamous admiral seafood platter. The nachos wweren't nachos-there we a tortilla w/ cheese and fake crab meat. My steak was ordered rare and it came out cold. The salad itself came in a taco bowl, which I hate. Hubs didn't have any huge complains but all his food was drenched in butter.  The couple that were seated behind us had ordered almost the same meal and they sent all their food back.

We were one of 3 tables in the entire restaurant and we were sitting next to each other. 

We were sitting in the non smoking section and everytime the waiter came back he smelled worse and worse like an ashtray, and I'm not normally that picky about cigarette smell.

The tacky decorations were the best thing about this place bc at least we could pose and laugh. But we will not be going back here."}
{"text":"Just downgraded from three stars. This place has gone downhill and Red Lobster has better selections and fresher fish.

Go to nearby Pan Asia instead."}
{"text":"I love food.  I eat out often and I just don't understand the bad reviews on here and have to wonder if people just look for something to complain about. 
I had bought a groupon but never used before it expired, menu looked decent enough so decided to check it out.  I instantly fell in love with the building (I don't like chains and this place is definitely different, in a wonderful way.  So much character)
We went for lunch, service was great.  Our waitress was quick on her toes and attentive, offering suggestions when asked.  When we first arrived we were the only table seated but it began to fill up and she never lost a beat.
Food was more than expected.  Lobster bisque and clam chowder both wonderful.  Cesar  and house salad great too, (it's a salad, don't understand the complaints there).  Hot rolls offered and obviously fresh.  
Seared scallops cooked to perfection.  I myself had the seafood lasagna, which was smaller than expected but after one bite I realized why... It's the real deal stuffed with seafood and speaks for itself, no reason to overcompensate.
Followed up by a shared tiramisu.  The presentation was lovely.  Again I don't get the sourpuss reviews, I'll take Baltimore house over some swanky, overpriced tourist trap any day!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Kazoku Steakhouse INSIDE the Baltimore House, which doesn't have its own page and probably for good reason. Decent food, HORRIBLE service!!!

We arrived at 5:20pm and actually thought the place was closed at first, not a soul was there.  A waitress told us to \"sit anywhere\"  and brought us drinks and menus and then 20 minutes later had us move from our empty table to another empty table where we sat, ignored for another 25 minutes.  We think they were waiting to try to \"fill up\" the table, but no one came out and said anything to us like \"We'd like to wait xx long to see if anyone else comes.\"  So, just after 6 another couple came in and was seated with us.  After they decided and placed their order, the hibachi chef confirmed our order and said that he'd \"See about starting soon\".  Our soup arrived a full hour after we'd first sat down.

The soup was good, the salad was veggies that had clearly been in the fridge cut up too long (dried out carrots, wilted greens) swimming in their dressing. No forks were provided, so everyone ate salad with fingers/chopsticks.  Finally when the chef started cooking, he broke one of the eggs so it was unusable, and didn't add another, making 3 servings of fried rice with just one egg. I was supposed to have steamed rice, but the waitress brought the me sushi rice, then took it back and brought back the steamed rice.  

The chef over cooked our rare beef, his knife was clearly not sharp enough because he had to really work to get through the veggies and our meat, we discovered, was not sliced through, and we had large chunks of meat, too big for bite-sized.

We waiting more than 15 minutes more after we were done for our check. They had cleared our plates so knew that we were done.  I had to go find a manager to get our checks and then there was a problem because they had apparently put it in all as one.  We had a PG deal coupon and the waitress repeatedly asked us what it was and where we got it.  After I complained to the manager, she gave us 1/2 off one of our meals, making it just over $40 for the entire bill, so thank goodness we had the PG Deal because that was definitely way too much for the okay food and horrible, horrible service.   They offered us the balance of the deal on a gift card and we refused, we will NEVER go back there again. The total time we were there was 2 1/2 hours and we saw our waitress a total of 4 times, before I went looking for the manager."}
{"text":"Coming to a place like this, you shouldn't be expecting a high-brow, 5-star Food Network chef kind of experience. The staff are very friendly, and the food is both quite tasty & reasonably priced! I wouldn't come here for lunch on a work day as turnaround does seem a bit slow paced, but it's a fantastic place to come and enjoy yourself when you're not in a big rush or anything! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came here because my mother had been here once with a couple of her friends.  I can beleive the other reviews that say it's gone way down hill.  And I don't think their sushi side of the business has ever seen a real sushi chef.  And whoever said that no smiles were to be had, hit the nail on the head.  If I hadn't been there with my aunt, I'd have given our waitress a good smack!  

But anyway, the fish I had was actually pretty good so there's at least one person there who knows what he's doing.  I had stuffed flounder which was served in a very hot pewter pan.  There were three pieces wrapped around some seafood stuffing.  And it was pretty good and I ate it all!  The side dishes were just so-so.  I think I had steamed veggies and something else.

All in all, it was passable but no better."}
{"text":"Disappointed and soggy

Went to the Baltimore House because they are really the only place in Pittsburgh that has whole crabs. This place is on the decline. Not packed, just 4 tables sat in dining room, but took 20 min to just get my drink. The had advertisements everywhere for a new Black Rock cooking experience but it was not yet available in spite of the menus for it placed on the tables. The crabs were mushy and overcooked. The drinks were weak and watery. The service was not great as they gave me a real hard time with my Groupon. Then the roof started leaking, water pouring down, in the middle of the dining room. 

It's never been a 5 star restaurant but I used to like this place. I really hope that the Black Rock cooking revitalizes this place if not I don't see them lasting much longer."}
