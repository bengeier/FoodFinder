{"text":"One of the best DQs I've dined at. Fast and correct service. As good as a DQ can get!"}
{"text":"Brian runs a great shop. Clean good food staff is great friendly and fast to serve you. Great meal deals as well as the frozen desserts you can take an array home too"}
{"text":"This DQ is one of the best around. Been going here for years. Always fast friendly service. Their burgers are delicious, AND, the reason for this review finally.... THEY SERVE CHOCOLATE SOFT SERVE. Finally! I no longer have to wait for the ice cream truck to come around. I don't know if every DQ offers this, but you can get it at this location for sure. That's worth 5 stars in my book.

*EDIT JUNE 2018*

-1 Star. I haven't seen Brian around in a while. Was always good when he was there. Service and quality not as good as before. I'm sure he moved on to bigger and better things but.. Brian come back! (no homo)"}
