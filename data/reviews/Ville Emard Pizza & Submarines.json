{"text":"We decided to try this place after walking by. It looked busy, and the aromas coming from the open door drew us right in. We ended up eating here two nights in a row. It is a family run restaurant that has been in business for decades.

The menu has a large variety of dishes. Poutine was excellent. The souvlaki was also amazing. The portions are huge and satisfying. The pasta was OK, but I probably wouldn't order it again.

Great service with a friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"When my wife was signing the lease for our new apartment in Cote-Saint-Paul, I took our daughter here for french fries. They rival the best fries in town! When I went back a few days later with my wife, we split a Philly-cheese sub, which was amazing, and  a plate of fries. She concurs my original assessment. So glad this is a short walk from our new home. Looking forward to trying the breakfast."}
{"text":"I've been here a total of 4 times in the past month, and wow, I have to mention what the experience is like here.

First of all it's a father and son that own and run the place, they can custom do any order you want.

Secondly, everything is homemade, from the chicken marination to the sauces, the fries... all done the good ol' fashioned way. 

Thirdly, they use excellent ingredients, and have experience in high end cooking. 

I'm really happy to have discovered this Gem in ville Emard. I'll be back for more ;-)"}
{"text":"I used to love this place,
Ordered a small cheese pizza and what I got was a really rubbery cheese pizza with a generic crust. Not what I'm used to with this place as it was once a favourite when I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Un endroit qu'on gagne à découvrir. Ils ont changé d'administration et la nourriture est excellente à très bon prix.

Pour mes diner d'affaire c'est un très bon endroit."}
{"text":"I'm still giving them 5 stars because it's still really good and quick service...but when we ordered here the other night: a smoked meat sadwich medium fat and poutine , of course, I gotta say both counts let me down unfortunately...but there's hope! 

The poutine....booooo bbq sauce gravy :( but as far as bbq sauce gravy poutines go I gotta still give it props 'cuz it had lotsa sauce and cheese curds and the fries were fresh and yummy! So now I'll hafta try n order the poutine with the gravy they use for their hamburger steak ***realllllyyyy hoping they don't use bbq sauce gravy for hamburger steak*** then it may very well still be the perfect poutine!*stay tuned* lol

The smoked meat sandwich....E for effort but dannnngg tha's some funkified smoked meat. Love that it's deli sliced. Didn't love that medium fat was wayyy toooo fatty (i would be willing to try it lean to see if it helps), but also the meat is so incredibly salty for some reason...it's very juicy so again props, but wayyy too fatty and salty. Bread and portion and price are top notch though so overall no harm no foul. I bet swiss cheese (which they offer as an extra) would fix that salty right up ;) so again *stay tuned*

Doesn't affect my opinion enough to change how good i think this place is...Will definitely be seeing what else they got!"}
{"text":"The place feels a little cramped, but they have absolutely incredible food! I am very glad my friends told me to order the small pizza, \"petíte\", as it was enormous. When a hamburger is $4.50 CAD and a small pizza is $16-something, you know you're in for a treat. Before the food arrived, our server pulled an additional table over next to ours... to hold my \"small\" pizza. When it came out, my jaw dropped. It was huge  (I don't know; ~12\"?), thick (~2cm crust), and LOADED with toppings of 4+ different meats. Our server then gave me a plate equal in size to the one holding the pizza, and used the two large spoons that had been resting on the pizza to serve me a single slice from it (one-quarter of the pizza) and scoop back up all the toppings that had fallen off. The flavor was incredible! The bread, cheese, and meats all had the perfect amounts of moisture (grease) with none having too much or possessing an appearing oily. One slice was more than enough to fill me up, but because, as I said at the time, \"It will never be as good later as it is now,\" I managed to put down another half slice before admitting defeat to this mighty and meat-laden pie."}
{"text":"I decided to grab a pizza from this place on a whim. I must say the meat lovers offers an insane amount of meat . I love me some meat on my pizza, but this may have exceeded even my meat desires. The crust was great, sauce was good and not sweet. 2 pieces wad the most I could possibly eat (out of a small)

I will definitely try this place again, although something a little less heavy will be my next choice."}
{"text":"Probably THE best pizza in the city next to New Systems.  Their breakfast meal is amazing too.  Seasoned eggs, sausage, bacon, hash browns, fresh fruit.  The full package.

But definitely ask for their pizza.   It's heavenly!"}
{"text":"Ne vous fiez pas au nom du resto.  Enfin partiellement, car VEP est beaucoup plus qu'une pizzeria de quartier, leur menu offre un quantité de gourmet de qualité.

L'un des co-propriétaire est un chef et aime la qualité et la fraîcheur des aliments.  Fort de ses expériences de chef entrepreneur avec l'ex B&B Steak House sur McGill et bien d'autres, il apporte au traditionnel et délicieuses pizzas de quartier et \"mets canadiens\" rapides, un carte pour d'excellent souper en famille et ami dans une salle à manger rénovée.
Ils vous servent entre autre, des scalipinni cachator, du pollo vinezo et un menu de pâtes et sauces et garnitures que vous combinez à votre choix!    En plus de mets grecs traditionnelle et maison.
 Ah oui!  C'est un apportez votre vin et bière!   Génial! 

Un des must ici est leur sous-marins juteux et généreux bien enveloppés dans l'alluminium pour préserver goût et chaleur.
 
Ils sont les Rois de la Frites du Sud-ouest et leur pizza est délicieuse et oui, c'est du resto :)   En livraison et takeout vous aurez la classique boule de pâtes au milieu de votre pizza!

On y sert d'excellents, originaux et copieux petits déjeûners les samedis et dimanches.

Envie d'un dessert?  Ils ont une excellente carte de tartes et gâteaux des meilleurs pâtisseries du Sud-ouest et NDG!

En terminant.  Pour ma part, je n'ai pas grand chose de négatif à dire, je me sens comme chez moi et on m'accueille comme si je fais parti de la famille.   Le chef tient à la qualité du service de son équipe autant que des aliments!  Le service est des plus courtois et impécable.

Je leur ferait une seule suggestion:  ajuster la clim l'été, sinon longue vie à VEP!"}
{"text":"The pizza was okay, not great. To be honest it was a little expensive for what it was. We had the special, all dressed plus bacon and onions. 

At least the delivery was fast, but overall it was a pretty greasy and overpriced pizza."}
{"text":"Wow un autre resto caché et méconnu d'assez bonne qualité avec un service de classe, serveuses attentionnées. J'etais de passage et j'ai pris l'assiette souvlaki aux brochettes de poulet qui venait avec soupe et petite salade cesar, le tout avec des ingredients frais et savoureux. Belle surprise. En plus pas cher du tout !!

6 mois plus tard: Je suis retourné pour leur pizza format bambino est c'est ok et le service toujours aussi attentionné.... pour moi ça sent la bonne gerance et le bon chef  derriere tout ca !! Merci à tout le staff !!"}
