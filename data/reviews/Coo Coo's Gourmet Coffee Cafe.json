{"text":"Amazing.  With the drive.  I'll be back.  Panini is amazing!  Glad we stopped in.  Thank you!  Yum yum."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I'd give it a 3 out of 5. The breakfast food there is great, other than that I wasn't too impressed. I ordered a smoothie once that had kiwi and other fruits.. well most of the \"fruit\" they used in it was a fruit flavored syrup.. Not tasty at all. Bagel sandwiches are great and cookies are good half of the time. I've ordered sandwiches and you can tell the turkey was packaged or fake."}
{"text":"Coo Coo's is a great small town cafe in the heart of Downtown Henderson.  This a very friendly cafe that has sandwiches, salads, malts and coffee.  They have board games and magazines for you to pass the time with while you are waiting for your meal.  My kids love the bbq chicken sandwich, and they recommend it"}
{"text":"Food is always good but the man who runs it is not the friendliest. Cute little spot in downtown Henderson."}
{"text":"I am a regular lunch eater at  Coo Coo's. We actually got delivery probably 2-3x a week while I worked a mile away. My favorite sandwiches are the california on the toasted sub roll (so good with the avocado and sprouts..) and the Roast Beef melt (ask for extra horseradish sauce!). Always great and friendly service."}
{"text":"Had a rather unpleasant experience with coo coo's... although the food is to die for, the owner wasn't very helpful, in fact,  it felt like he was getting very impatient as I was trying to decide which sandwich to go for.  It was 2:30 pm, I was the only customer in  the restaurant and yet he couldn't  \"spare me another minute\" to decide. ( It's a good thing the croissant/BLT and the  20 oz. ice blended caramel macchiato were excellent)"}
{"text":"I went here on small business Saturday and had one of the best sandwiches ever! I had a turkey sandwich and added avocado. The portions are huge and everything is very fresh and it is such high quality! It is such a cute place to eat as well. There are board games and coloring books to entertain children and it has a very old school 50s feel to it."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything that I've tried is pretty tasty  The delivery people are friendly and fast. The building itself is very small however an awesome place to grab a coffee and wonder around water st."}
{"text":"I eat at coo coos regularly. Great food. Great service. Great local Small business. The california sandwich is the best! The blondie is great too."}
{"text":"The perfect lunch spot.  Tiny, local, black and white tile floors, red seated chairs.  But the best part is that the food is fresh, fresh, fresh.  Second, it is always good. Third, you don't have to buy monster sized portions--they will reduce the portion size and the price.  When you get a sandwich you get a small chocolate chip cookie--just the size to sweeten the whole day.  You will always get a smile.  The Senor Pedro salad is fantastic with crisp bacon and the usual taco salad combination.  The turkey sandwich is perfect and there's a huge selection of salads, sandwiches, wraps, breads, beverages.  The breakfast menu looks great as well.  In this world of plastic food, mass produced, this place is a gem."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the outside. Once you enter, the cafe it's super cute with mid century decor. They have so many sandwiches/wraps and smoothies to choose from. The funky monkey was delicous made up of a blended mocha and a banana. My husband and I both ordered the California sandwich and were pleasantly delighted with them. You also get to choose from fruits, macaroni salad, potato salad, and chips as your side. I will definitely go back when we're in town."}
{"text":"Coo Coo's is the best place to get anything! Their coffee in any form is better'n starbux! Their food is awesome I think Ive had close to everything on the menu Cuban Sandwich, subs, Breakfast bagel san. its all so delicious and the help is nice! Even the owner is nice can I say it in how many ways, GO!"}
{"text":"I love this place. One of my favorite spots to go when I have time to grab breakfast. Have so many things to try. My favorite are the wraps. So cute. The customer service is like no other. If I could afford to go every day I would!"}
{"text":"We often order from Coo Coo's Cafe on Fridays. Always a great experience! I really enjoy their chicken quesadilla, nachos, and their chicken ranch sandwich depending on what I'm in the mood for. Give Coo Coo's a try! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Place is legit! I had the best damn bagel breakfast sammich of my life!  Coffee is pretty good too. Service was friendly and quick. Made for an excellent breakfast stop."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee drinks. I'm not kidding...maybe the best vanilla latte I've ever had. Great menu. I got a bagel sandwich that was very yummy and the fruit cup that accompanied was very fresh."}
{"text":"Food so fresh You can taste it. Food is fantastic, restaurant is clean, prices are affordable,  service is thorough and quick. You dont stay in business as long as they have by being mediocre."}
{"text":"Had the chance of eating here, and I will return. It's a small place and has only about 3 or f4 tables. But what it lacks in size, it makes up for in friendliness and food."}
{"text":"Best little breakfast/lunch place in Henderson. We have never been disappointed here. Highly recommend any of the breakfast sandwiches. They are the BEST! Pretty fast delivery too."}
{"text":"Their 50's theme carries well throughout the whole restaurant. I love supporting family-run businesses, and this one has a lot of heart and character. I feel like this would make for one epic date night! The food is good. Oh, and their milkshakes are delish :) I would recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"It was alright.. not the best breakfast place i have been. The place is small and tight.   My side order of potato salad is not really good, looks like mashed salad.  the sandwich i had is decent.   But there smoothies are good.   I find it it quite expensive."}
{"text":"During a recent trip to Vegas I decided to venture out for a hole in the wall brunch spot. I found this place on Yelp (naturally), however I was a little disappointed because one of the descriptive words for this place is \"British\". When I got there and asked the guy at the counter he had no problem letting me know they were DEFINATELY not British and had no idea why it says so on Yelp.  Anyhow, I proceeded to order several of the 'All Day Breakfast' dishes....one was the Hearty and the other was the Belgium Waffle breakfast. Both tasted good however as much as I enjoy eggs, there was enough for 10 people and they had a lot of cheese making them rather sickly. The Hearty breakfast has a choice of 2 slices of ham OR 6 slices of bacon or Sausages, I asked for the ham. I would have MUCH preferred a mixture of all because after a few minutes I had grown tired of the ham and the mountain of egg.  I don't live anywhere close to here so I probably wont be back, but I think I was mostly disappointed in the fact that I drove there anticipating a full traditional British breakfast."}
{"text":"Coo Coo's is my absolute favorite place for breakfast and lunch in the heart of Henderson. Paul, the owner, is friendly as well as his staff. It's got a cute 50s theme throughout the cafe. It's hard for me to pick a favorite dish, but I have say that the tuna melt on wheat bread is to die for. Perfect for a cold day. The famous Funky Monkey Frappe tastes wonderful and definitely gives you a kick if you're sensitive to caffeine.  I posted a photo of their breakfast burrito and although it looks small, it is delicious and the perfect size for me! Highly recommend to anyone who is in downtown Henderson."}
{"text":"My first bite melted into my mouth! I ordered the breakfast croissant with bacon! The bacon was perfectly cooked! And tasted like the good brand you buy at the store and cook on a lazy morning! Service was fast and friendly! The shop has a diner/malt sho feel! Definitely recommend if you're on Water St. and looking for a small like breakfast place to eat at!"}
{"text":"quaint little place pretty good food. Sometimes I feel like the owner can be borderline rude."}
{"text":"Good customer service! And definitely a great place to stop by for a delicious sandwich! The Cali sub is amazing"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!  Delicious fresh food and great customer service.  It is not a fast food place but they get it too you quickly.  This is a must try place."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite I come here often sense I live right down the street. The price is a little high I got a califorina spinach wrap, a cookie, macaroni salad and water for $10. But is is worth the money. Food tastes great and the people here are nice. The place could use a bit of an update though the style is 80s theme but a new coat of paint and ceiling tiles would do wonders for the place. Overall great little place for food and to hang out for a little with friends.  Food 4/5 Customer Service 5/5 Building 3/5"}
{"text":"I was excited to finally be able try Coo Coo's with the GF so we decided to try it for lunch.  After walking in I was impressed with atmosphere of this tiny establishment.  That was until we placed our order...  There is a lot to choose from on the menu.  Sometimes when experiencing an eatery for the first time, I get a little menu vertigo.  My safety net is usually someone behind the counter asking me if this is my first time and offering up a suggestion or at the bare minimum giving me a friendly greeting.  The gentleman (the one in charge) with sort of an intense aura offered none.  This now puts me on edge because if I walk into your business and am going to spend my hard earned cash there I kind of expect some sort of salutation.  Putting that all aside I ordered up Coo Coo's Deli Club.  This I must say was damn good sandwich consisting of Salami, Turkey, Ham, Cheddar, Provolone, Lettuce, Tomato and Mayo on a French Roll.  Everything tasted fresh and delicious.  The GF had a Tuna Salad Melt on a wheat Panini.  It also tasted delicious.  Together we shared a peanut butter shake.  When it was time to leave no farewells or \"Thank you for comings\" were issued.  The lack of any type of customer courtesies and not the food are the reason for the two star review.  Sometime in the future I may try again and hope to catch the gentleman in better spirits."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in here the other day when we ended up out in old Henderson and hungry. I hate fast food joints so we searched for a while to find something interesting, and Hubby picked this place out (and I'm glad he did).  Vague 50s Diner decor, theme isn't overblown, and the place looked pretty clean. We went up to the counter and ordered a single Italian sub to share then waited at our table for it to be served. And waited... and waited... and then we were rewarded for our patience.  The sub was huge, and they split it onto two plates without us asking (which was nice!). I had to unhinge my jaw a notch or two to get a bite from my sandwich, but it was worth it - one of the absolute best Italian subs I've ever had, and I've had a lot (they're our favorite).  Seriously, the sub was amazing.  The other reviewers mention great breakfasts and coffee, but I don't know why more people weren't packing in there for their lunch subs. Based on what I tasted, they should have had a line out the door.   So, while we live in NW Las Vegas and this diner is about as far away as you can get and still be in the Valley, we'll be going back."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough.  It's a small place near water street by a used book store/trade shop.  I used to march in the water street parades in highschool and I'd stop here and get a smoothie and a snack. PERFECT!  They have great smoothies, they use fine coffee syrups, their iced coffees are excellent. The inside is quaint and cute. It's 50's-inspired to me. It's family owned and operated.  I was surprised to find that they deliver. So I was visiting my mom at work and they told me to call them and order for us and her co-workers. Everyone was pleased! Everything I've tried here - smoothies, coffees, pastries, sandwiches - has been wonderful."}
{"text":"They're open bright and early and ready to serve breakfast at 6am!!  This local favorite has bee here forever.  My kids use to come here when they went BMS back in the day. You can always count on a good cooked to order breakfast or lunch.  Recent visit I had the Belgian Waffle breakfast that included scrambled eggs w/cheese and chose bacon for my choice of meat.  It took a lil long for the order to come out, but I didn't mind since I knew it was made to order.  Waffle was really good. I like the batter they used.  Texture was light and fluffy. Every bite with whip cream and fresh strawberries was yummy.  I always found the owner Paul and his staff pleasant. I liked how they recently extended the space and added a dining area. Even with construction and orange cone zones constantly plaguing on the area on Pacific St, you can find a place to park."}
{"text":"Deceptive 5 star reviews. Ordered a breakfast burrito. Probably the smallest I've ever seen in my 31 years of life. Husband got a Belgian waffle. Was decent, nothing notably star raising. Also a side of eggs and bacon. Eggs were suspiciously un-egg-like. Assume they are of the eggs in a carton variety. Wouldn't know, never tried them. Bacon was nice and crispy.   For drinks, 2 frappes. Vanilla and a German chocolate. Lacking any distinction from any other coffee shop. Suppose it would be convenient for people working and living nearby, but it's definitely not a 5 star joint by any means. Bit overpriced too now that I think about it."}
{"text":"This is a great little place to stop into to eat delicious food and get away from the craziness of Vegas! We ordered the California wrap and the waffle breakfast...so good! The wrap was really filling, so I ate the second half for dinner. The waffles were perfect. Really friendly, welcoming staff and on a cute little middle-of-nowhere feeling street. Totally recommend if you're in the mood for some quality casual, diner-style dining!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. If you've ever looked for that hole in the wall place that had good food and a good atmosphere look no further. Its small and cozy and nastalgic and clean and did I mention that the food is great. There's board games and families laughing and cutting up. You will find that the management and staff are very friendly. Absolutely in love with this place."}
{"text":"Love the chili cheese nachos. Always friendly and have never had anything that was not good. The California sandwich is amazing as well. Would recommend anyone to go to Coo Coos."}
{"text":"Love this little shop. Everything I have ordered always tastes great and coffee is good too."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly and appreciative staff, fun place and food is good too!  We had California Burritos - TASTY!  Played Yahtzee while we were there."}
{"text":"Downtown Henderson.  I really liked this place. It's next to a bookstore, and what could be better than that. I am fuzzy on remembering the decor, but it's small and quaint. Nice extensive menu with breakfast stuff served all day - always a bonus to me! They had a little bit of outside seating as well, which is perfect in the current season before it gets too hot.  I had a friend who was supposed to meet me, and unfortunately, I had forgotten my phone, and she had forgotten about lunch, so I was hanging around a bit. The owner, who has been termed as crusty or unfriendly, was very sweet to me, he even offered his phone so I could call my friend. Unfortunately, my memory loss kicked in and I couldn't remember her number.   In the end, I ordered the Coo Coo's Super Bird Panini. To be my unusual self, I left off the Dijonnaise and Tomato, and had them add the Cran-Mayo (from the Ocean Spray sandwich) which went extremely well with the Turkey, Swiss, and Bacon (isn't EVERYTHING better with bacon?) and I had the Sourdough bread. For my side, I up charged to get a cup of the chicken noodle soup.   The sandwich was stellar, especially with my Sally-like ordering, juicy turkey, nicely melted cheese, crunchy bacon, and the nice tinge of cranberry with the mayo, yum! The sourdough was properly panini'd and no burn.   :) The chicken soup was especially good, nothing like Campbell's or Costco or anything out of a can. It had excellent flavor and a nice balance of chicken to noodle to veggies, or what-have-you that was in it.   There was a steady stream of customers in and out getting drinks and lunch to go, you can tell they do a lot of local business. Right next to me were some folks from local law enforcement (it's near the Henderson courthouse, after all.)    The staff were very nice to me even though I hung out for a half hour before giving up on my friend and ordering. They didn't give the vibe that they were impatient with me at all. As I said, the owner was really nice; I wouldn't have recognized any of the previous Yelpers description of him.  Back to the food, I saw a Chef Salad delivered to customers outside that looked gorgeous in presentation. It made me want one!  No fries on the menu, as others have stated, and I'm not a huge Mac salad, chips, or potato salad kind of girl, and fruit cups is too healthy for me, but the ability to switch up to a cup of that fabulous soup worked great for me!  I will be back, hopefully with the friend who suggested the location and eats here frequently! She was pretty apologetic about forgetting, but no big deal, I got to really check out the place."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how much I love this place. The delivery is lightning quick, the food is so fresh and healthy, there are smoothies, wraps, salads, sandwiches, breakfast. It's a breakfast and lunch place serving downtown Henderson. I love it so much, everything is awesome. Prices are super reasonable too. Its cheaper for me to order the huge garden salad for lunch, than it is to make it every day with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Gourmet coffee cafe huh? They buy their coffee from Einstein's bagels. I've noticed the cartons before, but a few weeks ago I saw them putting the coffee into their carafes to serve the customers. Really? How hard is it to brew your own coffee?"}
{"text":"It's a cute, fifties style diner and we stopped in for a cappuccino and a bite of good home cooking. It was nothing better than a continental breakfast that might be served at a hotel. We ordered Belgian waffles and a petite platter. The eggs and waffle tasted like they came from a box, and the grits tasted like the Styrofoam cup they were served in. From the plastic cutlery to Styrofoam glasses, I just can't find anything I enjoyed about the place."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! great food great service, old school Henderson vibe. All day breakfast!! Good coffee! A hidden gem."}
{"text":"Best Chi in Henderson.  Their coffee is not bad either.  Very good place for lunch."}
{"text":"such a cute cafe, the food and coffee were amazing & i took super adorable pictures in there. i got the belgian waffle with fruit & it was delicious! i would also recommend their caramel macchiato, it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Such a fun secluded spot for a cafe!! Hidden little gem!!!! BF had a Italian sub and i had tuna sub on french roll FANTASTIC!!!! and the Bouncing Brit drink was SOOOOO GOOD!!!!! Can't wait to go back!!! Super excited now that we know its there!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the charm of the businesses on or near Water St.   I had a mad craving for some deli food and I scoured Yelp until I found this gem. I was thrilled when I saw that they delivered! Straight to my house came a friendly delivery girl, who I happily and hungrily greeted. I had an amazing sandwich full of avocado, turkey, and sprouts. I had an amazing iced coffee drink that mixed bananas and chocolate. I want to say it's called the Funky Monkey? My son also had a taste-packed sandwich but I can't recall what I ordered him as I was busy with my own luscious meal. (sorry kid, Mommy DOES love you..almost as much as she loves food)  Since that first delivery experience, I've taken friends for smoothies and ice cream, and they appreciated the fact that there were many smoothie options not including dairy or soy, and with an array of fruit combos.   Definitely my choice when I want a deli feel, with added perks of ice cream, smoothies, and coffee drinks to lust over.   Even better? They dont mind showing up at my doorstep ready to hand over my food, even when I look like a crazed, caffeine deprived maniac."}
{"text":"As others have said, don't be afraid of the outside appearance or the size of the place when you walk in.  This place is a hidden gem.  Great for lunch and looks great for shakes and smoothies.  I have had different lunch specials twice now and they didn't disappoint.  I will definitely be back and will put this place on my regular lunch rotation.  Wish I would have had room for the special M&M shake today as it looked REALLY good!  See you soon Coo Coo's!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this little cafe located on the newly refurbished downtown area off of Water Street in Old Henderson. Highly recommended for its excellent, fresh menu and great service. We just had the alfalfa sandwich on lightly toasted sourdough bread with a nice slice of fresh avocado and the fresh fruit cup. Chocolate chip cookie comes with the meal. Wonderful place to meet for a friendly conversation or a first date. Someone who looked like a lawyer was enjoying a cup of coffee while he worked on a legal pad close-by. They feature 80's music for semi-privacy. It reminds us of a small Happy Days cafe, without the noisy crowd. Try Coo Coo's you will love it!"}
{"text":"Delicious food for a good price.  Great service to boot! Real personality. Try the waffles  - really good!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place that serves breakfast late while our vehicle was at the shop. We thought we'd check on Yelp to see what was recommended in Henderson. Coo Coo's is a cute little diner with excellent food and smiling staff and reasonable prices. We had the breakfast burrito and coffee. Another great thing about this place is that it is in the old part of Henderson, it seems like a small Nevada town up north. It felt like we were \"away\" somewhere. The old time movie posters and memorabilia added to the ambiance."}
{"text":"March 26, 2015:  This is a nice, cozy place where you are welcomed when you come into the cafe. My friend and I had a smoothie and we enjoyed it! We plan to come back again and next time we will be having lunch there. NOTE: We came into the cafe on 3/26/15 but I'm only now posting due to time constraints."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always great, but the customer service sometimes leaves things to be desired. The salads are always fresh and everything comes out quickly. Retro feeling place and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's like walking into the past, but it's in the present?...Ouch my brain.   Imagine you're Marty McFly and you just got zapped back to 1955; well that's the vibe this place has as soon as you walk in. Black and white checkerboard floors, red leather bound booths and chairs with multiple old school movie posters on the walls. \"This is getting heavy doc.\"  This place is very tiny with only two booths and a few chairs, so you better not come here during the lunch rush or you're eating in your car. If you're on the run and need a bite, Coo Coo Cafe does offer phone-in orders that you can pick-up on the way to you're next appointment or if you wan to eat at home while you enjoy reruns on TV. \"What's a rerun?\"  With plenty of parking outside, I pulled up, walked in and met the owner, who by the way also takes your food order. This dude has a salty demeanor, but I can tell he's the \"big soft teddy bear\" type. No messing around though, just order your food and sit down...cool with me I'm starving! I went with what he said was the, \"local favorite\" the Cali Sub w/ sprouts, avocado, turkey, bacon and swiss cheese. On paper this sounds pretty basic, but it was very fresh and piled high (see photo) with lots of goodies, plus the bread was super soft. Plush in the middle and toasted on top by a sandwich press. Let's be real, the bread can make or break a good sammie, right?!?!  \"That's right butt head\"  To wash it all down I ordered the \"Kiwi Kooler\" smoothie. This had a great presentation, but was a little on the sweet side for my taste so I only drank about half. All-in-all this place was a hit for me and my tastebuds.  \"Great Scott!\"  I will be coming back to check out other Coo Coo Cafe food options from their simple, but surprising menu.  \"Now, let's get back...to the future!\""}
{"text":"I have ordered from CooCoos for over 12 years and they are always consistently good. Staff is friendly and delivery is quick. With any luck, 12 years from now I'll still be going here."}
{"text":"I just moved to Henderson from Oregon, and I have been searching for a coffee place I can call my favorite. This place is officially my favorite and the bobba tea is amazing."}
{"text":"Nice locally owned spot. More personality than all the chains and franchises in the area. I would have given it 3.5 if I could, tho. The latte was served in a common styrofoam cup, rather than ceramic mug, even tho I said I was having it to stay. I was given a plastic fork rather than metal utensil. There was no milk or cream in a pitcher; only cheap plastic chemically-no-refrigeration-needed-faux-cream. The sandwich was just ok, but not awesome--as I hoped for. The music was really crappy, crass radio station instead of anything original or cool. But kudos for being an independent business in downtown Henderson! My guess is the people who work there maybe don't really understand how important it is to stand apart from all the cookie-cutter corporate-owned places---but I would hope that the owner does, and makes sure the staff understands more about how to live up to the potential of how special this place could be. I would drive 5 miles regularly to come here if they made these fixes, and bring friends and colleagues."}
{"text":"I am soo disappointed! I was so excited to find a cute little cafe near my daughters school. Ordered the Super Bird to go and I was utterly disgusted. Took a bite and spit it out, which I never waste food like that. The Turkey was gamy and tasted like I was eating rotten turkey. I was so disappointed I payed for it. I will not go back. Ugh. I still have a terrible taste from it."}
{"text":"It says home of the famous funky monkey... I just moved here from California so a funky monkey is what i drank almost everyday from it's a grind. Tried the funky monkey here.... I took 1 sip and it tastes like alcohol the banana  must have been rotten... the funky monkey in Cali comes with peanut butter also so I put some peanut butter in it myself... and nope... still taste terrible... i only drank maybe like 5 sips and threw it away i couldnt finish it is was so disgusting....I just wasted 6 bucks.... absolutley terrible frapp. Never again."}
{"text":"Great food.  When your looking for diners drive ins and  dives,  you have found your diner!"}
{"text":"This place has such good quality food. I love the idea of it being a small neighborhood restaurant, and having a surprisingly high quality of food. The staff is friendly, the food is priced well, and the service is quick!  They are very accommodating. I would be very upset if this restaurant was't here anymore.  You get a lot for your money. I would say the food is gourmet! Although my pablo salad does come with iceberg lettuce, it is beyond delicious."}
{"text":"I look for any excuse to get coffee here. There's not many places in Henderson that know how to make a latte. This place is the best. And they are quick. I love the breakfast. All fresh made food.  And they make Italian sodas. It's a quiet, chill place with nice employees."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and coffee and not impressed. Coffee was awful, tasted like dirt. Smoothie was good. Breakfast sandwiches were just ok. Quick service and she was friendly. Owner-manger was loudly ordering supplies on the phone in the front space. Not recommended."}
{"text":"This little place was a gem. Really amazing sandwich...ordered the California I believe it was called. Really fresh and delicious. I look forward to returning to try some breakfast items! It was surprisingly crowded-ish for a random Tuesday at like 11:30 am. I appreciated the menu being tidy and to the point which made me feel like....ok, what they offer; they must do well! Did not disappoint. I think this little downtown Henderson area will be revived and receiving the love it deserves pretty soon here. Bravo Coo Coo's! Also as a side note, finished the sandwich like 7 hours later and the bread held up like a champ!!!! Boom! That too me is like makes for a for sure bomb sandwich. Sprouts offered is a huge yummy plus."}
{"text":"Great little old time diner. Driven past it a million times at night after closing. Finally got to go in for lunch. Got a tuna melt and my wife got the Santa Fe wrap. My tuna was 1/2 inch thick. Very filling with Lays chips and a homemade cookie. Got a large (32 oz.) milkshake, handmade with real ice cream, to split and it was great. The wife's side of macaroni salad was average. Lots of things to go back and try."}
{"text":"We had 2 lunches, and a bagel there this weekend, total of 5 items over 2 days. All items were awesome. Made to order, fresh, crisp veggies on the sandwich items. Nachos were surprisingly good too. Not the cheapest eats in Downtown Henderson, but among the best."}
{"text":"Cool old cafe in downtown Henderson. There are not many vegan options. I ended up getting just avocado on bread."}
{"text":"So I've come here a couple more times since my original review and they never disappoint!! Thickly sliced meet and fresh ingredients with perfectly toasted bread... That makes a great Sammy! Kudos to Coo Coo's!"}
{"text":"cute little hole in the wall place. pretty decent food for the prices, very friendly staff. a couple of coworkers and i frequented here often and still go on occasion for some italian sodas! they offer delivery, you can call ahead or you can walk right in. sometimes the wait times drag on but thats understandable considering theres hardly any room in there and the staff on hand is very minimum. i would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a quick reasonably priced meal!"}
{"text":"I'm only rating the food: ordered the coo coos turkey sandwich and husband got the grilled muffin with frosting on top (I believe they called it a cinnabon). My turkey meat taster like gelatin. Very poor quality meat, tasted very cheap.   Husband generally likes his muffin. Tasted like a regular muffin heated up. Probably wouldn't come back here, nothing special"}
{"text":"Yummy fod, great little spot to grab home made good food!"}
{"text":"Big Bang  Having just returned several pounds heavier from vacation, I was starved for some breakfast.  My friend and I sifted through Yelp and found this gem.  Actually, we passed it a couple of times before we found it.  I swear if we weren't looking for it, we'd not have known it existed.  I'm very excited to have found this little diner in downtown Hendo, and to support locally owned business.  I ordered a cup of coffee and simple petite platter, consisting of bacon, scrambled eggs, toast and fruit cup.    The coffee, to my surprise, was illy, which is my favorite brand of espresso grounds.  Definitely earned points with me.  My friend commented that it was on the strong side, while I thought it was a little weaker than my preference.  Don't get me wrong, I brew my coffee to be like oil and drink the sludge that comes out with the last pour, so when I say it's weak, take it with a packet of sugar,    The platter was generously sized, with a big smattering of eggs and a shit ton of bacon.  If you know me, the way to my stomach is to clog my arteries with bacon grease.  I swear there were about 6 pieces of bacon on my plate (maybe I looked like I could use a few more pounds).    Good thing, though, because the eggs were not very...tasty.  My mother in law adds milk to her eggs to make them fluffy, but these eggs seemed to have a bit too much.  Ketchup was required to make them more appetizing...hence deducting 2 stars.    The fruit cup was a nice touch, with orange slices, cantaloupe and grapes to offset the bacon fat.  Not necessary, but welcome in my belly.  Throw in the toast and you have a breakfast.    As a whole, this was a filling breakfast and did the job.  Sure, the eggs weren't all they were cracked up to be (sorry, I couldn't help but be punny), but when you consider that this entire meal cost just pennies over $7 per person after tax, you get quite a bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Very nice to have what seemed like a homemade meal.  Excellent soup.  Enjoyed being able to sit outside and eat lunch.  Definitely not like all the pre made food you get from most restaurants in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"My first visit and I was thoroughly impressed! It's a cute little cafe with delicious food! I ordered the petite breakfast plate (that wasn't really that petite!!) comes with 2 scrambled eggs, toast, fruit or grits, and your choice of bacon sausage or ham! For $5.85 it wasn't too bad! Their scrambled eggs are unlike anything I've ever had before! Really yummy and fluffy! Their bacon is average but I didn't mind it. I also tried their Monkey Frappe which is advertised as \"Home of the Famous Monkey Frappe!\" I expected it to be really sugary but it was the perfect amount of coffe taste with just the right amount of sugar in it. . The one guy that works here can come off somewhat rude but I think that's just his personality. Overall great dining experience! Service by the employees was average, but nothing too exceptional."}
{"text":"Decided I needed a caffeinated refreshment to make my drive back to Summerland.   Popped in to Coo Coos and the choices were abundant.   They offer approximately 12 sugar free flavors in addition to the 15-20 sugary ones. Thumbs up for options!   The guy was friendly. I was there a grand total of 2 minutes before I got my sugar free brown sugar cinnamon ice blended latte. Served in a big cup with cinnamon sprinkled on top $4.53.   Really cute place!"}
{"text":"Have yet to be disappointed with my orders. Very prompt and friendly service. Seems a little pricey, but I think it's probably comparable to most places nowadays. I go here at least once a month for a Boba or Funkey Monkey."}
{"text":"Adding a star after my second visit. I found a coupon for $1 off a drink in the Henderson paper, so I decided to give Coo Coo's another try today.   Service with a smile is always nice, but when it's at 6:30 am it's even nicer then normal. I gave the cashier my coupon and asked for a recommendation. I was told that the Funky Monkey Frappe was the specialty so that is what I went with. I got the small (20 oz), after my coupon my total was just over $3. WAY cheaper then Starbucks!  The Funky Monkey Frappe is a blended mocha frappe with a banana added, complete with whipped cream and sprinkles on top. It's like a combination between a smoothie and a frappuccino. I can see why this is the specialty.   I will be back, even if I don't have a coupon."}
{"text":"You gotta love these locally owned cafes.  I sure do, especially when it's in Old Henderson. With a ton of coffee shops that boomed in the last 10 years like Starbucks and Coffee Bean, it's a breath of fresh air to see one of these older cafes still around.  Coo Coo's is definitely one of those hidden gems in the area.    Known for smoothies, coffee, deserts, and sandwiches.  It's actually their boba, that I came in for.  I was in the area and met up with T-Elite for a quick boba fix.  To be honest, I needed to break that \"2:30 feeling\". I had their Almond Smoothie w/Boba to do exactly that.  This treat was creamy and tasted exactly like almonds.  Imagine the initial taste of an Almond Roca.  Now imagine the taste and feel of boba immediately after that Almond Roca taste.  Well, that's exactly what you get here. Simply delicious!!  There is a wide selection of different sandwiches that you can get here.  Coo Coo's is small and can house a couple of groups inside, but there's also seating outside.  I say take advantage when the weather is good and eat outside.   I'm in this area at least once a month usually for work, the Henderson Police Department, and to visit both Wonder Twins (aka Alicia R and Terri R).  When in the area and if I'm in the mood for boba, I know Coo Coo's will be there to satisfy my cravings."}
{"text":"Delish!! We had California sub it was so fresh and such a large portion. Came with a great macaroni salad and even a choco chip cookie! We will return there again!"}
{"text":"Got the California wrap,  and all I can say is wow! Super good! Almost couldn't eat it all it was so big!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered vanilla lattes after reading a prior review that said they had the best vanilla latte at coo coo's. I was definitely not disappointed. The latte was delicious, not too sweet and very delicious. He also had a strawberry waffle he was very happy with, crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Very happy with coo coo's, it's close to home and will definitely be replacing my trips to Starbucks."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is delicious & the people are so unbelievably nice. So many food options & it's great for vegetarians & vegans!"}
{"text":"Coo coo's always has the best service and mocha fraps. A great Sunday breakfast getaway."}
{"text":"Adorable, quaint little jewel in the center of Water Street District. I'd much rather give this place my business than any corporate coffee company.   The price was right, certainly not more expensive than Starbucks. A regular size flavored latte cost me $4.10, the same would cost me $4.27 at Starbucks. I'm happy with that.   The flavors are endless here, they seem to carry every flavor Torani manufactures. :) My service was polite and to the point.   Maybe it was the regulars eyeing me down when I walked in, or the lack of help I got trying to choose a flavor (you have to try to read the bottles, there isn't a list of flavors here), but I just didn't get the 5 star customer service here. Maybe I will get it the next time I come in, because I'm coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a new coffee place for a little bit and stumbled upon this shop on yelp. I've also recently become addicted to Boba. Which is what I ordered this morning. It's delicious and light with plenty of Boba. The interior Decour was comfortable and cute. And the help was really pleasant.   I also saw the food being served up and not only was it super affordable ,but looked delicious and was made to order. They also have an open kitchen which I always really like. I will definitely definitely be back to give that a try as well."}
{"text":"Good food at a fair price. Coffee drinks are ok but not fantastic. I eat there maybe 2x per month"}
{"text":"My favorite little place in the water street district ! Love it ! Fast delivery! Everything is so yummy . I love the French dip and the breakfast sandwich on the bagels."}
{"text":"My tip best summarizes why am a fan of Coo Coo's Cafe:       \" The best scrambled eggs that I've had in a restaurant the past decade; or come to think of it ever.\"      Coo Coo's is an appropriate name. You can say that I am coo coo for their scrambled eggs. Maybe with the exception of my grandfather's scrambled eggs, Coo Coo's is hitherto now the champion of scrambled eggs (in my opinion ). The two breakfasts that Coo Coo's served me this year featured scrambled eggs. I ordered the Hearty breakfast plate ($6.99) one visit and the smaller Petite breakfast plate ($5.39) the other visit. For $6.99 the Hearty breakfast plate with a coffee costing an additional  $1.95 is a grand deal. The Hearty Breakfast Plate includes three scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese. Coo Coo's Cafe made me aware that cheddar cheese with scrambled eggs is a winning combination. The cheddar cheese was equally as tasty as the scrambled eggs. I'd choose six slices of Apple Wood smoked bacon over two thick cut slices of ham or two sausage patties. I wasn't coo coo over the bacon. They were good. However, I have tasted better bacon. I'd choose sordough over wheat toast. In my opinion toast is toast. Being adventurous I tried grits. My memory has zero recollection of ever trying grits before I had breakfast in Coo Coos. When the food is good, it is a good time to try something new because you will be experiencing a quality portion of the food. Complimenting the food was quality Illy coffee.      When I stopped into Coo Coo's for breakfast, I left the fast-paced surface streets of Henderson to step back in time. It reminds me of a diner off US 66. The US 66 diner theme fits in with the Historic Water Street (downtown Henderson) District that is along the Boulder Highway corridor between the Freemont Street Experience and Hoover Dam. I could picture a Hoover Dam worker driving his Model T from Fremont Street on the way to working at the Hoover Dam site. In 2015, Coo Coo's Cafe with a walk along historic Water Street is a nice breakfast choice before the Clark County Museum or Lake Mead. Just pass over this suggestion on Sundays because Coo Coo's is closed.     The Water Street Historic District is more than the home of downtown Henderson. It is also the home of a small cafe serving first-rate scrambled eggs. This is my 4 star scramble endorsement of Coo Coo's cafe."}
{"text":"Coo Coo's was an unexpected find that came about when I was hungry, short on time as I had a job interview to get to, and I didn't want heavy food. I took a chance on them, and have been pleasantly surprised as I've been back a couple times now. But I've waited to write this review as I'm still not sure what to think about this place.   Service: The man behind the counter is the owner. And at first glance he can come across as...aloof, maybe a little intense. But once you get to talk to him he's not a bad guy. And after ordering if you sit close to the front and listen to him interact with the staff they seem to have a camaraderie in there that many places don't.   Food: It's a cafe so it's really all about the food. And while I like the food, there's just something that's not quite perfect. I ordered a California yesterday: Fresh Avocado, Turkey, Smoked Bacon,Swiss, Sprouts, Tomato & Mayo. I chose the fruit cup and a drink which I'll get to in a second. The fruit was fresh cut, and good. But the sandwich was kinda ho-hum. The ingredients were good, but it just seemed to be missing something. And I felt the same way on my first visit with the food I ordered then. 2 visits, same impression, but I can't quite pin it down to tell everyone more than this.   Drinks: Fountain Drinks are strong and good. But I've fallen for their coffee drinks. They use Illy coffee, so an Iced Mocha here is pretty good, and the price beats the socks off of Starbucks.   Decor: This place is small. 6 tables at best. But along one wall they have games, and other things that would encourage someone outside of rush times to stay and linger a bit.   Overall, I've been unsure of how to rate this place and the more I think about it...the more I just don't know. I honestly want to like it, to do my part to support small business and Water St / downtown Henderson places and yet I just can't write this and tell all of you to go jump on Coo Coo's bandwagon.   Regretfully, 3 Stars. I'm not happy with this review but until I can figure it out, it's the best I can offer. The Black Cow Deli in Denver has a California wrap that seems to taste better, and that's the bar I'm measuring Coo Coo's with or so it seems."}
{"text":"The name says it all folks - you'd have to be \"coo-coo\" to eat at this hole in the wall diner. The service was dismal - the ladies behind the counter could barely muster up a smile and a perfunctory greeting between the two of them. The food (breakfast) was just not right. The eggs were rubbery, the bacon definitely NOT applewood-smoked as stated on their website's menu, the croissants were sad & stale, and the butter was actually margarine with a cloying taste. We all agreed that everything just tasted \"strange\". I love diners, especially mom-and-pop establishments, but there are bound to be hit and misses. This was definitely a miss."}
{"text":"Very good place, will definitly be back. Had a sandwich and breakfast.  The place was clean and fast ans the girls behind the counter we very friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in the valley! A co-worker introduced us to it several years ago and we are there on a weekly basis now! I haven't had a bad meal yet, with my favorites being the Señor Pablo salad (try it as a wrap too), the mesquite chicken and bacon sandwich, and the quesadilla. Everything is always super fresh! Delivery is fast and everyone is very pleasant. We even use them for catering now and people just rave about it!"}
{"text":"Great place that has earned my loyalty after 5 or 6 visits. I usually get the crossiant sandwich but today I got the blondie sub and it is amazing. The staff are so friendly and the owner really cares about his customers and the quality of what they serve. I just moved to Vegas from a small town and I love that this is a small local business."}
{"text":"My first experience was a pleasure! Very kind staff and area was clean. California to go! And of course a Monkey..it's everything they say."}
{"text":"We found this hole in the wall spot and we were really excited. This place is tiny inside. You go to the counter, order and they bring the food to your table. They only have basic breakfast food and sandwiches. So if you're looking for burgers and fries, this isn't the place for you. The guy behind the counter was an older gentleman and not particularly friendly.   So we got our food and ate. I will say, for what we got, it wasn't worth the $20 we spent. Rather overpriced in my opinion. The guy kept staring at us, no smile, nothing. Though the food was good, it's nothing I would return to Henderson for. The breakfast sandwich I ate was the same as a Jack n the Box breakfast sandwich. Milkshake was really good but I know we won't be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I happened to be in the area because we pulled off the highway to get gas, and we used Yelp (as we usually do) to find somewhere close to eat that wasn't McDonald's, jack in the box, etc. We came here and we're delightfully surprised!   Don't be fooled by the exterior or neighborhood, Coo Coo's has good food delivered lightning-fast, and their blended coffees actually taste like coffee (versus the sickening sweet concoctions you can get at Starbucks.)  Best scrambled eggs and Belgian waffles I've ever had, and the fruit cups have freshly sliced fruit instead of canned, syrupy \"fruit.\"   The interior is a neat little 50's/60's diner feel...it's a great place for breakfast and coffee!"}
{"text":"Smoothies are super good. Had lunch here once and the sandwich was yummy. You must buy the peanut butter chocolate muffins. So delicious!"}
{"text":"This is one of those obscure places in Downtown Henderson you wouldn't even knew existed unless you heard otherwise, or drove right past. After having driven past this place for years, I finally decided to go on in and give the place a whirl.  I have to say, I have mixed feelings about the place. I had to try one of their malts, being that I'm a slave to the world of ice cream. The malt itself was to die for, but for a large malt it cost nearly $6! Normally I'd consider this outrageous, but considering it was so good I can't really complain. Anyone who has seen Pulp Fiction and recalls that \"Five Dollar Milkshake\" argument between John Travolta and Uma Thurman's characters - the products here bring that argument to life - overpriced, but so damn good you can't resist.  In addition to dessert-style treats, there are a variety of more traditional food items. I haven't really had a chance to explore these too in-depth yet, but what little I have tried has been very good.  If I have one major complaint about the place (other than the prices), it's the fact that this is, apparently, a one-man operation. The owner is friendly, but sometimes one person just isn't enough. When I came in last time he was busy making an item for the person that was there ahead of me, and said he would \"be right with me.\" I stood there for FIVE MINUTES, with no one in front of me in line (besides the person he was making the items for) before I got waited on. I'm serious. PLEASE hire at least one more person. It would make a world of difference.  If you're in the neighborhood, stop into this place and be pleasantly surprised, just keep your expectations in check. The consumables available here are to die for.... just be prepared to wait a while and pay a little more than you might at other places."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place so many times and have always wanted to check it out. I was thrilled when my friend Becki wanted to meet there for lunch.   Coo Coo's is a super tiny and quaint cafe. They only have one large table and several small booths. They also have a couple of outdoor tables, but they were kinda in the gravel. I get it though, there isn't much space outside.   Their menu consists of tons of sandwiches, wraps, paninis, salads, and they serve breakfast all day. They also have lots of coffee drinks, milk shakes and even boba tea! Joel and I decided to share a Tuna Salad Panini on whole wheat bread with a side of chips and I got a regular ice tea. When our food came out our panini looked really good. It has loaded with Tuna Salad and had cheddar cheese oozing out of the sides of the bread. They also give you a chocolate chip cookie with your lunch. I had high hopes for the panini, but they were quickly dashed after I took my first bite. Ick! They put sweet relish in the Tuna Salad. I seriously hate sweet relish, but if you like it you'll love this panini. The cookie was tasty and the chips were just a little bag of Lays. Totally a great deal for just about $8.  If it hadn't been for the sweet relish the panini would have rocked. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other yummy sounding items on their menu. Coo coo's is for sure a hidden gem in the middle of downtown Henderson."}
{"text":"Their delivery service is one of the fastest I have seen!!!  Not to mention the delivery girls are all very nice :)  The croissant breakfast sandwich is my favorite so far!   YUM!"}
{"text":"The Senior Pueblo Salad is amazingly tasty!! Its always my go to when I order Coo Coos..and has never disappointed me. Thanks for the yummy food!!"}
{"text":"Cute place.  I didn't expect it to be as good as it is, but the food is actually better than most other deli/cafe-type places around."}
{"text":"The food was tasty, nothing fancy but that is why the price was excellent! The atmosphere is throwback 60's style and due to counter ordering it was efficient and quick!"}
{"text":"Outside looking in from the street a little deceptive but once you walk in you'll find a cute, cozy, clean restaurant with friendly staff. Serves Fresh gourmet coffee,breakfast, and fresh sandwiches.   Croissant sandwich and hearty breakfast both delicious."}
{"text":"Completely deceptive rating. Those 5 stars come from people that must be easily impressed by anything they find outside of their own kitchen.   This place has two main things that battle each other. One is that it is a clean, eclectic niche type of spot. Very hole-gem type of find.   The second is that the food is cafeteria quality at best. ALL scrambled eggs which tells me it's poured from a carton. \"Gourmet\" coffee is the last thing you'll find.   Also it's not friendly to vegetarian/vegan whatsoever. The hash browns are frozen patties and everything is terribly unseasoned.   I've been to so many dive restaurants across the southwest and midwest and id have to say this is one of the larger disappointments I've found.   If this is the standard in Henderson, then I feel slightly embarrassed to be a long time local and have graduated from the area. Sad because the location is great and the need for good comfort style cafes is huge. It appears the southwest has lost a tradition."}
{"text":"Paul and his staff are amazing! The food is never disappointing. The delivery service to Water St. businesses is so convenient! Coo Coo's is delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Quaint, vintage, and value all in one! This adorable little cafe is tucked away and inconspicuous so you need to look for it! It has all the flavored syrups you can imagine (sugar-free, too!) My iced latte ( almond & vanilla ) was huge! Great value & highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I just love this little sandwich shop located next door to a cute used bookstore.  The menu has breakfast and lunch items as well as italian sodas, smoothies and Boco drinks.  I had the California which I had in a wrap that included turkey, avacado, sprouts, bacon and mayo with fruit and a cookie.  It was very, very yummy!  The owner is very nice.  They also deliver locally and you can either call your order in or fax it in to be delivered."}
{"text":"What a find! I live nowhere near this side of town, but I go to school at NSC and after class was looking for a local coffee shop to get some coffee and a bite to eat. Through Google maps I was lead here and I couldn't be happier! I had the blended dirty chi latte and the California turkey wrap with fresh fruit. I was impressed with the quality and abundance of fresh ingredients. The wrap was stuffed with tons of turkey and fresh avacado, you don't even get that kind of freshness and quality from Subway. The dirty chi was great as well! If you are on this side of town stop in and get something, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"This place has a real cool atmosphere. Little 50/60's inspired café with pictures of James dean and Audrey Hepburn on the walls. Super cute place.   We order a Belgian waffle breakfast plate for $7.49. It came with scrambled eggs and choice of sausage, bacon or ham. We asked for sausage and eggs without cheese. After about 5 min our order came and it had lots of cheese all over our eggs. We had to ask for another scrambled eggs without cheese.  Also we wanted fruit originally instead of meat because we don't eat meat and the lady said it would be an extra $3. Yikes. Also I asked for a glass of nonfat milk and they were charging around $3 for that as well. So I decided to not add fruit and get a glass of water instead.  Pros: fast delivery, free wifi, cute atmosphere, endless options of blended drinks, espresso drinks, coffee etc.   Cons: a bit expensive, very small place   Would I go back again? Eh probably not"}
{"text":"I've been a customer of Coo Coo's for years--literally.  I started working in Henderson in 1997 (I'm old) and ever since then, Paul and his crew have been serving up good food and great service.  Most of the City employees eat at Coo Coo's or have food delivered, from lattes to Funky Monkeys to bagels and sandwiches.  The restaurant is on the small side, but there's outside seating and I know when it's too busy to eat there.  I usually show up around 11:30am if I'm going to dine-in and order online first so Paul knows we're coming.  He'll reserve a booth for us so we have somewhere to sit.  My regular order is the Ocean Spray sandwich (turkey w/ cranberry dressing) or the Veggie Delight sandwich (alfalfa sprouts, cream cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers).  Coo Coo's also started serving boba drinks a few years back and I get my fix almost every other week.   Coo Coo's is a downtown Henderson institution and I appreciate all the years of food and friendly service Paul and his staff have served up.  We've gotten to know each other over all these years and I'm sure I'm not the only one--it's like Cheers without the alcohol.  Thanks for all you do, Coo Coo's--let's stay together."}
{"text":"Heard this place was good by the Lovelady brewing co. but we thought otherwise. First off the guy that somewhat greeted us, did not seem very pleasant or happy  to be there. He just said \"Order here at the counter when your ready\". And when we did he still had no friendliness to his attitude whatsoever.   We got breakfast. I got the sunrise sandwich with bacon on sourdough. Very bland, nothing special I must say. My husband had the hearty breakfast with the bacon. The bacon looked like a dry mess. I make much better at home. He said the whole thing was horrible, including the scrambled eggs. The hash browns looked like some frozen patties they threw on the grill. So needless to say, we will not come here again."}
{"text":"The california is the best sandwich in vegas, turkey, avacado,sprouts, bacon and mayo on a french roll with chips and a cookie!? its a good day when i can have this sandwich."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch for the first time today. I had the California on a French roll. The food was great. My sandwich had turkey, bacon, fresh avocado, sprouts and mayo. The portions are large. Fast and friendly service. I will be eating here again soon!"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite small-town-feel places to eat. Their California sandwich is to die for!! They are a super awesome joint and I highly recommend to try it out if you're around Water street in Henderson!!"}
{"text":"Drove by this place one day and it caught my eye, so about a week later I decided to drop in for breakfast. This is a tiny little place, maybe 8 tables. They have gourmet coffee, smoothies, and a nice menu.   I went for the Hearty breakfast (6.99) which had 3 scrambled eggs covered in cheese and 6....yes 6!! strips of applewood smoked bacon...along with toast and a fruit cup. Pretty good deal! I added a strawberry kiwi smoothie (4 and change) for 20 oz cup.   Overall, nice little spot with good food, family owned. I'll come back and try a few more items, and maybe get a cup of gourmet coffee. Since its so small, I saw a number of take out orders being prepped and served."}
{"text":"Great service but food was like from a camping trip - powdered eggs, microwaved sausage patty, and Eggo waffles - no lie!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to find a place to get a coconut italian soda less than a mile from my house. I was blown away when I found out how big the large was and that it was under $3. This place is fantastic. Also check out their menu-- full of smoothies, espresso drinks, and sandwiches. Water Street needed an independent coffee shop like this."}
{"text":"I love this little place nestled in next to a used book store on Pacific ave in downtown henderson.  They server breakfast and lunch.  Not really a place to sit around and have a meal but a great pick-up place with good offerings.  Their Funky Monkey Frappe is too good for words.  For breakfast, I truly enjoy their bagel sandwiches.  And best yet, when I'm in the mood, they'll make me a PBJ.  Now that's a local place!"}
