{"text":"The food is excellent and prices are good.  The owners are friendly and they always welcome you with a smile!  
The Place is spotless, I went to the restroom to wash my hands and I was amazed how clean it was.

My son and I, when were on Deer valley we always go there for lunch...

The service is very good. We never have to wait long to get our food.

I give them a 5-Star rating, because I like everything about this place.

Give it a try, you will not be disappointed and the food is GREAT!

{"text":"Always good quality food and customer service..Always clean..! Im a raving fan...and i eat free when i fill up my punch card..!"}
{"text":"What a friendly bunch at this great little place!!! I hadn't written a review yet and I've been her about 7 times. Simply put, food is delicious, fresh and quality ingredients including the fresh brewed tea. 

The owner takes such pride and the place is so clean! The prior business was a joke compared to JJ's. This new restaurant is  just spotless. Clean bathrooms and i swear you could eat the yummy food off the floor lol. I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Had the gyro plate for lunch and it was hot,fresh and tasty. Service was fast and accurate. A healthy meal in under 10 minutes for under $10! I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to go to. The food AND service is consistently good, generous and genuinely kind.  I go there for the food and always return because of the service. I never have to worry about whether they are having a \"good\" day or a \"bad\" one. The food is always good, and more importantly, so are the people. :)"}
{"text":"Five star fresh,clean great service very friendly stuff. They have new owner now they way better than the old one"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this place!! I just wish they would open a second location in Peoria so I could eat their food ever day! Jim and Julie are fantastic hosts. The food is absolutely delicious and is matched only by the service. BTW, the bathroom is spotless which to me is an indicator as to the pride that the owners have in their place. J (Julie) and J (Jim) YOU and your GYROS  ARE A-NUMBER ONE!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding greek and middle eastern dishes. Excellent service and friendly atmosphere. The owner is always at the restaurant and her perserverence for perfection is obvious in both product and service. I highly recommend this family owned restaurant with AAA cleanliness ratings."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. Great gyro's and fries, I've never had a bad experience here. The staff is always friendly. There's great consistency with the food quality and service. Plus, if you get there 30 min before closing, you can watch Impractical Jokers with Jim haha."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by our entire experience. I had the chicken salad and my friend had the chicken pita, the chicken was extremely flavorful, salad was fresh and pitas were too. The staff was extremely friendly and we loved how clean the place was, even smelled fresh. You can tell the new owners truly care about their customers, what a difference they've made. We'll be back, can't wait to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I come here 2 times a week at least,  these guys are 100% consistent, all food is very fresh and always tastes amazing not only that but they get it out soooo fast and have very friendly customer service"}
{"text":"I love J J's Gyros! Their food is amazing! I'm Addicted! They have great customer service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"1st impression when i walked in i instantly was amazed by the cleanliness and the food is made from the heart using the highest quality ingredients and highest attention and level of care for handling the food. food looks exactly as it looks and packs love and a fresh taste. i told the owner cleanliness is next to godliness! this is a place worth visiting and eating. staff is outstanding i felt like i was at moms home thank you for reading."}
{"text":"Just got done eating lunch here. There was absolutely nothing to complain about with this place. We walked in an we're greeted immediately the restaurant was clean and there was a good amount of seating. There was a nice selection of menu items but we all wanted to try the gyro pitas. I ordered a gyro pita with a side salad. The food came out fairly quickly and they gave a good amount of meat and a nice little salad. The food was hot and all of it had great flavor there wasn't a single element that I would have changed. We all walked out saying that we'd definitely be back (something rare for us all to say)."}
{"text":"The new owner is great, very hard working, and wants to make sure customers are happy. the food is good. I love supporting a family owned business."}
{"text":"Super nice. Fast service. Good food. Will be going back. This is a good work/lunchtime option for sure."}
{"text":"Being middle eastern, I'm a very tough critic when it comes to Mediterranean food. I tried this place out and I very much enjoyed every bite. Great quality food, super friendly staff, and the owner is the sweetest lady I ever met. Her name is Julie and you can tell she strives to make sure every customer entering the restaurant is going home very pleased. I will continue to let people know about JJ's. I wish Yelp gave a 10 Star option...."}
{"text":"Pretty good came here in the middle of the day, got the gyro plate. The only reason for four stars is that it looked completely different than the picture and my gyro plate was missing hummus."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices.  Not exactly a destination restaurant for your out of town friends, but it's a staple on my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I am having a hard time not going in several times a day their food is so good.  I have not made my way through every combination on the menu yet and it is very hard not making a few favorites along the way.  They do have a busy lunch hour with Honeywell and Cox local, but they are efficient and well worth the wait.  Indoor seating, patio tables, and take out."}
{"text":"The best gyros and chicken kabob pita sandwiches in Phoenix and we've tried many.   Tzatziki sauce is wonderful.   Restaurant and bathrooms are very clean.   Owners are super friendly and make sure you enjoy what you order.  This is our new \"go to\" place for gyros and chicken pitas!!!"}
{"text":"All the other 5 star reviews are spot on. The food is excellent. The customer service is great. The location is clean, and layers out well. I'm typically not a big fan of restaurant fries but the fries are wonderful, and unlike most places they have an assortment of toppings for the fries. My only complaint is they are always so busy! But I can't hold that against the restaurant or the customers! My friends and I stayed a little late one night and the owner or manager was very accommodating, didn't rush us at all, and even set us up with some off the menu goodies. I can not say enough good things about JJ's. OPEN A SECOND LOCATION!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I checked out this place with some co-workers the other day and found the food and service to both be excellent.  Although there is another Greek gyro place that we frequent, we decided to try something different.  I had the Chicken Schwarma and really enjoyed the seasoning and the generous amount of chicken in my sandwich.  The fries were also very good and I could tell that they were just made and hadn't been sitting around for a while.  
I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. I always pass it but this time I said why not?.. And OMG I've been missing out! I've never had Greek nor Mediterranean food. It was simply delightful. Great customer service, clean establishment."}
{"text":"One of the best Greek restaurants in town. Greek food is one of my favorites and I always judge the restaurant by their taziki sauce. Theirs is by far the best. This place is always very clean with fast friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! I love coming here. The food is delicious. It comes out quickly and tastes fresh. The people working here are very friendly as well. It makes coming in here easy and enjoyable. I would recommend this place to anyone!! I frequently eat here and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Very good food! I had the chicken kabob plate. It came with lots of chicken, rice, and side salad. The whole meal was great!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Every time we visit we are greeted with a smile. You can actually taste the pride in the food, no words to describe it. Very clean and family welcoming. The owners Jim and Julie are super dedicated to this establishment by providing everyone outstanding costumer service and food."}
{"text":"Had the Pita Gyro for lunch....fast service, good food, reasonable pricing. 2nd time here ....Had the Lamb Kabob sanwich.....it was great."}
{"text":"Pretty good Greek food for the price. Had the gyro plate with baba ganoush substituted for the pilaf. Everything was good, except the pita which seemed store bought. Has a bit of a hole in the wall feel with styrofoam plates and plastic utensils.  It was a nice, quick place to eat lunch. I would eat there again."}
{"text":"When first opening my gyro, I thought I asked for a plain gyro when I asked for light onion, however, all the toppings were on the bottom. I can appreciate the amount of meat provided, but not nearly enough sauce on the meat. Service was very good and I had less than a 5 min wait for my food."}
{"text":"What a great place! Great food, reasonable prices, fast and friendly service. I think the place is locally owned and operated too."}
{"text":"You want great food? Come here. You want happy service? This is the place. I mean, not only was someone cleaning while I entered, but every single staff member was smiling and happy to see me, even the cook in the back! I ordered some to-go food for the fam, left for ten minutes, returned to pick up the food, and was greeted outside the restaurant by the cook who handed me the bagged food...he saw me park and thought he may as well bring the food to my car. I mean, c'mon...this is the best place ever."}
{"text":"Brand new owner! The staff is friendly and the food exceptional. They go out of their way to make you feel a valued guest, not \"customer,\" GUEST.  Very friendly and pleasant. They let me try their new Kifta Kabob and it was delicious! Will definitely return and bring others!"}
{"text":"By far a gem in the desert! Great food, great service, and by far the cleanest restaurant I've ever been too. Don't pass this place up, it truly is a gem!"}
{"text":"Everything has always been fresh and delicious. I have had a ton of different gyros in my life, and this one ranks up there in the top five easily. Incredible flavor fresh vegetables you can't beat it."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch , tender meat,fresh veggies. Friendly staff ! We are differently going to come back."}
{"text":"This place is great. Their gyros I find are amazing- I'm super picky so this was a win for me especially being not too far from my house. It's family owned, and they are extremely friendly and take pride in their food. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great little Mediterranean styled place for lunch. Wonderful and fresh lamb and chicken!"}
{"text":"Really good gyros. Great service. It's good to see new places come up with great options. 
We will back many more times"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Very clean and the food is great. I had the steak Shawarma, I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"First time and most definitely coming back, came for a gyro and ended up getting it with a skewer of lamb and it tastes homemade! Meat was juicy and not over cooked. Veggies were fresh and the service was comforting too. I feel satisfied and the price is low compared to other places that aren't nearly as good!"}
{"text":"So I rarely give 5 stars, but this place deserves it. I got the hummus deluxe with Chicken, the chicken was seasoned wonderfully and cooked to perfection. The Tabouleh was the freshest I have ever had (I have had Greek across the country). And the Hummus was to die for, perfectly blended, fresh and the best I have ever had- though I ordered a side of Tzatziki Sauce which was forgotten, still this place deserves my 5 stars by far! love this place and we be back many times to come!"}
{"text":"Literally the chicken shawarma blew my mind! This place is awesome! They are so kind and friendly I felt at home and the food is a must try!!! Thanks JJs for making my day turn around!!!"}
{"text":"The place is about 10,000 times cleaner than it was before the service was great and very very fast.

I had the obligatory gyro with everything and fries.
 The gyro was excellent, exactly as they should be. The fries are good they just have some sort of coating on them to make them crispy or l something I just don't care for, my personal preference. 

The menu is extensive and reasonably priced and they actually have lamb available."}
{"text":"I have been stopping in to JJ's for a couple years now during my lunch breaks and have never once left disappointed. The atmosphere is very calming. I don't think I have ever even seen a scrap of trash of dirt anywhere. The entire staff always has a smile and are very polite. Now to the food. I am very picky when it comes to Gyros and they hands down have the best in Arizona. Nobody else even comes close to the flavor of the lamb and the balance of the sauce. Anything I have tried on the menu has always come out fresh and flavorful. I wish more restaurants could focus on the quality of the food and service just as much as JJ's. Keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"This place is near my work so I've been there frequently for lunch..food has always been delicious and fresh. Staff is super nice and the place is very open and bright. 

I mainly get the JJ's combo with the Kifta and Chicken kabob...comes with a Greek salad and portions are big. 

Always my go to spot when I'm craving Greek food."}
{"text":"This was such a great find! We happened to see the sign for this place after batting practice and we're so glad we stopped. It caught our eye because we call our daughter JJ. The owners are so incredibly kind and customer service orientated. We had gyros and salads. The gyro meat is sliced thin and is so good and the pitas are perfect. We've been here twice and the second time going in was just as good as the first. The owner remembered my daughter and was asking her about softball and her favorite players. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First Time here. Got the Chicken Kabob Plate $9. Not bad it comes with Chicken, yellow rice which is delicious, a side salad and pita bread. The chicken has a lot of seasoning so there's a lot of flavor going on there. WIth a drink it came to about $11. Not bad for real food compared to fast food which is about the same price. I ordered my food to go and the guy actually came over and handed the food to me. Nice hole in the wall Greek/Mediterranean place for Lunch if you work in the area. And yes they have stamp cards for those who frequent. Next time I'll try their Chicken Shawarma!"}
{"text":"Delicious gyros! They do not skimp you on the quantity but the veggies could use some freshness. My favorite part was their kind service. I do wish that they would offer a price for just the gyros because I don't like frys or need a lettuce and tomato salad. I like options, and they didn't really provide any."}
{"text":"Really good pitas salads gyro and shawarma.  Clean and comfortable.  Spices are just right!"}
{"text":"Gotta try that steak schwarma...you'll be glad you did! Second time here; both times JJs hit home runs with the food. Bookmarked!"}
{"text":"It's been my favorite restaurant in phoenix every time we come over from SanDiego our first stop there food always fresh and employees very friendly i recommend to every one try there Gyros its very good and the Veggies always fresh very good place"}
{"text":"I eat here on my lunch break often and have been extremely happy every time. The place is always busy at lunch, but they get food out quickly still. All the people who work here are very friendly and helpful. The place is super clean. Everything that I have tried has been delicious and for a great price. The chicken shwarma pita with fries and a fresh brewed iced tea is my top choice. So good! This is by far my favorite go to Greek restaurant. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had the hummus with gyro meat. I wasn't all that hungry so I didn't expect to eat all that much. I ate nearly the entire thing, it was so delicious! The owner told me how they made it from scratch and everything is homemade. It definitely shows! I will be going back hungry."}
{"text":"I just found this restaurant driving by and it's the most cleanest and Best food in phoenix, I have tried almost every restaurant and have not tasted lamb and kebab like JJ's. The owner's Julie, Jim and the staff are so friendly you feel like home. please try the food here you will love it."}
{"text":"Grabbed a gyro sandwich for lunch and it was okay. For one I was a little disappointed that they put so little gyro on the sandwhich. The meat itself had good taste. Also instead of having buffalo sauce like most gyro places do, they had red hot seasoning. Like a dry rub kind of thing. Wth?
Will I be back? Maybe if I'm in a pinch but not if I have time and options.

I'd suggest they get real buffalo sauce and put a little more meat on their sandwiches"}
{"text":"What a great tasting, quick Greek place to grab a bite. The food is always super fresh tasting and fast service. Can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"Best gyro sandwich on this side of town. The chicken kabob is my favorite. I eat lunch here every couple of weeks and I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"I wanted to grab a bite before work and luckily saw JJs. Its perfect for your gyro fix. The tzaziki was the best and the prices were very fair. As Arnold once said \"I'll be back\""}
{"text":"We landed at airport and were heading to flagstaff. Needed a good spot past the traffic. It was very very quick, big menu, and diversity. It was good, not the best but good. A lot of meat was given!  So much meat. The greek salad had too much italian dressing on it. The french fries were crisp and good. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, excellent portions with really decent prices, the business is new but they set very high standards. I really enjoyed my experience and definitely will be regular customer. I'm originally from Middle East and that restaurant has the closest taste of home. The service is good and so friendly, I will recommend the place for this app users as I recommend to my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Great gyros, shwarma, falafels. 
7.25 being standard price for sandwhich/fry combo. drink is seperate. 

the chicken shwarma is king! add feta ($1) to make it extra killer! The sauce is perfect, delicious and hot, always & always so nice.

Been here about 50 times and never got sick, also never had a problem with my order. And they do frequent customer punch cards. 

coke products. and they have homemade baklava. owner/operated. 
Defiantly worth a try! Great stuff!"}
{"text":"WOW !!!!!!  For a very long time people have been telling me to try a Gyro.  Well  ??  I finally did and it was absolutely amazing !!!  This little shop is fabulous.  My husband & I will be stopping in once a month on our way to our second shift job, for lunch.  We have even been thinking about not doing lunch & calling in for dinner before they close.  Whatever we decide, we are sure that all the menu items will be just as great as my first Gyro.  That sauce was FANTASTIC !!!!!!  And there are so many delicious dishes to try.  Mmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Well it's been 2 years since I reviewed JJ's and to this day I will not change a word of my review. The quality, freshness, flavor and service remain the highest quality and care. You can taste the quality in every bite."}
{"text":"Always consistent and fresh.  I stick with the sampler platter (hummus, baba ganoush, salad, dolmades, falafel and \"cucumbers OR pita\") as I don't do meat. It's a great option!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I get the gyro Plate and my girlfriend gets the chicken plate. Very clean inside, friendly service."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple times and I love it every time. I know the owner personally, Juliet, and she has a great passion for providing a great meal at a great price. She has even given me a tour of the kitchen and I can't believe how clean it is and how much pride of ownership she has in her restaurant. She is a very kind lady and if you ever have any issues, let her know and she will absolutely make it right. Food is absolutely fantastic, especially the Kifta Kabob which happens to be my favorite, however, you really can't go wrong with anything there. Great food at a great price with great ownership, you really can't go wrong. Give it a shot, you will be very happy you did!!"}
{"text":"I feel like giving this place 3 stars is pretty fair. I'm always on the lookout for a good gyro and delicious hummus. I don't want you to think this place is bad, because it's not. It was all tasty! The prices are decent too and the portions are huge.

However, I didn't expect the hummus to taste like grocery store hummus. The gyro meat was pretty good too and obviously was shaved off a rotisserie which is the only way to do it! But it had a strange crispiness and seemed overdone. I'm not privy to seeing behind the scenes, but if I made a guess... The meat seemed pre-shaven and then haphazardly reheated. It seems like a busy place so I get wanting to save time, but people are paying for this. I was also disappointed with the pita bread as well. I expected something fresher than I can find in a bag at Walmart.

Anyways, I would probably go again if I had a gyro craving and nowhere else was open. Especially since their tzatziki sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped in one afternoon for a Gyro and saw that they had Italian Beef sandwiches. I was hesitant to try it as I was thinking how good can an Italian Beef be in a Greek Sandwich shop! Well let me tell you that it is delicious! I am from Chicago, home of the Italian Beef Sandwich and it took me right back there! Very delicious! It is served with an order of fries and it's really a great value. 
In addition to that the Gyros are excellent too!
But I have to say that the service is amazing. The Owners are very friendly and make you feel like you have known them all your life!
You must try the food here. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's close to work so I frequent this establishment a couple times a month. Customer service is always way above average. The food is great, I usually get a Greek salad minus the feta and pita. The chicken is super tasty. I've never had the gyro meat here as most gyro meat is not gluten free so I can't speak for it but a friend from work says it's very good.
The hummus is also really tasty. I've never had to wait long for lunch here, even when they're busy."}
{"text":"This place was excellent! I highly recommend. You get a lot of food for the money and it was delicious. The customer service is top notch. We showed up 5 minutes before 11 and they opened early for those that were waiting outside. Once inside I immediately noticed how clean the place was. Even the bathroom was spotless. It only took us less than  10 minutes to receive our food. I couldn't believe how busy it got as we were getting ready to leave. If your in the area you should definitely stop. You won't regret it one bit!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the owners are excellent with my kids. 
4 and 6 years old. 
Never a complaint about us walking in 5 min to close and placing an order to go. 
These are some nice hardworking folks and I will always come back. They actually appreciate your patronage and are always happy to answer questions. Or modify something to your liking."}
{"text":"I have not found a good gyros in AZ since I moved several years ago. This place is very yummy! The gyros, humus, salad and rice were very good. We will for sure return. The service was quick, everything tastes fresh, inside it was clean and the people there were friendly. Next time I'll ask for extra gyros sauce and peta bread, but that's a personally preference."}
{"text":"Great gyro and fries! Everything cooked perfectly. Wishing for more veggies and a little less sauce. But other than that a great experience. Very clean restaurant and restroom. Extremely friendly service and smiles everywhere. I would return!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, but the guy that's always at the counter when we go is always so gracious. It's amazing to go places where people enjoy what they're doing. It says a lot about how the food is prepared, and how the business is run. Great food, and service with a smile."}
{"text":"I loved the falafel plate! Everything was fresh & flavorful. The pita bread was divine!  The price was very reasonable. The staff was friendly, helpful, knowledgeable. The restroom was probably the cleanest I have ever seen in any restaurant! Definitely will go to this great restaurant again!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because the owner was very nice and has done a lot to turn the place around. It is clean and has nice atmosphere. 

The food was just not very good. It may just come down to personal preference but I did not care for the flavor at all.

I hope enough others enjoy the flavor and this place can stay in business"}
{"text":"My favorite go to lunch.  The owner Julie is incredible. She cares about her customers.  She makes sure the food is fresh and fast and healthy.  Their large Greek salad with chicken is the best. She marinates the chicken in a little bit of heaven.  The lettuce and vegetables are chopped fresh every day. Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazingly nice folks. Huge portions. Reasonable prices. 

And the food, the fooood....woW, the food here is excellent! You must try it. check out the pictures"}
{"text":"Great service at this place! The staff is really friendly and they bring your food to your table (which is a nice bonus). The food was pretty tasty as well. I got the chicken swarma sandwich with the salad (you can get fries, but I'm trying to lose weight). The sandwich/wrap wasn't the best, but it was definitely above average. I hate salad but the cheese (I think it was cottage) was a nice way the balance the salad. They also have a lot of hot sauce choices including Sriracha and Frank's Red Hot (which I used because it's been a staple of mine lately). The place was real clean and the food came out in less than 5 minutes.

Overall:
Service - 5
Food - 4
Wait time - 5
Cleanliness - 5"}
{"text":"Been going here for quite a while since current owners took over. The people are all so friendly and customer service focused.  The previous owners were not so much.

The food is very good, comes out quickly.  

I've been trying to eat healthier here so I get the salad with chicken kebab.  So delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing food, first time here. I walked in thinking I would see an empty \"strip mall\" kind of restaurant. There were 20 + people eating.. I got the Gyro plate.. some of the best food I have had.. hands down.. I'll be back.  Good prices too."}
