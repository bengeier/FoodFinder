{"text":"Decided to try this place after seeing a review on BlogTO. Went on a Sunday morning, the place is extremely small but there was 2 tables available. I ordered a cappuccino while my friend and I looked at the menu. The menu is quite small. There was not a single thing on the menu that my friend and I liked. We are not typically picky eaters. I enjoy omelettes and she enjoys eggs with bacon. This place only serves peameal bacon. I considered getting the French toast but it has bananas all over it and I strongly dislike bananas. So we decided that I would drink the cappuccino and we would leave! They definitely need to add some basic items to their menu. Not everyone enjoys the \"foodie\" type food! There is one cook and one server so service is quite slow. I wouldn't say don't go, but look up the menu before you go to make sure you like something on it!"}
{"text":"I'm Irish so always on the lookout for an authentic fry-up. This is now my go-to for their Full English. It's a cosy place that can be busy, with a bit of a farmhouse feel. Excellent fry with both puddings and beans. Coffee here is great too and staff are very friendly. They also sell a lot of the food frozen (sausages/pudding, etc). They rotate the menu fairly regularly and looks really good, but the fry is so good I can't get away from it yet! 

Got to mention the Sunday evening roast that they do once a month or so. The best Yorkshire pudding that you will find in the city. Get on the email dist. list for when they're doing it."}
{"text":"Um...yum! We were headed for Huevos Gourmet to give it a second try but it was kinda busy. I always have one or two places in reserve, just in case, and had already noted this place. 

What a pleasant find! Cozy, clean and very British. Partly general store but mostly a simple and very well done cafe-style brunch place. 

Incredible French toast with strawberry cream cheese elderberry sauce. Delicious! The half English breakfast was perfect. Two eggs, breakfast sausages, grilled tomato, toast and some of the best fries (chips) I've had. Good coffee and tasty apple juice.

Excellent prices and we even left with 4 frozen chicken tikka masala pies to eat at home. 

This great find is tucked off the beaten path and I'm so glad we didn't blindly line up at the more prominent Huevos. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We've been to Kitchen on Sixth a bunch of times. It's a great British breakfast/brunch spot that we were happy to welcome to our community when it opened.

They also offer a selection of British grocery items and frozen pies, sausages etc. to take away, the occasional pop-up style Sunday Roast (get on the email list/follow their pages), they participated in La Poutine Week a little while ago w/ a delicious looking British spin on poutine & were listed as one of the top new brunch spots in Toronto by BlogTO early this year.

It is a shame it's tucked away, as it doesn't get the same kind of exposure as the grand Blvd, but it's steps away from Lake Shore & is not to be missed. A real gem.

The atmosphere is very warm & cozy. The owner is always welcoming, happy to have a chat when she is free and is very keen to engage in the community.

The meals are great (even for 3 out of 4 of us who are vegetarian) and they are always happy to discuss/accommodate special needs/requests. We hear that they are expanding the menu to dinner options which will include other vegetarian meals and if that's the case, they'll definitely be seeing more of us.

We're looking forward to the patio season and that's where you'll find us when it's open!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, very poor service.  Long wait for food and no heat on a cold winter day didn't make for a great first experience.  The food was very tasty but when mixed with the other factors we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Living in the neighbourhood I was very pleased to come across Kitchen on Sixth, and even happier to find it has a patio for enjoying the summer weather. The owner was very nice and friendly. My partner and I both had the Classic Benny which was delicious! An added little touch, the whole grain mustard on the English muffin was great! Classic British tunes added to the enjoyment. Definitely will be back to try the full English breakfast, including black and white pudding!"}
{"text":"Being from Qu√©bec, I know my poutine very well. Surprisingly, this British type restaurant has the BEST poutine in the city, with handcut fries, homemade beef ale gravy (so rich) and fresh cheese curds that actually melt unlike the curds that retain their shape and are rubbery. Great presentation of the food, laid back atmosphere, extremely friendly chef/owner (?) and good menu. My second time here and without a doubt the best brunch in the area."}
{"text":"Me and a group of friends wanted to try a new brunch place for a change. We came here at around noon. The place was fully booked but we were willing to wait. Fast forward to the food. I was looking forward to ordering the Classic Benedict however they ran out of Hollandaise sauce which is why i gave them 4 stars. That was a little bit disappointing. Instead I got the Mushrooms on toast which was delicious. The red wine and garlic was a nice flavour combination and and fries were so good I kept eating them of my friends plates! Overall, we were all very happy with this place and would come back. Keeping my fingers crossed they have Hollandaise sauce next time!"}
{"text":"Amazing English brunch. Looking forward to returning for Sunday roast. 
Have the typical English items you want to buy: Yorkshire tea, Branston's pickle. 
Really cozy and cute. Nice patio."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm around the area I always end up in Kitchen on Sixth for its great value food, delicious meals, and incredible hospitality.  Atmosphere is very warm and friendly and those who have an attention to detail would notice the decor changes to match the seasons or events.  Jenny (the owner) always makes me feel at home whenever I'm here, and the portions really make coming here worthwhile, empty stomach or half tank - it feels like there's a dish for every craving.  I usually get the half-English meal which was great - have yet to try the benedicts but I saw another customer order it and it looked fabulous.  Great recommend!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this little gem for Sunday brunch while driving in the area. 

Adorable little place with a cute patio out front. Not a whole lot of tables but we were lucky enough to be seated right away. 

There was only one extremely pleasant server working all of the tables so it took a little longer than I would like before we were brought our coffee. Understandable and totally worth the wait. The coffee is amazing. 

The menu is small which made for uncomplicated ordering. I ordered the breakfast poutine and the Mr ordered the 1/2 English breakfast. Considering how busy it was, with only one very busy cook, I was pleased and surprised that our food came out so quick. 

We were both quite happy with what we ordered. The fries were home cut, my sunny side up egg was perfection and the gravy was extremely tasty. 

Our only complaint and reason for the missing star was that both of our orders weren't as hot as we would have liked and the long wait for our coffee. 

Would recommend this place for nice relaxing Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Kitchen On Sixth is an absolute gem. Terrific spot for Sunday brunch. Their breakfast poutine was absolutely life-changing!! Plus the sausage and peameal were incredible! Perfect spot if you're looking for a bite with an authentically English touch. Bonus, the owners are incredibly nice!"}
{"text":"A delicious brunch spot in the west end that I'd wholeheartedly recommend, particularly for ambiance, but with a very important caveat: it might not be a good idea to visit during peak meal times. We had a great first visit here and a very solid brunch experience, but note that I'd attribute such a great experience not just to the decent food, very charming ambiance, and clean and well-decorated spot, but also to the fact that we arrived at 9:00 AM on a Saturday morning and were the only customers in the entire restaurant throughout our whole meal, meaning we didn't have to deal with the slow service that many people commented on below.

First, the parking situation. There's some parking along Lakeshore Road, but there's also a Green P right across the street from the restaurant where parking is $1.50 per hour.

Second, the food. We weren't too hungry and came by just for a quick bite. We ordered: a) coffee and tea ($2.00 each), b) a yogurt parfait with granola and strawberries ($5.00), and c) a Double Decker Peameal Stack ($11.00) full of peameal bacon, cheese, various toppings and 3 English muffins - it also came with home fries. Overall, the food was pretty good! Crispy, well-seasoned fries, great flavours in the sandwich. A very satisfying morning meal.

As others noted, there was just 1 server running the whole place. For our orders alone, without any other customer in the restaurant, it took about 12 minutes for our food to come out (fresh, great quality, and piping hot). Not bad for my own personal visit, but I can see how it can be potentially frustrating if, a) there were multiple tables to be served, with b) just the 1 server/owner running the restaurant + patio out front. It isn't a big spot, with just a handful of tables, but I can see how service could easily become slower at peak meal times.

Overall, this is a great brunch spot to a point (i.e. depending what time of day you visit) and we really enjoyed our visit here. It has a very relaxed, casual, super charming atmosphere (bright red chairs! bright red (fake) daisies! What's not to love?!). If they can work out the kinks re: service and efficiency, this could be a very reliable brunch spot in the area. But for now, come early (or later in the afternoon) if you decide to visit.

For two people, with tax and tip, we paid around $26.00."}
{"text":"Quaint little place off of lakeshore, nice atmosphere. 

Very friendly and fast service! Much better than any bunch place downtown. 

Ordered the breakfast poutine and a specialty strawberry drink that was quite refreshing!

A breakfast poutine sounds like a gimmick but this place mastered it. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"First time here. 

Cute little place on Lakeshore Blvd in Mimico. It has a Boho vibe and the music was definitely 60s inspired. 

Was greeted with a friendly smile when I arrived and seated promptly. Menu choices are limited but there's definitely variety from traditional English breakfast to healthier choices as well as pastries. I believe they have dinner service on some evenings as well. 

A star goes to the coffee. It's rare to find good coffee in a place like this but it was fresh and a great roast. 

I ordered the half English breakfast which is eggs and sausage (pea meal bacon is an option) with toast, baked tomato and home fries. I asked for the eggs over easy and they were perfectly done and the sausage was tasty. The toast was a bit stiff -- I suspect it had been toasted long before I arrived -- I also never said anything so it's on me. The only other tiny thing is the home fries were really just French fries but that's a personal preference -- I'm a hash browns guy! 

Overall. Cute and welcoming. The two women running the place never stopped moving and they were both kind and courteous. Hard workers! Great Service! That goes a long way for me!! 

Give it a try. I'll be back and that coffee !!"}
{"text":"New Toronto is the home of a dozen brunch restaurants. Competition is pretty high, and the food at kitchen on 6th. 

Food: we were 3 vegetarians, who were filled at the end of the meal. Very tasty food with new and interesting flavors. 

Service : super slow. Owner said that she had just recently fired her server, so she was doing everything. But it took a looooong time to get out meal. Almost 50 mins. Owner seemed that she ran out of groceries halfway through the service... 

Location : it's tucked away in the corner. But easy to find. 

Would I go back? Yes... If they are able to fix service time..."}
{"text":"This is not fast food. It IS a spot for a delicious leisurely brunch.

When Huevos Gormet had a line out the door, we went for a walk looking for an alternative and happened upon Kitchen on Sixth. There was a spot available on the small patio out front under the umbrella and we grabbed it.

The menu is focused on comfort foods. My eye was caught by the triple-decker peameal cheddar mustard on english muffins with a side of fries. My better half had the sides of Peameal, Baked Beans, and Toast with Tea.

The triple-decker was delicious, and I had to eat it in sections it was so big. The fries were perfectly seasoned and piping hot. The Peameal was excellent, the bread was nicely toasted, while the beans were blandly adequate. 

The service was friendly. Only one woman (presuming the owner) was working all the jobs the day we were there. My suggestion would be little pots of coffee/hot water for the tables, if there is no time to check on refills. (My coffee intake was below average this brunch!) 

All in all a pleasant meal, we will be back and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Cute spot with a nice patio seating area. Shared the French toast and portobello mushroom eggs Benny. Both were tasty and would get them again. No lattes but the brew choice was bold and 10x better than any diner."}
{"text":"Lovely little place. Very cozy and rustic. The food is as great as British food could possibly be. Throughly enjoyed the Full English breakfast. The owner, Jenny, is very welcoming. Can't wait for warmer weather and their patio. We will definitely be back for brunch!
A bit tough to find - don't let that discourage you. It's on Sixth st itself; just (a few steps) north of lakeshore, on the west side."}
{"text":"Solid Fry Up and good menu at a decent/average price point. Only problem is what everyone else is mentioning: service is SLOW. I think it's just one lady serving the whole restaurant so unfortunately we waited a good 10-15 minutes before we even got menus and then an additional 30-40 minutes before we saw any food hit the table.

The black and white sausage was really good and authentic. I'd go back just based on the lack of decent breakfast/brunch alternatives in the immediate area."}
{"text":"I am so happy to see this little restaurant grow and secure this great spot. We loved going to their old location however it was a bit small. Now with any expansion there is going to be a learning curve for new staff, but the food is unbelievable and you won't be disappointed. We went and had the breakfast poutine and the French Toast, both were full of flavour, cooked to perfection and reminded me of my grandmothers cooking. 

Now I haven't been able to try out their Sunday Roast Dinner yet, but the owner told me she makes the Yorkshire pudding fresh that day, and toast is cooked to a nice juicy medium. Just the thought of it was makin my mouth water. 

They have their liquor license now and have many offerings every night of the week and we can't wait to return and enjoy that taste of home cooking. It's nice to have a bit of home in the area."}
{"text":"Great little spot.  Another Yelp find!  Cozy, cute and friendly. Great breakfasts, traditional English fare, no frou-frou brunch items.  Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Super great tiny little space. 

The owner is lovely, and the menu is pretty basic/English/delicious. I know people who have also been there a few times for special event dinners they have (roast dinners, for example)... not been veggie friendly yet, but apparently that's in the works. 

For brunch, it's cozy, it's comfy food, and it can get pretty full. Don't worry about the veggie benny (on mushroom caps). Mushrooms can get a bit soggy, and the rest of her food is WAY better :) There are also a bunch of breakfasty drinks that are pretty great, and different from your typical juices at brunch. 

There's also a cute little patio, should be out that way in the heat! 

She also has frozen stuff for sale a lot (apparently the Irish sausages are tooootally worth it) and a bunch of British pantry fare. Really cute space, awesome addition to the neighbourhood, and only a shame that it's only open on weekends."}
{"text":"Kitchen on Sixth is a hidden little gem in the west (west) end of the city. The atmosphere is cosy and personal, the food is delicious, and the value is great for a brunch restaurant. The restaurant is not too big so its better to come a little earlier (before 1030) to avoid a wait.

Drinks are reasonably priced ($3.50) and very tasty. I had the basil lemonade and would definitely recommend. Coffee is served bottomless.

The food itself is very flavourful. I tried both the Benedict w Benefits and Breakfast Poutine. The benedict was a little lighter being served up on one well-seasoned mushroom cap. If you're hungry, I definitely recommend the poutine. The gravy has you wanting more (as opposed to getting fed up after a few bites on standard poutine).

The one server was friendly and food came out in a timely manner. All in all, a brunch place that I will definitely return to. They are moving in October so be sure to double check for their new address! (132 6th Street is their current location).

Parking is available on street off Islington for free on weekends."}
{"text":"I've been to Kitchen on Sixth's original location before they moved last year. The new restaurant is bigger, the vibe is casual, and the food is great, especially given the price.

Food options are limited to less than 10 items on the menu - I've tried the Posh Mushrooms, the Eggs Benedict, and the Breakfast Poutine. All are pretty savoury and the food is very filling. 

One of my other favourites is the drinks - all affordably priced (unlike brunch spots), you can get some great specialty ones for $3.50. I recommend giving the Strawberry Tea Lemonade a try. Prepared with David's Tea, and some sparkling Lemonade, it's a great drink along with your meal.

Service is friendly and quick. The waitress brought out the drinks and food in a timely manner and everything was delicious. Again, I'd definitely recommend trying this resto if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The brunch is the best in the city. The restaurant is quaint and cozy, and if you're looking for an reasonably priced and excellent meal, this is the place you should frequent!"}
{"text":"True authentic British restaurants are rare, and one so well run with generous British hospitality are rarer.  Having lived in the London, UK, for seven years, I appreciate how the Items on the menu are as British as it gets, including a full English Breakfast and delicious Elderflower mocktails.  What always brings me back is the incredible value for the food, portions are legit, quality of ingredients are fresh and tasty, and the atmosphere takes you straight into the heart of London.  Not to mention the patio is cozy and well decorated.  BlogTO got it right calling KoS best in the city.  I encourage everyone to come check out this quaint British goldmine with snarky memes to make you forget there's an outside world."}
{"text":"This spot is a must if you're in the New Toronto area.  Jenny (the owner) is an exceptional host and the food portions are excellent and very well priced.  The poutine is next level...it has the best fresh cut potatoes outside of PEI and that's saying a lot because we all know how good PEI potatoes taste!

The house made specialty juices are delicious and the always on $5 draft/drinks make this a no brainer.  This spot is a real gem...check it out...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"UPDATE: it's been a little while since I made
my first visit here and nothing has changed...place is dirty, I won't be eating here again.

After reading the review on BlogTO and knowing that  there aren't many breakfast/brunch spots in the area I figured I would give this place a try...I walked in on a Sunday morning and was greeted with an unpleasant smell. I can't really pinpoint it, it was just unpleasant. The restaurant is small and cosy. It's well decorated and there is a large window up front that lets in a great deal of natural light. A girl was at the back of the kitchen and told me she would be with me in a moment. As I looked around the kitchen area I saw that the cooking areas appeared clean, but were actually quite dirty. The floor looks like it hasn't been washed in a little while, the appliances weren't the cleanest either. At this point I realized that odor was likely coming from the kitchen. I ordered a tea (English breakfast) sat on the patio, had my tea and left. I will return in a month or two to see if things improve."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!! Was tired of loud and rushing atmosphere of a local eatery. Kitchen On Sixth satisfied my need for quiet contemplation. The food was Stellar and the owner very welcoming. Great future for this soon to be Hot Spot. Watch out world. 
Bonnie :)"}
{"text":"Took my fiancee for a Father's Day brunch. Went early as the owner was willing to accommodate a reservation as an exception (we had our newborn with us).
Nice patio, small but cozy inside. We grabbed a table outside and enjoyed it, despite the location. Not the best situated place but love the english breakfast concept and the fact that it's in our local neighbourhood. Food was solid quality, not a big fan of english brekkie but went along with it and enjoyed my dish (the Benedicts - although the mushroom caps could use some flavour like balsamic for example) and my fianc√© had the Full English and really liked it. 
Also well priced and their bottomless
Coffee is delish!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I spent a few years living in London so were super excited to come to this place for brunch.  My husband ordered the full English, which was delightfully authentic (white and black pudding!  Yay!) and I ordered the French toast, which was the perfect size and had an amazing elderflower cream cheese and strawberry sauce.  The last time I had eaten a meal faster than my husband because it was so good was at Chez Panisse!!

The food did take awhile to come but the service was super friendly and it was such a cute place we didn't mind one bit.  We will definitely be back again (and for the Sunday roast as well.)"}
{"text":"Just read blogto and this was the only one we have not gone to so decided to try it out. I was hoping it would be amazing as it is in the neighborhood but it was rather disappointing.

Atmosphere: cozy small restaurant with warm decor. Large parking lot nearby and street parking. 

Price: decent. On par with the rest of the local brunch places.

Service: super slow. Took 40 min for food for two. It would be faster if we had stayed home and cooked ourselves. We were one of 3 tables there and seems like the other couples were there for awhile. No one greeted us when we came in. We assumed and sat ourselves. The place became packed within 30 minutes. We were the only table eating. Did not ask if I wanted greens or fries and just gave me fries. The waitress was friendly but she seemed flustered. 

Food: the fries were well cooked and crispy. The sausage and peameal bacons were good. But they ran out of food at 10 in the morning. How is that possible? They only have about a dozen menu items and not that many ingredients. They ran out of english muffin for my eggs benedict and substituted it with a slice of bread. They didnt tell me until the plate arrived and said we gave you extra bacon because we ran out of English muffin. The bread was so hard, I have never had hard bread for egg benny before so that was weird. The mustard on the egg benny was a nice touch. The eggs werent cooked well as one was soft and the other was solid. My husband's meal they ran out of mushrooms. The guy next to us they told him they ran out of corn hash. I am so confused how a brunch place run out of so many ingredients when it was still early and they had only opened for an hour. The cucumber juice was gross. 

I would give this place another try maybe in a year when they get their act together."}
