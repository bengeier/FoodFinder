{"text":"Great service and atmosphere, hit or miss on the menu, high prices for normal food.    Drinks: they have a fun menu, even a unique variety of bottled sodas - hit!  Biscuits:  just ok, good to munch on - the butter had an off taste - how can you mess up butter?  - this was a miss  Apps:  we had the fried green tomatoes, light, hot and crispy - the sweet corn relish was so fresh - this was a winner  Entrees:    chicken and waffles, boneless chicken - one piece white meat, the other dark meat - chicken was seasoned (but on the salty side) and juicy, convenient to eat without the bone, but the waffles were like a hush puppy batter - too dry and dense. Reminded me of stuffing - this dish would have been awesome served with gravy instead of syrup - overall a miss  Shrimp and grits, nicely done - perfect portion, asparagus was a nice touch.  Wish the shrimp was pan fried or had some Cajun spices, it was cooked nicely poached in butter - but wish it had just a little something more either in flavor or texture,  overall though we were happy with this dish - so a hit!  We would have given the place 3.5 stars, but sticker shock at the bill - about $60 for two without alcoholic drinks, a bit high for fried chicken and boiled shrimp no?  We'll probably stick with Zanzibar for our Southern food fix."}
{"text":"SOHO - help me out here.. I want to be in love with you, I do... My original review is below but visit #2 was still no more than average - though I wish I could write so much better...  ON the plus side... Your service is still very pleasant/attentive and space is very nice and you are trying hard, I think.  ON the \"needs improvement side - i'd love more flavor - well, ANY flavor - in your mains and better temps on your food. Lukewarm or cold biscuits, broccolini and mahi mahi don't cut it. Could the empty dining room last night be a reflection on other diners' similar experiences? I hope not.  Don't be afraid to add a few more dishes to menu (menu skews to the light side on choices), to wallop us over the head with super Southern flavors and to experiment with different portion sizes or pricing to be comparable to nearby restaurants like Bar Cento, which include a full side with entrees."}
{"text":"The fried green tomatoes were great.  As was the gumbo.  The food was not otherwise noteworthy.  It's a southern theme.  The fried chicken had good flavor but the meat was dry.  They used boneless chicken breast which didn't help the juiciness.  This place is middle of the pack as far as dining options in Ohio City."}
{"text":"I wanted everything on the menu. Went here on a recommendation from a tattooist down the road and he was spot on. The honey lemonade was a surprising start to the meal, which was served with complimentary biscuits and preserves. I had the boil broth thing...sorry, forgot the name, with about everything in it. It was delish. My wife and the pumpkin squashages, which she tried and tried to figure out the recipe for the next day. The price was a little higher and the atmosphere was a bit dressy, but a great place to go on a whim, too. Go here, it's good stuff. And. They. Have. Cheerwine!"}
{"text":"I was recently in Cleveland on business and brought my team to Soho for dinner prior to a day of meetings. We each got a crafty cocktail (the jalape√±o salt rim on the El Paso is everything) and a variety of chicken and waffles. Mine was \"morning style\" - the combo of earthy rosemary, briny chicken and sweet maple - holy moly. That's good stuff. I tried a bite of the \"late night\" too, and the smoked cherry bbq sauce was goooood. The service was a little slow, but there weren't a ton of waitstaff working so we didn't sweat it. It wasn't too busy on a Tuesday evening. We were too stuffed for dessert, but I shoved a few Charleston Chews in my pocket on my way out the door and promptly forgot about them...until the next day when they saved me from a meeting-induced sugar crash. Thanks, Soho!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night... Can't say enough good things. Service was perfect...hostess was very nice... Drinks were $9 but strong and made very well...Kevin was attentive and helpful behind the bar. We ordered \"snacks\"...2 each because we assumed they would be small...wrong!!!! They were huge. Everything tasted fresh and very flavorful. I will definitely be going back for dinner.  I regret not taking pics of the food as a reference.  Gumbo...on point, large bowl. Hush puppies.....very good....6 of them Fried green tomatoes, so good...large portion Meatballs....good 6 of them Cauliflower grits....amazing.  large bowl Please try this place."}
{"text":"I don't know what I was expecting, but any negative preconceived notions I had -- out the window by the time our first round of drinks arrived. The atmosphere is great! Not too big, not too small, and very welcoming. The mac and cheese is divine, the best I can remember having, and the boneless chicken was perfection. Not a huge beer selection, but I think their focus is more on the mixed drinks/spirits. Great service, and very welcoming atmosphere. I wholeheartedly recommend visiting SOHO!"}
{"text":"My family visits SOHO often and absolutely love the food! My fiance proposed to me there and we love the place. The Late Night and Evening are our favorites as well as the Banana Pudding. The SOHO sauce is also a must! Great customer service, fast order time and the intimate atmosphere make for a wonderful date in the evening. Great parking also, we always find a spot right by the place.   Price for the food is great, in my opinion. The fried food isn't overly greasy and really tastes guilt-free! Fried Green Tomatoes also, excellent! I recommend that you get an appetizer, dinner and dessert!"}
{"text":"Soho never disappoints. Consistently great food, reasonable prices and fantastic service. Our pigs in a blanket and (6) deviled eggs were the best! We then shared the fried chicken, jojos, Mac 'n cheese... Delish! Our server was so attentive and hospitable, wish I knew her name.       (Short hair, great smile). We loved how the Chef presented our dinner too. Fabulous experience!!"}
{"text":"Forget southern cooking's rep for being too heavy or rich--SOHO's appealing food presentation is an unpretentious lead-in to innovated southern comfort food. At a very satisfying price. This Ohio City gem serves lunch or brunch only on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, but is open for dinner every night except Monday. Its simple decor is as comfortable and welcoming as its staff.  SOHO rotates its menu, so I'll just say that everything our table ordered hit the mark on every level!"}
{"text":"SOHO, you had me the moment you set your warm buttery biscuits in front of me. It really doesn't matter if you're trying to watch your girlish figure. You pick up the knife, slice open one of those bad boys and slather it in salted honey butter and apple butter. You just have no choice. These biscuits sent me into what I lovingly refer to as a \"food frenzy\". They are just heavenly goodness in your mouth. I washed down my biscuit with one of their cocktails made up of tequila, orange and passion fruit juices--very refreshing and definitely not shy on the booze. Our table shared the deviled eggs and they were without a doubt the best I've had. These aren't your mama's deviled eggs--these tasted fresh and tangy with dijon mustard instead of that icky yellow mustard biznass. Per the recommendation of my lunch mates, I had the rainbow trout. It's stuffed with crab and sat atop some very tasty mashed cauliflower. Trout might not be as alluring as some of their other menu offerings, say for example the fried catfish po boy my husband had but it was very flavorful and well-prepared. Speaking of the po boy--although a tad heavy for me, the vinegary slaw on top of it helped lighten it up and it was quite good! I will definitely be back for brunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't made it to SOHO sooner. Maybe because it's more low key than other places on 25th? I seem to never hear anyone talk about it. Well, I finally made it to SOHO, and it was delicious. I can't really think of any complaints!  Let's start with those biscuits... Probably my favorite part of the meal. So. Good. Melt in your mouth good. Served with apple butter and herb butter. I could have just made a couple more of these babies my meal. The biscuits alone are why you need to get here.   We started our meal off with deviled eggs and chicken fried oysters. The deviled eggs were a classic recipe with crumbled pickled carrots on top. Good, no complaints. The chicken fried oysters were the weakest part of the meal. Not bad, but not amazing either. There was too much breading to the part where they dwarfed the oyster and it was all you tasted.   Next we had the tomato bisque. Generous portion. Served with a camembert grilled cheese, perfect for dipping in the soup.  Now onto the most important part, the fried chicken. It was really hard to choose between the mornin' style (rosemary waffles), evenin' style (collard greens and mashed potatoes), and late night style (pulled pork mac n cheese). We ended up going with the evenin' style. We don't regret it, but if we go back I think we'd do different. Everything was good. The sausage gravy was sweet and the perfect accompaniment to the fried chicken. I think the chicken had too much breading, and a lot of it was falling off.   If I could do half stars, I'd give SOHO a solid 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"The staff at Soho was more than accommodating to our large party.   I was coming into town from NC for a wedding and called ahead to make a dinner reservation.  We then decided to do the Happy Hour in the bar area instead.  They offered to reserve 3 tables for us.   It was a great experience overall and the food and drinks were very good!   I'd recommend Soho Chicken & Whisky for happy hour or dinner.  Top notch food and service!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite Cleveland restaurants! The Sunday Brunch is AMAZING. Chicken and Waffles, Breakfast potatoes, BISCUITS....yum. Please do yourself a favor and go to SOHO!"}
{"text":"I was really psyched for SOHO to open. Having spent the past few years in the South, my husband and I were excited to once again have access to southern food. The atmosphere was 5 stars, the service was 6 stars, and maybe we just picked the wrong things on the menu, but the food was mediocre. I hate to have been disappointed by it because I was really pulling for SOHO, and I'm sure we'll try it again!   The happy hour cocktail (the Corpus Christi, I think), was a strange blend of carrot juice and some but not all of the ingredients that would have made a good bloody mary - it reminded me of the time in 7th grade a friend poured pickled juice into my orange juice to trick me. It was just weird.  We got Oysters Rockefeller, but the greens in it were really stringy and I did not enjoy it at all. My husband described his steak as \"decent,\" but the Grayson cheese and fried egg combo on the grilled cheese was too funky - it fell more towards palate-challenging than comfort food, and the BBQ chips that it came with were good, but not remarkable. The biscuits were good (but would have been nicer had they been warm), and plenty of other plates leaving the kitchen looked beautiful and delicious. And even though we weren't blown away by the food, we were too stuffed to order the little donuts I coveted from across the room.  In sum, we left feeling full, but not necessarily satisfied. We'll have to try again soon and be better about choosing our dishes, I think."}
{"text":"My wife and I came to Soho at the last minute at 7:15 on a Friday night. The place was packed. The hostess approached us a minute later and offered us seats at the bar or at a 2 person table which she quickly had bussed and cleaned. As we waited in the doorway 3 different employees approached us to make sure that we had been taken care of.   The busboy was very friendly as was our waitress. My wife and I were in a hurry (we had about 55 minutes before we had to pick up our son from a dance) and we quickly selected the crawfish appetizer and pork chop entree to split.  As we waited we were brought some excellent small homemade biscuits. They were light, tender and tasty. They came with a whipped butter and a sweet jam-like spread. Neither added much to the fantastic biscuit to suit my tastes.   Before we ordered the waitress told us about the specials and we changed our order and got some sort of empanada dish (3 of them on the plate) as an appetizer. They were stuffed with chicken, rice, and a few other ingredients. The shell was properly fried - not greasy, yet crispy. The fillings were tasty but there could have been a little bit more filing since much of the interior of the empanada was air. They came with a spicy green sauce that was very good and a sweet potato sauce that was a bit flat.  Our main dish was the southern style bbq ribs. It was a beautiful vertical presentation with three sets of 2 ribs stacked upon each other with some spicy red cabbage cole slaw. The ribs were perfectly prepared. They were extremely tender and meaty with a light, smoky rub. The slaw was great as was the little corn salad that was on the bottom of the dish. Surrounding the ribs was a circle of spicy red sauce which was fantastic dipping sauce for the ribs.  The waitress was considerate of our time constraints and got us in and out in under 45 minutes. Since it was Friday the place was loud, but the energy of the room was good and the service was outstanding  - ESPECIALLY for a Cleveland restaurant.  From my experience, Cleveland restaurant service lags FAR behind service found in most other mid to large cities. Soho was exceptional in this regard.   The price was right for what we were looking for. 2 beers, an appetizer and entree for $35.00  We were both satisfied.  My only suggestions would be to have more sauces available for the foods and more spicy condiments that could also be used on the biscuits. The sweet, bland sauces just didn't cut it for my tastes. When I think Southern I think spicy & tangy. Also, the portions aren't very big, so a little more FLAVOR may give the customer a more \"full\" feeling.  In spite of those small complaints, we would definitely go back to Soho.  Tom"}
{"text":"I love the food.   First time here. Started with the fried green tomatoes and gumbo yaya..OMG SO GOOD!   Moved on to the shrimp and grits and fried chicken (no skin or bones. . Yay!) and gouda mac and cheese. ...Both DELICIOUS!!! Definitely will be back:)"}
{"text":"I have been eyeballing Soho since they opened, I'm just down the street.  I've been dying to go there. There's grits in that thar restaurant and I've been fixing to git me some.  I come from hillbilly stock on my mom's side. My friend and I met there at six on a Tuesday night. The bar was filled but we were the only table in the dining room. Misty was our waitress and she was just fine.  We didn't have cocktails, my friend is very pregnant and I just wasn't in the mood.  Instead I had honey lemonade and it was sweet and refreshing.  Misty brought us biscuits while we were looking at the menu. Biscuits like my granny used to make.  Good southern biscuits with 4 ingredients, no need to doll up a biscuit.  Served with a lightly sweetened butter and some jam.  Deelish.  We both got the same entree, shrimp, mushrooms, and asparagus over GRITS.  It was heavenly.  The grits were almost the consistency of mashed potatoes and out of this world.  Had I been in the privacy of my own home I would have licked my plate.  But I'm a lady in public.  Misty was very attentive but not cloying.  She suggested pecan pie for dessert but we were both satisfied.  The portion size of our meal was just right. By the time we go up to leave the restaurant was more than half full.  Next visit I'm trying one of the Po Boys and the cheesy grits appetizer.  I loves me some grits."}
{"text":"Soho Chicken + Whiskey seems to have been our \"fall back\" when looking for places to eat on W25th.  Well, no more!  This was our second time going.  Food is amazing and service is wonderful.   Last night we stopped in when another restaurant had a 2 hour wait and the hostess (who is one of the owners) squeezed us in immediately, despite the wait THEY had.  She didn't have to do that and was nothing but gracious.  Turns out, once we were seated, we found out that the couple that was to join us was going to be half an hour late!  Which made us feel badly, but they seemed totally fine with it, despite their busy evening.  The place was buzzing with families, couples, and groups.  Rightfully so, because...now about the food.   I think three of us had Morning, Evening & Late night style fried chicken entrees (oh the side pairings! So great!).  The fourth of us ordered a la carte chicken with sides.  The chicken is light, juicy and so tasty.  Between us, we also had the deviled eggs (yum), hush puppies, and the delicious flaky, light biscuits with that awesome rosemary butter and berry apple(?) butter.  We all had the \"Blacksburg\" bourbon cocktail, which was amazing.  Don't miss this happy place.  It's a keeper for W25th!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with their eggs Benedict. No runny eggs. The shrimp in the shrimp and eggs weren't seasoned. I don't think salt made it on the shrimp. However, the grits were good."}
{"text":"Visited SOHO for the first time as an out-of-town southerner (grew up in Louisiana) this past Saturday visiting family. When it comes to southern food, I am highly critical and it was such a disappointment. Ordered the jalapeno hush puppies and though it had a nice outer crust, the inside was dry. I had the fried chicken, collard greens, and mashed potatoes for my entree. Both pieces were very dry and tough to eat. The collard greens were too acidic. Five of the eight in our group ordered fried chicken and ALL WERE FRIED DRIED! Frankly I had better fried chicken at KFC and Popeyes! Giving this place 1 star was too generous. One and done!"}
{"text":"Came for a drink while waiting for reservations nearby, and ended up canceling our original dinner plans to stay at Soho. The vibe was chill, the bartender was attentive and helpful, and the food and drink was fantastic. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Yay for a fun southern menu! and a really good one as well! I had the Catfish po-boy and that is what I would get again if I went back. Our service was great and they mentioned wed nights are the best time to go.....deals on their fried chicken I guess. Our table ordered shrimp and grits, fried chicken, and the ribeye....everyone's plates were cleared. I really liked this place! We did get the pimento cheese dip which we thought was just OK----but as for everything else, 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I want to swim in their biscuits and rosemary butter for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"SOHO Kitchen & Bar is a great addition to the already dynamic restaurant scene on West 25th. With the likes of Crop, Flying Fig and Momocho within a small distance, you have to deliver. The ambiance is wonderful and the menu doesn't disappoint. A Southern inspired menu with a dash Southern hospitality.  Have enjoyed several of their appetizers: the Oysters Rockefeller, Fried Green Tomaters, Crawfish Fritters, and Pimento Cheese & Chips. We've also tried and enjoyed these sandwiches the Fried Green Tomato BLT and the Catfish PO'Boy. The Bacon & Deviled Eggs both as a Salad with Bibb lettuce avocado, corn roasted tomato, charred jalapeno vinaigrette or, as a Side are not to be missed.  Some of the dinner entrees we've enjoyed at SOHO. Chicken & Waffles, a dish that is on many menu's throughout the city, though no one goes the extra mile as SOHO. Their's is crispy fried buttermilk chicken, sweet potato waffles, with house made bourbon maple syrup. The Shrimp & Grits poached prawns Anson Mills grits, asparagus, peppers and wild mushrooms is another comforting dish. And then of course the best steak in town is SOHO's 17 dollar ribeye with a fried egg, fingerling-spinach hash, pickled vidalias withTabasco hollandaise.   Unfortunately, the only dessert we've  had room to try is the pecan pie which is sensational. Hope to try the beignets soon."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I think it's just average. We got the chicken fried oysters, morning style fries chicken and deviled eggs. I definitely enjoyed the delicious biscuits with apple berry butter and the Rosemary waffle that came with the fried chicken more than the rest of the food! I thought it was a little odd that the fried chicken is just two boneless, skinless chicken breasts that are battered and fried.   Tip: make a reservation for the weekends. We got a table without one, but were warned that they 'needed it back in 1 hour and 40 minutes'. Wasn't the best start to our visit..."}
{"text":"The mornin' style tofu and waffles is my favorite vegetarian dish in Cleveland, and I'm grateful that the management bothers to have such a robust list of bourbons available."}
{"text":"It was my first time at SOHO, so I came with no expectations. I didn't know how mobbed it would be on a sunny Sunday, so I did make a reservation for a noon brunch for 2. My friend arrived before me and got us a table on the patio.  We were seated in the shade and the staff provided blankets on the backs of our seats in case we got cold (super thoughtful).  Drinks ~ my friend and I tried most of the brunch beverage menu. The $7 price point is awesome and the standouts were the rhubarb mimosa, gin fizz, and bloody with a beef jerky straw.   Food ~ We ordered an avocado toast immediately due to hungover starvation.  This exceeded my expectations. The trout remoulade and pickled onions added the salty and brine factors needed to balance the creamy texture of avocado. So delicious and crave-able.  Next, we split the hush puppies with sausage gravy.  Also delish, but not as memorable as the toast.  The service was great - I asked our server to \"please not let my drink run dry\" and he happily obliged.  Overall, this was one of my best brunch experiences in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and drinks. They had a special menu for the NBA playoffs with some great snacks. Service is great; very personable and friendly (Lena is the best!)!"}
{"text":"I swung by this place with my bf after being in O.C. to look at a property and wanted to grab a quick bite to eat.  We had both been longing to go to SOHO so we figured what better time than now.  I will start off with saying that I've always loved the look of this place from the outside and was far from disappointed from my view from the inside once we got there.  We sat at a high top at the bar, which was perfect for the mood we were in and started with drinks.  I will say this - the bartender that night could make a mean dirty martini!  By far on my list of top 5 places for best martini.  Anyways, I wish I could say I was equally impressed by the food.  I ordered the deviled eggs, a salad, and a side of the broccoli and cheese (it's been a favorite of mine since I was a kid).  Now I will stress that I was in the middle of a cleanse diet, so I was trying not to stray TOO far off with the food because I would have normally ordered the chicken and waffles.  But our server kept insisting that the deviled eggs and broccoli were awesome so I ordered them, and I will sadly say that I didn't agree.  Boyfriend had the oysters rockefeller and the duck gumbo.  Both were good, but I wasn't blown away - he was satisfied but I don't think he was blown away either.  The menu isn't very large, but there are a lot of options in terms of the variety of food offered (if that makes any sense).  I think this is a great place to split some plates with some friends and grab some drinks and I'm not saying I'll never go back and try some of the other things on the menu (and I'll remember not to be dieting the next time I stop there) but all in all the food is good but nothing all that mind boggling."}
{"text":"I truly love this place.  While most people will gravitate towards the Chicken and Waffles, my go-to favorite meal in Cleveland right now is the ridiculous Low Country Boil.  Fish, crab claws, shrimp, sausage, corn, potatoes and sopping bread...my mouth is watering.  Try it...you will love it.  Great comfort food!  They also have an amazing whiskey selection."}
{"text":"Wow, this chicken was bomb! I have had fried chicken from many different places and this place by far is the best! We heard that this place was good but were not expecting it to be this good! The complimentary biscuits were amazing especially with the apple butter and the rosemary infused butter. I ordered the Gentlemen's Breakfast drink which was on happy hour and it was good! I ordered the late night but had them substitute the collard greens with mash potatoes instead. It was all good! Super delicious! The batter on the chicken was super crispy and the chicken was moist. I was a bit skeptical about not having a bone in the thigh but it was great!  I do recommend you get both pieces (thigh and breast) as one may not be enough.   Please visit this place! It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Friday evening as most of the rest of the street was packed, SOHO had some space.  The drink menu was very good, a lot of different beers and the cocktails were well made.  The food was nothing special, and defiantly not southern in more then name and advertisements. With just ok service and no real unique draws I doubt I will try this place again."}
{"text":"Last time I was in town my family tried to go to Momocho without a reservation (duh..) and the friendly hostess recommended we try SOHO.  I'm so glad she did!  We all enjoyed our meals and will definitely be back for seconds another time.  The special veggie menu made my heart smile and my belly happy.  My sister was especially pleased with the low country boil."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The service is the only thing I would complain about.  Never Enough servers but the place is packed. I've been there 2 times and every seat was taken and there's two servers for the whole restaurant if there's more it sure doesn't seem like it! The food on the other hand is so delicious I've had the fried green tomatoes, The Hush Puppies, shrimp and grits, the chicken of course and almost all of the sides and everything is delicious! I would have given it five stars if not for the bad service I understand it's a busy place but then they should accommodate the customers buy hiring more servers!"}
{"text":"So far have been twice and we truly loved our experience.  Great addition to our neighborhood.  I've gotten the pork chop and the ribeye.  Both awesome.  My fiancee got the shrimp and grits x 2 because she liked it so much the first time.  Finished off our meal the last two times with super tasty pecan pie.  Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"Considering where I originated from (Richmond, VA), I am always eager to try \"Southern cuisine\" anywhere I go. I read an article in CleveScene describing this new place & had to try it out ASAP.  When you walk in you're welcomed by a bowl of Charleston Chews & a little sign that Paula Deen would be proud of that reads \"Hey Y'all\". Cute touch. The decor is more modern & artsy...we loved the large metal cityscape!   I ordered an unsweetened ice tea & hubby ordered Abita Jockamo IPA (yummy!!!) & we decided to try the \"S'uthern Snacks\" starter. It was a fancy cheese board with a small stack of what was referred to by our waitress as \"American Proscuitto\"...naturally we laughed at that description, it was really good & moist, thinly shaved country ham. We both would prefer more country ham & less fancy cheese. Maybe just the brie & goat cheese. The pickles were picked fruit & the tomato jam was not very appealing, unless eaten with the brie which toned it's pungency down.  For dinner, hubby ordered the Chicken 'n' Waffles & I ordered the Fried Green Tomato BLT Po' Boy with a side of Cheesy Grits.   The chicken was so crispy & had the best coating on it that I've ever tasted, it was perfect with the tiny sweet potato waffles & the scrumptious bourbon maple syrup. They could do one heck of a brunch business on Saturdays & Sundays with this Southern classic. The only thing I would recommend is either putting more waffles with the chicken or making the waffles bigger. Everything else about this dish was great. Especially the bourbon maple syrup!!! YUM!  The Fried Green Tomato BLT Po' Boy was pretty good. While the tomatoes are obviously not in season right now, they were deep fried & cooked enough to soften them up properly. What made this sandwich wasn't the tomatoes, it was the BACON. It was thick cut, smoky & divine. I think this BLT could've used mayo instead of the tomato jam it comes with, but that's a personal preference. I only ate half of the Po' Boy & took the rest home. It was excellent the next day with a little bit of mayo on it. This dish comes with a side of house made potato chips that were great. Hubby ate most of mine, as I wanted to save my carbs for my Cheesy Grits.  About those grits...quite honestly, these were the best cheese grits I've ever eaten. They were made with a very rich & creamy cheese, they weren't too salty, they were pure perfection. I'd never had grits that weren't kind of gritty...these were smooth, silky & heavenly. I'm telling ya, these would go great on a  brunch menu as well!!!  We were highly tempted by the dessert & night cap menu, but decided we were just too full after all we'd had.   It was a good experience. Loved the atmosphere. Loved our waitress (Katie). Would like to see this place stick around for a while & see what the change in seasons will provide for the creativity in the menu options. There's tons of potential here."}
{"text":"Ohio City's latest is a very welcome addition. Located in the old Lelolai bakery/deli spot at W. 25th and Gould Ct, you might be surprised at the chic yet cozy decor inside. The menu is upscale southern food. While I wouldn't call it a healthy menu, what I ate and saw wasn't greasy, fat laden food at all.   SOHO  has a full bar, showcasing several mixed drinks. I wouldn't consider this a destination as a cocktail bar, but what I had was high quality (can't recall which drink I had unfortunately). The beer selection is good while even being a bit unique. There were selections I've never seen before.  We started with crawfish fritters, which are a southern spin on crab cakes. Very tasty.   I ate the pork chops. They were delicious, unbreaded, and lean. I wish the menu were online to refresh my memory about the dish. I just remember than I really liked it.  My date had the shrimp & grits. Again, very good, and neither dish was heavy.  I'd like to be more specific, but since this is a new place I wanted to get a review up rather than take the time to add specifics. SOHO lives up to its promise as an upscale take on southern cuisine. I can't wait to try out the rest of the menu. The Po'Boy looked amazing."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews on yelp, I had to try Soho.  I went here twice this weekend.  Friday night around 9:30 and Sunday brunch at 1:15.  Both times are a little late into service and that seemed to be good timing because we had a table right away.  Both times we sat in the back area closer to the kitchen and next to the bar.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  The few minor disappointments were far overshadowed by all the high points.  I feel that I will develop a few favorite dishes here, keep coming back, but be disappointed as it becomes more and more popular and I have to wait for a table, but such is life.  Anyway, for dinner I had the Fried Chicken, Evenin Style.  It was very good, fried perfectly with not too much breading.  A boneless breast and thigh came with a scoop of mashed potatoes and collard greens.  The greens were a tiny bit too spicy for me.  I also had the Ruby Cado salad for the first course.  It was delicious.  My only complaint here is that I hate salads on plates.  Can I please have a bowl so I don't spill it?  My date had Oysters Rockefeller for his appetizer and the corn cob salad for his meal.  He enjoyed both of these.  He especially loved his drink, made with Strawberry and Basil. I tried it and I think it would be delicious when warm weather finally arrives.  I had a Louisville which was also a great drink.  For brunch, we had Biscuits and Gravy, Skillet, and Chicken and Waffles.  The waffle with Rosemary was the most delicious waffle I've ever had in my life.  I don't even like waffles that much, and I want to go back to eat these again.  I had a peach mimosa which was fairly good.  My date had a Gentleman's breakfast to drink, which was very good.  The drinks here have clearly been thought out and the proportions are perfect.  Service was very good on both occasions, the only exception being that my friend was never offered a coffee refill at brunch.  As a side note, I loved that on Friday they were playing low-key rap music.  Most places would not have the balls to play rap, but it wasn't distracting and complements the theme of the restaurant.  On Sunday they were listening to Motown.  Two thumbs up.  I will be coming back for sure, maybe for their chicken scratch on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Love the biscuits we ate them all and they kept bringing us more. Po' Boy sandwich rocks!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, service, and atmosphere!  Biscuits, herb butter and apple butter to start.  Shakshuka, Chicken and Waffles, and Hush Pups and Gravy are amazing!"}
{"text":"Went for Chicken Pickin' Wednesday shortly after they opened. Got a made hightop table in front of the bar. Service was good and very attentive. Having never been to SoHo, I was intrigued when they brought out homemade biscuits with some awesome homemade butter and jelly...nice touch.   My order consisted of 2 drumsticks- 1 regular 1 spicy, Mac and Cheese, and mash with gravy. Heard good things about the eggs so we got a snack portion.   Deviled eggs were on point. Great flavor. If I decide to come back, might try the fancier ones.  As far as the chicken goes the meat was cooked and good. Skin was nice and crispy. But, the spicy chicken doesn't fuck around AT ALL. It was a bit ridiculous after one bite and I kind of regretted getting it. Once I got that shit settled I moved on to the rest of the plate and wasn't really blown away.  While the outside skin was for the most part crispy, it seemed as if the chicken could be cooked longer to penetrate whatever they use to coat it with. Both pieces had that kind of raw batter layer underneath still that made the skin seem clumpy.  Mac and cheese was ok. Could have used some salt and pepper. Really did not care for the sweet gravy used on the mashed potatoes either. No beuno for me.  Service was good, food was meh and didn't seem to justify my high bill at the end. In no rush to return any time soon."}
{"text":"I don't usually order pork dishes but the chicken fried pork salad sounded great, and I wanted some deviled eggs.  It was delicious.  Everything was very fresh and the pork was cooked nicely.  Service was great too.  I had the kitchen brew drink, others tried the alcoholic iced coffee drink and the Bloody Mary.  All said they were good.  Solid brunch spot."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant. The fried chicken looked really good, but I opted for a vegetarian diet. I ordered fried green tomatoes and the southern fried tofu. The fried tofu was a bit salty, but it was very good. The sides were okay. I had mac & cheese and greens. The greens were dressed up with onions. (I think Stonetown/Zanzibar have better tasting sides.) The service at SoHo was good too. Everyone in my party enjoyed this restaurant. I will be back.  I don't think there are any vegan options on the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I love southern food and especially Mac and cheese and this is one of the few places I have found in the area where the Mac and cheese is pretty amazing. They have quite a variety of southern foods so there should be something for everyone. We went on a Wednesday most recently and got to pick a few things that we like off a special Wednesday menu. Pick pieces of chicken with some small sides at a very reasonable price. It's s great place to try out."}
{"text":"This place was is amazing. The food is amazing, the drinks are good and service is prompt. This restaurant provides an intimate, warm and comfortable setting. Food is definitely worth the trip. In a great location on 25th street and in the midst of all the bars and action. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"You don't normally think 'soul food' when you think Cleveland, but if you've got a hankering, then SOHO's the place to go.   Last night we started off with their sweet corn chowder and fried green tomatoes. The chowder was excellent-full of corn that had all its structural integrity and dotted with pieces of tender asparagus and deliciously creamy slices of fingerling potatoes. I would've been more than happy to drink the broth with a straw! The tomatoes were equally great. The crust was shatteringly crisp, the tomatoes were delicious, and the sauce they top the tomatoes with absolutely makes them.  SOHO's obligatory pre-meal bread isn't a bread at all-it's their sinfully fluffy biscuits. You get a healthy scoop of butter (ours was herbed) and some delicious preserves (last night, peach) to slather on. Liberally apply both to your biscuit. You won't regret it.  They have fried chicken three different ways there-the morning style, the evening style, and the late night style. All three have wonderfully crispy crusts, and perfectly cooked tender chicken, but from there things get crazy. Morning-style fried chicken gets you chicken served atop rosemary waffles and dusted with powdered sugar, served along with the current syrup offering. You can't go wrong there. Evening-style is fried chicken the way most people know it-alongside wonderful mashed potatoes, that is. The late night chicken gets a potato chip crust and a side of their wonderful mac-n-cheese.  My personal favorite's the morning style chicken, but all three are amazing."}
{"text":"So many good things to say...! The atmosphere is great. They start by bringing out biscuits that will rival your mama's! The food...Mmmm. My friends had the chicken and waffles and mac n cheese and really liked them.  I had the Evening Chicken meal with mashed potatoes and gravy and collards.   Now it gets really interesting!!  The gravy is Sweet!  At first I kind of recoiled and was very scared!  But we were out for a fun night out so I thought I would just suffer though it.  Then I took another bite, and learned that this chef had come up with the Perfect Bite with this food combo.  The collards are bitter, the gravy is sweet and the chicken is salty...Nuff said!!!  I talked about my meal the rest of the night!! The Service - Outstanding.... Now comes the Kicker...  As I previously stated, I was so impressed with the Perfect Bite Combo that I told our server about it and asked about the chef.  She pointed to the man that had been serving tables, bussing tables and checking on all the customers!!! What??!!!  The Co-Owner and Chef Nolan was out in the restaurant making it happen!  When you see someone working so hard to give his customers an A+ experience you just have to have mad respect for them! Bravo Chef Nolan!!  We will be back and c'mon people we gotta support this place!!  It is worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, decently priced drinks, and some of the best chicken around. Some people may look for a larger menu, but if you do something so right, there's no need to mess with a bunch of other things."}
{"text":"OMG! The best fried chicken and macaroni and cheese I've ever tasted. Love this place. The server was vey attentive and checked on us periodically. Great atmosphere and amazing food. We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I had the chicken and waffles last fall, or was it summer?, at the street fair they had for The West Side Market.  It was so good I couldn't wait to go and get a real dinner.  I did end up waiting and my son and I went tonight,  We were greeted and seated nicely and quickly. Our first question was could we get the sweet potato ravioli with out jalapenos , which our server told us no, it's already in the mixture.  Ok, sensible answer, but we won't be trying them.  Next, my son wanted both soups, so we asked if he could get 1/2 serving of each.  Simple request, I thought.  The server immediately responded with, \"NO!  We don't do that.\"  Really?  Why not?  She went to the back to ask and came back and again told us no, claiming that the soup was made to order.  REALLY??   Soup is made to order but entrees aren't.  Rather ridiculous. (So the duck in the gumbo was slow cooked, apparently in ten minutes??) At this point, I'm irritated and would have preferred to leave and go elsewhere.  We stayed.  We both got chicken and waffles, which were good but for $16 I would like both pieces of chicken to be white meat, or at least given the option.  For $16 you get 1/2 a waffle, 1 piece of white meat, a fatty piece of dark meat and a tablespoon of syrup.    They had a nice selection of soda pop and they all come with a nice price of $3.50 each.  At least we saved money on the tip.    We went.  We ate.  I seriously doubt if I'll go back."}
{"text":"The menu was not the impressive. I had the shrimp and grits. I think they are alittle overpriced and did not think it was worth it. Plus the hot sauce was very nasty."}
{"text":"Been trying to get here for 2 years. It was worth the wait. Got sat quickly, got drinks and food quickly. About 6ish on a Saturday night. Food, Drinks, and Service top notch! We tried the cocktails with strawberry and watermelon. Both GREAT! The bring warm biscuits to the table while you wait. The pimento cheese was the best I ever had. My hubby had the low country boil and I had the shrimp and grits both great! Just go here!"}
{"text":"SOHO literally NEVER disappoints! The service is top notch, the willingness to accommodate is unlike ANY restaurant I've been too and the FOOD is indescribable! Do yourself a favor and go. Order anything, yes anything, and I guarantee you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Actual visit 6/29/13.  Fried chicken evening style & Deviled eggs.  One of my friends raved about this place so off we went.  Needless to say she oversold it.  Maybe it was because the bar was set wayyyyyyy to high, but I have had better and for less $$$."}
{"text":"Fried green tomatoes were good. Hush puppies undercooked. I planned to order the chicken & waffles but the guy at the table next to us said he'd had better. I ended up going with the chicken sandwich - that way I could be extra greedy and get pimento cheese as well. The food was just average. Chicken just average. I've had many, many places where the chicken was a lot better."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever going to brunch at SOHO and I was beyond impressed! I don't particularly care for their dinner so I was very hesitant to try brunch.  I started my brunch with one of their many cocktails; the Milk Punch. It definitely had a punch and was delicious! I tend to go for the classic mimosa and this was a great choice instead! The entree I ordered was the S'uthern Benedict. I am one to try eggs Benedict anywhere that offers it on their menu, this Benedict had a nice twist. The eggs were served on top of fried green tomatoes and were those cooked to perfection!! Even the potatoes on the side were perfectly cooked. I will definitely be going back for brunch!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night for dinner.  Had my mind made up before we arrived that I was going to have the chicken and waffles.  When I read the description on the menu, I saw the waffles had rosemary in them.  Not a big fan of the flowery herb, so I asked if I could get the waffles without rosemary.  Was told it's in the batter, so no, but the waitress said when I douse them in syrup, I won't taste the rosemary.  So I took her word for it.  And she was wrong.  Not only did the taste of rosemary permeate the flavors of the waffle, but the waffle was extremely dry.  I think it was made out of corn meal.  Kinda like eating sand.  All gritty and dry and flowery.  It came on the plate in 4 sections.  I only ate one.  The chicken was ok, but nothing to brag about.  Would have been nice if they had a Nashville hot chicken option, but they don't.  One little bitty breast.    The waitress came by several times, but never asked how I liked the waffles.  She later cleared the tables, including 3/4 of the uneaten waffle and again said nothing.  Maybe she was ashamed?  Or maybe just inept.  My guess is she works at an Apple store during the day and this is her second job, where she fine tunes her ineptness for her day job.  The other 2 dishes that came to the table included chicken, mashed and asparagus, as well as a chicken salad.  Both looked good and the girls each said they enjoyed their dinners.  Moves this review from 1 star to 2..."}
{"text":"Lovely spot for brunch, especially for those whose eyes are still partially open on Sunday mornings and cannot yet accommodate the piercing sunlight! Half of SOHO is pretty softly lit, creating a homey atmosphere.   For brunch I ordered the Southern Benedict. I didn't know what to expect with the fried green tomatoes substituted for the typical English Muffin but the swap was surprisingly delightful. I was afraid that the combination of fried green tomatoes and Tabasco hollandaise would put me in a grease coma but it wasn't too overwhelmingly rich. The eggs were perfectly poached and had a creamy texture. The country ham carried almost a prosciutto like flavor profile -- definitely not the $2.99/lb salty ham you would find on sale at your local grocer a during post-holiday clearance.   I wish I could give a five star review just based on the awesome Benedict alone, but that would not holistically reflect my dining experience. I snagged a piece of my friend's chicken and waffles and was quite disappointed. I understand the creative intention of pairing fried chicken with rosemary waffles, but sometimes, you shouldn't fix what ain't broken. To me, the rosemary was way too overpowering in a neutral waffle base: instead of complementing the crispy fried chicken, it was competing for attention on your palate. I had enough of the rosemary waffle after two bites. I can't imagine what my friend must have been going through.  Our wait staff was generally attentive and proactive. I was disappointed when she forgot about requests for more biscuits and ketchup :(   Overall, SOHO has a lot of things right but shouldn't be afraid of being \"boring\" for not pushing the boundaries on a classic dish. This place has decent options too for vegetarian friends. For example, they can substitute avocado for country ham in the Benedict which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Always a fun time at Soho! My husband loves the endless supply of bourbon, Kevin behind the bar is knowledgable about those bottles, and quite the mixologist, as well!  Great selection of delicious salads and beautifully crafted meals!  Can't wait until we get back again.  Cheers to Soho for consistency & 5 year anniversary in the Land!"}
{"text":"As someone who grew up in the South (Nola) I am more than critical when it comes to trendy restaurants spinning the \"southern\" theme. However, I was thoroughly impressed with SOHO. Their service is awesome and their food is delic! I don't know about y'all but I am sick of going to fusion/microbrew/tiny portion places! Just give me the grits! SOHO does and they are good!"}
{"text":"Oh, Soho, you are delicious.  I have to say... I somehow missed that there is a vegetarian menu available and the restaurant was lower on my list because I thought my options were pretty slim.  Boy, was I wrong.  The biscuits.  Oh, the biscuits.  SO dangerously delicious.  And then the friend green tomatoes?  You've gotta be kidding me.  I had the tofu and waffles, and it was easily one of the best meals I have had in a while.  It had the perfect amount of spice (for someone who can't handle spice) and the perfect amount of sweet to make it perfecto!  Service was great.  We had to wait some time for a table, but it's a great option that they will call you if you grab a drink elsewhere while you wait (there was no room at the bar... or anywhere).  Hit up a nearby bar we've been wanting to check out before a great dinner.  It's a win-win!"}
{"text":"Whether it is for Brunch, Happy Hour or Dinner, Soho is my favorite.  They have consistent quality, authentic southern dishes, great staff and great ambiance!!"}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours on W25th, I usually go with a few friends and we just order the whole happy hour menu to share. Good southern comfort food, I would eat the biscuits by the dozen if I could. The bartenders are great and there are good happy hour drink specials."}
{"text":"This has become my wife and I's favorite spot.  From the environment, to service, to drinks, to food and price.  Each and every category gets 5 stars, only because 6 star ratings aren't available.    The friend chicken is crispy and tasty.  The sides are well portioned but not overkill.  Neither my wife or I finished ours.  We have lunch tomorrow and couldn't be more excited about it.    I don't leave reviews often, but this has to be done. Do yourself a favor and eat here."}
{"text":"Finally got to eat here after a couple of failed attempts. To start, the service from every single staff member was brilliant and Molly made us feel so welcome and anticipated every need. The deviled eggs were amazing and then the hot sauce came and we inhaled them. The biscuit with herb butter and jam were so good my husband let me have a crumb. The shrimp and grits were delicious. Perfectly deveined and tail off shrimp that don't taste like bleach are surprisingly rare so I was super pleased with my delicious, perfectly cooked, sweet bits. My husband got the southern Benedict and he liked it so much he asked about the \"free refill\" once he'd licked his plate clean. We really enjoyed everything we are and would try everything on the menu without any regret. Will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Always great and inventive menu and specials. Nice drink selection. Great place to eat in a trendy area but not overly pretentious. Love the southern fusion menu. Nice little patio on the side when weather permits for people watching while you eat for your amazing food."}
{"text":"We did not have a reservation so we were told to wait by the bar and have a drink.  We literally stood by the bar for over 15 minutes before someone acknowledged us.  The place was busy so we figured the food would be good.  Deviled eggs were amazing.  Chicken was a huge disappointment.  Chicken tasted flavorless, the breading fell off easily, and it tasted like plain boiled chicken without salt.  Horrible.  KFC or Popeyes has better chicken and more flavor.  You can see this in the picture.  Big disappointment.  Our waiter also didn't bother asking us why we didn't eat the chicken or how we liked the chicken.. adding photo"}
{"text":"New favorite date spot! Apparently, I others thought this as the lone diner sitting along the glass walls overlooking a surprisingly busy alley was clearly waiting for his female date to arrive. At first, I thought he was checking me out as I walked toward the back of the restaurant to meet up with Bobo. I was so flattered by the head turning that I didn't even take in the chill atmosphere until I sat at our two-seater table. As I looked around at the welcoming bar and small dining area, the earthy (due to the dirt colored walls) yet urban (exposed bricks and picture windows overlooking streets) and somehow rural (cast iron pans hanging on the wall) new restaurant, I got a distinctly Brooklyn 2012 vibe. I'm guessing the name, Soho, is meant to evoke a different neighborhood in the big city, but the vibe is more fitting for my experiences ducking into new Brooklyn hot spots. The Southern Hospitality of the name comes across in the menu (and frying pan decorations). The menu integrates southern favorites with mod, innovative flairs. For example, cheese steak that's not steak, but brisket! The best part of this cheese brisket was that it was part of the happy hour special and only $7. The chalk board over the bar listed the happy hour drinks, all $4 or under, including a hand crafted raspberry-whiskey cocktail called the Chattanooga. If you know me, then you are familiar with my life rule #3: If I see a berry drink on a cocktail menu I have to order it. Hello yummy $4 Chattanooga that was perfectly frothy from egg whites! At this time, happy hour runs till 6:30. Obviously, that's subject to change.    2 super cute tiny biscuits are complimentary and served with some sort of butter. We ordered deviled eggs. My first criticism is that the deviled eggs were cut into quarters...I wanted more zip with my egg. Either give me half an egg so I can enjoy all the yolk-mayonaise goodness, or give me more zip with my yolk-mayonaise mix. My second criticism is that the chips were almost flavorless; the flavor that was there was sort of...yucky. Perhaps the fat used to fry them was yucky?  I'm not sure what it was, but I didn't like them. Also, after only paying $7 for a huge sandwich that came with chips (neither Bobo nor I liked them) and various pickled veggies, the $5.50 for what was probably 1.5 eggs seemed like too much. I'm not saying they're overpriced, but they seemed overpriced next to a $7 meal. Overall, I loved the experience and look forward to dining here often. Next time I'll ask about the chips and see if they ever serve them spiced, or can add salt, or see if others said they didn't like them. I am a huge lover of fried potatoes so yucky chips will not do on my plate.  Now, to find that date...."}
{"text":"Great food. Good setting.  I love going there for brunch.  The alcoholic drinks are top notch.  Some of the portions are small but that doesn't make them any less delicious.  The biscuits make up for it.   I have never been there and sat down immediately.  I would recommend getting a reservation especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Me and the bf visited here for happy hour recently, and holy happy hour!!!  Because I pretty much wanted to try everything, we ordered WAY more food than necessary. We were both fans of the mini complimentary biscuits and peach preserves, so good. Then for an appetizer we got the cheese plate. Pretty good, though I prefer the one at XYZ Tavern. I'd rather have a firmer cheese as opposed to spreadable. Just my personal preference though. It was still quite tasty. We also ordered the jalapeno goat cheese hush puppies. They were pretty tasty, though the sauce could use some seasoning. We both got sandwiches as our entrees. I got the Dixie Cheesesteak (usually $12, but at happy hour it's only $7!) let me tell you, it was AMAZING. I've had a lot of cheesesteaks in my life, and this was one of the best. The meat is brisket, and it was so tender and flavorful it melts in your mouth, and the cheese sauce was really good too. The bf got the Fried Green Tomato BLT. ( also a happy hour special $7 instead of $12). He loved it, he said the fried green tomato tasted just like his grandma from Alabama makes! The sandwiches come with pickled veggies, and home made potato chips. I wasn't a huge fan of the pickled veggies, as they bordered on sweet (I'm a dill pickle kind of gal), but the bf loved them, particularly the carrots and green beans. The chips were eh, but by the time I finished my sandwich I had ZERO room for them anyway.  They have a large selection of bourbons and whiskeys and quite a few specialty cocktails centered around those. We both agreed the drinks could use some work, and one vodka as an option wouldn't hurt either.  All in all a great new addition to the scene, and we will be back. I hope they change menus seasonally, so that i'll get to taste their amazing feta watermelon sald that they previewed at a 4th of July party last year!!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of the best restaurants in Cleveland.  Regardless of when you come you can count on a flawless dining experience.  Food: the best Southern cooking anywhere.  I never order chicken when I go out to a restaurant except at Soho; most restaurants over cook chicken, Soho's chicken is always tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked.  The fried green tomatoes are to die for.  Drinks: always an exceptional cocktail list with imaginative well balanced cocktails.  Staff: some of the nicest most professional staff you will ever meet.  Soho is not to be missed."}
{"text":"The best chicken and waffles in Cleveland, hands down.  My wife and I were craving chicken and waffles and went to Soho before a Saturday show at playhouse square. We were not disappointed. We got there right as the opened at 11am on a Saturday and they were packed within an hour. We sat at the bar and the bartender went above and beyond with how he took care of all his patrons, not just us.   He immediately brought us some of the best biscuits I have had along  with rosemary butter I believe apple jam.  They put Bob Evans to shame. I could just eat the butter and jam by the spoonful. We started off with a couple of beers but also sampled a whiskey flight called bottled in bind. I am not a whiskey guy but with his descriptions and the drinks themselves I came away with a new appreciation for the stuff, and a solid buzz.   We got the chicken and waffles (duh) and a side of maple bacon. I have no idea what they so to the syrup to make it so savory but it is to die for. I highly recommend their small batch hot sauce. They should sell it it is so good. The maple bacon is not a little 3 piece diner portion eother, they load you up with a hefty plate of bacon, medium cut, cooked to perfection and they don't skip the maple. I also saw several people order the deviled eggs and also the beignets and will definitely have to try them the next time we stop by for brunch.   If you are familiar with the West 25th / Ohio city area, then you know parking is a first come first serve game onto itself.  Like I said, best chicken and waffles in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner, amazing brown liquor selection as well as beers.  What's up with a BONELESS breast offering? Should be 4 stars but the white meat choice drags it down."}
{"text":"Quite dim on the inside but it was a groovy atmosphere. Came for an early dinner on a Friday evening 5:30pm and there was no wait at all. Saw a family come in with their toddlers too.  I got the Sunrise and my husband got the Late Night. Both came with fried chicken and you can choose between breast or thigh ($14) or both/two pieces ($17).  Fried Chicken: Very tasty, tender, and moist with a good crunchy exterior. It was very good!  Sunrise: Came with fried rice and a fried egg on top. The fried rice was a little too wet and sticky but had less and sweet potato and sausage in it. Was a little spicy because of some hot sauce they splash on the plate.  Late Night: The mac and cheese was good but the collard greens were excellent. Really tasty.  Great customer service too! Really friendly servers."}
{"text":"Best Waffle and Chicken Breakfast Ever (just make sure to add scrambled eggs & add on top of chicken). Great brunch and Bloody Mary with beef jerky straw.. Deviled eggs looked good and will def try next time. Friendly staff & nice atmosphere. You can also call head for reservation which is awesome. Be prepared to wait on weekend brunch. A must try & a fav weekend brunch spot. Gotta try the dinner menu on a weekday."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the ambiance at SoHo. It has a  very industrial but  cozy feel. I ordered the chicken and waffles because I heard so much about it. I was curious about these Rosemary waffles and i must say that the waffles tasted weird. The chicken was spectacular and the hot sauce was so good that I actually bought a bottle for my house. I'll visit again and avoid the waffles next time!"}
{"text":"The roommate and I went to SoHo to check it out and found it to be SoSo.  Pardon the pun.  As many have mentioned before me, the atmosphere is top notch.  You will want for nothing upon seeing the interior of this transformed W. 25th restaurant.  Continue to the service:  pleasant service is nice, but overbearing gets old fast.  The biscuits that were delivered were pretty tasty, though we both found them to be more dense than you'll find in the Deep South.    Carry on to the main event:  dinner.  I ordered the Catfish Po Boy, which came spilling out of the Italian Baguette it was intended to be eaten with.  However, I found that the overly-fried fish could not fit within the bread itself and ate the whole thing piece by piece.  Maybe the dish would work as a whole, but each piece was just as bland as the next - nothing noteworthy here.  The hush puppies were tasty, though the sauce (all two teaspoons of it) did nothing for either of us.    The roomie got the Pork Belly and Pimento Mac & Cheese.  She noted the Pork Belly as dry, amazingly enough.  That being said, she was impressed with the taste.  The mac & cheese was noted as \"ok.\"    Overall, it looks like the perfect amount of atmosphere and uniqueness that W. 25th caters to.  I'll definitely have to come back and try another dish, perhaps up that rating a little bit..."}
{"text":"We came in for brunch, and WOW...this place rocks!  I had the Southern Benedict, and Pom-Pear mimosa.  I ate every last bite, and would order the same thing 10x over.  I highly recommend trying Soho if you get a chance!"}
{"text":"I just went here for the first time last night and it was great! We had 6 people and no reservation and were seated immediately. It may have been due to the fact that it was a snowy, Wednesday, but hey, I'll take it. Comfortable seating and nice ambiance with friendly and helpful staff.  The food. We happily found out that Wednesday is their chicken special day. I got a spicy fried breast with smoked gouda mac & cheese and rosemary waffles with syrup. Before the meal came out we were served flaky biscuits with delicious apple butter and regular butter. SO GOOD. And the chicken and waffles did not disappoint. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Okay, all the other reviews are spot on.  Cool atmosphere, mediocre food.  The jalapeno hushpuppies were the best thing on the table but a restaurant should not rest on hushpuppy laurels to keep the doors open.  Pork po boy was disappointing...dry meat, dry/stale bun.  Pimiento cheese dip didn't have much flavor.  BBQ chips were good but could have used a touch of sweetness.  The biscuits they served when we sat down were dry.  The guy next to us ordered shrimp and grits and the portion was small.  I REALLY wanted to have a great experience here.   But it appears the kitchen is overlooking the little details in the food and for that, I won't go back.  There are too many other great places to eat in Ohio City and Tremont that nail the food every time."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in at Soho while on a brief mini-cation a few weeks ago. We LOVED this restaurant. The soul food had the perfect modern flair to it, and was absolutely delicious! I had the Evenin' meal, which won me over with the awesome mashed potatoes (seriously...so good). My hubby had the Late Night meal and thought it was wonderful! The cocktails were delightfully crafted, moderately priced, and worth every penny! The restaurant had a delightful, warm kind of ambiance. We will definitely stop in again the next time we're in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Soho and I was impressed. I came to eat with a friend for dinner yesterday. The food was expertly cooked. The meat was juicy and tasty. And the server was warm and very attentive. I cat wait to go back again."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Ohio City! I love the southern menu of Soho and the wonderful selection of dishes they have. It's a small restaurant, but patio seating makes it a bit better in warmer weather.  The biscuits with jam and butter that you get as a starter is DAMN DELICIOUS. I have often just wanted to order more of them and just have that for dinner. The main chicken courses vary by the sides: the Mornin', for example, is chicken and waffles. The Evenin' is collard greens and Mac and cheese. The chicken is deliciously coated in a corn flake batter and fried to perfection.  Service here is fast if you can get a table, but I would HIGHLY recommend making reservations if you plan to go later in the evening on a Friday or Saturday, or if you have a large group.   Come to Soho for the best southern comfort food you can find in the city, and leave feeling happy and full!!"}
{"text":"This place makes awesome fried chicken. We went here during Saturday brunch due to good Yelp reviews. We ordered the chicken and waffles and pollo frito. My friend got the tee time drink. We were first served complimentary hot biscuits, apple jam, and rosemary butter. How can something free be so delicious? The biscuits were hot and soft. The apple jam and rosemary butter were amazing.   Their chicken and waffles were great. It came with two fried chicken and 3 small waffles and maple syrup and powdered sugar. The fried chicken had a good crust that was well seasoned and was still crispy with the syrup. I have never had such good fried chicken, especially one that was boneless. The waffles were not flabby and were structurally intact with the maple syrup.  My friend loved the pollo frito. It came with a fried chicken, egg, pulled pork, and sauce. It was very spicy and the sauce had a good kick to it. I liked it more than the chicken and waffles due to the flavor.  The tee time was refreshing, but not too strong.   Overall, will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our brunch here. My boo grew up in the south (Nashville) so he knows good southern cooking. I've only recently tried fried green tomatoes (and loved it) so everywhere I go, if I see it on the menu, I order it! These were delicious, with a perfectly crispy batter on the outside, and a delicious sauce that went with it. We also wanted to see how the gumbo was (pretty delicious as well) and then of course, fried chicken. Their fried chicken was nice and crispy on the outside, and tender and juicy on the inside. The best part: no bones! They also make their own hot sauce, which was kind of tangy and not too spicy, but with a little bit of a kick. Perfect complementing sauce to go with the fried chicken."}
{"text":"SOHO Kitchen and Bar is a fried chicken joint. Not one of the mediocre variety mind you. No SOHO is a classy joint where you might hear Dan Hartman's \"I Can Dream About You\" playing in the background over the babble of satisfied customers and cheerful staff. Much like the 1980s crossover hit SOHO is part R&B, part Rock 'n' Roll and all badass.  SOHO's smooth southern cuisine is the R&B. The main attraction is Fried Chicken that is tender and perfectly seasoned. You can order the chicken mild or spicy. The spicy dry rub they use is a little too hot for my tastes; I prefer to order the chicken mild and supplement it with SOHO's house made hot sauce. On Wednesdays you can order fried chicken by the piece - boneless Breast $4.5, boneless Thigh $3.5, Drumstick $2.5, Whole Wing (so much bigger than a regular chicken wing) $1.5 - and sides a la carte for $3.5 each to customize your meal at a fantastic value.   I had gone a few times before trying the Mashers with Bourbon Gravy because I thought \"that's a pretty ordinary side.\" I have since recognized the error in my ways--the gravy at SOHO is addictively good. In fact the gravy is an essential component of what has become one of my favorite ways to consume fried chicken: I'll order a couple pieces of chicken, normally a breast and a thigh, add a fried egg on top if I want extra protein or just because adding a fried egg to meat can elevate the awesome to the sublime, the Rosemary Waffles with Ohio Maple Syrup, and ask for a side of gravy. Taking the already excellent chicken and layering the spicy hot sauce, the sweet syrup and the savory gravy you get a bite that is a gastronomical tour de force.   A final note on the fried chicken is the consistency. Since the restaurant opened in 2011 I estimate I've had close to 100 pieces of chicken cumulatively; not once could I accuse SOHO of the deficiencies that can plague fried chicken elsewhere: too greasy, too dry, or too crunchy. The fried chicken at SOHO is always on point.  If you elect to eat something other than chicken, you will be similarly pleased. The Fried Green Tomaters are best I've ever had, the Lowcountry Boil has a solid half-dozen delicious foods combined in a massive bowl, and they cook a mean steak too. Whenever SOHO is offering a supper special I order it without question and I've never been disappointed. Standout side dishes include Jalapeno Hush Puppies and Deviled Eggs.   I have never had dessert at SOHO - I've always been too stuffed from dinner - but I've heard their Pecan Pie is amazing. Amid the excitement of the food you're about to eat it is easy to overlook SOHO's artful plating: the food here looks as good as any other top tier restaurant.  The bar at SOHO supplies the Rock 'n' Roll, with the feature being the best bourbon collection in Cleveland. They have everything from the customary (e.g. Bulleit) to the premium (e.g. Blanton's) to the extra rare (e.g. Pappy Van Winkle). You also can't go wrong choosing from the house cocktail list either whether you go for the booze-laden New Orleans, the sweet Coral Gables, or my personal favorite the Lynchburg, made with whiskey, limeade, ginger beer and mint. At $8.50 each the cocktails are very reasonably priced for West 25th Street.  SOHO is also one of my favorite brunch spots. Served 11:00am to 2:00pm every Sunday, SOHO's brunch boasts delicious entrees--the Chicken-Fried Pork Salad is not to be missed; sides--bourbon-glazed bacon? Yes please; and breakfast cocktails. My favorites are the Gentleman's Breakfast, which is the whiskey drinker's answer to the mimosa, and the Dixie Russian, which is a tasty, tipsy iced coffee.  With consistently impeccable food and service SOHO is a dream come true even among Cleveland's crowded, top-notch restaurant landscape."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very cozy, service is friendly and fast.  Great whiskey glazed tofu!  A must for anyone vegan. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch before heading over to a Cavs game. Started off with the drinks I went with their special bloody Mary which was just OK I definitely have had better in Cleveland. My boyfriend was a whiskey drinker though and ordered something off that menu that he was very happy with so it does stay true to its name.  For food I went with the chicken and waffles which I was not disappointed about. I think it could've had something added such as a bit of raspberry or fruit on top to make the taste come together better but overall it was good the chicken breading was amazing it seem to be the same type that was on my mom's pork as well.  The winner here was the eggs Benedict southern style my boyfriend and I ended up sharing our meals and this is what he ordered. I was wishing that I actually had ordered this all to myself because it was pretty good.   They do serve biscuits with a type of spread   And butter that I can't recall Kurt completely but it was pretty good."}
{"text":"The service was quick, the food was great, biscuits were great with the fruit compote and rosemary butter."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner twice now, both times on a Friday. The first time I got one of the po boys. It was tasty but clearly not memorable or I'd be able to tell you which one it was. The second time I got the ribeye which was delish! We also shared a fried green tomatoes appetizer which was A-MA-ZING! My favorite thing about this place, however, is the drink list. The servers are also all very personable, more so than other restaurants."}
{"text":"It's good... It's not great.  Especially for the price.  Disclaimer - I'm not the biggest fan of Southern cooking, but because so many people raved about it, we wanted to check it out.  We started off with some complimentary biscuits (fair), and 2 cocktails (we didn't like either of them).  I had the sweet potato dumplings for dinner, and I thought they were \"just okay\".  It was a fairly small serving, and the flavor was too subtle.  The boy had the low country boil - which was flavorful, but not something either of us would go out of our way for.   We were underwhelmed.  It might be due to us not being true Southern food lovers.  If you love South in your mouth - you should go.  The service was perfect, that atmosphere unique, it just wasn't quite our speed."}
{"text":"The space is wonderful. My husband and I sat at the bar and had some drinks and appetizers. The bartender was lovely, pleasant and attentive. The hush puppies were great! Will gladly try this place again."}
{"text":"I'm typing this review up while I'm still sitting at the bar of this place because a) I'm dining alone tonight; b) I'm all caught up with my other social media crap and work emails and; c) the food, service and atmosphere were so good that I feel compelled before I forget.  But mainly B.   I'm in town for work so don't feel too bad for me.   Work pays for it!  I had the chicken with the Mac and cheese and collard greens and it was extremely delicious.  The chicken was cooked perfectly with a nice crust on it and not dry.  The Mac and cheese was creamy and flavorful (gruyere maybe?), and while I'm usually not a fan of collard greens these really hit the spot.  Excellent flavor with large chunks of some pork product in it.  Slightly bitter but really complemented the rest of the meal.    As for the bourbon selection, I have to say it was excellent.   They have way more bourbons and whiskey than are on their menu and they are reasonably priced for a city this size.  Would highly recommend.  Do t be surprised, they only do chicken here in various ways but they all looked incredible."}
{"text":"The wait was crazy long for Sunday brunch. The food was tasty and once seated we were taken care of in an very attentive manner."}
{"text":"I have only been here once but I will definitely be back. Great brunch. They have a couple different flavors of mimosas. Got the chicken and waffles, super good. Nice outside patio. They also have blankets for you to use if you get chilly. The staff was super nice too."}
{"text":"Excellent! Shrimp and grits were to die for (the shrimp were juicy and sweet). Pecan pie and burbon ice cream was excellent as well. Great beer selection. Don't pass Soho up!"}
{"text":"Went to soho kitchen on opening night. Really enjoyed everything from start to finish. Unusual cocktails with a southern spin. First out were biscuits with in house made peach butter and also tomato/bacon jam. Myohmyohmy the jam! 1st course we shared the sweet potato bisque. Do not be concerned from the description on the menu that it will be too sweet. It was deliciously savory with just a hint of sweetness. For entrees we enjoyed the dixie cheesesteak sandwich made with brisket,collards and beer cheese fondue and the smothered porkchops with goat cheese jalapeno hush puppies. Both were fanfreakintastic! After dinner we had a last drink at the bar, where I enjoyed some jack daniels honey, a perfect end to a southern inspired meal with a modern twist. Get on down to the soho kitchen, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Enjoy this southern style restaurant on E25. The side patio is nice in the summer. Wednesday is my favorite day to go as you can build your own chicken dinner. Large bourbon list."}
{"text":"Amazing fried chicken. All the sides were delicious as well and the BBQ sauce is spectacular. Bbq sauce have noted of cinnamon  and nutmeg, very unique. The hot sauce they provide compliment the chicken perfectly. Only had one cocktail, the Oxford which was alright. Very cucumber forward. Service was great and the interior is nice."}
{"text":"Very impressive; great value. Duck Gumbo was excellent. Ribeye w/ fried egg was brilliant (and excellent) and the pecan pie was the best I have ever had. Can't wait to come back and try everything else."}
{"text":"Came here for an anniversary and was absolutely NOT disappointed! Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, got seated right away, and really had the chance to explore a new kind of menu.   We started off with the fish dip. The combination of catfish, crab, avocado, lemon and hot sauce complimented each other perfectly! I'm not a huge fan of fish at all but I found myself really enjoying this appetizer. They also give you complimentary biscuits with apple butter and another fancy butter spread that was absolutely delicious.   For entrees, we were completely satiated with the \"Sunrise\" and \"Late Night\" chicken dinner dishes. The fried chicken was delicious! The greens were perfectly cooked to how they should be and the fried rice was such a wild combination that I couldn't stop eating.   I highly recommend this place to others. Looking forward to going again!"}
{"text":"For my Dad's birthday he wanted Chicken and Waffles.  Both online and word of mouth suggested Soho for the best in Cleveland.  We came here for brunch and according to him they lived up to their reviews.   They started us out with biscuits and a delicious butter and apple jam.  I had an apple cider mimosa, which I suggest skipping, it was ok but I've had better.  And for my main course I ordered the hush pups and gravy.  My meal was large and I was able to take some home for a delicious treat later.  This place filled up fast, so make sure you have a reservation or be prepared that you might have to wait."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  SOHO has hands down the best fried chicken and biscuits. Be sure to try the hushpuppies and chicken & waffles! SOHO's customer service is great too.....definitely my favorite place in the area!"}
{"text":"First time here tonight - we had reservations for 9 - were seated within 10 minutes of arrival - enough time to get a drink at the bar.  Ordered a typical whiskey & soda - had to point out the bottle to the bartender who told me twice they didn't have that whiskey...mmmkk ok.  Still that happens right?   We were seated and decided to all try different things to share at the table - as such I will just list what we had:   Jalape√±o hush puppies - not spicy, almost sticky in the center - sauce tastes like thousand island dressing - sort of odd.   Fried Green Tomatoes with corn relish type stuff - and it was delicious! Sweet potato mash also yummy. Biscuits tasted like KFC's - def not like a true southern fluffy one such as say from The Loveless Cafe or Jacks BBQ...  Late Night fried chicken with bacon Mac n Cheese - good white meat - the dark meat piece was fried to a crisp and had hardly any meat.  Would prefer an all white meat option.  Mac N Cheese was delish however had no bacon crumbles (on top) or green onions at all like most pictures on here show...so an afterthought let down. Hubby ordered the low country boil - shrimp and crab claw were done perfectly.    I can say it was good - however I do not think I would return - the menu is limited to where I ordered what I had wanted and tasted any other things on had thought I might try."}
{"text":"We live in Ohio City and walk to Soho.  We are also from the south.  The quality of the food is very good.  The menu is limited.  Service is always good.  I always get the steak and fries.  Not great but for middle priced steak good for me. My wife gets the chicken.  Give it a try.  I rate it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Chicken so good make you want to slap someone's mama. I'm not slapping my mom. Pollo Frito was excellent I give it 3 thumbs up. The Kitchen Brew cocktail was ok but who doesn't like coffee and hot whiskey right??? I'm actually hungry again writing this for their brunch"}
{"text":"My favorite place ever for brunch. I recommend them to all the out-of-towners I run into! The atmosphere is accommodating for everyone and I have never received poor service. The food comes out in a timely manner and the cocktails will blow you away! Great in the summer for an outside spot to eat and people watch."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Soho and I was very impressed. The atmosphere was elegant but didn't feel stuffy and uncomfortable. The waitress was extremely nice and very attentive. The appetizers were amazing. My group got the hush puppies, the devil eggs (fancy and traditional), a watermelon salad, and chips with pimento cheese. Absolutely delicious. The biscuits with the spread were good too! I also ordered food (late night chicken). The chicken was delicious. I don't think I've ever had a better piece of fried chicken breast. The Mac and cheese is so good! I also had mash potatoes and had no complaints at all. I absolutely recommend anyone to go here and I will definitely be back :)."}
{"text":"It was an impromptu visit that turned into a wonderful surprise. There is definitely some kind of mojo in their batter that makes the fried chicken perfect. The collard greens were also so delicious. Yum!"}
{"text":"Saturday night date night with the better half --  Highlights -  The Pecan Pie with bourbon ice cream was mind blowing.  I've tried to recall my previous Pecan Pie experiences in life, but I do not recall a particularly memorable pecan pie experience.  By default, this makes my Pecan Pie experience at Soho the best ever.  Really excellent Pecan Pie and the bourbon ice cream.  Absolutely must try.  The Jalepeno Hush Puppies were very tasty, as well as the Oysters Rockefeller.  Great beer selection and interesting cocktail menu.  The Kentucky Bourbon Beer is interesting and very nice.  We will be back.  Did I mention the Pecan Pie?  Just trust a strangers advice on yelp, you won't be disappointed. ;-)"}
{"text":"Soho has always impressed me. Brunch is great, and so is dinner. It tends to be pretty pricey for dinner on any other day than Wednesday, which is their \"chicken pickin\" night where their homemade sides and fried chicken cost a few bucks a piece.   The atmosohere is slightly rustic but swanky enough for a romantic dinner.   They also have Charleston Chews as \"after dinner mints\" at the door. Just so cute."}
{"text":"Visited Soho once for dinner awhile back but this was my first time going for brunch. We arrived around 11:30, which is early for brunch time, and were seated immediately. We ordered two breakfast cocktails that I cannot remember the names of. Mine was tequila (I know it's breakfast) and citrus juices and was very tasty. My boyfriend got some whiskey and coffee concoction which he said was delicious albeit pretty strong. Before your meal arrives they bring out warm biscuits with Apple butter and Rosemary butter, which I think is a thoughtful, homey touch. For our meals we ordered the breakfast skillet and the chicken and waffles and both were great. The house hot sauce they put on the table was a great addition to my skillet, spicy and tangy, but not overly hot. We also got a side of the bacon, which was four large thick cut and glazed pieces of deliciousness. Overall, a great meal. There's a lot of brunch competition in Ohio City with many great contenders, but I will definitely come back to Soho again!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3.5 stars for our first try. We got a gift certificate from our landlord for Soho so we decided to try out their brunch. I will say that it has a pretty cool atmosphere and nice patio.  When you arrive, you get 4 complimentary biscuits with butter and jam. The biscuits were a little small and not soft. As for the dishes, I think they weren't bad...but I would say that if you're expecting authentic southern food, that's not what you'll find here. It wasn't mind blowing. The hubs got the chicken and waffles. We asked if it was bone in, and it's boneless. Overall, he liked the way they fried it. The bourbon sauce though was way too sugary, so he didn't put it on his dish.  I had the southern benedict. It had pretty good flavor. But, I do think it was overpriced for the size of the dish.  I would come back for appetizers or drinks at night, probably won't be back for brunch or dinner though."}
{"text":"Wow, this place really blew me away. I was in Cleveland for a bachelorette party this weekend,and we came here for dinner at 8 pm on a Saturday. We had a reservation, but the place wasn't too crowded. The restaurant called earlier in the day to confirm the reservation, and we requested to sit outside, which they were able to accommodate.   To drink I had the Oxford: Gin, Pimm's No. 1, cucumber, thyme syrup, lemon juice. I don't drink much gin, but this was great and refreshing on a hot night.   We had had a small snack around 5 pm, so no one was super hungry so we decided to share a bunch of small plates. What we ordered:   Biscuits and jelly- okay we didn't order these, but they're complimentary. I probably haven't had a biscuit in over a year and these did not disappoint. Loved the rosemary butter and strawberry rhubarb jelly it came with. If I'm being picky they could have been a tad more moist, but overall they were great.   Watermelon salad- I wish the watermelon was a little sweeter, but to be fair, it's not in season yet. Loved the touch of spice and all the flavors and textures going on.   Chopped salad- good, but nothing special. Felt good to eat some more veggies though.  Hush puppies- I only got half of one, but I again loved the spice and the sauces they came with.   Pimento cheese spread- Pimento cheese/cheese in general is definitely NOT my go to, but I enjoyed this although mainly for the chips. This was the last dish that came, which was a little strange, so I was pretty full, which may have contributed to my lack of enthusiasm for the dish.   Macaroni and cheese- LOVED! I love mac and cheese though, but the toasted pecans on top added a great flavor and crunch. Mac and cheese was a creamy style, which is my favorite.   Short rib hash- I love me some short ribs, and these had a great flavor. It was hard to save enough for the other girls. Anything with potatoes and horseradish are good with me.   Fried green tomatoes- Star of the show!!! I was very indifferent to ordering these, but they ended up being a group favorite. The toppings took these to another level. Wish I had a whole dish of these to myself.   We were too stuffed for dessert, but I was creeping on other tables and they looked great.   Our waitress was very friendly and did a great job managing our large group. We took a Lyft there, so I can't speak to parking, but we were in the area earlier in the day and parking did not seem to be an issue.   I also have to mention the value of this place. We split the bill between 8 of us and it was only $23 including tip! Compared to jacked up LA prices, this place was a steal! Overall we had a great experience and I'd gladly go back whenever I'm in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Lots of great vegetarian and some vegan options in wonderfully strange combinations. Get the dried green tomatoes, the smoked mozzarella and biscuits and you're set. The glazed tofu was tasty but didn't add up to a satisfying entree. The service was friendly."}
{"text":"The only good thing I liked about SOHO was the 3 dollar select beer and this chatty girl who was sitting at the bar.The pulled pork lacked flavor and the chips tasted stale.I gave half my meal to the chatty girl and just listened to her ramble about Barack Obama.I will say if you want southern food you must venture to the eastside of Cleveland to place like Kims Wings and other small joints."}
{"text":"The food here is great!  I wanted everything on the menu!  I chose the bird on a bun and it was exactly as I imagined it would be.  My husband had the sunrise - also very good.  As an added bonus - they have dairy free options.  The drinks are excellent too!    The only way this place could improve on was the service.  There was little wait on a Friday night, which was nice, but the server was slow and not engaging at all.  She was not very friendly and had to be flagged down to order.  Maybe it was just an off night for her. . . . . . . ."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere as a backdrop to delicious well-priced comfort food and drinks offered up by an efficient hard-working friendly staff. Parking Is easy out back - and it is located adjacent to a bunch of other hip food and drink venues on 25th St. and a quick jump to downtown."}
{"text":"A quaint restaurant with amazing food! I came here with a big party of 15, and we were able to be seated together. The menu is fairly limited, which I think is great because it eases the decision-making process! The complimentary biscuits are pretty bomb. Don't be ashamed to ask for some extra ones!   I ordered the Shrimp and Gritz. The shrimps were freakin ginormous! Like seriously the biggest shrimps I've ever laid eyes on. They were super succulent and flavorful too! The gritz were seasoned nicely with a subtle cheesy flavor. I definitely recommend this dish! I tried a spoonful of my friend's yogurt, and it was awesome! It was more of a \"healthier\" ice cream than yogurt. The sweetness was matched well with the granola and other toppings.   I'm looking forward to dining here again soon!"}
{"text":"Cleveland is lacking in the soul food department but SOHO more than makes up for it with their modern southern food.   Who wouldn't be happy to start a meal with perfect biscuits, butter and a bit of jam? The biscuits are perfect- better than my own.   If you have a hankering for fried chicken, SOHO is the place. I can't think of another place in Cleveland that makes fried chicken in this league. It's always super crisp outside and tender and juicy inside and the mashed potatoes are just right.   SOHO always has at least one thoughtful vegetarian option on the menu. If that offering happens to be dumplings in any form, opt for it whether or not you're a vegetarian.  I've saved my most favorite thing for last, the Pimento Cheese Spread. I am crazy for Pimento Cheese Spread, I've met very few I've not liked. That said, SOHO's Pimento Cheese Spread is THE BEST PIMENTO CHEESE SPREAD IN THE WORLD. They serve it with fresh, house-made chips which are also perfect though I'm fond of putting the cheese spread on a biscuit.   Oh, I almost forgot, they've got a great cocktail list and every one I've tried has been well made and well balanced.   SOHO is a Cleveland gem."}
{"text":"came for happy hour with a buddy. beers on tap are always a plus. got a bunch of the appetizers and split one of the chicken entree. fried rice was meh. the complimentary bread and jam was on point! the pimento cheese dip was delicious"}
{"text":"My friend Emmalyn and I got there right in the nick of time for Sunday brunch.  (They close at 2:00 and we got there around 1:40.)  One major drawback: It was very LOUD.  I couldn't hear myself think.  Emmalyn had the biscuits and gravy.  I had eggs benedict with fried green tomato, prosciutto,  and Tabasco hollandaise   It was pretty yummy.  The prices were a little high, however.  The service was fantastic.  I really enjoyed the friendly and welcoming attitude of our server.  She was busy, but she gave us plenty of attention. She was the perfect definition of SOuthern HOspitality.   I like southern cooking, and although I didn't try the grits, they seem to have a good handle on this type of cuisine.  I'd like to go back for their lunch or dinner menu.  A nice added touch: they have \"Charleston Chews\" at the door as you leave."}
{"text":"It's a great location - with free parking in the west side market lot. And a cozy atmosphere. The free biscuits with butter and jam as the started are so good. The shrimp and grits is amazing. Some of the dishes could be better though. Like the fish and chips. It's not bad, just not awesome. They used to have a drink that included Pimm's and a sprig of rosemary. I can't remember what it was called. But the most recent trip it wasn't on the menu any more. I asked about it but the server didn't know what I was talking about. Anyhow, bring that drink back Soho!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere for a snowy Saturday lunch.    Thumbs up on the extremely rich mac-n-cheese.  My tablemates adored the jalapena hushpuppies(not a big hush puppy fan, so it wouldn't be fair for me to judge).    Po' boy fish sandwich needs some help.   The fish was lost -- either a 2nd piece of fish or a different sort of bun.  Very tasty fish/batter once deconstructed..  Tablemates enjoyed their lunches.  I was told the chix-n-waffles were as good as Southsides, but with a different spin.  Additional bonus was the fried chicken was boneless.   Wicked good syrup.  EXCELLENT service.  I look forward to my next visit.  I hope to hit the Wednesday nght special.  I hope to explore the entire clever drink list too!"}
{"text":"Out of towners, here on business and looking for a nice non-pretentious place we found it in Ohio City.    Six of us have been here all week and have been to a bunch of spots on E 4th and in the Warehouse district.  Well tonight we wanted something different and found it here at SOHO.    A comfortable spot with a good menu and executed very well.  We shared four appetizers;  Fried Green Tomatoes, Scallops, The Pimento Cheese with BBQ Chips and The Johnny Cakes.  All were very good but the Fried Green Tomatoes were superb.   Probably would do without the Scallops next time.     Dinner selections included Shrimp and Grits, Fish and Chips, A Ribeye and I had the Fried Chicken with Mashed.    The folks who had the Shrimp cleaned their plates and I am not sure they left any porcelain on the bowl.   The two that had the Fish were not that thrilled with the batter but the fish was tasty.   The Ribeye was nice with a Sweet Potato mash.   I was surprised to see two Fried Boneless Breasts with Gravy, Mashed Potato and Collards.  All were delish.  The Collards had that smoky flavor and the spice to kick it up a notch.     We finished with sharing of a slice of Pecan Pie and an order of Beignets.   Just wonderful....... We all had a lovely meal and will be back the next time we hit Cleveland.   I think the atmosphere really made the difference.   Reasonably priced and portions were so much better than one particular spot on E 4th that I found to be so in love with Pork and Duck fat that they have to charge huge amounts of cash for little tiny portions.  Just as a comparison we had the same sized crowd and spent half as much and had twice the experience."}
{"text":"I like to think I'm a southern girl at heart, and coming to this restaurant makes me feel that southern comfort in snowy Cleveland.  From the exposed brick wall to the mason jars filled with black eyed peas and votive candles on the table, SoHo definitely looked the part.  I had the Coral Cables drink which was fruity and fun (tequila, passion fruit, orange juice.. How could you go wrong?!). While we waited for our meals to arrive, we were served the thickest, most delicious biscuits I have ever eaten. They were accompanied by herb butter and apple jelly which added even more happiness to my palate.  For my entree I got the \"late night\" fried chicken.  It had a nice crispy breading that had a ton of flavor, and the barbecue sauce was a nice addition. I really enjoyed the Mac and cheese that accompanied the chicken... It was rich and creamy and had a nice crunch from the bacon bits.  For dessert, we split the beignets which were incredible! They were hot and coated with cinnamon and sugar with a lovely sauce to be drizzled over top.  Perfect ending to this lovely meal!"}
{"text":"A fun evening at Soho. Ally our waitress took excellent care of us.   Love the drinks. Followed by some biscuits with a homemade jam. For appetizers it was fried green tomatoes nice sauce.   Three had chicken- Sally had the chicken meatballs all very taste.   Fun place on West 25th street."}
{"text":"In Cleveland for a few days and wanted to hit a hot spot! This spot looked pretty good so hubby and I decided to check it out. You're started out with two delicious biscuits !!!! They come with a jelly and a rosemary butter.... both to die for (almost better than the meal) . We both had chicken and waffles which were good also! Great atmosphere and set up and the staff were all very friendly and professional! Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for Sunday brunch and it was very good! I got the special- battered chicken drumsticks and cornbread French toast with jalape√±o butter and candied cherries... a great mix of sweet and savory but the chicken drumsticks were somewhat difficult to eat and the breading fell right off. my husband got the biscuits and gravy with eggs which was very good, on the sweeter side for biscuits and gravy, creamy but not too heavy- came with side of spinach which was a bit too sweet and could have been a better contrast.   Drinks: both got the stuck pig w beef jerky straw with a pickled okra and it was delicious- only comment is that it could have been spicier.  It came out to be a bit more expensive than expected, but was overall an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food.  The meatball appetizers are  especially good.  We were there early so they werent too busy yet.  Nice ambiance and plenty of parking in back."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were craving good fried chicken and decided to try this place. We went during happy hour (didn't know it was that time) and so glad we did. I have to say while others charge full price for their watered down drinks, this place did not skimp on their drink specials. We got braised braised beef over mashed potatoes with veggies and this was phenomenal. We each of the chicken dinners. I got the late night dinner and Mac and cheese was so good. Chicken was moist and crispy. Hubby felt chicken could have used more seasoning but I thought it was perfect. We come from drab Parma to Ohio City because we love the vibe. The place is really aesthetically pleasing too. We are coming back and recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"In the mood for brunch we decided to check out Soho Chicken and Whiskey. This is a really nice cozy restaurant that specializes in southern fair. They have a great menu, full bar and great southern hospitality. They have small dining room, seating at the bar and a nice patio outside.  After being seating and reviewing the menu they brought us complimentary  biscuits with raspberry jam and rosemary butter. The biscuits were light, fluffy and the jam and butter were a nice compliment. After devouring them we decided to order.   Items ordered:  Avocado Toast (soft boiled egg, smoked trout remulade, pickled red onion and multigrain toast). First time having avocado toast and I have to say we are a fan. The creaminess of the avocado on the nice crunchy toast and the smoked trout and runny egg, amazing flavors.  Shrimp & Grits (butter poached prawns, andouille sausage, asparagus and cheesy grits). We were not to fond of this dish. The grits were really watery and the prawns seemed rubbery and overcooked. The whole dish just seemed under seasoned.  Chicken & Waffles (southern fried chicken, rosemary waffles and ohio maple syrup). The chicken was seasoned and  cooked perfectly the waffles were crispy with a soft center. Great dish!   Bourbon Glazed Bacon. Bacon and bourbon = perfection!   Deviled eggs. Great presentation, egg was cooked wonderfully and the whipped yolks were fantastic. Over all great experience will definetly return to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Delicious! The Mustard-and-Pretzel Fried Chicken special was excellent! The chicken was super crispy on the outside and super juicy and tender on the inside. And you could definitely taste that their oil was clean! We also got a side of their Mac n Cheese and it too was really great.   Make sure you make a reservation or come early in the evening however; we almost didn't get in because the place is fairly small and fills up quickly (luckily we got the last table!)."}
{"text":"Amazing place!!! They catered to my dietary needs!! Phenomenal food and a great staff. I will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"My fellow yelpers and future yelpers - this place isn't all that bad. There were a group of 6 of us and I made reservations at 7:30. Place was fairly filled with patrons and plenty of servers. Attentive service but it would've been great if the servers knew where the food goes where. So that part is true. A bit annoying after a few times. The person who took our orders weren't the one who gave us the food so maybe she got busy?   When I first walked in, the place had candlelight on each of their tables so good place to bring that special someone in a date. Bar is in the back and patio is outside. Contemporary furniture - Southern style. Like!   Drinks 5 out of 5 The Charleston -  lots of gin and barely there watermelon juice = strong  New Orleans - another strong drink my friend Teri had. It definitely lives up to its name.  Beer selection - plenty to choose from ales, Belgium, dark beers. They got wine too.   Food - 4 out of 5.  Biscuits were small but their starters and entrees were delicious.  Starters 1) Crawfish Fritters - plenty of crawfish in each fritter and the sauces that came with added an oomph. Highly recommended.  2) Jalape√±o Hush Puppies - not as spicy hot as you may think considering it has jalape√±os. If you had hush puppies, they're like breaded round bites of goodness and this was okay. I thought I'd get a kick in the mouth after taking a bite but nope, no effect of that. I was a tad disappointed but it was still good.  3) BBQ chips w/cheddar spread \"that looks like Spanish rice\" (I forgot what's it called) - delicious and lots of flavor spread and plenty of chips.   Entrees or Main Dinner 1) Catfish Po Boy - these sandwiches were humongous. My friends got them and from what they told me \"omg its sooo good\"  2) Wild Mahi - (my dish) there were I believe 4 pieces of Mahi grilled and cooked perfect. The outside has that chargrilled look but the fish was just right. I think it would've been great if they gave me some lemon wedges so I could spritz on my fish but it was okay. The cauliflower salsa medley with aioli sauce incorporated that dish wholly. Not sure about the bacon, i didn't think it added any purpose. In my opinion, it was chewy and salty. just the Mahi and the medley would've been fine.  3) Chicken and waffles - looks different than Southside. There were I believe 3 or 4 breaded chicken and then small sweet potatoe waffles cakes.  4) shrimp and grits - big jumbo shrimp and tasty grits according to my friend Teri. :)   Overall 4 out of 5. I'd come again."}
{"text":"Ordered the southern Benedict here the other day and it was amazing, they have the best hollandaise sauce I've ever had if I'm being honest. I also ordered a gentleman's breakfast mixed drink which was unbelievably strong I was practically drunk off just one drink but it didn't taste strong, it had a pungent undertone of whiskey but was well mixed and masked with apple flavors. Delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"On a nice day, their non-smoking patio can't be beat! Great for brunch. We went here after running the Cleveland 10K, and definitely appreciated the hearty meal. I can recommend the shrimp and grits, and although the biscuits and gravy were also good, I probably wouldn't get them again since the appetizer includes biscuits. They also have an enticing mixed drink menu, a nice beer and wine list, and pecan pie for dessert."}
{"text":"I think this might be my favourite restaurant in Cleveland! I came here for a friend's birthday and had a blast. The ambiance is very cool and cozy.   While we were waiting for our dinners we were served hot, buttery biscuits...just amazing. For my entree I ordered the sweet potato dumplings with a side of jalapeno poppers...I also stole a spoonful of my friend's shrimp and grits...everything was DELICIOUS. It's been a while since I've had a really tasty and exciting meal in Cleveland.   I will say..it was pretty pricey for what you got...but I enjoyed everything so much I didn't really care! This is definitely not a place to go if you're watching your waistline...be prepared to indulge!  An awesome find in Ohio City! Perfect for a night out!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend of a friend and boy was it a great choice! Great service that helped recommend beers and food came pretty quickly! Got the chicken and waffles and was very pleased! Not too greasy and boneless chicken with savory waffles. So much love. Not to mention they give a free biscuit before the meal with rhubarb jam and flavored butter omggg would totes come back if I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Soho is an adorable lil eatery! We decided to try them out for brunch and were pleasantly surprised. I was able to make a reservation over the phone and only waited a few minutes when we arrived. It's a small place but is set up nicely with a cute Bar. The mimosas are delicious and averagely priced. I order the shrimp and grits and my gf got the chicken and waffles. Complimentary biscuits with rosemary butter and apple butter almost filled me up! They are soooo good. Our server was nice and speedy. Our water glasses were always full and she refilled my coffee without asking. The wait for our food was a little Long but you didn't notice with the constant refills and biscuits! The food was absolutely delicious and filling. The ONLY Downside is the large loud party sitting behind us. With it being a smaller place the laughs of the jolly party were overbearing. Other patrons were visibly annoyed but no one asked them to quiet down. I would definitely come back here! Great decor, great service. Next time I'll just ask for a booth away from the hooligans. Lol"}
{"text":"SOHO was the best part of Cleveland. I recommend it to anyone travelling there, and if I get a chance, I will definitely go back.  I waited too long to review so I don't remember as much as I'd like, but what I do remember is that everything - every single thing - we ordered was amazing. The biscuits and butter before our good, the peach soda I got with my food, the chicken, and the sides - it was all delectable. I don't really anticipate going to Cleveland every again, but I hope I do just so I can eat at SOHO again!"}
{"text":"This is a really consistent restaurant. We've been coming here almost since they opened and each visit has been nothing but enjoyable. The menu changes often, so there is always something new. Regardless, some things never disappear like the various Chicken dinners and the Shrimp&grits.  SOHO serves southern fare. Dishes have plenty of spark, but not to a level that deadens taste buds. Prices here are more than fair. The atmosphere is pleasant and one that promotes relaxation. In the hustle that is W25th, SOHO is a comfortable southern oasis. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love SOHO Chicken + Whiskey! It is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland.  The chicken is the best that I have ever had, and there are so many different sides that you can get with it.  Although there aren't a ton of options for vegetarians, chicken is in the name of the restaurant, so it should be expected.  The place can is a little small and get pretty busy, but it is well worth the wait.  You are also able to make reservations, and the staff is always extremely accommodating."}
{"text":"SOHO is pretty easy to walk past on the way to the many bars on W 25th, and I've talked with several natives who weren't aware of its existence at all. The interior is chic - after all, we're in Ohio City. Chic, but still family-friendly. Somehow they get away with sultry lighting and tattooed waitresses serving cocktails while younger kids dig delightedly into Hush Puppies. Favorite seating is in a booth, below the cool-looking lamps.   I arrived ready for some tummy-satisfying fried chicken, but was unprepared for how delicious their Homemade Biscuits w/ Rosemary Butter and Jam were. I was immediately suspicious since something that tasty couldn't possibly be free.   My friends and I got three different Fried Chicken Dinners that reflected our palettes pretty well. If you're a sucker for Mac n' Cheese, go for the Late Night Style. Brunch-a-holic? Mornin' Style is for you. Gotta have your veggies? Nooner is your jam. I've been craving chicken and waffles, so obviously I went with the Mornin' Style - and was not disappointed by the sweet and savory Rosemary waffles. It was a little much after the biscuits though, and I would have enjoyed a side salad to balance out the carbs + protein. All the fried chicken is lightly crisped and tender, as well as BONELESS, so you can actually attempt to use a fork and knife! The fried coating is less greasy than at Hot Sauce Williams and not as hard as KFC, which was much preferred for me.   Their menu actually isn't as extensive as I expected it to be, and if you're hunting for some more traditional Southern/Creole dishes you might have to head to Bourbon Street Barrel Room, which will also give you more bang for your buck. Flavor wise though, I can't complain and am glad to have somewhere consistent to put my faith (and money) into."}
{"text":"great food, fantastic service. chicken and waffles is life changing!"}
{"text":"Had Brunch here with a group of friends and it was outstanding. Both the service and food were exceptional- my BF and I had the shrimp and grits and everything was delicious. Everyone in our party felt the same way. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is a long narrow dining room inside with a patio next to Mitchell's ice cream shop. Menu is a modern upscale take on Southern food and my gin fizz was fantastic. Just what I wanted to go with my big plate of Chicken-Fried Pork Salad. And what a brunch salad it is -  three beautiful deviled eggs on the side, plentiful fresh greens tossed with tomato and avocado, and a crunchy juicy pork cutlet underneath everything. Om nom nom. Brunch also came with perfect complimentary biscuits served with fruit compote and rosemary butter. After you stuff yourself, you get to walk it off browsing the discount book store on the same street."}
{"text":"Great Brunch spot. Sit outside and enjoy southern Americana flavors. Love the speciality sodas and fabulous house made hot sauce."}
{"text":"The only question I have about this place is why I waited so long to try it! I cannot even believe such tasty food has been within a 5 mile radius of where I live and that I never even knew what I was missing. You definitely want to make a reservation if you plan on going on a weekend, we saw many people trying to come in without one and leave because there was a 45 minute wait. The space itself is not that big, but it is soo cozy and adorable in there.   Instead of bread, they bring biscuits to your table (with jam and butter) that melt in your mouth!!! I could have came for the biscuits alone but forced myself to save room. Next, we ordered the poutine which was phenomenal. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the gravy. In my opinion, their gravy is a tad on the sweet side and I would prefer it to be a little more savory and thick-- my ONLY complaint. After basically licking the plate clean, my entree arrived. HOLY COW. I ordered the \"late night\" with fried chicken and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was nothing I can even put into words. It was made with penne and bacon bits and the creamiest, yummiest cheese that could ever happen to mac and cheese. It was like crack to me. And the chicken ... so succulent and juicy with the most perfect breading. Quite possible the best fried chicken I have ever had. I will now for days to come dream about SoHo!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  I had the cheese grits and shrimp.  The biscuts they bring out first will make me go back over and over.  Great service.  So many great choices on the menu. A great find!"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday. It was pick yer (not a typo)  chicken and sides. Had a party of five. Everyone seemed happy with their selections. Spicy is spicy. Overall, chicken was very good. Loved the hush puppies. Service was very attentive. Overall, a very good experience."}
{"text":"I went shortly after this place opened after seeing all the rave Yelp reviews. And I all I can say is holy crap what a disappointment! I wanted to keep it light so I got Fried Green Tomaters and Oysters Rockefeller - they were both just OK. I did enjoy the cheese curd with the tomaters but the oysters were overpowered by the watercress - couldn't taste much of anything else. I made the mistake of getting the Corpus Christi which was seriously the worst cocktail I have ever had in my life. You have to seriously love pickles to appreciate this drink and I thought I did but apparently  I don't. The drink was supposed to be a twist on blood mary.... HATED IT! But not one to abuse alcohol I can't believe I drank the whole thing. ICK! Just thinking about it. My friend had the sweet potato bisque which she really enjoyed. I tried hers; it definitely was the highlight in an otherwise lackluster meal. She also had the chicken and waffles which at $17 a dinner is more expensive than most other places in town. Eventually I will give them another chance perhaps for happy hour. But I was definitely disappointed with my first visit."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! Thus far, my favorite brunch spot in Cleveland, and I've been to quite a few. The complimentary biscuit, butter, and jam is so good I would eat a meal of simply Soho biscuits if it were an option. My girlfriend and I split the the hush pups and gravy, the deviled eggs, and the shrimp and grits...all of which were fantastic. The hush pups and gravy is a delicious take on the classic dish and I would highly recommend it. The serving sizes are big, which is the only way to do brunch in my opinion. Great, friendly service to add."}
{"text":"Place is a well oiled machine. Amazing food, amazing drinks, and amazing staff. Favorite place to go, and also an amazing place to take out of towers. Don't be stupid and go try the Bird on a Bun and have some bourbon. It's normal..."}
{"text":"Just updating to say they keep getting better at the great things they do.    SoHo is adds something new to Ohio City dining options - and it's a welcome addition. We went with a friend before seeing a show at Playhouse Square - so we arrived around 6:30 and were easily in and out for our 8:30 show time.  The hostess asked if we ahead reservations - since we didn't we were seated at a high top in the bar area. Within 30 minutes the main dining space tables were FULL with those who'd reserved in advance.  Our friend had already visited, so we had some insights ... Main insight: Desserts are small (we passed, but did see some and they are petite sized).  The biscuits with butter and preserves were a nice WELCOME - and rather than losing the bottom half of mine to my husband, our server brought more when she saw my biscuit dodging his grasping hand.   I had the chicken & waffles - a dish that is different everywhere you go. Our friend was afraid the portion was too small - I assured him that the waffles & coating were so rich, the portion size was perfect. It was crispy outside, with wonderful dense flavors. For some people, the sweet potato waffle might seem dry, but it's a savory accompaniment to the chicken, and is great with the warm bourbon maple syrup.  Our friend said the shrimp & grits were divine and my husband really enjoyed the catfish po'boy. He loves a good BBQ potato chip, so he really liked the crunchy chips at SoHo.  From where we we seated, I had a great view of the electric atmosphere in the dining room - a great mix of patrons enjoying a night out. I also watched the bar tender carefully crafting drink after drink. I'll be back and try out some of their signature cocktails. If they reflect his attention to the details, they should be fabulous!  The only gripe I have is that the shape of the serving plates makes it impossible to rest a knife on the 'side' of your plate. Not sure where I'm supposed to put it between uses.   I'll deal with random utensil management issues since SoHo will definitely be part of our dining rotation in Ohio City."}
{"text":"We tried to get in at Townhall for brunch on a Saturday and the wait was crazy long so we walked down the street and found ourselves at Soho. We were seated right away and there was plenty of room to spread out (highly preferable to rubbing elbows with other guests like other places in the area). The service was very attentive and professional. The waitress brought over biscuits right away with some sort of delicious butter.  We ordered Beignets, the Southern Benedict, and the Chicken Fried Pork Salad with deviled eggs. Also a side bourbon glazed bacon. Wow. Everything was delicious. The menu is a bit on the heavier side so don't expect to come here for any light fare. For all the food we had we were also shocked at how reasonable our bill was. Do yourself a favor and check out their brunch!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for brunch, but I did really enjoy it! I got the shakshuka, which was unique and fun for a brunch menu. Mimosas were good and the the service was great, as well. I definitely want to come back to try their chicken! I would recommend."}
{"text":"Good gracious this place is wonderful.  Nice atmosphere, some creative cocktails (almost all involving whiskey), and the best steak and eggs in town!  Chicken and waffles are phenomenal as well.  Try the gentleman's breakfast for your cocktail, just don't have 4 like I did last time as you will be stumbling out.  Tad bit on the pricey side is my only negative."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy, chicken and waffles, jalape√±o hush puppies.... Delicious!  Great service and nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and even better service.  My husband and I showed up around 6 on a Friday night. They had no tables available but we happily waited for seats at the bar.  The bartender was immediately there to get out drinks. Between the two of us we ordered three of their signature cocktails. All were good.  We had deviled eggs as an appetizer and they were great. They also brought us each a biscuit with some jam and butter. The jam was awesome.  I ordered the Late night. A chicken breast, mac and cheese and collard greens. The chicken breast was very big and juicy. Collard greens were great and the max and cheese was pretty good.  My husband ordered the Mornin'. Chicken thigh was juicy and the breaded was crunchy. You could taste the rosemary in the waffle it was wonderful.   The staff was entertaining without trying to be. You get the idea that they actually enjoy working together.  We will definitely be back at some point."}
{"text":"We have brought out of town friends here on multiple occasions because this is how we like to show off Cleveland - great atmosphere and delicious food. Always our first choice when going to W. 25th and there are A LOT of other options down there. Love the vibe of the place, have always had friendly service and the food is yummy."}
{"text":"A great menu full of low-country favorites, a friendly staff and a warm and inviting space all come together to make SOHO one of Cleveland's true culinary gems. We paid them a visit on a Saturday evening, 6ish and our timing was perfect. The entire bar was empty as were most of the tables. Just how we like it. We bellied up to the bar and were immediately greeted with a pair of menus, some waters and a smile. So far so good.   The decor is a well-designed combo of urban mechanics and southern hospitality. Light woods intermingled with stone complimented by a really cool metal cut-out silhouette of the Cleveland skyline on the back wall. The front windows also do a great job of illuminating what would otherwise be a pretty tiny dark spot.  The libations are a concise melange of whisky tinged cocktails and American craft ales that has something for just about everyone. While not a massive beer selection (there are plenty of spots down the street if that's what you're looking for), I did manage to find a new beer to try, Abita's Spring IPA, a wonderfully hoppy, sessionable rendition of one of my favorite styles. My wife went with one of their signature mixed drinks the name of which escapes me - something sweet, slightly fruity with plenty of bourbon. She described it as \"effective\".  The menu at SOHO is not for those looking to count calories. It's southern comfort food without apology. There was a reason that Paula Deen was over 200lbs at one point and the culprits are butter and frying, both of which are in great supply on their menu. Fried green tomatoes, fried catfish, fried chips, fried chicken, bourbon butter sauce, lobster butter...I'm sure you get the picture. Sure, there are a couple of salads at the top but if you aren't careful you'd probably run right past them on your way to the fried chicken with mac 'n cheese and sweet potato jojo fries. Here's how our meal went down:  House-made pimento cheese dip - I've never had pimento cheese before. It was like a combination of cream cheese and shredded cheddar. Tasty, sure, but way too thick for the super-thin chips to manage. A dip this hearty needs a vehicle with more junk in its trunk -  sourdough bread? Pita? Something. A word of warning on this one, it's spicy. Both the chips and the dip probably have cayenne pepper in them so if you are averse to heat stay away.  Ruby 'cado salad - Not a bad salad to kick things off. Fresh spinach, avocado, blood orange slices, goat cheese (ours was missing this ingredient, more on that in the service review), raw almonds and a sweet honey mustard vinaigrette. A spring salad if I've ever seen one.  Deviled eggs - Probably one of the biggest disappointments of the meal. They were good, don't get me wrong, but I can make these. They reminded me of what you'd get at a work pot luck bbq. There was nothing \"elevated\" or special about them and at $5.50 for three halved eggs I just wanted more.  Southern fried chicken, evenin' style - I got this version essentially by accident. There was a miscommunication between my wife and the bartender and voila, here's what I got. The bourbon gravy was stunning and I'm just not a big fan of collards, although these were cooked way down and quite tasty (spicy, too). The mashed potatoes were also perfect, velvety smooth and seasoned just right. The chicken was also pretty tasty, fried a wonderful golden brown it was juicy and well-seasoned. My biggest gripe would have to be with the batter. It just wouldn't stay on the chicken. As soon you I knifed it it crumbled off. I found myself having to eat the chicken and the breading separately. Not a huge deal just a bit of a PITA.  The service we had at the bar was wonderful. Our water glasses were always full and the follow-up was spot on. As I mentioned above, our salad was missing the goat cheese. We decided to mention it in passing to the bartender just as a heads-up for the kitchen and what did she do? She comped my wife's drink. Pure class. I only wish the other restaurants in the area would take some notes from the folks at SOHO. This is how it's done.  We had a really nice dinner experience at SOHO and we will definitely return. The food was all lovingly prepared and the support staff couldn't have been more pleasant. Sure, there were a couple of hiccups that knocked off a star, but those things happen. Well done guys. We'll see ya'll soon."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my boyfriend. I had the ribeye and he had the lowcountry boil. Both were delicious but the pecan pie with homemade icecream was the best! You should really order the desert :)"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a night that we were visiting Cleveland. It was Saturday night and we only called ahead less than 30 min beforehand. They were more than accommodating to seat us.   You get wonderfully fresh biscuits with both a jam or rosemary butter. We started off with the deviled eggs and hushpuppies. Both were great for sharing.   I got the El Paso. You can get either a chicken breast, thigh or both. It comes over a massive salad of fresh romaine, black beans, tomato, corn, and avocado dressing. The chicken was cooked perfect. Nice and crispy but super juicy.   My boyfriend got the bird in a bun. Amazing chicken sandwich, homemade pickles, just overall a great meal. Would come back anytime I'm in town.   Also - our waitress, Amber was wonderful."}
{"text":"Many years ago, there was this bakery called Lelolai that stood on the site where SOHO Kitchen & Bar is today. They served great Creme de caramel flan and empanadas at a steal and I mourned the day they closed their doors. I avoided whatever took its place in some form of protest. However, I regret it now. SOHO Kitchen & Bar is good eats and represents southern cuisine best via Creole with a twist.  I've had the biegnets at Cafe du Monde in New Orleans and have been jonesin' for them addictive bites for years since I last visited. If you are in the same boat, score! they serve it here! The only difference is that the original is drowned in confectioners sugar while this one has more restraint in that department (which I wish was not the case).  Shrimp on the shrimp and grits was large, plump and perfectly cooked. The grits were cheesy but not too cheesy. The addition of Andouille sausage provided good contrast. Tasty.  I'm so glad we have something other than Popeye's chicken to represent southern cooking in Cleveland."}
{"text":"All of the food here is amazing! Great happy hour prices and it's not too crowded to find a seat. Delicious brunch and the best fish fry around."}
{"text":"Brunch was amazing and Ally was fantastic! The rolls and jam were heaven. Definitely coming back when the patio is open."}
{"text":"The orange juice is fresh, biscuits are light and fluffy and the chicken and waffles were quite impressive. Well worth a visit for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE customer service. I had a party of 6 including a very pregnant friend. I received, \"Sorry we don't have a table that big.\"  What an awful answer, and terrible customer service. Would never waste my time there nor my money."}
{"text":"Food was good but didn't live up to the hype for me. The prices seem a little expensive. The breading kept falling off my chicken as I ate it and it seemed like my chicken was slightly undercooked. It was tough but not in a dry way. The mac and cheese and collard greens were delicious. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. They werevtestong out a patio whichvI enjoyed and appreciated. The inside is really nice as well. I will try this again but I've definitely had better and cheaper fried chicken."}
{"text":"After going to college in Alabama, I find myself craving the down home comfort food and let me tell you that Soho delivers. I have been here multiple times and have never been disappointed with my food selection. The chicken and waffles never let me down, and neither do the shrimp and grits. You should definitely try the fried green tomatoes too! It is also one of the very few places that carries Pappy Van Winkle! I definitely recommend trying this restaurant - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love restaurants that offer interesting, thoughtful vegetarian options. It's kind of a bummer when my dinner companions get to feast on a variety of choices and I'm relegated to the same, tired meatless standards (black bean burger anyone?)  There is no shortage of vegetarian awesomeness at SOHO. As I write this review, my tummy is happily full of spicy fried tofu, mashed potatoes with delicious veggie gravy, and deviled eggs that I wish would be heaped upon a giant silver tray and served to me at my whim.   I can also vouch for the fabulousness of the cheesy grits and the fried green tomatoes.   SOHO is one of the places I share with out-of-town guests when I want to show off my beloved city.   One more thing... SOHO, if you're reading this, would you consider adding some fat, succulent, garlicky Lima beans to your menu???"}
{"text":"Before you come: pay close attention to their hours and get there right before they open. Brunch started at 11 and by 11:15 the place was packed.   Great service and great food! We got the chicken and waffles (don't forget their small batch hot sauce!) and beignets (came with chocolate and raspberry sauce). The portion size on both were very good.   Also the meal began with free biscuits. There was rosemary butter and rhubarb jam to compliment them."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the decor was simple, but  appealing. The service was good. Menu limited. They have specialty sodas. I LOVED the rootbeer from Louisianna! We started off with fried green tomatoes ($9) w/ an okra remoulade. The sauce tasted like funky mayo. The tomatoes were nicely breaded, but not seasoned. We sent them back. Next, I had the server pick me a salad. She picked a grilled caesar ($8). The \"goddess dressing\" on their caesar was definitely not that of any goddess, lol. It was a warm soggy salad w/ toppings. Not much flavor. Sent that back. For an entree we both ordered the fried chicken late night style. You get 2 pieces of chic w/ pretty decent mac & cheese topped w/ bacon bits plus a side of their bbq sauce. The fried chicken was crispy and chicken was tender. You also get some delicious biscuits with your meal too."}
{"text":"Just can't stay away from Soho Kitchen. Made reservations for brassa, ended up at our new favorite place. Ty Soho Kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is always fantastic, the cocktails and beer list are unique and tasty, and the service is genuinely nice. Love it."}
{"text":"YUM, Do you want to get fat? Not eating enough calories in your diet? COME HERE!! The food is delicious and awful for you. The drinks are top notch and very sweet too! Brunch is a great time to go it's right in the middle of everything great going on downtown.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Great food, super friendly employees and a great vibe, we will be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Have returned many times because the whole experience has always been great. It's a cute little place that doesn't get super loud. Chicken and waffles either way are my absolute favorite."}
{"text":"Saying SOHO is my favorite restaurant is an understatement.  Ever since I came here for the first time a few years ago, I loved it.  The staff is GENUINELY kid, the food is amazing, the drinks are wonderful, and I love the setting & decor.  One thing--the booths are way, way too small.  They needed to just make three large booths instead of trying to cram in 4.  I'm sure this was a financial decision.  Other than that, I love this place dearly.  They are also one of the last restaurants in the area that actually takes reservations!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been back in a minute--but SOHO is still killin' it, I see (errr, taste.)   I met up here with my family this past Sunday for brunch and oh-my-white-peach-mimosa, it was delicious. Pair that with those damn biscuits (are you kidding me with those? There should be a part of the food pyramid dedicated to those things.) and the southern benedict, and you have yourselves a winner.   By the way, the southern benny is served on a fried green tomato. Holy crap, it's good."}
{"text":"Don't write too many reviews (yes, lazy) but was compelled to share what a great experience we had at brunch this morning. Relatively limited menu but the items we had really rocked. Complimentary biscuits to start and then I had S'UTHERN BENEDICT which consisted of perfectly poached eggs on top of fried green tomatoes and thin, prosciutto-like ham topped with an amazing tabasco hollandaise sauce. The potatoes/onions on the side were perfect as well. My teen girls enjoyed the chicken and waffles and cheddar biscuits and gravy and my wife loved the shrimp and grits. We also shared an order of beignets that came with a tasty coffee/caramel dipping sauce.  Very friendly, attentive wait staff and great atmosphere. All around great experience and I'm looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"The food here has been really good the few times I went. The menu is really specialized, so there's not an overwhelming amount of options but everything I've ordered has been delicious. I especially enjoy the biscuits which get served with rosemary butter. Cocktails are very good. Overall I feel like it's a bit pricey for the portion sizes, but still very good. It's a bummer they don't open until 11 on the weekends. Fills up quick so make reservations if you can."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!  We started off with some hush puppies and cocktails. Their hush puppies are so good and the cocktails are strong!!  Next they brought out biscuits and jam.  Our waitress was awesome and was able to sub out meat in my meal with avocado.    We will be having many more bunches there!! Also make a reservation they fill up quick!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly overwhelming. Meaning the food. I got the fried green tomato BLT, since I felt like being safe. But I really couldn't finish it because of how salty it was. Ick.   The service was nice enough, so kudos to the pretty lady that took our order.   But it was way too expensive for what I got, and still left hungry because I couldn't stomach it.  However, I did come across a brunch menu that seemed worth coming back for. Maybe I am just not cut out for southern style food."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is nice. They had good biscuits and Mac cheese. The jalape√±o hush puppies were disappointing. They didn't have any jalape√±o taste to them and we're basically fried ball of dough. For the main courses I got the dinner fried chicken. The crust was really salty which I tried to cover up by taking bites with of mashed potatoes and gravy. Overall the food was just okay, nothing special."}
{"text":"Just went there for Sunday brunch and was very impressed.  They allowed my dog to sit on the patio....but they went above and beyond what most places do when they allow dogs on their patios.  They brought out treats, actually interacted with him and offered a water bowl.  That scores major points with me right there.  Then the food came out.....wow.  I had the ambrosia salad and a side of cheesy grits.......soooo freaking good.  The ambrosia salad was not your grandma's ambrosia.....it was a buttermilk panna cotte and I could have ate a gallon of it.  The cheesy grits had the perfect texture and they give you a generous helping.  Will definitely be returning there.  Bonus....through August and September, 10% of proceeds during Friday & Saturday lunch and Sunday brunch are donated to the Cleveland Kennel."}
{"text":"Two friends and I went here on a weekend looking for some friend chicken an we were not disappointed! We each got a different chicken plate (Morning Style, Evening Style, Late-Night Style) and each of us loved what we got. Mine was the Evening Style with mashed potatoes, stewed collards, country gravy, and it was delicious! The skin crispy and the meat juicy. We also split a side of Jalapeno Hush Puppies and I thought they were so good and well paired with that spicy mayo like sauce.   On my first visit here I thought the biscuits were dry and not that good, but my second time around they were nice and tasty especially with the accompanying butter and apple butter (I think it was apple butter?)."}
{"text":"I have ate at Soho several times and each time it has been amazing. I love their cocktails, appetizers/salads and the entrees."}
{"text":"My fiance and I live in Baton Rouge, the southern food capital of the country. Rarely can you get out of the south and find good southern comfort food. This place was delicious. There biscuits are amazing. We ordered the chicken & waffles, beignets & hush pups and gravy. Everything was to die for. The beignets are not the traditional kind from home but still very good. Everyone was friendly and kind as well. Will return!"}
{"text":"In town for just two days visiting the R&R Hall of Fame & The Christmas Story House, SOHO was a very pleasant surprise for dinner.  Great vibe, relaxed atmosphere, and really good food. Chicken 'n Waffles...a must! An extensive beer list, easy parking in the big lot in the rear, and attentive service. What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Soho for a while, but finally got the chance to try it.   WOW.   We came in before the Lady Gaga Concert to enjoy happy hour. I'm  not even sure where to start, as I was so over joyed by everything. The happy hour is fabulous! Everything is $5 or less and from what they told us, ever changing. They had a handful of food, a few cocktails, a few beers, and a couple wines listed on it. I ordered from the regular menu, a cocktail made with bourbon barrel aged Gin (a person favorite spirit) and my friend did their manhattan.   To snack on, we went with the deviled eggs and the sausage gravy smothered hush puppies. They were so delicious! Great size for sharing and the flavors were beautiful. The bartender was friendly and attentive. There was another gentleman behind the bar, that was also great.   The rest of the group showed up and we moved to a table next to the bar. We ordered a variety of chicken pieces, more eggs, Mac and cheese, and fried green tomatoes. It was all wonderful! As mentioned in other reviews, they serve big tall biscuits with a jam and rosemary butter. They were good but, {gasp!} I did not love them.    I can not wait to return here! I'm sorry I waited so long to make my first visit. I'd recommend reservations-- the place isn't terribly large."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We had the jalape√±o hush puppies as an appetizer and they were tasty but not much jalape√±o flavor. They bring you big layered biscuits thst we enjoyed with a rosemary butter and apple butter. Both of us had the fried chicken, one with morning style (chicken and waffles which were so savory and good with again, Rosemary and Apple liquor syrup). Mine was late night style with a bacon mac and cheese and then some cherry BBQ sauce. Mac and cheese was just okay, it was penne pasta with a sauce. Not the baked kind I expected. Overall, we liked it."}
{"text":"Soho is officially my favorite restaurant in Cleveland.  Had brunch here twice and it was really good.  But went this past Wednesday for Chicken Pickin's and it was incredible.  They have an a la carte menu with some great selections for very reasonable prices.  I tried both mild fried chicken and the hot fried chicken breasts and they were among the best fried chicken I've ever had.  I had sides of asparagus and Mac n cheese and the portions were very generous.  The sides were great compliments to the fried chicken.  The biscuits that are served upon arrival might be the best part! Served with rosemary butter and jam.  I could eat an entire basket of just these.  The best part about Wednesday's at Soho is you can mix and match the a la carte menu with the Happy Hour menu.  The $5 whiskey sours are fantastic.  Can't wait to get back here ASAP"}
{"text":"Really nice looking space. Good service. The biscuits they give you before your meal were very good, loved the strawberry jam and butter. Had the pulled pork, it was good but a little bit dry. Loved their house made hot sauce. All in all I would go back again."}
{"text":"love this place! i went there more than 3 months ago and I'm still craving their Crispy Catfish Poboy. It was perfectly cooked and crispy (the name doesn't lie), and the remoulade was delicious. I also really enjoyed their homemade chips, but they didn't warm up good in the microwave the next day =/  We also got the Mornin' Style Southern Fried Chicken which was a little dry, but still delicious, especially with the bourbon maple syrup"}
{"text":"I attempted to eat at Soho chicken and whisky before but the wait was too long. I was able make a reservation 4 hours ahead of time. There is a giant free parking lot near the restaurant which is really convent for such street full of restaurants. I had a Oxford cocktail + mornin' chicken thigh waffle but my favorite dish was really the devils eggs I will never forget how it taste like!"}
{"text":"Th ONLY place in Cleveland that understands southern cooking..  First restaurant I've came across that advertises \"southern shrimp and grits\" and not that chunky Quaker oats crap, actually true creamy southern style grits!!  I only wish the portion was a bit larger to accommodate the southern appetite I usually bring.   My fianc√©e got the chicken and waffles, and the fried chicken was falling off the bone tender!  Breading was amazing and even the sweet potato waffles were amazing!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to its Yelp hype!! The fried chicken is perfectly crispy without being drenched in grease, the Mac and cheese is phenomenal, and the drinks were good as well. The complementary biscuits come with apple butter and rosemary jam and are a welcome addition.   The only thing I would change about this place is the hours. They're never open for lunch, only brunch and dinner. I've been trying to go for years and today was the first day it worked out."}
{"text":"Poor quality food. The cheesy grits were dry, over salted and basically inedible. The fried tofu was just a thick block of tofu with some greasy breading on a plate, no flavor. We left hungry."}
{"text":"What a great new restaurant in Ohio City. The inside is nicely decorated and gives you a nice warm feeling. Looking out the windows gives you a real neighborhood feeling. The food is, as the name suggests, southern but with a modern twist. We shared the fried green tomatoes and the pimento cheese with the homemade BBQ chips. Delicious!! I would go back just for those two dishes. I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was nice and crispy on the outside but tender and juicy and the inside. My wife had the charred rib eye steak medium and it was done to perfection. For dessert I had the whoopie pies and my wife had the beignets. Both of which were very tasty. I had the Chattanooga cocktail which was like a blackberry whiskey sour - excellent.   The beer selection has some unusual selections so we can't wait to go back and try some of those with one of the good sounding sandwiches that are on the menu.  The service we had was excellent and we never felt rushed.  Our waitress told us they plan to have an outdoor eating area next summer.  It's so nice to have another good restaurant to add to our list."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for a while, and turns out there are a few places around Cleveland claiming to have that down home southern cooking taste that's hard to find in the Midwest. Being the southern cooking fan that I am I gave this one a try and I wasn't disappointed. To start they bring you a biscuit with a jam and some butter. There is a great bar and drink selection. For dinner I got the chicken Sandwich with fries. Now the chicken itself was quite good however the extra stuff on it as a topping seemed a bit much for my liking. I think it would have been perfect with less toppings and more spicy seasoning. But I'm a lover of spicy foods so I'm a bit biased. In any case I'd check this place out again!"}
{"text":"Had plans for lunch last Sunday at TownHall.  Arrived around noon only to find there was a \"90 MINUTE WAIT\" for two people (holy crap!).  So if you want to go to TownHall do yourself a favor and make a reservation (don't be a moron like me).    I am typically pretty good at having a Plan B, but in this case - and on my wife's 40th birthday - I had nothing.  Thank God for the Yelp app which led us to SOHO, a restaurant I have wanted to visit for quite some time now.  We only had a 30 minute wait at SOHO which was manageable.  We gave them our cell number and went to Westside Market until they called which we thought was awesome.  SOHO is very nice inside and the atmosphere is good.  The interior is such that one wouldn't be out of place dressed up, or in jeans and a t-shirt.  We happened to be very close to the waitress / waiter station and most of the wait staff, especially the ladies, seemed very pleasant.  The wait staff were hipsterish which fits SOHO very well.  The host at the front door puts off much more of a bouncer vibe than host.  The volume is loud, but we still managed to converse without issue.  Brunch, I believe, is all that is offered on Sunday.  For drinks, my wife orders a orange mimosa and thought it was decent.  For our meal, I try the rosemary waffles and fried chicken breast and thigh.  My wife orders the same, but substitutes fingerling potatoes for the waffles since she has a gluten sensitivity (the breading on the chicken is doable, an entire waffle is not).  Complimentary biscuits are delivered to the table and are solid.  Food comes out at about 35 minutes and the presentation is good.  The chicken is VERY good - a slam dunk.  Very flavorful, moist, and tender - everything you want chicken to be.  I was not a fan of the waffles.  I like waffles / syrup and rosemary, but these flavors were having a fistfight on my plate.  My wife also enjoyed her chicken and the potatoes were good too, but the latter was completely lacking salt and it isn't available on the table.  If salt isn't on the table, the kitchen should ensure it isn't overlooked prior to being served.  Our waiter wasn't real personable, but still did an ok job.  The price was about average for this type of restaurant at approximately $40 without tip.  We honestly really enjoyed our experience at SOHO.  Couple of little missteps, but it didn't detract much from the delicious chicken.  We plan to return for dinner in the future and expect good things."}
{"text":"So amazing, I'm kind of freaking out about it. My first time here, and already a devoted fan and looking forward to my future visits. Excellent cocktails. Homemade biscuits with house Rosemary butter and home made jam. I'm in love.  The happy hour menu was fantastic... but being our first visit, my husband and I wanted to try the chicken dinners since that is their featured dish, so we went for it. \"When in Rome.\" They were both perfection. This is easily my new favorite bar/restaurant on W. 25th.   (I was going to say \"spot\" but Nate's Deli will always be my #1 in my heart... but it's not a bar so...different categories as far as I'm concerned)."}
{"text":"Checked out SOHO for the first time tonight. It was a weds and that meant it was chickin and pickin night. Great special. My son and I both ordered 2 pieces of chicken and then ordered a couple of different sides each so we could try them. Mac n cheese was by far the best side. We also had coleslaw, deviled eggs and mashers n gravy. I wanted to try a dessert but was to stuffed! Plan on going back again and trying the shrimp n grits."}
{"text":"AMAZINGGGGGG  Was in Cleveland for my moms open heart surgery at the Cleveland Clinic (amazing hospital btw) and while she was getting her test done, my boyfriend and I decided to check this place out for brunch.  The restaurant decor is cozy, rustic with a touch of industrial- very dim lighting on a very dark Sunday morning so it made the restaurant feel less packed than it was  The food we ordered were the crispy beignets- super light and fluffy, the complimentary biscuits with the apple butter- sooooo good we wanted more and we both had the chicken and waffles, which my boyfriend declared as his top 3 favorite chicken and waffle he has ever had (and that's all he orders for brunch- which we do a lot so it's a big deal) and the bacon was coated in bourbon just so crispy and sweet and just wished I had more! The food didn't take too long to cook, considering how packed it was, waters were always full and the strawberry-rhubarb mimosa was tart but sweet, very light and different so try it once! Brunch was so good I bought a to go meal (steak and eggs) for my dad who was at the hospital and hadn't had real food in a week- he was so grateful and happy that when he came back home from Cleveland after 2 1/2 weeks with my Mom he asked for the restaurant name so that for her 6 week checkup he could go eat while she is taking her test! So good wish it was in DC because I would brunch/dinner here all the time!"}
{"text":"Wednesday nights are Fried chicken night and its awesome.  You can customize your chicken order unlike the normal dinner and you get to pick your sides as well.  The ranged is 1.50 for a wing to 4.50 for chicken breast.  I enjoyed the spicy breading even more than the original although it is pretty spicy. I loved the mac cheese as well, sides are a generous portion and reasonably priced at 3.50$.  I cannot wait to back on a Wednesday evening. The cocktails are about 8$ and excellent also.  The five stars is for the fried chicken and mac cheese on a Wednesday because you pick your piece.  I've had the fried chicken couple times and the spice level is inconsistent for the spicy breading so if you cannot tolerate hot food better to stick with the original flavor."}
{"text":"Yup, SOHO's still got it.  Came here for a light dinner. Which resulted in me stuffing my face with biscuits, of course. God those biscuits are so GD good. Paired with that rosemary butter. Should be illegal. I was thirsty so I got the Lynchburg (Tennessee Whiskey, limeade, ginger beer, mint). Holy moly was it a strong drink. The Southern Harvest salad was on point. Baby kale, apple, dried berries, sweet potato, spiced pecans & pumpkin seeds, goat cheese, and a lovely light orange-mustard vinaigrette. Sooo scrumptious. I tried my gal pal's smoked gouda mac-n-cheese and oh my lord it was heaven on a plate. Smoked gouda in mac? Genius. I gotta say SOHO you made my Friday night SOHO good :D"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. The best chicken sandwich I've ever had. Everything is reasonably priced and the cocktails are delicious. Highly recommend for brunch & dinner."}
{"text":"yes! Chicken and waffles on point. Get the bacon at brunch. Pretty good looking waitresses. Great apple jam butter stuff. Oh collard greens are good, too. Sweaty bloody Mary's - just the way I like em'.   Overall, would suggest it for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner. Only negative is they gave goofy hours.   Drops mic."}
{"text":"Wish I would've come here with a bit more of an appetite so I could have tried the chicken & waffles, but I guess that means I'll just have to come back b/c what I had was pretty damn good.  I probably shouldn't have ordered it, as I was just coming from South Carolina, but I went with the Pulled Pork sandwich w/ Carolina slaw.  It may have suffered slightly by comparison, but I've known for years you simply can't get the superior experience up North...and I've tried, believe me.  I must say, though, it was damn good...they used a mustard sauce, but managed to keep it from being overly sweet, which is an accomplishment.  Excellent sandwich.  The bread was fresh as could be, and the slaw was tasty.  It came with house made potato chips pickled veg, both of which rocked as well.  A lot of times those chips can be on the uncrisp side of the equation, but these were crispy and well-seasoned.  I got a side of jalapeno hush puppies, and let me just say that they nailed it.  I was skeptical, b/c I eat the homemade variety every time I head South, but these were friggin' awesome.  A1.  Oh, and I was able to try my friends Mac & Cheese...duuuuuuuudes.  Seriously.  Next level.  The decor is possibly the best I've seen in NE Ohio, save for Greenhouse Tavern - really well done modern minimalistic approach, but still very comfy.  Service was very pleasant and laid back, which matches the cuisine.  Man, Cleveland totally needs a place like this, and I hope it does well for years to come.  The place was packed, so hopefully that's a sign.  I will *definitely* be back on my next trip to try out all the other interesting looking items on the menu.  ***Mega bonus points for having 21A Back In Black IPA on the beer list!!!"}
{"text":"2 stars.  The first is for atmosphere. This place nails it.  Exhibit A - the bathroom doors.   The second star is for libations. My Corpus Christy (like a spicy bloody mary, but with moonshine) was awesome.  The stars that it lacked: service, price, food.  Service: My food was late, and a bit cold. It did not come out the other food served.  Also, when I finished my drink, was never asked if I'd like another.   Price - check out the menu. It's very pricey for what you get. My drink was $8. My grilled cheese was $12.  Food. My grilled cheese sandwich didn't pack much flavor, especially when it's $12. They did make a pretty good jalapeno hush puppy though. Although I hear they make a great chicken and waffles, though.  As far as being a 'modern' restaurant, they don't feature many vegan/veggie options, but what can you expect from a southern barbecue restaurant.  Is it worth another shot? Only if I get dragged there with friends."}
{"text":"Wow! This place served up the best food I've had in Cleveland yet!  Cooking up a modern approach on southern cooking, SOHO certainly delivers! I got the eggs benedict, my friend got the steak and eggs. We also got an order of deviled eggs and a side of bacon.  Having grown up in the South, seeing all what we ordered on our table made me feel like I was at a family reunion!  Although I didn't order one, they even have regional beverages (including Cheerwine!) and what looks like a well-stocked bar.  The atmosphere was fine - we would have preferred to sit outside but the weather wasn't cooperating! Additionally, our waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed. Perhaps the only non-southern thing about the restaurant was the service - our waitress could have been a lot more welcoming and friendly -- oh well, the food more than made up for that!  The biscuits they served at the beginning of the meal were fluffy, buttery (but we put more on -- can't have too much butter!), and basically everything anyone could ever want in a biscuit.   The appetizers, bacon and deviled aggs, were amazing. I don't think too many people have had deviled eggs, so I encourage  you to order them not only to try them, but to bask in their mayonnaise-y, delectable, and perfectly cooked half-eggness. The bacon, thick-cut, sweet, and savory, was a huge hit -- THAT's how you do bacon!  My eggs benedict wasn't a traditional eggs benedict at all. The hollandaise sauce had a kick and the biscuit they used wasn't a biscuit. I actually still have no idea what it was. All I know is that it was breaded, fried, and delicious and I want more. In addition, the \"eggs\" part of the eggs benedict were perfectly cooked. The potato fries were excellent as well. This was a very solid dish.   My friend ordered the steak and eggs, also a great choice. I only had a bite or two, but it was served over spinach and marinated in a really savory steak sauce. Maybe next time I'll get  that!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the biscuits! I've had better, but that was in the south where I'm from. The chicken was delicious. I personally like to have my bones kept in & to eat fried chicken with my hands so I can say that it's finger-lickin' good, but to each his own.   PS - call for reservations. Our group of 4 came at 530 on a Saturday and all the tables were booked!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED everything about SoHo. From the atmosphere to the service even the food was great. I went on a Wednesday night and turns out they have chicken specials, so good!   The beers and mixed drinks were unique and wonderful. The staff worked together to help each other out which was really nice. I liked that they brought out bisquets with their own jam and butter, so good.   I would def recommend trying out some SoHo :)"}
{"text":"Great comfort food. Delicious biscuits when you sit down - should've skipped the appetizer the biscuits were plenty.  Late Night chicken w Mac n cheese w bacon is a winner!"}
{"text":"Why travel to the South (well, I guess besides for the good weather) when you can be transported there via West 25th Street? SOHO's serving us Clevelanders the South's hardy, classic staples with modern gourmet flair!  I am on West 25th Street a lot, but I had never been to SOHO until last night when I came with my parents, and I was absolutely blown away by my dinner.  When I came in, I was struck by the energetic and modern ambience. The restaurant was dimly lit, with exposed-brick and dark walls, and cool bluesy music playing. There was a diverse cliental seated around, from hipsters to a group of women on a bachelorette party to older, well-to-do looking people.   After we had placed our orders, three beautifully puffy, warm biscuits arrived at our table with rosemary butter and apple jam. I am a sucker for a good, buttery biscuit, and these were great! They set a good tone for the meal, since they was the first of many tasty treats to come.  To start, we shared a special New Orleans style shrimp which came atop a piece of grilled bread. The shrimp had a smoky, flavorfully spiced sauce which the bread soaked up! I ordered the duck Gumbo soup, which thick consistency and was deeply rich and well-spiced.  As a main course, I got the Sweet Potato dumplings. These dumplings made me think of the most perfectly prepared, oversized sweet potato gnocchi. They were lightly grilled on the outside and the insides were soft, smooth, and velvety. They were tossed with cranberries, caramelized onions, spinach, soft cheese, and goat cheese in a maple-brown butter sauce, which was the slightest bit sweet and played well with the savoriness of the butter.  My father ordered the fried chicken \"mornin' style,\" which came atop rosemary waffles with maple syrup on the side. This dish was fantastic. The fried chicken was delicious and not at all greasy. The savoriness of the chicken is offset by the sweetness of the maple syrup. But unexpectedly, it was the waffles that stole the show! They were pillowy soft and the rosemary and a beautiful savory, aromatic flavor. I think this was a fabulous, unexpected spin on waffles! I think I am going to copy when I make my own!  My mother ordered the shrimp and grits, and this was again a great dish. The mellow sweetness of the corn in the grits when well with the perfectly cooked shrimp and the sausage.  For dessert, we ordered the pecan pie as per our server's recommendation. Some pecan pies are way to sweet and can get a gelatinous texture, but this pecan pie was amazing. It was not at all too sweet, had a delicious buttery crust, and came with a generous scoop of bourbon ice cream.  This is rare for me to say, but all our dishes were flawless and were well-composed in terms of the balances of flavors and textures. I know I will be raving about SOHO to my friends, and I will definitely be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"Busy Saturday evening.   Sat quick, served quick.  And omg, get the tomato bisque soup!!! Yum yum! Comes with a little side of bread with Brie cheese on it, I could eat this all day!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand what happened to the place. First, they limited menu to literally 7 entrees (steak, fish, chicken). Out of which trout is overcooked and steak leaves much more to be desired. Then they removed stuffed pork-chop from the menu ( it was definitely sensational) and added some blend lowcountry boil which has some seafood but lacks spices. Trout mousse was good along with green fried tomatoes. Stay clear of cheese dip aka your 6 month sodium intake.  And finally, who puts only one waitress to serve an entire dining room? She has only 2 hands, 2 legs an thus limited to serve about 20 hungry people. Real South has bigger heart. It would have spared her and us from this nightmare."}
{"text":"What a great start to the day. We initially went to the Great Lakes brewing company and had a couple of free beers. We then traveled to Soho chicken and whiskey.  We ordered the stuffed pig bloody Mary's which consisted of a bacon infused salt rim with the perfectly seasoned bloody Mary mix which included a pickled okra and a piece of Swiss cheese. On top you could add a beef jerky stick straw for two dollars in addition.  My friend ordered the Del sol which was a fresh fruit breakfast margarita including blood orange and grape fruit flavors  In addition, and they all gave us a house made breakfast biscuits with homemade jam and butter with scallions  We ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken fried pork salad. This all came out with a perfectly fried pork. With a side of three deviled eggs. Deviled eggs we had pieces of pickled carrots with them. That's all consisted of fresh cut corn sweetcorn.  Side of bacon bits with maple syrup, pieces of avocado on top sprinkle the paprika. The pork cutlet complemented the salad well and the textures and flavors were exceptional.  The chicken and waffles or delicately plated. The chicken was well Brined for the most part. The piece that I had was a bit on the dry am. However, the nice Thyme flavor to the chicken gave it a little sense of Thanksgiving.  In addition the outside patio was a nice complement to the wonderful weather we're having today. The bar has a TV and it also is open up through the patio. Will be a great place for a nice brunch and gathering for friends and family. Highly recommend someone check this place out. I would have given a four a half stars, but yelp doesn't have halfs.  A little hidden gem in Ohio city that is right in the brew districts next to market Garden brewery."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Dinner - Sunrise. The meal was delicious. The chicken was wonderfully crispy, and the fried rice perfectly complemented the taste of chicken. It was a great combination. Strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"Probably the best fried chicken in Cleveland!  Nolan and Molly do a great job with the menu and the service. They are also the only place in cleveland that does the Pappy Van Winkle tasting, which is an amazing event!! They also did a great job for our rehearsal dinner."}
{"text":"We were planning on checking out Town Hall for Sunday brunch but were turned off by the loud crowd and 1 hour wait.  Walked down the street and decided to look inside SOHO, not knowing anything about it.  We were immediately impressed by the relaxed vibe and the friendly staff.  We had a seat at the bar and enjoyed two delicious breakfast cocktails.  I ordered the Chicken and Waffles.  The fried chicken was perfectly cooked: crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  The waffles were outstanding and the house hot sauce was a perfect complement.  Pricing was fair for the quality, but came out at close to $50 for two brunches and two cocktails, so definitely don't come expecting a bargain.  While there may be trendier places on W25th, SOHO has a great little restaurant that is much more my style.  Will plan on coming back again!"}
{"text":"Husband ordered Pollo Frita with a side of hush puppies - the hush puppies were delicious and his pollo frita was very good too  I ordered Hush Puppies and Gravy with a side of bacon - the bacon was amazing! Unfortunately, my meal came out cold and I had to send it back. When it came out the second time it was much better and had a nice taste.   The coffee here was delicious (and we are tough on coffee) and so were the biscuits!!"}
{"text":"FREE COMPLIMENTARY HOMEMADE BISCUIT ALERT!!!  Yes, you read that right. You sit down and are greeted with homemade biscuits, jam, and rosemary butter. If that isn't a warm welcome I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS!   We stopped in on a rainy Sunday for brunch and split the chicken and waffles. Let me start by saying, the house made hot sauce is one for the record books. It is one of the best hot sauces I have had in a long time. As for the chicken and waffles, I thought everything about the flavor was great! The chicken cutlet was pipping hot. My only problem was the breading basically slid off as soon as you touched it. The waffles had rosemary in them which was a nice touch and the real maple syrup mixed with the hot sauce was MONEY.  I really loved the warm service, and the style/decor of the restaurant is contemporary and trendy.   I would definitley hit this place up again while in CLE, and would not forget to ask about buying a bottle of that hot sauce because, dang that shizz was good!"}
{"text":"What a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Come really hungry - Don't fill up on the most amazing biscuits in the world.  Orderd the chicken and waffles thought it was outstanding the bacon was delicious too."}
{"text":"This is some of the BEST chicken and biscuits I have ever had! Amazing food and the staff was so accomidating to us. We had brought my daughter who was about 3 months old at the time and even though the restaurant is small they had no issues with us bringing her stroller in."}
{"text":"Four stars because of pricing only. The guy who dare the up the prices for bourbon had obviously been hitting the bottle! Sick of Ohio City pricing. Chicken and other food was awesome and so was the service."}
{"text":"Highly recommend a visit to Soho if in Cleveland.   Was in town with my daughter for a college visit at Case Western.  We went here for brunch on Saturday before heading to the airport back to Texas.  She had the chicken and waffles and I had the shrimp and grits.  Both were excellent.  If she decides to apply to Case or go to a summer program we will definitely be back to sample dinner menu.   Like others report this place fills up fast.  We got there a little before it opened and people were already waiting outside.  Got a table but the place filled up within 20-30 minutes of opening.   Excellent food and service.  Trendy part of town with lots of cool spots nearby."}
{"text":"A great little restaurant in Ohio city.  Friendly staff, clean and cozy environment, and delicious food. The shrimp and grits were flavorful and a satisfactory serving size, as were the chicken and waffles my husband got.  Their cocktail menu had some great staples on it, and their Bloody Mary we tried was very tasty.  I'm definitely interested in going back and trying different food dishes and different cocktails. Everything sounded wonderful.  The service was great, and they even accommodated a high chair for us.  Parking is a challenge sometimes, but I think there's valet options on W 25th during certain hours. I'd also recommend making reservations because the restaurant is rather Small."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! I knew when the fresh homemade biscuits arrived when we sat down this place was going to be off the charts!!!! The fried chicken is so juicy and so flavorful it's worth every calorie!  The sides of Cole slaw and macaroni and cheese tops this as one of my favorite southern cooking meals! Great whiskey offerings and to top it off you must order the Beignet! Served with powder sugar and chocolate sauce! A must gut buster!!!"}
{"text":"Wandered in here after opening day at the Jake, and couldn't be happier with the result!  Service was good, and the food was great as well!  I immediately saw the sandwich ingredients (fried chicken breast, pimento cheese, vinegar slaw, and housemade pickles) and knew that was what I was getting.  It did not disappoint!  Friends got the deviled eggs (awesome) and fish and chips (solid, but not amazing).    The bramble smash we had was also a great cocktail to cap off the night!  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Some of the best fried chicken we've ever had. I love that it's boneless so you get lots of meat without having to pick around a bone. The waiter was very accommodating and found a way for me to get the strawberry salad with fried chicken and it was delicious! I went with my boyfriend and our friend and everyone loved their food and experience. We ate outside which was a really nice patio, the inside seemed a little small and dark for such a nice day. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Soho is just another unfortunate product of an over-hyped, overly anticipated new food venture that failed to meat expectations on several levels.   Case and point: Local foodies were prematurely speaking of Soho months in advance of it's opening. Salivating and fantasizing of the very much needed concept of Southern cuisine that is still very sparse among the Cleveland dining landscape. \"At last!\", they seemed to say in unison. A hip, modern take on Southern hospitality!   And then Soho opened. And we went there. And we dined. And ate. And drank. And we were disappointed by it all. Another far reaching take on Southern cuisine that just didn't cut it. Sigh....  Where did it all go wrong? First off the menu is very unadventurous. Stereotypical Southern food done in a stereotypical, unexciting way. The majority of the menu is either battered, deep-fried or smothered in a heavy sauce or syrup. The portions were absolutely humongous and somewhat insulting. Half the menu is made-up of Po-Boy sandwiches the size of your head. The plates I saw leave the kitchen seemed like enough food to feed a family of 4.  I ordered a bowl of sweet potato bisque with marshmallow cream and spiced peanuts to start.  I could barely taste either the marshmallow or peanuts. Next I ordered the chicken and waffles. 2 legs and a giant breast; overly breaded, heavy and deep fried atop 2 waffles. The fried chicken had so much breading that it wasn't cooked all the way though. Red juices were still seeping from the bones of the chicken legs. Not very appetizing and unacceptable. We also ordered a side of the jalapeno hush puppies which were flavorless, overcooked and as dry as sand. Those went unfinished. For dessert and with every bit of energy soaked up by all of the grease consumed, we opted to get a slice of pecan pie to take home.   Each entr√©e on the menu was listed at a flat-fee of $17 a piece. With no rhyme or reason, that just seems lazy. Also, I don't know about the rest of you, but when I eat out, I don't expect to be fed on leftovers for days later. I really wish some restaurants would lessen the portions and instead focus on quality vs. quantity. For people who want quantity, the Golden Corral exists for a reason. For the rest of us, give us a plate food a normal person is able to consume. Trying to compensate size over what truly matters is somewhat telling of a person... ahem, I mean.... a restaurant's soul."}
{"text":"Soho is my new favorite place for brunch! My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday morning and we were expecting Soho to be very crowded. We were pleasantly surprised when we walked in and were seated right away. The atmosphere is cool as well as the decorations. Our waitress was so sweet and gave us suggestions about what we should try for food and drink. We took her suggestions and they were so amazing. The food was literally to die for. I highly recommend Soho. I can't wait to return for dinner."}
{"text":"I can't complain about much here. I had the Shrimp and Grits and it was surprisingly wonderful considering I'm not too fond of grits.(Actually, I hate them!!) But these were great.... so great, I'd eat them again. My friend had the Fried Chicken (Late Night Style) and loved it. I did have a bite of his meal and I thought it was...okay. I preferred my dish hands down. We also tried a variety of their cocktails and all were good with an excellent pour. The dessert: I had the pecan pie and unfortunately I was not a fan. I usually love my desserts, but this one was way too sugary and even a little grainy. This place would have gotten 4 starts were it not for the service. Our server was VERY friendly and helpful WHEN WE SEEN HER, which wasn't very often. It was very busy when we first arrived but cleared up halfway through our dinner and I had to hunt her down in order to ask for dessert and yet again to get the bill. I'll go back again and hope the service was just a fluke."}
{"text":"Wandering through Ohio City with a friend looking for brunch, we decided to stop in to Soho and see what it was about. We were seated quickly--just a hint of the excellent service we were provided!   I started with one of their drinks, the gentleman's something, and my friend had an apple soda. My drink was awesome and also deadly--I could taste the whiskey but the other ingredients had made it so sweet I forgot it was was whiskey! Oops...   When we ordered, I immediately gravitated towards the jalape√±o poppers and the shrimp and grits. I ordered both, but when the waitress asked if I wanted the poppers with my biscuits (HOT BISCUITS???!!), I had to cut out the poppers.   The biscuits, by the way, were awesome. So fluffy and towering that I was able to split it into thirds! The garlic butter was good but the jam was EXCELLENT. I wish there had been more of it :(   My shrimp and grits were delicious. The shrimp was nicely grilled with a delicious sear, the asparagus still had some crunch, and the cheese was blended in a delicate way. I devoured it all! My friend had decided you can never have too many biscuits, so he ordered their biscuits with gravy. When it came out, there was so much gravy you almost couldn't see the biscuits! Suffice to say, he couldn't finish it and took the leftovers home :)   Overall, a lovely experience. Our plans suddenly changed and we had to cut our brunch 20 minutes short. Luckily, the wait staff had been so attentive that we didn't even have to flag someone down and they soon had a doggie bag and check at the table. Much appreciated.   I don't do brunch often, but I definitely want to come back for those jalape√±o poppers and to try their normal menu!"}
{"text":"My husband, 4 month old, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere here. It's not too loud and we were sat in a comfortable space. We had a stroller with us and the waitress was able to immediately accommodate us. The service was top notch. We really liked their strawberry rhubarb mimosa. The food was fresh and hot with great flavor. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Soho is a charming spot for a great meal!  I went on a Sunday for brunch and ended up waiting a bit for the doors to open as we arrived a little before their 11AM opening time. I didn't mind as we were quickly seated on a small, but beautiful patio with a view of Mitchell's Ice Cream.  We were quick to order and even having just opened, our coffee and complimentary and completely unexpected biscuits came. This is such a delightful little addition as it kept us quite content before our meal even though our food came relatively quickly! They also aren't just the run of the mill biscuits, but were good enough that I might have mistook them for something I would order a la carte.   We ordered the steak and eggs as well as the chicken + waffle. I've included the pictures so you can see they were plated beautifully and I will say the steak and eggs are divine. I was fairly happy with my chicken and waffle as it includes both a breast and thigh (light and dark meat) and was portioned appropriately - I sometimes feel a full waffle and two types of chicken is just far too much food for a single sitting.   Service was fantastic and I fully intend on returning during a day when I can booze a bit more as that was one thing I wish I would have done after this initial meal.   Bottom line, great service, excellent food, and good ambiance makes this place a keeper in my book and place I will likely return."}
{"text":"Have you ever wanted to try the best fried chicken in Cleveland? Eat at Soho, especially on a Wednesday when you can get a great deal during their Chicken Pickin'  nights. Aside from the chicken, great Southern cuisine, friendly service and fun cocktails."}
{"text":"Per usual, some friends and I were hungover and tired on a Sunday morning and didn't have the wherewithal to cobble together our own makeshift breakfast, so we decided to go out for brunch. Somebody suggested this place, and I'm glad they did, because it was DEE-LISH. (That's my Dee-Lite cover band, BTW.) My impression is that it's pretty much gussied up southern cooking that is tasty and not crazy expensive. I got the chicken and waffles, and, like, the chicken was Chick-Fil-A good. I can't go there anymore due to their hatred of 30 percent of my friends, so it's nice to see that somebody else cracked the code. A side order of cheese grits damn near completed my Sunday. I was too far gone to imbibe in any alcoholic beverages, but their choices seemed pretty righteous. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"SOHO is a great place for a vegetarian and carnivore to peacefully co-exist.  We went in on a Saturday night, the restaurant was mostly full, but we were seated right away.  We started out with 2 baton rouge cocktails which were absolutely delicious. The appetizers of chicken fried oysters were hot, crispy and super tasty.  For an entree, the husband had the low country boil which he raved about and I got the Mornin' Style chicken vegetarian.  It consisted of rosemary waffles, fried tofu and pure awesomeness.  They have a homemade (at least it tastes homemade) hot sauce on the table which was great.  Service was on point and the atmosphere is cool.  This is probably my favorite restaurant in the OC right now."}
{"text":"A really fantastic brunch and atmosphere. The staff is very attentive and service orientated. We loved the Chicken and Waffles. The Brunch drink menu is great too. The Bourbon menu is off the hook!   Carry on and keep making fantastic dishes. My highest recommendation."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoyed this place. The prices are high, but the cocktails are well made and the dishes are great. We decided to go tapas style and order a few small items. We got the deviled eggs, the Mac and cheese, and the fried green tomatoes. All, except the deviled eggs, hit the spot and tasted wonderful. Service was pleasant, and the ambiance was dark and warm. No complaints."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, you're smacked with nothing but ambiance. The intimate dining area paired with a gorgeous bar makes you feel cozy and calm before you even begin dining. On top of the gorgeous decor, this Ohio City restaurant nails comfort food.  Soho made me say \"treat yo self\" over and over. From the buttery biscuits topped with homemade jam to the crispy chicken and creamy mash, I was absolutely drowning in flavor. The collard greens from the \"late night\" plate and the rosemary waffles from the \"mornin\" are absolutely must tries.  Soho is a perfect date night spot or family brunch go-to that will have your taste buds running to Flavortown."}
{"text":"Amazing! Went for brunch, the service is top notch, they make you feel welcome the second you walk into the door. Great food as well, had amazing chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Ok...let me just start this review by prefacing that my Grandmother has lived in Appalachia most of her life and I know Southern food like the back of my moonshine clenching hand.  We went to SOHO for \"Happy Hour\" and their Wednesday chicken scratch deals.  Place was not too bad and in the immortal words of Gang Starr \" Let me break it down for sections for you slowpokes\":  Server:  Very nice and quick with the booze.  It did seem like there were random people bringing us stuff so I guess she was our server?  Still, she was very nice.  Towards the end of the meal she did kind of disappeared but there were other peeps flowing in like sasparilla off Wyatt Earps sweet moustache!    \"Happy Hour\": Kind of a joke.  The only \"deals\" ya get are if ya sit at the tiny bar area (which was mostly full at 5:30)  We ordered full price beers, which in my mind are on the expensive side.  I also ordered what seemed to be a house drink which had bourbon, peach nectar and some other stuff with a lime garnish. It was good but I could barely taste the sweet Kentucky nectar and it was flipping WAY over priced at 8.50.  I see this as a new trend where these new pub/restaurant type places way overcharge for drinks.  I know what liquor costs and they are making a killing.  As in my other reviews people know, I whack back a few even before my food comes so my liquor tab is usually more than the food...  Food: Chicken was OK.  We got the \"hot\" and it had way too much cayenne and it burned my mouth for a while after.  I like hot but its a lingering heat that was too much even for me.  Next time Ill just go sissy style and use their homemade hot sauce.   I did like that the thighs I got were boneless but the crust all fell off at one bite.  Try the dark meat when eating fried chicken..chicken breast are the wuss, fancypants version.  Greens were fine.  I like them chopped a little finer with a vinegar kick.  I would say add some ham hocks but the new age hippie types would be all up in arms that its not vegetarian or something.  Mashed potatoes were awesome!  SUPER rceamy and still really hot when they came to us. The corn fritter things were good too and that dipping sauce was so good I would wear a fanny pack full of it for a week just to keep it close to me.    Ambiance:  Who cares...I came here for fried chicken and bourbon, right?  Skip all the fancy tea lights, carafes for water and hip decor and pass the savings onto the customer.  They were playing a whole block of Chuck Berry so that alone gets a star!    In closing:  This isnt your run-of-the-mill Southern chicken shack ya see all through the South..its the W. 25th street valet parking kind of joint.  65 bux for 2 for \"happy hr\" is double what im used to but I will try it again...after I sell plasma or something..."}
{"text":"Oh my yum! I wish I could re-eat everything that I had at Soho. We kicked off brunch with some biscuits with apple butter which were amazing. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my friend ordered the steak and eggs. We split both, which was more than enough food for the two of us. We were stuffed for the entire day. For drinks I sprung for the gin fizz, which was foamy and delicious, and my friend ordered the peach mimosa which she loved.   Definitely a great choice for brunch."}
{"text":"Daaaaamn, SOHO, where have you been all my life? A family friend told me they have the best chicken & waffles in town, but I'd just never made it over to try them. On our six-month marker, my boyfriend surprised me with dinner here; because it was a Tuesday night, we were seated quickly, & though there were a few other tables filled, the ambiance was generally quiet & low-key.  We split the Jalapeno hushpuppies served with \"comeback sauce,\" which our served described as \"Probably a mix of mayo & ketchup?\" It was better than it sounds, I promise, & the hushpuppies were perfect - lightly spicy, very crispy, & not too dry, like hushpuppies sometimes are. We were also served a few pieces of fresh, hot bread with house-made seasoned butter & some kind of jam (I forget what kind) that I would've eaten with a spoon if it were an option.  Needless to say, we were carbed-up & happy by the time our meals arrived, but we'd left plenty of room for dinner. And good thing! My boyfriend ordered his fried chicken \"evenin' style,\" served with mashed potatoes, braised collards, & sausage gravy; I,. of course, ordered mine \"mornin' style,\" with a rosemary waffle & Ohio maple syrup. The other option, which I'd love to try, is \"late-night style,\" with pulled pork mac 'n' cheese, & smoked cherry bbq sauce. I KNOW, RIGHT? They're all served with boneless chicken - a breast & a thigh. I don't like dark meat, & getting it with all-white meat wasn't an option, so my boyfriend & I swapped - all-white for me, all-dark for him. A good trade, but I wish I could've just ordered it the way I wanted it.  That said, everything was delicious. The waffle was hot & soft, & the chicken was perfectly done, with the crispy coating so fresh that it was sliding off of the meat. I was too full to eat all of it, but I took one of the breasts home for leftovers the next day. Just as good afterward!  SOHO has a number of interesting-sounding items on their menu that I'd love to go back to try - but honestly, the mornin'-style chicken was so tasty that I don't know if I could bring myself to order anything else!  Minus one star for the very slow service, because only one server seemed to be working that night, & she was also playing hostess - crazy! Though she was very friendly & accomodating, the fact that she was flying solo meant the service was understandably under par. I'd still go back, but I hope they don't make a habit of being so understaffed."}
{"text":"I was super excited about this place--I decided to surprise a friend for her birthday with dinner here. When we arrived a bit early for our 7:30 reservation, our table wasn't quite ready (no problem, we were early) so we went to the bar for drinks.  It took the two bartenders at least 8 minutes (I timed it) to greet us before we ordered our drinks. I was annoyed.  When we were finally seated, no one came to our table for a long time. We weren't greeted by a server or anything. We just sat there looking around waiting for someone to approach our table.  I soon realized that there was ONE server taking care of the entire room. This is purely unacceptable for a Saturday night. This poor girl was busting ass and didn't have anyone helping her. She was fantastic and charming, but seriously, we waited forever for everything because she was so busy. What a nightmare.  Between the three of us, we ordered the pimento cheese dip and the Johnny cakes for appetizers. Both delicious...the homemade BBQ chips with the dip was the hit of the night for me.   For entrees we got the late night fried chicken, shrimp and grits, and the country ham wrapped scallops with asparagus (this was on special for the evening). The scallops and shrimp and grits were amazing. The fried chicken was just ok...I was expecting a little more \"wow\" factor since this is their main staple.   All in all, I would come back to give this place another shot because every restaurant or bar has an off night. Perhaps we caught them on theirs. I'm just hoping the next time we return the service will be more on point and we will actually feel a bit of that \"southern hospitality\" that they promote.  Three stars because the service needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"Fried chicken? Yes, please! A friend and I decided to hit up Soho Chicken + Whiskey on a Friday night. Parking was a bit difficult to find but we scored a spot right in front the restaurant. Winning! Online reservations are not a thing but they do take them by phone. Luckily, when we got there, we were able to get two spots at the bar.   Before our dinner was served, we received complimentary biscuits with rosemary butter and apple jam. The sweet and savory worked well together. The biscuits were warm and inviting. They had a bit of crunch on the outside but fluffy on the inside.   I had the Sunrise Chicken Dinner. You have a choice of a breast or thigh and I got both. The Sunrise is served with fried rice composed of rice, bacon, sausage, sweet potatoes, and peas. The dish is topped with a sunnyside egg. The chicken was brined, breaded, and deep fried just the way I like it! The meat was tender and juicy and the coating was crisp and tasty. The fried rice was well done and the sweet potatoes and peas added a bit of sweetness to contrast the bacon and sausage. I didn't need hot sauce for my chicken because the plate had sriracha on it which was the appropriate spice for the dish. Unfortunately, I overestimated my appetite and couldn't finish my food. I had it for breakfast the next day and it tasted great!   The bartender provided great service, was conversational, and was quick with doing all the things! It was a great meal and I was glad I got to try it!"}
{"text":"First off I need to start out by saying our waitress was amazing! I called and made reservations for 12 and they accommodated us with no issues. The poplar dish ordered was chicken and waffles. I ordered the steak and it was just okay. This isn't a streak restaurant so that does not effect my review. If you enjoy southern style food you will love this place! I'm not a big fan of that style of food but I can make an exception for SOHO. You won't be sorry"}
{"text":"De-lish! This is one of my favorite places to grab a cocktail (try the one with blackberry, or the one with bourbon, or the... yeah, just try them all), and the chicken and waffles is crazy good. Like, now I see why that dish has such a cult following. Sweet, fluffy waffles, savory lean chicken, and great syrup. Also, apple butter and fresh rolls on each table, and a Charleston Chew as you walk out the door.   My only qualm is that everything, starting with appetizers and sides, starts around the $10+ range, which makes it hard to leave with a full wallet. Still, it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I've had in Cleveland since moving from Kentucky. My go to is the Shrimp and Grits for brunch. Fried Chicken for dinner. Happy hour is great with a variety of small plates and a predetermined happy hour cocktail. Make a reservation if you want to go for dinner as it fills up quick and there isn't much standing room to wait if the bar is full."}
{"text":"Really, really great service. Friendly but not obnoxious, just perfect! Both my wife and my son had the bird sandwich. The portion was just right, the fries were crisp and warm, with strips of skin here and there.     I had the Evenin Chicken dinner. Chicken was delicious, moist, with a lovely crunch. The asparagus were cooked right, and the mashed potatoes were simply divine.   The hot sauce that was provided did not give the heat I was expecting, so I asked if they had anything hotter. Well, here is a secret you need to know: they have this really nice hot sauce that they normally offer only on Wednesday night. Well, demand it, regardless of the night! They describe it as \"chicken fat\" sauce. It's actually nicely spiced rendered schmaltz (look it up). But don't tell anybody.   You have to go there."}
{"text":"By far the best biscuits and fried chicken I've had. Maybe I need to try more places; I don't consider myself an expert on either.  Be warned: if you don't make a reservation here, depending on what time of day it might be a long wait until you're seated.  I fortunately came here on a Sunday morning with my boyfriend. The waitress found seating for us outside, and kindly offered us menus and water. I decided to order the chicken and waffles and he got the pollo frito as well as a side of the bourbon bacon ($5). We were served complimentary biscuits, jam and butter. Honestly these biscuits were so tender and warm, so buttery, I could've eaten them plain. The jam and butter added on changed the flavor in different ways. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!  The main meal was pretty large in terms of portion size. The chicken was fried perfectly, crunchy on the outside, soft tender and so moist on the inside. I had to slow myself down to savor the meal or else I'd finish it in 10 minutes. My boyfriends meal consisted of a piece of fried chicken in a deep dish of potato and beans topped with a fried egg. It had a nice spice to it and a balance of savory flavors throughout. I couldn't finish my chicken and waffles or the bacon so I decided to take it back. When I asked the waitress to box it for me, she even asked if I wanted a container for the maple syrup included. She read my mind and said it just before I was going to bring it up! Now that's good service.  I would definitely return here. It's a classy place with a great atmosphere, staff, and most importantly, food!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance here, modern southern vibe. The hostesses, bartenders and our server were all personable, happy go lucky and very good at their jobs. I was really impressed by everyone we encountered on staff.   The gumbo was tasty but the Nashville Fried Catfish stole the show. I'll be talking about that meal for a long time coming. It was spicy, but not so spicy that you only taste hot sauce. The heat accompanied the dish well, I could still taste the fish. It sat atop a bed of creamy coleslaw that paired so well with the dish. It was delectable. I also love that you get complimentary biscuits here.   This place rocks, there are so many options in Ohio City but I would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Omg shrimp and grits omg soooo good. Smokey mac and cheese awesome too. great service on top of it all."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Was on vacation and passed through. Decided to try this place out. The cheese dip is delicious and the salad with the fried chicken is delish!  I think it's called the nooner. I wish this place was near where I live. :("}
{"text":"Wow! Chicken the way you want it. All bomb diggity!!! Evening and morning are solid. Prob best to pair with whiskey from the expansive menu. If you like fried chicken and bourbons whiskey get the f in there!"}
{"text":"Soho has the best food in the Ohio City area. The fried chicken meals are unbelievable and the appetizers are very solid. The staff is great and the restaurant itself is clean and comfortable.   I definitely recommend this place for lunch or dinner. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"i sometimes forget about this hidden little gem in the ohio city area. small room, hip vibe, casually clad servers, good food and drinks, 'nuf said!"}
{"text":"Soho is definitely a restaurant worth trying! I came here for brunch and was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait to be seated even though the restaurant seemed pretty busy. I love that they give you a complimentary biscuit before your entree here. When looking at the brunch menu, I was originally tempted to order a different dish, but I figured I got to try the chicken and waffles at a place with chicken in its name, am I right?!   Boy, am I glad I made that decision! The chicken was incredibly flavorful and juicy. I let my friend try some too, and he legitimately started tearing up from how juicy, tender, and delicious it was! The waffles are also made with rosemary, making for a unique spin on a usually pretty standard part of the dish. My friend ordered the Southern Benedict, which he said was great, as well. In addition to our dishes, we ordered the Freedom 75 and Gentleman's Breakfast cocktails, but I think the food is really what's worth writing home about here!  Overall, I had a delicious meal and could see myself coming back here again in the future. Definitely recommend checking this place out :)"}
{"text":"Coming from the south I was super skeptical about this place. But I was surprised. The green tomatoes where amazing I crave those so frequently the sauce and the corn on top yumm. The meat was good but not amazing and an interesting drink selection. A little pricey and small potions for southern comfort food but definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much for some reason. The food was awesome though! I had the late night style chicken, but next time will go for the chicken and waffles. The low country boil also looked really good."}
{"text":"I had some apprehension trying this joint because I generally don't care for southern style food with only a few exceptions.  SOHO is a bit different because of the modern spin on classic southern food. This wasn't a long visit but I tried a few things and for the most part it was really enjoyable.    They are rockin a serious bourbon menu - many I've never even heard of.  Tried a cocktail first, it wasn't bad, but stick with bourbon here would be my suggestion.  They have one for any pallet.   They bring biscuits with apple jam and some herb butter like any other joint would bring bread - I really liked this spin on a restaurant freebie.  It was a great flaky biscuit; I preferred the butter.    We also snacked on the poutine...which was gigantic and the fries were far better than I was expecting.  A lot of poutines have these weak fries that try to make up for it by slathering gravy all over it.  Not here...the fries were crispy and could hold up to the gravy, which was just a complement to the dish.  This thing was loaded with all types of goodies too, which I liked just about all of them.    If you are looking for something a bit different in Ohio city this might be your place."}
{"text":"Now I must say this is a gem on W. 25th. They now have specials every week. The fried shrimp and oysters were the best! Not fried too hard, just right. Great beer selection. Great service and good deals on the specials! Great fried chicken. And the deviled eggs are a must! My new go to place!"}
{"text":"Really, really good. Lovely decor, nice clientele, friendly servers.  Had dinner there. The deviled eggs-6 of them, were amazing.  The homemade potato chips and pimento cheese dip--huge and even better. My fried chicken and waffles was good, but I would have put some greens on the plate. No room for dessert.  Thanks Soho for a fun evening."}
{"text":"This place was pretty amazing. I came in on a whim and they knocked it out the park. I got the Late-Night Style S'UTHERN FRIED CHICKEN With the Smoked Gouda Mac 'n' Cheese with  the Mashed Potato's. Everything was good and at a fair price.The only gripe i can say was I didn't care for the gravy but the food was so good I did not need it. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who looking for some southern style food with a modern twist head to SOHO."}
{"text":"Soho is just what I needed to ease my southern lovin' soul. I made reservations for 7:30 on a Saturday night, and good thing! This place was packed. Service was fantastic and it was a perfect dining experience all around.   Here's what I put in my body:  Biscuits and butter and jam: Biscuits are the best way to start a meal. The biscuits here are plump, and served warm with rosemary butter and jam. I could have just stopped here and I would have been perfectly satisfied. These things are out of this world good. BUT it's not a real meal unless you're uncomfortably stuffed AmIRight?   The Birmingham: Made with Vodka, Asian pear, rosemary-clove syrup, and lemon sour. Such an interesting drink (the good kind of interesting). Tart and refreshing.   Mac & Cheese: So decadent with smoked gouda as the star. I could run away with this dish. I could live off of this dish. I could raise my children with this dish. It's that amazing.   Jalape√±o hush puppies: I've never met a hush puppy I didn't like, but these were particularly good. I was hoping for a little more spice from the jalape√±o, though.   Chicken and waffles: Rosemary herbed waffles, where have you been all of my life?! Wow! Such a great compliment to the perfectly crispy, juicy, tender, buttermilked, battered, and boneless chicken. I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this meal.   Don't forget to grab one or two (or seven) complimentary Charleston Chews on your way out the door."}
{"text":"Very pretty space, good service, but the food is pretty average, if not fairly bland and uninventive, in my opinion.  I'm not going to go all \"I'm from the South\" on you in this review, but, well, I'm from the South and this is not really a close approximation of what you'd get in a good Southern restaurant. It's kind of southern in name only.  For example, our table started with the pimento cheese, which is a sandwich staple down south. You eat it on bread. At SOHO the pimento cheese is served as a dip, which is different but fine. But here it's served with the restaurant's homemade chips, which are not necessarily conduicive for scooping up the pimento cheese, which is a pretty firm and hearty spread. I would have gone with crunchy toast points instead, or maybe crudite.   It was also bland, something that I didn't really put my finger on until after our meal: I couldn't remember seeing any actual pimentos in the spread. That is the point of pimento cheese, you guys, the pimentos. I might be misremembering but honestly can't recall seeing diced pimentos.  I ordered the shrimp & grits for my entree. I found it to be way overpriced ($17) for what was plated -- basically a larger cereal bowl with grits and three or four scampi. Not worth it.  Didn't try any of the cocktails, but they look interesting -- and I've heard good things about them."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my food!  Such a gem in Ohio City.  I'm getting the chicken and waffles next time."}
{"text":"Wow! The food is great! I had the bird on a bun with pepper jelly and it was phenomenal! The hush puppies were ok-a little wet but great flavor (I wouldn't call them hush puppies though) the fried green tomatoes were awesome! The biscuits with rosemary butter and apple butter were also great! The pigs in a blanket were amazing-the BBQ beans were the best I have ever had! The pimento cheese was the great! Our server is super nice and very accommodating!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch around 1:00 and the place was very quiet - it started to pick up more toward the end of our meal, but we were surprised to see so few dining there on a holiday for many. I liked the feel of the place and noticed an outdoor eating area - we would definitely come back when the weather gets warmer so we can dine in the sun!  I never order cocktails at restaurants and usually stick to water or iced tea, but I decided to go crazy and try the Coral Gables - it was delicious and not overly sweet. Yum. My husband had a beer. They had an interesting cocktail list and a really nice assortment of specialty sodas/lemonades. I would probably try one of those next time since I am not a big drinker.  The food...(I am a vegetarian and husband is not)  The biscuits were delicious and we really liked the butter and preserves to spread on top. Too bad it was only one biscuit per person - I could have eaten another one, but didn't want to ask with our food coming. (Um, I also had some Campbell's Cupcakes sitting in my car, so you know.)  I started with the Ruby Cado salad which was spinach, avocado, blood orange, almonds, and a light dressing. It was really tasty and a decent portion for the $7 price tag. My husband and I split the Smoked Gouda Mac n Cheese, which was a great portion for $5.50 - it was a really good macaroni and cheese and we both liked it a lot. My husband had the Pork Bun ($10) that came with homemade chips - he said it was really good. I had the Sweet Potato Ravioli ($12) which was awesome - it had greens (could have been more for us veg people!), goat cheese, pecans, and cranberries on top. The portion was decent for lunch, but I think the price was a little high on this one.   When we looked at the menu online, they had several vegetarian options that sounded really good, but at lunch there was only really one veg entree option (unless you did soup or salad or an app). It would have been nice to have a couple more options during lunch time...especially on Good Friday when many do not eat meat anyway!   Overall, we were really happy with our first experience here and we would definitely come back - for lunch or brunch. The dinner prices are a little steep. It was a great little place I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"We stopped here for brunch on a Saturday when we went to Cleveland for the weekend to see a cavs game. It's in the brewery district (I think) and next to a farmers market (I forget the name) so trying to find parking in the area was almost impossible. We got lucky and found a spot fairly quickly, whereas our friends didn't have such luck...  My fianc√© and I arrived inside first, and were seated promptly as I had made a reservation (although there wouldn't have been much of a wait I don't think). The restaurant was fairly full, but there wasn't anyone waiting for a table. We ordered some fun brunch drinks while we waited for our friends to park. If you're a fan of Bloody Mary - must order the \"stuck pig\" with the beef jerky straw. My fianc√© loved it. I got the mimosa with grapefruit juice and enjoyed it.   Unfortunately I was not hungry at all, so I didn't exactly order a brunch dish and opted for a couple of sides to share. Went with deviled eggs and the hush puppies. The deviled eggs were good, had bacon in them if I remember correctly. And anything with bacon is just automatically delicious lol. I did not like the hush puppies at all. They were supposed to be jalape√±o ones but they had no flavor. Even dipping them in the creamy sauce didn't make them delicious. Definitely a nay on that one. There were complimentary biscuits and some fancy flavored butter and jam, which was nice.   My fianc√© ordered the biscuits and gravy with extra gravy. He liked it but was not impressed by any means. His favorite ones are from his cousins house down in Alabama, so he knows his biscuits and gravy! My friend ordered the shrimp and grits and liked it, but also didn't think it was anything special. Her husband ordered the s'uthern Benedict which he also enjoyed, but then again - nothing to rave about. Perhaps we've just all been too spoiled by all the good food that's here in Buffalo that not much really \"impresses\" us anymore? Idk.   All in all, average food, good service, and yummy drinks. Perhaps a little overpriced but considering the location and the crowd that it caters to, I suppose that's just the norm nowadays."}
{"text":"Amazing menu but more importantly, amazing ownership and staff! Our favorite restaurant, bar none."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch a couple weekends ago. Very cool place with great food and great drinks! We had a reservation for 11am and there were plenty of tables so we were seated quickly, by the end of our meal it got pretty busy so I would advise having a reservation or getting there a little early.  I got the Chicken and Waffles for food & the Gentleman's Breakfast drink. Both were quite tasty! The biscuits and jam before the meal were incredible. There was a mishap of my chicken being a bit undercooked initially. However, I still give Soho a 5 star review because they got my order fixed quite quickly and the waitress was courteous about the situation. Overall, a great experience and will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"So I'm writing this review over a month late, but I think that speaks to how good the chicken was it's still on my mind. I stopped in for a brunch with 3 of my friends with no reservations and got a seat immediately even though it was busy and there were several large parties. The owner herself took care of us because our server was handling separate checks for a large group. My friend has a gluten and dairy allergy and found multiple things on the menu she could eat! They even have gluten free batter for the fried chicken! When her plate came out she actually asked again if it was gluten free because she didn't believe how good it was! I ordered the chicken and waffles and a Bloody Mary. The chicken was AMAZING! Literally melt in your mouth chicken the rosemary waffles were yum and added another flavor to the dish. The bloody was sooo good too. I am still dreaming of this meal and can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"This was my go-to brunch spot. The deviled eggs have scarred me for life; I can't have them anywhere else. If you're looking for light and healthy, you chose the wrong spot. If you are craving something filling and juicy, hit this spot up before heading next door for ice cream. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Every Friday, my co workers and I try a different Cleveland restaurant. We have had a lot of amazing food and some not so amazing food. I am not one to typically write a review but SOHO is by far, my favorite place yet.  I had the Fried Green tomaters and the pork bun. Both were amazing. I can never pass up fried Green tomatoes if they are available, so all though this was a lot of food for a Friday lunch, I had to divulge. They were delicious! My co-workers had the Fried chicken and they were equally impressed.  I don't want to leave out the yummy biscuits that they start you with as well. I have been to some of the other places around SOHO as well and have yet to be impressed, this place was fantastic."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Overall enjoyed it, but didn't love it. Tried the black Russian for a drink which I liked a lot. For food had deviled eggs and the southern eggs Benedict. Definitely a hearty breakfast...for all those calories wish I liked it a bit more.  Great service.  Food unfort just average."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday for Brunch. It wasn't awful. Just wasn't great either. Their version of the Bloody Mary was maybe the worst I've ever had. Don't get it. Nice selection of whiskey and bourbon but pretty wasn't blown away by the food or drinks."}
{"text":"The hot sauce alone is worth the trip. The chicken is very good. If you love fried chicken dosed in hot sauce this is the place. Drinks are decent as well but not the star of the show."}
{"text":"We were great with the best smell when we walked in for brunch today!!! I ordered the Bloody Mary and was given a small one and charged for the big one. Didn't even care because it was so good. I had the hush puppies with sausage gravy and husband had the chicken and waffle. OMG! The food here is amazingly flavorful. Our friends had the chicken cordon blue and it was the best presentation plate of the table. We are in silence due to the food being so good. Do yourself a favor and eat all the food."}
{"text":"Great chicken and pickles! Get a few Charleston Chew to munch on while you wait for your food! Biscuits we're also amazing! They have a great (and cheap) a la carte menu on Wednesday -- I strongly recommend it. Their patio is small but has a nice picnic theme. Overall a strong recommend!!"}
{"text":"We went here yesterday after the St. Malachai run--a pretty impromptu decision.  Wow, am I glad we did!  I had the avocado toast, which I will be dreaming about (and trying to recreate at home); hubs had the shrimp and grits--fab; and the kids split steak and eggs along with an order of fresh-made beignets.  Mmm-mmmm!!!  So delish."}
{"text":"I love SOHO so much, I'm updating my review to talk about their Chicken Scratch Wednesday deal.  Buy individual pieces of amazing fried chicken (I require just one breast) and sides (I go for mac&cheese and asparagus). Boyfriend buys two pieces'o'chicken. Without drinks, we're out of their for about $20 plus tip. Not too shabby for a romantic dinner out. Service is extraordinarily good. Never a bad experience with anyone. Everything I've had is top notch. This is one of the top restaurants in NEO, handsdown."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles and whiskey coffee is TO DIE FOR! One of my favorite spots in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great apps (deviled eggs and jalapeno hushpuppies - amazeballs) , great whiskey/scotch menu, great chicken (perfectly crispy and seasoned), great low-country boil.  Loved the added touches of the fluffy biscuits with butter and jam.  Kevin was extremely knowledgeable about the whiskeys, made great recos."}
{"text":"LOVE SOHO! Trendy, craft drinks so yum , southern food even this veggie head can enjoy but my husband and son are scarfing down the fried chicken- best they have ever had. Biscuits, dessert, don't even get me started on the fried green tomoates- amazeballs!!!"}
{"text":"After years of talking about it, I finally got around to visiting SoHo for the very first time. I have to say, their sides are absolute delicious and the same goes for the complimentary biscuits you receive before the meal. I swear, I could down 3 or 4 of those puppies with no problem. My only issue with the place was the fried chicken. While I love their crispy coating, when I took my first bite the entire thing came apart. I'm not sure if it was just the batch I got or if that's a normal problem, but the batter didn't adhere to the chicken at all. So, I was forced to take bites of chicken and then pick a piece off my plate.   Prices are $1 or so too steep too. But, I'm sure I'll be visiting them again at some point. I need more biscuits."}
{"text":"Went for Fat Tuesday celebration. Had several good drink specials, and menu items especially for the day. Oyster po boy was alright, but have had better. Deviled eggs, bacon wrapped andouille, and the oysters Rockefeller where all very good. Great service and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  The fried chicken was out of this world.  Seriously the best fried chicken I've ever had.  If you come here, you have to try the fried chicken.  This came with rosemary waffles which sounds weird, but a great combination with the awesome fried chicken.  My wife had the shrimp and grits which were great, but not as great as my fried chicken.  I highly recommend the fried chicken."}
{"text":"A coworker and I are in Cleveland for work and we wanted a solid meal but in a casual setting and not too pricy ! We stumbled upon this terrific country style restaurant and were not at all disappointed ! On Wednesday nights they do chicken night - which basically allows you to pick a portion (or portions) of friend chicken - regular or spicy - charged very reasonably by the piece ($1.50-$5 or so) and then pick sides also a bargain ($3.50 per) including grilled asparagus, Mac and cheese, savory waffles and syrup (for the chicken !) and then chow down ! Well many chicken parts later we were full, and making room for their terrific desserts - pie w bourbon ice cream and fried donuts and a dipping sauce. Service was nice, folks couldn't have been nicer and  my dinner colleague and I were sure that we would be regulars if the commute from CT and SF wasn't so long ! Go and eat well here and start that damn diet tomorrow !!"}
{"text":"I LOVE SOHO! A co-worker raved about SOHO's cozy interior and their phenomenal food. He and his girlfriend both work in the industry so I trusted his recommendation and was eager to get there.  After a sub-par, non fulfilling dining experience elsewhere on West 25th last week my boyfriend and I ventured past SOHO. We decided what the heck? Why not get a drink? We peeked in and immediately were taken. It is so chic and cozy inside. The lighting is dim yet inviting. It is primarily wood which gives it a rustic, southern look. There are tables however, I'm a bar person.   The first time we went we got drinks and ended up ordering an appetizer. The menu looked so good we had to try SOMETHING. We ordered the clams casino and were both surprised when they gave us biscuits first. The biscuits come with an apple jam and some sort of delicious butter. Whatever they were they were delicious and I ended up enjoying a spoon of apple jam! Oops! The Clams were OK. I wouldn't say they were great and I probably wouldn't order them again.   I went again last night for dinner - I vowed after my experience I would write a yelp review. It was fantastic from start to finish. I drank the menu drink with Bourbon, the name escapes me. It's delicious. As is their general selection of whiskeys and bourbons.It is HUGE! I started with the Farmer's Daughter salad which was bibb lettuce topped with avocado, pickled red onion, cucumbers, green beans, and a rich yet not overpowering buttermilk dressing. The pickled red onions alone are a reason for me to order the salad again. They gave it such a unique flavor and added crunch. The green beans were a little overpowering so I took off about half. Very very enjoyable salad.   We split the Oyster appetizer. I was a little nervous after the clams casino that is would under-impress me --- and was I wrong. It was quite the opposite. They were phenomenal. They were hot, juicy, flavorful. For dinner we obviously had to go with the fried chicken. We got two different styles: Evenin Style and Late Night style. Evening style comes with Mashed Potatoes and Collard Greens whereas the Late Night Style comes with Mac'n'Cheese and JoJo's. I got the late night. My boyfriend got the Evening and he LOVED it. The mashed potatoes were really great as was the gravy. They both tasted homemade and were very savory. The only reason I would say I didn't love mine is the chicken.  Mine was pretty dry. And the JoJo's were REALLY greasy. Everything was good, don't get me wrong. It just could have been better. The mac'n'cheese, however, was fantastic! I loved that --- I barely shared.   After dinner we finished up our drinks and talked to the bartender who ended up being the owner! He was talking about some of the hard to find bourbons and let us try one of them! It was great and a nice gesture. His wife (who is also the co-owner) was there as well. He introduced all of us and we gabbed for a few minutes before paying our tabs and heading elsewhere. Great time, great drinks, great food. Plus, the owners added that special touch by being present and being so nice! I would recommend SOHO to everyone and I will!!"}
{"text":"Best brunch on West 25th.  Their fried chicken and waffles is the tits and they have quite the list of whiskey to choose from.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This was our second second visit here.    On our first visit our party was two, this time three.    The booze  First we ordered cocktails. I got the one of their \"signature\" drinks.   One hesitates to complain because, they are generous with the alcohol component in their drinks, but while creativity behind the bar is a welcome plus, creativity isn't necessarily meritorious in and of itself.  The name of my drink escapes me, but it had a branch of rosemary stuck in it as a flavor-infused swizzle stick along with cucumber and mint; rather than the symphony of flavors for which I'm certain they strove, it was more a cacophony of flavors.  Each flavor just strongly presented itself to the palate without due consideration to how it would taste with all of it's fellow components.  The resulting flavor fell somewhere between bad dollar store mouthwash and bad dollar store liquid cold medication.   Great if you're under the weather and have bad breath, not so much if you're not. Of our other two diners, one enjoyed their signature drink, the other did not, (none were duplicates.)   The apps  We got an order of the Jalapeno hush-puppies and a bowl of the duck gumbo. The puppies were rather standard fare, very dense,  like their biscuits that seem to get acclaim from most diners.  They also weren't discernibly (spicy) hot , but that might have been a function of the pepper, not the chef, but hey that's what the chef's taste-buds are for, aren't they ,(taste as your cook)?  The gumbo was perfect.   The duck was shredded, so I'm assuming dark meat was employed.  Not greasy in the least, and the gumbo overall was perfectly seasoned, enough bite that one knew it as Cajun, but not so much that the essence of the non-seasoning components was lost on the diner.  The entrees   Having had the most perfectly cooked shrimp in a lifetime at my last visit vis a vis the shrimp and grits, my hand, I and the one of my companions who had tasted mine during our prior visit were forced and we both ordered it again on this occasion. The other diner got a rib-eye steak which was accompanied by whipped butternut squash and green beans.  Each item on her plate had a twist to it's preparation, and each was met with effusive praise by the diner.  The shrimp and grits was superior, but didn't quite reach the level of \"exquisite\" that served at our previous visit; hence the four star rating afforded at this visit."}
{"text":"What an amazing meal for my mouth! Dined here with my husband and another couple and everyone loved their meal! Johnny cakes and fried green tomatoes as starters were amazing! Shrimp and grits were outstanding and the late night and morning style chicken were great as well! Friend loved the tomato bisque and cranberry salad! The service was top notch! The only negative thing I can say is the New Orleans drink was terrible - no flavor or taste just felt like I was drinking rubbing alcohol! Overall, an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Good southern food and a classy bar. They have the best chicken & waffles in town and they serve them 3 different ways. The brunch is also good, your bloody Mary straw is a slim Jim with a hole in it. It can get pricey if you stick around and have a few drinks"}
{"text":"BRUNCH was delish!!! I came here last year for the first time on 09 December 2017 and I seriously need to go back.   I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and mimosa drink. YUM, YUM, Yuuuummmm. And oh, the biscuits and jam that they bring out to your table as a starter item is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Just soooooo delish. I just don't know how else to describe the food because I left feeling so satisfied. The chicken was literally melting off the bone and the waffles were sweet and perfect. DANG, now I really want to come her again tomorrow. Service is amazing too.  SAY yes to this place people. Just say YES!!   P.S. my friends and I got here around 11am and we were seated right away. I'm sure this spot probably gets packed on weekends because it was pretty full when we arrived so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"We arrived at 8pm on a Friday night in July. The patio was mostly full but we were seated outside right away. Inside was empty. All we ordered were cocktails, hush puppy appetizers and salads. The cocktails were weak, the hush puppies were nearly burnt and the salads did not arrive until 9:30. That's a 90 minute wait for salads. One was the rice salad (rizi pizi?) and it was really salty. REALY salty. The server apologized and gave us one of them for free but we won't be back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Don't get me wrong. After thinking about this place for a while, I went from 4 stars to 3.5 stars.  It's a cute restaurant. Definitely a more classy environment than what I expected. But for a Southern restaurant, I kind of expect....more of it to be really Southern.  I liked the food, no doubt. But the portions were small.... not typical of Southern food. On to the food....  We came here on Sunday for brunch. It was cute in the beginning- they give you these small little butter biscuits to munch on...but man, they were small. And not replenished.  I ordered the benedict, per the waiter's opinion. I mean, the sauce was good, and it was good..just the ham was way too salty. Like crazy salty. My friends ordered the skillet (which looked the most worth its price) and the biscuits and gravy.  I mean, the decor is cool and inviting. And hip. But the food..iono, I've been to the South and to Southern restaurants...and I feel that Soho is slightly false advertisement of what Soho means. Nonetheless, if you're looking for a place for a more classier brunch with small portions, definitely check out Soho...."}
{"text":"Been here twice, once for Valentine's dinner and once for brunch. Great seating for Saturday brunch - very little people in the restaurant on a Saturday. Service is good, but could be better - could have done with a little bit more attention to get our orders in on that empty Saturday brunch time. Nonetheless, food is great, although my boyfriend would tell you otherwise.   Food: - Complimentary biscuits: these are so yummy, flaky, I love the jam and butter that comes with it. - Fried green tomatoes: went here with boyfriend and his friends, they felt this sounded strange. I thought it was classic Southern cuisine? Who knows? Anyways, this was the hit both during brunch and during dinner. Amazing.  - House made pimento cheese dip: A lot of dip. I would avoid this one as I thought the chips were kind of bitter, maybe over fried? Pimento cheese dip is good, but they're also on some of the other dishes, and it was just a  redundant dish. Chips do taste good with the hot sauce they have there. - Chicken morning-style: Chicken is sooooo succulent. Tastes really good dipped in the maple syrup. Waffles was really oily though.  - Chicken late-night style: Again, chicken is delicious. Succulent, moist without the heaviness of being drenched with oil. Don't remember much about the other sides it came with though... - Slow roasted pork bun: Boyfriend loved this the first time he got it - said it was really fresh, clean, flavorful. Second time was a little too vinegary. I thought it was ok, could have used more filling to bun ratio. - Pecan pie: yummy. Boyfriend who normally does not like pies ate this up as well.  Portion size is generous. Had enough for leftovers.   Would come here again, maybe for the Wed happy hour next time."}
{"text":"SOHO offers an amazing chicken scratch every Wednesday night. I highly recommend it. SOHO is right on W. 25th and has a very cute patio, great for people watching in the summer.  The inside is quaint and very modern, southern looking. When you order, you do get some delicious biscuits with homemade butter and a fresh jelly- who doesn't love biscuits pre-meal? I love the fried chicken, however if you are not a huge fan of spicy food, I recommend sticking with the regular fried chicken. In my opinion, the spicy fried chicken is overwhelming. For drinks, the hurricane is absolutely phenomenal and they offer a pretty good variety of whiskey drinks as well. The brunch here is also very delicious. I recommend the Stuck Pig- their version of a Bloody Mary. The service is great and the staff is very friendly and attentive. Overall, SOHO brings a fantastic meal and a great atmosphere to West 25th."}
{"text":"So happy my boyfriend and I checked out Soho. I love when a restaurant sticks to what they know. The chicken here is divine. You can pair it with a range of sides - Mac and cheese, collard greens, rosemary waffles, and so much more.   We have also had amazing service every time we've stopped by. The hostess seats us right away (surely having a reservation helps), our water glasses are never empty, and biscuits and jam arrive expeditiously.   Soho isn't too loud even when all the tables are full and there are a couple TVs near the bar so if you need to watch a sports game it's possible to keep an eye on the screen. Even still, the atmosphere manages to be both causal and romantic.   I haven't tried any cocktails yet but the bar is well stocked so I'm sure more deliciousness awaits. Looking forward to working my way through the rest of the menu very soon."}
{"text":"An Ohio City gem! Such a breathe of fresh air being a Cleveland transplant from the South.Love this place so much"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Love the atmosphere and the biscuits and jelly. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday on a Thursday night. Only a few people in the place, next to my large group. Very relaxing vibe, candles lit at table. Awesome assortment of southern named cocktails. Hot biscuits are served which were delicious! Felt like Bob Evans, in a good way. Had the hush puppies for an app which were huge, and the late night fried chicken option that came with bacon Mac n cheese. Glad I shared everything because portions were very large! Service on the slower side but had a fantastic experience. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"We came here for a late brunch after a three mile run in edgewater park. The Southern Benedict was awesome, it was what I want after my run!"}
{"text":"So, I tried a couple weeks ago to come to this restaurant and learned that you should have reservations on weekends.   Anyways, we did make reservations for my husband's birthday.   It was amazing and worth the wait.  The ambiance/decor is my favorite for a restaurant.... industrial with wood and metal.  There is a very cool laser cut art on the wall that catches your eye as we walk in.    The menu is smallish (but expected for the type of restaurant), but there is still a decent amount of choices.     I got the chicken... because I feel like you should try the chicken when it is in the title.   It was far from dry with amazing BBQ sauce and hot sauce (which was great).   I also tried the mac and cheese (honestly, who can say no to Gouda mac and cheese) and collard greens.   My husband got the low country boil and said it was very good.   We also tried the hushpuppies and my husband got a drink.     The service was outstanding and the food came out perfectly timed.  This may be one of my favorite restaurants since moving to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Fantastic fried chicken! I went to SOHO for the first time this weekend and was blown away at the quality of the fried chicken. It was deliciously juicy, with a light but crispy crust on the outside that was complimented by delicious sides. For a savory option I recommend the \"Evenin'\" and for a sweet option I recommend the \"Mornin'\" (chicken and waffles like you've never had). Service was great, we had a really friendly gentleman who was attentive the whole time we were there. They have a great little list of happy hour snacks and drinks!"}
{"text":"I feel like I need to update my review.  On Wednesday, they do a Chicken Scratch special.  Basically they offer various pieces of fried chicken (regular or spicy) for between $2-4.50 and discounted sides.  The spicy chicken. Oh man. Just go there and try it. It is perfectly crispy and spicy and so good.  I don't know how to convince you, but seriously, if you like fried chicken, go. It's worth $10 to give it a try.  If you make it before happy hour, you can get cheap drinks, too.  It's a delicious, budget friendly Wednesday!"}
{"text":"I went here on a wednesday evening for dinner. It is a moderately smaller upscale restaurant. They have an outdoor dining as well and high tables that looks outside. The service was very good. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Before you order your dinner you get a complimentary biscuits. It was very soft,flaky, and warm! I had really high hopes for the dinner! I ordered the hot fried chicken with fries, coleslaw, and pickles. I recommend coming here on a wednesday night if you want to try out the food for a good price! A la carte Wednesday is where you get to pick pieces of chicken from thighs to breast to drumstick or a whole wing! You can also get tofu chicken! Then you get to choose multiple different sides! My chicken came out looking delicious but I wish it was delicious as it looked! I got it hot and it had no heat to it in my opinion! The flavor of the crust was very thick and dry! The chicken itself was very bland! Personally I prefer things with flavors and spices and I was hoping it to be! The fries were very plain and the coleslaw was too creamy. I like my coleslaw to be a little more vinegary! The pickles were very good and I think out of my whole meal that is the only thing I liked. This review is based on the food and personally I didn't like it  to my preference. The atmosphere is great and the service is excellent!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from San Francisco and consider ourselves quite the foodies.  Being from Cleveland originally, I know that Clevelanders do food and beer better than most, but I never expected anything this good!   Every person in Cleveland should be flocking to this restaurant.  It is absolutely one of the best food experiences I've had - hands down.  We walked in from a rain storm in the middle of the summer so we were covered in sweat and rain - on a Friday night without reservations and were immediately sat at a great table near the window.    The entire menu is incredibly thoughtful.  Our drinks were DELICIOUS - bourbon based yumminess that some mixology genius came up with.   Our appetizer:  Lamb Belly.  This is a perfect example of how this place avoids the obvious and goes for the throat with clever takes on traditional faire.  I am not a pork fan, so I was so excited to try this dish and it didn't disappoint.  Crispy, fatty, covered in greens - it melted in your mouth.  My partner and I could have easily taken our straws and snorted it up our noses like coke.  Amazing!  Our main courses consisted of a crab crusted trout (me) and the steamed seafood (him).  Each had interesting accompaniments - like succotash and mint for mine, which was delicious.    We split a vanilla pudding with thin wafers and cream - which was the perfect way to end the night.    In addition, the staff, atmosphere, and prices were amazing.  We will be back anytime we're visiting.  If you live in Cleveland or anywhere in NE Ohio - do yourself and this wonderful Ohio City community a favor and support this place!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love the fried chicken here. I'm all about making sure the breading is nice a crispy yet has flavor and Soho has nailed it. We went here for happy hour on Wednesday. I would recommend coming on this day because that's when they have a special on their chicken by the piece. I got a breast for only $5 and the sides varied from $3 to $5 dollars. I would recommend getting the collard greens and the mac and cheese with the yam and bacon. We also got the cheesy grits and the mashed potatoes with gravy. I wasn't a fan of the gravy because it was a little bland in my opinion but the cheesy grits were pretty good. Some of the happy hour specials included $3 beers, bulliet bourbon for $3, and two different cocktails for $5. My boyfriend had one of the cocktails that tasted much like an orange creamsicle. It was light and refreshing and would be perfect for the summertime when its humid outside. If you looking for a new happy hour spot to try I would check this place out."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Cleveland. Come on Wednesday night when it is a la carte. Try the hot. It is better than Bonchon Korean fried chicken. The meat falls off the bone, is tender with a perfectly crispy outside. The big breast piece is also great. Mac and cheese and asparagus round off the list of sides for a great meal. The happy hour is pretty good too. I will be eating here a lot more."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles are a group favorite! We come here every other month for brunch! The cheesy grits are an amazing side dish. Great service and fun cocktails. Go! But make reservations!"}
{"text":"Soho is top tier cuisine. The Chicken and Waffles could truely not be any better. Twice I've been impressed. Staff is polite even during rushes, and leave you to eating and conversation. Top 5 favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"I would have given 4 stars but the namesake is chicken and that was the only thing that wasn't good. I really wanted to like this place too. The service we good the atmosphere was nice, albeit very trendy.   We came for lunch but got brunch since that's what they serve at noon on Saturday. I ordered the chicken and waffles since that's what they seem to be all about. My friend ordered the hash which apparently was delicious. We also had biscuits and deviled eggs which were both delicious.   Unfortunately I have to complain about the chicken. It came with two pieces of chicken. One boneless thigh and one boneless breast. The waffles were also very good, and the thigh was fine, but that breast was probably the chewiest piece of chicken I've ever had. I'm not exaggerating it was like bubble gum.  I hate to give out bad reviews and I wouldn't have, had this been just one poorly executed dish but chicken is the name of the place. It should have been a better piece of fried chicken."}
{"text":"My friends had been talking about this restaurant for months. And to be honest I did not know if it was worth all of the hype. But, my friends were right SoHo is amazing.   To begin with Soho provides you with a biscuit and a mixuture of their own jam and butter, both of which are excellent. Second, Soho has great chicken dishes. My favorite is the bird on the bun. What really makes this dish stand out is the pimento cheese. I would also suggest the pimento cheese appetizer, as well.   Beyond the food, the staff is friendly and helpful even when the restaurant is busy. To be honest I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great biscuits, although we had a slight, ahem, mishap with our bitter last night. Ordered a variety of dishes and each was great! I had raw oysters and oysters Rockefeller- sooo good. My fianc√© had the shrimp and grits- always a hit. The grits are perfect with the fresh corn and some hot sauce! Our friends ordered the chicken n waffles, tomato bisque and farmers's salad. Everyone seemed happy with their dish, but perhaps there should be a white meat only option for the chicken options?  Will be back- hopefully for the brunch!!"}
{"text":"Very unique place. Dinner came with freshly made biscuit. The fried chicken was very good quality, not fried with old oil like most places. The mac and cheese and greens were very well balanced."}
{"text":"One of the better brunches in town!!!!!!!!!! I enjoyed eggs Benny which was served on a fried green tomato! SO delicious. Great service! It was very busy and yet our bartender was very tentative, upbeat and personable.  Service is a big deal to me because if the food is just average at a place, but the service is top notch...I will go back EVERYTIME!   Thanks Black Pig! Super all around!"}
{"text":"Never heard of this previously but tried it on a whim. SOHO exceeded my expectations! The service was spot on and the food was unlike anything I've ever had. Would recommend the lamb belly appetizer. I have a feeling anything on the menu would explode your palate. Rosemary waffles are also a plus! Will see you again very soon SOHO!"}
{"text":"After walking around West Side Market and grabbing some drinks at Great Lakes Brewing Co. my boyfriend and I decided to stop at SoHo and eat.  The food was amazing!  We went around 5:15 and the place wasn't too crowded.  It has a very nice atmosphere with dim lighting and rustic decor.  For an appetizer we got the Jalape√±o Hush Puppies, they were delicious.  Not too spicy and the dipping sauce that came with them added a little something extra.   For dinner, I got the shrimp and grits and my boyfriend got the fried chicken - evening style (it came with mashed potatoes and gravy with collard greens).  The shrimp and grits was amazing and so flavorful.  It also came with asparagus, corn, and andouille sausage which gave it some extra flavor.  There was also a lot of shrimp so I felt like I really got my moneys worth.  The fried chicken my boyfriend got was also incredible.  The crispy coating melted in your mouth and the chicken was super moist and flavorful.  The mashed potatoes and gravy was also heavenly.  It looked like the gravy had little pieces of carrot and some other veggies in it which gave it another level of flavor.  I'm a huge fan of collard greens so I was excited to try them but they were way too spicy for me.  That is really the only downside from the meal.  The menu here was rather small, but I feel like the flavor of the food they did have, made up for this.  The reason I gave this 4/5 stars was because when we walked in there was no hostess, we were left standing there wondering what to do.  My boyfriend ended up walking to the bar to get someones attention to seat us.  The wait for our food was also a little long, but nothing too bad.  I highly recommend that anyone in the area try out this delicious food."}
{"text":"I went here on a Wednesday for their Finger Lickin Chicken specials that are all say on Wednesdays. I heard that SOHO made their mark with their infamous fried chicken so I had to try it! The chicken pieces are a la carte. You can get a chicken breast for $4.50, thigh $3.50, and it's even cheaper for the drumstick or wing! You have a choice of mild or spicy, and the side dishes are $3.50 (smoked Gouda mac n cheese, spicy collard greens, waffles, mashed potatoes and gravy and more!).  Now let's get to the meat of this review. The chicken was definitely finger lickin' good! I got the spicy chicken thigh. It was probably a little bit bigger than my fist when it arrived with a side of spicy collard greens. I instantly thought for sure there was a bone in it. As I cut into it and took my first bite, it was so juicy and flavorful! The breading was so delicious that I went in for the kill. I took my knife to it a few more times in search of the bone just to realize... There was no bone! OMG... This is just a big piece of perfectly fried delicious chicken! Wow... I'm speechless... Maybe it's because my mouth was completely stuffed with chicken and collard greens. But I devoured every piece, crumb and juice of it! Yum!!!  If this review was for the chicken, it would get 5 stars. However, the review is on the restaurant. Where they lost a star is the service. The service was slow... We waited over 20 minutes for the server to come back to our table to take our order, and it wasn't that busy in there like you might think! It also took the server awhile to come back to our table after we were all done eating to give us our checks. When she did finally give us our bill, she gave my friends another table's bill.  Now, I understand that service may not always be consistent for various reasons. Maybe they were just short-staffed or having a bad day. So I won't let this deter me from coming back to Finger Lickin' Chicken Wednesdays! I'll recommend it to anyone, and maybe I'll see you there!"}
{"text":"Has amazing fried chicken and one of the BEST bourbon selections in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is perfect- very crispy and the flavor of the coating is great. The bbq sauce on the side is just the right amount of sweet. The collard greens and mac and cheese that came with my dish (the \"Late Night\") were awesome as well. The pre-meal biscuits with jam and rosemary butter was 10/10.   I really enjoyed being in a restaurant where the music also isn't loud and you don't have to shout over one another to have a conversation. Friendly and timely service to top it off. Overall, an excellent place, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you want brunch, you want Soho Chicken + Whiskey.  If you don't want to wait upwards of an hour for a table of 2, you want to call ahead."}
{"text":"This place has good food, im not gonna lie. Prices. Sky high! They try and use their name to up their prices. I went for brunch one time with a few friends, I ordered the Chx N Waffles. It was nowhere near the portions XYZ has and close enough to double the price.   They bid and got an excellent property location and named it after a historical section of a historical, major city. Kudos. No reason to super, sky high jack up prices. Like I said though, the food quality is very good. Noone had a complaint, so if youre out and lookn to spend good money on pretty quality food. Heres the place."}
{"text":"4-  After an Android navigation snafu that took me to a clothing store called SOHO in Beachwood, I hightailed it back to Ohio City and was greeted by some great southern food and even better local company.    No appetizer for me, since I was late, but the Crawfish Fritters I sampled from my friend Jaime's plate were quite flavorful.  I didn't like my new friend Manoa's BBQ Chips w/ Cheddar Spread as much, but I think Manoa herself is super! :)  After much contemplation, the drink of choice was the very boozy \"New Orleans,\" a rye-absinthe-bitters combo that was surely strong, but sounded better on paper than it tasted.  Nevertheless, my Shrimp & Grits were heavenly.  I love me some grits, and this entree was pitch-perfect with giant rock shrimp, creamy grits, and a nice mish-mash of veggies.  I felt almost compelled to lick my dish clean."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Upscale comfort food served in a warm (just as comfortable) environment. I visited a couple Fridays ago with a group of co workers and I can't wait to go back! I'm a huge fan of chicken sandwiches so I had to go with the 'Bird on a Bun', naturally. It was fantastic and a surprisingly large portion, which was nice."}
{"text":"There were things that I liked about SOHO Kitchen and things that I didn't. Overall I'd say it was okay. Here are some of  the pros and cons in my humble opinion.  Interior - Great atmosphere with soft lighting and cool metallic art. I love the amount of wood used in the decor. It is a bit on the small side however and there really isn't any room to stand if you're waiting for a table.  Drinks - Absolutely delicious! My boyfriend and I each got a cocktail and I have no complaints on that front.  Staff - Super nice, quick and efficient. Top-notch!  Food - Delicious biscuits served with apple jelly and herb butter. I only wish they gave you more than one each they were so good! We ordered the lamb belly for an appetizer which was quite tasty. For an entr√©e I ordered the chicken \"late night style\" with mac n cheese and  JoJo fries. The mac n cheese and the fries were great, but I have to say I wasn't a fan of the chicken which I found disappointing as this is their specialty, apparently. I'm sure other people love it, but it just wasn't what I was expecting for southern fried chicken. It seemed more like a \"foodie\" version of it. The chicken itself was boneless which I found odd and it teetered toward the sweet rather than savory side. Overall it was rather bland. The BBQ sauce helped, but not much. I had my leftovers the following day and mixed up some General Tso's sauce with pineapple preserves which was much better. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits which he said was just okay. We were too full for dessert so I can't comment on that. I also didn't get why there are sides listed on the menu for an additional $5.50 when everything comes with its own sides. Is this in case you just want even more sides?  Overall, I'd say if I were to go there again (which I probably won't) I'd go just for the cocktails... and maybe some biscuits! If you're looking for real southern food, however, this isn't the place."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why we haven't visited this place before. This is southern food like no other! Plus, the hand crafted drinks are amazing. The staff is super friendly and attentive. I can't wait to come back and try the other menu items."}
{"text":"No class.   Brunch was good.  Limited options, but as I taste tested the other dishes of my party I know to order chicken and waffles in the future, if I ever decide to come back. The other dishes including my own were not worth the hype.   Server was great and after we finished we were enjoying our cocktails and the manager told us that there is a wait and we need to move along. We saw one party of 4 people waiting....maybe there was more that we didn't see but needless to say we were unhappy.   I've NEVER been asked to leave .. we took our money to another establishment and while I understand the need to flip tables you don't ask people to leave unless they have done something to deserve it or it is closing time."}
{"text":"We had date night here and it was great!  My SO and I went on a Thursday night during an Indians game, they have a tv (maybe two) at the bar but it was pretty empty, thank goodness.  We got our pick of seating, we chose one of the long booths.  We ordered 2 cocktails and the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer.  My SO was a little apprehensive at \"cheese curds\" as an ingredient but he enjoyed the appetizer anyway!  Our server didn't take our entree orders until we were well into our app.  I was concerned about how long they would take to come out, but it wasn't a terrible wait.  We had another round of cocktails to keep us busy.  I forgot to mention the biscuits with apple berry jam and rosemary butter than they bring out.  Soooo good and they taste homemade!  He ordered the Chicken dinner \"late night\" style with a breast and thigh. They have 5 different ways to serve it available.  He said the mac and cheese and collard greens were perfect and well seasoned.  The chicken had a batter that wasn't too thick and was fried crispy, the meat was juicy.  I had pointed out that he didn't use any hot sauce (which he uses at most meals) and he replied \"there's nothing to add to this.\" He's a black hole and couldn't even finish everything but was super excited for the leftovers!  I got the Lowcountry boil which was delicious.  For those who keep count, I only got 2 shrimp, but 4 crab claws.  I imagine they just scoop this out of a big pot, so everyone's serving may be different.  It was really tasty and I was glad for my \"soppin toast\" to soak up the beer broth.  I couldn't finish my meal either.  We inquired about dessert, but they only had beignets and pecan pie.  Neither of which interested me.  All in all service and food was spot on.  I'd recommend and go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Yum! I caught dinner here with a friend of mine per his suggestion and I'm so glad this was his choice. When we arrived, he said, \"They have a small menu. They do one thing, fried chicken, and they do it well.\" This response from my vegetarian friend perplexed me, but he then explained they also do fried tofu. How awesome!  He ordered the dinner fried tofu which came with mashed potato and veg. He offered me a bite of the fried tofu and it didn't disappoint. I ordered the late night which comes with collards and mac and cheese. I usually wouldn't order something with this pasta side, but I was feeling indulgent. Everything on my plate was astounding. The chicken was crispy, tender, and seasoned perfectly. The breading often separated from the meat, but it was still delicious. The bitterness of the collards paired well with the fatty, savory pork they are cooked with, and the mac and cheese was just as indulgent as I expected. I'm not sure the name of the pasta shape they used, but I liked how the cheese sauce coated it.   There were lots of other things to commend: my bourbon cocktail was strong yet balanced, the biscuits they brought out before the meal had golden, crispy edges, and the beignets we shared for dessert were dreamy with the chocolate and raspberry sauces.   This Isn't the type of food I would eat on a regular basis, but Soho is definitely on my list of places to check out again when I want some great fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Very awesome restaurant. The rolls with the Apple jam and salted butter are wonderful. The shrimp and grits meal is delicious. Be sure to ask for their house made hot sauce."}
{"text":"We went here last night before going to a show and all four of us loved it. The service was great and friendliness of the staff added to our great experience. From the pimento cheese with BBQ chips to the fried green tomatoes (the best I have ever had) to shrimp and grits, the presentation and tastes were beyond expectations. I am hooked and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. I went there on a date and had a great time. It has a relaxed and cool vibe. The menu is fairly limited, but very well done. I had the BLT with fried green tomatoes, homemade pub chips and an avocado and greenbean salad. Everything from the sandwich was fabulous. I recommend the beignets for dessert!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them 4.5 stars, but I can't.  They are closer to a 5 than a 4 so I gave them the full 5 stars.      I'll cut to the chase.  GO EAT HERE.      If you're like me and my fiancee; you are just looking for some restaurant, any restaurant, that actually has food worth paying for.  Also, you only want to spend $20 max per entree.  If this is you, go to SOHO.        Beverage selection-awesome. (one word, Cheerwine)  Hospitality-awesome.  Ambiance-awesome.  Price-awesome.      We had biscuits, an appetizer, an entree, a po' boy (with homemade chips) and a speciality soda.  Total check with tax was $42 bucks.        The shrimp and cheesy grits were delicious.  The low country boil was good too.  My po' boy was flavorful but my bread was a little soggy, had they toasted it, it would have been perfect. (-1/2 star) Their homemade hot sauce is killer.  I'm a hot sauce fanatic and theirs might be my new all time favorite.  The biscuits were exactly what you want from a biscuit if you've ever lived in the south, and they are served with jam and butter.  Just that little thing made my absolute day.        You'll be glad you went and so will whomever you bring with you.        SIDE GRIPE:      Whatever happened to Hostesses greeting you at the door?!  The 2 restaurants I went to before SOHO all had hostesses whom when I walked in the door just frickin' stared at me!  With this raised-eyebrow, smug look on their faces like, \"Yeah? Can I help you with something?\"  (Lolita & Momocho)  Piss off & shame on you.  You are the first face customers see when they walk in the door.  Greet them and make them feel welcome.  Chew gum and text on your break!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the delicious peach pur√©e Bellini and the amazing homemade biscuit with butter. The shrimp and grits was kind of disappointing. The grits were cheesy and tasty. The sausage was just ok. The corn was a little weird - and the shrimp weren't cooked enough. I like mine pan seared and these almost looked steamed and the flavor was lacking.  The deviled eggs are ok... Didn't have much of a kick.  Friendly staff and quick service. Very cute brunch place. My taste buds just weren't feeling the food I guess."}
{"text":"Dinner at SOHO was 4.5 stars for food, 3 stars for cocktails. The fresh biscuits with herbed butter and jam were delicious and disappeared in the blink of an eye. I had a taste of my companion's duck gumbo, which was pretty tasty. Both of us had steak for dinner, which had a fantastic char on the outside while still being done to perfection on the inside. The mashed sweet potatoes were amazing. Overall, the food was fantastic and I'm excited to go back again.   The drinks were OK, but I think their drinks menu needs some fine tuning still. The New Orleans was overwhelmed by absinthe and lacked subtlety. Neither of us wanted to finish it. Hopefully there will be evolution of their drinks menu in the future so they quality of their drinks matches the amazing food."}
{"text":"Soho Chicken + Whiskey was voted number 1 for their fried chicken. After going, I can certainly see why. I ordered the chicken and rosemary waffles, which were literally the best chicken and waffles I have ever had. The chicken was chicken and moist and the waffle was unique. If I lived in Cleveland, I could easily dine here on a weekly basis"}
{"text":"We didn't get a chance to eat here, but we came in for a drink and I love the decor.  The food looked yummy!!  West 25th is getting hotter every time we come home for a visit!!  I can't wait to see what else pops up in this area!!  The crowd at SOHO was great, and there was a fun vibe.  I'm definitely coming back during my next visit to try the food!!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out on Sunday for brunch. Right as they opened, it was already packed- the place isn't that big. Everyone was very nice and our waitress was wonderful. Food was excellent! We obviously got the chicken and waffles- which the two of us shared (big portion). Add a side of crispy breakfast potatoes- wow so yummy! Can't wait to come here again and try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Best drink amazing food great prices. The severs and nice and really know they menu. Got really great suggestions i give this place 5"}
{"text":"We recently went to SOHO and it was fantastic!  It is a great addition to Ohio City.  The pimento cheese appetizer was terrific and has a nice zing to it.  I highly recommend the fried chicken!  Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Chicken asparagus and mashed potatoes. Just OK.  Nothing to rave about honestly. The devil eggs were good tho! It's always some sort of pepper confetti when they present there apps, it doesn't do anything but piss me off! It's so amateur looking. No where I'd go again for dinner.  Drinks maybe dinner no..."}
