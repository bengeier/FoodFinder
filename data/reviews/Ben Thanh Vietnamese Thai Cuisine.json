{"text":"Other than the decor being modern, there is nothing I would recommend about this restaurant.  The service is slow, the food is not very good (but I wonder if that is what \"fusion\" is suppose to be like) and the prices relatively speaking is high for other comparative Viet/Thai places.  It's close and convenient which is the only reason we've been 3 times but another restaurant has opened up nearby now - thank goodness."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Ben Thanh restaurants... but not this one. Had the worst experience for lunch one time and vowed to never go back.   There were maybe a total of 3 tables of customers when we went, but the service was still EXTREMELY slow. Our waitress also tried to memorize our orders but got it all wrong! We then had to flag her down 3 times to remind her to get us some water. The only time she was quick was when she brought our bill.... before we asked for it (and before I even finished half my food)!  Needless to say there was no tip."}
{"text":"One star because the appetizers (spring rolls, thai and viet) were tasty and the food came out quickly. The other four stars are missing because:  Water didn't come to our table, it had to be requested both initially and to be refilled.  Only 2/8 of my rice paper were steamed and flexible enough for me to actually roll my pork and vermicelli into. This couldn't be rectified because we NEVER saw our waitress.   My friend's soup had a hair in it which was replaced, but not comped (outrageous!).   The only working bathroom stall out of three in the ladies' room had vomit on the toilet...  We were first seated near the door (on a winter's night) and i had to request we be moved to the warmer, second dining room.   Never again and can't in good conscience recommend."}
{"text":"I have to question if the chefs are actually trained to make asian food.  This is a fusion of Viet, Thai, and other asian food but it seems like they couldn't get any of them right.  I came here for lunch for the first time with two co-workers and I ordered the satay noodle because I haven't had it for awhile and thought I'd give it a try.  I was really not impressed when the food came because everything was just simply bland.  The satay soup was very diluted with overwhelmed amount of noodles to make up for the lack of flavour.  My friend ordered the shrimp pad thai and as soon as I saw it I knew it wasn't made the authentic way.  What really makes a good pad thai is the sauce and to make it right, it should have tamarind sauce, fish sauce and lime juice.  To be honest, I didn't taste any of the ingredients.  Basically looks just like red food colouring and slapping on the shrimp and peanut toppings.  Save yourself a trip from this big disappointment but if you must try then you can't go wrong with their spring rolls."}
{"text":"I like their Pho.  It is a fair portion. I used to eat the large size, but the small is enough as well."}
{"text":"Unlike traditional Vietnamese restaurant, this one is nicely decorated and has the outer and inner sections.  The inner section is dim lighted to provide a decent atmosphere with sofa chairs and step up floor for partitions.  The patronages are a mixture of Caucasian, Chinese and Canadian.  The servers are youthful and energetic.  This is truly an Asian fusion restaurant with Vietnamese Pho, spring rolls, vermicelli, Thai food, Chinese Dim Sum, Fried Rice and Noodles, Vegetarian, Seafood and Cakes.  The Crispy Vietnamese Spring Rolls and Fresh Spring Rolls both are good. The Pho soup is clear and tasty.  The noodles in a large bowl is equivalent to extra-large in other Pho restaurant.  The Lemongrass Mushroom fried rice is soft and smells really good. The Green Papaya Salad is refreshing.   The price is décor is modern, the servers are friendly, the food is good and the price is economical.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Brought family there. Food was great and the service. The only disappointment was the glass that separates the back area had hand prints all over the glass. Price was right!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this restaurant doesn't have many great reviews.   My family and I love coming here for Thai! It's one of my fave places to go to! We come quite often and it never disappoints so I figured it deserved a good review! The only thing that I don't like is how big their menu is....it's practically a novel! They have so many options to choose from! And even though I usually order the same thing, it can still take a while to decide. I usually order the chilli calamari, Tom yum and beef pad sew. Today we had pho (which was ok, I probably wouldn't get it again. I would recommend to go to an actual pho resto if that's what you really want), chili calamari, spicy Thai noodles which was very good and chicken skewers with a peanut sauce...yum!  Service has always been pretty good. Servers we've had in the past have been friendly, knew the menu very well, was cautious about food allergies and fast & efficient.   This review is based off items I usually order and it's always just as good as the first! I've also tried their Thai coconut sour soup with chicken which was ok, I've had better at other restaurants. Their specialty drinks always looked good when I see others order it but never tried, maybe next time!   Everyone will have their preferences but I would definitely recommend eating here once...or twice!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve a star, the worst service ever with sub par food.  They informed us upon entry of the 15% gratuity charge because of our group, then the servers were no where to be found.   Had to get up and find them to get us water, napkins etc.  When I expressed my concerns to the staff they just nodded and said yeah 13 times.   Will never go back or recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of an asian Moxie's/ Milestones/ Joey Tomato's ... its very trendy and the wait staff is young and attractive.  The decor is modern and stylish.  It is a very large open space with a nice bar.  Great for big groups, parties, and dates.    Unfortunately ... the food is not fantastic ...   The flavours are a little toned down and a little on the sweet side.  The style is some sort of thai/ viet/ chinese fusion.  The prices are more than reasonable - it isn't expensive at all.  I'd say the average cost is like $10/ dish.  Since we came as a big group, we ordered a bunch of appetizers ... I can't quite remember what we ordered but it wasn't that memorable - unfortunately.  But, it was passable and edible.    I tend to prefer my food to be on the saltier, spicier, and more intense ... the style here is a little more on the mild and sweet side.    There is ample parking and the place is quite easy to find.  For some reason, I hope this place succeeds.  There needs to be more \"pretty\" asian restaurants!"}
{"text":"I've ate in this branch a couple of times, not out of my own cravings but the insistence of my significant other who likes this place better than myself. This place is a fair place to eat, notably for the setting, cleanliness, service, food presentation, and to a degree the price. But for actual food taste, I would argue I have tasted a little better or better somewhere else.   Setting  This fairly new Ben Thanh Mississauga has an elegant touch setting, comfortable chairs (with the sofa seats) and roomy interior, and decorative walls. Soft lighting. It's mainly divided into two areas. One area is near the entrance has sofa like seats, and the bar. The second area just behind the bar has the normal table and chairs setting, and closer to the washroom. For comfort take the sofas seats near the entrance, but you may have to be more than two in your party to get those seats. For a little more privacy though, you may want to have the seating behind the bar.   Service  The attendants and servers are dressed pretty formal and are in general courteous, but you will find others are friendlier and more helpful. Wait time is not bad. You'll get your appetizers in about 5 minutes. The main entries follows a few minutes later.   Price  Pretty decent. You pay more for the setting, presentation, service rather than the food taste, explained below   Food  And the significant part of the review is the food.  The serving sizes are average. what makes it look big are the plates. Most entries have the food spaced evenly on the plates. I don't mind the big size, it's actually helping than small size plate, plus the plates are real decent ceramic, with no noticeable scratches, maybe because these plates are pretty new.  As for the taste, I'll say there is adequate spice in most food, but not much on the taste. But beware of the entries that have the red chili icon besides them, especially if you don't have high tolerance to spice, it means it's really spicy/hot to the taste buds. The good thing is that the servers do warn you that it's really hot. Also you can ask the servers to reduce the spice, or either mild , or none. But if you selected to have no spice, the food will taste really bland. The taste is not too savoury though. For example, I ordered the seafood Pad Thai, there's not enough of the flavour food stuff, like ground peanuts, egg, tofu, squid, shrimp. 90% of it was the noodle, maybe that's why it didn't taste as good. The food stuff should be about 30-40% and noodle is 70-60%. Also the shrimp rolls are good appetizers, provided that you dip them in the the peanut sauce. Without the sauce, it would taste bland.    In summary,  Other than the (sort of bland) food taste, I'll say this place is good for dining in for the elegant setting, courteous servers, short wait times, cleanliness. I sincerely hoped that they satisfied my taste buds as their ad promo insists on the Ben Thanh website, but unfortunately didn't.  I do plan to come here again, but when I do, I hope the food taste has improved."}
{"text":"Came here a few times expecting to see improvement, but its the same thing over and over again. Poor quality of food, soup was cold, grilled chicken was cold. Poor service. Was done my food by the time my Thai Tea came and it was watered down... Worst restaurant I've ever ate at. Somebody put this spot out of business. I will never take a chance on this place again."}
{"text":"I honestly wouldn't recommend going to this place. They clearly don't care about the food they put out.   I've been here a few times and it was always mediocre to decent food with waitresses getting annoyed if you don't tip well enough.  This time -  I got takeout pho. I was so horrified I threw out my food and called the restaurant to complain. Will I ever be back? Not at all which is why offering a store credit after traumatizing a customer is probably not the best option.  When I opened my container of noodles and meat to get it ready - what do I see when I move the meat around. The blood from the meat had soaked into the noodles right to the bottom of the container. However if it was fresh blood I would have said whatever - the hot broth will cook it. This however was brown old stagnant blood that had soaked into the noodles.  When I called and spoke to the supervisor he informed me that they always pre prepare these takeout containers of sliced raw meat and noodles. Apparently it's considered too much trouble to put fresh noodles in a container with 3 slices of meat and some garnish.   Essentially - lazy and unhygienic. Enough said to put me off. If they do this with the take out pho stuff - imagine other things.  I will add the broth was extremely salty and lacked beef or roast onion and spice flavours. All you tasted was salt.  I honestly would not recommend this restaurant no matter how desperate you are.  I also got the jackfruit milkshake - which was more ice than jackfruit. It's disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"I used to go to the ben thanh at the chase. Im not sure if they are affiliated with each other.    Despite the current 'meh' reviews. I liked this place very much.  The interior is very modern and nice.  Pretty big on the inside with a separate room.  My vegetarian mom has a strict food diet.  There are specific things that she cant eat due to her religion.  Our waiter terry knew exactly what kind of vegetarian she was.  I was very impressed.  His service was just amazing.  The food was great especially for the price. I got the pho ben thanh special and my wife got malaysian style noodle.     We also got 2 yummy drinks.  Check pictures.  Price 5/5 Venue 4.5/5 Service 5/5 Food 5/5"}
{"text":"Worst Pad Thai ever. I unfortunately didn't use my own advise which is to never order pad Thai from a Viet-Thai restaurant. I can make better pad Thai at home. Seriously, finished it because I was starving. It was runny, too sweet and the chicken was boiled and rubbery.  Also, waiters were either half asleep or rude.  Cashew chicken and sweet and sour chicken were okay. But overly saucy. Tasted like anything from a food court.  I only gave it 1 star because their grass jelly drinks and mango salad are good.  Won't be coming back for those though."}
{"text":"Woahhhhh what happened? This place used to be my favourite but now hubby and I will have to find another joint to hit up for our pho cravings. The broth is known to be a bit different than authentic pho but today was was dark brown with white residue on the sides and SO salty- my husband couldn't even stomach it! I ate my noodles because I was way too hungry but left the broth alone.   It must've been an off day in the kitchen/ they're getting sloppy because the deep fried shrimp rolls I got were over-cooked.   Thankfully, we at least got to enjoy the fresh shrimp rolls (big, juicy shrimp in a tightly rolled vermicelli wrap). And the water. The water was great! And that's about it ..  Usually there's a non-smiling thin lady who serves us but this time a new, smiling girl served us. She was very nice and when we told her the soup tastes off she said she would let the kitchen know. She handled everything really well (professional and courteous) but the only thing I wondered is why she didn't take off my husband's soup when she saw that he didn't eat any of his soup.   Sorry but not sorry, Ben Thanh... You've lost some loyal customers here because of the inconsistency and mediocre service. Let me know when you step it up because we had something good!"}
{"text":"Not the cleanest location. The bathroom is just caked on grossness that always looks the same.  The only reason I go back is the food (soups) are great.  LOL they seam to make their own versions of what's on the actual menu though....like the avocado beef rice rolls...every locations makes them with vermicelli noodles and the menu states that but here they always leave them out and will try and convince you the menu is not correct.  The other locations are way better"}
{"text":"Nicely decorated and clean. But food is not so great, it has gotten worse over the years to a point that I've stopped going.   Parking is limited near the front facing Dundas. If you come late you will have to go all the way to the back.   Service was still good til the day that I last visited fall of 2013.   I wouldn't really recommend."}
{"text":"Not sure why it has a low rating, but I really liked this place.  Interior is clean, and very modern.  Tons of seating, with very spacious booths.  Menu is very large, with many items to choose from.  From viet, to thai, to chinese food.  I really enjoyed their red curry, and malaysian style fried noodles (spicy!). Staff was very friendly and accommodating.  My mother-in-law is a strict vegetarian (no meat, onions, garlic), and the waiter was able to help find her customize something she could eat.  I really like their drink menu too.  Thai Iced Tea or Avocado Shake... Yum!"}
{"text":"It's been my experience that authentic Thai food is a beautifully balanced fusion of colours, textures and flavours.  This is due to its geographic proximity to the various countries in the near and far east and the spices and techniquest that they use to prepare their own foods.  I believe this is why there are so many \"Thai/Vietnamese\" fusion joints in the GTA.         Ben Thanh has a nice decor and plenty of parking off of a well-traveled portion of Dundas St West on the Mississauga/Oakville border.  It's a very large joint that offers spacious booths and relatively clean washrooms (not always the case with these types of restaurants sadly).       However, beneath this comfortable atmosphere and clean decor, lies some very bland food.  The Vietnamesse spring rolls were okay but certainly not the best that I've ever had.  The Pad Thai was a gooey, orange pile of the classic Thai dish that was garnished nicely with a sprig of cilantro and a small lime wedge.  However, it was missing that spicey,savoury, sweetness combination that I love so much with this dish.  The only plus was that they were generous with the seafood.  The price was reasonable and the portions were generous.  I just wish the quality was there."}
{"text":"Ordered: House Pho, large. Seafood laksa, large. Pineapple fried rice. Mung bean with pandan jelly.  Go for XL ($9.99).  Their bowls are smaller compared to other Pho restaurants.  Ambiance justifiés their prices.  Clean and has no fish sauce smell on their tables."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place but the quality of food has gotten so low. Their seafood pad Thai was my favourite but now it just swims in oil, there was no flavour and tofu was undercooked. On top of that, i found the service pretty rude!   Overall Disappointed! Won't be returning!!"}
{"text":"After trying tons of Thai restaurants in the US, I was excited to try this Thai restaurant in Canada.  Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as I expected.  First of all, this is the only Thai restaurant that doesn't serve Thai Iced Tea or Thai Iced Coffee.  I was shocked.  What kind of Thai restaurant doesn't serve Thai Iced Tea?  Now to the food: - Vegetable Spring Rolls: decent, nothing great - Thai Tom Yum Soup: Delicious!!! (their soup servings are huge.  The regular single serving is good enough for two people) - Thai Coconut Soup: Very good (not as good as the Tom Yum Soup) - Thai Yellow Curry: Delicious - Thai Red Curry: Ok - nothing great - Spicy Coconut Mixed Vegetables: Very very delicious.....this was my favorite curry. - Singapore Noodles: terrible....stay away from this.  This place does not serve rice with curries (another first for me).  So we ordered the Veggie Fried Rice.  Overall, the food was decent and service mediocre.  The ambiance of the restaurant is nice though.    I would rate this place average for food."}
{"text":"So I'm going to start by saying that I'm giving this location a 2 star, prior to my most recent experience it would have gotten a 3 star, but I was so unimpressed by the service my colleagues and I received, while trying to eat a quick lunch, that it put a sour taste in my mouth.   First I'll begin by saying that I ordered my Thai usual, the BBQ pork and shrimp skewer vermicelli bowl with a spring roll. Two of my colleagues ordered a similar dish, another ordered the classic Pad Thai, and another (vegetarian) ordered a vegetable stir fry with steamed rice.   The moment we sat down we mentioned to our waitress that we were in a bit of a rush (pretty typical for lunch hour) and she said that wouldn't be a problem. For this reason we got our orders in quickly. And then we sat and waited, and waited and waited. Then one dish came out for one of my colleagues. Being polite my colleague said she would wait for the rest of us to get our meal. We continued to wait. Her meal had been sitting in front of her now (getting cold) while the rested of us continued to wait. We overheard another couple sitting adjacent to us complaining that they had not gotten their meal. We were pretty convinced that the meal they were talking about was sitting in front of my colleague. There was NO way that they could have made her meal that much quicker than the rest of ours when she ordered a vermicelli bowl like just like myself and another colleague of mine. Our absent waitress was no where to be found in order to question her about our meals.   Finally 3 more dishes came out. We were pleased to have our food, but now my colleague whose food came out 15 minutes earlier, was not happy that her meal was cold. She complained to the waitress and the waitress said she could have the chef make another, but that didn't help our situation because we were there for a QUICK lunch and we needed to be back to work in 15 minutes. My one colleague who had ordered the beef vermicelli ended up getting pork, which she politely ate, but was not impressed by this screw up.   Have I mentioned we're still waiting on one meal? Yes, the last and final meal (the veggie stir fry dish - took the longest!!!) finally came out. We immediately asked for take-out containers and said we needed our bill because we had to leave. Our waitress was prompt to get our take-out containers, but NO bill. We had to go. We figured we would just go to the front counter and ask for our bill. So up we got and headed to the front. We got to the front and our waitress came running behind us. We asked if there was any way any of the meals could be comped because of the long wait and wrong orders. The waitress apologized profusely and said to us that one of the grills was down and there was nothing she could have done about it. (Why she wouldn't have told us that right from the beginning when we said we were in a bit of a rush made no sense to us, we would have left and eaten someone else and spared ourselves this awful experience.) After a long drawn out conversation (which we didn't have time for) she gave each of us 10% off our meals and did not comp any meal.   We were very unimpressed by this experience, which was really disappointing, because this restaurant had become our go-to lunch place because of its proximity to our work. I have continued to get take-out dishes from there, but as a result of the poor service we received in the restaurant I will not likely be dining in any time soon."}
{"text":"I was shocked this place is now closed! I've been here many times with friends and we've always enjoyed the food and drinks. My experience here was always great, from the waitstaff, food, presentation and decor. It's a shame this has happened and it will be difficult to find a place nearby here with the same quality."}
{"text":"We've been going to this location of Ben Thanh since they opened.   The food is pretty good. Fairly standard Vietnamese/Thai menu albeit a HUGE menu with countless options. They also offer some dim sum items which have to be ordered from a separate menu (rather than carts being wheeled around).  The service is usually fairly good and the waitstaff are friendly enough.   The restaurant is quite clean and the bathrooms are okay, but often look like they need a bit of tidying up. The restaurant interior is quite large and the decor is pretty contemporary.  We've tried many things from the menu and I'd say our favourites include the Vietnamese yellow lamb curry, several Thai curries, Malaysian style noodles and the ginger beef with vegetables.   The crispy Vietnamese spring rolls are very good as are the fresh rice rolls. The chili salt calamari is another favourite of ours.  The vermicelli bowls are good too, but as I've shown in my pics. the shrimp on a sugarcane was pretty much all sugarcane with only a thin layer of shrimp. This has happened twice here and once in another Ben Thanh location, so I guess it's not a fluke (no pun intended lol).  The dishes always come out very quickly after ordering and we've never been delivered anything that isn't piping hot (except cold dishes of course).   The food prices are quite reasonable. Drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic are also fairly reasonably priced.  One of the reasons we kept returning was their lobster special, which is unfortunately no longer offered. It was $20 for a whole lobster stir-fried with ginger and green onion and it was really, really good! We're very disappointed that this has been discontinued.   All in all, it's pretty good just not outstanding. Solid 3-star Viet-Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"My parents seem to love this place. But after meeting them there for lunch today, I can't understand why. The restaurant style is definitely unique. The front section is so wonderfully bright and spacious. We were led towards the back, which ended up looking like a disco cave. So very dark and mirrored. Though, I believe décor doesn't mean anything when it comes to food. Most of the time.  The waiter came and haphazardly set the table with plates that had a dirty film on them. Thankfully we did not need them for the soup we ordered. The large, book style menus needed updating as they had seen better days, perhaps 10 years ago.  The Pho I ordered was just fine. More expensive than most other places. The brisket was also fattier than I am used to. Originally I was looking to order the shrimp dumpling noodle soup, but they had run out of dumplings by noon on a Sunday. We all had to alter our orders because of this.   On a positive note, the fried dough sticks were nice and crispy. Despite the crispy sticks, we will not be back to Ben Thanh."}
{"text":"Food is okay, not that great though. Was kinda disappointed since I like the food at other Ben Thanh locations. Atmosphere is nice - nice decor and stuff."}
{"text":"Ugliest architecture that I have seen in my life for a restaurant.   Dark, cold, just like a dungeon. The main dining room has no windows, painted black and felt claustrophobic.  Ruined my appetite.   Try an authentic place rather than a fusion place like this which can't get anything right on."}
{"text":"Authentic food. Decent service. Great prices. We come here often. No refills on pop (all cans) and when it gets busy the service staff ignore and avoid the front. Will be back here but not when it's busy"}
{"text":"Good food. We took the soup noddles and it was fresh and tasty. Plates were empty ! The waiter was sympathic and fast.  I recommend."}
{"text":"R.I.P Ben Thanh.  I was looking at the website for L. A. Boil Seafood and noticed that they plan to open a new restaurant in this location. On the internet, I also saw an old business for sale listing for this address. L. A. Boil appears to be owned by the 168 Sushi Asian Buffet that is a bit east of this part of Dundas. I have eaten at the L. A. Boil Seafood restaurant in Waterloo and gave it three stars."}
{"text":"This review is based on my first visit there.  ATMOSPHERE: Nice décor, dim lighting, very spacious despite the dark interior that makes it seem small - the tables are spaced out well. There are 2 dining rooms. Good for smaller groups/parties. I was in a party of 5.  SERVICE: Good but slow. They seemed under-staffed as our server took care of many tables. They had lots of bus boy/girls bringing out the food. But the actual server was so busy, he didn't refill our drinks in time - we had to ask a few times before we finally got our refills.  PRICE: Very reasonable. Not expensive but not cheap either.  FOOD: They have a huge menu. So it's good for parties where tastes differs. We ordered 4 items for our party of 5...  1. Appetizer Platter (mini spring rolls, shrimp rolls, crispy wontons, mango salad, satay chicken skewers): was all right. Nothing spectacular, but hits the spot for fried appies.  2. 1.5lb Basil Lobster on crispy fried noodle, in ginger & green onion sauce: The lobster was pretty fresh! The meat was sweet and juicy.  3. Viet style Curry Lamb: Flavour of curry was fantastic - but the sauce itself was too watery. Would've liked it to be thicker. The lamb came in bite-sized chunks which was fine for eating with rice. I'm a big fan of lamb so I may be biased - but I didn't think it was gamey at all. Con to this dish: you have to order the rice separately.  4. Curry Crab with bread: This was the BEST dish of the evening. And whether it was planned that way - it was served to us last. It was finger-lickin' good. The curry was thick with some crab meat already mixed into it. The crab itself is served whole, with legs already separated. Tools are given to you to break them down into smaller pieces, as most places do.   They only give you one roll to share. So we (between all 5 of us) had to order 2 more rolls of bread to polish off the curry and crab."}
