{"text":"Leutner has some of the most overpriced low quality food on campus. The food is often undercooked, and varies highly in quality with who prepares it."}
{"text":"I honestly wonder if the workers purposefully assault our tastebuds with some of the worst flavor profiles known to man just for the heck of it, but atleast they sometimes they jazz a meal up with a little surprise of some strands of hair in the meals."}
{"text":"Agree with other review. Low quality dining hall food. Why does this need a review, generally, people should never go into a dining hall unless you are a student and have no choice."}
