{"text":"I work around this area and have come to the Blue Elephant for lunch on several occasions.  The staff is friendly and the decor is modern and clean.  It's a nice and quiet place to go have an affordable meal.    I have gotten their quesadilla, the small portion, which is plenty enough and it is delicious. I thought at first that having no meat would make the quesadilla not as tasty but it is packed with flavor! If your looking for a place with good coffee and healthy food, this is the place to come!"}
{"text":"The food was instance rice and microwave curry. Doesn't matter now.... They closed shop"}
{"text":"Good food,  but service is slow considering I just ordered a sandwich. They definitely need to add some cooks in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Just opened, good coffee and free wifi. Radio is a little loud and space is kind of sterile, but I'm sure it will get better with time."}
{"text":"The coffee here was delicious, full of robust flavors with very little acidity. Best coffee I've had in the area. The free wifi and clean interior were bonuses."}
{"text":"I'll start off with the food. Food is delicious, especially the Cranberry Panini. Cranberry sauce, jalapeños, arugula-spinach, onions, and Monterey Jack cheese. Yum! It's my my favorite dish there. Their other sandwiches and quesadillas are delicious.  I love the drinks they offer. There's horizon chocolate milk, coconut water, the usual sodas, propel, and many more. I've heard the coffee is absolutely amazing. I've never had it, but my friends love it.  The ambiance is nice. The inside is clean and simple, but it lacks decoration. There is free wifi and everyone there is really nice.   The only negative thing I can say about this place are the portion sizes. But since the food isn't expensive, the portion sizes makes sense."}
{"text":"I use to love going here for lunch.  Recently they changed their menu and it's now very limited.   They took away my favorite panini in fact they offer no panninis now.  The wraps are inconsistent in the way they are made.  The hummus wrap barely has any hummus now.  The sandwiches use to come with chips and a pickle and now they don't come with anything, now getting much less for my money.  I use to be a regular at this restaurant and there is no longer a reason for me to return.   I am hopeful that the management changes some things back to being more customer focused.  This is a great location and there is plenty of opportunity for a profitable business if they treat their customers better."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, it was a nice addition to RIDC Park - making fresh wraps, salads, and grilled cheese on their panini press. Now, their food menu has become much more limited. When I went in a month ago and again today their only food offerings were frozen Indian meals for lunch entrees and a few basic salads. While I admit the Channa Masala entree I had was tasty, the lady working told me that they buy it frozen from a bag, dump it out, and heat it up on top of rice for $8. I don't know what's happened, because this was a decent place to grab a sandwich and coffee a few years ago, and now their menu is 1/4 of the size and it's often deserted. I'm just not sure how they are able to keep their doors open, surely not with the sales of kitchy gifts. If you're looking for a lunchtime meal, skip Blue Elephant."}
{"text":"I was exploring Pittsburgh last week, when I came across this hidden gem. I easily found a place in their parking lot (since it's humongous). The Cafe had two blue elephants on either side of the main entrance, which reminded me of the beautiful blue pottery artwork kings and queens used to have in their palaces centuries ago in India.   This place is very simple and elegant, and it perfect for a casual Tuesday afternoon. Their menu is completely vegetarian, and most of their menu can cater to vegans too. I ordered the cranberry panini and 3-bean chilli. My order came within 5 minutes, and it was the most delicious cranberry panini I had ever had. I was excited to see the wide variety of teas they had, and tried the ginger tea and the green tea. Both were great.   If you are in Pittsburgh, you HAVE TO visit this Cafe."}
{"text":"I have to admit I only come here for coffee. Not that the lunch menu does not look good, but I usually brown bag it.  This place is located on Gamma Drive. The inside is extremely clean with ample space. There are lots of seats and tables. I believe they also have some conference rooms there as well as an outdoor patio.  The food menu is a vegetarian menu. I really enjoy the coffee as it is robust and flavorful.  all the non flavored coffees are organic."}
{"text":"After working in RIDC Park for almost 3 months, I finally decided to check out the Blue Elephant Cafe.  I was surprised to find out that they were actually a vegetarian, organic cafe! While I don't live by either of these culinary choices, I still found their menu to be enticing and ordered the White Cheddar Apple Medley Panini.  It was served hot within 5 minutes, and my bill came to a little over $8 for the sandwich (which came with a pickle and side of chips) and beverage.  Not bad!  The sandwich itself was delicious. A great blend of flavors, though I found it a little difficult to eat at times. When I bit into the sandwich the apple wanted to escape and either ended up slipping out of the sandwich or hanging from my teeth. Not being one to leave a fallen sandwich behind, I trudged on and made a happy plate (or joined the Clean Plate Club, depending on which reference you fancy).  I will definitely be back soon, seeing as its a short walk from my office and a healthy alternative to many other quick dining options in the area."}
{"text":"What a great little lunch spot hidden in RIDC  park. This is a vegetarian cafe that serves coffee beverages and a bunch of delicious lunch options like panini sandwiches, quesadillas, soup, salad, and pizza.   I ordered the white apple cheddar panini. It was melty white cheddar, apples, onion, and mustard on a grain bread. This baby was so good! I could have eaten 10 of them!...well maybe not, but I would love the stomach capacity to do so because this sandwich was bomb! It was served with a side of chips and a pickle spear. You could get a side of fries for an up-charge.   I was there at noon and it was pretty dead. I don't know if that's the usual scene or if the bad weather was keeping people away, but I hope this place gets solid business because I'd love to see it stick around."}
{"text":"So I totally didn't read the reviews and discovered that this place is vegetarian while I was looking at the menu thinking \"where's the meat\".    I didn't miss it though.  It is a 3.5 for me.  Here's why.    First impression...what a cute cafe!  It's clean and cool with some tables and a little seating area with leather chairs.  There's also a small private room with a conference table in it.   Bathroom is clean and modern.    Then onto the ordering - it's fast casual style.   I was sort of reminded of a trip to the doctor's office because it was a really clinical experience.   The lady at the counter was really slow and rather uninspired by her work.  Turns out we'd interrupted her lunch, which she went out to the dining area to eat after she waited on us.  My lunch was served to-go.  Not sure why since she didn't ask.   The food was mixed.  The jalapeño popper panini I had was pretty good.  Creamy and cheesy, with a punch from some sliced jalapeños.   It was pretty large too.  The hash brown tater tots were straight from the Ore Ida bag.  Not bad, but pretty generic.   The sandwich, tots, bottle of water, and random bag of chips I didn't order came to just over $10.    A solid lunch cafe if you work in the area, but the menu is a tad limited and the service could use some work."}
{"text":"got two large black coffees to go and they were extremely weak, and were also smalls instead of larges. definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are amazing! All vegetarian. I highly recommend this place. The only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the slow service."}
{"text":"I just had a wonderful panini sandwich with a group of friends at Blue Elephant Cafe. It was filled with apple slivers, delicious cheese, fresh greens, and a spicy mustard. The wonderful lunch was topped off with an extraordinarily good cup of coffee. Try out this pretty spot whenever you're in the neighborhood. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Good coffee and a nice selection of vegetarian lunch options. This place is across the street from my building and I frequent it often. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that I think the prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian food from cultures around the world, right here in Pittsburgh. Definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"Delicious Coffee. Friendly Staff. Grateful for the Coconut Water & pH balanced Bottled Water. Knocking off one star for the snack selection, though it's improving!"}
