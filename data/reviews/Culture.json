{"text":"The food was good, but over priced considering the portion size and poor service.  It's a Sunday afternoon, most places downtown are closed.  I was the only patron in the place and the lost my order?  I would not make it a point to go back.  My options were limited today however."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner and Jazz!! The staff were very welcoming and attentive. Food was very good I had chicken Parmesan and my sister in law had Shrimp Carbonara.  Definitely a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"I tried this makeover and found it very pleasant. One night- I believe a Wednesday- they had a nice jazz ensemble. The wine that I had both times - a white Pinot- was very good. I ate at the bar and liked the food. The service was friendly which is always my number one need in any restaurant and/or bar."}
{"text":"This used to be the Grille on Seventh. We'll start with The menu. The menu is limited, but looks good. A little more expensive than it should be ($17 hamburger, $18 salmon salad). But, they have great outdoor seating in the Katz park across the street from the Benedum. Our time was limited and we let our waiter know, so we ordered what appeared to be easy, ravioli, two salads and an iced tea. We were one of, perhaps 3 tables.  This is where the story changes. We can't review the food as we didn't get it. Our time ran out. As with most patrons in the Cultural Distrct, we had show tickets. We went inside for the third time asking about our food. Again they said it was coming. I presume they were waiting for the tea to steep as well. We explained we had to leave. A nice woman came out and took my name. She apologized and said she would take care of us upon our return. We don't know when or if that will happen. Not feeling much confidence. They weren't busy then, not sure what another visit will reveal."}
{"text":"Impressive new restaurant in the hear of the Cultural District, replacing the Grille on Seventh.  They have added live Jazz music on Wednesday nights, which I love.  This is a great place to come before a theatrical show, dance or performance.  There's a bar on the second floor, which is a fun option.  The chef is Claude Pierre. The menu is fairly eclectic."}
{"text":"We first found Culture in February. Wife and i were downtown for a show, and had some time before it started, so we decided to stop and get a drink. We tried to go to Proper brick oven, but the place was an overcrowded madhouse so we left. We saw Culture across the street and it didn't look too crowded so we went there. We sat at the bar and had a drink. The atmosphere was easy going and the staff very friendly. We decided to come back for dinner some night.
   Fast forward to April, we are in town for another show and decided to go to Culture. We got there later than we wanted due to silly traffic issues from the damn Pirates game. 
   We were seated immediately and served promptly. Our server was very busy, as the patio was open outside and she was covering it also. We both ordered a salad, mine with chicken and my wife with salmon. The portion of salmon on her salad was very generous, and was done perfectly. She raved! My chicken was also done perfectly, and was very tasty, My wife had a cosmo, and it was very good. 
   The people at Culture are a big part of what makes the difference IMO. We were able to make our show on time, and after the show i suggested we stop back at Culture for a cocktail while the traffic cleared. We were in the plaza close to their patio when the gentleman from Culture who we had talked to at dinner saw us. He came over to us, invited us to sit at a table and relax, and offered to bring us drinks himself. I am not sure if he was a manager, owner part owner or what, bit he was an awesome guy and made us feel both welcome and important. 
   We enjoyed a drink, and ordered a chicken quesadilla, which we shared, and it was fantastic. The staff was super friendly, and the whole atmosphere was friendly and upbeat. 
   Culture has only been open a short time. They are still fine tuning their business. The prices are competitive for the cultural district. Their drinks are actually a little less expensive than Olive or Twist. I think they may have been a little short staffed, but the staff that was there was exemplary.
  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been craving Chicken Parmesan for a while and they delivered. Very hospitable service and I actually got to meet the Chef Claude Pierre. We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant in the heart of the cultural district. The Chef makes some great wings! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"When you enter you're greeted by a long narrow restaurant with space immediately to your left for a band to perform. The bar is directly in front of you and the hostess table said \"Please wait to be seated\". One of the people behind the bar politely yelled over to wait a moment. 

We were lead to the back of the restaurant and given a choice of two tables. I choose the bigger one, as I'm not a fan of constantly rearranging my plates, drinks, and condiments to make table space.

We were given a one page one sided menu with Comfort and Cuisine sections, along with salads and sandwiches. The comfort section included items such as a burger and wings. The cuisine section included things like Salmon, Chicken, and Steak dishes. The sandwiches included a pulled pork and two other dishes. 

The waiter also mentioned two special dishes: blackened tilapia and seafood ravioli. 

They had no drink menu, just a verbal menu that repeated drink and no doubt skipped a few. They seemed to have a short wine and beer list.

We ordered the Blackened Tilapia Special and Chicken and Shrimp Pasta with a Cajun sauce. The portions were spot on. The tilapia was simply seasoned lightly and came on a bed of rice and vegetables. It was good but nothing special. The Cajun pasta was presented well and the large shrimp were visible (tails on). Under the shrimp and pasta were large prices of rather dry chicken. The sauce could have been heavier and a bit more Cajun. I've paid less for a more satisfying dish.

Oh and I ordered a beer (or two) and the waiter twice carried the beer at the top where I put my lips. I don't think I've ever noticed someone do this before and maybe I'm just being weird... But it  seemed abnormal to me.

All in all, I would definitely come back to this restaurant, but I'd just come for drinks and some live music."}
{"text":"We came here before seeing a show at the Benedum Center. There were 7 of us. When we first arrived, 2 of us ordered Miller Lite. The waitress came back with one bottle of Miller Lite, stating it was their last bottle. 

When it came time to order, we discovered that we had three different menus with different prices on each. When we asked about it, the waitress informed us that we would be charged the least amount for anything that had a different price on different menus.

All of us ordered an entree and either a soup or salad to go with it. After a very long time, the waitress brought our entrees, but no soup or salads. We told her that we hadn't received our soup and salads. She replied that she would bring them right away. 

When we all had finished our meals, she arrived with a tray full of \"spring vegetable\" soups. This is not what any of us had ordered. They had run out of spring mix for the salads, so she couldn't bring those, and they had also run out of the turkey chili that the rest of us had ordered. The soup had chicken in it, and the two that had ordered the salads were vegetarians, so they could not eat it as a replacement. We were not even asked if we wanted a replacement, just given this soup instead (which the one of us who accepted it as a replacement ate with a fork)

The food was mediocre at best and the service was just terrible.
We have season tickets to the Benedum Center and I can assure you we will be finding a different restaurant to have dinner before our next show."}
{"text":"Came here this past Saturday for dinner at around 5pm. It wasn't crowded and my party of 4 were seated immediately. We came because it's a black owned business, & we wanted to check it out. The menu wasn't extensive, but it had lots of good sounding things. They don't have a physical drink menu, but of course made everything we asked for & all of us loved of our drinks. I had a guava mojito & it was amazing! I ordered the Jack Daniels wings which came with fries & it was delicious. It comes with 6 wings (flats and legs) - I could only eat 4. I think the fries were hand cut, they were great too. The owner came to talk to us, which showed great hospitality. There was a great live DJ and they have a chalk board of all the events going on. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because our food took a little longer than we anticipated (we were the only ones not seated at the bar) and we wished there a little more on the menu to pick from. However, the owner told us they just opened in January, so we figured they're still getting their footing in the industry. But, I will definitely be back!"}
