{"text":"My wife, son,  and I stopped by on Saturday night...didn't even know this place existed until we drove by after our vacation.  We thought this place was great...it had a nice clean decor...the food was more than decent (with pages and pages of choices)...the prices were good...and the service was very attentive.  I really couldn't find anything wrong with the place...I'm taking into account that they are new and probably have to work out a few bugs...but hey...how often do we get a \"family\" operated business out here...I'm so tired of the corporate food choices.  We will continue to support this restaurant as they are one of the best in Surprise."}
{"text":"Boo, two thumbs down!   We had high hopes after seeing the article in the Surprise paper but we were SO disappointed.

The food was blah, it was loud w/kitchen noise, very faint music playing in the background, the decor is lame and honestly we have nothing good to say.  Well, I take that back... on the way out we noticed Archie's Deli and that saved the night.

There have been (3) restaurants in this same location that have failed and I'm pretty sure it will be (4) soon."}
{"text":"We went to have breakfast and have mixed feelings. 

Wife and I both ordered the pancake combo. Pancakes were decent in my opinion, However my wife loved them. Wife ordered scrambled eggs with cheese which was forgotten, I had mine over easy and found out that I have been ordering them wrong all these years. What I really wanted was over medium. Now I know.

We ordered toast and bacon for our daughter. Got two tasteless pieces of deep fried bacon and rye toast. RYE! Who serves a kid rye toast? They replaced it with bad white, and we found out after the fact that according to the receipt it was 3 pieces of bacon not 2 for 2.99.

The executive chef came out to inquire about our meal and was very interested which is a lot more than most do when they come by to ask about the meal. He did appologize and gave us a coupon and we will go back to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Just as an FYI--the dude who gave this place 5 stars works there. I saw him when we were there working behind the counter. I hate when people write up fake reviews about their own places of business. So not cool."}
