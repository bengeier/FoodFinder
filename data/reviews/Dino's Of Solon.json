{"text":"We had never eaten at Dino's but decided to try them based on a promotion they ran. We ordered the family pack carry out. Family packs come with salad, pasta, bread, and the main dish. Excellent, excellent, excellent food, and generous amounts. So glad we decided to try Dino's; they have earned our future business. My only suggestion is to call ahead for carry out as my wait was not exactly short!"}
{"text":"Best Chicken Picata ever.  Very clean and new.  Patio Bar nice in the summer.  Pasta sauce is 3rd generation - out of this world.  Kind and attentive service."}
{"text":"Okay it looked like an old world Italian joint ... And tasted like it.  Not terrible but very average.  Ate there last Thursday, my first time.  Very friendly service, suggested signature dish -  Chicken Piccata.  Too heavily breaded and soaked in wine sauce.  Actually flavor profile was very good, but lighten up on the preparation ... Please.   Cavatelli was way too dense, but meat sauce was very flavorful.  My biggest issue ... Good Italian restaurants should have great bread ... Not here.  So if I was looking for Italian in Solon ... Jimmy Dadonnas is way better.  Hey Murray we were right not to try this last month ... Good call."}
{"text":"Growing up our family would dine at Dino's at the St. Clair location - what memories!  My favorite dish was the cavatelli (we called them Cavadils).  Most Italian places don't serve it anymore, so it was quite a treat to be able to order them again after all these years.  The sauce didn't spark any memories, although it was faintly familiar.  We went as a large group and were seated immediately (we had reserved a table).  Service was excellent.  The atmosphere is relaxed - they don't seem to be rushing people in and out.  The salad is available with shredded mozzarella cheese - and boy is it piled on.  I had elected mine without - and I'm kind of glad I did.  Bread was Ok - nothing special.    The prices were about what you'd expect for a slightly upscale place in the heart of Solon.    Overall I would go again when up to visit family."}
