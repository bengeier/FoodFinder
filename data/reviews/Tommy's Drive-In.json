{"text":"My order is never right and I'm always charged for bacon and never receive the bacon (3rd time ) and I paid for a order of orings (4$) and only revive 5 very small onion rings wouldn't of even called it a side . They been more down heel lately"}
{"text":"Made a return trip after not coming here for a couple months. Wife got cheeseburger, but would not order onions as they cost extra. Drinks have shrunk and the utensils are still plastic. No problem with that because we didn't get any. The waitress never came back after taking our order, so we couldn't ask for any. Someone else brought our food. Wife asked for lemon in water. The result was no lemon, no waitress. Every time we seen her she was running by our table looking the other way. Will not return. Fries not really hot, but no waitress to complain to."}
{"text":"Just waited 25 minutes for an ok burger and chewy fries.  No apology, no explanation. No reason to do that again."}
{"text":"Good old place food is good price is fare speedy service everyone happy and fat a must try a few unusual  sandwiches  on the menu I had the double cheese burger with grilled cheese yummy"}
{"text":"Food and service are always great.  Everything is always fresh and waiters always keep check with you to make sure you don't need anything."}
{"text":"I will never go back. The food was old and cold. The bathroom was so nasty, I refused to use it. I was sick after eating there, I threw up all night. If I could give this this restaurant a 0, I would!!!! Horrible place."}
{"text":"Returned there again to give it another shot.   Inattentive wait staff and very slow service sort of highlighted this visit.  The food was okay but to watch ticked off people sitting around waiting for their food and drinks didn't create much of an atmosphere.  Lunch crowd was very light and still the service was pretty slow."}
{"text":"This has been a local restaurant I have went to for years. A few years back it really went down hill, but new owners brought change. I'm being honest when I say the burgers they are serving now are some of the best I have ever had.  I get mine  with chili mustRd onion and slaw. Yes it is messy but that is ok, my meat is juicy and tasty, well seasoned. and served on a good but. Plus, they don't under or over do the added stuff. The burgers are worth going. I! love the corn nuggets to. The chicken sandwich is yummy too. They also serve fried chicken plate hamburger steak and more. French fries can be normal or fresh cut, I like fresh cut.  Tommy still has curb service,  plus  indoor sitting.  In doors is a bit run down but the food makes up for it"}
{"text":"We stop by here every once in awhile. The service is decent but normally a longer than usual wait time for whatever reason. I really like the chef salads they have. The portion is more than enough for just one person. As for the other items they offer I'm not sure. I personally haven't eaten anything else."}
{"text":"I've been by that place a million times and never stopped.  So about a month ago my fiance and I went there.  All I can say is that place is nasty. Never never again. I just don't see how a place like that stays open. Completely disgusting."}
{"text":"A very nice salad enjoyed vey much but the person with had to ask for bread to be grilled and more sauce as it was very little."}
{"text":"Great service but not as good as other burgers. Thin and possibly frozen. Two poor girl baskets and drinks 25.00. Not making a special trip here."}
{"text":"Friendly family type of place. Stopped in for a burger and fries. The burger was just ok, I don't like their ketchup. Weird flavor The fries and onion rings came hot, but way too greasy for me Wish I could support them but it's not for me"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot to go eat, its quick and friendly, great food good environment, you can walk in and sit down or sit in your car and they bring the service to you!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! You get a lot of food for your money. The waitress and waiters are very nice. The only complaint I have is the ketchup, personally I like Heinz or Hunts ketchup but the ketchup they use is an off brand. I have had a hotdog a burger and their fried pickles which all seemed to be great. I will return in the future!"}
{"text":"It gets very busy at lunchtime, with the restaurant filled with police, firefighters, and EMS technicians.  Very friendly waitresses and curbside service."}
