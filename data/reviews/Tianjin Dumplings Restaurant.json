{"text":"My gf and I decided to give this place a try since its been around for a while, so it must be decent. We went around odd hours, so we were the only ones there. The Owner/Server only spoke Mandarin, but luckily the menu has some English to check off the stuff you want.

We got their 'Steam Soup Dumpling w/Shrimp'. ($6) Thinking this would taste like 'xiao long bao', it most certainly DID not. I thought it was okay, but not that good.

Got their 'steam dumpling'-12 pcs ($5). It tasted okay. I could of bought this at the Chinese grocery store and enjoyed it at home.

Leek & Egg (2pcs cut in 4) $4. This was pan fried for a bit, and it was crispy. But it tasted alright.

Tea Egg (.80c)- Just ordinary. -_-

Individual Buns (.90c per bun). Got two pork/leek and one shrimp/pork. Again, its only okay.

I do notice, I heard the microwave go on/off a lot, which means most of the dish is just being warmed up to serve. The only thing boiled is the dumplings, and the leek egg pancake being pan fried.

Overall, this is DEF one-time deal, and would not go back. Good luck to the Owner and their family business as we do not dig this style of food they've served.

+ for a/c on a hot summer day!"}
{"text":"2nd visit was today, everything excellent. Go for the tasty food not the washroom. Pay cash. Delicious."}
{"text":"Yes it's a hole in the wall.  Yes they don't turn on their heat (keep your coat on in winter).  BUT the buns are tasty, the dough is fluffy, and there's plenty of new flavours for those who haven't had northern style Chinese food."}
{"text":"Cheap but good! The owners only speak Mandarin but I'm glad they served the ones I wanted. Wanton soup and pork in pancake are my fav."}
{"text":"Who knew a hole in the wall would have such tasty food!

VENUE
I think I just walked into Tian Jin! I was with a friend and we were looking for a place to eat. My friend is from Tian Jin so of course we had to stop and try this place when we saw it.  The place looked very bare and had all your plastic utensils stacked nicely at each table.  There was a huge menu on the wall and they had the English translations (score!).

FOOD
We had dumplings, wonton soup, pancakes and peanuts/seaweed/potatoes.  It came out to $15, which was pretty cheap.  The wonton soup was delicious. It had such a specific taste and was filled with wontons.  My friend said the pancakes tasted exactly how they do in China so that's always good.  The steamed buns were fairly big and they didn't skimp on meat or seafood.

They didn't give us any tea until we asked.  I'm pretty sure they gave us their personal tea pot and gave us a couple of bowls to drink from which gave us a chuckle.  They didn't give us any napkins.

I wanted some vinegar and ginger but they had no place to pour it so I could dip my buns. 

WAIT STAFF
No English what so ever. 

TRAFFIC
It was dead when we went in. One woman did come to order takeout so this is probably a takeout business.  It makes sense place doesn't have the pristine clean feel.

All in all, great small business with excellent prices. I'd suggest to get takeout."}
{"text":"Now I know where I can go for breakfast!! A real authentic Northern Chinese breakfast... 

Tianjin Dumplings Restaurant opens at 8 AM... though there are no business hours posted. 

There are a special list for breakfast: Fried Egg Pancake and Douch, Baked Pancake and Beef,, Tea Egg, Red Bean Congee, Rice Bean Congee etc..... oh of course soy Milk!!

Tianjin Dumplings Restaurant is really specialized in BUNS... 13 different kind of buns... 

Steamed Seafood and Meat Mini Buns ($4.99) comes in a count of 6. Nice and juicy and full of soup... I ate the 6 buns with vinegar that help lessened the oiliness... The skin was really thin.. so it is kind of a cross between dumplings and buns!

The big buns are $0.99 each and good if you want to try different fillings... 

They always has 3 kinds of dumplings which I would have to come back and try later!!

Great place to practise Mandarin!! Both ladies that work there hardly understand or speak English!! How authentic can it get as a Chinese experience??

I love the homey feel of Tianjin!! How the staffs chatting with me like I am one of the family and another customer helping me with my Mandarin pronunciation!!"}
{"text":"I was really really really craving some good juicy buns the day I had Tianjin Dumplings, but man... I was not a fan of this place at all. 

I had an order of pork buns as well as their Tofu salty pudding.

The pork buns were soooooo stale. The skin was so chewy, and was not soft at all. It was almost as if I had buns from the night before (since I went early in the morning). The filling was also kind of small. The meat, although decently flavourful, was pretty tight. I just felt like the texture of the entire bun was completely off.

The tofu salty pudding (Do Fu Nao) on the other hand was pretty decent. It had some Chinese pickled vegetables, cilantro, and some sauces/chili spices that made it very rich. 

I was really looking forward to some really good buns that day though :'( Would not come back."}
{"text":"This place is tiny as hell, so order take out if you can. The food is very cheap and very good for what you pay. I suggest getting the meat buns. They are super juicy (I mean it, be careful of spilling juice all over yourself) and have an ample portion of meat. 

The employees don't really speak English, so think about that before coming."}
{"text":"The food is good. The service is horrible. U get seated early but they forget u or run out or w.e but they didn't serve my table but serve the other 4 that sit-down after me. I'm didn't get my food for like 25mins the other tables that sat after me already got all their food and almost done eating before they came over to tell me the sold out on something I ordered.

They run out of everything... Why wait so long to tell me to reorder. So pissed off. Didn't even gi ve me water.

Finally got some food. ... Buns were cold... Like not even warm... And the water had lemon shredded in it.... And a layer of oil... So disappointed... And they aren't even busy...

So they sold out of noodle....my ass... The table that sat down after mine got noodles... Why?!? Cuz the dumb ppl that work here never put in my order until 20mins later and came to tell me they sold out of basically everything I ordered cuz they gave it to the other ppl that sat down after me. I am so disappointed and grossed out by this place! Do not come here. They really do not deserve business ... They make decent food... It's not good enough for u to suffer this amount of bad service.!!! U have to ask for cutlery and they give u take out ones!!! The waitress is not nice. Acted like a bitch saying we didn't put ur order in when I complained we didn't get any food for 25mins!!! Do I need to wait an hour for ur holyness ???? Honestly I'm not at a five star French restaurant. This is like a zero star Hong Kong side street stall... But even their service and food taste better.... 


I would give them -100 if I could they definitely do not deserve any stars"}
