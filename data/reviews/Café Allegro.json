{"text":"I really want to love this place more because they source so many local ingredients including grass fed beef for hamburgers. The staff is mostly wonderful, especially the sous chef turned executive chef. He's so sweet. 

The reason I hesitate to give this place more stars is because I recently learned they make their salad dressing from a mixture of olive oil and canola oil. Sorry, but canola oil is not OK or healthful. I was told a long time ago that they used olive oil only so either that wasn't true or they've changed the recipe. Sadly. The other reason I can't go higher than 3 stars is that darn near every time I'm there for the burger, the thing isn't cooked right. The people working the grill need some lessons. When I order medium rare, it comes out rare. When I order it medium, it comes out tough and well done. 

I think the prices are decent and the decor nice. I really enjoy the place but have gone there so much less over the months due to the above complaints. I wasn't going to write a review because I just don't like leaving reviews unless they're great, but I'm hoping that someone there is reading these and taking the reviews into consideration. There are so few places with grass fed meat options which endears me to MIM but if it can't be cooked properly, I lose the desire to go."}
{"text":"I see a lot of other reviewers calling this place a cafeteria, but it's not a cafeteria in the way you would think.. The setup of the line and seating is in a cafeteria style but that's the closest to cafeteria it is. The food can be considered pricey, but the hotdogs and hamburger meat are from local farms with grass fed beef. They make all the sauces, soups, salsas, and salad dressings from scratch. Most of their ingredients are organic, from local farmers or both. All of their packaged items are made from scratch in house daily. They get their flour from Hayden Mill in Tempe and they have a list of their other providers for the vegetables and meat so their food really Is Fresh! The local, global, and grill items are pretty large portions as we had to share ours and take the rest home. I noticed others splitting their dishes too. They have vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options. They customize any dish to your needs. They are only open during lunch time because they also do catering and banquets for the museum. Someone compared the packaged ready to go salads and sandwiches to Safeway but I don't think Safeway gets their ingredients from local farmers. Their ingredients probably travel hundreds if not thousands of miles and surely aren't as fresh. The sandwiches are dry but they have condiments although I would rather have one of the salads than a sandwich. The menu is always changing depending on what they have in season but I really enjoyed the global and local most of the times I visited."}
{"text":"Hands down the best kept secret in Phoenix for farm to table cuisine.  I call it an accessible Chez Panisse.  It is the only farm to table restaurant I would feel comfortable bringing my toddler to.  Newly appointed exec chef Chris Lenza is dedicated to sourcing from local farmers, ranchers, and artisans.  Menu changes frequently based on availability of items.  Innovative cafe approach allows you to see the line chefs in action.  Restaurant manager is also very accommodating to families, assisting you with your order, seating, etc.  They also cater to special diets: vegan, veg, paleo, gluten-free, you name it.  My faves: shrimp ceviche, braised short ribs on polenta, sweet potato chips, cardoon gratin toast, turnip puree, and of course, their decadent chocolate brownie.  Also, amazing local wine selection.  By far, one of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"I ordered the hot dog and clam chowder.

The hotdog with side of fruit was $13... It was good, but overpriced. The clam chowder was priced reasonably at 6 or 7 buck. It was good and filled with plenty of clam.

I wouldn't go here unless you're really hungry and don't feel like driving to desert ridge. No real quality complaints, it's just too expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Right at the heart of the MIM (Musical Instrument Museum Museum), delicious pastries, coffee and such."}
{"text":"For a public attraction place the restaurant is definitely above average. It tries hard to carry a French influence but it overdoes it. It is cafeteria style after all with a buffet so why having linens on tables? The food was good but again how good can cafeteria food be? What I disliked entirely were the round tables which are not practical for the type public this place caters to. There are lots -- a lot -- of seniors on wheel chairs, moms with strollers, etc, trying to navigate between round tables. Very impractical and fussy."}
{"text":"The food alone deserves 5 stars; add an always welcoming staff, fresh ingredients, and an ever changing menu that compliments the regional museum exhibitions - where is the 6 star button? 

We eat here at least 3x a week, you cannot beat this restaurant for price, quality and service in Scottsdale. This is a well run kitchen serving great food at an affordable price - in fact after eating here and tasting the freshness for yourself, you'll start to feel conned by so many other restaurants that charge more and for little nutritional value in their dishes. This restaurant is an example to all restaurants."}
{"text":"Something in-between a 3 and a 4 but since it's a 3/4 served in a museum and not in a fancier place, I won't be as harsh. Was here with 2 others, obviously after walking in the museum for a good while.

Two of us, myself included, had the global lunch special which was Indian lentil cakes. One person had a salad from the cafe area next door which was fine and inexpensive. I also got a German chocolate chip/coconut cookie and someone had a cup of sweet potato/coconut soup. There was a mix of drinks.

They have a nice selection of sodas including a very good brand of cream soda/root beer as well as a pretty varied beer selection (bierre de guarde in a museum, you don't say.) The coffee from the next door area was pretty good as well and the woman there was nice.

Salad was fine, I won't review as well it's a normal salad.

I tried some of the sweet potato soup. It was frankly delicious with a good amount of spice and coconut. I can see why it's offered pretty often. Around a 4.1 or so.

In terms of our main dishes, they were served rather elegantly, especially for a cafe found in a museum.

Lentil cakes were served with raita, tomatoes, creamed corn (what,)  a lil' glass of masala chai tea, and some mint/cucumber sorbet. It was 13 dollars, like all of the global specials.

Lentil cakes: A bit hard but otherwise nicely spiced. There were 2 large ones. I wouldn't exactly call them Indian style lentil cakes (they were more like lentil fritters) but they were fine. 3.2

The cucumber raita was a bit watery but otherwise, it had a nice cooling effect for the spices in the lentil. 2.9

The tomatoes were fresh and quite delicious. I remember one of the lentils having 2 tomatoes while the other had 1 which was a bit odd in terms of consumption as they went quite well together.

The creamed corn was good and it somewhat went with the rest of the food. 3.3.

The masala chai was good, a bit watery, but the spices were there. It went well with the rest of the dishes.

The sorbet was very refreshing and quite solid. 3.7.

The chocolate chip cookie was pretty solid. Pretty soft and a whole lot of coconut/walnut. Not bad.

The food overall was not bad. It's something between a 3 and a 4."}
{"text":"I went to the MIM with my wife and daughters at the July. We enjoyed our tour of the museum, and really thought it was amazing and unique. 

I have to make a comment about the food that is served at the MIM. We ordered 4 Thai style chicken salads at Cafe Allegro. The salad was mixed fresh in front of us, but was served on triangular starter - size plates and we were charged $52 for the 4 plates, including tax. 

The chef's are courteous and the salad was served fresh and reasonably tasty, but the portion was minuscule and, for that reason, very poor value for money - it left all four of us hungry and dissatisfied. I needed to go back and order a cup of small cup of soup and was charged a further $10. 

Perhaps a \"museum premium\" needs to be placed on the food served in, what is essentially a glorified self service canteen with little warmth or atmosphere, but in order to justify that, patrons should be treated to a far larger portions for the prices that MIM is levying."}
{"text":"Interestingly simple menu yet elegant. Very fresh and healthy selections with a gourmet twist. Loved the service and the presentation. Had one of the daily express sandwiches. Local Herb-Garlic Roasted Turkey Breast, Provolone Cheese, Organic Lettuces, Local AZ Cucumbers, Maya's Farm Toscana Kale, on MJ Multi Grain Bread. It came with a nice serving of house pickled peppers and veggies. Great view outside the window. Don't forget a homemade cookie or one of their other tasty treats for desert."}
{"text":"Work day lunch. They usually have 1 AZ dish n 1 international (in addition to the regular sandwiches etc) I have always enjoyed a meal there. I have always found the food fresh and really tasty."}
{"text":"Color me impressed!  Really much more interesting than I'd have expected.  FYI coffee shop has Cafe MIM sandwiches and baked goods until 9pm thurs/fri, 5pm other days"}
{"text":"Cafe Allegro is the restaurant inside the Musical Instrument Museum (MIM)

It's cafeteria style, but the food is much more upscale than your traditional cafeteria.

I ordered the trip tip - it came with au jus and horseradish sauce, and was served to order (I like mine rare and it was).  I found it a little on the sweet side (I prefer tri tip more savory), but it was still good.  The roasted yukon gold potatoes were very nice, and everything was seasoned with a sprinkle of black Hawaiian salt.

My wife got the peach pancakes, and they were very nice (I only got a small bite ;-)).

Good selection of bottled sodas (our son, who also got the tri tip, got a prickly pear soda - fairly tart but pretty nice).  They had a pink lemonade called Leninade - the bottle had a soviet sort of theme - I guess that's for people who want 'pinko lemonade'?  ;-)

Our daughter ordered the mac-n-cheese, and it was good - came with a fruit bowl, also.

Not cheap, but pretty darned good, as museum food goes!"}
{"text":"The place stands on its own. Get some lunch even if you aren't planning to commit to the museum.  A healthy, fresh lunch in a great location."}
{"text":"Located at the Musical Instrument Museum
Great food & beverage selection
The staff is super friendly
The food is healthy, locally-produced, and delicious
Loved the watermelon gazpacho
Chicken burger was very tasty; sweet potato friends
Serve beer
The prices are a little high, especially for the beverages"}
{"text":"I know...this place gets great reviews.  I think I even saw the word gourmet.  

Not in my book.  We've eaten here twice, both times in the cafeteria section in the back.  The part that some reviewers love.  Food was just OK.  Well, no, as a matter of fact - out of the eight meals I'm rating, two were almost unacceptable.  And the service was......what service?  Forgotten order - once.  Delivered to wrong table - twice.

4-5 stars for the museum.  You bet!
2-3 stars for the gourmet restaurant."}
{"text":"Ever since MIM opened in 2010, I come to their cafeteria for lunch a few times a year. I am always pleased with lunch I get from here.  Limited menu. Local, Global or some sandwiches.  I always get \"local\". Menu changes not sure how often and I won't know what is served until I get there.

Local menu is made from ingredients they source within 150 miles of MIM. All fresh and some organic. I like the food when I can actually taste the ingredients.

Today's local dish was chicken salad.  Chicken was so juicy and tender, chicken and blue cheese was a perfect combination, Brussels Sprouts was cooked to perfection, salad was fresh, beets tasted like beets should taste.  I also had a side of tomato soup today.  Again, I really like the food when I can actually taste the ingredients and the soup was no exception.  While the salad looks small on the picture, they are actually large.  Some beans on the salad, I became full before I finished a half of the salad.

It's cafeteria style but serves very fresh food.  Cost more than average cafeteria.  You have to carry your own tray to the table.  Staff here is always friendly and efficient.  Did I mention I really like the food when I can actually taste the ingredients?"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch with my mom after visiting the Museum.  I was curious to try this place since it received a good review from Howard Seftel in the AZ Republic.

It's basically cafeteria style and you can order several interesting choices.  I noticed that a lot of their produce is organic and grown locally.

I had the Global which if memory serves me correctly, was a braised beef shank.  It was served with a salad of super fresh ingredients including purple beets.

Definitely try to stop in for lunch.  They are only open 11AM to 2 PM."}
{"text":"Brought my 10-year old son to the MIM for the first time today and was looking forward to lunch. Ugh! Was I in for a surprise. I purchased the turkey sandwich for myself, which came on bread that fell apart as soon as I took it out of the plastic container. And the turkey was grey. Yes, grey. I have never seen grey turkey meat before so maybe they should use it as an exhibit. I also ordered a hot dog for my son, which was equally as bad. It was served with a side of beets that soaked the side of the bun. I mean, c'mon....beets with a hot dog!?! And the hot dog was salty and tasted like it had been in the refrigerator for waaaay too long. We also purchased a chocolate truffle brownie that looked good in the package but was just as horrible. The only upside was the French fries that came with the hot dog, which my son and I shared, and I sure they came straight from the freezer. This is truly a disappointment. When I pay this much for food ($30+), I expect it to be good. This was the most expensive plate of French fries I have ever purchased in my life! We won't be coming back here, and unless you are willing to shell out major bucks for a big fat steaming plate of crud, I suggest that you don't, either. One star is too generous for this place."}
{"text":"The museum itself is amazing. Highly recommended!  However we did not have the best experience in the cafe.  This was our first trip to the MIM as we just moved to the area. We sat down at a table and decided that we were not too hungry but wanted to see what they had. My girlfriend went up to the food area and asked the gentleman behind the counter if she could just have a bowl of soup or if she had to order it from one of the waitstaff that was walking around. The guy told her that she just needed to take \"this little number over to the table and we will bring it out\". Again, keep in mind we have never been here before. My girlfriend followed the instructions and took the number over to our table and we sat and waited. After about 15 minutes of waiting the manager walked over and spoke to us as if we were attempting to steal the soup. In a snide voice she says \"I think someone needs to make little trip up to the cash register\". I almost fell out of chair. I tried explaining that we were obviously confused about the process and I would walk up to the register and pay. The manager stood by our table and continued on with her rude and accusatory tone while I paid. She literally stood at our table and watched me walk over to the register and pay. IT WAS COMICAL. I thought I was on Candid Camera! Anyway, the manager finally authorized the delivery of our soup (which wasn't that good), we ate, and we left.  

The manager needs to work on her tact. First, the manager should not be coming over to my table unless I asked for her or if she is checking to make sure the food is cooked to our liking. Second, she should not have assumed the worse case scenario of \"soup thievery\", as I like to call it.  Third, after the situation was corrected she should offered her apologies rather than just walking away with a disgusted look on her face. 

In closing...we will be attending the MIM again. We will not be attending the Cafe at MIM again."}
{"text":"After spending two hours looking at (and listening to) some wonderful instruments, Violeta and I decided to meet up at the cafe.

The place was hoppin'!  It was 1pm, and there were actually two sections in this room.  While they had the same furniture, one area felt like a coffee shop, with the rounded counter adorned with cookies and deli cases filled with bottles of water and juices, and I don't know what else, since we decided to sit in the other section, which had a more \"open\" feel to it.  Large glass windows that allowed nature to envelope you, at least a little bit, and, I would have to say, it felt like a bustling bistro.  A bustling tree-hugging green bistro (and I type this in a loving, respectful way).  Wished there was more than just one busser, though.  If there were more, it certainly looked like there was only the one.  Waited for awhile for tables to be cleared.  Finally, I had to walk up to him to ask if he'd clean up ours.  If I hadn't felt rushed to sit and relax while waiting for the food to arrive before leaving for school, I wouldn't have minded the wait so much.  

I liked the organic, high-end feel to the place, and the busyness of the line cooks, who looked more like they should be cooking at a fancy steakhouse, and the presentations of the menus and food make you feel like you're really paying for quality here.  The menus allude to the usage of local produce and the occasional organic item, but I'd like to see higher-quality oils being used-- say no to GM soybean, canola, cottonseed, and corn oils!  I enjoyed my 6 oz. grass-fed burger and perfectly-crisped and seasoned sweet potato fries.  Next time, I'm going to have to check out the desserts.  Some looked absolutely devilish!

p.s.  Didn't like having to retrieve my own cutlery or napkins.  The atmosphere calls for cutlery enfolded in cloth, and on the table, not sitting in metal holders, like you're at a buffet or at the cafeteria at work.  The paper napkins were of high-quality super-absorbent material, though, I must say."}
{"text":"After spending a lovely day looking at musical instruments, or enjoying one of the concerts the MIM has, what better way to finish off your experience than to get lunch at this delectable cafe?  The food here has an emphasis on sustainable and locally produced food.  They have a lot of unique dishes here, and the menu changes daily.  Some examples include ahi tuna and caviar pizza, braised beef with potatoes, and unusual (and tasty) dessert such as chilled rhubarb soup with cake squares.  The portions are very filling, and service is excellent for a cafeteria style establishment.  Some of the dishes can be hit and miss, but I give them points for trying at least.  For instance, the tuna on the pizza I tried was a little overcooked and a little fishy tasting for me, and a chicken sandwich I had was bordering on the dry side.  The beef I have had here though has been very tender and flavorful so far though.  The cafeteria itself is in an open, airy, sunny locale, which provides a good view of the outdoors while you eat your meal."}
{"text":".  My group had lunch at the Cafe at MIM for the first time and I have to comment on the beef with radicchio and potatoes.  The beef was chewy,tough and with sinewy marbling. The server brought my piece from the back kitchen dunked it once in the juice and then placed it over the vegetables.  The chicken entree in cream sauce with mushrooms was tender and wonderful, as was the \"poppy\" wine selection and cookies. If you plan to eat at the Cafe be cautious when ordering beef selections.  I wrote to the MIM on my experience but have not heard from them.

{"text":"\"Went to the French Bastile Day celebration on Sunday. The restaurant is not able to serve for special events. Stood with a lunch tray and No tables! The quiche was HORRIBLE. A frozen quiche would have tasted better. Service was incompetent, many mistakes. Does the cook (surely not a Chef) actually knows French people?\"  Spent $$$ in rubber food! Besides being awful, it was a misrepresentation of French food and dining."}
{"text":"We had a very decent burger special. The curried vegetable soup was flavorful and the fresh fruit tasty. The setting is pleasant if you eat outside on the very spacious patio. The staff are friendly and helpful. Of course the big attraction for most patrons is the Musical Instrument Museum, which is special. The negatives are price, which we found high, $35 for two people, and the smell in the indoor space. At any rate, I'd come back if we were going to something at the museum."}
{"text":"I mean, it's cafeteria food at a museum. I ordered a hot dog. Maybe that was my mistake? It was fine. My friends' salads looked better. There's an outdoor terrace for dining, and that part was very very nice, indeed."}
{"text":"Definitely not 5 star food, but great service the day we were there. A bit pricy for what it is and for the environment.  This is NOT the Phoenix Art museum cafe.  This is a cafeteria style cafe, and it feels awkward because they keep telling you 'Walk down the line to see what there is\".. well, that's not really practical, is it?
  There were plenty of staff, SUPER friendly and welcoming.  Limited choices.  Hardly anything for vegans- not much for vegetarians.   Salads are premade in plastic containers at the beginning of the line. I can get that at Safeway.   No other salad offerings except a side salad or side fruit salad.  
   We had a longer than would be expected wait for our meals, so the manager (I think it was, but he had no nametag) brought us a complimentary desert without prompting and was very aware it was late, which we appreciated.  Wine was $11.00/glass.  Good selection... but 11.00 a glass and not a very generous pouring.  If we went to the MIM again, I am not sure we'd eat here.  Likely eat somewhere before.  We had two thin pizzas (nothing fancy- personal size- my cheese one was very greasy and the middle of the crust was soggy) and two glasses of wine and it was over 40.00.  The sandwiches others were having looked ordinary.  There are a few more choices when you get there beyond what is on the menu online- burgers, grilled chicken sandwich.  The deserts were terrific.  Overall, they are doing the best they can with the kinda, sorta upscale cafeteria setting."}
{"text":"I've eaten here couple of times and every time I think to myself I need to come here more often. Unfortunately museum is not the first place you think of when deciding where to eat. But I'm so glad we stopped by here today. Their fresh ingredients and many organic options are what I love about this place. I had a delicious organic salad today along with vegetarian soup. Their ham and cheese panini was delicious as well. It's awesome they change up their menu all the time. It's always a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Well I would have ten starred the museum - it is a knockout! - An Out of the park home run! Then when you think your brain is full, you say lets go to the restaurant for lunch. You walk in and it is very clean, modern and looking good, but the chow line looks like a cafeteria, then you shop a bit and find it is an extremely high quality, top shelf, incredible chef, locally grown, fantastic restaurant! When the first thing we ran into was venison carpaccio and it gets better from there! The soup was incredible, just incredible. This place goes hand in glove with the museum. To attempt to describe anything would make you slobber on your keyboard, and want to go even more! As the dishes are made with what is local, fresh and seasonal, just know it will be a wonderful dining experience, even if you have to carry a tray to your table!"}
