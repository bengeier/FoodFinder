{"text":"The price was a bit high, but the egg waffles tasted great!! it was like no other egg waffle I ever had before. And the cashier was really nice! He was really invested in their products! It tasted really good! I recommend the matcha or the cheese. It was cash only"}
{"text":"5/5 for having such unique, potent flavours! I've tried the durian and the cheese explosion flavours and the cheese one was really good!! Every little bubble had a burst of cream cheese and cheddar goodness! I'm not a big fan of durian in general so I can't speak much on that BUT I will most definitely be back to try their other flavours. I'm thinking matcha or strawberry yogurt for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Durian bubble waffles!!! A must for all durian lovers!!

I could smell the making of the bubble waffles from many stores away. The waffles are made upon ordering so they are nice and hot. I tried the durian bubble waffles ($6 including tax) and each of the bubbles are filled with creamy, durian filling. The price premium is definitely worth it!

Eat it quick! The waffle got soggy very quickly. The waffle was placed into the paper bag right after it was made. The white paper bag only had one small hole on the bottom."}
{"text":"So far one of the best I have tasted, the inside was soft and outside was crunchy.  Strongly recommended over any other egg  waffle place."}
{"text":"Best egg waffle in the GTA! The waffles are crispy on the outside and very flavorful custard on the inside.
We tried the Cheese Explosion and Durian flavors which were both amazing and highly recommended.
Cash only."}
{"text":"This is located right at the entrance of FMP (next to the pork jerky). 

An Eggette costs $5 approximately after tax or $7 with a drink (standard drinks such lemon tea, milk tea, lemon coke). 

I got the matcha Eggette since anything matcha sounds good to me, but I had low expectations since I figured they just mixed in some matcha powder with the batter. But I was wrong! The matcha was really good, instead they have a matcha paste, or filling, inside the eggettes. 

It's not like the super traditional HK ones where it's often crispy on the outside but more chewy on the inside; instead most of it is fairly soft and plushy. But that was fine, because I like it this way as well."}
{"text":"I have tried 3 of their HK Egg Waffles so far and they are pretty delicious. My personal favourites (which are also the costly ones) are the cheese version and durian version.  I really like the strong egg flavour and the textures (crispy outside with a more soft, chewy texture inside). 

Best to eat it hot since I took it outside into the Toronto cold ... it wasn't so good afterwards. Don't forget to get a stamp card! Buy six and get one free! 

History lesson - This owner is the direct descendant of the owner of a  Hong Kong 'Gai Daan Jai - Eggette' icon!"}
{"text":"I've always been a bit egg waffle-obsessed, and when I heard about Eggette Hut, I knew I had to come and try.

The menu is a small variety of different flavoured egg waffles ranging from original to durian.  I tried both the original and matcha.  I may be old fashioned, but I don't quite like any fancy flavours.  To its credit, the waffles were legit crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Definitely worth a try, but not with its hefty price tag - a regular waffle was $3.97 and a flavoured one up to $5.49!  This is compared to a typical standard of $3 for one, $5 for two at Pacific Mall.

On top of this, the waiting time was very long.  I came on a weekend and traffic was understandably high, but I ended up waiting a total of 20 mins for two waffles?  I'm not able to peek in the back of the store, but even with the curtains you can see the sectioned off areas as quite huge.  I sincerely hope they are able to add more waffle machines to facilitate the process."}
{"text":"Heard about this egg waffle shop for a while and saw people writing reviews about their egg waffles. After a few weeks, today, I finally had a chance to try it. I could see a lot of people in front of the store from far away. The store offered unique flavours, like durian, matcha etc. which I don't normally see. Nevertheless, I ordered a Matcha flavour and my husband ordered the cheese flavour. 

We got our egg waffles after a few minutes wait. The egg waffle with cheese was on the salty side though it was slightly sweet. It's quite filling. The egg waffle itself is crispy at the edge but soft in the middle bubble. On the other hand, the matcha flavour does have a rich flavour of matcha. To me, it seems like matcha paste was stuffed inside the egg waffles. It's a bit sweet to my personal taste. I couldn't deny that it's delicious. It would be perfect if the sweetness could be slightly adjusted, less sweet. 

It's about $4 or $5 for an order of egg waffles. The price depends on the type of flavours you would want to order. No matter which flavour one prefers, I did feel that it's a bit over pricing. 

Well!! It doesn't hurt to enjoy one once in a while! Next time, I may want to try the original order or the one with seaweed with pork floss."}
{"text":"HK style egg waffle | Milk tea | FMP 

Great snack place right at an entrance at First Markham Place (FMP). 

They have sweet and salty flavours to choose from. 

Add $2 to make it a combo with a drink. 

Came in and was welcomed nicely by the cashier who speaks English and Chinese. He explained with menu of the flavours and combo option. He suggested that the most popular flavour was the durian and the cheese. He mentioned that they use real ingredients inside and not just flavoured.

I ordered the durian egglet. It's crispy and has a bit of durian in each ball. I wouldn't say it's heavily flavoured. I also made it a combo with a hot HK style milk tea which was also pretty smooth and good.

Overall I suggest this place for a nice take-away snack from FMP."}
{"text":"I LOVE egg waffles, so of course as soon as I heard about this place I had to go immediately!! I was super excited to try the cheese explosion egg waffle. It sounds delicious!!!

I was a little disappointed. The cheese was not as strong as I had hoped- they should use more cheddar for a sharper cheese taste. The cheese on the inside is soft and not strong enough in flavor. It felt a little lacking.

I also tried the matcha flavor and it is really good but you have to be a big fan of matcha because it is STRONG. Seems like the most popular flavor is the durian as most people around me were buying that one. Will try next time.

Prices are a little steep for egg waffles, their profit margin must be huge. You can also add a drink for only $2 with a purchase of a waffle."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of egg waffles as well as strawberries. Egg waffles with strawberry yogurt flavour?! How can I miss out on this combo right?!!!

This cute little spot offers total of 9 flavours. There are actually a few flavours that i wanted to try:
- strawberry yogurt
- durian
- coconut

I tried the strawberry yogurt this time and it was sooo goood!!! The strawberry yogurt is evenly distributed to each waffle, and you can actually taste the fresh strawberry bits in them too. The waffles are crunchy on the outside, it's filled and not airy. 
They make each batch fresh so expect a little wait. 
The strawberry yogurt waffle is $5 including tax. 
Service is really good- they took time to explain the menu and gave me advice on which one to try.(because i had trouble deciding lol)

Remember to get a points card too for buy 6 get 1 free. 

I know I will be making my way back to try other flavours soon."}
{"text":"Location/Service
Right inside First Markham Place. It's not by the food court, but near the Three Owl Optical corner section. Plenty of parking available, Butler any Chinese mall - it gets pretty packed. 
Big sign at the top so it's easy to spot. They have no seating, a buy and go kinda thing. And can't really see inside, so can't comment on decor. 
Service is nice - the owner explains different kinds of egg waffles, which one is popular and makes recommendation. 

Food
They only serve HK egg waffles, so an easy to read menu item to choose from. Their original regular waffle is around $4 while other flavored ones are $6 like Cheese and Durian flavor. 

Original - crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Since there's no filling, so it's very airy on the inside. After a little while, it's a little bland. 

Cheese/Durian - same consistency as original (crunchy and soft), but each bubble is stuffed and packed with flavor. Cheese used was I believe cheddar cheese and evenly distributed throughout. It's melted too so you get that oozy feeling to it. As for Durian, it seems like they used the actual fruit (not flavoring or artificial). The smell and taste is strong and surprisingly complimented well! Again with that oozy feeling, that keeps me hooked and wanting more. 

Overall very nice place. The flavored ones are a bit filling, so definitely shareable as a snack. I would definitely come back and try their other flavors to see if I get that hook oozy feeling to it."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5/5.0

This place opened up about a month or so ago and has gained quite the hype with numerous specialty filled egg waffles on the menu.

Apparently the owner has been making these egg waffles in HK for well over a few decades.

I have tried coconut, durian, cheese, and pork floss. If you are a big durian fan then definitely give that one a try as the flavours are quite strong.

The waffle itself tastes very eggy and it is quite cakey/dense inside. In terms of the outer texture, at times it was lightly crisp but majority of time it was a bit softer than I want.

All in all, it is a good option to check out if you are in the area and want to get your egg waffle fix.

It will come down to personal preference as I tend to like egg waffles that are lighter inside without too much filling as the gooeyness makes it difficult for the outside layer to crisp up."}
{"text":"Cheese Explosion was very unique, it was cheesy but also a little sweet with something like a cream cheese filling. My hands got a bit greasy eating this one. Service was excellent, they were willing to make us just a chocolate waffle and hold the orange flavor. 

The waffles were nice and crispy on the outside while still soft in the middle. Toppings were evenly distributed. The waffles took about 4 minutes to be made, we were the only ones there on a week night close to closing. Staff were very welcoming. I would definitely return if I'm in the area as they have more unique flavors relative to other bubble waffle places. 

Nearest entrance: Mall Entrance D"}
{"text":"My sis and I ordered Matcha, Banana and Durian eggettes. 

The owner will ask if you'll be eating immediately or take it to go because they have 2 separate packagings. The difference is the clearance of the paper bag to easily access the eggettes. 

Once I ate the eggette, I knew immediately the fillings were top notch because there was so much flavour & each puff was balanced well with the fillings.

The Matcha eggette was filled with Premium powder. It was obvious because it was not sweetened but with a hint of bitterness.

The Durian eggette was filled with real fruit. It felt like I was eating the fruit itself. My sis wasn't fond of it because of the smell... that's how fresh it was.

The Banana eggette was filled with real fruit. Like banana bread, the aroma filled up my car on the way home."}

- Cheese egg waffle
- Original 

The in betweens:
- Seaweed & Pork Floss 
- Banana 
- Strawberry Yogurt

Not as impressed:
- Matcha 

I'm a huge fan of egg waffles and with so many flavours offered at Eggette Hut, we made an effort to go back several weekends to try them out. The original egg waffle here is definitely one of the most authentic and tasty I've had in Toronto. 

Original ($4 tax incl) - This one is a bit on the expensive side, as they are usually sold at $3 per waffle and easily cheaper if you buy 2. However, I think it's still worth it as the egg waffles here remind me of those in Hong Kong. There was a nice crunch on the outside and a soft slightly gooey texture inside. But the home run was definitely that lovely distinctive custard flavour. It was just a perfect bite.

Cheese ($6 tax incl) - This one, along with the original, are my favourite. I love the sharp cheesy flavour (likely cheddar), with a slight sweetness, which resembled cream cheese. The first half of the waffle was really delicious, but it does get soggy pretty quickly, so savour it as fast as possible!!

Seaweed & Pork Floss ($6 tax incl) - We had high expectations for this one, as we absolutely love the combination of pork floss and seaweed. However, the egg waffle turned out to be dryer than I expected, which I assume is caused by the dry pork floss. Not sure if it was a one off, but since I tried most of the flavours now, I may re-order this one.

Banana ($5 tax incl) - If you like banana bread, you'll probably like this. You actually get bits of slightly ripe bananas within each bubble, which I found pretty impressive as the outer shell of the egg waffle was still slightly crunchy.  

Strawberry Yogurt ($5 tax incl) - This one was surprisingly tasty, as I expected it to be on the sweet side, but the flavours were actually pretty balanced. However, this one does get soggy very quicky compared to the other fillings.

Matcha ($5 tax incl) - Although we can tell the matcha powder used is pretty good quality, this was our least favourite out of the ones we have tried. The matcha powder likely came sweetened, so when added to the egg waffle batter, it just became too sweet for our tastes.

Overall, I am very excited for this new addition! I knocked 0.5 stars off as it is on the pricier side, and the matcha one isn't something we would order again. The good news is, the higher price point is slightly offset by their loyalty card, which offers a free egg waffle after you purchase 6. Regardless of the higher price point though, we feel their quality is definitely worth the money, and there is no doubt we will be returning!"}
{"text":"[Access]
This shop is located at the far corner of First Markham Place (close to the restaurants outside). Lines are typically longer on weekends (no duh!) but lots of room for waiting lols. Service is pretty good, there are pictures on the menu if you have trouble deciding which flavour to order.
 
[Food]
I heard the drinks suck, maybe someone can try and report back lols. I've tried a couple of new egg waffle places and I do think this is the better one. They definitely make their waffles fresh so it's not like the Pacific Mall ones where they have a few lined up (I hate that). First pro to this egg waffle is that they are super crispy. The waffles are a little more airey, so it's not as soft as the ones from Hong Kong but the smell is very fragrant. I ordered the one with seaweed & pork floss, the flavour was not lost and it stayed strong throughout! I recommend this flavour. I tried something similar at the Kennedy & Highway 7 plaza - this one is better. My only complaint is that the waffles are a bit pricey, so I wouldn't make my way to FMP just for the egg waffle. But yes, I would buy another one if I was nearby =)"}
{"text":"Came here and got the seaweed & pork floss and durian egg waffle. The seaweed & pork floss was a very good combination and was a fresh twist to the classic egg waffle!! Durian egg waffle was good and didn't have too strong of a durian flavour, so just depends on personal preferences. The people there are very friendly and can speak English, Cantonese and Mandarin and I liked how they punched holes into the paper bags so that the egg waffles don't get soggy!"}
{"text":"Wow, the durian one is AMAZING!! At first I was reluctant because $6 is pretty expensive but it was SO worth it. 

I've seen a lot of egg waffle stores popping up recently but with confidence, I have to say this place does it best. Unlike the status quo (which is to mix the flavour into the waffle batter which dilutes the flavour), the way they make them here results in a delicious gooey burst of concentrated flavour that's contained within a crunchy original shell. Also, this is the first place that's offered durian flavour so bonus points to them!

I can't wait to come back and try the other flavours."}
{"text":"Been here twice and tried the original and durian egg waffle! Love this place because the waffles are crunchy and airy. The way the paper bag is designed also helps to prevent it from getting soggy. The durian egg waffle was delicious, fresh and full of flavour! They also have this promo card where if you buy 6, you get the 7th one free!"}
{"text":"Mmmm yummmy. Came for an afternoon snack after work at around 545! No wait (: very friendly staff ane they recommended the durian if you like that fruit or cheese! I opted for the cheese & got a cold honey lemon for extra 2 dollars! Freshly made to order. Crispy sides & yummy cheese which seems to be maybe cream cheese filling? Its not the stringy cheese i was expecting. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"As the others said, durian is the best! I love ??? and used to have durian flavor ??? back in my hometown GuangZhou. However, the Eggette here taste even better than the ones I had before. The price is reasonable because they have real fruit inside, a big chunks of fruit! The cheese and seaweed ones taste great too. ????????nice."}
{"text":"Amazing! The egg waffles were hot and fresh, and they were surprisingly crispy! We tried the banana flavour, and it was divine. Kind of like a banana pancake, but imagine that perfect egg waffle crisp to it. Since they're made on the spot, you'll need to wait 10minutes or so for them, but it's worth the wait. They also have a combo to get a drink for $2 more. The man working there was also quite friendly and you can tell he was passionate about the food. Definitely a nice treat if you're in fmp!"}
{"text":"My friends and I visited right after a disappointing ayce experience nearby. We really wanted something sweet to save our taste buds, and Eggette Hut did well to deliver.  

Eggette Hut's puff waffles have a crispier and thinner consistency compared to the softer cake-like waffles you usually get at Pacific Mall. Having grown up eating the waffles from Pacific Mall, Eggette Hut's crispy and thin waffles were a bit of a let down texture-wise. However, this may not be the case for some because my friends who grew up in HK prefer Eggette Hut's texture over the fluffier kinda at Pacific Mall. To each their own, so choose wisely. 

TL;DR conclusions...

Pros:
- various fillings are available
- durian is available as a filling!!
- waffles are made fresh upon your order 
- the bags are hole punched to ensure the waffles don't become moist from condensation
- free parking
- clerks can speak English and are very friendly 
- their waffles are thin and crispy (if you like that texture) 
- cheap pricing (approx 4-5 dollars per waffle) 
- the waffles aren't too sweet, so they provide a good base for whatever filling you choose

Cons:
- their waffles are thin and crispy (if you like a softer, cake-like texture like me) 

Would I return? Yes, I would because you don't see durian filled waffles everyday. They don't have a strong durian flavour to them, so non-durian fans may be able to stomach you eating the waffles around them."}
{"text":"Love this as a treat! Original is my favourite. Tried the strawberry and durian...not really my thing cuz it makes the waffle soft.  Ill just stick work my original flavor"}
{"text":"Pretty average, in comparison to many egg waffle places. 

Pros

flavours many places don't offer
pretty basic 
crispy


I ordered the coconut one, although I prefer the coconut to be like a melted texture in the egg waffles instead of shredded coconut pieces in the middle."}
{"text":"Came here to try an egg waffle today. This place is pretty pricy but they don't have much competition, in this plaza. My daughter chose the orange chocolate waffle. The man told us to return later because his staff were on their break. So we had to wait nearly 20 minutes, in total, to receive our order. It was $5 for our waffle, after tax. We thought that orange Chocolate was made using orange flavoured chocolate chips but that wasn't the case. It was regular chocolate chips with fresh orange zest. But instead of just the zest there was the pith too, making it bitter. I wouldn't recommend this flavour. While we were waiting, there were lots of potential customers but everyone was put off by the high prices. They all left. I highly doubt that I will ever return here as there are better and cheaper options nearer my house. Also, the flavours here do not appeal to us, we don't eat cheese or durian."}
{"text":"Very good! I got the seaweed and pork floss one and was delighted that they were so generous with the toppings. The seaweed and pork floss flavor was strong! The bubble waffle was also a bit different than other ones I've had - it's crispy and soft on the inside. There was a line when I got here so we had to wait for a while, but they were still quite efficient and the guy working was nice. I would come back to try the other flavours."}
{"text":"I've been craving HK Egg Waffles all day at work. So when I stopped by FMP for my eye appointment I knew I had to check this place out. The place is located at the end where no one goes to. The end closest to the restaurants. The shop is brightly light with yellow signage and yellow chicks. Super cute. 

It's basically HK Egg waffle with filling inside of them. They also have drinks which you can add to your waffle for $2 including tax. The guy who runs it is super friendly and fluent in English which is very rare. He explained everything to me and was very easy to talk to. I went with the matcha eggette based on the reviews. It did not disappoint!

You must eat these right away while they are still hot for the best flavor and taste. Each bubble was filled with the utmost matcha filling and it was hot and gooey. One waffle is definitely filling for me. It was only about 3 minute at most which isn't bad at all. Considering I remember woofles and cream had like a 45 minute wait there...

Only thing is that the price here is steep. After tax my waffle was $5, even for the original it was like $3.5+tax.
Would I get another one? Ye.

They also have a stamp card. Buy 6 get one free."}
{"text":"Tried the original and matcha bubble waffles. I will say they are better than other shops such as Chachago and the two places on the third floor of the Unionville T&T building. They are more crispy. They are not too sweet, which I like. However, the wait time was too long. Was told ten minutes when purchased but waited for half an hour. They know how much time is needed to make one and how many orders are on the list. They should give a more accurate time estimate. So just be aware."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to check this place out. And... I was pleasantly surprised. Came here after dinner at a nearby restaurant and we decided to pop by this place. After going through the menu, I chose the orange and chocolate flavoured egg waffles. The owner then explained a bit about the flavour I chose. Not bad, he actually did some research or has knowledge. I like that. After I placed the order the owner said, wait about 4 minutes. I gave him about 10 minutes after a stroll around FMP. When I picked up the egg waffle, it was still warm. So I started devouring it. Not bad, I tasted both the orange and chocolate flavours. But I would like if they used chocolate that isn't as sweet. That's my only \"critique\". Aside from that, not bad. Overall experience is quite good."}
{"text":"This a really tasty treat that I had never heard of before landing in Toronto. I had the cheese explosion and it is very good."}
{"text":"Taste: I tried the CHEESE EGG WAFFLE and it had a good balance of salty yet sweet.  The cheese inside almost had a custard like consistency which melted in your mouth, while the crunchy exterior of the egg waffle encased this melty goodness perfectly.

Location:  In a little stall near the entrance to FMP.  Perfect for on the go snacking.  There are no places to sit here.

Price:  A little pricey, sitting at over $5 per waffle

Comparable:  Toast Delight has more variety with competitive prices.  Cha Cha Go is not as well done.  Wooffles and Cream was the original one in Markham, but quite expensive as well."}
{"text":"omg the Durian waffles was loaded with soft melt in your mouth durian inside each piece! delicious! not a big fan or the plan of the matcha. i didn't love the green tea so strong and so much filling, i guess it's good if you love green tea a lot. the plain one has a crispy outer and inside was not fluffy enough. there is a bit of a wait, but it comes out nice and hot."}
{"text":"$6 for durian eggette seems a bit too steep for my pockets but a very nice treat! It's crispy and you can see durian flesh when you pull out the bubbles one by one"}
{"text":"This is my favourite egg waffle place in Toronto, they actually put flavour in EACH bite. I've tried both the pork floss & seaweed and banana, enjoyed both."}
{"text":"Got the seaweed flavour, while less crispy than id like, the variety of flavours will get me returning to try more."}
{"text":"Finallyyy awesome egg waffles with unique flavours (durian, coconut, strawberry banana, matcha). I tried the coconut one and it was so good ! It wasn't just coconut flakes, there was like a coconut cream in each circle. Loved how the flavour gushed out when you took a bit. Will be back to try the other flavours!"}
{"text":"The egg waffles here are more expensive than other places but are of slightly better quality. But I find it extremely unsanitary for the man at the front to handle cash and then use his bare hands to put the waffles into the bags. Use tongs or wear gloves!!! The man also never gives an accurate estimate of wait times. The first time when it was really busy, he said around 10 minutes and took over 30 minutes. The second time was a bit better but still waited around 15 mins instead of the 6 mins he told me when ordering. Considering this is all they make, they know exactly how long it takes to make each waffle. It doesn't take a PhD in math to give a reasonably accurate estimate given the number of waffles on order and the number of waffle machines they have. So he probably does it on purpose to get extra business, which is not cool if you are in a rush! 

The original waffle is crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The matcha waffle is great since the slight bitterness from the matcha balances the sweetness from the waffle batter.

The chocolate and orange waffle is nice to try, but the waffle is already sweet and the chocolate just makes it a little too sweet for my taste.

Overall, the egg waffles here taste better than the ones I've had from Pacific Mall, ChaPlus, and the two places in the Kennedy T&T plaza (Toast Delight and Pop Up House). I don't mind paying the higher prices for a better waffle. However, they need to get more waffle machines to improve the wait time. The man also needs to start using tongs or gloves to handle the waffles instead of his bare hands, especially after handling cash. If those two things are addressed, I would consider becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"The smell of freshly baking waffles drew me in and before I  knew it, I had shelled out $11 for a matcha and a cheese bubble waffle. It takes about 10 minutes to make the waffles. This seems like an eternity when you're dying for that sweet, crispy yet chewy waffle. 

They ingeniously use hole punched paper bags for their hot freshly made waffles to allow the steam to escape. The staff/owner was helpful in suggesting flavours I might enjoy and in suggesting that I keep the paper bags containing the waffles open to maximize crispness.

The matcha waffle had that distinctive bitterness that I enjoy with matcha, yet had an almost paste like consistency inside the waffle bubbles. The cheese bubble waffle was filled with cream cheese. I was expecting more of a grilled cheese concept with stringy cheddar cheese inside, especially since the exterior of the cheese waffle resembles a pizza waffle.

A bit pricier than some waffle places, but the diverse flavour offerings (including durian, which is their number one seller) and quality of the waffles make the cost justifiable as an occasional treat."}
{"text":"[TASTE] - 3/5
I tried the matcha flavour HK egg waffle and the first few bites were really delicious and flavourful. The green tea flavour is definitely noticeable in every bite but half-way through eating it, the matcha flavour starts to become too overwhelming. Compared to other HK egg waffles, the texture of Eggette's are more hard and crispy. I tend to prefer my egg waffles to be light, fluffy, and of a softer texture so that's why I lowered the rating of my review by a bit. 

[SERVICE] 4/5
Aside from the taste, the service was a bit slow for a Monday afternoon. However, I was very pleased by how polite and welcoming the staff were to all of their customers."}
{"text":"Once again Eggette Hut did not disappoint me with their egg waffle, the ?bok bok egg waffle are perfect little bubbles! The crispy outter shell with a warm soft centre is just amazing!

After taking a couple bites I've decided to make a ??? with the egg waffle when I go home."}
{"text":"I saw a lot of buzz on the durian egg waffles so my durian loving self HAD to drag my butt to FMP, for the first time in years. It's in that corner that nobody visits so no people = it's a yes from me.

The line was very short but to my surprise, the prices were kind of insane. It was $6 for a durian egg waffle and around $4-5 for the other ones. Their profit margins must be insanely high.. knowing that pacific mall waffle places charge around $3 and still bank, this place is definitely taking advantage. Making that batter is dirt cheap + a few authentic ingredients, which if split up doesn't cost much either. In comparison to many other egg waffle spots in Markham, this might not last long once the hype dies down because other places sell them for cheaper.

The taste was strong in the durian and it was fresh, which I loved. Very yummy but it wasn't crispy on the outside like I had hoped, but instead more soggy like the cheaper egg waffles I've bought before. My favourite egg waffle spot is toast delight - they know how to make theirs perfectly each time. Don't get me wrong, this place was good but not the BEST I've had. I'd definitely grab it again, if I was in the area and in the mood for a durian treat but if I'm in no rush, I'd drive down the road to toast delight.

They have many other flavours too - matcha, seaweed/pork floss (yyuuUuUUUm), cheese, orange chocolate? It's not a bad addition to fmp, that's for sure. The man working was very friendly as well and took his time explaining things to other people that had questions."}
{"text":"Stopping by FMP, I wanted to try Eggette Hut out after hearing so many positive reviews. The cashiers were nice, patient and explained all of their options so service was definitely a plus! While my friend didn't LOVE the strawberry yogurt waffles, I thought they were really delicious and will be back soon to try their more popular flavours like durian (ahh!) and cheese explosion out. 

P.S. they have a waffle beside the cash register for display. Do not do what I did and ask for a sample - it's actually just for decor haha oops :')"}
{"text":"This newly opened hk waffle is located within first markham place. Their menu isnt too big, i think they have 9 flavours of bubble waffles to choose from and 3 other drinks. I got their durian flavoured bubble waffle for $5.31, and with tax it's $6. I came at 8ish pm on a Thursday evening and it wasnt too busy. The wait time was around 4-5 minutes. The bubble waffle came out crispy and hot. The actual waffle was hot, fresh, and crispy. However I was kinda dissapointed with the durian flavour. The flavour is there but the durian taste seemed to be a little watered down. When I first bite into the waffle the durian filling oozed out into my mouth so it was amazing. It would definitely be better if the durian flavour was a bit more rich. Like it smelled really good with the durian flavour but the smell doesn't match the taste. Service was friendly. Ill probably come back and try other flavours next time because their flavours are quite unique, such as cheese, strawberry yogurt, coconut, mango chocolate etc."}
{"text":"I came here after seeing multiple photos show up on my yelp feed. I love egg waffles and love the creative spin that dessert shops have been coming out with. I tried the matcha egg waffle, though i wanted to get the coconut one too. I appreciate that they took the time to put matcha filling into each bubble. Since matcha is such a strong flavor, I couldn't really taste the egginess of the waffle. The egg waffle is slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside so the texture is spot on for me. I would definitely come back to try the coconut one and maybe the cheese one too."}
{"text":"I think I found the best HK Egg Waffles place in Toronto.  Newly opened right at First Markham Place, I stumbled to this place when they first opened and was able to try some original flavours egg waffles.  I immediately knew it was the real deal because of how strong the egg flavour was and how crispy they are! Truly the HK experience where it's not super doughy, crispy, smells good and strong egg flavours.

Recently also tried the Cheese flavour and it is by far the best!  Although they are a little expensive, around $3.50-6.50 per egg waffles depending on the flavour you get, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I had to get their durian egg waffle. They put durian (100% fruit, nothing else according to the owner). Waffle shell was crispy on the outside. YUMMM. Friendly service, a bit pricey but so worth it."}
{"text":"Not what I expected. I asked the lady to make mines crispy but it wasn't, kinda soggy. Price wise it's kinda fair"}
{"text":"The durian egg waffle is FILLED with hot flavourful durian. So much more than expected! Will def go back and try other flavours."}
{"text":"Went the day before, wanted to try their mochi egg waffle, but they were sold out and said will be available again in June. They took their time to make sure the outside is crunchy enough before handing it to us, which is a good thing. In my opinion it's still not crunchy enough, it doesn't have the super crunchy shell and soft middle. I think it has to do with the receipe or the temperature of the plate."}
{"text":"i did try the cheese one and the green tea one,but i would like green tea more tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Update: the strawberry yogurt one was soggy because of the nature of the filling.. stay away from this flavour if you prefer crispy ones"}
{"text":"Calling all egg waffle lovers! This place inside of FMP took over Fruit Jungle and serves delicious filling gai dan jai. A little on the pricy end but the amount of filling makes up for it. 

I've tried pork floss and seaweed (delicious! go-to order), cheese explosion (yummy, but sadly it wasn't a favourite of mine), durian (fan favourite! everyone in my family loved it), and strawberry yogurt (delicious and definitely another go-to order). 

The people working here are super nice and they explain their menu very well. I can't wait to be back to try out their other flavours!"}
{"text":"This \"gai daan jai\" aka bubble waffle, eggette, egg waffles or whatever you call this just opened up about a week ago.  As a fan of this HK street food, I had to give it a try so I ordered the original flavour.  It's very crispy on the outside - light and chewy on the inside.  The sweetness was perfect too.  Price point is on the pricier side - which came to $4 for the original waffle.  I probably won't eat it everyday, but it could be something I would purchase on impulse.  Expect to wait about 3-4 minutes for it.  Add $2 and you can get a HK style drink too."}
{"text":"We stopped by before they closed and we were overwhelmed with the options! They use real durian in their egg waffles and the value is definitely there. The matcha waffle was so delicious! It was so flavorful and filled your mouth with all the matcha goodness!! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Eggette Hut - take my money! A classic Hong Kong snack with a twist. And it's not just a gimmick, despite its cute name and design. The quality is legit with tons of unique flavours and they don't skimp on the filling. It's rare that I get so excited over a snack and willingly visit repeatedly to try all the flavours. 

Some people prefer their egg waffle crispy, some like it soft. All I can say is that the egg waffles here are good (crisp yet soft, not dry) and my favorites to date are Original, Cheese and Matcha. 

If you want something savory, try the Cheese Explosion. It's quite a surprise. Sharp cheese on top (cheddar?) with a hot filing (cream cheese?) that oozes out. For something sweet, I like the Matcha, which has a prominent matcha filling rather than matcha powder mixed in the batter. However, I find that the waffle will be more wet with the Matcha & Coconut fillings. Original is a safe and solid choice for first-timers."}
{"text":"I saw all these pics from other yelpers on Eggette Hut and today I finally stopped by to grab a Hong Kong style egg waffle. 
I got an egg waffle with seaweed and pork floss. The waffle wasn't as sweet as I remember it being usually - this might be due to the seaweed and pork being there. Although the idea of the combination seems like it would be delicious, I'd say it's just ok. Original egg waffle without anything probably has a better taste. The waffle batter needs to be better - at least in my opinion. The price is reasonable and it takes a solid 8 minutes or more for them to make the waffle so this could create a bottleneck on busier days or on weekends. Room for improvement."}
{"text":"Hong Kong Egg Waffles? Okay, this is something new to me. My friend recommended and ordered the cheese so I guess that's what I'm having.

Unlike traditional waffles, these are shaped like a sheet of bubble wrap, like you're supposed to pop them. That would be fun!

I watched it being made and the process is very similar to traditional waffle making - pour the batter in, close the hinged top and rotate it. What was obviously different with this one is a piece of cheese in each \"ball\" and a sprinkling of cheese on the batter before closing and flipping.

The cheese had all melted and caramelized on one side, looking quite yummy. At first taste, the dough was a little on the sweet side. Nice. The cheese, however, didn't give me that salty, savoury contrast that I was expecting. It was a lot milder than it looked. I would have preferred a sharper cheese. Not bad though."}
{"text":"I got their combo; add a drink with the egglet for $2.  Their egglets (bubble waffles) have original plus eight flavors.  The owner talked me into getting banana.  The egglet was crispy on the outside with soft warm banana inside.  The moisture inside the bag built up pretty fast and some of the egglets had lost their crispiness before I was able to finish them (not sure if it's coz of the banana tho)  The owner is very friendly!  Will sure go back to try the original and other flavors."}
{"text":"Just saw this new HK bubble waffle joint. Had to try it out. OMG the matcha one was so good! There is matcha paste inside! I thought it was just going to be some matcha powder on the outside. Im going to come back and try the other flavors! CASH ONLY. BOO! I hate cash only. 1 star off. 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"Very tasty HK egg waffles! If that is what you are looking for, it does not disappoint. A had this a few times. It is soft in the inside and a little crunch on the outside. It is a great snack!"}
{"text":"As a lover of HK style egg waffles, how could I not try this place after seeing all the great reviews? I ordered the original and the durian one, and added $2 for an iced lemon tea. The iced tea was tasty, very much like the ones you get in HK cafes. As for the egg waffles, they didn't disappoint either. They were both very crispy on the outside, and soft inside, which I expect from good quality waffles. The original was light and not filling, and although it wasn't the best original waffles I've had, it was perfect because I also had the rich durian waffle to finish. For lovers of durian, you definitely must try the durian waffles here. Each eggette had durian purée inside, and it tasted fresh and flavourful. I will surely come back for the durian again and try the cheese explosion next time."}
{"text":"Was pretty excited to try this place based on the reviews but was disappointed! Definitely didn't taste like the ones in Hong Kong. I think I enjoyed the egg waffles from Chachago at Commerce Gate a lot more. 
I order the original and matcha flavors. The original was average. The matcha had some type of jam inside which tasted disgusting to me...ended up throwing it out after a few bites. Won't come back"}
{"text":"My Orders : Matcha Eggette, Seaweed and Pork Floss Eggette (my fave)

Pros
+ Food: It was so tasty and crispy! I loved the twists they offer on the age old eggette snack that I've grown up to know and love. I might not recommend the green tea one though, I found that one to be a bit odd. 
+ Service: friendly and patient 
+ Location

If you're feeling adventurous, try the durian eggette!"}
{"text":"The good thing about coming here right after work is that wait time was shorter. Waited about 5-10min since they make it fresh. 

Ordered a Durian egg waffle ($6 after tax)
You will enjoy it if you are a Durian Lover like me. You could really taste the Durian. $6 is reasonable for a Durian \"dessert\".  However if you are hoping to taste the actual egg waffle flavour, I would recommend getting another flavour (original or maybe coconut?), just because Durian is so strong that it trounced the \"cake\" flavour of the waffle. Overall, the texture is good and the portion is standard. I would come again to try another flavour."}
{"text":"I have to say firstly that I was quite pleasantly surprised at how tasty these \"egg waffles\" tasted!

This place is located near the most southern entrance to the interior of the First Markham Place mall - The entrance right beside the Tracy Desserts and where there's a sign for \"Shun Lee Herbs Trading Co\" hanging outside.

I honestly never ventured into this side of the mall usually, but upon seeing another persons review I decided I needed to give this place a try. 

In Cantonese, we would call this \"gai dan jia\" - Which the literal translation means \"Chicken Egg'lettes\". Having just written that, I guess it actually totally sounds like the name of the place - Eggettes! 

I know that in Hong Kong this is a pretty popular snack on the go. I would compare it to a type of sweet egg tasting waffle for the uninitiated with this  item and is classified more as a dessert item more then anything else.

But some things are truly lost in translation, so its better to just dive right in and give this place a try, as I do believe this may be a worthy evolution of the \"gai dan jia\".

The menu of this place is clean and simple with 9 different variations of their egg waffles.

Traditionally I have been dissapointed with getting this item, either because it comes out not crispy, or its just really doughy inside.

This place has attempted to evolve on the egg waffle by adding injected flavors into the waffle.

The batter of egg waffles is first put on the waffle maker, then depending on which flavor you choose they have a little squeeze tube of the flavor to put into each waffle crevice. 

If you take a look at my picture I think it makes a lot more sense then me trying to describe it at this point.

But the key thing is that the batter is not flavored itself. The batter is still the traditional \"egg waffle\" flavor, with the addition of the flavoring inside.

When we were standing in front, a male worker was kind enough to walk us through the different flavors and offerings. 

My other half and I ended up getting the \"cheese explosion\" as well as the \"durian\" flavor. It came out fresh and hot, with the exterior nice and lightly crispy with a very tasty creamy filling.

The cheese explosion tasted like it was almost cheesecake like to me, likely due to them using what tasted like cream cheese as well as some cheddar cheese. My other half said it tasted like mac and cheese to her. 

The durian was truely durian in all its egg waffle form glory. Meaning you can definitely taste the durian, and you can DEFINITELY smell it too. 

Overall, this was well worth the visit and I wouldn't hesitate to drop by anytime I wanted a nice light snack on the go while in the area.

If you have never tried \"gai dan jia\" before, then this place may be the best place for you first timers!"}
{"text":"Once again... hands down to this place ! This is the third time I visited this place and I finally had a chance to try their matcha egg waffle!!!

The matcha egg waffle had a prominent matcha flavour. For all the matcha lovers, you will LOVE this one! However, one minor thing was the matcha paste in the middle was a bit runny- I thought it would be more paste like. 

I can't wait to try the other flavours on the menu!"}
{"text":"First time I visited I was overwhelmed by the smell of fresh egg waffles cooking! I was practically drooling as I was waiting for my ride. Not even going to hide the fact that I rushed to the car and asked for cash to buy some when my ride was here.

I was not disappointed. I got 2 original, one for my ride home, and another for my sister. Mine was devoured in 3 seconds. And it was perfectly crunchy but also pillowy, with the perfect eggy taste! And luckily by the time I got home, aside from it not being warm anymore, my sister's retained the same crunchy exterior with pillowy centre!

I go there as often as I can now (usually during my lunch as I work 5 minutes away) and every time it is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Tried the cheese flavour and also the durian egg waffle. Both were very good. I liked the cheese waffle better. There was tons of cheese and for $5.50 its comparable price. I couldnt stop eating it and would order this again for sure. The durian waffle had lots of stinky durian fruit and done very well but not an egg waffle I would crave for again. Service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Just a friendly reminder this place is cash only.  It's located in a good plaza with a lot of different places to try out such as the cups. 

The waffles were really well cooked, with just the right amount of softness. I ordered the matcha one, which had a matcha paste inside. Tasted very similar to matcha mochi if you are a fan. Although it is pricey for around $6 an egg waffle, it's worth the experience. 

Friend ordered durian bubble waffle, considering she is a fan of durian, she really enjoyed it and finds herself craving it pretty often. With a fresh durian filling, it's definitely worth its price."}
{"text":"Think I've came across Toronto's most yummiest HK egg waffles. Most toppings are either dried up or intact onto these egg waffles at most places but at Eggette Hut, the fillings are still moist in every bite you take. There are several sweet and savory flavors to choose from. Will be back to try the cheese one. Price comes to around $4 to $6 each after tax. It's a few dollars more but you're ultimately paying for  the generous fillings they put into it."}
{"text":"Decent HK style egg waffles! The egg waffles are made fresh and available in several different flavours. The place seems really popular and have a lot of regular customers. I order the seaweed and pork floss flavoured waffle. Not bad and each waffle bubble did contain the ingredients. The waffle was crispy and they especially punched holes on the side of the paper bag to make sure the waffle doesn't become soggy which is pretty thoughtful. Looking forward to coming back to try other flavours

Update: I tried the coconut flavoured one and that's now my favourite! It has coconut paste inside each waffle bubble!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of egg waffles so I was very excited to try out this place. I've been quite a few times now and tried the original, matcha and banana waffle. For original waffle, I'd say that there was no significant difference from other stores and probably cheaper to get from other stalls in the foodcourt. The matcha waffle was quite nice with the strong matcha flavour mixed in. The winner for me however, is the banana bubble waffle. The bubble waffle was nice and hot out of the waffle maker. The bubble waffle was essentially filled with banana in the centre which oozed out from every bite and was so delicious. The banana is essentially a bit melted from the heat but nonetheless, the combination of waffle plus the banana inside is to die for! I am still thinking about how much I enjoyed that waffle as I write this review."}
{"text":"Good quality and service not too slow, although still could be faster. Plenty of waiting space while standing. You can choose from a wide variety of filling including fresh durian pieces, chocolate, explosive cheese, strawberry yogurt (which have would lost it probiotics in the baking heat anyway), plus a few more. The one handing money doesn't get to touch the food, which I appreciate. Been to too many places where they take your cash and make your food with the same bare hands or gloves. The fillings are not skimpy but they come with a price tag.  Eggettes are crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Good flavor.  There are too many that are made too slow, and/or too dry,  and/or are too blant in taste.  Their paper bags are 
prepunched to vent the moisture."}
{"text":"Dropped by First Markham Place for lunch at the food court then I remembered I have bookmarked this place. Luckily, I was in the mood for dessert. 

Suggestion flavours based on the orders I heard others ahead purchased: seaweed and pork floss, cheese and fresh durian. 

Besides the flavours already mentioned, I would try matcha too. 

Ordered the durian egg waffles ($6). From the time of ordering and receiving the waffles took about 5 minutes. Soft and creamy durian inside the pockets of the egg waffle. Durian is a taste not everyone will like.. I don't like durian or dislike it. But it was recommended by the person at the cash register. I didn't mind it. You can smell the durian from the bag without even tearing into the waffle. 

Nice warm puffy waffles hot off the iron. These are aren't too sweet and they're fluffy. It's crispy golden on the outside with soft and airy pockets. The egg waffles are good even when they have cooled down. They are the best when fresh off the iron waffle maker of course! 
It's fun to rip each waffle pocket off.. just one by one. 

Friendly staff. Only a takeout place. 

The paper bag the waffle comes in.. I like that there are these tiny holes along the bottom side of the bag so steam can escape - keeping the waffle crispier longer. 

These waffles will satisfy the cravings if you really want durian egg waffles. The portion size of the waffle is decent. Perfect for sharing! Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Noticed this place inside FMP and had to give it a try.. the owner is very friendly and took the time to explain that the eggettes are actually \"filled\" with a puree/real fruit in each flavor instead of mixed into the batter..interesting concept but I stuck to the regular eggette ($4 after tax).

The eggette was delicious and flavourful..crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Will definitely be back to try the durian one!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feeling about this place, it's tasty but I would say I've tried better. I've tried the yogurt, chocolate and original over the past month. I always end up buying Eggette on my way out as a treat.

My favourite is the chocolate flavour, on the menu it says chocolate mixed orange but you can request no orange. 

The wait time I've experienced was about 3 mins on a good day to 10 mins on a Saturday.

It ranges from $4-6 depends on what flavour you buy. My only problem I had was when I bought the original it was SO HOLLOW as if they meant to put a flavour filling but realized I only wanted original.....So I had a hollow waffle because they messed up. it typically has more of a thick bread but mine was so light and empty it just didn't make sense. I know how it tastes since I purchased it before as mentioned in the review.

It sure wasn't worth the wait and I definitely have to find some place else that has the same concept in the area."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of HK egg waffles and am I ever glad that I finally got to try out this place. Eggette Hut is located inside First Markham Place, where a BBT joint used to be. What I noticed when I got to the booth was that there was something on the wall that read that this was a chain that was originated from HK. 
There were quite a few flavours for the egg waffles and I decided to try the Durian one. I wasn't thirsty that time, but you could add $2 to your order for a drink.

The durian egg waffle was good ($6 tax in). There was quite a strong durian smell when you bite into it. For someone who doesn't really prefer or enjoy durian but still want to eat it, I think this would be a good way to try. However, for those who are in love with durian, the taste of this waffle might not be enough. 

The service was good. There was about a 5 minute wait for the egg waffle to be ready and it will definitely take longer if there was a line up. 

I would definitely come back to try the cheese and matcha one, along with their HK milk tea. 

For those who are looking to add toppings or icecream to your waffles, unfortunately they don't have that (yet). Perhaps they might do that in the future?"}
{"text":"Ordered the seaweed and pork floss. The egg waffles were golden and super delicious. Definitely one of the better bubble waffles places I've ever been too. I've ordered the strawberry yogurt and the original egg waffles before and the stuffed yogurt filling is creative and a great choice. Definitely in a great location within first Markham place."}
{"text":"Small little shop located inside First Markham Place. Been here a couple of times. We tried both the egg waffles and the drinks. Our favourite flavour was the original. We've also tried the cheese and the matcha flavoured egg waffles. The cheese one was okay but didn't really match our liking. It was both sweet and savoury. As for the matcha one, we didn't like the texture. The matcha filling had the texture of red bean paste. Which we didn't like so much. 

The original flavour was the best in our opinion. It was simple yet good. The egg waffle was crispy yet soft on the nice inside. 

As for drinks. The drinks were pretty bad. We tried the hk lemon tea and the honey lemonade. Something about both of them was weird. It has an odd flavour to it. 

Overall, there's nothing surprising about this place. If you're around the area then it's nice to drop by. But we would not go out of our way to try this place."}
{"text":"I really liked the durian waffles from Eggette Hut, the amount of durian they are able to fit inside is amazingly delicious. They make them fresh so you need to wait approx 5 min 

I also tried the matcha waffles but I found them a letdown because the matcha tasted a little dry and chalky (I think it's because the matcha filling isn't thick and gooey enough) but it is better than the one at The Dessert Kitchen."}
{"text":"I walked in thinking i'd only order one egglet as the prices were quite high ($6 for durian and $6 for porkfloss)... but since I was in line everyone ordered durian so I had to too!  The egglets were crispy in on the edges but each bubble was so soft! It was impressive because each bubble piece actually had filling inside. They \"inject\" the filling into each piece and add a lot - making it more worth the price (at least as a treat once in a while)

The man at the cashier was very nice and seems to really take the product seriously as he would always advise his customers how to store the product to ensure the quality. He also gives you an approximate time it will take so you don't have to wait around if you choose to walk around. It is also located right by the entrance so you don't have to go far."}
{"text":"I came here with my coworkers after work yesterday, just before 6pm. No line ups :) The gentleman who works there was very patient when explaining the product to us and gave us a brief history about the Chef who owns this new bubble waffle joint in Markham.

Originated from North Point, Hong Kong, the Chef has over 30 years of experience in bubble waffle making. This is the first overseas store - thank you for opening in FMP :D Great choice! They are known for putting in fresh filling into each bubble waffle to create that unique (explosive) experience in each bite.

There are 9 flavours to choose from. You can also make it a combo with a drink +$2. We tried the original, matcha and durian. It was very nice of the gentleman to split the bubble waffles into halfs, so I could share with my coworkers. From the first bite of the original, the outside of the bubble waffle is crispy and the inside is light and soft. But you must enjoy the bubble waffle on the spot because it will get soggy if you leave it out for too long.

Matcha one is a popular choice, and it is usually the safest bet if you want to try something with a filling. I enjoyed it very much :) My coworker thought it might be on the bitter side but that's what makes it legit lol.

Durian one is something I would order once in a blue moon. I would definitely share this one! The flavour is very strong (can be considered smelly for some!), and each bite has real durian fruit in it. I would order this one again if anyone wants to share with me!

The gentleman also mentioned that the Cheese Explosion flavour is only available in Canada. It is made with a light milk cheese inside and topped with a crispy outter layer of chedder cheese. I will definitely try this one next time ;) Keep up the good work, Eggette Hut!

P.S. There is a stamp card as well. Every 6 bubble waffle you buy, you get 1 free :) Happy bubble waffle eating :D!

UPDATE (03/19/18)
I finally tried the Cheese Explosion! Not exactly a fan of the milk cheese inside (although it is really light!), I did enjoy the crispy cheddar outside. I think I would prefer a brie filling - but that would be costly to make. I have also tried the Strawberry Yogurt. Not a fan either, sorry! I taste more yogurt than the strawberry. I will stick with Matcha and Original for now. I heard Chocolate Orange is the sweetest one of all. Get that one if you prefer something sweeter!"}
{"text":"Always great egg waffles. Priced well. Always a line up because of how good they taste! Can't get enough!"}
{"text":"I got the durian waffle which is definitely not for everyone especially if you don't like / not sure if you like durian - because with every pop of the bubble waffle, there was an aromatic smell of durian. (Sorry to those of you who hate durian and had to read that.) 

The waffle itself though was tasty - soft and crunchy in all the right places.

Definitely want to go back and try some of the savour flavours (pork floss and seaweed, cheese)"}
{"text":"Love this new addition to First Markham Place! 

Located all the way to one corner inside the mall, Eggette hut is a welcome addition to this busy plaza. I ordered a chocolate egglet as well as the matcha one and I really enjoyed both.

This is a takeout spot, there is no dining in available, although there is a large food court with tons of tables if you go towards the centre of the mall. The egglets ranged in priced from around $4-$5, two of ours came to $10. The ladies working at the booth are so sweet and friendly. 

The actual egglets are great! Crispy on the outside and chewy and soft on the inside. What I particularly enjoyed about these ones compared to other places was the fact that the individual eggs were actually filled with the chocolate or matcha and not just sprinkled into the batter while it's being cooked. I loved having that explosion of matcha paste or melty chocolate in each bite. 

The only issue is how slowly these things are made, we were the only people in line when we went but we waited around 6-8 minutes to get ours, I can't imagine how they'd deal with a lineup, might have people waiting for a while. I understand that they make them fresh and i'm not entirely sure what the solution would be, maybe they'll invest in some more irons once they get busier. Since it's located inside of a mall, you can order and take a quick walk around the mall and come back to your fresh egglet. 

Overall these egglets are delicious, light snacks, perfect to grab after dinner, for breakfast, any time actually! Go get one now!!"}
{"text":"Being a big fan of Hong Kong style egg waffles, discovering new places to try is definitely one habit! 

We asked what's their bestseller here and the staff recommended us the durian flavour. I don't really eat durian much but if it's their bestseller, I mean why not give it a try right? My first bite was quite surprising because it taste like the durian was exploding inside my mouth which is quite interesting and the flavour of durian isn't those ones that I can't take. 

However even though my boyfriend is not a picky eater like me and eat durians occasionally, we can't finish one order of durian egg waffle because the durian is just too sweet that we can't eat anymore after few bites that we had to throw away almost half of it. But overall it's a pretty joyful experience! I might come and try other new flavours in the future!"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5
Located in First Markham Place beside Entrance E (for those who are familiar with FMP, this place replaced Fruit Jungle Bubble Tea). 

[SERVICE] - 5/5
The owner was very personable & offered samples of fresh original waffles while my boyfriend and I waited for our order. He also mentioned the best Egglet flavours are (1) Cheese Explosion & (2) Fresh Durian. So, give those a try! 

[DÉCOR] - 4/5
No seating area in the direct vicinity, but good for a snack on-the-go, or you can sit down at seating area in the food court. 

[FOOD QUALITY] - 5/5
High-quality ingredients, most authentic Hong Kong style egg waffle in the GTA. Egg waffles are supposed to be crispy on the outside & soft on the inside, but other egg waffle vendors around here only offer softer & soggy ones.

[ORDER]
- Cheese Explosion Egglet - $5.13: hot, fresh, crispy on the outside and literally a cheese explosion on the inside. The melted cheese oozed out after each bite. 

[OVERALL] - 5/5
I would definitely recommend the Cheese Explosion Egglet because it changes the egg waffle game and takes it to a whole new level! Next time, I will toughen up & try the Fresh Durian Egglet."}
{"text":"Durian lovers, meet Eggette Hut!

Eggette is located where the bubble shop used to be (theyre not in the food court, but actually where the ginseng place at the south end of the plaza). Theres quite a bit of traffic building up there so you cant really miss it, plus its super yellow.

They are known for their durian (you read that right) and banana egg waffles. You get the regular waffles but with some serious durian injections in every little bubble. Its creamy and sweet, but doesnt overpower the egg waffle flavour. Its a bit on the pricey side at almost $6 a waffle, but it is worth a try.

Their menu isnt too big now, but cant wait until/if they add more flavors!"}
{"text":"Such a cute new egg waffle joint in Markham!
Fell in love with the adorable icon and shop décor. You smell the aroma of fresh egg waffles immediately after walking in.

I have tried the matcha flavored one which was a bit too sweet for me. The matcha was very strong however, and every piece was generously filled.
The original one is always great, with a very strong egg flavor that not many places have anymore.
The cheese was one of the recommended ones, definitely a must try! 
The cheese was perfectly melted inside the waffle and just crispy on the outside. The waffle is savory and very flavorful with the mix of different cheeses. 
I personally really loved the strawberry yogurt one! Such a unique variation of the traditional egg waffle. The strawberry flavor is very prominent and gives a very yummy fruity and tangy taste to the waffle. The yogurt also adds a creaminess to the waffle which really complements the soft waffle. 

The prices seem a bit higher at first, but seeing that every waffle was really generously filled, the price is really worth it! Each piece was filled with toppings and full of flavor. Compared to many other egg waffle joints, the prices are similar but this place gives you the bang for your buck!

Overall really satisfied with the egg waffles! Great choice of unique flavors as well as the original one which you cannot go wrong with. Will definitely try the other flavors, highly recommend everyone to give this new place a try."}
{"text":"Pork floss and seaweed egg waffle ($5.31)
I should have took a picture of the inside because this egg waffle had its pork floss and seaweed ingredients exploding out. Can't complain! It was really tasty! Loved it. Other egg waffle places have the same flavour but none of them give this much ingredients so definitely better bang for ur buck here."}
{"text":"Here is definitely my favorite place for egg waffle! Literally i visit this store at least once a week, their coconut, cheese and durian flavours are my top pick! Love ittttttttttt!"}
{"text":"After seeing pictures from my friends on instagram about this egg waffle, I have to definitely give it a try. Egg waffles have been a favourite for me since I was a little girl in HK. When it comes to egg waffles, the only flavour- original, was the only flavour existed in my mind. But flavoured ones? I HAVE to give it a try. 

Came here on a Sunday after (around 3pm), already a mini line and many people waiting. Ordered durian and matcha. I was told it would be a 10 mins wait, which was understandable given the amount of people waiting.

The egg waffle itself was really crispy yet soft and gooey inside. The durian was tasty, and was told by my mother, who was the one to finish it, that each egg has durian \"meats\" inside. I took a little tiny bites of it as I was not a fan of the fruit, it has a really strong flavour already from that little bite. My mom loved it. Durian fans, this is for you!!!

The matcha was my favourite. I thought it would be the outside that tasted like matcha but nope, it was better than I imagined. Each egg was filled with matcha paste. Perfect amount of sweet- not overpowering at all. But it did have the bitter aftertaste like all matcha products have. However, just a slight disappointment- the filling doesn't taste like \"matcha\" but more chinese green tea. 

The waffles really need to be eaten when they were still fresh and hot. We saved some for a bit and they were not crispy and got soggy. The paper bags were hole punched to let them breathe, so that it would not create condensations and ruin the waffle's texture."}
{"text":"Great eggettes, especially for the price. This is relatively new establishment at First Markham Place and has seen lines in front of the store since they opened. I've tried their plain, matcha, and durian flavours. An underrated aspect of their eggettes is that they retain their shape even as it cools. Maybe it's the design of their bags to release steam? But as other places may see their eggettes deflate or wrinkle up due to the steam, Eggette Hut's stay crisp on the outside for the entire time you're finishing them.

The durian eggette, in particular, was amazing because you can really taste the chunks of durian inside. It's not just a flavouring, you get the actual fruit inside. When it's fresh it's a nice molten centre to bite into. This is probably my new favourite place to go for HK style egg waffles (eggettes)."}
{"text":"This is not Hong Kong egg waffle,  I tried the basic one and after few bites I throw it.  The basic waffle is harder to make it than with flavor waffle. I would save my money to Toast delight or go to commerce gate there to get egg waffle."}
{"text":"Eggette Hut give you a taste of Hong Kong's famous Egg Waffles in Markham!

I do love the different flavours they offers. But my heart had decided on durian already. As a durian lover, I was not disappointed as each little eggette has a piece of durian! 

If you love your eggette super crispy outside and soft and fluffy inside, give Eggette Hut a try!

Love the special designed paper bags that have holes so the egg waffles would stay nice and crispy!

Owner is super friendly! Thanks for being my hand model while I took a photo of my beautiful egg waffles!"}
{"text":"Went to First Markham place because I heard there was a new egg waffle place there. I expected it to be food court, but after some wasted time circling the inner centre, I found that it's actually at one of the far ends of the mall (near the restaurants side).

We first ordered a matcha waffle then a cheese one. The matcha was \"eh\". It was really good at first but then I kinda got sick of the over bearing matcha flavour. The cheese one was very good. Every bite was delicious.

Next time, I would like to try the durian waffle. I overheard some people talking about it while waiting for my orders. They mentioned it was their favourite and it was made of real durian."}
{"text":"After passing by this place numerous times when I'm at First Markham Place i just had to finally give it a try. The first thing to hit you as you approach the store is the sweet aroma of the egg waffle wafting through the air. It's definitely a smell that you can't ignore as it makes your mouth water. They had a pretty good range of options from the plain waffle, cheese, coconut, matcha and the ever popular durian flavor. The prices varied depending on which flavor with durian being the most expensive flavor. Me being a HUGE matcha lover had to of course order the matcha egg waffle which was $5.00 with tax. Keep in mind it seems at this time they only accept cash and no credit/debit. I didnt have to wait very long and they made my waffle fresh right on the spot. Once they handed me the waffle the first thing I noticed was that the matcha filling was oozing out from the sides of the waffle which was a good sign. After the first bite I was hooked. It was like a matcha explosion! They were so generous with the filling and the matcha flavor was intense! I loved how it was crispy on the outside but not too hard and the inside was soooo soft and warm. Highly recommend! I can't wait to come back and try the other flavors. Also they do have a special where drinks are $2.00 with purchase of any waffle."}
{"text":"I had their cheese explosion eggette, it was delicious. Too bad it is $6 after tax...
That's double of what I used to paying at the traditional eggette place.
But I admire the way they try new flavours instead of the original flavour I always had for the past 20 years.
Hopefully they will continue to have new ways to improve their craftsmanship"}
{"text":"TLDR 
4.5 stars for having a good amount of real durian in the waffles... Minus a star for pricing and softer waffles. Total, 3.5 stars.

Finally made my way to Eggette Hut in First Markham Place to try their Durian Egg Waffle ($6 taxes in) and it was amazing! The waffles are made fresh to order which explodes with the most delicous ooey gooey durian filling when you bite into it. I've never thought that I would like hot durian but it was fantastic - heating it up actually makes the flavour even sweeter and the texture more creamy. The only critique I have was that the waffle itself was not as aromatic as some other places (but then again, it might be that the durian was so fragrant that it covered the taste of the waffle). Some might say that $6 is a little expensive for egg waffles but considering the price of durian these days and the amount of durian in every eggette, I think it is well worth it.

I went back a second time to try their Cheese Explosion ($6 taxes in) and found it good but probably not worth the price. The outside of the waffle was a little soft and the inside looks like it has a white cheese filling that tastes a lot like cheddar. 

The rest of their menu ranges from $3.79 to $6 (before taxes) which is quite pricey. For their premium Seaweed and Pork Floss flavour, I think I would prefer to head on over to Woofles and Cream and for the regular waffles, I'm content with the ones at PMall. Eggette Hut will be reserved exclusively for durian from now on."}
{"text":"Recommending to eat all eggettes hot, as it is the most flavourful that way. 
I have tried the green tea as well as the original eggettes, and if you like green tea, I would recommend you get the matcha flavoured one. I remember biting into it, and the flavour was super strong. Then I realized the inside was still molten like, so it leaked all over my shirt. lol. 

Definitely have the qualities of a great eggette, soft on the inside, with little crispy bits on the outside."}
{"text":"Had the matcha and seaweed with pork floss egg waffles. I liked how the ingredients were evenly distributed but the taste was terrible and it was missing the fluffiness of normal egg waffles. Matcha was overly bitter and the pork floss one was weirdly salty and sweet. Definitely not a good combination. It was so bad, I had to throw it out after few bites. Everything else in the food court looked 100x better. 

Not worth $11 for two egg waffles. The original ones at pacific mall are much better."}
{"text":"Eggette Hut is the charm of FMP! While there's plenty of food choices outside the mall, there's barely anything good inside. I was very excited to try this place because I love egg waffles, but I almost always prefer the original flavour.

I came here on a weekday after work and there was no line. They were very nice and took time to explain their egg waffle process to us and also explained each flavour and what kind of people may prefer which.

Matcha is the \"safe\" choice - this is what I ordered. Each bubble has matcha paste filling. It's crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. It was great but like all matcha, it has a bitter aftertaste.

Orange Chocolate is their sweetest one, followed by Strawberry Yogurt. Seaweed & Pork Floss is one of their savoury options. The Cheese Explosion is filled with milk cheese (lighter and healthier), with cheese on the outside as well. 

Original - My colleague ordered this and it was light and crispy. Although I normally prefer original, I would choose one of the other flavours at this store because they do the flavoured ones so well and they don't cheap out on the filling.

The fruit flavoured ones are filled with fresh fruit. We got durian and it was delicious. I honestly didn't think I would like it. I like the actual fruit but I usually don't like it made any other way. To my surprise, the durian tasted delicious! I thought warm durian would be gross but I can't wait to go back and order this!

You should definitely finish the waffle while it's still warm. I let mine sit for a bit and the bubbles got soggy from the filling. However, I did pop it into the oven for a little bit and it was all good. Yay!

I also like that they hole punch their paper bags so there is room for the egg waffles to \"breathe\" and it doesn't get soggy as quickly. This small detail shows how attentive they are!"}
{"text":"TLDR: really good when eaten fresh!

Oh boy, where do I start. My friend and I came here on a Saturday afternoon, we both ordered our own Eggette: fresh durian and cheese explosion. 

I was so excited when we got it, it was made very nicely, packaging was cute, eggette was really hot, and when you bite into it, the insides of each eggie was durian custard, and for the cheese explosion, cream cheese! It was so yummy when it was eaten hot. The cheese explosion was more salty than sweet, nonetheless, it was great. BUT, both the eggettes got kind of sickening after eating about 1/3 of the eggette... i think it is best to share, maybe one eggette was too overpowering for one person! If you do not eat it right away, the inside filling of the Eggies do get hard. 

Anyways, the prices were pretty decent. I will be back to try their other flavours :)"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with this place. I got the original egg waffles to try its flavour before trying other flavours. Unfortunately it was a little on the top crispy side so it was a little overdone for me. I prefer the egg waffles on the softer and fluffier side. I've definitely had better. I'd probably give it another try to see if it happens again."}
{"text":"The egglet is legit! It reminds me of the days when I had to beg my mom so hard to buy me this on the street in my hometown. Have tried other egg waffle places in gta, i was surprised to see they have so many variations. Plus the fine interior design and super friendly staffs, this place really brings this traditional street snack to a whole new level. What's the Littest to me is the TRUE flavour. I got the fresh durian one and my gf had the cheese explosion(sketchy name lol). Besides the good-looking and very crispy surface, there are also sufficient fillings inside every single 'egg' and the cheese one was the best ever hands down. According to the staff, they use fresh fruits to make their flavours and I do believe cuz my taste dont lie. The milk tea I got was also true and savory too. If you never try hk milk tea, def try cuz its different. 

It was overall a fantastic experience. Hyped to see one of my fav childhood snacks gets upgraded and gains lots of population(which made me wait for a gd 10 mins). But if they can keep making goods, I wont mind spending the extra mins when i come back next time. Highly recommended. 5 stars."}
