{"text":"I love, love, love India Darbar.  Chicken Tikka Masala addict that I am, I've found theirs to be the best I've ever had.  The one other dish I've had - Chicken Mughlai - was superb as well.   To me, no Indian meal is complete without a mango lassi and lots of warm, pillowy naan, both of which are excellent.  The service is great as well.  The only negative thing I can say is that the one time I wrote a check (having lost my debit card), it took them almost 3 weeks to cash it - but I can't find it within me to take away a star for it, since having checks \"hanging  out there\" is just my own neurosis."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like India Darbar based on the other reviews here, but it just wasn't what I was hoping for. It's not the anything about the restaurant was bad - the service was good, the food was good, the lunch buffet selection was good - it just wasn't great. The location of the restaurant is in an out-of-the-way strip mall off Odana. We were greeted at the door immediately, but the place was empty except for two other tables. I ordered masala chai to drink. I prefer more milk in mine for a richer flavor, but this had less milk and more tea. It didn't have a lot of the cardamom, cinnamon or cloves that make it masala chai. The naan that came with the meal was thin and crispy almost like pizza crust. I prefer mine more pillowy and a little chewy. It had a little spice baked into it, but it lacked the light brush of oil on top for a little extra something. The entrees were like everything else, good but not great. The sauces were thinner than usual - I like them a little thicker so you can pick them up with the naan or eat them with the rice. The entrees also lacked the spices Indian food is famous for. The just weren't quite what they should have been.  When I finished eating, the staff cleared the table and brought the check in a timely but not rushed manner. Though, we had to wait a minute or two to pay with there now only one other table in the restaurant filled. Overall, India Darbar deserves the four stars. It was better than average, but not excellent. I would try it once, but then drive a few more blocks down Odana to Maharaja."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch!!!!!! I have been there 3 times now and I always have a good experience. I always eat the buffet, the chicken and lamb dishes are always really good. I don't care for the paneer (not enough chunks of paneer). When you go you'll have to try the Indian Chi Tea it's the best I have had in Madison. Overall it is one of the best restaurants on the west side."}
{"text":"This is no longer the Darbar it is now called Turmeric Restaurant. The food was OKAY at best. We were all set coming from Colorado (very limited Indian food) to a restauart touted with great Indian food here in Madison. We should have walked out when we entered at 7:30pm and the place was empty except for my husband and I. The service was poor and it took us over 2-hours for our meal to be finished. Slow service is great at times, but we just flew in and were tired. The price were over the top for the quality of food and the service. We won't be going back on the trip."}
{"text":"If you have an Indian food craving in this fair city, I insist you go to India Darbar.  For lunch, they have a well stocked buffet with an amazingly large selection.  (for a good price)  However, during dinner times ordering off of the menu proves to be a wonderful treat.  Entrees are served in these lovely silver dishes and everything I have ever can only be described as perfectly spiced fabulousness.  The service is always attentive without being overbearing.  Try it, you will not be disappointed. (Also drive attentively-- it's easy to miss off of Odana.)"}
{"text":"Wow!  I had high expectations when I picked this restaurant, and I was not disappointed.  My husband ordered the chicken tikka masala, which was great.  We shard the allo gobi, which was very good.  I ordered the chicken kashmiri khorma and some nan.  The chicken was one of best dishes I have ever had!  It was out of this world!  I also ordered Masala tea, and it was very good.  The service was excellent, and the prices were appropriate.  I would definitely recommend it."}
