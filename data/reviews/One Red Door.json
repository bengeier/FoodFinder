{"text":"Great ambience and service! but disappointed at lack of veg options and how expensive the few dishes were."}
{"text":"I ate there last week and was surprised to find that even while with no reservation, they could easily fit me in. The hostess, Catherine, greeted me with a big smile. And to add to my content with the hostess, my waitress, Mary made my experience just that much better. Some unique choices of foods but overall I am glad I came in."}
{"text":"Went there again this weekend after swearing off the place after my first visit, and only because Flip Side next door was jammed.  Shouldn't have.  Place was pretty empty, but service was in no hurry.  My wife and I had drinks and burgers: both from Flip Side.  Manhattans were decent (a bit too sweet), burgers were fine as they come from next door (we did not get the menu burger but just created our own as if we were at Flip Side).  But weirdly they didn't bring any mustard or ketchup, and then when we asked for them they brought tiny little plastic cups, so we had to ask for more twice.  But the real shocker was the appetizer we ordered upon sitting down.  It was this thing called Warm Castelvetrano Olives.  It was a pile of indifferently arranged warm seeded olives on a bed of orange segments and pickled onions with honey drizzled on it.  It was the kind of dish that makes you wonder if the chef ever tastes his own food.  I can honestly say it was the worst dish I have had in a restaurant in a long, long time.  I only mention it because serving something like that sends a message about how a restaurant is run, and it's not good.  I can now say for sure I will not go back."}
{"text":"We recently went for a Saturday night dinner out.  Ambiance was nice but it grew REALLY loud as the place filled up.  We had a table close to the kitchen which was fine except there was little space for the people walking behind me to pass, resulting in more than one bump or elbow.  Our server (Kelly Anne) was exceptional, always right on top of everything with a smile to boot!  The food was quite good but not quite OMG good. My hanger steak was tasty but a bit tougher than I had hoped.  The accompanying potatoes au grat were dry and crispy.  My wife's pork chop was superb as were her butternut squash fritters.  Drinks were good if not a bit pricey.  We avoided apps and desert so I can't comment on those.  Traditionally, were regulars at another establishment around the corner that offers a bit more of an upscale experience.  We both agreed that ORD was enjoyable but didn't make the list of \"We must come back soon!\""}
{"text":"We've tried ORD three or four times since it opened, and we are not impressed.  First, there is no real separation between the bar and the dining room, and the bar is always noisy and crowded.  The menu has hardly changed in 3 years and, having ruled out several items we've tried in the past, there's not much left that sounds appealing.  Our waiter explained that the small plates are not what you might expect, and they would not be a substitute for dinner even if you ordered more than one of them.  The menu is divided in an odd way--trendy, I guess--but difficult to figure out what is meant by the titles of some sections.  Last visit, I ordered the skirt steak, which is usually a safe choice, medium rare, and it arrived nearly raw.  Bluish color raw.  There is a lot of restaurant competition in Hudson, and several other places that have this place beat by a mile."}
{"text":"Great meal, lovely ambiance, attentive services. Menu changes seasonally. Enjoyed brussells, green salad and the short rib, which was to die for. Included mashed parsnip, squash and a delicious butter sauce. Our kids joined us, but this is probably a better place to bring kids earlier in the day. We hopped off I-80 from PA to MI and definitely worth the trip. The setting and community of Hudson is quaint and pleasant. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Such an improvement on the previous restaurant in that location. Have had a number of appetizers and small plates at the cozy, charming bar and have loved all of them. The moscow mule is fantastic, along with either the fondu, cheese board, burger, Mac and cheese or fries with truffle aoli. The service is prompt and friendly and it's definitely worth a trip to check it out."}
{"text":"The boo and I stumbled upon this while walking around the shopping center and decided to stop in for drinks and snacks.  I forgot the name of my cocktail, but it was a gin and blackberry puree concoction and it was HEAVEN. it's easily one of my favorite cocktails ever.  For snacks, we had the ahi tuna taco, deviled eggs, and the lobster gnocchi gratin. The ahi tuna taco is tiny--tiny as in you can eat it in two bites! It is served with a wasabi avocado puree. Less is more here. You only need a little bit to give the taco some flavor. The deviled eggs were good but nothing you haven't had before at a cookout or party. I highly recommend the lobster gnocchi gratin as it was tasty! Lobster, gnocchi, asparagus, and peas. The dish definitely could have used more gnocchi though.  Some of the prices are a bit high in my opinion.."}
{"text":"If you look for my review of Rosewood Grille, you'll know that we arrived at One Red Door serendiptiously. And we're so glad we did. Although the restaruant was bustling and busy, we were immediately seated at a booth in the bar which was quite comfortable.  Service was excellent. Attentive and friendly without being overly so. Our calamari app was lightly dusted and delicious. The tomato/mozz caprese was good although the tomatoes were a little flavorless, odd in Ohio in August.   Two of us had the farmer's pasta which was terrific. The grilled vegetables added a smokiness to the dish. The fettucine fresh and perfectly cooked and the light wine sauce pulled the elements together nicely. The portion itself looked a bit small in the bowl but turned out to be the perfect serving size. The lobster roll got a good review from one in our party and the salmon ordered by the other person in our party got a thumbs up between mouthfuls. We finished our meal with the warm peach, caramel tart with vanilla ice cream and practically fought over the last bites. The peaches were soft but not mushy, the crunchy topping gave nice contrast and the ice cream made the dessert taste like summer.  We'll be back to test the fall menu. THis place is a winner."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Wife and I stopped in while randomly looking for someplace to eat. Impressed by nice atmosphere, and the decor. Charcuterie tray was good, good cocktail and beer selection. Several entrees sounded excellent. the stuffed pork chop that I got was honestly one of the best meals I've ever had,  and we've done a lot of fine dining. Wife got the walleye and said it was good but not awesome. I'll go back and there's no way I'm not getting that pork chop again."}
{"text":"Service was ok food bland  French onion soup sucked over priced will not return"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my experience at this restaurant.  It was far too pricey for what it was, the food did not meet the quality expected(very salty), and the portion sizes were extremely small.  Service was slow, we were served a glass of wine with several chunks of cork in it, and there were fruit flies all around.  I must admit the ambiance and atmosphere are very pleasant, but certainly do not make up for other aspects of the restaurant that are lacking. Hopefully this was one rare bad experience but I am sure I will not be returning to this place, which is unfortunate since the location is so ideal to locals from Hudson."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and had an amazing salad. They offer a ton of yummy \"small plates\" that I will definitely have to come back for. Wasn't surprised to see this made the Cleveland Top 100 list in 2015."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance. Sat outside and enjoyed the patio.  Sampled the happy hour menu.  Wings were good.  Stuffed date with chorizo good, a bit salty.  The steak lettuce wraps were ok, very tiny even at 3.50/ea.  Shared a gluten free pizza.  Pizza was good for gluten free, way too much rice flour on the bottom though.  After we had eaten half the pizza I noticed some spots on the bottom crust (see pic).  Brought to the attention of the staff. They said it was char marks from the oven.  I thought it was mold but they disagreed. None the less they did not charge for it."}
{"text":"Much better atmosphere than the restaurant it replaced, and my lunch was lovely, though not breathtaking. The presentation could use a little work I guess -- food tasted much better than it looked. Need to return for a dinner, but the point is that I'll be returning."}
{"text":"We visited One Red Door for my boyfriends B-Day this past week, what a huge disappointment. The place has a pretty cool atmosphere even though the night we went was quiet. I had a stomach ache and the bartender offered to make me a complementary drink with bitters, which was very nice. I ordered the Plantain Crusted Gulf of Mexico GROUPER / local goat cheese tamale / blistered pepperdew / lime pomegranate vinaigrette $28. It took awhile to get out food which is fine, but when it came out, the Grouper was dry and served on a bed of peppadew peppers that were supposed to have the seeds removed and stuffed with cheese, that's what blistered peppadew is, they weren't, the seeds made the dish way too hot to eat. BTW, they added leeks to this dish as well, WTH? The other major disappointment was my dish was supposed to come with a tamale stuffed with goat cheese, which never appeared on my plate even though the bartender, we ate at the bar, said it did. After a conversation and the bartender saying she was sorry that she didn't mean to be confrontational, the meal was removed from my bill and the remainder of my dinner was thrown in the trash per my request. My boyfriends meal wasn't perfect either but I'll let him tell it like it is. Needless-to-say, we won't be going back there. Definitely no Michelin Stars here."}
{"text":"We have been going to One Red Door once a week for lunch for the past couple of years. The staff has been friendly, they are never busy for lunch and the food has been great. I always got the burger and fries and cannot honestly say it was a pretty good burger for the price. We went there for lunch today and were shocked by how much they raised their prices! They charge $17 for their burger!! And $5 for their fries!! $22 for a burger and fries?? Really?? They are good but not that good, we have now taken them off our weekly lunch rotation. Instead we will go to Burntwood in Cuyahoga Falls. The food is just as good if not better and half the price!  Come on ORD, I know you are in Hudson, but that doesn't mean you have to gouge people trying to have a decent lunch."}
{"text":"We shared a number of very well presented, tasty small plates and dessert. The highlight of the night was the outstanding service by Jessie. We closed the place around midnight and the rest of the staff, especially the manager, were very gracious. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their weekend brunch, I can't really speak to other times. My lobster brie omelette with wild mushrooms was delish!"}
{"text":"I knew they had great lunch and dinner, but I recently found out they also have a great brunch.  The food is top notch, and the ingredients are fresh.  I had eggs benedict, with a side of chicken turkey sausage.  The portion was generous, and the prices were reasonable.  I'll be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Village ambiance is inviting, neighbors chat in this place. The service is quite good and attentive. The food is above average and amply portioned."}
{"text":"Our second visit to One Red Door proved that this is by far one of the finest restaurants in the area. While the experience wasn't quite as flawless as our first visit -- in which everything we put into our mouths was absolutely fantastic -- it was enormously satisfying, and well worth the (surprisingly reasonable) price.  We started out with glasses from the extensive wine list. Not being familiar with any of the vintners featured (a good thing, in my estimation), we embarked on a self-guided evening of tasting. The wines went from interesting-but-not-great (a Grenache-Carignane that was one of the cheapest glasses on the menu at $8) to really excellent (the $12 Cain Cuvee). The list features wines at an wide range of price points, with a handful in the $30 range.   Dinner began with a selection of \"bites\" -- basically, ORD's version of tapas. Warm olives were surprisingly flavorful in a wine sauce, and the bacon-wrapped, cheese-stuffed dates were excellent. (Pricey at $3.50 apiece, and not quite as good as our previous visit, but still outstanding.) The real standout from the bites was the fried manchego cheese with a honey glaze: we could have eaten this all night and not regretted missing anything else.  The bites, however, were where the dinner's one big misstep appeared: grilled shishito peppers ranged from a pleasant heat to a mouth-searing scorch. We caught on quickly and made sure to scrape the seeds out of the peppers, but even so the heat was simply too overpowering for anything else we tried on the menu.  For an entree, we split an item from the \"small plates\" section: a pumpkin risotto with baby onions, pork shank, and bacon. In a word: perfect. The risotto was perfectly al dente, the sauce was creamy without being overpowering, and both meats were cooked expertly, conveying pure pork essence without overpowering the delicate pumpkin flavor.  Dessert was an orange-chocolate cheesecake, which was quite good though both a bit heavy and a bit overly orangey to my tastes.   Service throughout the night was exceptional, attentive without being the slightest bit intrusive (something I'm very sensitive to). Our server even brought dessert on a plate with \"Happy Anniversary\" spelled out in chocolate sauce. (I had mentioned that it was our anniversary when making reservations through OpenTable.)   We left full and happy, leaving a bill behind that was about 75 percent the size we were expecting given the quality of the food and wine.  One caveat, though, for anyone else looking to share a special occasion here. As I'd requested in the reservation, we were initially seated at the one private booth in the back of the restaurant. This seems like a lovely little hideaway, a private room with glimpses of the open kitchen from one seat and a view down the restaurant from the other (assuming you don't close the gauzy curtains).   Unfortunately, we asked to be moved almost immediately due to two serious flaws in the table's location. First, a blazingly bright fluorescent light in the kitchen is situated in exactly the worst place for the diner facing the kitchen, destroying any sense of ambience and intimacy. And second, the kitchen door is right next to the booth, which means that not only is there the most constant stream of servers to be found anywhere in the restaurant, but the entire booth thumps and shakes every single time that (apparently quite heavy) door closes.   If the management would replace the door with something not quite as heavy (or put it on a hydraulic or something) that would help considerably. And that fluorescent light has got to go. Until these are rectified, I'd recommend anyone looking for intimacy request the table around the corner from the entrance. It looked like the most private space in the restaurant, by far."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of talk about this restaurant, so had to check it out for myself. Ended up getting the chargrilled hanger steak with braised oxtail ravioli and was not impressed. For the price of the meal you really don't get much food, and though the steak was cooked well it was not as hot as I hoped."}
{"text":"I haven't been to One Red Door in years ... literally years. Every time I used to go, I would leave feeling sick (and not because I ate too much). So I was a little hesitant to go back, but I thought that I would give it another shot. So I went for a different meal than just dinner ... I went for brunch. I made a reservation on Opentable, but there wasn't really anyone there when we got there (I still love the Opentable points though). The brunch menu had a lot of variety, and I ended up getting the chicken and waffles, and a side of hashbrowns (which were really potatoes). The food was amazing. Way too much though. I also liked that the chicken did not have any bones in it. It one of my pet peeves when I order chicken and waffles, and the chicken has bones in it. How am I supposed to eat it with syrup all over it if it has bones in it? Anyway, I highly recommend for brunch. It was a great experience, and it turned my opinion around about the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great choice for brunch. The brunch menu had me drooling and everything we ordered was delicious. The side of grits is a huge portion and some of the best I have ever had. Their breakfast potatoes are outstanding, finally a breakfast potato that is cooked crispy. The only downfall here is that beers are expensive. Most drafts are $6-$8 and the mimosas are $8."}
{"text":"Came in for saturday brunch with a party of 6 and overall it was a good experience. All of the food we had was quite good from the chicken bahn mi to the burger and the cobb salad. Server was very nice and accommodating and was timely. Girls at the front desk not so much. We didnt want to squeeze 6 people into a 4 top table and they were very reluctant to put 2 tables togther while the restaurant was not very full. Still would return again."}
{"text":"We discovered an excellent happy hour here. Most apps are half off and the burger and pizza are 6 and 5 respectively. Good price & good food. We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to One Red Door for both lunch and dinner and wasn't impressed. I thought the food was way overpriced and flavorless. I also wasn't a fun of the mushroom flavored bread my waitress brought out at dinner. While the atmosphere here is nice, I don't think it's worth the money."}
{"text":"Go between 3-6 for half price small bites and the best $6 burger you ever had. Ahi tacos are killer as are the chorizo dates. Mac and cheese with BBQ pork is great but it is not on the summer menu. The burger is great as long as you use the house made applewood bacon date aioli on it."}
{"text":"Went with the wife and daughter for saturday brunch. Restaurant was pretty much empty. We were seated very promptly. We ordered our drinks and it seemed like about ten to fifteen minutes before we saw the waiter to take our order. I went over to the bar where they had some pickles for the bloody marry bar sitting out amongst the olives. I put 3 slices on a small plate for my daughter and the bartender told me they were exclusively for the bloody marry bar. He was sort of short and rude, I took them anyway. Our food finally arrived I had the corned beef hash with sunny side up eggs and hash browns. The corned beef was dry and charred it was crunchy. The eggs were way over done not runny at all and very brown on bottom. The sausage patty my wife had was bone dry and over done as well. The hash browns were cold and felt like they had been sitting around for awhile. The only thing that was good was the pancakes my wife had. We ordered bacon on the side for us to all split and it was charred beyond recognition. To top it all off when they brought the high chair for our daughter it was full of crumbs and ketchup stains. I went to the restroom and the mens room was filthy the toilet looked as bad as a truck stop. Too bad I was on my way out when I went or I would have left before I ordered. I think this place was like a trap it looked nice on the inside and the menu looked promising but only brought disappointment.  This place is a joke, I have had way better at Cracker Barrel or Waffle House. What a shit hole."}
{"text":"Very very good...had the burger...cooked perfectly excellent...frites nice and crispy asked for the garlic aioli and it was a nice touch...appertizer was a cheese like fondueish that was surprisingly good...old fashioned so were well crafted and the creme broiler was excellent...highly reccomend...will stop back on the way home...bravo!"}
{"text":"My wife and recently had lunch at the One Red Door. This restaurant  has a lot of potential but the service disappointed us. The staff acted put out by having to serve us.  Food is just ok and probably seemed less desirable due to the poor service.   We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love  this place! Everything was great. We reserved the booth by the kitchen which is kind of enclosed and private. It wasn't loud like the rest of the restaurant. The decor is amazing! We ordered the yellowtail sashimi with the jalapeno and olive oil. It was delicious. We also had the calamari as an appetizer. The calamari was perfectly cooked and the sauce it is served with is delicious. For dinner I ordered the grouper with gnocci and spinach. The fish was perfectly cooked and sat on a bed of sauteed spinach in a lobster jus. My husband had the short ribs, his dish was excellent. For dessert we shared a chocolate tort with caramel sauce and fresh whipped cream. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't care for my martini. I ordered a Washington Apple martini and it was made with Apple cider and something else that tasted like vanilla. Definitely not what I was expecting. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Super yum tactic, great different dishes than most other places, a little pricey so come not so hungry with tapas as your main course. Very trendy, price location hot 1st and main next to library... Awesome to impress a date!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times now.  We are mostly vegan now but go vegetarian here as their flatbreads are DELICIOUS!  I love the goat cheese and greens one and of course the margherita one.  I also adore the pea and mint crostinis and my husband likes the peppers.   The tuna tacos were also superb.  We took a guest there recently and he raved over his chicken.  The bloody mary's are always perfectly spicy and the creme brulee is one of the best.  Every dessert we've tried has been fantastic.    Our service is almost always great and the atmosphere is freaking awesome.    They also have a patio.    This is a great place for a romantic date, they also have a kind of private booth near the kitchen.  The whole place has fabulous low lighting and there is shopping all around it.  We are so very happy we found it!  Oh and be careful in heels on their floor, it can be a bit slick."}
{"text":"We've dined here a good half dozen times since it's opened. About half the time we love it, and the other times... they just miss. Service is usually good, food was also very good to meh.  The mushroom flatbread was really good the first time we had it, but then another time it was crusted with an excessive amount of charred flour. Lots of choices with small plates, flatbreads and entrees."}
{"text":"No!  This restaurant seems to be trying way too hard to be fancy. The food was good but too small of portions and it was trying too hard to be fancy for the sake of being fancy."}
{"text":"Still a fan- went there for apps and wine the other night.  The bartender from Flemings works there now.  Anthony.  He's pretty good- check it out when you get a minute."}
{"text":"Plan on not eating much and paying too much for this place.  $17 for a burger that tastes/looks like a Wendy's burger, I think not.  Oober salty, very expensive, slow service."}
{"text":"Was here for a large group dinner on a Friday evening. Would definitely suggest reservations as this place is hopping - we were seated right away and had a server who was on top of her game. I had some pinot grigio to accompany my meal. I started with a roasted date (heavier on the stuffing than on the date, but good) and the roasted nuts (really delicious and strong flavor...good mixture of choices). I then had the pizza with pepperoni on top. It was a good upscale bar pizza - filling with a decent flavor balance. I liked the vibe at this place - trendy, yet comfortable. Definitely a place I would \"hang\" if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Our table had the steak frites, Ohio lamb bolognese and the boar pizza and they were all excellent. Flip Side is connected to the restaurant and you can also order from their beer list as well. We made a reservation on Open Table. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Kind of forget about this place but have never had a bad meal.   I think the lighting is too dark so we feel it has this \"special occasion\" vibe to it.  So if its a special occasion i give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Visited here with a group for dinner. We had a reservation & were seated right away. The meal started a little awkward as we had 3 different servers stop by& ask us for drink orders within 3 minutes of sitting down. However service after that was great! I got the salty dog drink & it was very good! We ordered calamari & the ahi tuna appetizers. The calamari was fried well but incredibly spicy as there were also peppers fried with the rings. They also served the sauce on it, rather than on the side. The tuna was fine- pretty standard dish. For entrees, we had walleye, scallops, strip steak & the burger. Everyone loved their dishes! My scallops were cooked well & huge! The other dish accompaniments were good, but I didn't love the sauce. My husband said the scallops were the best he's ever had & they were quite good!  Overall, a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. The rotating menu does make it difficult to say what my favorite dish is - but honestly, they've all been very good. With these seasonal dishes, you can expect fresh food each time. Tonight, my husband and I ordered a tasty Lavender Row Rose wine, a cheese plate (with blue cheese, feta, and prosciutto) for starters, a lobster roll, and bouillabaisse.    The cheese plate was phenomenal; I especially loved the fig jam and toasted almonds that came with the cheese plate.  The blue cheese just melts in your mouth!  The cheese plate also contained grapes, toasted bread, crackers and mustard - it was the perfect taste combination. The lobster roll was one of the most delicious ones I've had, since the cream-base was light and tasty, and the lobster pieces were huge and juicy.  It also came with a side cup of lobster broth, which I don't have any words for other than YUM.  My bouillabaisse was delicious - with a lot of seafood and a light broth (not swimming in too much butter and fat).    This was a wonderful dinner all around and worth the price for a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"They have good food, not great. We tried a little bit of everything, and we're not overly impressed. Their prices are pretty steep for fairly small portions. This atmosphere and decor are nice though. I just think you get a better value and experience at Rosewood.   They are attached to and own Flipside, which is great and always packed. They should have made this restaurant smaller and Flipside bigger."}
{"text":"We had been to one red door twice before, both times of which were in the winter. We went this time on a Friday night in the summer when the weather was nice and sat outside on the patio. We got the charcuterie and cheese board with sopressata, prosciutto, black pepper feta, smoked gouda, and the blue cheese. We also split the grouper fish sandwich. My husband had a McKenzies pumpkin hard cider and I had a French martini. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service was a little slow. Otherwise, the food was outstanding and the drinks were excellent. I finished the meal off with a cappuccino which is one of the better cappuccinos I have had. I really enjoyed the meal and sitting on the patio with the perfect weather was a nice bonus."}
{"text":"I had a very nice dinning experience last week !! The atmosphere is very classy and the service is excellent. The wines and the food selections were excellent !! A special thanks to Nicole and Eric for making the evening very enjoyable for me and my guest !!  Thx DR MD"}
{"text":"Food is 5 stars!   Eric is doing a great job!   Hire someone to train your staff.....I expect better.  And  brunch.   Those breakfast potatoes are terrible, let the chefs  come up with something better.  Frozen hash browns are better.      Love ORD!   But really.....up your game.  Oh I almost forgot.  Hostesses.   Train some decent ones.  I should walk in a get Greeted.   Welcome to  one Red Door.  It's a beautiful night, would you care to sit outside.  Do you have a reservation?   I want to check them for a pulse and would have fired them in the spot the last time that I was in."}
{"text":"Great place to go with a group of friends. Cool vibe, great drink menu, friendly staff. Food was average (a hot lobster roll??) and, perhaps, a bit overpriced. Hadn't been to downtown Hudson in years, and loved the overall feel."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my fiancée and his mom because we were considering having our wedding rehearsal dinner here. I absolutely adored the ambiance of the place, kind of rustic but also modern with hints of Italian decor.   We all 3 ordered different items coincidentally, but it allowed us to get a good feel for their food quality and range. I had the mushroom flatbread pizza, which was seasoned excellently and finished with a nice, crisp crust. I took half home because it was a nice size. My fiancée ordered rotisserie chicken and chorizo tacos, which was from their brunch menu. It came with 3 tortillas plus a heaping pile of fried potatoes with two over easy eggs on top. He cleaned his plate, though it took some effort. His mom got the grouper sandwich, she was in between that and the salmon salad and the waitress recommended the grouper. It looked really yummy, seared golden brown and served with some sort of aioli. She also ate it all and it came with a nice salad on the side of the plate. We all enjoyed our food and the atmosphere, so we're looking forward to doing our rehearsal dinner here come September!"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. I've begun to make a habit of dining here at least once every time I visit Hudson. The food never disappoints, and the staff seem to really enjoy serving customers and making recommendations.   We arrived quite early, at happy hour, and the bar was completely full.  They set us up in a generously-sized booth.  We had two servers and they were incredibly friendly, full of good suggestions.   The burger here is delicious.  I always enjoy the warm spinach salad with it's yummy zesty dressing and mouthwatering crumble of thick cut crisp bacon.  Mmmm, getting an appetite just writing this.   The place has a cosy upscale vibe. It's nice without being pretentious. You would be comfortable here coming straight from work in your business attire, or wearing jeans and a hoodie.  It's all good.   If you are in Hudson, make sure you dine here at least once.  It's the best restaurant in Hudson."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance here! Went with a friend for a later dinner and with each course it kept getting better and better. For starters, they have some amazing and crafty cocktails, I love the salty dog (one of my all time favor time drinks) and the German chocolate cake was delicious.  For appetizers we had the deviled eggs (amazing) and a cheese board which is served with some wonderful accompaniments (chutney, almonds, apples). The kale salad has shaved cauliflower which gives it a unique twist.  For the main course, I choose the braised short rib which was unbelievable, ultra tender and served with a wonderful vegetable hash.  Service was excellent, unobtrusive yet met all of our needs and he had a great personality. Definitely a first choice when I am in hudson next time!"}
{"text":"Met with some friends here after work for drinks. We had a table of four with a wonderful server. We enjoyed the atmosphere. They had Stella on tap. No complaints here. Food came in a timely manner. Perfect place for a date, dinner with the family, drinks with your friends."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate our birthdays. 3 out of 4 people had birthdays. So we had the right mind set for good food and a fun time.  The best part of this experience was the company.  We ordered and each got one piece of bread with some compound butter. We were never asked if we wanted more.  The entree's came and I had ordered the scallops I was very disappointed for $32 I expected a little more food or even more bread.  I received 3 scallops and two small bok choy in a citrus lemongrass broth that was so bitter. Everyone at my table agreed. There was nothing else no starch to fill me up.  The dessert menu was uninspired and when I got home I had to cook dinner because 3 scallops and 5 bites of vegetables with 1 slice of bread does not make a meal especially for $32.   I contacted the restaurant and they didn't say a word. I figured maybe they would have explained their actions but they didn't had the waitress asked I would have told her but the service was not very good. I understand everyone has bad days and I gave them a chance to tell me anything to change my mind. Which I think is ridiculous, because they could have changed my opinion of them. They chose not to. So I will make a point to tell people just how bad it was.  I wouldn't go back on a bet if someone else paid"}
{"text":"Went there with another couple on Saturday night for a birthday. I would say it's about average experience,  nothing extremely memorable. Sat outside for a bit but it was too windy so move inside for our main course. We had kale salad, Ahi Tuna admnd Lobster roll, our friends had mushroom pizza, hummus platter and a salad. Everything was ok, kind of average. When I informed that we had a birthday person in our party, they asked me to choose a dessert (and I asked for a candle to be put on it), but then we got charged for it - that's somewhat disappointing. Usually, desserts are no charge for a birthday person - not the biggest of a deal, but I would change that if I was a restaurant. Don't think i would recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm a bit confused. It's next door to a \"sister\" restaurant, but I have no idea if they share a kitchen?? Not to worry as the service is good and the food as well. The space is very open and has a \"warehouse\" feel to it. The menu consists of a lot of small plate options and some more traditional burger, fish, chicken options. They also have outdoor seating and I would highly recommend their \"Happy Hour\" as they have some really well priced options and a generous time period (4-6) I seem to remember, but check on their website as this could have changed."}
{"text":"We enjoyed dinner at One Red Door last evening, and it was an incomparable meal. We arrived and my boyfriend was greeted by the hostess with a \"Happy Birthday\". We were immediately seated in a secluded booth that was perfectly intimate and perfect for conversation and enjoying the meal ahead. Our server Nicole was professional, knowledgeable and so pleasant.  We enjoyed a charcuterie of 3 selections that was a meal in Itself. Instead of selections from the extensive winelist we opted for beer ( National Beer Day). The beer selections for draft and craft brews were good. The roasted beet salad  was fresh and large enough for us to share. The evening special was an almond crusted snapper with red skinned potatoes and a kalamata tapenade. It was a huge serving and delicious! Very Hot! My boyfriend enjoyed the lamb Bolognese. We shared a delicious creme brulee for dessert. It was presented with a Birthday Candle on top,  so special!  The top of the creme brulee was perfectly crisped and thin. The creme was a velvety consistency and not overpoweringly sweet. Perfect! Espresso was served with a twist of orange rind garnish. Excellent. This was a perfect meal from start to finish thanks to the team at One Red Door. They knocked this one right out of the park!!!!"}
{"text":"One Red Door has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants. I was already a huge fan of Downtown 140 (the chef's previous restaurant) so when I heard he was starting a new place I was excited to try. Since they've opened I've been here multiple times and everything I've had has been wonderful. Great service, great atmosphere, great food, I really don't have one bad thing to say. The prices are even reasonable for the level of quality you get. Go here for a date or go here with a group of friends, you won't be disappointed. Recently, I screwed up and made reservations for the wrong night and they still accommodated me even though they had a full-house. Top notch."}
{"text":"Good foodie place. Food is unique and good. Snacks are tiny portions but scrumptious like the shisito peppers and ahi taco. You can order a Cheese boardman and charcuterie Board with a great wine selection. Entrees are pretty but the restaurant is super dark and service is snobby and yet too laxed."}
{"text":"ORD has the best cocktails in Hudson - by far. The interior is beautiful and rustic with exposed brick and cross beams. The food is unique and everything tastes great. I'd recommend brunch most of all - especially the rotisserie chicken and chorizo tacos.   There is also a really nice patio with plant boxes full of fresh herbs. It's typically shaded from the sun, too."}
{"text":"Probably the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. We were so excited to drive to Hudson and check out the area, and this restaurant seemed to have an amazing rating. We sat outside and ordered. Our charcuterie plate was great, but that's the only positive. First off, our silver ware was SO DIRTY. The fork was covered in a ranch dressing and the knife had all this oil on it. We got our food, yet our waitress was nowhere to be found. Our salads (I got the appetizer kale salad with chicken and my boyfriend got the entree steak) were the exact same size. One hand full of lettuce each. Mine had one small strawberry and cauliflower cut up (literally 4 small quarters, and small fragments of vegetable) and no chicken. It took another 10 minutes to find our server, and another 20 to get chicken. The waitress said she would take my salad off the bill because of the issue, however by the end of the meal, there is was on the check. My boyfriend had also been waiting about 45 minutes to get a drink refill, and finally got it at the very end of the meal which really defeated the purpose. I have worked in restaurants and I completely understand that sometimes there are issues, but it wasn't very busy and there's no excuse for telling someone they are taking an item off the bill and not following through. Never coming back."}
{"text":"One very expensive Red Door for what you get.  Very pricey for little flavor.  The Black Grouper was virtually tasteless and so was the price at $27 ala carte.  Salt? pepper?  Pretty basic stuff.  Came with a crab sauce ... tasteless.  Really expected way more from all the buzz. The Chicken on the other hand (1/4 piece ??) was very tasty but there was so little it was a joke.  Service, however, was excellent and the patio is nice.  $20 for Lagavulin and a not so generous pour at that ... absurd and not worth going back.  Not sure what people see as the attraction, but have at it ... just take your bank account and don't go there is you are hungry."}
{"text":"I went here for a lunch after shopping with my mom. We had the stuffed date for an appetizer and because there was only one per order we got two. Although it was definitely pricier for a date ($4 per date) they were warm with a nice spicy chorizo inside and served over a warm tomato sauce. I ended up getting the lobster roll which was pretty good for a lobster roll in Cleveland. The bun was perfectly crispy and the sauce on the lobster wasn't overwhelming. The salad that was served with it was quite large which I didn't end up finishing, but the dressing with the salad was delicious. Would definitely go back and try again."}
{"text":"Came with a large group of colleagues.  We had a huge array of appetizers; charcuterie and cheese, spring rolls, deviled eggs, fried calamari, clams casino and shishito pepper. All we excellent with the deviled eggs being the biggest hit.  I opted for a arugala salad and black bean soup for dinner. The salad was huge and came with a warm bacon dressing, cripsy lardons and a touch of cheese.  The soup was very good with a bit of cilantro creme fraiche and a wonderful somky flavor.  The drink list was extensive but I opted for a Hitachino White Ale which is always a great choice.  Service was very good and there were no issues."}
{"text":"We love to have brunch here.  They are kid friendly although there is not technically a kid's menu so it can get kind of pricey for children. It's one of our favorite places for date night and we love the seasonal menu options.  Lemon ricotta pancakes and chicken and waffles are so good at brunch!! Dinner Favorites are shrimp and grits, beet salad, chorizo date appetizer !"}
{"text":"Second time at One Red Door and I'm even more in love! My boyfriend and I went for our Valentines Day dinner and were so impressed. The food seemed even better than before (we loved our first trip here in November), so that's saying something. Being that I was visiting from NYC I always find it hard to find food in Ohio that compares to the variety and quality of trendy cuisine we have in the city. One Red Door has just that! Their chef does an excellent job incorporating trendy foods and preparation while still holding on to some of that \"home grown\" Ohio pride, by using Ohio raised meats and other ingredients.   This time around, we had the pork belly as an appetizer, it was amazing! For dinner, I had the Arctic Char dish, which was cooked to perfection and left me feeling completely satisfied. My boyfriend ordered the Filet special, which included a delicious steak with mushrooms and other fabulous accompaniments. For dessert we split the chocolate tart with raspberry compote, a delicious, holiday theme fitting dessert. I had a glass of the 2010 Malbec and my boyfriend had their apple bourbon drink. We loved every part of our meal, including the wonderful waitress we had. Service is always great and we will most definitely be returning.   While the price point is a bit higher for some places in Ohio it is worth every penny and is truly setting a high standard for quality cuisine in Ohio!  We cant seem to understand the dress though, due to the trendy atmosphere and quality of food, we tend to dress a little nicer when eating here. However, a lot of the guests around us are always dressed semi casually in jeans and jackets. While puzzling us, it doesn't deter us at all from this great restaurant.  We recommend the One Red Door to everyone we know!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Late for bowling and husband hunts at this time of year.  He wants MEAT!  Our route takes us through Hudson so we decide to try Flipside - we have an hour to eat before lobbing 14+ pound balls down (overly) oiled lanes for 2 hours.  When hubby drops me off at 1st and Main to find a parking space, and a woman runs by me dragging her elderly mother in tow trying to beat me to the door, I realize there must be a line for Flipside.  Yikes!  There are people in line, people at the bar, and people congregating around the tables in Flipside.  I (knowing that One Red Door shares a kitchen/bar with Flipside) choose One Red Door for dinner.  The hostess assures me that they can get us in and out in 45 minutes (which they do!)  I have dined at One Red Door a few times but my husband has never eaten there.  We ordered the Truffled Deviled Eggs and Chicken Wings for appetizers.  Ray had a draft seasonal beer and I had a red blend wine which were excellent!  The waitstaff was attentive and helpful!  The restaurant was dark and romantic and perfect for us!  We were seated at a bar that was open to the kitchen.  We watched a chef dressed in a Flipside coat make food for the people waiting in line next door.  Why would you wait in line to save a few dollars??  We ordered hamburgers (with brie and fried scallions) for dinner... they were OUTRAGEOUSLY delicious!  We talked with the chefs while they were cooking - it was so much fun!  We were literally in and out of there in 45 minutes!    We were SO pleased with the staff and our \"red carpet\" treatment that we can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Always have a good meal here, but also always have some issue with service...typically unbelievably slow. This past Sunday, we went for brunch at 1:00pm. It was not busy...which is unfortunate, given that it was brunch time. We were seated and waited...for 15 minutes...before we got up and asked if we had a server. The host seemed shocked that no one had come to the table. When the server arrived at the table finally, she noted that there recently had been a station change, so there was some lack of clarity on who was our server. She was a great server and the food was fantastic, as usual,  it this is the third time something like this has happened. Please get it together, One Red Door...lets we have to find another brunch spot! :)"}
{"text":"$17 burger is worth it. Love the homemade ketchup and some interesting wines by the glass."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening to hang out with some friends and had a great time.  Atmosphere was nice, architecture was pleasant and it wasn't too loud to have a decent conversation.  Amaretto sour was really good and my dining partner's seemed to really enjoy the beer and wine offerings on the menu.  A lot of things on the menu peaked our interest so we opted to get a few \"small bites\" and a pizza to share.  Ahi Tuna Tartar Taco - meh, there was supposed to be wasabi in this dish somewhere but it just wound up being a little bland and messy.  Crispy Duck Confit Nuggets with curry aioli - best thing we ate outside of dessert, the curry aioli was really nice, but I couldn't distinguish a very \"ducky\" taste, they could have been chicken nuggets for all I knew!  Lake Erie Creamery Goat Cheese cake - this was quite nice as well, but a little too small even for a \"small bite\", very difficult to share but the flavors were all in the right place.  Crab Cake - not bad, mustard aioli (they like using that stuff a lot here) was good, but the crab cake was kind of \"fishy\" tasting, not sure if they used the canned variety or fresh, but it was lacking a little bit.  The crust was nice on it though, well cooked.  Lobster crust - basically a thin-crust pizza with cheese on it and one lobster chunk per slice.....there was supposed to be leek and spinach in this thing too but I didn't catch one glimpse of any green.  It was ok, definitely nothing to write home about.  We packaged up the two slices left over and were going to take it home but it started smelling up the car so we just chucked it out after driving for a couple of miles.  Dessert - got some kind of peanut-chocolate thingy that was really good, but you can't really mess up that flavor combination even if you try  ;o)  The questionables:  1.  Service was good, perhaps a little \"too\" good.  Our friends were still working on their fries near the end of the meal and we literally had about 5 separate people come over and try and snatch the plate out from under them, hands off people!  There are easy signs to watch for to let you know when people are done eating, learn them!!  2.  The menu with their \"bites\", \"small plates\" and \"feasts\" seems awfully similar to the Greenhouse Tavern's \"firsts\", \"seconds\" and \"thirds\"......it seems like they tried ripping off the menu concept, but they didn't really succeed with the execution.  I might come back and try their burgers as our friends (who both got the burger) really enjoyed their meals and the couple fries I scooped off their plate were pretty tasty.  The cheese board that a couple of ladies at the bar ordered also looked really nice.  So, deserving of a second chance, but I'll definitely be less adventurous in what I order next time."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, if any at all!!  Took my Mom for Mother's Day brunch. Decent crowd but not packed.  Meals came out after about 30 minutes, but, her's was not the correct order. Server didn't even apologize and said he will get correct order \"right away\". 10 minutes went by before waiter came to say he \"hit the wrong button\". The mistake is understandable,  waiting 25 minutes for an egg, 2 pancakes and 2 pieces of bacon is not! While many other plates came out of the kitchen.  Now the unacceptable part. Manager (blonde haired lady) walked by a few times like nothing was wrong, as my food sat and got cold waiting for Mom's plate to come out. When we finally flagged her down, she said she would get the food out asap. It took at least 10 more minutes!! When asked why the waiter never returned, even to refill coffee,  she said, \" I repremanded him, so he is not in a good mood\". WHAT??! So our service suffers because he got coached? Manager never came back to follow up with us either. Food was mediocre too, but, service and management are pathetic. Not recommended. Had to give one star to get this posted, but, they deserve zero stars."}
{"text":"I LOVE the atmosphere at this place, although it's a bit loud. I wouldn't be able to take my older in-laws here. The food is fabulous. It's a great place to share small plates with friends. The mac'n'cheese with brisket is to die for! I'm crazy about the bacon wrapped date. The scallops are excellent, too. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town and my new go to for Sunday brunch. Have been here multiple times and the service is always excellent."}
{"text":"This used to be one of the best places in town, but it seems like it has gone downhill.  We stopped in at the bar last night for a drink and appetizer and had a lousy experience.  To start off, I received the wrong draft beer and the bartender was very rude about replacing it.  Then our calamari app appeared to be the scraps from the bottom of a frozen bag.  There's lots of options in Hudson, so it will be a long time before we try ORD again."}
{"text":"Wow! They have a seasonal menu and they just switched to their summer one. Lots of options and everything looks too good to choose from! Summer salad, steak and frites, summer pizza... everything was amazing! The service is great too. They also have a patio that allows dogs and a great happy hour mon-thurs between 3-6pm in the bar or on the patio. Same owners as flipside burgers and 3 palms pizzeria."}
{"text":"Just had the best meal in a long time!! Chef Monday keep doing what you do. No lie I ordered every \"bite\" off the menu no complaints. Absolutely fantastic!! Strip steak cooked to perfection!! Desserts amazing! Completely satisfied!!"}
{"text":"Over priced for it's cusine and very slow service ! We tried them three times, we walked out the third time unbelievable.   Three palms and Flip Side owned by same Group ! ! Three Plans across the Street offers a different type of Italian cusine but, pricey !:Don't order Pasta of the Day, it is always, BLAND !!!!!  Tom Dean Hudson, Ohio"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a great atmosphere and the food is good.   However, we sat in the bar area and had poor service, I think the bartender was overwhelmed.  Next time we will sit on the restaurant side."}
{"text":"The menu has a lot to choose from. They do try with the quality of the food. My beet salad was very tasty except for the beets. I have never experienced that before. I would have added salt but that probably would not have helped. My friends lobster roll was good. Not great. I ordered their truffle deviled eggs. Not Good. The flavor was a strong Dill pickle juice and a hint of capers. No and I mean no truffle oil or truffles at all. The Salmon was very good and my niece ordered a veggie burger and she liked it. My nephew ordered a pizza and liked it. I tasted the lamb bolognese with fresh pasta and it was good. It's a good place to go but don't expect to much."}
{"text":"Now that Downtown 140 has shifted its menu into more ordinary territory, One Red Door is my favorite \"special occasion\" restaurant in Hudson.  Part of chef Shawn Monday's empire, there are familiar favorites from the days when he was the executive chef at Downtown 140 (most notably and awesomely, the ahi tuna taco).    The menu is organized by \"Snacks\" (small-to-medium-sized appetizers), \"Small plates\" (healthy-sized appetizers), and \"Large plates\" (standard entrees), with some pizzas, vegetables, and a burger tossed in for good measure.  Portion-wise, I've found that two \"snacks\" and a \"small\" plate satisfies my relatively average appetite, but a \"snack\" or a \"small\" plus a \"large\" item won't be overwhelming.    I always enjoy my meals here, and in addition to the aforementioned tuna taco, I've devoured with pleasure the chicken spring roll (snack), the clams (small), the crab cakes (snack), several of the fish entrees (some of which have been featured specials), and the deviled eggs (snack).  Really, the only menu item I've ever had that hasn't wowed me is the kale and cauliflower salad, which needs a slightly tangier or spicier dressing to enliven the veggies.    They now offer an entree for vegans (rare around these parts), but I can't speak to it personally.  Prices are good for this type of upscale experience; my Dad mentioned that his New York strip, which was a sizable cut and included potatoes and grilled romaine, was a virtual steal at $33.  They have a nice list of good beers and about 12 (each) white and red wines by the glass.  Full bar as well.   The atmosphere is stylish and sleek, and the service was spotty at first, but is getting better. Not a complaint at all the last two times I've been.  Reservations available via OpenTable."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance, attentive wait staff.  Burgers were delish!  I prefer my pommes frites to be crispy, light; mine were limp and heavy.  Wine was exceptional."}
{"text":"I went for Brunch. I ordered the lemon ricotta pancake.. was yummy! Love Hudson overall, this is right in the middle of the main street shopping area and is a charming place to stop by."}
{"text":"WAlked in on the night before Thanksgiving with a party of 8. They quickly put tables together and worked it out great.  Good Bibb salad, flat bread pizzas. Wonderful date appetizer, literally a date. Nice complimentary bread.  Beer selection on draft was limited, which was surprising given the vibe of the place. Food was fine, we order a couple of entrees (scallops) that were pricy but good. Total tab including tip for 8 was $200, which was fair ."}
{"text":"This is a busy place, packed on a Wed. Located in the legacy village of classy Hudson, Ohio.   I liked the decor.    The server we had was attentive, efficient and personable, and did not hover. Small but serviceable beer list, what ever pilsner I had on draft  was fantastic, I could have had a few more but it was a school night. The house pinot noir was decent, we were never told what it was.  Ordered several small plates. We started with the duck wings with a Korean suace and kimchi(sesame bulgogi would be the best way to describe it).  The wings were tasty but small, and only 3 per order. The sauce was pretty good it tasted  Korean in my opinion. Good blend of savory,salty with a nice tang. The kimchi was serviceable, enough to  induce Kimchi breath.  The calamari and artichoke fry was pretty good, nice ratio of breading.  I like the fact it had tentacles, I mean who does not like tentacles, when talking about calamari. It was not served with any sauce which is rare, but that was OK the capers  and Korean BBQ suace from the wings did suffice. The bacon salad with a fried egg was fantastic. Our server even split the salad. So the egg kind made the dressing not needed. The vinaigrette and honey mustard none the less were very good. Tasted like it was it was made in house. There was sufficient bacon, as you know even the rabbi said you can never have enough bacon ; )  Overall this was a  good dinning experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.  Jesse, our server, was knowledgeable and helpful.  It's a pleasure to have someone advise what menu items would be more to our liking.  The portion of salmon served to one of our party was supplemented when a comment about the minuscule serving was made to our server.  The result was that we left the restaurant with a \"warm and cozy\" feeling about the place and look forward to returning.  The hanger steak was prepared with unusual items, which added to the flavor.  The salad recommended by Jesse was a perfect companion to the entree."}
{"text":"This may be my first ever post.  I have to share our absolute satisfaction with our meal at One Red Door earlier this week for lunch.  The menu is amazing and food tastes even better.  All four us were completely satisfied with meals.  I got the prime rib sandwich.  The appetizers and dessert that we shared were also fantastic.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"The cheese board and small plates are delicious. I can't say much for the entrées as I usually just stop by after work for happy hour drinks. The bartenders are great - You walk in and they already have your regular drink of choice ready for you without even asking!"}
{"text":"We ordered the kid's pizza, lobster roll, and blackened sandwich.  The kids did not like their pizza here and they love all kinds of pizza.  The other food lacked flavor"}
{"text":"The service is friendly but also slow, untrained and generally incompetent. We were there for brunch, and the coffee was flavorless. There was a fruit fly in the cream.  I have told people many times that I was a fan of Chef Monday. I will not be so vocal in the future. Now I feel embarrassed wondering how many people came here on my recommendation.  The food is still good, but the bar is higher now in NEO. Time to step it up A LOT."}
{"text":"Meh. That's really the best way to describe this place. It was a slow night, but I still expect exceptional service.   My friend and I started off with a couple cocktails. I had a fruity vodka cocktail, the Red Door Salty Dog, which had grapefruit and St. Germaine. He had a dry martini. It had neither olives or at least a garnish (I've always seen it with one or the other?!).  We shared a basic appetizer, the shrimp and calamri. I think that this was honestly the best part of the meal. I'm used to Italian calamari in a red sauce, but the herb sauce was really good. It was the perfect amount of flavorful and mild.   For our entrees I had the New York Strip Steak and he had the Ahi Tuna. The steak had a port (red) wine béarnaise sauce, which is something I found a little peculiar. I've only had the traditional white béarnaise. My father always told me that a good steak doesn't need sauce. I went in hesitantly, but I like to try new things. This mysterious red sauce was too much. It was basically globbed on in heaps and the steak sat in a pool of it. The potatoes were taking a bath as well. I've traditionally seen the béarnaise drizzled over the top and maybe some on the bottom. The flavor of the sauce didn't do any justice for the steak. After scraping most of it, I enjoyed the relatively decent steak.   My friend had the Ahi Tuna. I tried it, and I agreed with his sentiments. Bland. It also didn't seem very fresh. The rice it sat upon was absurdly oversalted. The 'long beans' were tasty though.   The service was also not exceptional for how few people were in there. He didn't articulate the menu well and at one point had to seek out answers. My water was never refilled and near the end of the meal I was drinking the melted vodka ice.   I'm all for trendy and hip restaurants that want to revolutionize food. I try to go into modern restaurants with an open mind. I believe that this place might be trying to hard, and should scale back a bit. Too much flavor and razzle dazzle takes away from the food. For a hundred dollar dinner I was underwhelmed. I eat out for dinner 3-5 times a week, and I'm rarely-to-never this disappointed. I brag about Cleveland's restaurant scene. This restaurant made me lose some of my credibility to my friend who isn't from here.   I'll be diplomatic and give the restaurant another chance. Maybe I came on a bad night because the restaurant seems to have a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Like many other Hudson institutions I was pleased with my soup and sandwich lunch, very high quality ohio grown and raised produce, cheese and meat cuts.  My soup and sandwich combo was under 12 dollars, which I feel is very comparable to the prices of other Hudson culinary insituations.  I had great and fresh french onion soup that had great cheese, sweet onions, and crutons.  My Sandwich was a reuben with Ohio corn beef, which was the cornerstone to this quality sandwich with Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing, grilled between slices of rye bread. I would highly recommend having a few meals here."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great atmosphere!  Went here for Sunday brunch and Chef Joel did not disappoint!  My husband is gluten-free and virtually every item on the menu can be made gluten-free...even the fried chicken!  YUMM!  We ordered the gluten-free breakfast pizza, waffles, steak/eggs/hashbrowns and nothing disappointed.  The fruit platter at the beginning of our meal was juicy and fresh!  The bacon sauce on the steak was unique, melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Can't wait to go back!  Definitely worth a drive wherever you are!"}
{"text":"I feel the same way about One Red Door as I do Flour in Moreland Hills. It's good.... for the suburbs. I caught myself saying this a few times during and after the meal. Until I was challenged. Should such a disclaimer be applicable? Shouldn't all restaurants be held to the same standards and expectations?  Yes and no.   It's no secret that the city is the big leagues, while the more forgiving suburbs are the minors. Oftentimes, you'll find similar ventures or chains catering to the average diner in suburbia, while the city is more liberal in taking chances and seeking notable greatness. To most in the culinary world, to succeed in the big city is a sign that you've made it. You see, going to the city is a destination for some and expectations are raised, while staying close to home and eating at the local tavern is meant for satisfying not much more than convenience. With that said, there comes along a few inspiring ventures that try to bring the same expertise and dining experience that some of the better restaurants in Cleveland have to offer... only closer to families in the suburbs.   The menu at One Red Door was what you would expect from a good restaurant, but not one you'd find too often in the 'burbs. Charcuterie plates, cheese boards, small plates and entrées with a good balance of seafood, pasta and meat courses. We opted for a few small plates to share, a pizza and dessert. All decent and if I lived closer, I'm sure I'd be back because there's probably nothing else nearby that is similar, but overall, I wasn't wowed by any one thing. Better than your average local fare? Sure. But it couldn't compete with the Greenhouse Taverns, Lolita's or Crops of the world, even though the vibe of the place seemed to resemble the casually approachable take to good food that the former restaurants have all been noted for.   One thing that bugged me about the service is that it seemed too intrusive. At any good place of dining, it should be known that a server shall not touch a plate until ALL diners at the table are finished. Even though one might be finished before the rest, servers need to keep their pesky mitts away. This unfortunately didn't happen here. Every two seconds there were busboys and various helpers besides our waitress grasping at plates on our table, which became kind of annoying. I realize they were probably just trying to be helpful, but they seemed overaggressive and in return, we felt rushed. Word of advice to the front of the house: Hands off until we're finished! If you want to compete with the big boys like your persona suggests, iron out a few details and you'll be ok."}
{"text":"This place was totally packed when my friend and I arrived and I can see why! The seasonal menu was truly seasonal and they had a nice selection of cocktails to start the evening. I also love a place that offers a dark and stormy right off the bat--and can make it well!   My friend and I decided to go halfsies on everything that evening and the restaurant made it super easy for us to do so. After and assorted meat and cheese board, we had ordered the heirloom tomato salad, which I was a bit concerned would be difficult to split. Not to worry--they brought us both a half serving on individual plates! Our main dishes, a summer vegetable ravioli and a chicken dish, were also brought with side plates and they even brought us a split brownie sundae for dessert.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive, but not overbearing. The outdoor seating was in high demand, but she did not make us feel rushed in any way. She just would bring us water and ask how we were until we were ready to order. Considering I wanted to spend a leisurely meal catching up with a friend, I definitely appreciated that!  I also ordered a burger to go for a family member. $17 for a burger is pretty steep, but she said the burger was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious and the melted brie totally made the sandwich. And that was after it had sat for 15 minutes at the restaurant (I ate the sundae slowly) and survived a half hour drive home! I can't imagine how good it would have been fresh.  Overall, definitely give this place a thumb's up. It's a bit pricy, but I look forward to coming back seasonally and trying new items whenever they change up their menu :)"}
{"text":"This review is for brunch only, &... feh. The service was snooty & unfriendly, not to mention surprisingly slow on a day when there were almost no other diners in the restaurant. We ended up here because FlipSide was too busy, & I was surprised to find that ORD was, well, not. At all. it crowded up a little bit as we ate, but for a reputable Hudson joint, I would've expected busier.   I ordered the chicken & waffles, which were, well, just plain old chicken & waffles - no seasoning, no sauce, no flavor, no nothing, aside from a little powdered sugar & some condiments on the side. It tasted fine, by virtue of both chicken & waffles being delicious, but it was nothing special - & was far more bland & uncreative than I've had in a long time. Want good chicken & waffles? Hit up Crave in Akron.  This place potential - awesome atmosphere, nice decor, a cozy feel - but it didn't quite cut it for me as a brunch spot. The chicken & waffles were fine but not worth a return, although my friend said her burger was delicious & I can testify that her fries were AMAZING.   I'd go back to One Red Door, but probably only if it were, like, the most convenient meeting place & someone else suggested it."}
{"text":"Very good, approaching excellent.  We've been several times, the most recent trip we did a variety of snacks and small plates.  We started with an excellent Charcuterie plate, one of the best in the Cleveland area.  The pork pate was particularly excellent.  The tuna tartar Tacos were excellent, though the two little tacos were little more than two bites.  The  Truffled Deviled Eggs were very good.  The Calamari and Shrimp was excellent, the best of the small plates.  The Lamb Bolognese was very nice, the pickled chiles made it.  I didn't particularly like the Lobster gnocch, but my two companions did.    We each got a dessert and they were way too much for three people and frankly were just OK.  I'd just skip the desserts in the future.  The waitress gave an excellent wine recommendation and was friendly and generally attentive.  The place was busy but not too noisy or crazy.  For three people (who had a total of 5 drinks), it was $160 plus a tip.  A little on the pricey side, and a solid very-good."}
{"text":"Not sure how I ended up in Hudson on a blustery Saturday evening, but...I learned it's kind of difficult to get a dinner reservation at just about any restaurant in Hudson on a Saturday, no matter what the weather is like.  So One Red Door was my dinner location of choice by way of convenience. (although I'd wanted to check it out for awhile)  I started my dining experience off with an Ohio Mule, One Red Door's take on a Moscow Mule.  It was pretty tasty.  I followed that up with a goat cheese salad that was pretty good.  I'd never had a goat cheese salad with grapefruit before, but it worked somehow.  I found the vegetarian options to be a bit limited, so between the pizza and the pasta entree options, I went with the butternut squash ravioli.  And it was excellent.  Lick your plate excellent.  (but it's a swanky place, so I refrained from embarrassing myself or my boyfriend)  Who knew squash + Brussels sprouts leaves + mushrooms = amazingness.  (I hope to recreate this meal at home, I liked it THAT much)    My boyfriend also really liked his grouper entree.  It came with shrimp dumplings that he could have eaten an entire vat of, I think.    The only downside was the pricing.  The food was very good, but it should have been, since most entrees were in the mid $20 range.  I'm not all that price sensitive but if you're planning on eating at One Red Door, be prepared for a hefty tab if you order more than just an entree and a water.  Definitely worth checking out if you're in search of a fancy pants meal in Hudson!"}
{"text":"2/28/18 Mushroom pizza is awesome and so is the chicken gnocchi. Service was very slow."}
{"text":"Meh. Meh service, meh food, Meh to being seated by the draft of the door, meh to the overpriced burger and streak, meh to the overpriced pricses. If I'm ever in the neighborhood again, I'd  probably be smart to just go to Flip Side next door."}
{"text":"Very good food. Service was great! Took a little while for the bill. My husband had a great date night relaxing, sipping wine"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and fantastic food however they constantly change the menu so when you find something you really like, don't expect to ever eat it again. I went there so many times and begged the waitresses to put the lobster and cauliflower dish that I had back in January back on the menu, but they won't even consider it. they seem so pretentious and kind of unfriendly there."}
{"text":"in terms of atmosphere staff and food this is the Mondays best effort in Hudson. the menu varies seasonally, substituting local fresh products in well thought out dishes that don't overreach."}
{"text":"Cool spot. Brunch till 3! The food was really fantastic. I was really tempted to try the burger but it just seemed strange that it was on the pricier side of the menu. The other entrees didn't disappoint however! One of our friends was a bit dismayed to see the crab cake dish only came with one standard size crab cake. Really seemed like there would have been two. Service was just mediocre. Nobody really wanted to be there. They also had the second door in the breezeway propped open when it was in the twenties outside. Got a nice arctic blast every time someone came or went. Regardless, the food and ambiance is nice. Just wished the staff fit the bill."}
{"text":"One Red Door is my go to restaurant when I'm in the area. The menu is fresh, the drinks are top notch, and you can't beat the atmosphere. It's upscale casual, meaning you'll see people in suits and ties to others in nice shorts and shirts.   The food is crafty without being pretentious, such as pan roasted walleye with charred cherry tomatoes. Pizzas come in a wide variety. There are good vegetarian options too.   Overall this is a great little spot, and a definite must try."}
{"text":"Pros:  Beautiful decor.  Very cozy and well designed.  Well stocked bar and great selection of drinks.  Food was very good and unique.  Fast service.  Cons:  Service.  It's that simple.  No matter how good everything else is, you need good service.  You need employees that smile and look like they enjoy their job (even if they don't) and like talking to customers (even if they don't).  I can go to a dive bar for that attitude."}
{"text":"I have dined at ORD a couple times over the last couple months and have been happy with the experiences overall.   I think some of the dinner items may be a little heavy on the price and light on the food.  But the flavors in the dishes has been very good.  A great example of this is the scallops.  I get that fresh scallops are a pricey component to a dish, especially fresh.  There are things you can add to a dish that can make it more filling for $32 instead of more scallops!  Maybe try some rice?  It would be great to soak up the flavorful sauce!    The brunch at ODR was excellent the only time I've tried it.  The homemade jam that came with my toast would've tasted good on anything.  My party had a wide range of the breakfast dishes (corned beef, pancakes, breakfast pizza) and they were all good.    Took a star off for portion size.  I will go back, especially for the homemade jam."}
{"text":"This place was a nice, fancy atmosphere and pretty good food. I had the One Red Door Burger with the date and bacon aioli which was really great."}
{"text":"We stopped in Saturday afternoon for a quick bite after the Hudson Wine Festival. We got there right before the dinner rush and got seats right at the bar. We choose fairly quickly on the summer pizza. It was a flat bread with zucchini, cherry tomatoes, corn, basil and Parmesan and goat cheese. It was absolutely delicious, we devoured it fairly quickly. The only thing we didn't like was the basil on it, but otherwise fantastic. My problem with the whole thing was the lack of options on their beer menu. There were only like 4 draft beers, and although there was a larger can and bottle list there wasn't a huge variety. They were out of the beer that my girlfriend wanted, but I was happy to see one of the beers being highlighted at the wine fest which I really liked. It had been a very long time since I had eaten here, I do remember enjoying the food at that time too, but again I remember the last time we went for drinks having issues with choosing a drink that we wanted. Still will be a place I would be happy to return to and is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Delish!!! I ordered the chic and it was solo tasty!"}
{"text":"Great contemporary twist on American fare in Hudson.  A small group of us visited in early February and everyone left impressed with the wonderful food, great service and a quirky rustic decor.  The array of cocktails coupled by an impressive wine list provided everyone with ample drink options - in particular, my life loved the 'Bad Apple' martini while we shared a spectacular Sancerre.  Their charcuterie board with the pork pate and various cheese is excellent and offers great value with the amount of food provided.  For dinner, their French Onion soup and Maine sea scallops are two of the best dishes I have consumed in the region.  Definitely a must for anyone visiting Hudson."}
{"text":"Wow, we stopped in for lunch on Saturday. Best burger at a restaurant in a long long time.   Atmosphere was really contemporary and upscale. I was wearing a t-shirt and jeans I felt fine at lunch but would have felt underdressed for dinner kinda vibe. Food selection was in the enough of a variety, but not so many choices you get confused range.   I had the burger. Melted Brie cheese with shallots. The burger was tender and actually cooked medium rare the way I ordered it. I find way too often no matter how you order a burger it arrives well done. It was seriously the best burger I have had in a long time. The bacon aioli sauce was a nice touch. I liked that it came on the side so i could choose how much I wanted.   Service was great and the place was really quiet on a saturday afternoon. I will be back."}
{"text":"The small dishes ordered were great but the entrees had some execution issues. The risotto my wife ordered was dry and crunchy. The lobster pasta I ordered was ok but not great. The service was ok but uneven at times."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast! Ordered the eggs Benedict with avocado and tomato and when it came out it was vhopped cherry tomorrow's And guacamole spread. If your going to say avocado please have a slice of avocado on the item, people are expecting fresh avocado and a slice of tomato not ( cherry tomatoes). And I would have thought that the waitress would have taken this off our bill since we didn't it eat it because it was so bad but no guess she thought we just liked to order food and not eat it. Not going back here anymore."}
{"text":"Very expensive. Nice ambiance. Careful attention to every detail. I would go back on a special occasion."}
{"text":"Nice looking place, enjoyed a great skirt steak meal, bartender was friendly, staff was good.  I'd definitely go back when in Hudson."}
{"text":"Not a terrible place to explore, just not the explosion of flavors this picky eater was craving.  I was really disappointed when we got there because the menu provided on this site is not the same menu available, so I had to settle for a cheese tray & cauliflower :( I really didn't like their selection of cheeses & wished they would've spent an equal amount of time making a more... open selection of cheeses instead of spending hours upon page after page of wines.  And my cauliflower was so under cooked it was raw & had to be sent back. But I will admit, our waitress was very friendly.  And the cook explained that they had steamed it that morning & was embarrassed that he even serve it like that...wasn't anyone's fault really (accidents happen). They removed the charge from the bill & immediately re-steamed my food for me- extremely nice about it! So I can't say the food was bad, it just wasn't anything I felt would be worth returning to ( which bums me out, definitely had been wanting to try this place out for years). However, my fiance loved his food (the banh mi) & will probably be returning without me.  Again, the service was excellent. And the atmosphere is beautiful!!!! Wouldn't mind keeping it exactly as is & turning it into my own home, lol. The presentation of food was also beautiful and the environment was clean. So, don't pass this place up, just maybe call ahead & make sure the object of your midday stomach grumbling desire is available first before you make the trip."}
{"text":"My wife and I ended up at One Red Door again on a Saturday night after we needed a quick reservation and dinner before a holiday party.  As I noted in my past review, we've dined there a number of times in the past but have never really found that one dish/one thing that was fantastic.  Our recent dinner seems to have broken the streak.  For the first time, ORD finally had a chief driven, unique, and well composed vegetarian option on the menu which made my wife ecstatic.  She had high hopes and ordered the Chickpea Stew with greens, fall veggies, cauliflower, quinoa, pine nuts, harissa, and greek yogurt.  The dish completely lived up to her expectations.  In fact, it was the first time she had a dish that she was blown away with at ORD.    One of our primary disappointments in the past with ORD is the fact that the menu seems to be very heavy protein driven, with little options for a vegetarian or someone who wants a \"lighter\" option.  The Chickpea Stew totally hit the mark.  I ordered the crispy skin chicken, brussel sprouts, fall squash, fingerling potatoes, bacon and sweet onion chicken jus.  It was equally fantastic.  It was my first time at ORD that I walked away saying: wow, this is a well composed dish, the flavor elements and texture across all the components came together beautifully.   I noticed that Shawn was in the kitchen the evening I dined there.  I wonder if that helped set the higher standard for the food that went out that night.   The waiter mentioned that the menu is changing next week.  Let's hope that they continue with a strong, creative, out of the box vegetarian option(s) as well as elevating their dishes to be beautifully composed.  With this dinner, ORD has jumped up to be a much more viable dinner option than what I would have recommended in the past.  I hope it continues this way."}
{"text":"Ended up here because Flip Side next door had a wait. One Red Door was pretty empty (it was about 7 p.m. on a Thursday).   The food was good - the bread and lemony butter we were served (inexplicably by a uniformed child?) before the meal was really good! I was so happy that my carb-conscious boyfriend let me eat his bread, too.   The interior is beautiful.   I left pretty underwhelmed because I thought it was super expensive for food that is \"good\" or \"pretty good\". My entrée was $21 for two fish tacos... Huh?? The burger is $19??  Also, the service was not what you would expect from a place that is trying to be \"fine dining\".   I guess a pretty good indication of where things go wrong here: There is a line almost literally out the door next door at Flip Side, which serves beer and hamburgers, and there were four or five tables of people at this \"fancy place\" next door.   Next time, we will wait for a table at Flip Side."}
{"text":"Ambiance above everything, but they do a great job with the food too.  Can you believe they have Saturday brunch too?  I mean, I can wait until Sunday to hit the Bloody Mary bar, but why should I?  The brunch menu was diverse, and had some special items.  Eggs Benedict was OK, but probably not the top 10 you've had.  The pastrami hash was smoked in house and one of the best I've had, and it was huge, huge, huge.  Did I mention the Bloody bar??"}
{"text":"One Red Door is located on a charming little corner in \"Downtown\" Hudson.   The happy hour is great - decent, heavy pours of professionally selected wines, half price delicious appetizers, and very friendly bartenders.  If you ever find yourself in Hudson, stop by for a drink or 4."}
{"text":"This place has been on my to try list for years. I'm excited I finally got to give it a go; and I was not disappointed.   When we showed up around 10p on a Friday the patio was empty, the lights were off, etc.... Since we had a dog though we had to sit out there so went in to ask if it would be okay. They happily sat us outside, changed the propane tank in the nearby heater to provide some warmth, and even volunteered to bring the dog a water bowl.   The Truffled Deviled Eggs ($6) were a good choice from the snack menu. They came with three egg halves and a slice of crispy prosciutto in each one (+$1).   Since I had eaten earlier in the night I just wanted something small so I got the tasting portion ($7) of the Lamb Bolognese Pasta. The house bucatini pasta was wonderful. The lamb sauce was flavorful and there was the perfect amount of it. Everything was topped with fresh basil and a just right amount of ricotta cheese.   The tasting portion was really small and it serves more as a one person appetizer than what one might consider a half or small portion compared to the full size. It was just what I wanted for this visit, but next time I come if I am more hungry I would seriously consider ordering the tasting portion of all 3 of the pastas just to try them and to create my own sampler entree.   The only thing I could possibly find wrong with this place is that the butter served for the bread was so cold it was not spreadable. But this can be overlooked and I would happily return here again.   All the staff we encountered were beyond friendly and accommodating. Being located on a corner in retail development area the patio is nice and quiet with little traffic. The interior appeared very warm and inviting as well. And yes, the door is really red."}
{"text":"We came for Valentine's Part 2 and ate at the bar.  The hostess was lovely, welcoming and completely understood my request to eat romantic dinners at the bar!  The foos was great - we ordered the pork bell and lobster taco to start.  I would get the pork belly again - great flavor, nice size, perfectly cooked, but the lobster taco was tine and seemed like it was in some sort of goo.  But the lobster meat was fresh.  We shared the frisee salad, which was good and had nice bacon lardons and poached egg.    The tuna for dinner was fantastic!!  Perfectly rare and served with a shrimp cake and bok choy.   The atmosphere was crowded and lively.  It was defintely a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend surprised me by making reservations at the chefs counter last night. I was really looking forward to a night out and some good food. We were seated as soon as we arrived. Unfortunately that was the best part of the evening at ORD. Where I was seated still had the dirty half filled coffee cup from those who sat there before us. After sitting at the counter for nearly 15 minutes our waiter came by and filled our water. He didn't ask if we wanted a drink or anything to start the evening, which we both did and then left again. After another five minutes he came back to ask if we wanted anything to drink other than our waters. My girlfriend ordered a cocktail and while I was looking through their cocktail menu to make my selection he vanished into the back again! I can honestly say I have never walked out of a restaurant due to poor service until last night. I don't think I will be returning to ORD anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sat outside after looking at the menu. The young man bringing water knew nothing about the menu, but was firm in telling us \"happy hour is over.\" We were not there for happy hour. Our wait staff arrived and we had questions about the menu. We had seen the lunch menu outside. Again, we were told unequivocally, \"happy hour is over.\" Again, we were not interested in happy hour. We were curious if we may be able to order something from the lunch menu. Nope. It was enough of a turnoff for us to go next door, who got our money anyway. Note to management. Please ask your staff to wash their aprons. Our bus person and wait staff's aprons were filthy."}
{"text":"The salads on the ORD menu deserve a special shout out.  Salads can easily become dull afterthoughts, but not so here--they are generously portioned, with quality lettuces and a variety of deliciously fresh add-ins.  The Cobb salad was presented as a veritable mini buffet of proteins, veggies, and cheese.  Every element was totally tasty and the sum was very filling.  The lemon and chocolate mousse plates were also quite strong, especially when ordered together and sampled in alternating bites!  ORD has obviously become a staple of the Hudson dining scene, but it seems to continue to put out a dependably good product."}
{"text":"Ate there recently. Interesting menu, average food with above average prices. The best thing  was fried clam appetizer which really was wonderful. Grouper and risotto entree was unremarkable for too much money. Service was slow, confused and inattentive."}
{"text":"I grew up in the area and have lived in NY and DC since.  I was looking for a nice place to meet up with an old high school friend, and this lived up to expectations.  I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant.  It's kind of a mix between a lodge and a loft, but in the very best way.  I liked that while the restaurant is not quiet, you still have no trouble hearing each other.  The menu had a wide variety of good choices.  We tried the butcher's block sampler.  It was pretty tasty, although the duck prosciutto was mediocre.  For my main dish, I had the grouper.  The dish was good but a little on the salty side for my taste.  They have a drink menu that focuses more on wine than beer.  The choices for beer are good, with a few on draft and a bunch in bottles.  The wine list is more focused on American wines than European.  Overall, I had a good experience there.  The reason that I'm not giving 5 stars is because I think the price is slightly reaching beyond what you get."}
