{"text":"WOW
this place always delivers. I'm at the bar and Gabby is making the best fresh margaritas! 
I've been coming here for years.  this is one of my favorites in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"First time dining at this restaurant. We were greeted and sat at our table quickly. Food was good. Customer service was excellent. I would  recommend trying this place to anyone who is looking for a good Mexican restaurant. 

The only reason I give it 3 stars is because 3 of the people I was with ordered menudo and they were about to bring out our food and said they ran out of menudo."}
{"text":"Just left without eating. I ordered the \"ensalada hawiian chicken salad\". It was beautiful. It had no flavor.
I tried to get the attention of anyone working there. That took about 5 minutes.
When I asked for dressing the waiter looked and acted confused. The choices were ranch, italian or honey mustard. Hummm what would go well with a hawaiian salad that has pineapple and guacamole..... Really none of the mentioned. I ordered ranch. 
The waiter brought it to the table with a clunk. You would think with such a beautiful salad there would be a specialized dressing say with pineapple?
The ranch did not work. The salsa did not work (no flavor or heat) I am from southern California and have made / eaten lots.
Needless to say I will not be going back."}
{"text":"excellent food for a very picky eater!.. the chilaquiles were authentic and flavorful. The service was very friendly and the restaurant was very clean. We got a free postcard with our picture..  A must for all Las Vegas visitors!"}
{"text":"Chips, salsa verde, beans and queso were absolutely outstanding. I grew up in Phoenix but have lived in Oregon for thirty years and am Mexican food deprived. It is especially hard to find good chips in Oregon...Was in Las Vegas on a business trip and a large group of us went to Casa Don Juan. The service was fast and friendly but I just cannot get over how good the chips were. The guacamole was good too, chunky and obviously fresh made. My margarita was also outstanding. I asked the server for better than well or Jose Cuervo and I said to surprise me and it was really really good. Since I go to Las Vegas twice a year for work I'm planning on eating at Casa Don Juan again."}
{"text":"Best mexican restaurant I have had the pleasure of enjoying in Las Vegas. The food is plentiful and affordable. Had my birthday dinner there twice now and they definitely pull out the stops for the celebration. The fajitas are FAJITABULOUS! and the service matches the food."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas!! I always order the Chilaquiles. My husband and I are Mexican and a little picky of where we eat our Mexican food. This place is our spot!. My 4year old loves it and we get a complimentary photo to take with us, so I have plenty of photos of myself with my family. We get great service and if we want anything special for my 4year old they always accommodate.  I didn't give them a 5 star only because the parking...well it sux to find a good parking spot, however the car shop behind them are very kind and will let us park in their business parking lot."}
{"text":"Fiancé and I went for dinner last night and it was delectable! Wait staff was EXCELLENT, prompt and attentive. I've been coming here for years and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best Mexican restaurant. Absolutely recommended & excellent service. & ask for Ivan, he's the best server..."}
{"text":"A little mediocre tasting, but the atmosphere was nice, don't get the guacamole, or if you do ask them to put salt and lime in it because it's very bland. I had the shrimp tacos, not the best, but our servers were nice always made sure to fill our waters. Try their desserts! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE !!!!!!! I live in Vegas , and I approached this place it was my first time here and it won't be my Last !!!!! Everything was amazing"}
{"text":"Can I give this place zero stars?  EVERYONE at our table of 8 got terrible FOOD POISONING!!!!  All 8 of us we sick for 5 days after eating here last Saturday night.  I really hope that management reads this and responds..."}
{"text":"This used to be a favorite of my family, but our last couple of visits not so much. After a dissatisfied service a few months ago we gave it a break and then tried again today. And again disappointing. Service was definitely lacking. Waiter didn't fully know the lunch specials, before they had a paper that came with the menus showing lunch specials but not any more. Food was satisfactory at best and from what I was told of my group. As for mine, I decided to step away from my regular enchiladas and try the shrimp burrito that was I believe $14. That definitely was nothing special especially in presentation. A burrito on a plain plate, no sour cream, no lettuce.
Roberto's and Fausto's in the area have a shrimp burrito for half the price that kills this.

 Something here has changed from what it's been in the past."}
{"text":"The food was excellent although the chip basket they brought out for the salsa and bean dip was full of nothing but broken pieces of chips. The service on the other hand is HORRIBLE! We only saw out waiter twice, once to take our order and the other time was to drop off our food. We had to have a bus boy hunt him down just so we could pay the bill and get back to work."}
{"text":"Second review... I gave five stars the first time but the chimichanga was not what I would expect from a Mexican restaurant. The food here is just okay... Maybe I'm just used to home made Mexican food because my mom cooks so delicious. 
I say give it a try and judge for yourself. My husband really likes the shrimp tostadas."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Casa Don Juan for over 15 years.  It looks like they have designated parking spots in the back so you can hopefully find parking. It can be difficult to find parking during peak lunch times.  My friends love this spot and if you are in the downtown area, I don't think you can go wrong here.

The food here is above average, meaning it's not the best I've had in Las Vegas, but definitely not the worst.  The prices here are on the more expensive side, but it won't completely break the bank.  It can get busy during the lunch hour for all the professionals working downtown. 

The service here is excellent and that's really their strength.  They will make your guacamole to order, the chips and salsa are really good.  The tortillas are made at the restaurant.

The machaca con huevos (eggs) are legit and authentic.  I've had burritos here, enchiladas, chorizo with eggs and they are spot on.  All in all, it's a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Our first time eating at this wonderful restaurant while visiting Las Vegas. Our friends suggested this restaurant for our lunch meeting and we were so impressed with everything from upon our arrival. The food is great and everything is made from scratch and not canned or frozen. I am from San Antonio TX and know Mexican food and this place ranks high up there.  We will be returning to this restaurant for sure! 
The only problem is parking, but keep driving around and you will find place on the street."}
{"text":"Went here on a Groupon. Very friendly staff staff. Great service. I had a wet asada burrito and it was good- really good by Vegas Mexican standards. (Why can't we get banging Mexican here-we have plenty of Mexicans? No dis there whatsoever-just can't figure it out.) Denver had way better Mexican food) The wife had the grilled shrimp and it was very tasty she said. With out Groupon- I never would have found this place. I am glad I did. 
Not crazy good- but better than 95% of the other places I have been to here in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love Casa Don Juan, Its a great place to eat delicious Tamales and Tacos. Depending on what day and/or time you go, it'll be a hit or miss. More than often its great, but on those bad days its just average. For the newbie, I would recommend the Tamale and Taco Combo! The Beef Fried Taco is the BOMB and the Cheese and jalapeno Tamale is so delicious. I feel its all up to who the cook is that day and how busy they are."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Great service! Super excited for the new Summerlin location!

I would recommend the Cadillac margaritas. BEST MARGARITAS IN VEGAS PEOPLE!
And as for food, I would have to say the Carnitas (#10) is what I usually order and it never fails. Me and my family will definitely be returning soon!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  the service is dead on and the food is soooo damn good! They just renovated the bar and it looks great.  The decor and the uniforms are great - really adds to the place. I usually get the Tamele and the tacos... man my mouth is watering just writing about the food."}
{"text":"Fast service. Casa Don Juan has your run of the mill tex-mex with other native Mexican/South American dishes on the menu. The pricing is fair and the margaritas are exceptional(I believe they carry Cazadores, one of my favorite tequila brands. The serving are usually huge and I can never finish my plate. It's a good place for a first date and other casual social occaisions."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious !!!! Maybe even better then lindo michoacan !! It's the same prices as them plus they make their tortillas fresh !! My new favorite spot ! & the service is great, very attentive."}
{"text":"While having a girls day with my mom and two of my sisters, we decided to go out to eat at Casa Don Juan. We arrived early and walked around waiting for my mom and sister to arrive. As we walked back to the restaurant, my sisters car was being towed away. We tried to talk to the man towing it and my sister went in to the restaurant to explain the situation. When she spoke to the manager, the manager was rude. She rolled her eyes and said that it's not her problem. When my mom and sister came we paid the fine and still tried to come in to eat. When we arrived she was talking about the situation in front of me and my family, unaware that we spoke Spanish. Everyone seemed uncomfortable with us, especially when my sister walked in. My sister with the car that was being towed was hesitant to come in, but decide to try to enjoy lunch there despite the rude manger. We had a couple of drinks and chips with dip, but feeling so uncomfortable, we decided to leave. As we walked out my sister asked for the manager's name and she mumbled it and said something under her breath. My sister said, \"I'm sorry, did you say something?\" And the lady said, \"you come in and only have water? Bye! Bye! Bye!\" It was completely professional and rude. We will never return."}
{"text":"One of the best mexican restaurant in town. Their lemonade is absolutely out of this world--be sure to order a pitcher of it! And you drink piña colada straight from a pineapple too! Very creative. I am always craving for their chile relleno. You will,for sure come back for more! Great place and atmosphere for family. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came to lunch with my sister! After reading so many good reviews, decided to give it try! Amazing service by Jose E. And Antonio H. Amazing food! It you have a big appetite this is a must! Big portions! I had the #35 Wet Burrito (Lengua or Tongue) and My sister had the #1 Chicken Breast with a Cactus Salad!"}
{"text":"This place ripped me off, they charged me $13 for a bean and cheese burrito wet (ala carte). Just beans cheese and red sauce. I know I probably should've asked the price before ordering but it typically at most restaurants it's a cheaper option. I thought that they made a mistake on our bill so I asked them about it and they seemed to think that is perfectly fine to charge that much for a not even that big burrito all by itself. Up until then the service was good though."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the Art district I always visit Don Juan. The plate portions and lunch specials are irresistible here! Guacamole is ALWAYS fresh and Horchata is cooler than ice cold. The food is mildly authentic and the decor more kitch. Restrooms are maintained and the staff goes out if their way to be more than accommodating for any dietary/allergy needs. Thanks CDJ"}
{"text":"Walking in you feel the upbeat and friendly atmosphere in the very festively decorated restaurant. Had a groupon which they happily accepted and told us about the history of the family-owned restaurant since it was out first time there. We started with guac and the complimentary salsa and beans, which I thought were a little bland. We each got a sampler plate and here is where I think they nailed it. I had a steak taco on a homemade corn tortilla and it was downright delicious. The tamale was also homemade and not your store bought style tamale. The corn wrapping was thick and granular (the way I like it) and the filling an awesome shredded spice pork. Definitely going to go again an try some more items. Will keep you posted!"}
{"text":"We originally came in to this restaurant on a groupon.  We enjoyed their margaritas, as well as the queso dip that comes with the chips, something that many other Mexican restaurants don't offer.

Went in there tonight.  Started out with the chips, and right away we were informed that they did not have the queso dip, and it would take too long for us to get some.  Strange that they would be out of queso dip at 530 PM, but OK, they brought us the chips with their (as other reviews have stated) lard-based bean dip and a watery, uninteresting salsa.  My wife asked for a spicier salsa, and they brought out a coffee-cup sized serving of some reddish-orange fluid, which to her had at least a little more taste.

The meal was certainly passable....I enjoyed my carne asada enchiladas, and the carnitas de puerco con guacamole was OK as well.  When the bill came, the total was $63 for three people, including soft drinks and upcharges for guacamole (I get it) and spicy salsa (really!).  I guess if I had read Sella G's unsatisfactory review of this restaurant from August 6, I might have known.....but since I had been here a few times, and usually order queso dip, I had no idea that they were charging for salsa (that you have to ask for after first receiving bland, watery stuff at no additional charge).

You know when something annoys you, but you might not make a big deal about it?  That's kind of how I felt when I went to pay (at Casa Don Juan, the waitstaff does not take your money, but you are expected to go line up at the cash register to pay).  I handed the lady behind the counter a $100 bill and my ticket, which she took.  Then, without looking up, she says 'And how was everything?'

If you  are going to ask that question, then I figure you want to know that I am leaving the restaurant annoyed, so I mention the thing about the salsa.   She says 'hold on, let me get the manager'.  She doesn't see the manager, and says (in a worried tone) 'wait, don't leave'.  Well of course I'm not going to leave....she has my $100 bill in her hand, and I haven't got change....and whether or not they adjust the bill, I will still need change.  

So the manager gets there.  I tell her about the salsa, and told her that I did not know there was a charge'.  Her response was that she saw my wife ask for it, and yes, there is a charge.  She has the power, and she is \"right\"....and the restaurant will be charging me for the salsa.

In that moment, I let her know that I would never return, and would be posting my experience on social media.  She didn't even look at me, and told the lady at the cash register to charge me the full bill.  I didn't expect that tonight was my last visit ever to Casa Don Juan, but it seems to have worked out that way.  I guess the by-product of this is that it got me to sign up for Yelp!, which I had never done before, and write my first review.  And while I have introduced this restaurant to others that I know, it will be an interesting exercise for me to see how many people I can convince to avoid this restaurant.

As for paying for the salsa, I only 'sort of' apologize to the wait staff that it was deducted from what I would consider a normal tip, but they participated in this by either inadvertently not telling us there was an upcharge when we asked for spicier salsa or by knowingly not telling us of this upcharge and hoping that we wouldn't notice or care when the bill came.  Either way, I'm not too worked up that they were tipped a little less, and I am comfortable that I didn't end up bearing any of the cost that was intended to accompany the combined lack of communication and snitty attitude.  

Memo to the management  it's worse to ask someone if they're satisfied if you aren't going to care.  Good luck collecting $3 annoyance charges to people who don't know they are incurring them.  You took a little money that would have been given to your wait staff, and you now have not only a former customer, but someone who will actively encourage others to avoid your restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was authentic and delicious. They were very accommodating. I had the carne asada plate for lunch and meet was cooked well.  Service was good."}
{"text":"We always try to stop here when saying downtown.  Good food and friendly service.  Love the chips and bean dip.  Steak fajitas are plentifully, enchiladas are great, and the margaritas are delish."}
{"text":"I wish I had this place on a daily basis. Ginormous, amazing portions of food. We went there twice with 3 - 5 people so we tried 8 - 10 different dishes, all spectacular. The bartender hooked us up with awesome margaritas. We had our photo taken and given a free souvenir postcard :) Every dish was superb, the staff was nice, food came quickly. Yummy chips & salsa beforehand which they generously replenishes. All in all, a wonderful place."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite restaurant. I ate there probably 3 to 4 times a week for about five years straight. The service has recently gone downhill and they now charge for their salsa. I find that to be absolutely absurd that a take-out order does not come with a side of salsa for free. Being that I'm a long-time customer you think that they would not up the price on salsa for me but that wasn't the case. I will no longer be eating there. I have never in my life been to a Mexican restaurant and charged for Salsa when I do a take out order. That's like ordering French fries and being charged for ketchup!!! Crazy! Sorry Casa Don Juan, you guys lost a great cu"}
{"text":"Delicious enchiladas, fast service. Kind of in the ghetto, but quick to get to from the north end of the strip."}
{"text":"Food is alright. Nothing out of the extraordinary. Chiles rellenos were disgusting. Seafood is ok. I was in a party of two and they charged me 18% service in my bill like if I was in a large party. Also, they have a photographer who claims that pictures are free. However, they are not. They cost $25 for 2 pictures. They are misleading their customers. Lastly, restrooms are awful. I recommend to go down the street to Tacos Mexico."}
{"text":"Good authentic Mexican food. And the aguas are GOOD! Try the mango flavor.  It's a big restaurant, and the service is good.

There's a private lot, but it's only for a couple of spots, so the street parking on Main Street is a better bet."}
{"text":"My wife and I LOVE this place. Their queso dip is SO good. The atmosphere is great and it's location in the older downtown of Vegas is charming. They have an entire wall dedicated to Frida. 

Gabby the bartender is fantastic as are their chefs. 

The only downside is they do not have the  made at the table side guacamole but that doesn't warrant any reduction to the 5-star rating. Their daily guac is tasty and did I mention that queso?"}
{"text":"Food was great! We got the groupon which had two dinner entrees and two margaritas. The margaritas were virgin! No alcohol what's so ever. I get that they are trying to make money as a business but seriously don't hear people. I usually visit this place but I won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in just about 20 min before they closed coming from one of the bars close by, they sat us, then didn't rush us at all, and mmm mmm mmm Erik the server was the perfect eye candy ending to an already awesome night! 

We ordered drinks and food from they late night specials menu, food was good, not amazing but good, it was also closing time so who knows... And around $6-$8 a plate. The beverages were really fun, one came in a bowl and it had like 5 types of alcohol in it and it was delish! 

The service was great, drinks were kept full and table cleared off frequently of empty glasses. Friendly staff and comfy booths. 

I'd go back for sure! They have a bar in there also that has some tv screens and the restaurant section is a pretty good size. 

Cool decor and fun vibe. Decent food. I will have to go back and eat when they are not closing. But I had the Pollo Mole and it was very good."}
{"text":"We were staying on the Strip but heard about this place and had to try it--it was worth the $10 uber trip! Food was AMAZING and FRESH! We got the queso and guacamole along with our free bean dip and salsa with the chips and it was delicious. We ordered the steak chimichanga, the chicken chimichanga and a chicken tamale. The tamale and chicken chimichanga were great but the steak chimichanga was by far the BEST! They don't skimp on the meat and the Flavor of it was out of this world. Our waiter Jesus was also friendly and checked on us often! He made our food recommendations and we couldn't be happier! Will definitely be coming back on our next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Called the restaurant from hops and nuts. Literally across the street. Hops and nuts provided the menu when we had asked what local restaurants delivered. We then proceeded to call this resistant to order food off of the current menu the partnered bar provided us. The lovely hostess Denise answered with an incredibly rude tone. She actually hung up on us a number of times on us stating she had no idea where hops was?? I provided the location I was calling from she continued to play dumb and act like we had no idea where this place was... It was next door... Literally right next door?? After realizing they might have someone new who had to clearly not know what neighboring business partners they had I offered to walk by. As I entered the building and let Denise she was nothing but rude and impolite. Far from anything a paid hostess would be. Hopefully management soon recognizes her poor performance and hires a better face for their business."}
{"text":"Excellent food at very reasonable prices. The carnitas plate and tortilla soup were stellar. This place was a short 10 minutes off the strip and was well worth the drive."}
{"text":"We went on a groupon and were also surprised how this groupon worked.. see all previous comments below.(it sucked)   Anyway we loved the salsa, bean dip and ordered a side of guacamole.. omg it was so tasty.  Food ordered was a Chimmi and Burrito.  Service was very good.  We certainly will try Casa Don Juan again.. although we have been by this place so many times before."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & great drinks!! Food is ok, the chicken mole and shrimp cocktails are delicious! Great place to spend an evening having drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Went for friends birthday dinner.. Food was good then we went to cut the cake we brought and the waiter said we couldn't cut the cake unless we paid the restaurant.. Wtf I have never heard such a thing.. Last time we will goto this place. Made a 17 year old feel bad on her birthday. Thank you casa don Juan..."}
{"text":"The food taste authentic and the staff is always friendly. I would highly recommend their Margaritas."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today. I had waited a while (years) to try this place because there are a handful of awesome Mexican restaurants in Vegas that I frequent regularly. After a numbers of years of thinking about trying this place, I wish I was still just thinking about it. There are much better Mexican eateries in Vegas!!  

My experience today included a super long wait from the time I was seated until the waiter (really sweaty guy) took my order. We're talking 20 solid minutes before I ordered. One redeeming thing at this point, the chips and salsa - the salsa flavor was good and unfortunately the highlight of the meal.

Ok, food comes. Very greasy beef taco, very, very greasy. That's just gross. Pork tamale - not bad but could have used more meat in the middle. Cheese enchilada was okay. There was something, like a noodle, in my beans. I noticed it about half way through. I don't know about you, but it's hard to keep eating after you find something weird in your food. Rice was just average. Sweaty waiter pretty much ignored me until the very end of my meal. I asked for a refresh on my completely empty water glass - it took a while but another man did eventully bring me a fresh water. Then the bill comes and I'm now in a rush to return to work, so I didn't look at the itemized check. I think I was over charged by at least a buck or two. Being in a rush I just blew it off. First and last time I go here. Period!

Conclusion, go to a better Mex spot! There are excellent places around town. Sadly, this is not one of them."}
{"text":"[Location is 1204 S. Main].  I really enjoyed the management and staff here. All were friendly and bilingual. More than willing to allow me to practice my Spanish.  The food was serve quick, and hot.  The (pineapple fruit) drink I had accompanied my Veggie tacos and guacamole tip nicely.  Only down side to this place was the chips.  I love good tortilla chips and Don Juan's didn't get me hot or bothered.  Still for the price, this place was a great value."}
{"text":"Our lunch was fantastic.  Shared the Carnitas for two and a couple of tamales.  Also had the guacamole.  The wait staff was great."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service prompt and friendly.  Space is comfortable.  Parking in back is a bonus."}
{"text":"Bad service, Javier and staff was very rude, I ended up not eating there , I changed my mind .."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. The margaritas are great...the shrimp tacos have no flavor, the cheese enchiladas weren't good flavor either. The red sauce tastes like it's out of a can. Meals were very expensive...lunch for 1 cheese enchilada, 1 shrimp taco, rice beans 13.00 pricy for substandard food."}
{"text":"Love the food here!!! Chips and salsa with bean dip... AWESOME!!! I agree with the consensus that they have slow serving but always very friendly!!! I like that they have a person walking around doing pictures for guests... Nice touch!!! Great finish to the meal was the Pina Colada served in a fresh Pineapple!!! DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"If you're visiting from out of town, do yourself a huge favor and dump the strip for a change. Why pay 4x more for shit food and poor service? My wife and I ate here tonight, and the only regret I have is that we didn't find it sooner. For less than $40 we both had a couple of Modelo beers on tap, she had two tacos Al Pastor and a slice of chocolate cake to go; I had 2 carnitas tacos and 1 chicken taco, plus all the chips, queso, and salsa we could shove down our throats. Service was fan-fuckin-tastic, and every bite was amazing. I honestly don't know why this place isn't rated 5 stars. Top quality ingredients made fresh, and tasty.  Try getting anything close to that anywhere on the strip anymore. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Make sure you ask very specific questions from the servers.. our server was not clear about happy hour and margarita prices so we ended up paying 60 dollars for 4 margaritas. The money wasn't the problem AT ALL. Just the fact that they were unclear about happy hour and margarita prices. In all honesty the food is good but the margaritas were not worth 60 dollars."}
{"text":"Great food, ambience and service. Visited twice on our Vegas trip - no complaints!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants 
In Vegas now...
  The portions are huge, the drinks are great,
Real Mexican at a great price....
 The service is also really good..
I had the steak burrito and mango margarita
Which were excellent.
   The fried Ice cream is to die for.
A must for anyone in town."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great authentic Mexican food. Service was fast and friendly. Ordered the cheese dip which was delish and the chips with salsa and bean dip was also delish. Ordered a Modelo chelada and it was one of the best I had. I ordered carne Asada tacos and they were awesome especially with the freshly made tortillas. You could actually see the employee making them from where I sat. Also the tacos were big. My friends ordered the fish, lengua, and shrimp tacos and they also loved the food."}
{"text":"Me and my wife were in town celebrating our Anniversary. We get a craving for good authentic Mexican food outside of the strip. Thanks to Yelp, we run into this place. We arrived pretty late (30 minutes before closing time). Luckily the waiter warmly greeted us, and did not make us feel as if we had to leave for arriving so late.

The chips and salsa are very good and fresh. They also provide you with a side of beans to enjoy with the aforementioned chips and salsa. I ordered a wet burrito and it was huge! Did not dissapoint. Extremely good!! Plus the waiter was always attentive and provided great service , despite it being past closing time.

So if your in town and need some really good mexican food.....this is the place."}
{"text":"yumm. if youre in vegas visiting, this place is a good place to go for lunch or dinner if youre not feeling like anotherrr buffet. Good service, great food, prices are reasonable! where else can you get guacamole for just 3$!? (not in california) and everything is home made! their tortillas and beans, omggg so GOOD!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  The atmosphere is very welcoming and the staff is super friendly.  

I always get the #22 plate...been here many times, and thats what i get every time (you don't mess with perfection).  all of our friends love this place, one of the best places to go in vegas for mexican food, and thats saying something"}
{"text":"The chicken tacos are arguably some of the best in town! The guacamole is a little too creamy for my taste. I prefer my guac to be made table side. Plus the fact that they get from the bartender makes me think that there's just a big vat of guac behind the bar. And that's the first thing you're asked when seated \"Would you like guacamole?\" I haven't had much else, I think the chile relleno was pretty tasty as well. Would give them 4 stars just for the chicken tacos, but the guac makes me take a star away."}
{"text":"Authentic good Mexican food. Tortillas are hand made and service is fast and friendly. They brought our chips and salsa right away. it's a bit pricey, but worth it!!"}
{"text":"We went on a groupon and the food was Ok but it seems their more Hispanic friendly the waiter didnt even come back to check on us I ordered more salsa which I never got and I agree with one other comment it seems they raise the price on groupon customers the chimichanga in the menu said 12.99 but they charged me 15.99 plus 2.00 for carne asada so at 17.99 it wasn't worth it Robertos is better for half the cost will not be back and I agree with other comments as far as the manager they don't have good customer service my sister had an encounter with the manager which my sister left she didn't even wanna eat there."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cool. Staff was attentive. Food however, was kind of disappointing. It was just OK, typical Mex food to me. Everything comes with rice and beans so not too much variety. I used a Groupon voucher which they did honor it but I don't think they were to happy that I was using it, they were speaking Spanish about it so not sure what the issue was. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is a must visit everytime we go to Vegas. The food is huge portions,, authentic and not overpriced.

I get the ceviche and my husband always gets the smothered burrito. The margaritas are awesome and great price! Service is super fast and very nice.

Try the cheese dip and the guacamole!

Making me hungry writing the review!"}
{"text":"Bomb tamales service and authentic food along w the Beutiful hostess dressed in authentic Mexican floral"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance and atmosphere. Mainly came to drink and they did not disappoint.  The chips, salsa and bean dip were yummy and filling. I have a groupon to use for a second visit which I want to do soon. Will most def be returning!"}
{"text":"Came here because the hubby has been wanting to try this place for the longest. I'm so sorry I waited so long!! This is authentic  Mexican food at its best! From the restaurant decor to the hand made tortilla station! My husband ordered the steak fajitas and I ordered a side salad and a shrimp ceviche tostada . The steak was well cooked and flavorful and they give u alot of steak! My tostada was delish!! The chips and salsa come with a bowl of refried beans that are just like my abuelita(grandma) use to make. 

Service was on point too! Our waiter Arturo was fast and attentive and super friendly! It's hard to find friendly waiters nowadays! I wish I receives this kind of service at every restaurant I went to:)
Now why did I give this place 4 stars and not 5 u ask??? My husbands fajitas only came with two flour tortillas!! Who can eat a large plate of delish steak fajitas with 2 tortillas!?? We asked our server for another tortilla and he politely said he would have to charge us for a order of tortillas! Come on owner of Casa  Don Juan!!! Stop being stingy on the flour tortillas! That being said , I would definitely come back to this place!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place as I always see that it's pretty busy, but I'm very disappointed at the food. We ordered a beef fajita plate and shared it between two people. It was definitely enough food, as they give a lot of beef, but the quality of the meat was horrible. I also told the waiter it was my boyfriends birthday and they sang, which was nice, but gave him a plate of whip cream!! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic probably the best Mexican food I've had in Las Vegas and I've been coming to Vegas for 10 years and the service is superb I give it 10 stars out of 5"}
{"text":"Great food,we come here often for lunch and always enjoy the food. Came for a group dinner on 1st Friday and enjoyed a wonder dinner with friends. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Very cute place inside.
Food was good, but not great. 
Service was pretty bad. 
*No children's menu*

I ordered 2cheese enchiladas with an order of beans and rice. $12.99. I did enjoy everything, the sides of rice and beans were kinda small. 
Zordon got the wet super burrito with green sauce. Rice, beans.  $13.99. The burrito was smaller than most and wasn't very good.
My littles got the flautas combo.  $13.99.. because they didn't have a children's menu.

Service: they all looked sad. Like they didn't want to me there. We had to ask them for water several times. They weren't very attentive. Then they sat a family of about 15 right next to us. Really?? They have enough room to leave some space for us. Anyway. Then as we leave the hostesses weren't any better. 

Decor was actually very cute. A little bit weird though, the obsession with Frida. Still, done well. 

I would consider giving this place a second chance if the prices weren't so high for the kind of food i get in any average Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! I loved the food quality and the service. The tan pequeña plate is the best! Wish we had a restaurant like this in Orange County!"}
{"text":"5 stars are for awesome service. 3 stars for food they serve retried beans and salsa w/chips great taste! I ordered shrimp toastada was okay the shrimp is not cooked w/the lemon :(  the hubby ordered the cheese tamale REALLY MOIST good taste! the rice was just okay. Ordered Michelada was not good. The strawberry margarita was not good either especially for $13."}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant is one of my pit stops every time I make a trip to Vegas. I don't mind driving a few minutes away from the strip to come and eat here. They have a large menu with many good choices. 
I highly recommend the chilaquiles with green sauce, and a Pina colada for a cocktail. I promise you will not be unhappy with those two choices. 

My only complaint at times is the staff. The majority of the time you will receive great customer service and friendly staff. 
BUT at times you may receive a staff member that can be inattentive and rude.  
Overall I would recommend this establishment very highly."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food while in Vegas, look to Casa Don Juan. We went to Dos Caminos in Palazzo the day before and I would pick CDJ in a heartbeat over Dos Caminos. 

First of all, the host told us to wait 2 1/2 minutes. As a joke, I timed him. We were seated in 2 minutes 27 seconds. HAHA!! Seriously. 

They give you free chips and salsa...and bean dip! Bonus! The guacamole is a must have. So fresh.

Everything is good here. Carnitas, machaca, chorizo, carne asada. Everything.

Service was excellent even though they were packed."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times and is not that great, yes they have homemade tortillas and some good dishes but it is way overpriced for what you get and the servers are pretty bitchy. So so place to eat mexican coming from a mexican."}
{"text":"I love this freakin place.  Maybe because I was raised in the southwest and have been living on the East Coast for the past 2 years, but now that I'm in Vegas for a conference.  I saw this place on Groupon and went for it.  Turned out to be the best decision I've ever made.  The carne asada is majestic.  I had the Super Burrito, stuffed with pollo and carne asada, and to my surprise, it is topped with sauce and guac.  it doesn't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Great food great service been coming here for many years now only bad thing is their toilets ,they need to replace at least the seats and maybe add more lighting in the restrooms other than that it's great here."}
{"text":"Literally the best Paloma I have had... If you are lucky enough to be served by Gabby PLEASE ask for one! Place was super clean, food was AMAZING and the staff was all super nice! Don't forget to get your fortune read by Freida on your way out ;)"}
{"text":"this place is a must when in Las Vegas especially on New Years morning love it n no wair"}
{"text":"So I'm a gringo as they refer to us-  A group of pale skinned honkies whose greatest contribution to the Mexican food culture is taco bell. I wouldn't know \"authentic\" Mexican food from plain old Mexican food but this place is really good. It's a far cry from the ultrabland shite we call Macayo's. The service was good, and we really enjoyed the food. The beef seemed to be  actual beef which was a really cool treat.  The burrito was huge, the salsa's great and I got a bueno vibe.(see what I did there?)

It's my first review, and yes I'm really like this in real life. You should add me as a friend cause I eat out alot, and I make with the laughing all the time."}
{"text":"Chips,salsa ,guacamole and bean dip good not great . Wife raved about chile rellano, it was good , I had the super burritto w carne asada, taste alright but it was cold. Chix tamale dry .  I would visit again, maybe off night I see potential in the food. Service was fine price was reasonable"}
{"text":"Not bad. Not outstanding. Super fast service. Very run of the mill without being a disappointment. Tastes a little pre-made. Could dim the lights a little at night to add some Don Juan ambiance. Warning: Heavy on the raw onions if you go there on a date :)"}
{"text":"I ate here based on a recommendation and the food was great. It was very authentic and seemed to be a locals place, which is always the best. The food was good and it came out very fast, The prices are very reasonable as well, especially as an escape from the high prices of the strip. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Okay let me preface this with I think this is a great Mexican American type fare for Las Vegas, if we were in San Diego where I prefer Mexican food I would probably rank this 3 stars.  All in all if yelp allowed half stars i would rank this 3 1/2, however based on the service I will say 4. However,  decent Mexican food, authentic or gringo, is hard for me to find in Las Vegas. I like that this place gives bean dip with their chips and their entrees (ranging typically from $12-16) are pretty good with decent portion size. They have a touristy decor. Also, they generally offer 3 lunch specials around $9. They draw a big downtown lunch crowd but service is quick at lunch. Parking can be hard, they have a lot out back but it is sometimes full then I am left to find parking down the street and hike in."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. My wife and I stopped to have some breakfast before my daughters competition we were both very satisfied. Someone who wrote previously that the salsa was bland must've fell and bumped her head. This place is worth your time and money."}
{"text":"We came early in the morning for breakfast.  It was just perfect, although is a little far from the strip (if your vacationing in vegas) it's worth the drive. 
I had the green chilaquiles, my wife the red ones, and I can tell you it was an authentic Mexican kitchen flavor, too bad I forgot to take a picture.
The decoration is really nice with art of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo all over the restaurant, the restrooms clean and beautifully decorated.
Definitely we have to come back and taste their dinner menu, I wouldn't doubt it must be delicious."}
{"text":"Don't even waste your valuable time in SIN CITY going to this place. 1st off we get there a party of 12 , they bring chips and salsa right away which we're good, but then the horror starts. We get this rude ass waiter , gets all of our drinks all mix up by the way had the worst Chabela there. I had 7 MARES and it had a nasty taste.The meals took for ever not to mention they ran out of MENUDO, who the HELL runs out of menudo on Saturday morning. Anyway we were all unhappy with food, service, and drinks . And to top it off the dude had all of our separate bills all mix up. don't waste your time and just go to MI LINDO MICHOACÁN on desert blvd. best Mexican food in LAS VEGAS"}
{"text":"I always have a great experience at this restaurant. Food is always delicious, service is always accommodating and friendly, and prices are fair. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I have visited this establishment several times (15+).  I have left another review under a different user name, however; tonight I am done with this place.  I ordered food to go at the bar.  I received my order (unchecked since it's been great previously), got home, and it was wrong.  I live less than 2 miles from this place and the hospitality was less than gracious after paying them.  

I asked either my food be replaced and delivered after having to drive there myself or my money be refunded.  The joke was on me.  The management was the epitome of backing up an employee who got stuff wrong.  Unfortunately, the conversation was left that I was incorrect.  

I typically abuse YELP for recommendations, and, I know it's bad to rely on others.  However; after this experience, I'm all in on reviews. 

After calling the offer was for me to come back, get a new entree and leave.  No way to get a credit for what I paid for initially.  I will never go back. THIS PLACE IS A JOKE .

Whoops.  Bonito Michoacan IS SO MUCH BETTER ANYWAY!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my long time Vegas faves. Great prices, great portions and a warm family environment. This place really maintains a sense of consistency. Can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing guacamole you must try it.  Reasonably priced.  Show up before six for happy hour."}
{"text":"Best fish taco I ever had!! Food, service and clean! Coming back for sure!! My family had enchiladas and tamales.... They were in heaven! Can't stress how friendly staff was!"}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in you are greeted by superb staff. I went to Casa Don Juan with family and friends for a birthday, definitely a family friendly environment in case you have little ones.. The menu was extraordinary to say the least, so many choices, and also a wide selection of drinks. The waiters were very attentive and came to check on us frequently to make sure everything was okay, which i loved because that lets me know they care about their customers.  Who doesn't love to feel like they are being catered to? :) i recommend Casa DOn Juan to all of my friends and family, a must try i would rate it a 10 out of 5!"}
{"text":"Terrific authentic Mexican food. This place is fun, friendly, and just plain awesome."}
{"text":"Every time i come here service is great and the food is good! I love the atmosphere! Everything about this place is exceptional! I frequent quite often!! Def worth my drive!"}
{"text":"4 of us came here with low expectations, and I'm still giving this place 1*. 

None of us were at all pleased with what we got. The only saving graces are:
* We probably didn't need to eat that much food anyway, so leaving 1/2-3/4 of our food was ok
* Right down the block from the Velveteen Rabbit, one of our favorite little spots for a drink.

Will not be back. Things said during our dinner: Too dry, flavorless, gross, something seems wrong.

To be fair, I've actually *heard* from someone that this place is decent, and they were shocked at my feedback. I hope I'm wrong, but our experience was atrocious.

Even the chips and salsa: the chips were stale and the salsa was awful.

There's plenty of better food around -- don't waste a meal here."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Mexican and Latin food for many years. This last trip to Casa Don Juan was below average. Our waiter was not  very attentive, he dropped off our check before asking for or suggesting desserts.

My Chicken Mole was a lot of sauce and very little chicken....And the plate that it was served on was red hot... not a good sign.

It was an early Sunday evening and not too busy, hence I didn't understand the poor service and food."}
{"text":"Great food here. The guacamole is amazing... It's close to the Premium Outlets North too. Well worth eating here if you're visiting Vegas and want some really good Mexican food.  [This review left by an Aussie guy who loves eating mexican food when I come to the USA!]"}
{"text":"No stars for this place! Been here in 2 occasions for lunch meetings, glad I did not pay for overpriced wanna be Mexican food, this garbage is NOT Mexican food! It's an insult to call it Mexican food!.....

Hortchata, NOT home made like the server stated, I returned it and asked for plain water instead. Beef in the enchilada...was way too salty, I had to dissect my enchilada and just eat the tortilla. My co-worker ordered carnitas, she only ate about an 1/8th of the top portion, because they were drenched with grease, all the grease had made its way to the bottom of the plate, not only that; but it did not look fresh at all."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?!  This has been one of our favorite restaurants for quite a while but due to our last visit it has been removed from our list of eateries.  We popped in on a Saturday evening around 5pm.  We were seated right away and asked for 2 waters.  Our waitress took our order, 2 vegetarian burritos, one without cheese.  They arrived 2 minutes later.  That seals their fate for me.  That is a blinking sign that it is a conveyor belt restaurant.  No accommodation for quality, just slap the pre-cooked ingredients together and get the food out so the customer can scarf it down so we can clear the table and seat it again.  Don't worry about offering a nice atmosphere or enjoyable meal.  We asked the waitress for some salsa or red sauce to put on top of our burritos and she replied by glaring at us and saying what do you want - the salsa or red sauce.  For some reason it took way longer to get the red sauce then the actual entrees but when it did arrive it was accompanied by the bill.  Again, scarf the food, clear the table.

I had to request a refill on my water, sorry for putting her out with that request.  The bill reflected a $4 charge for the red sauce, nice!   I try to recognize the good even when it is overshadowed by the disappointing so I will say that the restrooms were clean."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, flat out. We went here on a tip from my future mother-in law, and it was fantastic. Friendly and attentive service from the staff, a BANGIN' Cadillac margarita, and best of all, awesome eats! I had the carnitas. This perfect portion of pork was nice and moist, and flavorful beyond belief! Another point for the hand-made tortillas that are \"hecho con amor\".

We all cabbed it here, and when we were done, the waiter went outside to flag us a cab! Now THAT is good service! We WILL return!"}
{"text":"Always busy, family atmosphere, great food. Complimentary chips, salsa, and beans to start. Guacamole is a must buy. On weekends have a dessert table set up for cash purchases. Fast service, attentive waiters, and good is delicious! Neighborhood is a little rough, so be safe while parking and going in."}
{"text":"Location: 1204 S. Main St. LV, NV. I purchased a Groupon for $25, which was supposedly worth $46. They advertise this deal which supposedly comes with 2 Margaritas worth $10 each. Therefore, it seems that you are ahead $21 or saving 46% when you buy this Groupon. But at the end they will charge you for the 2 Margaritas $20 - so that wipes out your savings. If you don't drink then you're S.O.L. Overall, the Groupon should simply just say 2 free Margaritas. Because the rest of the food, you'll be paying FULL PRICE. Don't buy this Groupon - it's a Rip Off and  not worth it!

We've only seen our waiter once when he took our order. The rest of the time, the bus boys in blue shirts will serve you. Once in a while you will see the waiters in black counting their tips by the cashier. Their prices are inflated and the Fajitas are bland and are below standard for the price. They don't include sour cream when they serve the Fajitas and will charge you extra if you ask for it.

An in house lady will ask to take your picture for \"FREE\", but will come back to sell you a bigger version for $15 (similar to what they have at an amusement park) I guess it for \"Memories at Casa Don Juan. Really?

Needless to say, I won't be coming back here any more..."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. The sauces and bean dip were on point. The margaritas were ok but the overall experience was good."}
{"text":"\"Yelp fail!!\" - Everyone at my table

Unfortunately, my family's experience at Casa Don Juan was not the greatest.  While the free chips, salsa and bean dip were great (it's kind hard to screw that up), the food we paid for was not very good.

I ordered an a la carte Al Pastor Taco and the Pork and Red Sauce Tamale.  The taco was, truly, the worst taco I've ever had. EVER.  My mother, who also ordered the same taco, spat it out and pushed the plate away.  The flavor and texture of the meat was all off.  Rubbery would be a good adjective -- Tacos El Gordo, this is not.  

My tamale was dry, dry, dry and the advertised \"red sauce\" was barely noticeable.  There was really no flavor to the pork and, overall, was a really bland dish.  Definitely would not order this again. 

I'm probably going to give the Casa a second chance.  I enjoyed the ambiance and the service was friendly. Maybe I just ordered the wrong things."}
{"text":"Great food plus attentive service makes me a happy boy. You could tell the food was from scratch. Margaritas were spot on."}
{"text":"Some of the best food in town. Family atmosphere with the utmost professionalism. Traditional and authentic! Order up and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Why did I come here? I already know how mediocre this place is and I still came.  Wet Burrito was flavorless and the manager said \"its great\" and basically said I was wrong.  Casa Don Juan makes Macayo's seems like grandma's cooking.  Never coming back....this review is a reminder to myself!"}
{"text":"Casa Don Juan has some of the best authentic Mexican food in Vegas. And having some of the best margaritas isn't bad either...if you have never had a tamarind margarita you need to try them!! Best in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, good food, nice ambience. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. My food was fresh, hot and tasty."}
{"text":"Went to Casa Don Juan last night with my family and absolutely loved it! Ricardo our server was very personable and funny. He made sure he was on top of everything and that we enjoyed our meal. The food was the most authentic I've had in Vegas thus far. My enchiladas dish was great and the recommendation of the Verde sauce was on point. The fireball ochata was a first for all of us and now a favorite. Definitely going back! A Little pricey but worth it!

-Joseph"}
{"text":"i have  been here twice now only to sit at the bar.  the chips and salsa are great!!!  it takes a while for the bartender to warm up to you... but we had a great time in the end.  we went with the bartenders recommendation for the carnitas tacos.  freakin amazing! you must go."}
{"text":"This location compared to the location they opened in the northwest valley on buffalo are worlds apart. Bean dip with flavor fresh tasting chips and far better food quality, technical work and presentation. Better atmosphere but still great service as at the location on Buffalo.  If that location wants to keep going  they need to take a lesson from the original."}
{"text":"After reading that this restaurant was opening a 3rd location, I decided it was worth a trip to find out just how good the food was. As I walked into the restaurant, I was surprised by how rude the staff was. There was no greeting or assistance. The food (#13 and a fish ceviche tostada) tasted bland. The icing on the cake was when my fiancé felt something crawling on his arm. He looked down and saw that a roach had crawled from his arm onto the window. He quietly notified staff to tend to the matter. A server came out with a fly swatter to kill it, but left it lying somewhere in the booth behind us. We both woke up this morning sick from food poisoning. Avoid this dirty restaurant."}
{"text":"Super fun atomosphere!! Perfect for a date night or even a birthday party. We started out with chips and bean dip. The cheese dip is hands down amazing though. I had a Pina Colada which was prepared and brought out to me in a pineapple. Talk about yummy! My boyfriend had a Watermelon Margarita that was not only smooth, but refreshing and tasteful. I would definitely recommend it. To eat I had shrimp ceviche tostadas that were huge. I could barely eat one. My boyfriend got a cheese enchilada combo and let's just say his plate was spotless when he was done. We topped off the night with fried ice cream which hit the spot. We would recommend this place to everyone. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"We come here about once a month, but this time, it took the tortilla maker FOREVER, and then overcooked.  The worse part the chef was leaning out of the kitchen dropping the f bombs while we ate.  
Maybe we came on a bad day?"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious! The service is great everytime Ive been there! Ive had the menudo which is my favorite and it taste homemade. The rolled tacos melt in your mouth! The wet burritos are delicious and the beef is super tender! Best mexican food Ive had reminds me of my grandmas cooking."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon ...2  entrees for free; so hubby and I dined there.  Since the Groupon was for lunch  we went on a Saturday a little after 3pm.  After we ordered, was told their lunch ended at 3pm so we couldn't use the Groupon. Menu advertised lunch/dinner items with no difference in prices. Meal was fine.  Waiter was somewhat standoffish with non-Hispanic customers.  

Didn't want to lose my money for the Groupon so we went back a week later before lunch hour was over.  Showed the Groupon before we ordered so there would be no more errors.  Was told the meal couldn't be over $21.98.  The stipulation on the Groupon didn't say that but whatever.  Our waiter was very nice and friendly.  The meal was good, however my husband wasn't impressed. Had never know of this place without he Groupon.  Very large and spacious restaurant.  Not very busy on both visits.

One Great thing, the food was delivered to our table in record time.  It was as if the cook heard us when we ordered the food.  

The salsa was better than most Mexican eateries. 
May come back when on a all ladies outing."}
{"text":"Casa Don Juan is a simple \"neighborhood\" type of restaurant located just off the Las Vegas strip.  It serves a wide assortment of basic Mexican food at very moderate prices in its large, comfortable dinning room.

A friend of my wife and me, who has been a customer for many years, took both us of there for dinner.  We started with guacamole and tortilla chips that was fresh, well prepared, and creamy.  For our entrées my wife had the Carnitas de Puerco (pork, guacamole, rice, beans and pico de gallo), and I had the Puerco en Chile Verde (pork, green chile sauce, rice, and beans).  Flour and corn tortillas accompanied our meals.  Our dishes were very well prepared with quality ingredients, nicely seasoned, flavorful, and fresh.  The meat was tender and delectable.  The beans and rice were very good accompaniments, and the tortillas were hot off the griddle.  The service was extremely attentive and unhurried.

Casa Don Juan is highly recommended for its delicious food, excellent service, very reasonable prices, and enjoyable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very good and consistent.  Nice place to go for an inexpensive lunch.  Never in the area for dinner so I don't know how it is there, but I would think it's just as good."}
{"text":"The food was good however the service was a constant feeling of rush rush rush and had to practically beg for refills...will not be back"}
{"text":"Food was decent but the price made it taste worse. I couldn't believe a combo plate for enchiladas was almost $10. I could go to rubios or Baja fresh for the same type of meal for half the price. I would probably not go again bec of the price. Mexican food should not cost this much."}
{"text":"They charge for  little thing they should rude service I know is a Mexican joint but on  Sundays am I like to watch American football I sat on a table that a TV was on a game tree times the try to change the TV with out asking  I was  with a teem jacket and did not care 
I guess is part of the atmosphere of that joint I went to the bathroom well I post the picks I la get flag 
No toilet paper  good thing I'm a guy I went back to the dinner room I got a whole pack of napkins.... 
That place suck!!!
It will be cool to go and try few meals give a few bites 
And .... a I did not like this ...... or this....... or the next one ... so long 
THEY CAN NOT MAKE YOU PAY FOR FOOD THAT YOU NOT LIKE  ..... JUST DON'T EAT ALL ....
THANKS ....."}
{"text":"Best guacamole in town! Delicious Mexican food with freshly made fruit juices. Never experienced bad customer service here."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant great service fabulous drinks and free parking couldn't ask for more. Make sure you put this on your list of places to visit in Vegas. Don't forget to try the jalapeño margarita it's a mind altering experience"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the quality of the food is poor and the customer service is even worse!   

Staff messed up our order (brought us someone else's order) then told us they couldn't exchange it.  The server called the manager and the manager told him it would come out of their paycheck (these words between staff were exchanged in an area full of customers).  When our food (our correct order came) it was cold and and they replaced the limes with lemons.  We asked for limes and were told \"no\" because they (the servers) had been instructed to only use lemons since limes were more expensive.  
Also, they then ran my card twice on the same transaction and when I called to have it corrected they accused me of coming in twice on the same day, not the case.  

Overall, just plain awful or maybe it was just my luck."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas I always stop at Casa Don Juan This place has really good food, The Margaritas are amazing all of them!! My favorite thing about this Restaurant is the customer service all the waiters and every one there Is Very attentive and very nice and sweet"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Jorge and Alfredo were awesome. Came all the way from California to visit family and this is not the first time we come to eat here. Everyone is so welcoming and nice. Great place for a family lunch in."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place. So, I finally did. We had the jalapeño  queso appetizer dip. It was really good. I ordered the tilapia, whole fish pan fried with garlic and it comes with rice and beans.  My friend ordered the tamales with beef taco plate. My food was pretty good. I just did not like the rice and refried beans. They seem generic to me. When I say that, I mean they taste like out of the can and not fresh. I am really harsh on refried beans because they taste the same everywhere. The tamales were ok. 

The problem with Mexican food, in my opinion, is that it's so difficult to determine what is good, bad or mediocre. 

The service was very good. Maybe...I 'll give this place another shot in the future."}
{"text":"We popped into Casa Don Juan for dinner last night. We got our usual carnitas for two and tamale, both were fantastic. The surprise tonight was the salsa and guacamole were also delicious. The salsa was nice and chunky with a little kick and the guac was so fresh and well seasoned. I hope they keep it up."}
{"text":"We here came for lunch.  Food was good and it has  very friendly staff.  Ivan was our host.  He's was very accommodating, friendly, and funny.  I will definitely come back here again.  And with Groupon,  common!!!  You can't beat that. ..."}
{"text":"Walking around the neighborhood came by Casa Don Juan.  It was very busy for a Sunday morning and I can see why!  This is authentic.  Great atmosphere and great food.  The service was outstanding.  Planning on going back to indulge!"}
{"text":"I love hole in the wall places and this is definitely one of them.  The staff is nice, the place is unique (I love dia de los muertos skulls a lot!) , and the food is great. Not fancy, not over the top, but delicious none the less.

 I also love how FAST they are. I order, I blink, and then my food is there! It is great when I want decent Mexican food on the go and close to that side of town. 

 If I had to leave my car for a couple hours at the shop I go to up the street, I can just walk down to Mr. Don Juan's place, throw back some beers ( or margaritas), have a bite to eat, and then walk back up to my car satisfied! 

The atmosphere, the music (sometimes), and everything really about this place is welcoming and comfortable. If you are downtown check it out!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican Restaurant in town. We love coming here. Best menudo ever! Staff are wonderful and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever amazing house tequila and the service is spot on I highly recommend this place will always come back"}
{"text":"Over Thanksgiving weekend, we walked the Arts District and thought we would try Casa Don Juan for lunch.  The food and drink were absolutely exceptional, making us embarrassed to have been here for many years and not tried it previously.  It was so enjoyable that prior to a Smith Center show this past Sunday, we took friends to share in the experience.  It could not have been more different than the previous visit.  The Patron margaritas were not nearly as good as before (tasted watered down) and two of four food orders were incorrect.  They really have to work on consistency.  As a result, not certain if we will have a return visit."}
{"text":"I don't think I have any complaints at all about this place. Dang good food, super service and very good prices. I am here once a week stuffing my gut."}
{"text":"I came here a couple weeks ago and am finally getting around to reviewing some places I liked. A few friends from work came with me and we arrived about 5pm for diner. We made reservations and our table was set nicely upon arriving, no waiting is good. 

This was my first time here and it was a very good experience. The place is nice and comforting, paintings on the wall, colorful flags across the ceiling, and very clean. When we were walking to our table I noticed that they make their own tortillas in front of you, or at least in sight from where we were sitting. 

It was difficult deciding what to order, the food looked and smelt great. So we all order a drink gives and took a little more time to order. I have to point out that their bean dip is delicious! I like to feel out and try different items at a new place I haven't been before, so I went with a combination plate, which included 1 Chili Relleno, 2 Enchiladas, with rice and beans. I also added an El Pastor taco on the side. 

Once the food came out, everything looked very nice. I liked everything I had ordered, but the El Pastor taco was very memorable. The meat was very tender and juicy, fresh toppings, and nice in size. 

In conclusion, this place was very good! I had tried some of my coworkers food as well and definitely want to come back and order Good portions, great food, constant refills, and excellent service."}
{"text":"Really like the place. Friendly staff. Good size portions. Lots to choose from. Hubby likes the salsa and chips."}
{"text":"This place use to be reasonable for good authentic mexican food. My past 4 visits have been disappointing! The company seems to be getting greedier each time. The positions of rice have become very small and the food quality is bland. If you ask for a preparada the beer is $5.00 and u pay another $5.00 for the tomato juice, which is just ridiculous. I also asked for a small side of a spicier salsa, they said it would be $3.00! Seriously! Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Every time we visit Vegas, this place is a must!! They always exceed our expectations food and service wise. I highly recommend the green salsa chilaquiles and aquas frescas, but I'm certain anything on their menu is delicious. I have to rave about their consistently great service; they are attentive, friendly, and really make you feel like you're eating at home. Do yourself a favor and come eat here :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and margaritas!! Went with my whole family and had a great time. We ordered jalapeño margaritas, ceviche, and carne asada tacos. Everything was perfect. I highly recommend this place!!! The servers were very attentive and fast. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Where do I start.... the food is mouth watering, hands down the best MEXICAN food I e ever had! No matter what plate I decide on, it's always satisfying and uber delicious. It's a MUST aim my to-do list when we come to Vegas.  The service is always great! Thanks Jesus, you were splendid."}
{"text":"Authentic, local & loved by locals. Cadillac Margharita is a must-have here. We've been going back to this place every yr during the wsop since 2010"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times for work lunches. Great food and great service. I love their grilled chicken and the bean dip and salsa is delicious too."}
{"text":"Only 4 because we didn't get any service for more than 30min then when we did we just got our waters and 3 trays of chips and salsa later . When our dinner finally came we were full on those chips and salsa do to the long wait . On the other hand we had a visitor at out table and we did let know the waitress it wasn't a cucaracha but it was a cricket ! And who wants to see a cricket right on your table while you having dinner  the waiter said : oh it's just a cricket then left , aside from that , the food was good and mainly love this place because of all the Frida khalo decorations (I love Frida ) so that was what brought me to this place"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I just wanted a small quesadilla and the kids one was the most fitting but instead of going to ask if that would be possible, the waiter had to argue with me, to the point that I just chose not order anything. I just went ahead and waited for my group to order and eat, I was not hungry enough to eat a full plate. He could have just ask management and at least pretend. What happened to customer first? I worked at InNOut for +5yrs and I know what good customer service should be like."}
{"text":"Javier the server was really rude with an attitude. Have you got my order wrong and blamed me for his mistake. Javier got loud in the restaurant and wanted to argue about the mistake. Javier gave me a menu then he left. The gentleman brought me chips and salsa and I was almost through before I called Javier for help . Javier seemed preoccupied with the cooks, I understand Spanish perfectly and he talked about me as if I did the order wrong .. He knew he was wrong he tried to offer me chips . He did not even want exchange my order. Needless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant. Half of the servers are sitting there eating their food looking at you drinking having a good time while you're waiting to be served . I waited and I just left. After I told the cashier she acted like she didn't even care it's not the area it's the people in the restaurant that are not professional or have an understanding of English unless you speak very very slow . Again I will not go to this restaurant ever you cannot pay me to go to this restaurant because the staff are so rude."}
{"text":"i would like to start off to say that i had a good meal. but i went to the bar had two drinks.. i played 55.00 dollars and i was ready to pay for my food they charged me for my drinks i said why when i played 55.00 they gave me the receipt that \"was wrong\".. it said i sat down there at 6:24pm and i arrived at 5:18 pm...which was wrong because, i made it there at 6:35 i picked my daughter up then came over to eat for almost 45 minutes. to make a long story short i asked them to go over the cameras they said, \"they don't work\" management was rude and she did nothing to help me. not even go back on the receipts an clarify that i wasn't lying. im not please and i feel like this company is getting over on alot of people with \"gambling\".. its not about the food or the drinks it about how she gave me receipts that clearly showed i wasn't there at that time. nacy g. our waitress was amazing wonderful server!... management sucks!!!!  I WOULD LIKE FOR EVERYONE TO BE ADVISED THAT THEY ARE TAKING PEOPLES MONEY!! AND THEIR GAMBLING MACHINES ARE WRONG! AND BETTER MANAGEMENT! I WANT MY DAMN MONEY BACK HIGHLY UPSET AND I WANNA PUSH THIS FURTHER CAUSE THIS IS HIGHLY UPSETTING!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! 
Great food first time in vegas definitely recommend this place.
Place has authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"I didn't like that place or the food. The service was fine; I had ordered a chicken dish and didn't like it at all because it tasted like peanuts. The complimentary chips tasted like they are cooked in peanut oil too and the salsa wasn't appetizing it was very plain."}
{"text":"It was just kinda dull all the way around.

The service was so-so. The food was so-so.

We ordered cheese and jalapeño dip. It was as watery as soup and no sabor. It was sent back. The waiter didn't seem surprised when I handed it back to him.  
We all ordered combo plates. BF got 2 enchiladas with green sauce, they brought him red sauce. It was corrected quickly. Mom got the taco place and I had the flautas. Nothing stood out. 
I think the prices are too high for the quality and quantity you are given. 
The one thing that irked me was that they charged me $3 for a little cup of chili sauce, and I mean little. I asked them if they had spicy salsa cuz the stuff they served with the chips had no kick. So the waiter brought me a little cup of chili sauce. This isn't something I would be charged for in Los Angeles so it didn't even cross my mind to ask. I was surprised when I saw the $2.99 on the check, but I did ask for it so....... Lesson learned. 
The best part about this place was the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Here we go you guys:
Great food. Had the shredded beef chimichanga (pronounced Chimmy-CHANG-ga). Sarie had the pork carnitas (pronounced Car-knit-tuhs). Good. Good. Real good.
Started out with two-for-one Mojitos. They were as refreshing as skinny dipping in the fountain of youth. 
We went with a groupon of course, so we also had two house margaritas. I had mine frozen (like my heart). Sarie had hers on the rocks (like our marriage). All good.
This place gets crankin around 8 pm. So plan on a busy, eventful, loud experience. Which is exactly what we wanted. There was a birthday girl at the booth next to us. She was very pretty.They did the song and dance for her. 
Also, the little mariachi man with the guitar can break down one hell of a 'De Colores' if you're interested in that stuff. I am of course.
Skipped out on desserts. who can eat a flan after all that booze and chips and rice and beans? 
The BEAR can, that's who! That's why next time I'm rocking CDJ with the big Bear and we'll go all the way with that caramel custard you guys."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us as \"The Best Mexican Restaurant in the city!\" After a morning of antique and vintage hunting we were starving and were willing to give it a try...as long as they had something gluten free.  I have Celiac Disease, so if I eat anything with gluten I'll get very sick. At first when we saw where it was we were a little hesitant, it's not the best part of town, but I was with my father so I was okay with walking around the area. Boy, I'm glad I took a step outside my comfort box because I really love this hidden gem! We were greeted by a very friendly man. When I asked about gluten free options he said I could have the fajitas with corn tortillas. I LOVE how this place is decorated! It's very unique and authentic. They have a nice patio, so I bet when the weather is nice it's lovely to sit out there. The food was absolutely delicious! The chicken was very tender and juicy. For the price we paid we got TONS of food! The best part, I didn't get sick. Gluten free safe for me! Next time we are in town we definitely want to come back to Casa Don Juan!"}
{"text":"If I could give this minus stars, I would.  What a \"rip off\".  My dh and I are from El Paso, TX, (where they have REAL Mexican food!)   Ate here tonight.  Where to begin?  First off, we ordered margaritas at $15 a pop.  Watered down drool!  No flavor, and where was the Tequila?  Food was lukewarm.  I had cold tacos.  My dh had tasteless enchiladas.  Friends had cold flautas and chile rellenos. It all tasted like 1960s TV dinners.  And, it was expensive!  $13.99 for two tacos and a dollop of canned re-fried beans and rice!  Save your money and eat at Taco Bell....It's better!"}
{"text":"Definitely a do-over. We've been driving past Casa Don Juan for a decade saying, \"we really need to try this place\". We finally did and we will be back. This place is surprisingly large inside with tons of character/personality. The menu is huge and everything we tried was excellent. They have a large staff so everything moves quickly and you get your drinks and chips/salsa/bean dip right away. Just a couple of blocks south of Fremont Street on Main this is a great place to stop for dinner before heading to Fremont for a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Horrible place. We purchased a groupn to use and they would not accept it. Their food was average at best and their service was below average. They would not even apologize about the groupon. Their are much better places to eat closer to the strip."}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time as it's literally down the street from my high rise. If you wanted to satisfy your Mexican cravings, Casa Don Juan was the place to be. However, lately the food has been gross and \"un-authentic\". As we sat, the chips were cold and stale, the salsa and refried beans also cold, lumpy and watery. Strike one. Next came out entrees. Within 10 minutes after place our order (literally 10 minutes), our food came. Here comes strike two: tacos looked as if some through a bunch of ingredients together in a tortilla, fried it with enough grease to take a shower with but yet also cold. Beans were flat and mushy, rice cold and stuck together. I mean, seriously? Complete half-ass food. How do you mess something like this up?

Clearly, just because you have traditional Mexican decor, have traditional Mexican music and your menu in Spanish, does not make you an \"authentic\" Mexican restaurant.

In the end, I will not be coming back here. I'd rather drive the extra mile or so to El Dorado Cantina."}
{"text":"I've been to Casa Don Juan at least a dozen times, and I've never had a bad meal. And I've never had to wait more than a half hour for it. (And that's pushing it.) This place is fast! And delicious!

When I moved here from Texas 16 years ago, I wanted to find a great Mexican restaurant. But everything was on the California-Mexican side of things (lots of cilantro, mango, and crap like that). And then I found Casa Don Juan. I'm not saying this place is true Tex-Mex, but it sure is good. It's my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, and that's saying something.

From the homey bean dip they give you with your chips to the homemade tortillas, this place is legit. And they sure love them some Frida Kahlo. (Look around; you'll see what I mean.) But on to the food...

As I said, I've been here a lot and usually get the traditional fare (tacos, burritos, chile rellenos). Tonight the spouse and I decided to try something different: he got the tongue, and I got the chicken mole. I'm not a big fan of organ meat, but I liked the tomatilla sauce on my husband's tongue (THAT sounds wrong!), and the important thing is that he loved it. My mole was delicious; one of the best sauces I've had.

Our waiter was great, and it was nice that we could use a Groupon for most of the meal. Even without a coupon, I would (and will) come back to Casa Don Juan. I've had their fish and chilaquiles, but there's still plenty of other menu options I need to try!"}
{"text":"Where do I start...
Upon entering the restaurant we were excited based the reviews and more excited after seeing  tres leces cake ...triple chocolate cake etc etc ...it was birthday dinner...
We were seated and served hard recycled tortilla chips and bland salsa...the margaritas were the worst that I've EVER had....
I LOVE authentic Mexican food...this was not a good start...

The server had the personality of a piece of sandpaper
My food was ok...you can't mess up quesadillas....
But when you use old and or recycled meat for carnitas 
No Bueno!!!
I told my server about it being my wife's birthday...TWICE...IN SPANISH...he never acknowledged if he even heard what was said.
We were not offered desert or even a second beverage....
We tipped him 20% knowing that we would NEVER return...
As we walked towards the exit passing several employees not a word was said.....NOTHING
Maybe the worse dining experience I've ever had"}
{"text":"Out of this world delicious! The chips and bean dip were incredible.  They make fresh tortillas and you see them do it. The Chimichunga was huge and so freaking good. Have a snack tomorrow. Oh and I forgot about the Pina Coladas in a pineapple. Going back in May!!"}
{"text":"Good food, lots of options, fast friendly service.  I've been there with large parties and for date night and have good experiences with various size parties.  I've also used groupons there successfully.  The whole fish is excellent!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant hand made tortillas... Great food and awesome friendly staff... They were quick and attentive ..."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years.. this restaurant hands down is one of the best in Vegas for Mexican food..  Well if its good enough for the Vice president of the united states..  LOL..  some of my favorite moments have happened in this restaurant to meeting a online friend for the first time to me and the fiance getting our moms together for the first time.  The food never disappoints and the drinks are to die for.. Guacamole hands down is the best in town.  TY Casa Don Juan for the many memories and great food.. hope for many years to come.."}
{"text":"Great downtown Mexican cantina, we went. @ peak lunch time & service was spot on. Food excellent & we highly recommend. Only temporary inconvenience is parking during the slow Las Vegas construction."}
{"text":"First time here and I will definitely be back! They make their own homemade tortillas!!!! I had the flour tortillas; delicious! I haven't found another place in Vegas that does this. You also get a side of complimentary bean dip with your chips and salsa which is a nice bonus. The house margarita is delish on the rocks!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant that serves fresh, full of flavor, authentic food! Guacamole and tortillas are made right there. The service was friendly. Highly recommend! The restaurant is off the main strip but well worth of going there"}
{"text":"If you Really like Mexican food at a reasonable price then look no further. The food was excellent and the wait staff was very attentive. Is on my go to dining list for every Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service! Try Juan's specialty margarita! The food is mediocre at best. I just wish the food was parallel to the service. Then I can give it 5 stars. Don Juan didn't leave a good first impression so I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Soooooo yes for the past few years I had the dreaded one star on this place because my mom got fish taco food poisoning....see my prior irate review. 

Times have changed and I decided to make a phone call and ask a few questions. 

Hubs and I decided to go have burritos after I found out their beans and rice do not have animals products in them......we got in the car and went......very glad we did!

We are now officially addicted to the Vegetarian burrito minus cheese and sour cream, their bomb salsa and their guac!!!!! 

GET IN MY BELLY BIG BURRITO, just kidding only half the burrito get in mai belly because you are too big. (?that's what she said?)"}
{"text":"The first time my boyfriend took me here I ordered the steak quesedillas, which I was not very fond of. However, as this is his favorite restaurant, we came back a few weeks later.

I ordered the chicken taquitos. They were delicious. The rice and guacamole that came with them were to die for. I also ordered a strawberry daiquiri, served with whip cream. Also very good. 

The service is quick and friendly. Don Carlos is a great server. SUPER friendly & quick. We now come here a few times a month. This restaurant is amazing."}
{"text":"Today my mom, sisters, and I wanted to have a girls day. We planned on shopping and getting lunch at Casa Don Juan. I parked in a lot. The spot I picked did not have any signs, but I didn't think much of it because we were planning on eating there. I was gone for no more than 15 mins waiting for my family to arrive and as I walked back I saw that my car was being towed. I walked up the man with my younger sister. We tried to figure out what was happening, he said to release it, it would cost me over $200. I was really upset but I wanted to go inside the restaurant and talk to somebody to clear things up. I walked up to the hostess and I told her how my car was being towed and she quickly and kindly said she would get a manager right away. The manger who was talking on the phone to who I assume was a customer, hangs up and the hostess tried to tell her the situation in Spanish. The manager just shrugged her shoulder at her. I'm pretty sure they didn't know that I spoke Spanish, I tried to explain the situation and she was just being so rude. I asked to go talk to the man and would not hear me out. I even tried to tell her the spot did not have any signs and how I felt that it was unfair. She started yelling and asked me to leave, which I did. When my other sister and mom arrived, we paid the towing fine and they went inside to eat. I was still very upset about the managers respond, but still came in later. One of my sisters told me how they were talking about me in Spanish and pointing fingers as I was walking in. We ordered drinks from Angelica R., who was really friendly, and an appetizer but felt so uncomfortable we decided to leave. As we walked out I asked for the managers name and she mumbled it and said something under her breath. I asked her if she said something and quickly and rudely responded. She told me in front of my sisters and mother and other customers, \"You come in and only have water. Ok, bye! Bye! Bye!\" It was humiliating, disrespectful and  completely uncalled for. I feel that I deserve an apology."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon and thought I would give this a shot.  The beans and rice were fine but the meat seemed to be of a low quality.  I will not go back and wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Best food since we have been in Vegas. Good prices, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this little gem in the art / antique area of downtown just off the strip.
The food and decor were great, but our waiter was very good and always there when we needed him.
We had a great lunch and even got our picture taken for free while we were there.  This is a fun, vibrant, yet relaxing little Mexican food place which I hope to return again some day soon"}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar, waiting for the rest of my party, was the best thing to happen yet! 

The bartenders were friendly, helpful, and busted their butts! The drinks were made fresh and they even refilled our drinks with the leftovers from our mixers. Also, while enjoying our drinks, I noticed they kept making fresh lemonade as it was ordered.

The entire staff were very friendly and flirty, too. I guess whatever it takes to make a buck BUT at least they treat you well.

I'll be back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Best dam chimichanga and enchiladas in downtown Las Vegas!!!great customer service . Sat at the bar had a great time .."}
{"text":"I love this place! The atmosphere is fun, the drinks are yummy and the food is amazing! The caso blanco was awesome. I had the best chili rellano ever. Everything we had was great and the staff was beyond attentive. If you haven't been you need to go! I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"One of the few good restaurants in the Arts District. Have come here several times, and every time the food is wonderful, the drinks good, the service friendly, and the place gets more crowded than you'd think for Main St. They never gripe or charge for extra chips & salsa, and it's walkable from First Friday. 

Came here with a large party and they could only split the bill in thirds, which would have been fine, had they kept it clean. Instead drinks from one table got put on another table's bill and it was a bit of a mess. Fortunately everything worked out easily. With a cranky office crew, that could have been a mess.

Has a small parking lot behind the building. Street parking also available."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Mojito in Las Vegas. Only if made by Enrique, actually from Cuba! Chips, bean dip, and salsa for free.

Top notch quality."}
{"text":"Been going here for 5ys...went recently...Refused to Accept a $15 off Coupon from the Entertainment book.....wont be back.....business must be great...good luck with the second location"}
{"text":"Chiliquilles and Mole are amazing! Been several times and never disappointed in the food. If you want solid authentic Mexican it's a Vegas must! P"}
{"text":"Jesus is the bomb manager was great food was excellent will be back again no wait time!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food, service was amazing (Thank you Hector!!!) we had sooo much fun. This restaurant came highly recommended and now we know why! We will be back."}
{"text":"Get the queso dip with chips  when you roll in.... It's great!"}
{"text":"Daaaaayum. Chicken tacos are fire! Carnitas plate amazing, salsa is great.would recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"This is of the best Mexican restaurants around. The chimichanga was authentic Mexican, and the flautas were just as delicious. Their salsa had a nice bite to it without being too spicy. Good customer service, too."}
{"text":"Wow. This place...is super good. Sometimes you just have to get a little off the strip to taste really good (and cheap!) food. Now first off, I'm from California..so the access to Mexican food is easy, but even with all the good places i've been to in L.A. and San Diego, I was blown away. It's a must to visit this place every time I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and both times I received great service. The food is delicious I recommend the jalapeño cheese dip! Ivan was our waiter today and he was very attentive and friendly. The food was served very fast even though there was a lot of people."}
{"text":"AWESOME place to have mexican in Las Vegas.  Situated between the Strip and Fremont St., this huge restaurant is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.   I love their margaritas, the streak is always tasty, I love their bean dip and chips and sauces and salsa. The staff is attentive and patient(i come with my 95 year old uncle)  Really great place to eat!  Plenty of handicap an street parking."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant I ever went to! 
THE want to be called managers is the worst customer service you can ever have.
It makes you want to close the restaurants!! F rating!!!!"}
{"text":"I give them a 5 star because they deserve it. Been here many times throughout the last few years, and continue to come back. There is a lot of construction on main st., which can make it a little difficult to park, but there is side street parking with less than a minute walk. Safe, clean restaurant with amazing food and excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"The tamales are very good but small ! The service l feel was awesome except the couple we were with  messed up the order and the gentleman giving us our food started to argue instead of taking care of the problem . The manager took care of the issue and was excellent at his job . I would defiantly go back !!!"}
{"text":"my fave mexican restaurant in las vegas! the green chile verde is excellent, as are all the combo plates, and if you go for lunch, the specials are around 8 to 10 dollars, with rice and beans. i love, love , love all the frida artwork, as she is my favorite mexican artist, and they have tons of her paintings and portraits on the large wall.
this is an excellent choice for locals, as well as tourists, as the food is really deleciousio!!!always my first pick for mexican food!!! the mariscos are  great too!!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!  I was a little nervous because I am pretty picky about my Mexican food -- but this was great!

The service was fantastic.  Their salsa was amazing -- one of he best I've ever had.  It kind of tasters like it had a few tomatillas thrown in too.  It tasted extremely fresh, like they just made it.

I will definitely go back next time I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Very nice people very nice food. It could be enough but I feel compeled to express my support for CassaDon Juan in few more words than that. Extremely big and tasty meals, very fast service, attentive waitress etc. seems to be standard there. We lived in Vegas at Stratosphere and were little unsure during our walk there - neighbourhood is not among the most pretty in the city, you walk past several used cars joints and repair shops, the street lights were off....but it all ended when we entered the Casa. The only thing I would change (at least for this particular evening) was the guitarist - although he seemed pretty skilled, mood of his songs wasn't very encouraging. I thought his songs should be more lively.

Go there and don't worry, you will fell well there."}
{"text":"We visited Casa Don Juan while visiting from the Bay Area, and we still talk about the tamales. They were amazing!

The overall experience was great: service was quick and courteous, I don't think our drinks ever went below half full.. Try the tamales!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The atmosphere is great. The food is delicious. The service is on point. You don't wait long to get your food. The only thing I don't like is the noise level, especially at lunch time. Besides the noise, I give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"I am slowly giving up on trying to find a good Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas thanks to more places like this one. Seeing the lady making fresh corn tortillas from the window looked like a good sign, but it takes more than a restaurant looking the part . 

I ordered the chicken mole and the dish had fajita style strips of chicken spread out to mimic a large plate of food, the mole had more oil seeping through than actual mole if you can call it that. The rice and beans were okay and ended up just eating that of my plate. One other bad sign was the deep fried fish being served to the table next to us and I will just say that fish is not suppose to smell like that raw or cooked, if the food didn't turn my stomach the smell of that fish did."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous comment: about not using the groupon! Tried it a few years ago and it was only ho-hum. Saw the groupon so figured at the price it was worth a date night try again. Service was great & Food was the same (see below) But they DID NOT HONOR THE GROUPON- all they did was take the price of the groupon OFF OF THE BILL!!!  (they took what we spent for the groupon & not the meals that it was supposed to cover. No discount given at all! ) We bought what we were supposed to, even double checked with the server...then bait and switch at bill time.  No savings here!

I wouldn't say amazing & I wouldn't say great. More like just good. Just good food. Staff was very friendly though. SAFE flavors for just about everyones taste buds. Tastes like it's all from a can or bag...infact, I found a 4 inch piece of plastic wrap in my cheese enchalada!!!!!

Not the best Mexican food in Vegas, but it's not the worst.  When you go into a Mexican resturant and full and it's all middle aged white people - that should tell you what you need to know;

Theres not much seasonings or variety in flavors, just staple 'expected' dishes that should be on a Mexican Resturants Menu.  Traditional combination plates (taco, burrito, enchalada, etc)  with a lot of cheese, not so much interest and tons of sauce to smother it. 

The \"jumbo\" margarita isn't.  Resturant is nice, clean and well decorated (except our table rocked a good 2 inches) and the staff was all very friendly.  Some confusion with the waiter though, I kept asking for two combination 31's. and he kept wanting to give me one combination 32....LOL.

There's so much better Mexican food in Vegas but I can see how this would be popular with the lunch work crowd. Those wanting the \"Denny's\" of Mexican food will love it. Those wanting something homemade and authentic will be disapointed. Even Robertos is better in flavor."}
{"text":"We found Casa Don Juan by accident looking for hangover food/drinks off of the Vegas strip.  We got very lucky landing here!  The chips/salsa/beans that come to the table free are so good, so was the bloody Mary and the pineapple pina colada.  

It has great outdoor seating which we sat at to enjoy the sun, inside the restaurant was pretty cold at the time.  My sister had the chicken fajitas and the portion size was huge, and she loved them.  I had a platter with pork tamales YUM! a beef taco that was ok and a fried pablano pepper stuffed with cheese also very good.  We ate everything and it did help cure the hangover.  Definitely tasted like authentic Mexican you can only get on the West coast."}
{"text":"Decorative with touches of Frida Kahlo, a homely feeling, and the chit-chat of many happy families and friends. Great place to walk into, off the bat!
Took a moment to be seated, but that's not too big of a deal to me. It was Saturday night you know.
I got a mix tostada, and it was absolutely delicious! So fresh and toppled with plenty of shrimp, octopus, and everything else. I was very happy with my dish. Date had a carnitas plate and it was pretty good as well, great portion and tender carnitas."}
{"text":"Margaritas, carnitas, rice, beans, and cheese dip amazing!!!!!  I will return to this restaurant for sure
Thanks Ivan our server"}
{"text":"The food is good at Casa Don Juan and we've been coming here for years but they have been incrementally raising prices, sky high for Mexican food in our opinion.  When we went on 8/3/13 the new menu had their meat quesadilla for $14.99.  That's crazy.  All of their other prices are very hight too.  Again, the food is good, but the value is terrible."}
{"text":"Came to this place last night for Our friends 40th Celebration ... Party of 10! We all could not stop talking about the Awesome Service from each and everyone of the friendly servers & the food was SOOO yummy:) We will definitely be back on our next Viva Las Vegas Vacay. Thanks Jesus"}
{"text":"Everytime we come to Las Vegas at least three times a year ! We head for Casa Don Juan! 
We love their quality and portions of their dishes!  the atmosphere!   the service! 
We have never experienced a bad meal or service!
The only negative thing is the road construction,  hopefully that's temporary!"}
{"text":"We came here twice on a recent work-trip to Vegas, and thoroughly enjoyed it each time. Really great staff: attentive, friendly, efficient. We came by after long work days both times, and appreciated being able to relax and be taken care of. Margaritas were good, salsa too. They made me a shrimp fajita quesadilla, even though it wasn't on the menu, and it was delicious. Guacamole was quite good. Others at the table had enchiladas, chicken mole, chicken quesadillas, and pretty much raved.  

We liked it a lot, and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Oh mylanta! There's not one time I go to Vegas without stopping here! I wish they opened another restaurant here in LA. The service is awesome, ambiance is great, && there is this super hot waiter working there now... WOW! Lol. Anyways... Haha. If you like to drink, i recommend the Modelo Micheladas, they're probably the best I've ever had!"}

{"text":"A-ok authentic Mexican place near the downtown area.

Location - not the best part of town. Parking is the worst especially during busy hours.

Restaurant - came here on a Saturday night and maybe something was wrong with the A/C that night but it was sooo hot! Add to that a crowded room and you've got yourself an oven! 

Service - fast and attentive enough considering how busy they were that night.

Food - we ordered the steak fajitas, wet burrito, and mango margaritas. Chips and salsa and bean dip are served before the main meals. Overall food was good! Definitely what you would expect from a Mexican place - greasy and unhealthy but very satisfying. I could've easily shared my fajitas, but since we had a Groupon, we went ahead and redeemed what it was good for. Margaritas were a bit strong. We didn't finish them. 

Overall- I would recommend this  for an authentic Mexican meal if you're on this side of town. I just hope in my next visit, they've got the a/c fixed by then."}
{"text":"Whew. Antiquing makes u thirsty. Couple o beers later... then shared Nachos... a bathroom.... what more can u ask! Food coma..! Lol"}
{"text":"A classic. I love this place always and forever. Jesus and Jerry were great tonight. Had my favorite huevos con chorizo. The guac is very fresh and atmosphere is fun and friendly. Free chips and beans."}
{"text":"We met some friends here on a Friday evening.  The restaurant isn't located in the best of areas but I felt ok during the sunlit hours.  The parking is also a little tricky.   The restaurant itself doesn't have much customer parking in the back.  The adjacent buildings have more spaces available for patrons.  

We were able to get a booth right away.  Soon after complimentary chips with salsa and bean dip are brought to the table.  The bean dip was very bland as though they opened a can of refried beans without mixing any cheese or spices to make it a 'dip'.  

For my entree I chose the #23 Carne Asada Plate.  This comes with the Meat, Small cheese enchilada and rice & beans.  I wasn't wowed by any means.  It was all just average for me.  

If friends want to come here I wouldn't mind. I would hope to find another dish that that would peak my interest."}
{"text":"Again I am not usually a fan of Mexican but when I do crave it, I love this place. It is about as Mexicany as it gets.  I am not sure if it is authentic representation of Mexican restaurants or if it is a parody but either way its a lot of fun and the food is great."}
{"text":"Admittedly, the food and service are very good. I highly recommend ordering the queso dip when you are seated. That being said, I was greatly disappointed upon seeing the bill. TWELVE FLIPPING DOLLARS for a VIRGIN Piña Colada and another $3.50 for a Shirley Temple for our two young sons!!! Most places include a soda with entrées off the children's menu and they charge three - and - a - half bucks for a Sprite and a couple of cherries?? The waiter couldn't seem to understand my confusion when he explained that Casa Don Juan charges the full price for non-alcoholic drinks. How 'bout offering up that little nugget of info to a customer upon ordering, huh?!? The drink menu on the table conveniently doesn't list prices and the \"jumbo Margarita\" I ordered seemed to be a virgin drink as well. Needless to say, I felt taken advantage of tonight and, consequently, will no longer offer them my business. Adios, Señor Juan!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican restaurant found on Main Street food seems to be a little on the pricy side but they make up with Fantastic service. Will update with food critique."}
{"text":"Tows cars. Used to eat there several times a month because it was near the office. Since Yelp is about food, know that it  is decent but average and you have a lot of choices in this price range in the immediate area. Dona Maria's comes to mind. They towed our car last time we were there. Now we are done. 

Got several sorry's from the owner but that's not bringing the $225 in towing fees back. Park at your own risk."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Casa Don Juan. The food is always amazing and the customer service is always great! Our host today, Ivan, was very personable and gave us great service! Several thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is very delicious! I got camarones a la diabla and actually got more then 6 shrimps on my plate unlike Lindo Michoacan.. the staff is pretty cool manager actually helps his staff on assisting customers and the prices are reasonable... my favorite thing is as soon as I walked in its decorated like a typical Mexican person house I loved it"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Still could find something better. I ordered a shrip tostada and some pieces of shrip were still frozen. Although the waiter was very kind, always passing by to see if we needed anything."}
{"text":"Came In to meet a friend and walked out having a friend. Bartendor gave me great service, margaritas taste great. Food looked great will return with friends. wish I could have hip music. chips and beans are a plus."}
{"text":"I happen to like this place & before our office moved it used to be across the street, now it's a downtown adventure which I still like because I always discover new things. It's a casual place with lots of beautiful Freda art and it always seems to be busy. 
I am always on the hunt for great Mexican restaurants in Vegas & this one I would describe as filling & casual. Not the greatest but nowhere near the blandest either. It's cheap & comforting. The staff isn't my favorite so try to get a groupon before you come to get the best discount out there."}
{"text":"Casa Don Juan rocks!  Came here for a late lunch the other day and the food and service was excellent.  The mango margaritas were the perfect way to start the weekend early.  I ordered the chili relleno + cheese enchilada combo and couldn't have been happier.  The chili relleno was the best I ever had.  Super light and melted in your mouth.  Loved their enchilada sauce.  I'm putting the salsa and guacamole here in my top 5 and that's saying a lot since Mexican is my favorite food.  The service was tops and so was the food, yay!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best Mexican food I've ever had! I had the green chicken enchiladas with rice and beans, so good! The offer so many different plates. The customer service is excellent  also! Will definitely come back whenever I'm craving Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Descent Mexican food. Not bad but no so wonderful. Sorry was very friendly but painless slow. The place was empty in a Tuesday night but they would hold us a table with a reservation? They push alcoholic drinks... Careful....chicken fajitas were standard fare...chicken mole was a bit sub par but very edible. Friend got chili relleno but complained it tasted of fish? Oh well, we will skip this in the future, but the location is good & atmosphere is fun.... Good modern hipster music."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before and ordered stuff. I ordered a quesadilla with only sour cream no guacamole... and what does it come with guacamole... I'm allergic to this now I can't eat it cause it's touching my sour cream. Like am I really paying $17 for them to mess up my order and give me an allergic reaction. This can put me in the hospital. I'm pissed."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding! Didn't run into one unfriendly staff member or anyone who didn't acknowledge you when walking by. This Mexican restaurant is in my top 3 favorite food places of all time.The decoration is very authentic and the hostess was dressed so cute. I would travel all the way to Vegas for the food. 5 STARS all around, ask for Alfredo and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was good, service was amazing, and the pina colada came in a pineapple. I didn't like that the semi attentive waiter, which later I found out that he is the one who keeps the full tip. The service was amazing because the guys in the blue shirts in which I thought were the main waiters made it a great experience!!! They were very attentive and nice! I I did split the tip after asking if they share and finding out they didn't."}
{"text":"We go here a lot! It's a wonderful place to bring families, enjoy yummy food and hang out. The service is friendly and the margaritas are big & delicious! We highly recommend the homemade guacamole :) It can be pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely thee best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas! I have been coming here about 15years! Spectacular service and the food is authentic as it comes. I love that they have added the bar in the back and more tables out front where you can sit out past dark and enjoy the out doors!"}
{"text":"I have frequented this establishment many times, however I will NEVER RETURN HERE AGAIN after my experience today. 
I have never been so insulted in a restaurant/bar before!
My husband and I decided to grab a bite to eat at the bar while we played keno & blackjack, after finishing our meal we continued to gamble. 
In the middle of a hand my machine completely blacked out, the bartender was able to cash out my money & I moved over to sit on my husbands lap and play his machine with him. About 10 minutes later an employee comes up to us & says that the owner is extremely upset & offended that I was sitting on my husbands lap & that I must move immediately. I am totally shocked & insulted! 
We are not only sitting at the bar area but I am wearing sweat pants & an old t-shirt! Simply enjoying my husbands company while spending money I do not need to spend at this establishment, they neither comp drinks nor discount them for gambling.
I am so insulted being chastised as if I am exhibiting obnoxious behavior. Shame on this business. 
I informed the server that was sent over to tell us that I would never return to this establishment ever ever again, 5 minutes later a busser is sent over to inform us that the owner is \"truly\" sorry
If the apology was sincere the owner would have came to apologize in person since he/she took it upon him/herself to insult us personally. 
We are locals here in las vegas, working in the service industry & owning our own business we know what customer service is & the level of disrespect that was exhibited at this establishment is unacceptable to not only myself but to anyone in the las vegas area."}

{"text":"Working downtown, Casa Don Juan is sorta a staple in the lunch rotation. 
On 4-20-13, I was attending The Smith Center matinee, and decided to stop at Casa Don Juan for lunch before the show.
I was surprised to see how busy it was, but that never seems to effect the great service. 
The Gentleman who greets you at the door  (with the mustache) must have ESP. He is always ONE step ahead of whatever is going on.  He knows exactly what is going on, even before you know what you want. He walked us to our table, and shortly after that someone came over for our drink order.  
Our food came out quickly, and exactly as we ordered.  
Food always tastes great, and fast service.  
I think I will be dining at Casa Don Juan, more often!"}
{"text":"Alfredo is the coolest server at this place! The food was good as well, but the customer service he provided was impecable. He would crack jokes and make my father and I laugh every time he came to check on us. Ask for Alfredo next time you are there and your experience will be great!"}
{"text":"Hello vegans - Sorry but I don't really recommend this place. Most Mexican places have dishes that are easy to adapt for vegans. Not so true here. We had the burrito with no cheese or meat - it was a bit dull. The atmosphere is interesting and other family members had tacos and enjoyed it. The chips were ok and the salsa was tasty."}
{"text":"Very disappointing meal. The tacos and enchiladas I swear are smaller and smaller every time. The carnitas were sitting in a pool of grease. Gross!!!  And the pricing seems to rise. Ordered pico gallo and there's a $2.50  surcharge. Where nowhere on the menu does it state it's a surcharge. When brought to managers attentions manager was combative and no service oriented. Will NEVER visit again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place - service was excellent, food was delicious.  Will definitely be going on our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant.  Great food and even greater Margaritas, and the staff is super friendly and helpful.  There are only 2 down falls, they are a bit on the pricey side, 2 meals with 2 margaritas, $50 not including tip, and they are in a no so great part of town.  My best girlfriend and I walked from the north strip of Las Vegas Blvd. to here and though we had no troubles, we were approached by shady characters twice, and no I don't mean beggars.  Just keep your eyes open.  The trip is well worth the food, if you drive vs. walking you would probably have no problems what so ever."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time. About 2 years ago some change happened with the cooks or food they order, I don't know but it clearly was NOT as good as it was befor. Well one day I walk in there with my wife for a quick lunch on a Sunday and ordered a large  Menudo and i orderd enchiladas for my wife. We didn't finish all of the food because it wasn't that good. ( it just tastes like stereotypical fast Mexican food now)  When the waiter came and picked up the plates we did not complain but he asked us whether we liked the food or not because most of it was still on the plate. I told him I didn't like it and I have been eating there for years and to me it just wasn't as good as it used to be. I guess he goes and tells the owner's daughter who was the supervisor for the shift at that moment,  but she comes over tells us she is the owners daughter ..... she is the rudest person I have ever encountered. She told me I was wrong because EVERYBODY else was eating their food and nobody was complaining. I told her I wasn't trying to complain,  the waiter asked me why I didn't finish the food and I was honest I had been going there for four or five years at that point and do not plan on returning. The owners daughter is ghetto and come off as a spoiled brat. I did not need to know your DADDY owns the restaurant. But very well, I will never spend another dollar in that restaurant and will tell everyone I know not to eat the. That girl was so unbelievably rude. When I go and eat out at a restaurant if I don't like something I never complain. But this experience required a pretty long complaint on Yelp seeing how I felt as if she will scolding me and my wife in front of the rest of the customers and I was very embarrassed. It was just crazy, I didn't ask her for a replacement meal, I didn't ask for her to take it off the bill, I didn't ask for a refund but just because I didn't finish my food she felt the need to come over and tell me I was wrong for not liking the food. What is that? Save your money and go eat somewhere else where they know how to treat customers right. There are plenty of better Mexican Restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Once again, superior service, food was delicious, Fajitas hot hot.  they even remembered me from last time here,  salad in front of me before I could open my mouth.  I truly Love this place....."}
{"text":"As someone who is always on the hunt for amazing Mexican food in the valley, this place may have ended that search. 

Living in Tucson, AZ for the last 15ish years, I am VERY hard to satisfy when it comes to Mexican food. I love Casa Don Juan. The vibe, food, drinks and staff all make this place worth the trek downtown, for sure. 

As this place can be a bit busy, we usually grab a margarita at the bar while we wait for a table. Their margarita are great. They don't over-do it on the sweet. They are limey, strong and delish. I usually order the skinny, just because it is even less sweet than the House or Cadillac Margaritas. They also offer a variety of flavors, if that's your style.

The menu here is CRAZY huge, so I would be surprise if you couldn't find something here you loved. As is standard each type of food is split into sections, which eases the search for what you like. 

Everything I have tried here hasn't disappointed. The Chile Relleno, Shrimp tostadas, Veggie Fajitas, all so yummy. And, most importantly, their salsa, guac and beans do not PLAY. So yummy and spicy. If you are looking for Mexican food in Vegas (THAT ISN'T LINDO and is actually good) go here ASAP. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very bad experience here..sucks because I was really looking forward to it. To be fair the staff was great, food was not that good meaning it didn't have much flavor (maybe it was the chef that day..?) but management was very rude and made our family very uncomfortable when we asked to swap a dish that was incorrect. The manager was being defensive and loud it was awkward and nothing I have experienced before..especially when it was the waiter mistake (which we made no big deal about). I hope that manager is no longer there for everyones sake! This happened a few months ago but it still haunts me!!"}

{"text":"Possibly the worse service I have ever had. We were seated the young girl asked if we wanted to start with a guacamole dip we said yes, it never came. Had the server pass us more than a few times wouldn't even make eye contact. Finally get to order my husband orders their shrimp burrito I asked If it came with a good amount of shrimp if not to add extra (we didn't care to pay the extra price) he said that it was a good portion so we took his word. I ordered the cheese enchiladas which didn't taste too bad except the fact that they were cold. I asked for some tortillas on the side for my daughter he brought out the hardest tortillas ever! So hard my daughter choked on it. I guess the only good thing I can say is that our food came out fast. But I don't see how much time they needed to roll a few tortillas and smack them on a plate. (The burrito was literally the only thing on the plate) no sides no nothing. I will for sure never come back or recommend this place to anyone! Thanks for nothing. Besides a 60$ bill for bad everything!"}

{"text":"My wife and I dined at Casa Don Juan on Saturday, May 28, 2016 the food was so delicious we had to go back on Sunday for round two. I don't usually go out for Mexican food but Don Juan's food reminds me of my mother's home cooking. The food is not toned down in respect to spiciness and if you like spicier (hotter) food just ask the waiter and they will prepare it for you. The attention to service we received from our waiter Jose was superb. We highly recommend Casa Don Juan. For those visiting Las Vegas, you will not regret dining there. We have been dining at Don Juan's during our Las Vegas visits for the past 6 years.  Did I mention they have homemade flour and corn tortillas?"}
{"text":"Good food good people good service a great place to hang out and take your loved ones and relatives"}
{"text":"I was impressed with this place. I went there initially after their Groupon deal. The homemade chips and salsa are good. The staff is extremely friendly. They do have like 4 different people waiting on you, but you never are waiting long. I will be back."}
{"text":"The food is great! But the service is sub-par (super friendly, but SLOW), and it's a bit more pricey than it's worth (their prices have gone up in the last year). I will not be going back after tonight. My chimichanga was supposed to come with sour cream -- there was less than a tablespoon's worth on the plate, whereas there was probably 3-4 times as much guacamole on the plate. I'd expect a relatively equal amount of sour cream. I pointed this out to both the server and the server assistant and asked for a little bit more (and it took far too long to actually get more sour cream).

I got charged for the sour cream ($1.50), so I asked for it to be removed when I went to pay at the counter. The manager asked \"what was wrong with the sour cream\" and I repeated my complaint and said that I didn't ask for nor need the 1/2 cup of sour cream that they brought me. I just wanted what ought to have come with my dinner.

The manager ended up taking off 1/2 of the cost. So I still paid .75 cents. Now, I know it's that much money, and that wasn't the point of asking for it to be taken off. It's the principle of the thing. I paid $15.99 for a chimichanga that was supposed to come with beans, rice, guacamole, and sour cream. I don't think it's too much to ask to get more than a micro-dollop of sour cream. Had my meal not come with sour cream, I would have ordered it and happily paid the $1.50.

I was not expecting an attitude from the manager over $1.50, especially when I had a $95 bill. (If I was going to complain and lie about something, I would have complained about something worth more money.) What's more, when a server came up to the counter (not my server), she asked him in Spanish if he'd \"served that girl sour cream.\" Like I was lying or something? (And like this white girl can't possibly understand Spanish.) I rarely ask for a bill adjustment, having been a server for so many years, but I've never gotten a rude pushback like this before over a measly buck fifty. To me, that says a lot about how they do business, and I for one don't appreciate it. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Place was cracking. Thanks the lord i knew gabby (ask for her!) behind the bar. She walked me straight to the chips, guac, salsa and more. Place is money!"}
{"text":"In my experience Mexican fare in Las Vegas is pretty much the same.  This restaurant has recipes more like those in Albuquerque."}
{"text":"We always make a stop here when In Vegas for authentic Mexican food. Service is mediocre, waiters always seem to be the same...not very happy. They have a pretty large menu and options for vegetarians, including vegetarian beans. They give you chips, salsa and warm bean dip free of charge but if you want the hot salsa, there is a charge. They have hand made tortillas (flour and corn)...a lady is making them in a corner for you to see if you want...they are yummy! Pretty good place to eat."}
{"text":"The original of what is now 3 locations Casa Don Juan is a staple of traditional Mexican food and one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. I think there are other really good Mexican places in town, but they can be inconsistent. I've always had quality experiences here and have yet to try something I don't like.

I really enjoy the Puerco En Chili Verde, the Super Burrito, Chicken Enchiladas, and Bistec Ranchero.  But have tried most of the menu and everything has been great. 

The price point is great too. For the amount of food it's hard to beat. The Puerco en Chili Verde is $12.99 and comes with a solid portion of pork onions and tomatoes in a spicy chili verde sauce, tortillas, a heaping side of rice and beans. 

They often have a Groupon for two entrees and two margaritas which is clutch, because you definitely want a margarita. They are massive and delicious."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. I always get a cheese enchilada with rice. While we were in Vegas this past weekend, we all wanted Mexican food and were going to go to Carlos and Charlie's at the Flamingo but thought it probably wouldn't be the best place for authentic Mexican. We were just about to pull out of valet parking at the Flamingo when one of the valet girls offered to give us a few suggestions for alternative Mexican places. She suggested Casa Don Juan or Ciscos (Sisqos? sp?). We went with CDJ.
My cheese enchilada had zero flavor, and the rice was basically the same. The enchiladas were ridiculously spicy, but spicy doesn't matter if there is no flavor behind it. My grandma got the chili relleno (which she gets at all Mex restos) and she didn't like the looks of it. It was soaked in grease and so much cheese you couldn't see if there was even a chili in there. She took one bite, waited a few minutes, and then felt sick. Not good. My grandpa got the bacon wrapped shrimp  and said it was alright but had no flavor, either. 
Chips and salsa were not memorable at all.
Staff was friendly, but that didn't make up for the bland/overly greasy food.

Cheese enchiladas 2/10
Rice 2/10
Chips and salsa 3/10"}

{"text":"I went on a Sunday night after seeing a performance at The awesome Smith Center. Six of us, all long time locals, and frequent foodies! (We try everywhere!) Three of us ordered items that come with tortillas (2 Fajitas and 1 Mole). The portions are very generous but tasted only OK. However, that wasn't really a big deal. We were enjoying the atmosphere, service and the company of friends & family. The problem occurred when the bill came and there was a random charge of $3.50 for tortillas. Hmmm. Where did that come from? I inquired? Apparently, after a rude explanation from an unfriendly woman employee, we were advised that it was because we ordered extras tortillas to go with our food. So, let's recount...I ordered fajitas. I have been ordering and eating fajitas for a long time. I always make 4. The other order of fajitas needed 4, and the one who ordered Mole ever even got hers. We explained this, but to no avail. Their ratio is that you get 2 flour tortillas or 3 corn tortillas with each order. Really? Really? And, IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUCH AN AFFRONT IF IT WAS JUST STATED ON THE MENU OR STATED BY ANY OF THE 4-5 EMPLOYEES WAITING ON US. No one ever mentioned an extra charge, but we are supposed to, either know this by osmosis, or, know that the \"tortilla lady works very hard\" (according to the unpleasant female who spoke with us) and as if we have no respect for the tortilla making art! Ha! We left feeling very unhappy and felt that they chose to alienate us from ever returning due to what should be an easy communication with customers. Seemed like a scam, looked like a scam, definitely was a scam."}

Es sin duda el mejor restaurante de Comida mexicana en el que he comido, puedes disfrutar desde un delicioso desayuno hasta una cena formidable por un precio bastante razonable.
Me encanta el lugar y el homenaje que hacen a Frida Kahlo llenando sus paredes con valiosas pinturas y retratos de nuestra querida Frida. Quien sin duda es la mejor pintora mexicana de todos los tiempos a quien respetamos no solo por su trabajo si no por su gran valentía y aportaciones a la literatura mexicana. Hago énfasis en este espacio que dedica el restaurant a Frida porque si bien fue algo que amé desde que lo vi también hubo que reproché inmediatamente, utilizan la imagen de Frida Kahlo como mantel individual, es decir te sirven la comida encima de la imagen de Frida y obviamente los clientes la ensucian mientras comen! Lo considero IRRESPETUOSO e insultante para la cultura mexicana. Me sentí muy triste cuando vi la imagen de Frida maltrata y sucia por los desechos de comida en ese mantel. Trataré de hacerles llegar este mensaje personalmente porque me encantó el lugar sin embargo no puedo regresar y apreciar ese escenario."}

{"text":"WARNING:
THE GUACAMOLE DIP THEY GIVE U WITH UR CHIPS IS NOT FREE. YOU'L GET CHARGED FOR IT EVEN WHEN U DIDN'T ORDER IT.

Was in Vegas and found good reviews so my friend and I thought this would be a gr8 way to end our trip b4 we left...WRONG
BECAUSE
The manager is the rudest person I have ever encountered... in my life. 
He was all smiles when we first arrived, he seated us at our table. Then the waiter brought chips, salsa, and guacamole dip to our table and left. Complimentary RIGHT? All Mexican restaurants do this. We ordered our food, was alright. Got the bill and there was a $5 extra charge for guacamole dip WE NEVER ORDERED.
Of course I thought this was an honest mistake, I told the waiter who then said sometimes the manager forgets to ask the costumers if they want it. Let me get him.  What??/ we were never \"asked.\" We call the manager who saw people around us were getting curious so he intentionally raised his voice and said \"I know I asked you\" He never did AT ALL \"it's going to be $5\" and he was being adamant. He added insult to injury by remarking well next time now u know in a snark tone. This guy is a major JERK and a LIAR. It's not the $5 but it's the principle of the matter, the fact he straight out lied and then raised his tone when others were listening to make it seem like he was right. The ironic part of all is that we witnessed the same scenario happen a few tables from us. The party called the owner but this time he quietly disputed with them because there seemed to be a very angry man he was dealing with as they were about to leave. I'm connecting the dots, they probably also had an issue with the MANAGER adding something onto their TAB that they never ASKED for.
I thought I would end my Vegas trip with a bang by eating here but this guys nasty attitude caused us to leave our food. I couldn't stomach eating left overs
from such a shady place.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED"}
{"text":"NOT LGBT FRIENDLY......I guess they don't realize they are in the Arts District!!!

They did everything they possibly could to get us to leave without actually saying it...... It worked and we will never go back!  

Honest opinion of food....below average however it is a nice atmosphere. 

Don't buy a Groupon, they don't honor them. They give a lame excuse about how it is a misprint. They did reluctantly honor ours, up to $10.99 apparently means anything over $10.99. Explain that logic! Groupon states 2 lunch items up to $10.99 for $13. They said what I really means is spend over $10.99 for each item and we will honor the groipon......thus making it a $9 coupon. If you spend over $22..... 

Rude rude rude"}

{"text":"I was in Vegas for the week end with a group of friends. 

After a few disappointments with other restaurants, a friend recommended this restaurant place is nice and bright, the service is fast and the food, oh the food, is just right on. 


What a great experience we had in this place. First of it was Monday morning, most of us hungover (really hungover) It was a group of 12 with out resevations, and they had no problem seating us in a few mins. i thank them for that.

I had the puerco en salsa verde (pork in green sauce), the meat was tender, the sauce was spicy but not overwhelming, rice and beans were good.. Other people in my group had different dishes and I got to try a couple of them. The carnitas was really good. camarones a la diabla, just good. Guacamole is really good too. 

The drinks were great. 

I wish we had known about this place from the beginning and maybe we would have come here everyday. 

Casa Don Juan, good service, nice place and excellent food."}
{"text":"1st time coming to casa don juan, service was great fast seating same with our drinks and food they came out quickly love their chip and salsa with fried beans. My husband order choriqueso as an appetizer it was really good it comes with tortilla of your choice flour or corn the only down side is it comes with only 2 pieces of tortilla for a big portion of choriqueso had to order more tortilla. I ordered the chicken enchilada for my son it came with rice and beans it had a very good flavor the bad part was the rice it was very dry. I ordered the mix cocktail (octopus and shrimp) i was not impressed with my order it needed more flavor and my avocado was black. My husband ordered the carne asada plate we think the portion was not right por the price. So he had to order 2 shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"The fajitas here are great! I ordered a steak - shrimp combo and trust me, they don't skimp out on the meat here. Next time I could easily share this entree. I went with my boyfriend and his 2 and 4 year old kids after a day of swimming at the golden nugget pool. The kids were totally wiped out and wanted something simple. So, luckily for us they had \"american\" options of chicken nuggets and fries, their favorite! My margarita was delicious, gigantic, and topped with gran marnier! perfect. My boyfriend ordered chicken enchiladas and I loved the sauce on it. The next time I went back I ordered a taco and tamale, but I'll be sticking with fajitas from now on, they were the best."}
{"text":"Casa Don Juan offers a pretty standard Tex-Mex menu -- burritos, enchiladas, tacos, etc.  And they do a good job with the standards, so they're starting out with 3 stars.  Why 3 stars already?  Because Mexican food is awesome.  And you will get a pretty good version of whatever Mexican dish you order from here.  Not life-changing, but good, Tex-Mex comfort food.  

The extra star comes from the restaurant's staff.  I've been there for lunch a few times and in the evening during First Friday events once or twice.  Each time I've been there, the wait staff is friendly and outgoing.  Talking to them generally brightens my day (I work downtown, I need brightening).  Even in the middle of a lunch rush, they are very attentive (last time I was there, they refilled my iced tea so many times that I almost burst).

And if you go at lunch, the owners are often around checking in with tables to make sure everything was good. Hey, family-owned places are becoming rarer in Vegas.  I'm a fan of comfort food done well and great customer service.  Check and check."}
{"text":"Easily found parking out front. Always seems to be cars all round, figured the place might be popular. Seated in a near empty restaurant in the back by bar. Waiter came over every few minutes to ask if I was ready to order- with menu open. The food came in about 4 mins after I ordered. Just an assembly line I guess. Margaritas were mostly the pre-mixed sweet and sour. Man took away chips and plate before we were done. The push to turn over the table was keenly felt. The tamale was tender, chips store bought, table salsa ok. Beans were good, but it all needed a lot of heat. Did not feel like a $30 dinner."}
{"text":"Great food even better service!

I had the torta i always get it everywhere i go and theirs was very good they had a lot of meat packed in it and it is $8 but that's how much tortas are everywhere now a days, i come from california i've had many and cannot recommend it enough

Decoration is awesome even their bar packed with tequila 

As for parking i recommend taking a left turn 1 street before arriving on your GPS because it does make it difficult to come back around"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I rarely leave negative reviews for restaurants, let alone rate them 1 star, but I feel that I need to share my experience at Casa Don Juan.

I've visited Casa Don Juan several times. I usually order a margarita and chips and dip, because their food has never seemed too appetizing or authentic to begin with.  After my last visit, I will NEVER return, not even if I am thirsty. 

I ordered a fish ceviche tostada and was served FROZEN, actually, Frostbit, shredded tilapia on a tortilla shell.  As soon as I saw it, I questioned the waiter on what kind of fish they used for their ceviche as well as how they prepared it.  The waiter did not know, so I waited, and waited for an answer.  After thirty minutes with no response, I inspected it and confirmed the fish was frozen.  I then personally walked the dish to the kitchen and questioned the cooks as to what I was being served.  They confirmed it was frozen fish with lime juice, but that they'd be happy to make me another one. Seriously? They offered a shrimp ceviche, to which I replied \"Is the shrimp frozen too?\", sort of jokingly.  They didn't lie and said that too was frozen shrimp with lime juice. But that they could go back and check that the shrimp was defrosted all the way!  \"NO, Thanks!\"   

This is definitely not authentic ceviche, which they should disclose, but that is not even what I am complaining about. These were not even chunks of fish, it was the scraps of frozen bits you find at a bottom of a bag of frozen fish.  Why would you serve that to your customers?  If you are out of something on the menu, your customers prefer you tell them you're all out and not being served scraps of frozen bits of fish.  Or maybe it always looks this way.  Is making $8 dollars on the sale worth it?

Needless to say, I highly recommend you DO NOT order ceviche, fish or shrimp, at Casa Don Juan.   I haven't had much else there, like I said before but this is one of those things that is unforgivable when it comes to food.  If I could rate zero stars, I would.

Also, I paid my bill 100%, because they still charged me for this food.  I was with my niece and nephew and they ordered burritos, and were charged and extra $1.50 for sour cream and another $1.50 for cheese, per burrito.  That's just ridiculous. The waiter said it would come out of his check if we did not pay for it when I started complaining, so I just paid for it as to not cause a scene.  What a joke!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Definitely a place that is known by the locals.  It's far from the strip and worth the trip....When u eat the chips u r already pulled n...When u taste the Frijoles that come with the chips u ' re thinking,  okay, I really like this. ..order the guacamole and fall in love...it's creamy and immensely flavorful.  It was lunch so I ordered a shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada. ..I don't know how to describe it but every morsel of that taco was tantalizing!  The Cadillac margarita was smooth. ...AND the had the US Open on the big screen!   Honey,  I'm home!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican place in the city!!! The tortillas are handmade, the Carne Asada is perfect, and the service is super fast and friendly. There's no where better!"}
{"text":"This the \"Sunday\" stop. Great food, great service, friendly help, and a very clean place. I have seen families enjoy themselves and very large parties. 
Bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"After a day of hiking, Mexican cuisine seemed right on time.  This establishment had some overall decent reviews. My take on this restaurant: Don't order a pitcher of margaritas unless you prefer your drinks watered down  :-(   Complimentary tortilla chips were mediocre, although Salsa/guacamole and bean dip were pretty good.  Streak/shrimp and tamale/taco/enchilada combo pretty good - would give that a 3-4 star rating.."}
{"text":"Top notch Mexican food in Las Vegas. It's well worth your time to go downtown and look this place up. Great food at a great price. The guacamole is a must!! The service is great too!! My opinion it's the best of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"my family has been going to this restaurant for over 10 years and have enjoyed the success that the place has experienced. Yes, its busier and more americanized but the quality of the food is still great"}
{"text":"Could have had better service they over charged me after buying a groupon it was the dinner one that came with 2 large margaritas and they charged me for one at the end of the bill and when my boyfriend tried showing them it was included they practically laughed at him and still charged him."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place with a friend and a Groupon a few years ago. It was pretty good, service was horrible. But the food was good enough to give it a second try, it's become a downtown favorite and a place I take people from out of town. I've never had anything bad here and the service (on the inside) is great. Mistake was eating outside the first time....the outside seats don't seem to ever be used anymore...perhaps because they forgot about the people out there. Great for large parties too."}
{"text":"Casa don Juan is one of my longtime favorite spots. The Lengua tacos are always consistently delicious and entirely craveable. This is a great casual sit down Mexican restaurant great for pre or post First Friday munchies.

The frozen margaritas aren't exactly strong, but they aren't overly sweet either. The atmosphere is warm, exciting, and inviting. It's like Grandma's House in Mexico. Great smiling service, and you can pay at the table or on your way out."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Stratosphere a couple years ago and we wanted some Mexican food. But we wanted a nicer then your average hole in the wall and by chance as we exited the freeway on the way to our hotel we came across CASA DON JUAN!!!
Pricey but the food is delicious!!
Now everytime were in Vegas we dine here and have yet to be disappointed...
I've only given 4 stars because we haven't tried everything on the menu, yet lol"}
{"text":"Close to Downtown...the food is good, service is fast, price is right! Can't go wrong with the Carnitas here!"}
{"text":"We came with a Groupon.  The place was packed, which tells you something considering it was downtown in the arts district, there was road construction in front, and parking can be a bit of a challenge in that area.  We had a 20 minute wait in a comfortable seating area on a Saturday night, without a reservation.    
Pros and Cons: Service was friendly, efficient and excellent without being overly intrusive.  Food came fast and was hot and good.  The margaritas were strong and delicious, however they did not offer a frozen margarita, which is our preference.  The large menu is in both Spanish and English and does offer some vegetarian options including a vegetarian burrito but I'm not certain  whether they use animal lard in the dishes without meat so if you are vegetarian you may want to inquire.  I didn't see anything to address gluten-free concerns.  The atmosphere is family dining but there wasn't entertainment, so while it's festive and pleasant, I'm not sure this is a destination for special occasions such as birthdays.  They offer little bags of chips and treats for purchase on the way out, which is a nice touch.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is soo awesome! The food was delicious and the service was fast! Friendly staff too:) I ordered the pollo en mole. It comes with beans and rice and tortillas.  Is was the bomb! Affordable price. I found a new spot to come to satisfy my mole cravings:) I'll be back! !"}
{"text":"I love this place! I love everything from the Frida Kahlo theme, to the fabulous food, to the excellent staff, to the incredible cocktails! Their top shelf liquor selection. Is very impressive and not limited to just tequilas!"}
{"text":"Gabby and Kiki always have such amazing service, green chili pork is bomb.com, forever one of my favorite places in the city."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken enchilada and the chille relleno. Enchilada was good but the chille relleno was lacking \"something\" but wasn't sure what. Maybe I'm just used to the relleno in SoCal. Without the chille relleno, food was great."}
{"text":"Wow!!! what an experience. Aside from their AC not working at 117 degrees outdoors,asking to be placed at a different table because the heat was unbearable, our server Jesus B.  was trying to pocket $100 our friend payed without letting us know. Our friend was the first to leave so we watched him as he payed his food on his way out. Little did we know he was being generous and payed more than what he consumed. Once the bill arrived I reviewed it but his food was still being charged on it. We waited for Jesus to come back around to our table and when he finally did I questioned him about the money that was given him to cover part of the bill. He would have never told us money was payed to him at this point if we hadn't seen it all. he proceeded to tell us he only payed $80 and to go ahead and just pay what was left on a bill of $186. So, to leave $100 dollars. REALLY !!! I call my friend to confirm the amount that was payed and he said $100. At this point he turned a million colors not expecting us to call and confirm. We then were pretty fed up and offended at his shady service so we left $80 on the table and we explained why, his only response was \"oh Ok, thats fine, and we all walked out. He never came out trying to collect the $6 we were short on. He must have did something wrong."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 10 plus years.............the rice & beans remind so much of my Nana's, brings back great memories of my childhood."}
{"text":"Every time we come to Las Vegas we come to this restaurant, the food is delicious and authentic! The staff are courteous and attentive, music is delightful!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing. The food the atmosphere and customer service. We come every time we come to vegas. The pozole is delicious better than any in LA. \"Yes I said it, I'm from Pico Rivera  so yes I can say this\" if you haven't tried it yet it is a must."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in Las Vegas. Every time we came to Vegas we make sure to eat at Casa Don Juan. Staff is extremely nice."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Been going there for years with coworkers and friends. Decided to take the family. We were a large group. Food was good but it took an hour to get it and it came out warm (maybe) so disappointed."}
{"text":"So my fiance and I came here really early they open at 7am got to come in a little early they saw us at the for opened them up very nice people.) We were just going to wait the extra minutes) 
Hot or drinks,chips salsa, bean dip so fast ordered at first I thought it was a bit pricey but as soon as our orders came out oh my goodness I knew why they give you a great deal amount for what you pay so it's great not to mention their staff is on it you need something they will get it for you to make you comfortable
Will be coming here again"}
{"text":"While the food was good, they seemed very annoyed that we had Groupons.  The server came over and we let her know and she immediately sighed and looked like we just ruined her night.  She said we'd have to speak with her manager about it so she went and got him.  He was pleasant about it and reiterated the exact rules of the Groupon so we would be aware.

The rest of the night the server seemed bothered by us which started to becoming annoying.  But the food was good, so we'll be heading back, hopefully with a Groupon to see if the server is still as annoyed! haha"}
{"text":"I know after 700 plus reviews....what else can someone add? Well here we go. LOL!! Apparently Casa Don Juan not only has ton of reviews but friend told me second oldest Mexican restaurant in Vegas. Really? I can tell you from the minute you open the door OMG not only does this place scream personality but the interior design is old school. Not even mentioning the fact the restaurant is located in downtown area that shady more so in the evening. They do have other business around and part of the whole revitalizing downtown scene. 

I came for early dinner with friends. It was my first time. Like mention before walk in the HH hour margarita menu board right outside next to the door screams personality. Not only from the day of the dead art on chalkboard but all the different flavor margaritas in different color. Once step foot inside there so much random stuff going on not sure what stood out more for me. The day of the dead characters on shelf, the history of Casa Don Juan, the photos, and even have zoltar but instead of your normal character you have Casa Don Juan herself. Kind of creepy. My opinion. They two separate dining areas and bar area (they have machines at the bar area). The waitstaff outfit got personality. 

The menu...swear by far one of the biggest menus seen in Mexican restaurant. It was like seven different pages. I had hard time figuring out should get the first time. Thankfully Yelp family pushing the fresh guacamole. We ordered that for appetizer or starter with the chips and salsa. The guacamole was awesome. It talked refreshing, fresh, the color tell used perfect ripe avocado nice green, and had nice seasonings. Definitely dish would recommend! My entree went with two tamales. Not often order tamales and not sure other Mexican restaurants if standard menu item. Whatever the case I got one chicken with green salsa and one pork with red sauce. The dish came with rice and beans. The tamales were amaZing. Everything was was point from the wrapping and once open it up jaw dropping. Nice hot, moist, and the fillings on both were hell of tasty and the sauce. I would say some of the best tamales every had in life. Each one was nice size. The rice and beans was solid. All the food is very reasonable price but honesty Mexican food not that expensive. The thing that stands out Casa Don Juan they say authentic Mexican food and it REALLY is authentic. They have lot of the traditional dishes that also on the menu. They also get best of las vegas awards. So 700 plus reviews and awards later Casa Don Juan Restaurant had truly stood the test of time. Happy that my friends suggested going here for dinner. 

The service was nothing but five stars. The hostess to our waiter they were on it the whole night."}
{"text":"There are authentic Mexican restaurants, and then there is Casa Don Juan, which serves the best chile relleno and enchilada combination ever created. The freshness of the homemade ingredients delights the senses and transports the diner to another world, long ago, before modern chemicals ruined the delicate flavors of fine food.  I ordered the chile verde, which was fantastic and on par with some of the best chili verde dishes I have enjoyed in California and Arizona."}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is amazing! The food is fantastic. Fresh, authentic! The mango margarita was perfect."}
{"text":"Always love this place..  Great service, price and atmosphere.. Guacamole is incredible."}
{"text":"this place was the worst I've had here in vegas, I had the machaca con huevos and found a hair in my food. the best they could do was say sorry, my michelada didn't taste right and my boyfriends coronita had to be made twice Cuz it had no flavor. the second one was ok but still had no flavor. I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food & very friendly staff! Highly recommend this place, especially coming from LA this place has amazing Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is a very hard rating for me to settle on. If Casa Don Juan was a bar without a food menu, I would give it 5 stars right now for the amazing pina coladas served inside a whole pineapple. I wonder how many cases of pineapples they must go through in a week. The flavor from having fresh pieces of pineapple blended inside the creamy, frozen beverage is just perfect. They also make fresh lemonade that is very good, along with other flavors of aguas frescas.

The food warrants a much lower rating. I enjoyed the chips and salsa, but nothing else tasted fresh. The cheese tamal was bland and dry, tasting like it had been frozen. The chile relleno was also strange, like a wet towel filled with a cheez-like mass.  I should have just ordered a burrito so as not to challenge the cooks too much. I hope they don't freeze those, too.

Until Don Juan decides to put the same level of effort into his food options as he does his beverage menu, I'm content to sit in the front waiting area, sipping my fresh pina coladas between the collection of sombreros and the wall dedicated to Frida Kahlo. Just bring me some chips and salsa if I'm getting a little tipsy."}
{"text":"This spot is absolutely terrific. Very authentic Mexican food and atmosphere. We've been here a number of time and each time we leave happy and full. Fast, friendly service. Great location right downtown"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town and it doesn't hurt that it's located downtown near where I work. The service here is always wonderful and you are greeted as soon as you enter. And in my experience, unless you come during First Fridays, you are typically seated immediately. Once seated, drink orders are taken pretty quickly and then fresh chips and salsa are brought to your table. Sometimes they automatically bring you guacamole too, which is an extra $5.99 charge, so if you don't want it you may have to tell them upfront.

The food is priced reasonably, although it can be considered expensive for Mexican food, depending on what you order. Regardless, the food comes out quickly and the portions are fairly large. I usually get the same few entrees: huevos rancheros if it's breakfast time, or enchiladas or fajitas if it's lunch/dinner time. The food is delicious, comes out hot, and I haven't had anything I didn't like. I've had margaritas on a few occassions and they are pretty large, whether frozen or on the rocks, although not very strong (surprise, surprise). If you like it strong, you may have to ask them for a few extra shots...

Sometimes when I'm here the owners and managers walk around the restaurant to check on each table, which I find nice. Not many casual restaurants focus on customer service anymore and it's always about speed now. The waitresses here are patient but speedy with drinks/orders at the same time. The only thing negative about this place is that parking can be kind of tough if you come when it's busy. They only have a couple dozen spots in the back, as well as some meter parking out front.

Overall, I enjoy this place whenever I stop by and am always recommending it to friends and family."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst Mexican food I've eaten in Las Vegas. I am not sure how it has 4 stars. I threw in a pity star for it being a locally owned small business, but even the chips were bad. How can the chips bad?

My SO and I stopped in here for dinner after going to an event nearby. The bean dip was really bland, like it was straight from a can. The salsa was marginally better but still sub par. 

He ordered enchiladas - 2 chicken, 1 cheese. The chicken didn't have any flavor, he said he would give them 2 stars. 

I ordered a cheese and jalapeño tamal and a cheese enchilada. The tamal could have used some more time in the steamer. The masa was bland and it wasn't fully cooked in the center. Inedible. The enchilada was better but still not very good. How can something be both soggy and crunchy at the same time? 

Very disappointed, would not recommend."}
{"text":"If you're looking for that delicious, authentic, hole-in-the-wall restaurant then you've found it! Just off the beaten path a bit, where tourists rarely venture, is Casa Don Juan.

The restaurant is quaint and comfortable with a lively Mexican atmosphere. Most of the staff members are very friendly and attentive. They will make excellent menu recommendations.

You have to get the queso dip! And the guacamole! Both really are amazing and make perfect starters. I've tried a lot on the menu and you honestly can't go wrong with whatever you choose. The food has a ton of flavor and is always prepared perfectly!

This is the kind of place you can go for dinner and drinks with a few friends and have a good time! You will have a delicious meal and leave satisfied."}
{"text":"This is the go to place for Mexican food here in Las Vegas. Just make sure you get here early so you can get parking"}
{"text":"First time customer seen it on yelp. Wonderful customer service.. really family oriented people friendly. Very persistent with the customer needs . After they already severed me my drink the waiter still came back to ask me if I still wanted water. That lets u know that there customers are always on there minds. I like the uniforms that the establishment wear real culture friendly. Very nice wonderful art all around the restaurant makes u feel a more at piece coming from outta town . And I myself recommend return to Casa Don Juan in the future. Also immaculate air-conditioning. No here was rude all the staff was amazing . I was there and seen another party of at least 12 people and the manager was out helping the waiter severe the family the best way possible. Now that's real team work. I think anyone who comes to Las Vegas sound stop by if you get the taste for Mexican food and music."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing! Quick service and very prompt with your drink/food order! One night (about a month ago) I took family here to enjoy a birthday. After I paid and made it to my car the hostess ran out like I never paid at all. They ended up charging me for the wrong bill.... So in addition to paying the bill they charged me they recharged me for the right bill.....It is now almost 25 days later and they charged me the amount they were supposed to charge me 25 days earlier.

There's one thing that you need to look out for with \"quick orders\" and that's making sure everything's cooked... Not cool when you get sick an hour after.....we will be taking a casa Don Juan brake."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Our group is from Texas so we were pretty hesitant to go to a Mexican restaurant in Vegas since we have great ones all around us at home.  I couldn't be happier that we decided to go to Casa Don Juans anyway. The chips and corn and flour tortillas are all made great fresh, and the salsa, been dip, guacamole, and queso were delicious. The cheese enchilada was one of the best I have had, made with cheddar instead of American cheese with a tangy housemade red sauce. 

The carnitas, steak ranchero, and burritos were also all huge hits. And the servers were all helpful, nice, attentive, and generally great. An all around great experience. 

One caveat, don't walk there from the strop or downtown. Pretty long walk through a somewhat shady looking neighborhood, take a cab and you're set."}
{"text":"Got the Groupon- awesome food, not too salty.  Service, OUTSTANDING- every server had a great expression on their face- good vibe = good food- exceptional, we will be back!"}
{"text":"From the street view, the restaurant looked unremarkable; but the minute we opened the door the warmth and homey feeling wrapped us up. What a crowd inside!!
Love the outfits of the staff worked there and the decor. The service was fine. 
But the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"First time eating here on 9.27.08 (Saturday) about 7:30pm with reservations made earlier in the day.  Guac was good, nice salsa and bean dip with chips;  impressed with the quality of meat in both the beef enchilada and chicken taco (only shredded is offered, which works for me!).  Others had carnitas; I tasted the dish, but it was too salty for me.

Cadillac margaritas were very good. 

A lot of dishes under $10 bucks, but majority of us had $11 - $15 dishes.  For eleven of us with tax and tip was about $275.00 (not a bad deal considering 6 beers, 5 Cadillacs and desserts)."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time it was really good..  I gotta say on some aspects it beats lindo Michoacán but on some it doesn't but that's Mexican restaurants there all different in there own way... and just because  I didn't speak Spanish I didn't get shitty service like some places do..... it was extremely good atmosphere and there salsa and beans  are different in a good way maybe from a different Mexican culture type of tradition cooking but it's a tourist recommendation.."}
{"text":"I believe I've came here about 5 times now, and I really never had a disappointing experience. My most recent experience I came here during lunch and surprisingly it wasn't too busy. They always start you off with fresh tortilla chips and the bean and salsa dip. We didn't have the guacamole this time, but I have tried it and boy is it delicious. I've never tried Huevos Rancheros before so I decided to give it a go. I was overall pleased with how it tasted. Eggs made over medium correctly and the rice and beans were super tasty. I've also tried their fajitas which were awesome, the meat was cooked perfectly and I loved the 'grilled' veggies that come on the hot platter.

They do make their tortillas fresh there, usually when I come in I see the lady making them. The place usually gets really warm and I can slightly feel the cool breeze blowing, but not enough to bother me. The service was 'OK' she came by a few times and checked on us, but took a while to grab our check. I do enjoy the food and the atmosphere. Location is very close to my house so I don't see myself not coming here."}
{"text":"Had a large group and they accommodated us very well ... Great service and food !!! Horchata is a must try !!!"}
{"text":"Went here this evening with my friend, she had been a few times with her co workers. Initially walking in the door the girl at the front wasnt very friendly when we asked about happy hour. She was a lil snippy and no reason to be. Sat down the waiter was very friendly and nice although I dont recall his name. He was very attentive and got our drinks and chips quickly. The menu I felt was way over priced 12.99 for 2 chicken enchiladas with beans& rice. Everything was 12.99 and up.. the food was flavorless except the green sauce. Felt like for the price it should have been alot better. I've been going to Chapala's for years and thought id try this spot but I have to say no comparison at all. I can't say I will go back again here."}
{"text":"Who's cooking here??  This food tastes like it came from a buffet, or a Robertos. The food lacks flavor, even the rice and beans!  I tried this place out on my birthday thinking I was getting authentic Mexican food and I was greatly disappointed after we got home with our to-go order. 

We ordered the pork chile verde--bland, beef in red sauce--also bland, the shrimp tacos--dry and bland, and a carnitas chimichanga which was incredibly salty and oily. Yuck.

Yelp reviewers have let me down on this one.  Plus the food is WAY over-priced. These 4 dishes cost $63!?!  They either over charged us or their prices are ridiculous for the lousy food they serve."}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with Casa Don Juan the first time I went there. However, since I had a Groupon, I had to go back. I am glad I did. The service was much better this time, and our food was actually served hot. I got the chicken fajitas. They were literally sizzling hot. The portion was quite generous. The fajitas were flavorful. I might actually go back, even if I don't have a Groupon."}
{"text":"They had the Groupon, so I decided to give this place a go. The pictures made it seem like real Mexican, so I was excited to try.

I had a pina colada (virgin), guacamole with chips and a chicken quesadilla. 

I really liked the guacamole. They serve it in some sort of edible tortilla bowl. Pretty good. You also get beans and salsa with chips. Beans are worst than canned beans. Absolutely no flavor. The salsa is too spicy for my palate, so I can't really judge.

The chicken quesadilla was just ok. Nothing to really write home about.

Overall, this place wasn't good enough to return to. Roberto's is way better and cheaper."}
{"text":"I was teetering between 3 and 4 stars, but the price is what sealed the deal for me to round down on this place.

If you find yourself in DTLV needing a quick bite to eat, Casa Don Juan will totally do it for you. This isn't authentic Mexican food; it's the super-fast Mexican-American style restaurant that can be found across the country. You know what I'm talking about -- the food tastes exactly how you think it will. And this isn't a slam at all -- sometimes I crave that stuff!

One thing to note that you can't find at every other Mexican place: handmade tamales! And they are delicious! Other things we tried were margaritas, queso, tacos, and beans and rice... all were totally fine. The service was super fast and friendly too. 

I did think the price was a bit too high for such fast-style Mexican food. Then again, this is Vegas, so I shouldn't have been so surprised."}
{"text":"Vegas tends to be about chain restaurants, trendy bars, and over the top decor but if you're searching for a \"hole-in-the-wall\" type Mexican food joint, this would be the place. 

The theme is your (hate to say it) typical Mexican cheese factor with the bright colors, tacky uniforms, and singing guitar guy but once you plop down in a booth and get snacking on their chips, salsa and guacamole, you'll forgive the rest. 

Are the chips made fresh? Nah, is the guacamole and salsa? Who knows. What I CAN tell you is that it's good! I dined on the chicken tacos after 2 baskets of chips and salsa and I found the rice, beans, and entree itself to be mighty tasty. 

Is it a show stopping place for Mexican food? Not really but if you want that authentic, non-chain feel that few and far between seem to offer in this town, then check out Casa Don Juan's. 

4 margaritas (I had company OK), guacamole, 2 entrees, and feeling happy and full cost us about $40! Not bad for good eatin."}
{"text":"First time here. Ivan gave us great service and the food was great too. The salsa that comes with the chips is very tasty and not really hot.. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Vegas is seriously lacking on good Mexican food; almost as much as Chinese. Most of the Mexican restaurants we have tried are a small step up from Taco Bell. Casa Don Juan is the saving grace here...

Every time I have gone they have been incredibly busy, yet they are still quick to get chips, drinks and orders out. The food is amazing. The guac is def fresh, the cheese dip is a meal in itself and its always difficult to save room for the amazing fried ice cream. 

I have ordered something different every time I've gone - the veggie burrito and the taco's are probably the best in my book, but it all looks good.

If you haven't gone here, go. It's the anti typical Vegas Mexican Restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was wack! Not sure what it was but it failed to live to my expectation Yelps followers lead its readers to fall into. I had a torta of carne asada and it simply failed to live to my tastel Not sure what else to say about this place. Interior décor is nice. Staff was cool. Chips and Salsa were wack....."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. There are a lot of authentic dishes that we try every time we go. Ivan, our server, was excellent. Many of the staff are attentive and polite. The whole establishment is welcoming. Again, best Mexican restaurant in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Little better than the average mexican restaurants in Vegas not the best though, portions are big my meal was good to share."}
{"text":"Food was good, granted all 6 of us didn't get what we ordered. Drinks came at least 20 minutes after sitting down, food came in another 15-20 minutes. All food orders wrong, drinks wrong. Luckily our wrong food was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"A friend and I went at lunch time and were seated right away. The service is good. Casa Don Juan is a traditional Mexican style cuisine. Being a Mexican food connoisseur I'd stay they are above average but not the best in Las Vegas. Some places I see could use room for improvement are their salsa and been dip. The salsa wasn't bad however it was a bit watery and the bean dip wasn't as thick as I'd like it to be. I ordered a cheese enchilada & a chili relleno. The cheese enchilada was good. I order one every where I go. The sauce could have a little more spice to it as they were slightly on the tomato-y side but they were very very good. The chili relleno was the first time I had ever had one and it was delicious. We ordered the green chili verde and the pork was tender . Rice & Beans were good. All in all good spot to go eat Mexican downtown. They have a full bar and gaming FYI"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Vegas.  It's a little taste of Mexico with great service and even better margaritas! I was in town for Cinco De Mayo and was able to get a table pretty easily. They had a live mariachi band and specialty drinks to celebrate.  The tequila vodka fruit punch was like a sangria on crack and delicious.   Do yourself a favor and get off the strip for a great meal!"}
{"text":"In town with the family for one night. Stayed on the strip. My cousin is a local now, but having come from upstate NY as well, he knows that excellent Mexican food is hard to come by. We went with 4 adults and 3 children for Easter dinner.  The food was amazing.  The service was outstanding. So worth getting off the strip for some outstanding food at great prices as well."}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa! And a cool atmosphere located in the heart of the arts district downtown.
Love all the Frida Kahlo deco.
The uniforms they wear are fun!
I like to order their shrimp ceviche, tamales and chile rellenos. They're always so fast no matter how busy they are because they are well staffed. 
Nice that they have occasional live music. 
The margaritas are good too! 
Just horrible parking!!!! And their bathroom always seems to be dirty..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great food get to this place! I went to a family dinner for my boyfriends sisters 21st birthday. The service was excellent and the food was amazing. I shared the chicken and steak fajitas with my boyfriend and they were so tasty! I highly recommend this place. For dessert they served the birthday girl a rather large slice of chocolate cake and put a sombrero on her head and all the employees, with sombreros as well, sang her happy birthday. Thanks for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"I tried their Lengua Chili Verde and it was pretty fantastic. :)

Casa Don Juan was packed tonight (just as packed as it is on First Friday) but the service was fast and attentive.  My waiter was really \"on top of things\" as he was juggling a few tables and helping celebrate a birthday on the table next to mine.  

(On a side note, if you know someone who really enjoys it when people sing \"Happy Birthday\" to them in public, this is TOTALLY the place!)

The Lengua Chili Verde was soooo tasty and was just the right amount for the tortillas that it came with.  I definitely recommend! 

I need to go back and try some of the other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"total tourist spot. We were even offered a photo taken at our table?? Weird. The food was crap, and way overpriced which is pretty normal for a place that doesn't expect locals to return.

pretty good margarita and that's about it and our server was on point

total disappointment price wise and food wise

I don't mind paying for something delicious but 6.99 for a cheese quesadilla for a child? I'll pass."}
{"text":"We came here for my grandma's birthday dinner and just like the rating says - meh, I've experienced better. I ordered a michelada and it was pretty bad; watered down. It was as if they took cheap tomato paste, a pinch of salt, and mixed it with a gallon of water. And it had BEER in it. Still tasted very watered down. I love micheladas but I didn't even get half way through this one. The food was okay but the process of the bill was beyond frustrating. I ordered just a burrito - it was a mix of meat and shrimp and I believe it was $13. I was asked if I would like a side of guacamole with it. I said sure. When my food came out it was covered in a sauce and had MAYBE a teaspoon of guacamole, which was run down and kind of brown LOL. I proceeded to eat half of it anyway, thinking they just threw in something extra. When I get the check, I got charged $18. Why? Because the sauce and \"side\" of guacamole. There is a burrito for that price - a full shrimp burrito, which I did not get, but had I known I was going to be charged that price, I would've ordered that. The least they could have done was tell me that I was going to get a $5 up-charge for the laughable sauce and drop of guacamole lol. Then, when we were getting ready to pay, I noticed my mom added a tip on top of the tip we were already charged for being such a large party. When I told her to remove it the cashier rolled her eyes at me. I will GLADLY stick to Lindo Michoacan."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Our family went in for late breakfast and was seated on a wobbly table. We asked to be moved, but nothing was done. Waiter spilled our drink on one of the plates and took him over 20 minutes to replace. We were already done with our meals. Manager was called and he did not offer to comp the dish that was replaced. I have never heard that a manager is unable to fix bill. He said he was sorry, yet our experience was destroyed. Never again will I go there. Horrible Customer Service."}
{"text":"Every time I end up going to Casa Don Juan, which is pretty much every First Friday because they're right down the street from where I'm hanging, there is an encounter with a crazy person or two.  Sometimes the crazy people are in my group yakking on and on about riding sheep, sometimes they're in the form of a large, older woman showing us the tattoo on her breast.  And in case you were wondering, yes it involved a rose.  Because of this and this alone, this very mediocre place gets an extra star.  I loves me some crazies!

The food is OK.  It's not scary or anything, and when you've got a Friday night, beer fueled hunger on it can be damn fine.  It's better than Macayo's even though the waitresses share uniforms, I think.  The service is pretty universally crappy.  Maybe it's because I'm there on what has to be their busiest night of the month, but seriously, one should not have to wait 20 minutes for a check.  

I would like to kiss the man who brought a fellow diner a side of sour cream on a plate.  A few minutes later, he reached for what he thought was his napkin and got a surprise.  It gave me a different crazy to look at to distract me from that lady's boob."}
{"text":"We've been living in Las Vegas for 20 years. FINALLY  we've found a Mexican restaurant that has put out the most delicious Mexican food that I believe rivals it's mother country.  If you don't try this place there's something wrong with you. It is a tad bit pricey which is the reason for the lack of a 5th star. 2 people, 2 entrees,  1 alcoholic beverage, 1 water = $54.00. Regardless though we WILL be back, and often."}
{"text":"Ok I have been coming to this particular restaurant every time I visit Las Vegas.  It's a tradition for my family/friends to come here now.  I have always been satisfied except my last trip to Vegas on my birthday March 6, of this year. 

Friends and I went on a Sunday afternoon craving and I mean craving a good bowl of menudo. 

1) Right of the bat we were told they didn't have any more and ran out at noon!  Ahh I can go to any burrito stand and get some on Sunday all day long! Come on I was expecting better than that from Don Juans!

2) Our server decided to give us extra time to rethink our choices.  We still wanted to stay and eat.  But instead of taking 5 min he took 20 to come back to our table!

3) The bus boy refilled our waters and chips while  still waiting for our server!

4) Once we got our orders in we were not disappointed.  

But seriously Don Juan please don't leave us hanging like that no more!  I mean this is a tradition for me so don't screw it up."}
{"text":"Food is great and drinks are great! Service is also very good! Def recommend as one of the best Mexican restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Blah .... that is the main flavor of the food we all experienced and we all had different dishes.  The salsa was the only thing on the table with any true flavor noted. We honestly have not been here before but my son was excited to try it as the place seems to be busy on First Fridays. As noted in other reviews, the service is ok - but they seemed eager for us to finish and leave - which wasn't relaxing. 

Well, now we know and we honestly will not be back - too many other places with great food."}
{"text":"I really used to swear by Casa Don Juan for lunch, dinner, drinks, late night...I even had my wedding weekend happy hour dinner there....but recently the service has taken a nose dive.  The waitresses are eager to push increasingly low quality guacamole on you and if you turn it down they really can't be bothered by you.

However, the food has remained really consistent.  The portions have shrunken a little bit on more expensive items (Fillet Veracruz), and when produce gets expensive they certainly cut corners...but if you know these things and order accordingly, you'll have a solid meal.  The pitchers of Hornitos margaritas don't hurt, either.

Really, if the service and the produce conditions increased, this restaurant would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"OK...I feel bad not giving them 5 stars.  The food is great.  Love the chips, salsa and guac...  What I don't love is using my groupon and being charged more at the table.  It sounds like fraud to me. Wait a minute...the hostess and waiter both said it is fraud too.  They blame Billy the manager and of course groupon.  The waiter was a nasty little guy till it came time for the tip.  The groupon clearly states 2 lunch entree's for $9.99.  Fine print states a value of up to just under $22.  All ok with me.  You can even take a peak at the menu via the groupon link.  The interesting \"fraudy\" part is that the prices reflected on the business website are not the same as on the menu.  Each item is about $2 more on the actual menu.  So it is impossible to actually use the groupon for the purchase price.  You have no choice but to pay more.  Again, the food is great. The groupon/fraud crap makes me not want to ever go back out of principal only.  Billy, fix the price discrepancy or honor the groupon...and teach your staff to not tell me it's \"fraud\" and they agree it is wrong.  The cashier stated that they have tried to call groupon and groupon is in control.  The interesting part is that the prices on the actual Casa Don Juan website are the same as on the groupon link.  This means that groupon has nothing to do with the price increase.  Casa Don Juan is getting greedy and misleading the customer by not honoring the groupon as it is intended.  There is not one item on the \"lunch/dinner\" menu that is $9.99."}
{"text":"BEWARE!
If you do a Groupon purchase don't tell them until after you get your Jumbo Margarita... we told them we had a Groupon and I'm almost positive that's why they hardly put any alcohol in it...we should've felt a little buzz from a drink that big... we didn't feel nothing but the feeling of getting ripped off..also when he brought my drink, he sat it in front of me and i said what's that black thing floating in my drink? it looked like nat or fruit fly... he was very apologetic but when he brought me another one it had lipstick on the outside of the glass..
We've been at this restaurant many times and never had a problem before.. the food was good as usual and i would've gave them 5 stars if it wasn't for the drink situation... We were upset because we get stronger drinks at the casino for free!
I really think it was the Groupon Ticket they were trying to make up the money they are losing on the discount.."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant 4 star ONLY because k haven't tasted everything. 

Their menudo is on point. Great Cadillac marg's. However, k had the chilaquiles con steak this past Sunday and omg, my mouth has watered ever since. A nice, tender piece of arrachera atop seasoned and sauces chilaquiles and an egg over medium? PERFECTION. The guac, SS's and bean dip w chips was mmmmm mmmm mmmm too!"}
{"text":"Downtown? Craving for tequila and Mexican favorites? Sate your soul with the deliciousness that is Casa Don Juan. Leave with that omg I'm full, omg I can't walk in a straight line either, kinda feeling."}
{"text":"I was hoping that I did not have to write a review about Casa Don Juan as two stars but I have to be completely honest in my rating.  We were in the neighborhood and decided to give them a shot during the \"Cinco de Mayo\" celebrations.  They were planning three days of festivites 3rd-5th we decided on the kickoff party on Sunday.  How disappointing this visit was.  

The staff the greeted us right away and we were seated shortly.  This is where the service took a turn for the worst.  It took several minutes for someone to greet us at the table and get the beverages ordered.  We decided on a couple of margarita's one on the rocks and one blended.  On the rocks is my preference but my lady friend had the blended and you could not taste the tequila or sweet and sour in that one.  The blended was not the best tasting drink I have had very watery and lacked flavor besides the salted rim.   

Now the big fiasco starts during the order process.  We were looking for a veggie burrito which they had on the menu for $8.00 or so but the server said No! you should order the number 35 which was $13.99.  We needed a build your own burrito with beans, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, guac wrapped in a tortilla.  Easy right?? Well, I had to repeat myself about SIX times to ensure it would come out correctly and even then it did not.  Beans were served on the side with rice and the tortilla was filled with lettuce, cheese and sour cream only. Not sure what happened??? I brought it to there attention and all I got was Sorry! That's it. WTF?

My Enchilladas were ok.  I had the order of 3 and went with one of each of beef, chicken and cheese.   I opted for both green and red sauce on top. one was supposed to be spicier than the other but I could not tell.  The kids share the nacho order but for $6.99 and made incorrectly than requested.  We recieved a plate full of tortilla chips with beans, melted cheese, and sour cream.  No tomato or guac as requested but the meat was on the side which was correct.  

The food was completely ordinary.  Nothing memorable at all.  what was memorable was the service or lack there of.  Slow throughout the entire dining experience.  What was more of a concern was the lack of enthusiam on the employees faces.  I did not see anyone besides the host smiling.  The bar tenders both the male and female looked as if they were mean as junk yard dogs. Very unwelcoming.   This is supposed to be a \"Cinco De Mayo\" Celebration and none of the staff looked like they were having fun or were even interested in working Sunday.  What a shame.  The first impression of Casa Don Juan was not a great one and we will not likely be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Decor & atmosphere is spot on, staff is friendly, but food is bland and boring. Imagine if Taco Bell opened a restaurant with table service..... actually Taco Bell may have better food. I've been here maybe 4 times total b/c I always forget its no good. Then I get my food and I remember: \"Oh yeah, we hate this place. Why did we come here again?!\""}
{"text":"5 star service, food, and price.

I love mexican food and eat it all the time living down in San Diego, but I was very surprised to find the best tamale I have ever eaten at a place just off the vegas strip.  I tried the cheese and jalapeno tamale.  The masa was moist and flavorful and there was a perfect amount of filling.  I also had an awesome vegetarian burrito (only like $5) that was simple and delicious.  I got a side of mole to dip it in, as I love to do with any place that has mole,  it was very good.  As you know, moles vary quite a bit.  This one was dark, smokey, and had a stronger balance towards a rich pepper flavor as opposed to a sweeter chocolate one.  

They start you off with some great salsa and a bean dip with chips.  Love it!  I only regret not trying a margarita from this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a very glowing recommendation from my boss.  

First, parking is tough but we did find a spot.  We walked in, it was loud and we were not greeted.  Finally, someone says \"two\" and I nod, not knowing who I am speaking with and she proceeds to come around a corner to seat us.  She put us at the smallest table I have ever seen.  It was so squished between two tables that we were unable to sit down.  The hostess dropped the menus and walked away.  We moved the table, physically so each of us could sit down one at a time.  

We sat, we sat some more, and finally a bus boy brought us waters, chips and salsa.  

We continued to wait until I had to flag down a waiter.  

My boss said he orders a top shelf margarita, pork tamale and beef enchilada, so my husband and I ordered that exact same thing.  

The chips were stale tasting the salsa seemed out of a can, the beans were very runny.  After finishing off the basket of chips because we were so starved our food finally arrived, the margarita was warm, the red sauce on the enchilada has no flavor like it came right out of a can.  The tamale didn't have the meat inside the masa, it was set on top.  We ate maybe half and then waited forever to refills on our water and the check.  

We have been told by others to give it a second chance but I don't see this happening."}
{"text":"Love CDJ.  

Old school Vegas in Mexican restaurant form.

Pretty diverse menu, good service, and good food.

I stop in whenever I get a chance."}
{"text":"I don't want to come off as mean or condescending but I didn't have the best experience here. First the presentation is pretty good l. The restaurant had all the looks and feel of a traditional restaurant. The service was great as well, I had to wait because the order got mixed up but that was fine. What wasn't fine was the food. I had a beef and chicken fajita plate. The food was horribly bland, even the bell peppers on the plate didn't have any flavor. Overall I probably won't eat here again but everything else was great but there's no reason for me to eat somewhere that I didn't enjoy the food."}
{"text":"When Downtown, my business partner and I will come here for lunch.

Growing up in the south, I have eaten a lot of Mexican food, This place will satisfy your craving. When you sit down , you get chips, salsa & beans.
Chips - great, Salsa - I've had better Beans - they need to be seasoned. 

 Big fan of their Caldo soup, however I wish they would trim the meat off the bones and just keep the bones in while cooking and not serving them to you. Great sides of onions, cilantro & limes to add in to your bowl of beef, vegetables & broth. 

Service is excellent! Atmosphere is good too!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Super delicious food. Jumbo margaritas taste better with extra shot of tequila. They offer great deals on groupon and restaurant.com. We come here at least once per month. Excellent service."}
{"text":"This restaurant was alright. The service wasn't too bad. They took awhile in the beginning to get to us. The reason for 3 stars is because they took awhile to even ask us for drinks. After we ordered drinks it took them about another 10-15 minutes to come by and acknowledge us. They finally got to the table and asked us what we would like to eat. I ordered a beef chimichanga, which was delicious. However my girlfriend ordered the chicken and shrimp fajitas and upon receiving the food, it was cold. It also didn't have enough seasoning in it. This wouldn't be the first place on my list to recommend downtown."}
{"text":"So far the best Mexican food we have had in Las Vegas...love the location and the atmosphere. Service was impeccable and reasonably priced. The staff goes beyond regular customer service Sunday Brunch is the bomb.com"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food!  Busy Mothers Day lunch was perfect.  Carnitas was excellent and  the green herb drink I ordered was fantastic.  My wife and I enjoyed the atmosphere, food and outstanding service  from Javier!"}
{"text":"OK guys let me start off by saying until just about 3 years ago I have lived in Orange and Los Angeles Counties.  I was born and raised in So Cal. I have done my grocery shopping at Mercado's.  I've had many a drunken, reckless, eat till you burst and drink till you puke night in baja.  I have smuggled fireworks and Cuban, or what I was told were, Cuban cigars across the border and yes, I have most likely eaten dog or donkey tacos in Tijuana.  So If I am well versed enough to speak my mind about anything it would be Mexican food.  With all that being said...On with the review.

My quest for good humble Mexican food in the Vegas valley has been 3 years in the making and time after time I have been disappointed.  This place however was good.  It was not bad but it was not out of this world fantastic.  I ordered a shrimp ceviche tostada 3 tacos, one carne asada, one al pastor, and one lengua to get a full range of flavors.  The lengua was pretty damn good moist, tender and flavorful, the same goes for the pastor it had good flavor, good texture and the taste was pretty impressive.  Now this was not the case with the asada.  The carne asada taco was dry and overcooked I would like to think I just got a bad batch but who knows.  

OK on to the ceviche. The ceviche was again not fantastic but better than just average.  I would like to have seen whole shrimp instead of the diced pieces of shrimp that they used here .  There was also a lot of diced tomatoes to act as filler.  If this same exact restaurant was located in Long Beach, CA I most likely would have given it 3 stars instead of 4, but considering the number of bad experiences I've had in Vegas, Casa Don Juan has acted as a glimmer of hope and provided this Californian a taste of home."}
{"text":"We went to eat here on a Saturday night. Called ahead first because they're was 8 of us. Food was great. Carne Asada is very tender and they have homemade tortillas. Priced very reasonable. Service was fast and great. We decided to go back the next morning on Sunday with s party of 25. Just as good and menudo was awesome."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I were on the prowl for Mexican food. We decided to drive around downtown and found this gem. The service was prompt and courteous. I had some margaritas that were great and possibly the best green chilaquiles I've had at a restaurant. The restaurant had a very authentic appeal and for a moment I forgot I was in las vegas. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good authentic meal. Also, I was given a heads up that the seafood wasn't the best of choices so if you try it and it's good let me know. Haha."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Easily the best mexican food I've had in the 2.5 years of living in Las Vegas. I had a combination plate of a taco, chile relleno and a tamale. The relleno was top notch and the taco was great (asada if it matters). The tamale wasn't bad but nothing special. If not for the poor service, would have been a five star review. We had guac show up ten minutes before we had chips at the table and it took probably 15 minutes to get margaritas. In all fairness, the place was busy as hell but it's my understanding it's always like that here."}
{"text":"I had used a Groupon today at casa Don Juan Javier was my server, well at least was supposed to be. Javier was extremely rude and paid no attention to my party. Other servers were even coming to check up on us. I asked Javier to bring me the check and he just handed me the check with no words and walked away. He then told another server to explain to me the check break down. I then just walked up front paid and left. I will never go to casa Don Juan again I live right down the street and go there frequently. Thanks Javier you lost my business."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem in Vegas. Happened to find it because we went shopping at all the retro stores on that same street. I judge Mexican restaurants by their salsa...as my first impression anyway.  The salsa was great. The place is clean, decorated beautifully, awesome bar, I loved my margarita, and service was great too. Food came out fast. I will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas!)"}
{"text":"Closest food to authentic mexican food! Its delicious and the home made tortillas are priceless!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, I feel the handmade flour tortillas with butter that melt in my mouth are the best , no Mexican breakfast is better , homemade and plenty of food this is an all day breakfast and before 11:00am the price is lesser. Drinks are good and  improved since their new bar came into place. I feel these are the best items. A 5 star breakfast!
Dinner is average but a fun place with usually good service."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate my 42nd Birthday. We were seated immediately and served our food not long after arriving. The food was excellent and our service was even better! We had several gentlemen constantly checking up on us. Definitely our new favorite place to go for Mexican food"}
{"text":"Normally, I love Casa Don Juan. The pollo endiablo (spelling definitely wrong there) is delish, and homemade tortillas? To die for. Did I mention the make fried ice cream with Fruity Pebbles? SO GOOD! I've been here twice before and had a wonderful experience each time with great service - today was almost bad enough to make me not want to return.

The waiter was exceptionally bad. First, my friend tried to order a side of soup; apparently the sides of soup aren't sold on Sundays, okay, that's weird but whatever, she adjusted. Her salad came a good 15 minutes before my chicken, so she was nearly finished by the time I barely started. We went to order our favorite, the fried ice cream. We were kept waiting for about 10 minutes after ordering and then the waiter came back to tell us that there was no fried ice cream today because the ice cream was too soft. Um, you can't stick that in the freezer? His reply was chilling (even if the ice cream wasn't) : \"The freezers aren't strong enough to freeze ice cream.\" 

WHAT?

While I was screaming to get out of there and questioning where my meat was kept, if not in this subpar freezer, my friend asked him to recommend an alternate dessert. His response: \"I don't really like the food here. I like Puerto Rican food better so I don't really eat here. The sopapillas look kinda good.\"

We ended up giving up on getting anything sweet from there and just flat out left. The waiter didn't charge us for my friend's salad, which was appreciated considering 2/3 of our orders were rejected, but my advice to that waiter - if you don't like the food at the restaurant, at least have one or two recommendations that you can somewhat stomach! Sometimes honesty isn't the best policy.

Still deciding if we'll be back... that fried ice cream is pretty magical. But I think I want proof the freezer works, first."}
{"text":"Casa Don juan is the best authentic mexican food in the Las Vegas Valley by far! No other can come close the food or service! It's always a pleasant experience! 
I also brought my wedding party here for dinner before the wedding and the staff handled my group of 30 without hassle and professionalism and made us all feel at home.

{"text":"Love it here the food is amazing!!!! And he service is always great!!! If your in Vegas or around this area don't pass it up! Our server was super handsome and had a nice booty! So that was a plus hahaha will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Casa Don Juan gets 3 stars because the description is spot on, \"A-OK.\" I like going here, it's like my mom's most favorite Mexican restaurant ever. However, if I had a choice I would go to Lindo Michoacan.

The last time we went was for my boyfriends birthday. My mom ordered a whole fried fish covered in garlic. The thing could have easily fed 4 people. It smelled wonderful. However, I have a problem eating anything that stares back at me. I opted for two shredded beef enchiladas.  They were very flavorful and came with very large portions of rice and beans covered in cheese. My bf had a combo plate and he also seemed to enjoy it as well.

The portions are huge and very filling. That is usually the problem for me at Casa Don Juan. Now I am not complaining about being served a goodly amount of food for some pretty reasonable prices, but for some reason, every time I go, and no matter the amount of food I eat, it sinks like a stone later. And its not like I over eat each time. I seriously go into a food coma afterwards, and it feels like my stomach is filled with lead.

As for the margaritas and pina coladas, hmm, they were not sweet. I've had better ones at Outback . . .

I do have to add that they have excellent service. The server asked if it was a special occasion. We told him yes. They were going to bring us some free ice cream but we told them we were Very full. Instead he brought a plate of whipped cream which he dabbed on my bf's nose and the servers sang a birthday song to him. They also have one of those photo ops, where they take a picture of your group and give you a free postcard then later try and sell you a photo (totally optional and there was no pressure)."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now - once for lunch and once for dinner. Both times I have gotten below-average Mexican food. My fajita meat was so dry that it was almost inedible and required an awful lot of water to get it down. My enchiladas were bland and flavorless. Their margaritas are great, though, and are hella strong!

Decor is colorful and bold, but the layout is terrible and doesnt cancel out noise. The restaurant is VERY loud and it was challenging to hear my friend from across a table! The blender at the bar also is really noisy and we had to stop our conversation every time it went off."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my Burrito Mojado and taco. The food was really good, the atmosphere was nice, and the service was on point. A great spot for a downtown getaway day."}
{"text":"Great authentic mexican  food. Its been here for years and they have great fast service for lunch. They have it down to a science for service."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food!  A good find down near the arts district.  Authentic food at reasonable prices decent portions.  The chips and salsa are very good and tasty.  The fajitas were excellent! ! Had very good service."}
{"text":"This was a great find. A very nicely decorated place with a nice atmosphere. Great service! The food is just about as good as it gets in Las Vegas. Served hot, fresh and delicious. I look forward to our next visit. Thanks, guys! Great job, Ivan and crew! Just get that Jose Cuervo Gold out of there, will you? That's not a real tequila, folks. Five stars would have been rated if not for your proud mentions and sales of what most tequila drinkers don't consider actual tequila."}
{"text":"The margaritas at Don Casa Juan Mexican restaurant we're not bad. I ordered the strawberry margarita and my friends ordered a Cadillac watermelon margarita. They brought us free chips, beans, and salsa to go with our margaritas. The staff was very friendly and we received a free picture of us. Next time we come back to this restaurant we will have to eat a meal."}
{"text":"So, apparently, since the last time I reviewed this place, they fired the bad cooks, and brought back the good ones. Now, everything is better. The food is ASTOUNDING (I had the cheese tamales and an enchilada, my wife had the chile relleno), the atmosphere has improved (it's definitely more fun, now), and the staff seems happier. In fact, well, just thinking about it makes me want to go back. 

SO glad they got it back together. I'll be heading back, soon!"}
{"text":"This place is the best authentic Mexican food you can have. I wish they had one like this is California. This place is truly amazing has a Mexican feel to it but very clean and the staff is friendly. Our server Raul was very friendly and helpful. The
Enchiladas are to die for and the Mexican hot chocolate. The price is great for the food you get. I truly recommend this place anytime of day."}
{"text":"So this place has consistently been getting worse each time I've been coming here.  Not sure if they plan on getting better.

A huge vegetarian alert:  according to Javier, almost everything is cooked with lard....even the chips.

That's sad as the last time I asked he didn't mention that.  Service can definitely be improved."}
{"text":"Menudo was bomb!!! Fresh handmade tortillas. The Tamarindo Margarita is THE best. The Mango margarita is tooo sweet. Service was ok, server was not attentive, forget what you asked."}
{"text":"Very yummy! The beans are not vegetarian...you can taste the animal fat in them. Not good for everyday but a very yummy treat! Tacos come in homemade tortillas. And they make a good salsa and a good iced tea. 

I'd totally go again!"}
{"text":"mill of tourista food.  middle of the road service.  Good drinks if you order the big ones. 
not a deal, not sure why people like this place.  

But, I go to places where they barely speak English...and chips.salsa are free.  

$$$ for dinner and a large margarita can book up past $30."}
{"text":"To be honest, this place is awesome. Friendly staff, fresh fruit margaritas, incredible (and moist!) tamales...the el pastor....yum. They even serve bean dip and cheese dip in the little salsa dishes! Bomb. Sunday funday family
Vibes!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be way better. I feel like the quality of food has gone down. It's still good but not as good as it used to be and the prices have gone up  a lot. The service is great they do have that going for them. I had a caldo de res and it was okay I wish it would have had potatoes in it like it's suppose to."}
{"text":"I actually give this place no stars.... I ordered a raw fish tostada and I got shrimp, then they gave me the correct one but with a surprise. A HAIR. SMH I'll never eat here period."}
{"text":"Solid legit simple but tasty mexican, nothing too fancy, but you will enjoy the crowd, the decorations inside, the colorful things all over and the incredible service.  Food is good, one step up on the food and they get a 5 star, service 6 star, prices not cheap but reasonable for the take....one tip...order the HABENARO SAUCE on the side, this is the hot stuff and its insane and sublime in its structure,......I ate it with every bite!!  Enjoy!   BURB!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  Get the Cadillac margaritas and anything on the menu.  Friendly staff. Enjoyed being away from the casinos.  They do have a few video poker machines at the bar. You will let ve rhe food! Cheers"}
{"text":"sis-in laws, hubby and friends meet here it was fun and I did like my mole but hubby didn't like his dish, the other they were ok with what they order so I don't have nothing bad to say about this place"}
{"text":"Loved them for many years. 
Delicious food and fantastic service. 
Drink specials and not a long wait even thought super busy 
Recommend highly
Muy bueno!!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Mexican options in Vegas, especially for its price point. The meat is always cooked really well and the service has been great in my experience."}
{"text":"While in Vegas for the New Year, my wife and I decent we wanted some Mexican food. We have some close friends who are locals in Vegas and asked if they wanted to join us. We ended up here on the suggestion of our Lyft driver ( I'm glad he stepped in because we were getting ready to really miss out).  First off, this placed was packed which is a great sign that the food is delish. Second off, they give you free bean dip and salsa and I must say that it was Elite when you combined the two together. 

Need let's get to the food. The Menu is loaded with several different combos to fit what you are looking for. I went with the two enchiladas plate that came with rice and beans. The enchiladas  one beef and One chicken were covered in a verde sauce that had the perfect spice. The food was perfect. When I hit Vegas again and want some Mexican this is the only spot for me."}
{"text":"I think I've passed by the place, about 100 times and kept telling myself, \"Should I try this place?\" Well, the answer is, maybe once.

This isn't a \"meh,\" and it's not an \"A-OK\" it's more of a, \"Eh, ok.\" This place was packed last Friday night with a lot of families and older folks holding out for a table. We opted to sit at the bar and avoid waiting for thirty minutes to eat. The bar area was pretty dirty, both the back bar and the front bar had old plates and previous diner's old cocktail glasses on them along with a half eaten bag of Cheetos, I'm assuming they were the bartender's snack. 

My wife and I decided to share a combo plate, two tacos, a Chile Relleno and Tamale. This wasn't the prettiest plate of food, but it did what it was supposed to do, fill us up. The tamale was pretty dry, too much masa and not enough Verde chicken inside. The filling inside was decent, but was hard to find. The Chile Relleno was a cheese bomb, the cheese was all I could taste, they used a very sharp cheddar and it blew any chile flavor out the window. I tried the taco, and after one bite it fell apart. The meat was flavored nicely, but the shell was something that reminded me of taco day in High School. 

The food and service are ok, and if this is your last resort for eats on Main Street, it will do the trick, but don't seek this place out."}
{"text":"Pretty much all the Yelpers got it right, a fun place with good food at a reasonable price. Visiting friends asked for Tex-Mex, I Yelped and Casa Don Juan popped up. On a Sat Nite we had to wait for seating for 8 as the place was packed. The menu is extensive and has just about every combination and alacarte item you can think of. A excellent choice for atypical Tex-Mex experience."}
{"text":"Great service and the ambiance was perfect. Our waiter was on top of everything and our meals were delicious. Salsa and chips were amazing. I definitely recommended stopping by if you're in the mood for Mexican!"}
{"text":"I took my son here for dinner yesterday before going to a show, I had a groupon and looked forward to trying this place out. I showed the waiter the groupon and he gave item #'s to choose from, my son ordered Chilaquiles & steak con huevo con arroz y frijoles. When food arrived there was no steak in the chilaquiles? Puzzled we asked and the waiter said, it would cost more so he did not place that order. Hmmm I've never been to a place where they make the decision of not placing my full order because of cost. Will not go back, there are so many delicious MX restaurants in town that serve you what You Order! Geeeesh I was stunned and that put a damper on dinner. The show we went to was awesome though LOL"}
{"text":"The food is ok but not worth the money and  the customer service is absolute garbage. We purchased a groupon for this place as it seemed like a great deal but once we walked in and once we were seated informed our server that we had a groupon (which is pretty customary) they seemed offended that we even had a groupon. It was all down hill from there... the server Jesus B. was very slow and impatient- it almost seemed that he was attending us in horrible manner on purpose. Food was cold, refills were constantly late. It would give this negative stars if I could. Not worth the time and money."}
{"text":"We were looking for a Mexican restaurant in the area and decided to stop in. The reviews were pretty good so we assumed that the place was going to be good.  We made a wrong assumption.  

The parking lot looked pretty intimidating because of the tow signs so plastered all over the place. We were seated and the waitress came by shortly to greet us and take our drink orders. We didn't decide yet so we asked for waters in the meantime.  

At least 15 minutes went by and she never came back. I really want to leave at that point. Finally we flag another server to get our waitress. She finally shows up and takes our order. 

We ordered 2 lunch specials and 2 horchatas. The lunch specials came with a salad. It was the cheapest ingredients they could find. They made the salads swim in dressing. It was really disgusting. I couldn't eat it.  Horrible just horrible.  The entrees were out pretty quickly.  The tacos were generic tasting.  The refried beans are the ones from the can and the rice was bland. I don't understand why they name themselves \"authentic,\" because it's far from it. Anyways we had to ask for our drinks to another server. Why am I not surprised? The staff must of been taking a siesta at that time.

This place is a disaster. Not sure how they have 4 stars. Maybe they told their whole family to write a good review on their behalf. Worst Mexican food I've had in my life."}
{"text":"Every time I come here it's so delicious !! Great service .. Great authentic food .  I noticed they embroidered the employees names  on their shirts . That's awesome .  That little detail makes a big difference, makes them look very professional.  Live this place ."}
{"text":"Ok so I've been going back since the first time I came here and gave them a review. Well let me start with the POZOLE is super and the staff is always awesome and on point and Aurelia is there to make sure we get the best service thru out the whole restaurant. Anything you get on the menu is fire . So you won't be disappointed. Give them a shot if your local or if your visiting your going to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Barely makes a four because of good ingredients, good wait staff, good food, and somewhat reasonable prices. I think the food ingredients, authentic, put it over the top. Although this is Mexican American food, it's just as good as anything you'll find in Corpus Christi or Chula Vista. 

Lots of seafood possibilities here, too. If you're a low-carb, veggie/vegan, let them know. There are sneaky ingredients at work here, but they'll listen and alter recipes to taste/preference. 

It has formal dining, and lots of Las Vegas locals, rather than the tourist business, although it's located in the very touristy Arts District (currently being repaved, but lots of free parking). This is my fourth time here, and it's been good each time. Recommended for small groups. A little kitschy here and there, but lots of fun and good food. I cannot vouch for the drinks."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican restaurant near downtown. We had a party of 35 and the staff fit us in perfectly (reservations of course). Margaritas were spot on but their Sangria was strange to me and not a hit with anyone. I loved the restaurant dedication to famous Mexican artist (forgot name, hers not mine). Chili Verde was top of the line tasty."}
{"text":"Food is amazing here. I ran into this place by accident and figured what the hell let's give it a shot! I was not sorry!! We get greeted by who I think was the owner and get seating almost immediately. Super nice servers took our order and has chips salsa beans and guacamole within a minute! Food was fresh and tasted amazing!! If yoy come Saturday or Sunday come early and try their menudo!!! Outside of my mother's menudo this is the best I've ever had!! Over all great place! Definitely my new place to come when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"mi primera vez en este lugar al cual llegue por casualidad.me quedo impresionada de la atencion por parte del personal la comida exelente autrntico sabor mexicano los tamales, las carnitas delicioso muy feliz de encontrar este Lugar."}
{"text":"I love this place, their chicken tacos are amazing, their chips and bean dip are amazing, their salsa sucks, their ice cold coke never runs dry, I love it here. Problem is, when ever I go, I have to go alone, because everyone I know hates it here..."}
{"text":"We come here all the time. The food is good and quick. The service is fantastic. Great place to bring friends."}
{"text":"I went here mid afternoon the day after Cinco De Mayo.  The place was very busy but my friend and I got seated right away.  The ambiance was good, the help were friendly and attentive.

My friend raved about the food, having been there a few times before.  It was good, but except for the salsa, I wasn't impressed.  Not to say that my home cooked Mexican is super, but I actually make better.  

I had a house Margarita, at nine bucks a bit pricey, as is the food.  I will probably go back if in the neighborhood, but for better food at good prices I will stick with Juan's Flaming Fajita on the west side of town."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some friends. Prices are to expensive, and food was ok. Nothing special or unique, the shrimp fajitas I got lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Sometimes a well-planned coincidence is just what you need.  Yes, I realize that the word planned coincidence is an oxymoron, an oxymoron like Casa Don Juan.  First of all, the decor looks a little too festive and forcefully Mexican.  Any Mexican joint with that many framed photos of Frida, well, has something to prove.  Second of all, I ended up there as a result of an odd calculation with a close girlfriend who lives across town, as it so happens, Casa Don Juan seems the exact middle point of distance for us.  With such contrived factors in play, I expected the food to disappoint.  What a pleasant surprise Don Juan was!

The frigid January evening in the Vegas dessert is off to a fun start with really good live Mariachi music, the soft and painfully romantic kind of Mariachi that makes any woman wish she was living life with a South-of-the-Border lover, or maybe just with Mariachi music as the soundtrack.

A request for black beans (a blessing and curse from P90X nutrition plan) ends up with a waiter's \"no\" response, accompanied by the \"this is authentic Mexican, we don't do healthy\" glance.  However, he was nice enough to give me whole beans before they refry them in lard.  Beans were good, rice was good, tortilla was warm, and good.  But the mole sauce on the chicken was, well, a perfect reminder of my college crush on Mexican culture.  Flavorful spices and a hint of chocolate left heat on my tongue to be remembered.

So now I'm listening to La Paloma Negra by Lila Downs for the rest of the evening, the things that good mole will do to you!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Would highly recommend it, the waitress and waiters were amazing. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Average food with sub-par service. Ordered Italian dressing on my salad, got blue cheese. Ok. Ordered chicken, got shredded beef. Whatever.  Ordered the guacamole, it was simple and fresh, but all in all, nothing to bring me back."}
{"text":"I'll keep this simple...you want decent Mexican food at a reasonable price the \"Casa\" has it....try it once and you will return."}
{"text":"This place was so good 
This is my first actual review in a long time but I thought I would do one real quick while the experience was still fresh in my head 
The place wasn't very packed for the time we came in 
It had a nice ambiance with a very authentic Mexican style 
This place reminded me of a place my gma would take me to when the was younger"}
{"text":"Ivan best server, this place has excellent customer service and the food is great, and they have hand made tortillas"}
{"text":"The best strawberry margaritas and fresh tortillas!! The atmosphere is great, the staff are attentive and the service is quick!"}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food ever. The coffee was disgusting, it tasted like water. I have to admit that the guacamole was good though.  But other then that, I do not recommend this place at all. The price you pay is not worth the food they serve you. I'd rather pay $5 more to eat at a buffet!"}
{"text":"Great service and margaritas.  The food is really tasty too and they always have good advertising deals..."}
{"text":"First Friday was pretty busy. for all three of us and me ordering the wrong order the first time it turned out to be around ~$67"}
{"text":"My husband and I met friends there for dinner last night and the food and service were awesome. I ordered a carnitas burrito wet and it was one of the best if not the best burrito I've ever had. At 65 I'm no spring chicken and I've grown up on homemade and restaurant Mexican food so that's saying something. My husband ordered the tamale, enchilada, taco combo and enjoyed it very much. He wasn't a huge fan of the tamale saying it was just OK. It wasn't our first time there and it certainly won't be our last!"}
{"text":"omg I guess any restaurant with a long line is a good one! Specially a mexican restaurant with a lot of hispanic patrons!

The food was SO good, like more orgasm on a plate. The tortilla were handmade, really really good! I stuffed my cheeks till i couldnt move.

The Margaritas were a little too sweet for me... I still prefer the ones at dona marias. But the food here... to die for!"}
{"text":"Super good food and great atmosphere. The servers were all so friendly. Posole was darn good. Tried their handmade corn and flour tortillas and they were delish. My mom had carne tampiqueña and it was cooked so well - because of course, I tried that too. Lol."}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service! Ivan was our waiter and did a great job. The menudo and champurrado are outstanding!!"}
{"text":"First time customer, now customer for life!
I have lived in Las Vegas for 20 years, and this is now my favorite place. 

Ivan's customer service is wonderful !"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great flavor! Prices can be a little high on some items. But well worth it. Handmade tortillas. Friendly service! BOMB, BEANS!! THE BEST REFRIED BEANS EVER!!!
Endless Chips & Salsa! Every California visitor we get, we take them here"}
{"text":"Jerry was the best! I eat a lot of a food so I probably gave him a hard time during the rush. But he was very nice. Definitely a class act. Marco was very prompt with the drinks and chips and salsa as well great place! We'll be back"}
{"text":"The TAMALES...
.
**2017 Yelp 100 Challenge #13 **
.
This place was just somewhere we stumbled upon because we were hungry before a YEE that was happening across the street & I needed to eat something before the event since there wasn't food other than hot dogs which are like one of my least favorite foods. The inside seems like an authentic back in the days Mexican restaurant. Whole bunch of COLORFUL decorations everywhere w/ stuff hanging all over the ceilings. 
.
We sat at the bar since we were going to be quick & we just kept sitting at the bar ever since. There is this one guy bartender that we love w/ his Hispanic accent he is quick & funny & attentive just right. Forgot his name... =/

we didn't really explore to much into the menu &  just ordered what we were craving at the moment.

CHIPS W/ SALSA & BEAN DIP $0 - AHHHH this is the best kind of complimentary chips & salsa bean dip that we have tasted. i dunno what they use in their been dip but it is just SO addicting!!! literally makes you want to order a whole bowl and put it on EVERYTHING

CHICKEN W/ GREEN SAUCE TAMALES $3.75 - the chicken was nice & tender. could have possibly used a little more seasoning but i just added some of the complimentary salsa & bean dip.

CHEESE W/ JALAPENOS $3.75 - this was cheesy oooo eee goooeyy yummyness & it was warm & just perfectly made

TOSTADAS CAMARON $7.75 - this dish was freaken AWSOME! SO much freaken shrimp for a little taco. Definitely had to use some of the complimentary chips to eat the rest of the shrimp. The shrimp was chopped up w/ some veggies mixed w/ citrus & topped off w/ avocado.

Definitely will be coming back every time we want some margaritas & tamales & tostadas!!
."}
{"text":"I've been going to Casa Don Juan for years, but hadn't visited in more than 6+ months. It looks like the plating and service has changed quite a bit. This time around I went in with a groupon (2 Dinner entrees and 2 Jumbo Cadillac Margaritas for a $46 value) and a group of 3 people.

We tried ordering a Thursday special of Sopes without the margaritas they come with and we were told they couldn't charge us for the food without the drinks. Having tasted the jumbo cadillac margaritas we had received from the initial groupon we turned down the offer of getting additional margaritas. Why you might ask? They tasted less than mediocre and whoever made them was horrible at mixing! It also shows the lack of flexibility and management experience when the manager doesn't know how much to charge for food if its not printed on a 'special' pamphlet as well. We didn't mind paying a difference, and ended up ordering one Sope as a separate dish which truly wasn't a sope but a tortilla with chorizo on it.  

I give Casa Don Juan 3 stars for seating us promptly and being attended quickly by the servers with chips, bean dip and drinks. The restaurant was clean and it had musicians playing authentic Mexican Corridos with guitars. Definitely set the mood. The cheese dip was great and so was the handmade corn tortillas! But the food is fair, there's no sopa de fideo and we couldn't get over the horrible alcoholic beverages. Some of the staff doesn't understand English, glad we're Mexican and can speak spanish! Parking is also bit tricky and difficult to find-  unless you want to park at a meter-  because it was packed! Not the best yet not the worst experience. Our final bill was $65, we only paid about $30 with tip due to the groupon. For that amount you could go to another Mexican restaurant in a nicer area/location. Maybe in 6+months the food and service will change again. Till then, happy eating!"}
{"text":"I ago here more often than not for authentic Mexican food. It is very filling, as the portions are humongous! Make sure you are hungry."}
{"text":"My friend wanted Margaritas & Nachos. This place is just what we were looking for. It was busy when we went which we thought was a good sign.
Service was excellent. Fast & Courteous. As soon as we sat, the chips, salsa & beans where on the table. Next came water.  Then the  waiter came and was very helpful when we were deciding what to order.  I was craving fruity, so I order the large Mango Margarita & my friend ordered a large Strawberry. I like the fact that they use real fruit in there margaritas. They where large and not weak, perfect! We ordered the nachos. They where served on a very large platter drowned in real cheese w/ beans and shredded chicken. YUM!!!! There was live music & the atmosphere in the place was festive like a real mexican restaurant should be!!!! Will definitely be back to try more food & of course drink more margaritas."}
{"text":"If you get chips definitely get the guacamole and bean dip. But the must dip yo get is the white queso dip. I could just eat that alone for a meal, I always get the steak quesadilla but their fajitas are good too."}
{"text":"Good, reliable Mexican food. I've been here 2x and both times were satisfying. It's conveniently located to the First Friday festivities... and you can guarantee yourself a healthy portion of food.

The grilled fish Ranchero style was perfectly cooked. Guacamole was good with just the right amount of onions. The margaritas were a little weak though so expect to drink a few before you get a buzz.

If you come on a First Friday, expect a crazy crowd and expect that your server may be in the weeds and therefore... not so attentive. Come any other night of the month and service should be just fine.

I like this place because the crowd... and the hot summer night I just walked out of and into this restaurant.... somehow reminds me of a night at Chuy's in Austin, TX."}
{"text":"Stay away, when Groupon starts offering up discounts to sacrifice a failing business, its just not good. very expensive, luke-warm bland food Americanized for tourists."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  I'm from San Antonio so Mexican food has to be done right to impress me.  The chips came with creamy refried beans and green salsa.  Excellent.

The margarita was $4.95 at 8pm!  It was excellent.  I had the steak ranchero with jalapeños and it was pretty good.  A little too much gravy for my taste but most will love it.  This is not a place to bring your clients but the food is reasonably priced, tasty, and close to the strip.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Was having a lunch date and decided to buy a groupon for Casa Don Juan. I wasn't really expecting too much out of the food or service reading some of the most recent reviews on yelp. BUT I was pleasantly surprised! 

Before we ordered I told our lovely server that I had a groupon. There were no hiccups at all and she explained that we could order anything on the menu. 

Our food came out fresh and fast!! I couldn't believe how fast or lunch was on the table...the place was hit with a nice lunch rush and our server had everything under control. I ordered the tamale and taco combo. The tamale was just okay...the masa was a bit to thick for my liking. But nothing to gripe about. 

Also ordered a blended mango margarita. Now that was delicious! It was blended to perfection and did not have any ice chips. 

Not sure if Casa Don Juan is my favorite mexican joint to eat at but I am sure I will return."}
{"text":"This was restaurant recommended to me many times from friends and coworkers.

I was invited for lunch by a coworker and was brought here.

Walking into the restaurant you're immediately transformed into another world with all the decorations it really adds to the look and feel of the interior that's fun, festive, and makes one pause to take a moment to soak it all in.

The menu alone is just as fun with many delicious offerings.

They start us off with our drinks and chips, salsa and some refried beans!

Our meal came out much quicker than anticipated!

The portions were great, the food was incredible.

I'm now gonna jump on the bandwagon and let other people know about this place! 

Bon appetit!

:)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to this restaurant several years, and have always been happy with the service, however in the past few months, the service has declined. My last visit was horrible. I ordered the wet burrito, and was told it came with pico de gallo and guacamole. I asked to substitute chopped tomato and onion for the pico de gallo and sliced avocado for the guacamole. The waiter seemed hesitant with my substitution request, but took my order anyway. My order came with the sliced avocado, but not the tomato or onion. I talked to my waiter, and he went to get it corrected. He returned, and said that he made a mistake, the pico de gallo was not included in the burrito, so the change could not be made. I asked him to please have my order prepared the way I requested it, and to make it to go. In the meantime, my napkin fell to the floor, someone picked it up, but did not bring me a new napkin. I voiced my concern to the manager, and the best she could do was to give me 20% off.  I felt that was the final insult and have no plans to return to the restaurant.
Their food is excellent. The chefs are always consistent with the quality of the meals. 
If I do go back there, my order will be to go."}
{"text":"On this Friday night the restaurant was doing a brisk business. A good sign while the Main Street construction continues. Arriving without a reservation we were seating immediately.
Decor is like being transported to Mexico, warm and comfortable. Service was prompt. Our server Ivan was friendly and helpful. His associates also helped in removing empty dishes. 

The kitchen was busy, as there were several large groups, however wait time for drinks and food was minimal. A complementary basket of tortilla chips with 2 dipping sauces, re fried beans and salsa arrived  shortly after being seated. The chips were fresh as we could see them being made across the room. My wife ordered the Vegetarian Burrito. It was a large portion. She would have preferred more beans and less rice. I ordered the combo platter with one Chile Relleno, one Cheese Enchilada, beans and requested the spicy sauce. Great flavor from the sauce and the chile was mild. Overall a very satisfying meal."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! We came here for breakfast during our stay at the stratosphere & looked up the closest Mexican Restaurant with great reviews. Best decision! I usually judge Mexican restaurants off their Chilaquiles as a lot of restaurants do not put much effort into this dish & they were DELICIOUS! Green chilaquiles is always the way to go, they were not soggy or too crunchy they were perfect. It was \"brunch\" so we ordered some micheladas as well, very yummy as well! I love Mexican restaurants that try to stay as traditional and authentic as possible & this one was a gem!"}
{"text":"I thought I would try this restaurant again after seeing a Group-On for it... Probably have eaten here 4 times now and I just can't muster 4 stars.  In the past, I have enjoyed the margaritas but not really cared much for the food.  This last time, even the rocks margarita came out lukewarm and was unsatisfying.  The appetizer salsa isn't spicy, the appetizer beans are flavorless and the guacamole was really only tasty because of the onion in it.  My entrée was passable, as was my date's.  One positive aside form the friendly server is how fast the entrees arrived - FAST!  Overall, the portions are great too, but the food quality is on par with Macayo's - lots of cheese, but not much flavor.  If you like the food from that other restaurant (and many do) then you'll probably like the food here, but nothing about it seems particularly authentic or even vaguely interesting.  Probably will be my last visit here."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now. The food is flavorful and portions are large. Aside from the excellent entrees, the salsa, guacamole and handmade tortillas are outstanding. I like the location, a little away from the Strip yet still easy to reach. 

The staff is very friendly, unless they are busy. Maybe they don't schedule sufficient staff for the busiest times. 

So, food is terrific, service is usually timely, and staff is friendly...

I dropped a star because on my last visit we asked to move to one of two vacant booths. The hostess refused to seat us, saying they were reserved. Okay, except it was 10 minutes before anyone was seated in one of those vacant booths; and 20 minutes for the second booth. It made us feel unappreciated as customers. 

Aside from that one experience, I've always enjoyed the food and service here."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some good mexican food this past weekend and was told this was the place to check out...

Gotta say I was not disappointed!  The guacamole was yummy!!!  The portions are big and the prices are more then reasonable. My chicken burrito was great..... I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times now and every time we go we enjoy it. 

The menu is huge (almost too many choices). We've had the shrimp fajitas, chicken quesadilla, burrito, and chimichanga....all were delicious. 

Their margaritas are also very good. 

The atmosphere is fun, and the service is always good."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Servers were so attentive and fast. They were so nice and friendly. The food, AMAZING! So authentic and fresh! Great price, average $13, but such large portions.  Chips. Beans and salsa served in the beginning.  Had lunch for 25 bucks! So worth it!!"}
{"text":"They used to have Chile Colorado and it was the best. Now when I ask for it they tell me it is known by another name. No longer the best. I always ask them to put the meat and sauce in a soup container on my to go orders so it does not spill out but they can't get that right either.  I can get better at Lindo Michigan for $5 cheaper. I want to upload a photo so you can see the slop I got."}
{"text":"My yelp buddy Rachel S. and I came to check out the house that Don Juan built a few days ago.

We came in for dinner around 7 and were seated promptly. They have a small parking lot in the back which is awesome as finding parking in the area can be a problem in itself. Like most Mexcian spots, Don Juan gets props for complimentary chips and salsa but they made it even better with a side of bean dip yum!

Located right on Main Street near Charleston, Don Juan is located near the Downtown Arts District and gets packed during First Friday, They restaurant itself tries to capture that old-town Mexican feel with it's brightly colored walls, titled floors and hanging florals. The night we came in there was a mariachi band in the next room playing for diners - a nice touch. 

The menu is huge, easy to get lost in, and has pretty much every incarnation of Mexican food you could want. There specialty seems to be tamales but they have a pretty wide range of seafood offerings as well. I thought it was a little over priced, two chicken tacos with rice and beans were like $13. My  smothered carne asada burritto was ok, it looked like a giant enchiliada but was surprisingly lacking in flavor. The carne asada was very dry and the fillings could have used a bit more spice. The re-fried beans were mediocre but the Spanish style rice was pretty good. I just didn't feel like it was worth the $15 I spent, there are alot of great culinary finds in the downtown area and I feels like Casa Don Juan could do more."}
{"text":"There were a lot of problems with this place. After repeating my order three times because my waiter just couldn't get it right, my order still came out wrong. I notice the waiter struggle with taking my order so I repeated my order in Spanish (not bc I'm racist - for that person that felt the need to attack me on that) but because I had no problem being patient and making sure he got my order right. And he managed to mess up the table next to us (maybe he was new?) We went at a time that wasn't busy but felt he was all over the place but couldn't really manage to get anything right. 

How does a Mexican restaurant get Tacos so wrong? This place manages to do just that. The food itself was horrible. We came here as it was highly recommended to be the best Mex Restaurant in Vegas but were highly disappointed w the food itself. 

And to top it off we had to wait a very long time to get our check. Only reason we left a tip was for the bus boys who manages to keep up with our refills. Our waiter just took our orders, managed to screw our orders and we had to track him down for our check. (Not exaggerating - my husband had to track him down bc he neglected to come by our table to check on us) If you are looking for a decent Mex Restaurant than try to avoid this place. It sucks!





As some are offended for my review then just ignore it and go because you enjoy this place so much. I write my review based on MY experience and don't appreciate haters hating bc they don't agree. YELP is meant to voice your opinion on businesses as everyone has different experiences. 

Fortunately, I've had great Mexican food and I don't believe this was one of them. Forget about the bad service we received but the food was just not good."}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Went to Container Park for my birthday and wanted to find somewhere to eat nearby that was family friendly. The outside of the restaurant and the decor on the inside was fabulous. I was so excited. When the food arrived at the table it was horrible! Not worth the price on the menu. We were never offered a refill or even saw our waiter until the check came. My husband had to walk over and grab the pitcher of water. That's the only reason we were helped. The worst part was when the lady came over and literally started cleaning our table off when we were still eating! She grabbed the salsa and my husband had to ask her to please leave it. Then, she reached over and asked my kids to hand her their plates!! I immediately stood up and politely told her we would just leave. Horrible horrible place! Spend your money at Lindo Michoacán"}
{"text":"After a show at The Smith Center, we decided to head to Casa Don Juan since we were already downtown. We started our meal off with the complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip, which were awesome (we got seconds!). I ordered a side of guac and we all had Diet Coke. I got the chicken tacos-no lettuce, no beans. Mom got two enchiladas and my aunt went with the chicken flautas. I absolutely devoured my entire plate of food. The tortilla was perfect, and my taco didn't fall apart. The guac was fresh and delicious, making it the perfect addition to chips as well as my taco. My Mom and aunt both had a bit of food left over, but agreed that it was a good meal with excellent service. The bonus is they have pretty ample private parking for a downtown restaurant (which was a big part of our reasoning in going there). The service, food, and atmosphere were awesome. We were offered a free souvenir picture which, as a local, kind of made me chuckle. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Authentic means authentic with.... homemade flour and corn tortillas.  Best way burrito and yummy chicken in their tamales.  Wonderful prices. Nice people.  Away from hustle of strip and amazing food and people. Oh, if you like antiques then you will love location as it's near the antique shops and the ones with the great finds too. Arround 1.5 miles away from Circus Circus."}
{"text":"Coming from So Cal, my husband and I are picky about what we call Mexican food.
Casa Don Juan didn't disappoint, in fact, we make it a point to stop in for at least one meal every time we come to town.
Their salsa and fresh tortilla chips are to die for and their food is plentiful and delicious.
."}
{"text":"I love the food here. This was my 4th visit. Our waiter was awesome. Good sense of humor. We used a groupon, yessss Sir. Our waiter suggested different margaritas, my bestie had strawberry & I had a Cadillac margarita. All I can say is delicious. At the end the cashier tryed to over charge me but it was taken care of. I will be back."}
{"text":"This would probably be my second favorite mexican restaurant . Chips and salsa are fantastic and the food comes out lightning fast! I am a big fan of their tamales but I don't think you could go worn with just about any of your favorite mexican dishes from Casa Don Juan!"}
{"text":"Super yummy great place for lunch or dinner ambiance is fun the staff is amazing definitely a placed to checkout when you're downtown"}
{"text":"I would give this 5 stars except for one thing, it's only Mexican food.  How much can you dress up Mexican food...really?

The place was very clean and well decorated.  The hostesses wore beautiful traditional Mexican dresses.  We were immediately greeted and shown to our seats.  The musician/karaoke man in the corner was a bit loud, but not obnoxiously so.  He went out of his way to entertain our kids with some personal attention, a song while wearing a funny mask.  (They LOVED it!).  As a matter of fact, the entire staff were completely friendly and helpful.  Everyone went out of their way to make sure our experience was pleasant and enjoyable.  The prices were very reasonable too.

There's not much you can do with Mexican food, let's be honest.  But it was very good, as Mexican food goes.  The EXPERIENCE and customer service we were given earns Casa Don Juan 4 and a half stars in my book.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Food and A Great Place to enjoy a Ice Cold Margarita & Corona..
Very authentic decorations and the menu is so vast its quick to second guess what you wanna try. Still got great service and foos was delicious.."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.    Best Mexican in Vegas in a while.  Try a Pina colada.  It's served in a pineapple! !!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Very reasonable prices and huge menu.  Good service and fun atmosphere.  Our new favorite for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great food.... still. 
Great customer service (Gabby) .... still
Food.... maravilloso !

The energy here is just good."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place after we ate here a few days ago. Sure it may not be in the best neighborhood, and it looks sorta cheesy from the outside. But don't judge a book by its cover.

The first thing I noticed when we entered was the amount of mexican people inside. No, not just the employees, but many of the patrons. You know its a good sign if you see the ethnicity of a restaurant frequenting it. 

The chips were pretty good. Standard hard corn tortilla served with both salsa and bean dip. The dip was a bit bland but it tasted pretty pure. The salsa had plenty of flavorful salsa. Oh and the margaritas are pretty strong, which is nice I suppose. There's a woman who takes your picture and then tries to sell it back to you in a cheesy Vegas themed frame. A hilarious attempt to squeeze money out of a local.

The actual food did not disappoint. My girlfriends chimichanga was easily the best I've ever tasted.
I opted for the bistecca ranchera. It was surely the best ranchers sauce I have ever had the pleasure if eating. The steak was well prepared if not a bit chewy. The rice was excellent, as was the guacamole. The flour tortillas were fluffy wnd singed just the way  I like em. I  could see this place earning a 5 from me, but I'll have to see how they do spicy food. Final verdict is pending but current evidence shows this place is a DO."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and plentiful, our server Ivan was delightful and very knowledgeable. The Margaritas were very tasty and effective, I recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty authentic I had the carnitas and my husband had the chorizo and eggs. Service was great food came really fast it was clean!!!!!!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! The service was impeccable and the food was amazing! We ordered and got our food within 15 minutes! Great atmosphere. Located in Downtown Las Vegas - I highly recommend this restaurant! Clean, inexpensive and great quality food! They even had live music//band playing! Margaritas were also to die for! I had the cheese enchiladas and my boyfriend had the chicken tacos! His exact words \"These are the best tacos I have ever had!\""}
{"text":"Had dinner with my wife. Parking was easy. The staff welcomed us and we were shown to a booth. I had the super burrito and my wife had a taco/enchilada plate. We added two grande margaritas, but they weren't really very large. We were served quickly. The food was good, hot and filling. The staff attentive and  friendly. Most everyone working thanked us for coming in - which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"When ever someone suggests meeting here to eat I get excited because I love the food and then I quickly remember that finding a parking spot can be a pain in the ass when the lot in the back is full and you have to find somewhere along the street to park. Inside is spacious and the walls are filled with Mexican decor. This last visit the place was packed, so I thought the wait would be long, but we were seated at a half booth half table right away. Our drink orders were soon taken and our server was nice about giving us time to look over the menu. 

Chips, Bean Dip and Salsa - All complimentary and tasty. The salsa was fresh however I did favor the bean dip even though I'd have loved some cheese on top. Chips were good. 

Cheese Dip with Jalapenos ($6.50) - When the hostess sat us she asked if we wanted some cheese dip and I politely declined. When the person came to take our drink order he too asked if we wanted any cheese dip and I again politely declined. When our server asked if we wanted any cheese dip, I figured it was complimentary since we were asked 3 times if we'd like some. Wrong! Also a waste of money that could have went to a margarita instead. The cheese dip was a very small portion (same size as bean dip and salsa come in) and was not only thin and runny, but it really lacked flavor. I expected to taste some spice since It was supposed to have jalapenos in it. 

2 Enchiladas and a Taco Combo #3 ($12.99) - I chose chicken for the taco and even though the chicken tasted great there certainly could have been more of it. I requested that the enchiladas be made with flour tortillas instead of corn and they had no problem making them that way which I appreciated. There was a lot of sauce on my plate and while it did taste great, I would ask for them to go easy on it next time. The enchiladas were perfect and they didn't skimp on the cheese. The beans that accompanied the dish were very good and I liked that there was cheese on them. 

I enjoyed a few strawberry margaritas and the price especially for Downtown was on point at $6.50 each and they were not weak. If you don't want to mess with driving Downtown they do have a Summerlin location. It's worth noting that Casa Don Juan has a breakfast menu that's offered from 7 am - 11 am and they also have a kids menu."}
{"text":"I'm from Mexico City and we always looking for good food, no burritos. Food is good a lot better than Lindo Michoacan. The prices are a little expensive for my personal opinion.
Service can be better we ask for tortillas and they brought only 3 because are hand made, waitress forgot to bring more and we had to look for him.
Portions are good I recommend the Milanesa, lengua and queso con chorizo y agua de mango"}
{"text":"When I entered the restaurant, I was very impressed with the decor, and the fact that we were promptly greeted. The server brought guacamole, salsa, and bean dip to the table with fresh chips. things were looking good! 
Guac was very tasty, bean dip very tasty, but the salsa was sort of thin and bland, and seemed like it had some sort of thickening agent in it. When the entrees arrived, they were underwhelming. I had a beef enchilada, beef taco and a chile relleno. I didn't care for the sauce at all. The taco was ok. the chile relleno had too much cheese, and I didn't care for the cheese they stuffed it with. I took about three bites, and that was it. 
Service was outstanding throughout. Although the service and decor were outstanding, I didn't care for the food at all, and will probably not be back."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday and had to wait forever because a private party had booked one of their back rooms.  That was unfortunate- and we will for sure call ahead next time.  However, while we waited, Blanca (one of the hostesses) was kind and kept us informed on where were were in the line.  
When we were finally seated, we had margaritas, fajitas, carne asada, and tacos.  The food was A-OK.  
Our service was good and our food was good.  What more can you ask for??"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I started out chowing down on the homemade refried beans & guac. These beans were almost as good as my Nicaraguan mama makes. I was surprised to see that they had carne asada because I can no longer find carne asada @ mexican resturants nowadays. This place is a must!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! The service is always great and very welcoming and the food overall is always good. Like any restaurant they have a few things that stand out. Their Chile Colorado is amazing! The enchiladas verdes with chicken are very goods I know standard but none the less very good. I would though highly recommend the Chile colorado or just my go to place. They are also great for brunch as they have a nice bar that keeps the margaritas flowing.  They make fresh tortillas which just adds to the taste and experience."}
{"text":"Love Casa Don Juan!! Great Food, greaf service and Ivan was great!  I will be coming back! Also, Ivan, thank you for the history behind the paintings of Frida! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch at the Art District. What a great experience. Best Mexican food I have had in the 10+ years I have lived here."}
{"text":"love the food, the service and the atmosphere downtown.  Tried the new location in summerlin, it was horrible...the food was terrible, the music too loud, the atmosphere cold and like a fast food eatery.  Our food was cold and had to send it back twice, finally gave up and just took it home and heated it up.  it's not the same as the downtown cooks.  Don't go to that location.   Sadly as its closer to where we might go more often."}
{"text":"Always a good stop before or after First Friday. 
They usually have a live band, which is entertaining. 

Try the Cadillac Margarita with Patron.

Yuuuum."}
{"text":"After the issues we had with the Groupon, the Owners Son (Billy) reached out to me (us) and we had a good productive talk.  We were invited back to the restaurant after getting an email from Billy.  The staff was wonderful and Billy cares about the restaurant.  The food is always good and yes we will be back again.

Thank you for stepping up and addressing the issues, with the manager and Groupon.

Sincerely,

Mark Habersack"}
{"text":"Wow. First time at the new location on buffalo...
Billy and Saul killed it tonight with service by the bar. Food was incredible!! We WILL be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious horchata and an encilada dish made my night. Fresh, housemate salsa and excellent service. The only thing I didn't like was that the qua smoke was shiny and slimy, not chunky."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to in Vegas. I liked the bean dip they served with the chips and salsa. I had a pork tamale and chili relleno. Both were good. My boyfriend had a really good pork torta. The ambiance was great and service, prices were reasonable (inexpensive when it came to the torta) and service was at attentive. The restaurant is located in a funky part of town with cute and quirky vintage shops that are worth strolling past afterwards as your food settles."}
{"text":"I've been to Casa a few times.  It's solid Mexican food with a good ambiance.  On the Friday night I went they had a live singer performing so that was a nice touch.  It was packed but we were seated quickly and served within five minutes of placing our order. Their menu is incredibly extensive with the typical combo plates you find at most Mexican places.  My first time having a Torta.  Mexican sandwich as described by the waiter.  No idea I had been missing out.  It was good and I didn't leave filling stuff like I usually do after a heavy Mexican meal."}
{"text":"My friends and I (a party of about 9) went for dinner last night and experienced a few things.

* There's very limited parking. The parking they do have is unlit and in a bad area of town. Definitely thought my car was going to get broken into because I had to park in a dark alley.

* Waitstaff is more than a little pushy. Especially the guy that walks around trying to sell you an overpriced photo he took of your party. Not hospitable at all.

* Portions were generous, but the food was mediocre. Our waiter even said that Lindo Michoacan had better food.

* 3 of the members of my party wanted more sauce to put on their burritos and tamales. The server brought out 3 portions of green sauce, but failed to inform us that sides of sauce were $3 EACH. When I saw an extra $9 added to our bill, I politely asked if they could remove the charge. I was told that wasn't possible so politely asked to talk to a manager. She also told us that it wasn't possible to take the charge off, even though we weren't notified when we ordered. 

For putting the business ahead of their customer, Casa Don Juan has lost a customer."}
{"text":"Too full to even write about it!! I need a nap! Everything was super awesome ! Just come out and try it !!

We hadn't been back since the last time we ate there 9 months ago, we're closer the to the one on Buffalo, so last night we took some friends who had never been there , we spoke highly of the restaurant food and service only to be disappointed with the service the waiter's  attitude was crappy, he rarely checked on us we were running dry on drinks and he barely came around . When we were finished he didn't even bother picking up our plates we had to stack them up  before he realized he should pick them up.. 

As for the food , that receives 5 *****, it didn't fail us... our friends were impressed with the food and said they'll try the one on Buffalo .. the CDJ on Buffalo has an awesome waiter and I wish I could remember his name, when we dine there we look for him to sit in his section .."}
{"text":"Sorry John, your house looks very traditional, but thats about it. Your food was very far from authentic and sadly dissappointing.

disguised by waitstaff dressed in traditional clothing and abuelita making tortillas a mano(like nasty Lindo Michoacan(barf sound)

John's House builds your anticipation up only to let you down in the end.
So we got the Guacamole to start, Wifey ordered the Mole de Pollo and I ordered the Chile Relleno/Chicken Enchilada combination plate.

Guacamole-The version that I whipped up at The Yelpmazing Race in under a minute tasted better, and Horchata is from the machine, not homemade.

Chile Relleno-one of my benchmarks for authenticity, no stringy, cheesy goodness, but a weird brown(overcooked?) firm cheese that had a texture like a VERY firm tofu in a barely in-tact chile held by a bunch of toothpicks, very disappointing.(How bout a throwdown Bobby Flay Style?)Enchilada was aight.

Chicken Mole-We're expecting bone-in chicken pieces, but instead, fricken chicken fajita strips double as the meat for the Mole. Even worse,
the spice, sweetness, and smokiness from the sauce tastes kinda off with a tanginess like a barbecue sauce!?!?!

Unfinished entrees, and totally dissappointed, a strong fishy odor permeated the dining room from a fried fish that was being delivered to the table next to us(feel sorry for that next victim)
It was time for us to say adios for good....ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"I had one of the best fish dishes ever at this restaurant.  It was served plank style, a whole fish, absolutely delicious.  The Mexican food is close to authentic, with rustic elements and more seafood than what you might associate with Mexican fare, though I'm told that is the real deal.  The rice and beans were scrumptious. Only downside might be getting a table during peak times and parking on the street.  Worth it if you are hankering for Mexican fare and are downtown."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! I would have given it 5 stars because I really enjoyed our first visit. The food was fantastic! The service was friendly, prompt, and attentive even though it was a busy night. Unfortunately the female waitresses we had on our next two visits seemed to be annoyed about having to serve us.

If we ever go back, we'll request Walter and leave the kids at home. They charge too much for the kids in my opinion anyway. They seem to be discouraging families from dining there and with food as good as they serve they can probably afford to alienate us."}
{"text":"Casa Don Juan is such a great Mexican place to come and eat. The theme inside of the restaurant makes you feel like if you're in Mexico. It is so colorful and bright. The food here is maravilloso! The servers are all friendly and nice. I've been here multiple of times and have not had a bad experience here. They bring the food to you fast and if they don't, then that's because they're cooking it really well for you to have. Trust me, this place is really good if you're looking for a great Mexican restaurant to eat at :)"}
{"text":"We came in with a large group and needed to get our baseball team back with in an hour. The hostess was very accommodating.   They took our boys order first and they were done on time! They were willing to split the bill after we ordered. DID I mention the Food was amazing! The chips salsa and beans was a perfect way to start of the meal. Will defiantly make it a point to stop by any time we r in Vegas!! Ohhhh and the HOMEMADE TORTILLAS!!! WOW!!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. My only complaint is that the Pollo Ranchero available as the lunch special on Wednesday isn't on the regular menu. I would order it every time if I could."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon so I decided to stop by and have lunch. The service was pretty good. Attentive and knowledgeable. My food came out amazingly quick which was awesome. As for the food, everything was good. Sadly that's about as far as I can go with it. The salsa for the chips was watery. No onion, tomato or much of anything to be honest. When it came to the guacamole... it seemed like it had been put through a blender. Perhaps I like my guacamole and salsa on the chunky side so to each their own. The chicken mole was once again good but not great. For fifteen dollars a person I would rather eat like a king at a mom and pop Mexican restaurant where there's a little more grease and a lot more flavor.

Overall I feel like this is a very refined (bland) Mexican restaurant. Their food is good but by no means amazing. Then again a lot of people tell me how delicious Robertos is... So I guess if that passes for authentic Mexican to some people then I can definitely see how people would be blown away by this place."}
{"text":"Food is great I bought a Groupon for 20 bucks =40 bucks it was good they have a guy come to your table and take a picture says its free and you know Yeah right you just decline it when he comes back and you still get a small picture w/ their information etc all on it. But overall this place had great margaritas and food Great Fast service I would definately return If you get the groupon plan on paying at least an additional 10 bucks not including tip for 2 people!!"}
{"text":"Bland Bland Bland! Service was good but food and drinks (mojito) were bland!!! We went to have a date night at Casa Don Juan and sadly my husband and I were disappointed, coming from San Diego and spoiled by amazingly authentic Mexican food; nothing here had any flavor. From the salsa for the chips (it had heat) beans were bland and if you order a tamale, that is exactly what you get a steamed tamale with nothing and hardly any meat. My husband had the chimichanga platter and it was bland boiled chicken fried in a tortilla. The mojito taste like lime juice over ice... Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I was very displeased with my experience here. My mother and I were assured by the staff that they could accommodate our celiacs disease, but we ended up getting severely ill. The waitstaff essentially ignored us despite the restaurant being nearly empty, and our food was cold by the time it got to us. I would not suggest this place for the gluten sensitive: you will become ill."}
{"text":"I felt right at home walking though these doors!
Great Atmosphere 
Delicious food 
Food served in a timely manner 
Courteous staff
And the price is definitely right!! I have recommended this oasis to all of my friends both in and out -of-towners. 
Definitely 5 star worthy!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So far, the best Mexican food I have had in Las Vegas.  I go to Casa Don Juan's whenever I get the chance, which is not often as it is located in very seedy downtown.  In an area of less than sightly individuals and bail bonds offices (which should tell you something) this place is a gem.  I have had numerous items on the menu and I keep coming back to the Carnitas, not only because I am a huge pork fan, but they do it right here.  The pork is always very flavorful and fork tender; it comes served with rice, beans, pico de gallo and guacamole.  The tortillas and guacamole are made in house, as well as the salsa and they are all excellent.  I thoroughly enjoy the food at Casa Don Juan and the only thing I would change is the location."}
{"text":"Sizzling fajitas are a must! The portions are huge for the price so you could probably split them. I typically order shrimp and let me tell you, they do not skimp on the meat! My other favorite dish is their fajita salad and I LOVE the sweet tamale [drool emoji]. I originally tried this place because my friend's family runs it and it's a convenient distance from my work. I have to say I've scored. On top of that their service is wonderful from the second you come in the door. I've always had a great experience but this round Ivan was an absolute pleasure to have as server. 

Local recommended!"}
{"text":"The thing I love about this place is that there are so many options with room for modification. I will admit that I'm a picky eater and this restaurant is always willing to modify it's dishes to fit my needs. The staff is great and for the prices these dishes go for, the value can't be beat.  Appetizers like the Salsa, Pico De Gallo, and Beans are always there right after you sit down and ordering is an easy process because the servers are always very knowledgeable about the food on the menu.   There's also a guitar player who plays tunes for the customers and happily takes requests from the audience.  Every time I go there though I want to tune his guitar cause it's waaaaaaaay out of tune haha... maybe it's supposed to be that way I'm not sure.  Kidding aside, it's always nice to hear a song or two while we eat.  Service and food are both exemplary here and definitely recommend Casa Don Juan to everyone.  Two words: Chile Rellenos... 'nuf sed!"}
{"text":"This place does not rank high on my list of Mexican food, even though the staff is Hispanic, the food seems to not have the flair. I ate here several times during my stint in Las Vegas, but I must admit to me it did not hit the spot.

The sauce was horrible, reminded me more of spaghetti O's and not authentic Mexican food. The service is good for the most part, depending on the demand of the customers, there could be some serious waiting on a refill of coke.

I do not think there is much else I can say about this place at this time, I am giving three stars based on my experiences, and the food."}
{"text":"the best mexican food in las vegas. wow"}
{"text":"I first must say that in the last few months they changed their pricing on their menus.  I am EXTREMELY disappointed to find out that taking my family of four used to be around $40-45 with tip with 4 plates and water for each of us.  Now it's $60-$70 for the four of us for the same 4 plates and water for each of us.  My wife's plate used to be $8.99 for one taco, one enchilada, rice and beans.  Now it's $13.99 for the same plate!!!  Really Don Juans, it's necessary to charge it up $5 extra dollars for ONE plate?  I live in Henderson and would trek up to the north side of the strip for this and let's just say, NOT ANY MORE!!!  Very disappointed Don Juans, very disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"food was really great and service was good. would give it a 3.7 if I could  only thing negative was that our rice wasn't fully cooked"}
{"text":"After hitting the Frankie's Tiki Bar near by, we were looking for a good place to eat.  Being from Hawaii, we don't get a lot of authentic Mexican food - so we were happy to give this place a try based on the Yelp reviews.
Prices were good - compared to Hawaii - and the plate sizes were giant.  I wish restaurants would make smaller plates and smaller prices!  Guac was very yummy!
Only reason this doesn't rate higher is due to the servers.  We were asked if we wanted Guac with a chips and we said yes.  However, it didn't show up and we had to ASK for it!  Then the drinks never got refilled and water never came.  
We are used to crappy service in Hawaii but this was pretty bad.
I'd come here again, but I'd split a plate with someone and not expect the service to be spot on."}
{"text":"Delicious! I've been searching for authentic Mexican cuisine since I moved here. This is it. The best!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and we are here at least once a week, sometimes twice!

The food is delicious, service is great, portions and price are good. The only complaint some might have is parking, as it is free but limited spaces nearby... but I can walk from my office ;)

They have daily specials served with soup. I love the tacos, enchiladas, tamales, and chicken fajitas. We always ask for our favorite server Ivan, but the whole staff take great care of us when we are in. We usually take half back to the office for leftovers. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Awesome tamales, this place is legit.  I tried the cheese and jalepeno one, it was awesome.  I also had the cheese enchilada with rice and beans, also awesome.  The enchilada sauce is noteworthy.

The free chips and salsa come with green salsa and beans.  Beans!  They know the key to my heart.

Vegetarians have the normal options - cheese enchiladas, cheese tamales, vegetarian burrito, tostadas.

Prices are normal for a Mexican restaurant, my two-item combo was $12.99, but the tamale combos are more expensive.  Two enchilada combos were $9.99.

Service was fast and friendly, I will definitely go here again if I am in Vegas and craving Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is nasty the beans rice are dry can't believe people are still coming here there's no flavor on the food I was so hungry that I  just ate half of the plate the prices are ridiculous I rather go to Chapala is decent prices and it's good and  better taste there horchata is $3.50 with no refill that is so crazy Will never come back again not even if they give it to me for free .
And there's a guy on Sunday that is taking pictures saying that it's a free picture but later comes back and tries to sell it for $20 dollars this place is ghetto half a star"}
{"text":"This is another great spot for mexican food.

Food here is defiantely above average and the service is what Vegas used to be about.

In the past I have had Tamales, Enchiladas (Verde was tge best IMO), Chile Relleno and all were very good. Very wide array of tequilas for you to punish your liver with and they know how to break out a margarita.

All in all this is a great spot....but I cannot give it 5 stars because you can still sense that little bit of quality that gets left out in high volume joints."}
{"text":"Hands down this is my favorite place to get Carnitas!!! They are AMAZING!!! I absolutely love their Cadillac Margaritas!!! YUMMY!!! When I have friends/family visit me from out of town, I always take them here.  Everyone loves it!!! I'm definitely a loyal patron!!!"}
{"text":"I rarely do any yelp reviews but The service here was absolutely horrible, everyone was so rude to our table we had to switch waiters. Even the hostess was extremely rude when we told her we found a phone in the restroom she didn't even care. The food was amazing but the service makes me never want to go back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Very pleased with this place. I heard mixed reviews but we had a great experience here. Bright pastel colors gave it a south of the border feel - a stark contrast to the grunge of Main St outside.
Parking was decent, small lot but we had no problem finding a spot. Excellent service, the food was awesome. Tecate beer came in a can, unopened with a lime on top. 
The chips were a little bland though, but the salsa was good and had a nice kick to it and the bean dip was good too.
We had the chicken tacos and beef enchiladas and it was awesome. The rice was really good too. Much better then I've had elsewhere around town. 
Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"Should have listened to yelp reviewers. With a 30 minute wait, we mistakenly assumed the food would be fantastic and authentic Mexican cuisine. We were wrong. 

The hostess seated us and asked if we'd like to start with chips and guacamole. We agreed and she said they'd be right over. They came after our meal. Not exactly my idea of dessert. 

Both meals were spotty at best. His fajitas were bland and the steal was chewy, evidence of frozen meat and overall lack of care. My meal was clearly reheated as the sauce was cold in some spots and piping hot in others. It seems as though they are more concerned in turning tables than producing quality food. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Las Vegas. Too bad I went with my ex so many times, or else I'd frequent Casa alot more. Fajitas are top notch, salsa could use a little more substance. Good service and parking is never an issue."}
{"text":"This restaurant has amazing Customer Service. The food is delicious. We come from LA just to have their Pozole. Beautiful decor."}
{"text":"local first timer:  great environment, excellent service with welcoming employees. huge fan of margaritas, glad to have come across this fabulous place. will surely be returning in the near future"}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years. Food is great but getting sick and tired of this place trying to Nickel and dime you for everything that other restaurants give for free.  This tactic is getting so bad there it's time to start looking for other places. 

On a recent visit they tried to charge us extra for a side of red salsa.!!! Unbelievable..... then when I asked for a menu adjustment for eggs, the charged me an extra $4 dollars when it was served on a breakfast menu for free.  Really Casa Don Juan, charge your customers for a side of red salsa...????? U get all you want for free and Taco Bell...!!!!!  Come one management.!!  U guys are making a ton of money there so what's going on???? You guys getting taxed by El Chapo still or what..!!!! Stop being so damn foolish..!!"}
{"text":"Over the years I have past this place 1000's of times.  I finally had the opportunity to eat there yesterday and it was a big disappointment.

We arrived a little early and decided to have a Beer and much on some Chips & Salsa while waiting for a friend to arrive.  We also ordered a side of Guacamole to go with it.  The Chips & Salsa were ok and the Guacamole was ok.  The Chips didn't taste fresh and there was a bunch of mashed up small pieces at the bottom of the basket, which normally means we got an older batch and had the last basket before they prepared fresh chips.....Strike 1.

When my friend finally arrived, it took forever for the server to come by and take our order.  At first we didn't realize how long it was because we had a couple of Beers to hold us over, but after a while we began to notice that it was taking a long time.  I had to flag her down after waiting for 15 minutes.....Strike 2.

I ordered the Beef Fajitas & 1 of their Jalapeno & Cheese Tamales.  They are known for their Tamales, so I was excited to have an opportunity to try one.  The food came out pretty fast, but they didn't bring my Tamale and they didn't bring a friend's entree.  We waited for the food....they brought out my friend's entree, but forgot my Tamale.  I was too busy eating my Fajitas and didn't notice until I was 1/2 way through my food....I mentioned it to the waitress and she said she'd be right back with it.  Meanwhile, the Beef Fajitas were ok.....the flavor wasn't as robust as I would like them to be.....and the meat wasn't up to par.  It wasn't good quality steak in my opinion.

Everyone finished their food and the conversation was so good that I forgot about my Tamale until my friend brought it to my attention.....damn, by that point I didn't even want it.  So I mentioned it to the waitress.....she apologized, but it didn't seem sincere.

We had a couple more Beers after lunch and when they brought the check, I saw the freakin' Tamale on the bill!  What the hell?!  Strike 3!

At that point, I didn't care anymore and since the Tamale was only $3 I paid the damn bill and we left.

Overall, I was disappointed with the service and the food quality.

Will I return?  Not a chance."}
{"text":"Love this place downtown. Great Mexican food, great authentic feel in decor. Food is super food. Just went with a Groupon for lunch entrees. Service was good & efficient. Tried cheese enchiladas & carne asada taco with beans. Friend had 2 tacos plate with rice & beans. Both awesome! Chips & salsa to start are complimentary & yummy!"}
{"text":"It's my favorite Mexican place in LV, it's far from the strip and in the downtown area so not sure if you'll wonder here if you're new in town. The restaurant is near the Las Vegas North Outlet.

I like the rice mix with beef, I forgot which one it is, but every time I'm there I just ask for it.  Plenty of parking at the back of the restaurant and it gets crowded in the afternoon, all the locals come here for lunch."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. The food was delicious and well priced. Fun environment and authentic Mexican food. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Our team from work came here before an event for some breakfast and it was alright. I wasn't blown away but I did enjoy it. Their home-made tortillas were delightful but I didn't think my Huevos Rancheros were all that great, otherwise. The sauce on top was somewhat bland and the eggs were overcooked (for being over medium).

I tried my boyfriend's Chile relleno and I didn't like the cheese inside. He said he liked them but he's had better. I just wasn't that impressed by the whole meal. The waitress was awesome so we did appreciate that. Also, the fresh-squeezed lemonade was great. I would definitely get that again. 

In the end though, I probably won't come back to pay $10 for a dish I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"Love the place. Great food, great decor'. Friendly. Great location for First Friday. Nothing better on a lazy day then pictures of Frida, beef burrito and Dos XX"}
{"text":"Best damn Mexican food in Las Vegas , been to many others all over Vegas . But Don Juan beats them all by a mile . The people are nice the food is great and lots of parking ! . Prices are not bad ,maybe they can give you a bit more food but its good . I love it"}
{"text":"After eating at Casa Don Juan, I will never waste my money eating Mexican food on the Las Vegas Strip or at a Casino again!!!!  Instead, I will Uber it to Casa Don Juan and have a outstanding Mexican meal.

I took my family to Casa Don Juan in July 2016, and we all loved our meal and experience.  

The restaurant is located about 1 mile from the Downtown Fremont street.  From the Strip is was a $6 Uber ride, and worth the ride.

The restaurant has a great old school decor and ambience.  There is a lot of Frida Kahlo pictures and art on the walls.

The service was fantastic, very friendly, professional and helpful.

After being seated you are given free chips, salsa and bean dip.  Something that you have to pay extra for at all the Mexican restaurants on the Strip.  The Chips and dips are very good.

The margaritas are large, delicious and you can tell they put a fair amount of tequila in the drinks.    The margaritas are about $10.

The food tasted delicious and fresh.  Everyone loved they way their meal tasted.  The portion size was perfect.  Enough to fill you up, but not make you sorry you ate the last bite.

The prices were very reasonable, especially when considering the quality and portion size.  You'll get so much more for your money, compared to restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip.  Our bill was about $75 for four dinners, 2 margaritas, and desert.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I will definitely be having dinner at Casa Don Juan.  I would also encourage all of my family and friends to enjoy this great restaurant."}
{"text":"The salsa here is to die for! We come here all of the time and have never had a bad experience. Ivan is an excellent server and has amazing customer service! Recommend to everyone:)"}
{"text":"Went today based on yelp reviews. Very busy but got seated within 20 minutes. Lots of friendly staff, great chips, salsa and bean dip. We ordered chicken fajitas which were pretty good. My problem is, you get TWO tortillas. We asked for more and were charged $1.50. Really??"}
{"text":"We had never been here before, but it's seriously all anyone talks about when you mention you'd like to grab some Mexican. We were walking through the Arts District and there it was - so we figured, why not?

Why not....is the question I ask when I realize we've wasted 3 years NOT eating here! This place is awesome! You can sit inside or out, your preference, and inside is fantastically bright, vibrant, and energetic. The waitstaff is QUICK. 'Let me get you a drink' 'Here are your complimentary chips, salsa and beans' 'What can I get you today?' They are speedy and friendly, and wonderful. A man even came over and took a complimentary photo of us...of which he then tried to sell us extra copies - we declined - but it was fun to have a Valentine's Day pic of us at a random Mexican joint :) 

The menu is intense - so try to either use a Yelp review ahead of time or at least have some clue as to what you're looking for before cracking it open. There are bright colorful photos that represent what the food looks like - and it actually does. ...and the photos aren't repulsive - which is a bonus!

I'm telling you for real, that within 5 minutes of ordering, our food was at the table. I had enough time to check into Yelp and ask my husband what he thought of the place and our food arrived. I was honestly shocked. The waiter said it oftentimes surprises him. The food was great. I got the #9 which was 3 chicken floutas, rice and beans. The floutas were HOT - yes, like they were just prepared. Crispy tortilla and succulent chicken with a kick - I didn't want to stop eating them, alas they disappeared quickly. The. rice. was. amazing. So delicious!! And guys - I do not like refried beans...except I ate all of them on this day. Yes. They were awesome! My husband got 2 chicken tacos, rice and beans and he nearly licked his plate. He kept saying over and over that he would definitely be returning to consume more food. ...and when Mikey's happy, Brooke is happy. 

The bill only ran us $28.10 - I think that's pretty legit for a delicious meal that we couldn't find anything wrong with. We'll definitely be back, and can't wait to try the margaritas cuz they looked b o m b."}
{"text":"Finally, a great option for good food close to the Strip that's not a chain or fancy-pants casino restaurant!

I shared a Saturday afternoon lunch with my dad and grandmother and we all were impressed with the quality, flavor and portion sizes we received!  The wait staff was happy to bring my dad a bowl of their hottest sauce, as he didn't think the regular salsa that came with the chips and beans was hot enough.

My carnitas was tender and juicy, served with guacamole and lime alongside of some of the best spanish rice I've had.  My dad proclaimed the chorizo in his huevos con chorizo to be very flavorful - he said it wasn't spicy at all, but he can't be believed in that.  The tortillas that accompanied our entrees were obviously very fresh and hand-made.

The service was friendly, but could have been a tad more attentive.  Lunch for three with coffee and tea, plus a dessert to-go was $41.  All in all, no complaints - and I'll definately be bringing friends and family back to Casa Don Juan."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the worst restaurant I've been to so far the worst customer service! Me and my boyfriend were on vacation this past weekend and I decided to buy the 2 lunch entrees (up to $10.99 each) on Groupon I love Groupon they always have amazing deals anyways so me and my boyfriend had never been to LV so that's why we decided to buy that Groupon special. We start heading to the restaurant first of all I'm going to start off by the location is dangerous so much crime and just really sketchy and dangerous in general, so we go inside kindly ask the hostess that we had purchased a Groupon special & if we could take out instead of dining in we didn't want to be there too long since the location was very dangerous & the hostess rudely said no so I said okay that's fine I don't like being rude or disrespectful so I said never mind we will just dine in and they rudely sat us down never asked for our drink nothing they sent like 4 different servers because I guess nobody wanted to be our server they were all rude as soon as we mentioned the Groupon special we had purchased left & never came back to our table! Finally another different server came by and asked for our drink 30min later & the same thing happened when I mentioned the Groupon special he left never came back and I'm Latina so I understand Spanish and I over heard all of the servers  judging us, talking about how we wanted our food for free and we were broke when I had showed all of the our Groupon voucher and nobody has a right to tip if you feel like they aren't doing they're job as an employee! We wouldn't go to a damn restaurant knowing we don't have money like it's common sense I'm not stupid they were making fun saying oh im not serving them \"cheap assholes\" just being really disrespectful and judgmental for no reason so my boyfriend and I got up walked out really upset and disappointed & I'm not over exaggerating or being an ass because Ive worked the restaurant industry for over 4 years so I know how to be a server, host, and manager and let me tell you this restaurant does not know how to run a business! I don't even know how they are still in service I'm very disappointed! My first time in LV was the worst experience ever! Don't recommend this restaurant at all!!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, never spend your money here busboy dropped dirty utensils on my clothes  bad service all around server was rude"}
{"text":"very nice flavors and fast, friendly service.  the only thing that keeps me from not enjoying lunch at casa don juan more often is the lack of a decently priced lunch menu."}
{"text":"We came here looking forward to celebrating my husbands birthday instead we have the most horrible service. The only lady that was nice was the lady taking \"free\" photos. The food was simply ok. It was way over priced. We could have drove 2miles up Charleston to a whole in the wall restaurant with better service and better quality food!"}
{"text":"We went to Mundo tonight only to find it's not open on Mondays.  Duh to me for not checking hours in advance.  Plan B - go to Casa Don Juan.  We had two very enjoyable meals.

My gringa wife had a plain chicken breast with refried beans.  I had the chicken in mole.  Both were good.  My mole sauce was very flavorful.  It was rich with diverse elements that made it a complex and very tasty dish.

While there, a nice gentleman played guitar and sang including Speedy Gonzales.  It was a good meal and a fun evening.

I can't wait to go back to try the tongue tacos."}
{"text":"Great food , great service. It's a great spot for celebrations. Very well trained staff."}
{"text":"Huge tamales that tasted sooooo good. Even the beans and rice were tasty. Definitely worth the price and trip."}
{"text":"Good food.  Great shrimp tacos!  Gauc is delicious!  
Service during lunch can be slow and you may have to beg for your check.

Biggest plus: I saw President Clinton there when he was in town campaigning for Hillary.  I turned into a giggling girl and all I got out was Hello, Mr. President."}
{"text":"Service was horrific today.

Got skipped over in seating
Kids meal wasn't brought out until towards the end
Reguested chips and beans were delivered 
Extra plates and utensils were brought out
Extra tortillas were not mixed as requested
Water was NEVER refilled 

...but the food was excellent 
Unfortunate that they think that their food is so good that they can provide such poor service. There were plenty of servers to provide service. Poor management"}
{"text":"This review is for my winter visits!  I would come here just for their 7 seas soup during the cold winter days and it is refreshing and warming.  

I like the live music they have wandering around sometimes.  

In the past though, I've had their nacho appetizer and a breaded filet fish dish.  They were alright, some times on the menu were costly but at the same time I'd pay 14 buckaroo's for this seven seas soup.  Ahh, love the soup more than anything!"}
{"text":"This joint is super cute. Fun ambiance and decor. The service was A-OK, and the food was meh. 

I ordered a 2 tamale combo. The menu description led me to believe the tamales would have a sauce. They didn't, and they desperately needed it. They were dry. 

I may go again to try a different dish but was not impressed with the food on my initial visit. 

In addition, harassment by scary downtown people in the parking lot makes frequenting this place less than likely."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband on a Friday morning 4/4/14 
The place was easy to find from the strip ,love the Mexican feel and look.  it was pretty empty fast service and very friendly waiter he was really attentive to what we needed. the bean dip and salsa are really good I shared a tostada de camaron with my husband that was delish, i got a plate of camarones a la diabla a good amount of spicy if you dont eat spicy food i dont recommend My husband got caldo de camaron he loved it i had a taste very flavorful . We also got hand made tortillas that were great reminded me of my grandmas cooking i def recommend but is a little pricey but for the great service and food its a steal"}
{"text":"Overall I definitely recommend. Friendly staff, good food, pretty quick service. I do agree with people saying the jalapeño cheese dip is too small for the price but it's really good! I think that would be my only complaint. Other than that would definitely recommend, my 2nd time going and will definitely come next time I visit"}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate breakfast here this morning and have never been so disappointed when eaten here in the past. We were seated close to the bar and were brought water immediately. Our server was great and were able to sit and soak in the history that they offer here. It is so nostalgic and after ordering it is better to soak in the authenticity of our surroundings than play on the phone. 

When our food arrived we I did my happy dance inside since I was so hungry. My daughter and I both ordered the burrito de machaca, which is shredded beef, egg, pico, and beans. It was so mouthwatering. Their shredded beef is so good here cooked to perfection, but I had them add cheese to the inside of the burrito since everything is better with cheese. I was charged for the extra cheese but it makes everything better."}
{"text":"This is what Mexican restaurants looked like when I had my first meal in one in the 70s.  We came twice for breakfast.  I had the machaca and it was great.  The second time the waiter suggested carnitas machaca which was also great.  Guacamole was delicious, coffee was good, there is a lady there making fresh tortillas in front of you and they made me jalapanos toreados.  Loved the room, ambience and service.  Cheap for vegas.   Fun and highly recommended - at least for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Usually get really good service but tonite it was horrible. We had a Groupon so maybe that's why the waitress treated us like crap. Had to ask for water THREE times and when the check came she said we had to pay up front at the register which was never the case in the past. While at the register, two other waiters came up with money/credit cards for other customers to settle their bills for them. 

The food was good as always and the margaritas were yummy as well (although I asked for NO salt on the rim but got salt anyway). Unfortunately the waitress was so bad that I'll think twice about coming here again. There are other good Mexican restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are the best I've had in Las Vegas.  The salsa is obviously homemade, very spicy and lots of fresh cilantro floating around in it.  I could have done without the bean dip.  

I had a wet chicken burrito (I feel pervy just typing that).  The burrito was pretty huge and the green sauce had a very spicy kick.  Well worth the $7.99 price tag.  I had so much chips and salsa that the burrito had to go back to the office with me. 

Service was great.  Everyone is very friendly and a couple of different servers checked in on us.  Parking was crazy because apparently everyone downtown eats lunch here at noon.  Thankfully, there is plenty of street parking.  Just bring a couple of quarters in case you have to use a meter."}
{"text":"The freshest, hottest food!!!! Drinks are on point. Not many authentic Mexican restaurants, but Casa Don Juan is ORIGINAL!"}
{"text":"The service here sucks, if you ask for something they suggest something else... I recommend ordering directly from the menu, Nothing can be custom made, or made to order, and our Waitress Angelica was rude, and not welcoming at all. The only fresh thing about this place is the fresh waters."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Always greeted warmly by Raul or his staff. I prefer to eat ethnic food where the ethnics eat, from Italian to Greek to Mexican. This is THE Mexican Restaurant for me."}
{"text":"Weekend to Las Vegas Auto Drive from Arizona. I'm not feeling too good but my wife insisted I get handmade tortillas. How can I say no. She found this place on Main Street so we decided to check it out. We showed up about 12 o'clock and it was packed. Wasn't long to for us to be seated and our waiter Ivan introduced himself with a big smile then quickly begin serving. We got guacamole to start off with your chips and salsa dawn good. But more than anything I could smell the hand made  tortillas being made in the back. We got our food and again our lunch. Absolutely great. Ordered two sides of flour tortillas which did not last long and ordered another to go. Authentic Mexican food is what they have here. Good job Ivan keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good home on the wall Mexican Restraunt and this one fills the bill. Excellent food, fantastic service. My only complaint was the north dining room was very hot. Not sure If the A/C failed or what but it Ess way to hot. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"We ordered cheese dip as soon as we sat down. By time it arrived we still hadn't seen our server, had to ask bus person for water. We were almost finished with cheese dip when our server finally arrived. We probably
waited 10 minutes for someone to greet us, when he did he seemed rushed, I think he was in a different part of the restaurant. When we ordered drinks he had a tough time understanding the wine I wanted  \"Chardonnay\" so I pointed to menu. I told him we had a groupon upfront incase they wanted to see it first as some places do. I knew the Fajitas #24 were enough for two so I told him we were going to split it. He proceeds to tell us NO you can't do that you have to have two entrees!! (Yes I knew we had to spend $37.50 to use the groupon). Ok we will order another dish. BF ordered Cam Mojo de Ajo, shrimp cooked in garlic. Food arrived quickly. Our drinks are almost gone by now. 
My Fajitas had absolutely no flavor what-so-ever, the chicken was very dry. Very disappointed as my girlfriend had them before and they were delish! The #24 shrimp dish was served with shells and legs still on. The garlic seemed like the jarred type, not fresh. Plus normally sautéed shrimp isn't cooked with shells on. It was overpowering with garlic. Drinks empty now. Stick with water. We saw our waiter 3 far and between times. When he gave us check it put it on the table and left. After waiting to pay him, we took it to the front. Would have been nice had he told us! 
Not going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, drink and serves. Jesus Barrugh is by far the best server every. Ask for him, he knows a lot on out the menu and will recommend something great. Homemade tortillas, salsa, bean dip, guacamole and chips."}
{"text":"There are just not enough stars...purchased on Groupon...no problems to use but did have to pay $2 bucks extra for the Cadillac Margarita. The food DELICIOUS! Everything is homemade even the tortillas both corn and flour. Great customer service. Noticed they have way too many employees but that is what set them apart, they all seemed happy and willing to help each other. We went back for breakfast and again were pleased. If you go to Vegas you have to stop by and eat, I know we will. We even got a free photo."}
{"text":"WOW! 
Él profesionalismo, 
La amabilidad, 
La sonrisa del personal,
El servicio al cliente,
La comida en general
Aurelia, meseros y todos, GRACIAS por tanta atención y permitirnos pasar un tiempo maravilloso en Casa Don Juan. 
RECOMENDADO 100%
Nos vemos pronto!!!"}
{"text":"food is most def, authentic,pricey costs the same when we eat at cheesecake factory exxcept you dont get that exceptional service, the last yr we had pretty decent service, this yr, ws horrible, mgr, guy had a attitude, waiter had difficulty communicating just kept agreeing with me, customer service has definitely changed everywhere,"}
{"text":"roaches? on the wall crawling while eating? and they got an a? yes!! disgusting .....and the management here is horrible she did NOT want to listen to what we had to say very unprofessional if you cant handle your job then hire somebody who can and fumigate!! calling health department first thing monday!!! best believe something will be done!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know if this place changed ownership in the last two yrs but it sure has changed....for the worst.  I do like the decor and the dress of servers. I like the story of Frieda on the wall. It encourged me to watch a movie about her, which was very good. I found this place about 2 1/2 yrs ago. Way across town from where I live but I went there for the ambiance and food.  It was very good the first second and third time I ate there. Then last spring I went with my daughter. They had done remodeling and removed this cool palapa bar that used to be inside. This time the food was bad. My daughter didn't like her food, I didn't like my enchiladas which I had liked on previous occasions. Today I went in and ordered the special...flautas. He asked me chicken or beef. I asked to have one of each, he seemed confused. Then he asked me flour or corn tortillas. I said I thought Flautas were flour tortillas. He said OK flour. At that moment I knew he only knew enough English to get by. I thought taquitos were corn and flautas were flour? I get the plate of food. The rice andbeans were actually good this time. The flautas were very small. Every other restaurant I have ordered Flautas, they come with sour cream and guacamole. Not these. As plain as could be. I like salsas but theirs was bland and watery. My boyfriend ordered chicken fingers...I know...he wasn't very hungry. They guy tried to tell him that was the children's menu. My boyfriend pointed it out on the menu to the waiter, that it was not on the children's menu. He walked away and came back saying it was OK, he could have the chicken fingers. They were just like a cheap box brand of frozen chicken nuggets. He said they were horrible and refused to eat them. They did take the 8.99 off the bill. Another thing that has changed is the entire menu and the prices for lunch and dinner are the same. They used to have mon-fri lunch menu. Not anymore. The prices are ridiculous. $13-$26 with the average price around $20. Used to be able to get a nice combination lunch for $8.99 to $9.99 average. I want to know if they did indeed change ownership. What I do know is I will never go back to eat there."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. A shout-out to our waiter, Ivan... thank you very much for the super fast service and making us feel so welcome."}
{"text":"We. Just eat here for the first time  on the 12th  and  I have to say  it was a big  disappointment  the food was bland and small portions for the price the hosts was very rude and seem to be having a bad day needles to say I will not be returning and I WILL NOT RECOMMEND this restaurant to anyone who wants to enjoy good authentic Mexican food! Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Amazing service!!! When you come here make sure you see Gabby and Kiki they will provide you with the best drinks you've ever had."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food! This is our new spot when we come to Vegas. So happy we found this gem! I had the asada burrito half red and half green. I like the red half the best and the meat was delicious! I also loved the salsa, which is usually gives me a clue about wether or not I'm going to like the food. Also if you're a souvenir junky like me, they will sell you a picture of your group in a cute Vegas frame. If you don't want to purchase it, you still get a cute free version."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Even brought my parents here for dinner when they were visiting from NY. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros with Chorizo and a large mango margarita. Even my mom who maybe has 2-3 drinks a year found herself ordering one they make the margaritas with actual fruits rather than some pre-made sugary mix and the result is AH-MAZ-ING. This was my second time visiting and even though I live like 30 mins away it's been worth the trip each time. Plus they offer a Groupon for lunch or dinner for 2 so anyone hesitant about checking this out buy the Groupon and give this place a go. The servers are friendly and attentive despite the usual crowds present the 2x I've been here and the salsa is hands down the best salsa I've had it has this smoky flavor unlike anything I've had in the past."}
{"text":"We went to Casa Don Juan to celebrate Mothers' Day. They were not taking reservations but we were told to call ahead when we were about 10 to 15 minutes away and they would put our names on the list.  We did so and we were seated immediately.  When we walked in the wait staff greeted my mother and me with an enthusiastic \"Happy Mothers' Day\"as we walked to our table. The atmosphere is charming, very old Mexico in decor. The wait staff was dressed in beautiful and colorful peasant dress. The food was outstanding. There was complementary chips, salsa and refried beans as an appetizer. We all asked for water, which came quickly.  We also ordered Sangria, which was delicious with plenty of apples and other fruits. We ordered the Fajitas, with different meats with grilled vegetables (green peppers, sweet onions and tomatoes). They were delicious and more than we could possible eat. It was served with warm flour tortias, rice, lettuce, refried beans and guacamole. We topped it off with honey on sopaipillas. The waiter and staff were very accommodating to our requests and very kind to the children."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. Charming atmosphere, complete with a Frida Kahlo wall. Delicious complementary bean dip with your chips and salsa. We love the Seafood soup and ceviche tostada.  Great Margaritas!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic mexican food. The carnitas are so flavorful and juicy. Very tender. The salsa is absolutely delicious! Fast place for lunch if yiu are visiting downtown or work there. Definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I had to use my flashlight in order to see the menu!  That should've been my first sign.  I ordered the wet bean burrito with pork green chile.  First of all, the inside of the burrito was filled with sour cream, a few scrap of lettuce and tomatoes.  Beans are a cheap staple and they must've thought I said 'no beans'.  The green chile had no pork.  Honestly, I should've sent my food back!  I had to pour the runny bean dip they serve prior to ordering on top of what ended up being a wet sour cream burrito!  tNext, my husband ordered carne asada taco's.  The corn tortilla's were not grilled.  They were cold - straight out of the package!  My $10 margarita tasted like pre-mix."}
{"text":"This review has been a long time coming. Casa Don Juan has been a must visit for me the past couple trips to Vegas thanks to a recommendation from a local friend. Why you might ask would I visit a Mexican restaurant with all the buffet choices available? Simple, as my Hispanic friends will say \"I'm an undercover Mexican!\" I love Mexican food from birria, menudo, tacos de lengua con todo por favor, bring it on with extra tapatio! Honestly though my real reason for coming here is their camarones a la diabla! I've had my share of camarones a la diabla and I have to say they are one of the best. The spices and seasoning is perfect if you like food extra spicy the way I do. Plus you won't find any packaged mission tortillas here. They are freshly hand made and their guacamole is amazing! As another yelper stated they do take a souvenir photo while you're there which might seem tourisy but my friends and I did not mind. The waiters were friendly and attentive each time I was there so no complaints from me for customer service. In fact they brought me a cup of water even when I didn't ask for it and kept coming by to see if I needed more water thinking the camarones would be too spicy for me. Tsk, Tsk, little do they know this Asian chica loves the heat! My only gripe would probably be the fact that they do not serve jaimaca. I ask for it each time I'm there in hopes that they will finally say yes but not yet. For now their horchata and jugo de pina will do. In any event, if you're looking for a great Mexican food joint slightly off the hustle and bustle of the strip, give Casa Don Juan a try."}
{"text":"Good service. Food is \"ok\" BUT what really surprised us is that they charge for the salsa if you ask for ir. No advise at all.

Close to 2.00 per the \"salsa roja\" and almost 3.00 for the habanero. How this can happen on a Mexican Food Restaurant?"}
{"text":"This was our first stop after leaving the airport. We were a little tired and very hungry. We were craving Margaritas, so we stopped in here. We were not disappointed! The food was prepared and served as if you were at your grandmother's house! The portions were large, the ingredients tasted fresh, and the plates were served hot. Everything tasted home made and full of flavor! Our servers were very pleasant and the restaurant was clean. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were great. The chips come with a cup of salsa and a cup of bean dip. Staff was friendly and quick. It was unbelievably warm inside though, which made everything really uncomfortable. Food was served fast and was ok. Be careful though, everything is an extra charge. Sour cream is a dollar and a side of guacamole is $4. Sodas were $2.50. Parking is always a bit of a headache but there is an alley to the rear that has more parking available."}
{"text":"Good service, fast food time, delicious entrees and margarita was made with fresh lime juice and agave nectar! Funky paintings and a dessert display complete the setting for a great Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"On a 4-day trip to Vegas we ate here twice. 

Yeah. It's pretty good. 

The standard chips and salsa with each order also come with a bean dip that's pretty good. And actually by the time my food came I was already pretty full from it! On the second visit we ordered the chorizo and cheese appetizer. I was expecting a queso fundifo-type deal, but it was literally partially-melted cheese with some crumbled chorizo and sliced (stewed) jalapenos on top. Quite disappointing, really. Their margaritas are good, and not too sweet.

I got the two cheese enchiladas with rice and beans the first time we went. Their tortillas, both corn and flour, are handmade.

Let me repeat that. Their tortillas are handmade. If that's not reason enough to eat there, then I don't know what is."}
{"text":"We really liked this place, the hand made corn tortillas made the meal, I didn't like the salsa they brought with the chips but when I asked for something hotter they gave us the good stuff. The second time we went they didn't have the fresh tortillas because they only make them at certain times of day. Next time I will keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon to this place. I ordered the Diablo shrimp and had the house margarita. The shrimp was pitiful. It was the cheapest,littlest shrimp you can buy. Like the popcorn shrimp at the store (added pic). The margarita was super weak. I question how much (if any) was added to drink. Below average. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Was hoping for more, good reviews on the restaurant posted, but those people must of either had better service and/or different meal quality.  Food B-, Service D, Margaritas F, Atmosphere B+.  Close to our house, so we were excited about finding a great neighborhood Mexican place.  But unfortunately don't see coming back.  As we have shared in other reviews, this is Vegas baby, you may not get two chances to win a new customer- too many choices!  Each time has to count. Disappointed, expensive (especially for what we got), blah.  Roberto's taco beats this place any day (just get it to go and make Margaritas at home...). Forward we go looking for that neighboorhood Mexican restaurant. 

PS tambourines going off every five minutes made me want to kill myself!"}
{"text":"If your looking for an authentic mexican style restaurant, then Casa Don Juan is the spot for you. This is a little treasure and simply the BEST!  Their beans, guacamole & chips are perfect to start with. The menudo is superb. The Chilaquiles with steak simply to die for, ask for half green and half red!!  LOVED THIS PLACE & ask for JOSE the waiter he rocks!"}
{"text":"Best choice of restaurants I made in Vegas. The staff is awesome. They're friendly fun fast and really care about your experience. The food was great. The decor is very cool. Even the customers were friendly. If you're in Vegas do yourself a favor and come to Casa Don Juan's downtown. I wish I could eat here every day. I hope they open up a restaurant on Kauai soon. Aloha"}
{"text":"I've been to a ton of Mexican joints around town. Many times, I've discovered that it's hard to escape the generic expected tastes that they tend to offer. Casa Don Juan seems to escape that trend by incorporating fresh, homemade flavors that I was able to see and taste. 

Almost immediately after sitting, we were greeted with chips and salsa. Salsa was great, same with the bean dip. I ended up ordering a side of guacamole with the chips, because of the rave Yelps about it. And yes, I'll have to stand by those reviews, because I absolutely loved the guac.

Entrees did not absolutely blow my mind, but they were still very good. The chicken entrees seem to be a bit lackluster, but the beef dishes seem to be more memorable:

-Bistec de pollo: a very basic grilled chicken breast dish. I would avoid. Almost seems like something I could make at home
-Carne Asada taco: delicious, juicy and flavorful pieces of meat. The homemade tortilla goes with this very well. I was a little surprised that nothing else came with the taco. It was just a tortilla filled with meat, with a side of lemon. The carne asada didn't joke around. One bite was both juicy and flavorful. My next visit is going to have to focus on this.
-Chicken mole: much better tasting chicken than the bistec de pollo. I'm thinking it's the sauce that saved it.

To end it all, we finished it off with fried ice cream (see picture). Here it's served a little different than I'm used to. Instead of a simple corn flake coating, they add Fruity Pebbles as well. If you're not a fan of the Fruity Pebble taste, maybe you should avoid this. I personally loved it.
----
All in all, the tortillas and guacamole were some of the best that I've had in Vegas. Friendly service and lively atmosphere were also a plus. Chicken entrees come off a little weak, but the carne asada is sure to impress. If you see me back here, my table will be dedicated exclusively to the cow and whatever it has to offer."}
{"text":"The restaurant opened at 7:00 am, we walked in at 7:10 am. Instead of being greeted, the server told us \"the rice is not ready\". We waited 10 minutes and asked for \"chips and salsa\" the waiter told us \"their cold and not ready\" when we asked for hand made tortillas he told us \"they weren't ready\" as the \"lady had just arrived\". I ordered menudo and it was \"luke warm\", did not want to send it back cause...  the server told us if we wanted the food to be ready to come after 8:00. It didn't make sense to us they open at 7:00. Perhaps their staff should start at 6:00 not when they open!!! Very dissatisfied!!!!"}
{"text":"Their beans are amazing! They give you some along with Salsa for the chips. Best Chili Reno I've ever had. I'll definitely be back here. The staff was friendly. Cool Frida Carlo decor."}
{"text":"In the middle of countless furniture stores, bail bonds, and some thrift shops on Main Street sits this restaurant with really good Mexican food. Very pretty inside! I love the atmosphere. The servers are wearing the outfits to match the festive interior. The service is pretty good. There is street parking with meters (quarters) and there is a  parking lot in the back of the restaurant. For First Friday, they set up seating on the sidewalk.

You get chips & salsa (yummy)- guacamole is  extra. I always get the fish tacos here, which are really good, and good sized, too. In fact, I don't think that I've ever veered away from the fish tacos (and I've been coming here for years now). My husband always gets the beef burrito here.  Prices are reasonable. Participates in the Entertainment Book. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My personal favorite Mexican Place in Vegas. I know the menu by heart and the food is consistently good! I love the ambience and I love the booths. 

The staff is friendly and will fix whatever you want. They care about their customers. 

Some of my favs. are the chicken soup, chile relleno, melt in your mouth carnitas, and their guacamole is fresh and delicious. They have a drink made in a real pineapple that is refreshing and beyond delicious on a hot summer day!  Yummmm!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Best Mexican food in town and best menu!! So much food I had to take home a was a great meal again after reheating."}
{"text":"Love this spot! It is so great to go during a lunch break. Fast service. Great good. Friendly staff! Love the decor! ask for Ivan he's a great server! The chicken enchiladas with salsa verde is DELICIOUS! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican places in town by far!!!!! I love this place. Green Sauce is amazing!!!! Just found out the opened a second location on Buffalo!"}
{"text":"Was here today the food the service was great left feeling full and complete a lot of bang for your buck"}
{"text":"This is always a go to restaurant whenever in Las Vegas. Food is quality and reminds me of my abulita's kitchen.  The service is great and so is the teamwork."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a teriffic meal here.  We both had the enchiladas and the salsa Verde was literally the best we have ever had.  We shared a couple of tamales as well and they were amazing.  Service was quick and attentive.   Atmosphere was fun and what you would expect."}
{"text":"My boyfriend works behind this restaurant and we come here often, everything we order has always been good from their breakfast to their lunch and dinner menus."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, however today was the utmost worst customer service I have ever received in any establishment. 

My friends and I went for a breakfast as we have done several times before. We all ordered Michelada's they charged us ala cart for each one. Two of them were $11.50 which used Tecate beer and the other was $9.00 because it was made with bud light. That was the first strike.  We were never told they were ala cart. 

Two of us ordered the Chilaquiles. I asked to have chorizo added and the server said \"no problem\".  The server then asked my friend if he wanted carne asada, he said no and asked for Carnitas. Again, his reply was no problem. 

Food arrived, my eggs were under cooked so I sent them back. No problem. The food was just ok. Nothing like it usually is. 

When the bill arrived we were shocked to see that the Michelada's were charged for each component of the drink. We were also charged an additional $10.99 each for the additional meat added to the Chiliquiles. The price on the menu was $10.99 for them so we questioned why were were charged $20.99 for an $11.00 dish. The response was due to adding meat to the dish. We asked how much is a side of either chorizo and or carnitas and they said $5.00.  So we asked why were charged double. They had no good reason. I asked the server why he never mentioned the ridiculous up charges and he said it wasn't his fault. Oh yes it was. It's his responsibility of a server to mention any up charge. He should have mentioned it when taking the order. Had I known it was so much we wouldn't have ordered it. 

I have no problem paying for additional meat but to double the price of the dish and have no good reason was absurd. We asked for a manager and the hostess quickly replied he wasn't there. I find that hard to believe that you have a functioning restaurant with no manager in the building. 

They made no attempt to clearly explain the double charge instead of the quoted $5.00. They made no attempt to help rectify the bill. We agreed to pay for the meat but not double. They didn't care.  

We will never go there again or recommend this place. 

Utterly ridiculous."}
{"text":"Pretty unimpressive.... I really wanted to like this place, I've been meaning to try it for a while and haven't had a change to until few days ago. All this wait and anticipation for a mediocre experience. 
The food and drinks left me wondering, \"why the 4 stars?\"
I had the chicken and shrimp fajitas and the Mr had shredded chicken tacos. Both of us were left feeling like we should of went elsewhere..
I had a mango margarita as well and I think this was the worst margarita I've ever had. It did not taste like mango, had no sweetness or liquor.
The best part of the meal was the service and the handmade tortillas. LOVED those!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food. A bit pricey but worth it. The owner Raul is a really nice man. Very accommodating and hard working. 

The enchiladas are great. Tamales too! Even the noodle soup is good too.

Can't go wrong here. There is a bar too with full accommodations. 

Best downtown Las Vegas Mexican joint."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!! Muy Bueno! The service is STELLAR! The food is sooooooo good and tastes so authentic!  The decor really makes you feel like your in some part of mexico! If they had some music playing it would have really taken me to Mexico. I HIGHLY recommend stopping by here if in Vegas! Near downtown Vegas."}
{"text":"Located in the Arts District. This place has an extensive menu and everything on it looks very good. It's great to find a Mexican restaurant that isn't a chain. The atmosphere is festive but not crazy and the service is very good. If you are in the Arts District stop in and enjoy yourself. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Margaraitas are weak...it's the yellowish sweet-sour mixer.  Chiles Rellenos looked soggy and tasted as if fried in old oil.  Crispy beef taco shell wasn't fried, it was toasted on the grill.  We've also been disappointed with their dry tamales.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best mexican food I've had in the US to date (and I've been everywhere except New England, Alaska, and Hawaii). The refried beans have pork in them which sucks for me since I'm allergic to pig, but all 5 of us loved the meal. Very pleased and a must-visit for anyone that prefers a less touristy Las Vegas experience."}
{"text":"This place is muy bueno!

So me and the hubby were headed to a different (read: much further away) Yelp-recommended Mexican joint for some authentic south-of-the-border grub while we were in Vegas for the weekend. Then our casino taxi stand man recommended instead to head to Casa Don Juan and that he's sent many people through the years and they were never disappointed.  To continue with my rule of always trust the locals for great food, off we went!

The décor in this place is awesome - I don't know much about Don Juan, but clearly he was in love with Frida, cuz the walls are basically a tribute to her from an obsessed fan.  Super cool, authentic Mexican décor.

Every time we're in the states we try to get some great Mexican food because (Sorry Canada!) at home it's pretty terrible stuff.This place has an extensive menu, tons of variety, and all reasonably priced.  They have tons of combos to choose from, but they are also flexible if you want something different.
But first, one of the best features is the wicked salsa you get with the free chips.  It was so flavorful I couldn't stop eating! It wasn't spicy at all, but to some people that's preferred, and it's super easy to eat.  They also served a side of refried beans for dipping too, which was unique.
I ordered a chile relleno and chicken enchilada combo and it was fab. A bit too much cheese inside the relleno (I know - too much cheese? as if there's such a thing! But there was seriously ALOT), but overall a very enjoyable meal.  My husband had a taco, relleno and tamale combo, and as far as I could tell, the tamale was the star.  The huge chunks of flavorful, tender pork were impressive!

Another star here was my mango daiquiri (I'm too much of wimp for tequila).  I think I can safely say that it's the best one I've ever had.  So fruity, smooth, and didn't tasty boozy (but you knew there was a healthy serving of rum in there!).

The service was also impeccable.  Attentive, polite, accommodating, friendly, and really made you feel taken care of.  

So, overall - fantastic!  If you're staying near Freemont and want Mexican, check it out!"}
{"text":"First of all, as you can tell by my pic, I'm a latina, mexican to be exact, so when it comes to mexican food, no one beats grandma or mom's cooking.  I've yet to find AMAZING mexican food in Las Vegas which is pretty damn disappointing.  Casa Don Juan is near my downtown office so I've been several times.  Here's a little rundown as I've tried several things on the menu-

Chips and Salsa- the colorful dressed waitstaff bring out chips and salsa with black beans which is pretty awesome. Bonus points for the black beans fo sho!   Add a margarita on the rocks (with salt of course, hey, I said I was mexican. lol) and BAM!  You have one of my favorite snacks/appetizers.

Guacamole- I'm suuuper picky with my guacamole and pride myself on making the best.  Meh.  Enough said.

Caldo- for you gringos, that means soup.  Probably my favorite thing at Casa.  Served with homemade tortillas. Its pretty amazeballs!!!  Damn I wish I had some for breakfast right now. Big bowl with veggies, beef, and spice filled broth that is out of this world!  Most people sprinkle the top with fresh onions, cilantro, and lime. I hold the onions, but wow, definitely a tasty filling meal!

Tacos- unlike that disgusting place down the road Macayos, Casa's taco shells are homemade.  Filled with shredded chicken (or beef), lettuce and tomato...BOMB.

Enchiladas- pretty gross.  the sauce is runny and just doesn't have a good taste.  Actually their enchiladas get a big fat \"D-.\"  The only thing worse than Casa's enchiladas are when people make enchiladas with FLOUR tortillas instead of corn.  WHAAAAT??  Fail.

Chile Relleno- ugh, I hate when a place messes up a chile relleno. Its pretty filling, cheese is just right, but the awful sauce they suffocate that poor chile with is pure caca. See my above review on enchiladas.

Rice and beans- pretty impressive!  I'm probably the most picky when it comes to these two sides and I have to say, they're almost perfect.

Margaritas- awesome!  They get an extra star for their tasty drinks.  The only time I crave a margarita is with my chips and salsa, but these are done RIGHT. I also request a better tequila because tequila makes me SUPER feisty! I Know my limits. lol.

Service- always very fast and not to toot my own horn but the owner likes a pretty lady so yeah, I always get seated very fast.  Just saying because its so obvious! lol.  

Prices- they've upped their prices over the last few years, so their specials are the way to go if you're trying to keep the cost down.  For good mexican I'll pay more, just not sure if this place is completely worth it.  

Overall Casa Don Juan is decent.  I'm always up for suggestions on great mexican food.  I want AUTHENTIC.  No more messing around for this little mexi."}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended and did not disappoint!! The staff was friendly. Our server, Ivan, was adorable and very knowledgeable about the menu and recommendations. I had a coconut margarita and the carne asada. Both absolutely delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly and the corn tortillas are homemade."}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better then this! The food the people everything over the top great"}
{"text":"This is our tradition when we come to Las Vegas for the NASCAR RACES in March. Excellent food and drinks. I had the Chimichonga, made to order.   Dan and Gina said the Fajitas were very good. I had a Peach Margarita, so delicious.   Very clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing. They treat you like family and the food! To die for!! I will definitely be back. Ask them to try their SALT tequila! Chocolate is my favorite! Make sure to try their Parrillada, so delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Went here last Friday for lunch. The place was packed at 11:30.  Didn't have any problems with parking. Super friendly manager, we were seated quickly.  

Right when we got to the table we got chips, beans, guacamole and salsa. 

My advise is get al carte, that way you can try a few things.  I got a tamale and it was amazing! So if you try anything then get the tamale, they make them onsite. I also got a fish taco and it was good. Awesome and strong margartias! 

They do have outsite seating but who in their right mind would want to sit in the dead heat when they can sit inside.  I will definately come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We flew to Vegas for a 2 day trip last month and managed to eat here twice. The food was delicious and the staff was very welcoming. The prices weren't bad at all and the customer service was on point. I would recommend this place for sure. I plan on going again when we head back to Vegas in December"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. They are very nice and attentive. I love the atmosphere! It did not take long at all to receive our food. I will be honest, I have had better mexican food in my days, but no real complaints. I would go back for a casual lunch or fun dinner date."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. The food is just like any other Mexican restaurant. Your main dish with a side of beans and rice. My boyfriend and I got Micheladas and a Pina Colada, nothing to go crazy about. I felt the Pina barely had any Rum in it and I have had cheaper and better Micheladas at Restaurant El Rey for A LOT cheaper. I had a tamale de jalapeños and queso which very good and so where's their cheesecake. My boyfriend had carne asada and he enjoyed it very much. Our second server was really amazing though and for him alone I would return."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food, just what I was looking for. The area is under construction so parking was a disaster. Nothing special about the food but it was fine. Waiters are dressed in all-out mariachi style attire."}
{"text":"The food is expensive and not that flavorful. Plus they do mandatory 18% tip if there's 8 people. They can't get an order right or split a check right and all the waiters and workers smile to your face. Bland food with rude workers. Pass on this place."}
{"text":"Great food and great service,  thank you Jose E we enjoyed our breakfast, we will be back soon."}
{"text":"The staff and service are grey, no complaints there.  However, this is my third visit to this restaurant and I feel like the food quality has declined.  The michelada was watered down - not a great tomato mix at all which is the base for a great drink since the only mixer is beer from a bottle.  The guacamole was awful.  We ordered it and it came out in less than a minute so you know it was pre-batched (which is fine, it didn't specify table side or fresh) but it was so bland.  It appeared to be just smashed up avocado.  No other spices or ingredients at all.  

When the chips are the most flavorful item among a michelada and guacamole, there's a problem.

We didn't even order a main dish we were so disappointed with our initial course."}
{"text":"I really loved the food the reason I'm giving it a 3 they charged all of us more. And they also charged us the table because we were a large group calm on that is ridiculous.We did love the food and if i come back with a large group get separated tables if  not they will charge a lot and also if your not paying all together make sure that you tell them before you pay and they charge what they didn't bring to  you."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place! I am crazy for Mexican food and this place was a paradise for me! My husband took me here for my birthday. I loved the Mexican art on walls and our server Ivan was great!

My food was so good I Forgot to take a picture, so I have nothing to show you except me with a big sombrero after the staff dang Happy birthday to me. 

Promise: I will visit this place every time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm Mexican. Grandparents are gone. Mother is gone. This tasted just like grandma/moms kitchen!  I was walking down the street shopping and stopped a local for a restaurant recommendation (I'm from San Francisco -visiting). She said only one place to eat is Casa Don Juan. Tamales are out of this world. Service is great!  We ordered. I had 6 chips and salsa. I was opening my straw and the food arrived -nice and hot. Literally, 4 minutes passed! Couldn't believe it!  This is a must in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Casa don Juan and I have had an up and down relationship in the past. The first time I came here I loved it, second time I was disappointed. It's been about two years (honest to goodness, really TWO YEARS?! time flies.) that I've been back.

After checking out the new bar down the street (which I will review later) my friend and I were having drunk hunger pains. I was in the mood for Mexican and was contemplating El Gordo, but since Casa don Juan was in perfect walking distance we decided to dine-in here once again.

Let's begin with pricing - I think theirs stinks big time. Look, most Mexican places in Vegas are traditionally not hard on your wallet. You can usually get a combo plate in the 10 buck range (including taxes) as long as you aren't ordering carne asada or shrimp. But not at CJ's. Dinner menu boasts prices of $11.99+ and even appetizers prices are flagrantly high, especially considering the location of this place. Look, I'm not a cheapskate, nor do I think businesses should not make money, but the bottom line is I can go to numerous other Mexican restaurants and have just as good food for about 5 dollars less.

Food - Chips were brought out cold. Bean dip was decent and warm. Salsa at least has a spice-kick to it, so it's not totally bland.

Ordered - The \"Casa don Juan\" style wet burrito with chicken. The burrito is a decent size, comes with guac on top and the \"wet\" sauce. As for inside, you get beans, lettuce, meat, pico de gallo, rice, and lettuce. To me, the lettuce was gross, wet and mushy. The beans were eh same goes for the rice. The chicken was not seasoned very well - just plain 'ol shredded chicken. Overall the burrito was filling for my drunk tummy and that's all she wrote.

So. The deal is I would really love to at least LIKE Casa don Juan, but they just ain't cutting it. They need to make the food better and keep the prices, or they need to lower their menu prices and keep the same mediocre food. As with many places downtown I think Casa don Juan is going through growing pains and adapting to the new popularity that a decent downtown experience has to offer. I hope they find a happy medium, and I may try them again in the future. We shall see."}
{"text":"So delicious! We had a Mexican salad, chicken fajitas, chimichangas to die for! Everything was delicious and considering it was Cinco de mayo they were very fast! Fun atmosphere too! For four of us our bill was only $110. Great place to celebrate! 

The atmosphere is delightful with Frida Kahlo pictures and fun salsa music"}
{"text":"Casa Don Juans is the best Mexican food in town and its downtown location makes for a great night out. Do yourself a favor and try it."}
{"text":"We enjoy Casa Don Juan, the food is delicious my favorite items are the tamales and wet burritos and of course the chips and salsa, the service is usually pretty good, my favorite waiter is Jorge L he's fun and attentive. We love the the main location. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I went there based on the reviews of fellow Yelpers and was not disappointed.  We shared the Carnitas and enjoyed the homemade corn tortillas.  I'm going back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and the service is consistently excellent.  The food is great... just not quite there to put it over the top at five stars.  VERY close though.  It's a lovely place to spend time watching people walking around the antique shops."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp would strike the \"A\" from \"A-OK.\"  Casa Don Juan is fair, but doesn't rate an A in my book. That Scarlet letter is making me give this two stars.

I've been to the one on Buffalo and really liked the atmosphere, food, and service.  Here, not so much.  But we were downtown, which doesn't happen often, with a Groupon that had expired, but still worth something, so we went.  And even though it was a Saturday night, the place was nearly empty, so there was plenty of space in the parking lot.

The restaurant was freezing, so much so that my husband was visibly shaking from the cold.  No matter which table we tried, it was the same.  And active ceiling fans only made it worse.  Luckily, I had a sweatshirt in the car, but he was SOL. Even though the manager grudgingly turned down the thermostat, it didn't help much.  It's hard to enjoy the best meal when you're colder than a cadaver with rigor mortis.

But this wasn't the best meal.  Herb had Chicken in Mole, which was a pretty small portion, and I ordered Chilaquiles.  I don't think any two restaurants, or even two Mexican madres, make it the same way, but this was simply ordinary.  I ordered the green sauce, because the waiter said it was spicier than the red, but it turned out to be 2 or 3 out of 10, and I don't like overly spicy food.  Also, it was just about the most expensive item on the menu, and I can't figure out why.  A little chicken, a lot of fried tortilla chips, some sauce, no leftovers.  And I'm not a big eater.

There was nothing welcoming about the service, either from the front or from our waiter, who wasn't terribly friendly and seemed to be perpetually annoyed, even though we demanded nothing.  

I read that they're going to be doubling the size.  I wish them well.  They won't be doing it for us. There are too many other Mexican joints in town that are much, much better."}
{"text":"We came here during a \"First Friday\" trying to get away from the crowds but this place was also very crowded! We were seated in 5 minutes so it wasn't an issue. It's very festive in decor with Frida Kahlo pictures adorning the walls.

I started off by ordering a lemonade.  I thought it was going to be lemonade from a fountain dispenser but it was freshly squeezed! It was a foamy lemon/lime concoction. It was delicious but no free refills so I settled on one. I also saw people drinking out of a pineapple. It looked refreshing but I didn't know what it was. 

I had the beef flautas which to me is like a rolled taco. It came with rice and beans. I forgot to tell them to hold the beans. It was good but my brother ordered the carne asada torta which tasted better. I told him he can have some of my flautas if he gave me some of his torta. The bread looked home made because the top looked bubbly. It isn't flat like the ones you would get at Robertos. My husband must have loved the Carne asada burrito because he was finished so fast!

It is a busy place so don't expect your food to come out right away. It was also noisy because there were lots of groups just having a fun time! It's a nice place to gather with friends and family."}
{"text":"could never get a chance to get to this this place til this Sunday  with my family.And this place is a tourist trap ...FLAVORLESS.
Some one has gotta be tipping off people to post awesome things about this place because There is no way this place is what they say HUGE disappointment.My family and I try many different places and there are a ton of better flavored places .the asada had no spice at all and for 15.99 you would think it would do a hat dance .the enchiladas were border line the flavor of something out of box.and who ever posted the tamales were awesome???you better get your taste buds checked.3.75 for a giant tub of masa and a sliver of tasteless meat.You can look at the pics and see the serving look like there lame enough to be served on a paper plate.after we ate we couldn't believe a dinner for 3 with one drink each was 85.00 .those if you who really think this place is off the hook need to get out more often.this is vegaaaaaasss.i think this place may have been a good local spot at one time with all I hear about it ,but like some places like that they start skimping on quality .ill eat from a taco truck before I go back there again."}
{"text":"We went with friends during first friday and despite the fact they were extremely busy, we were seated within a couple of minutes.
The wait staff is very attentive and quick.
The margaritas are okay... very large in size, but nothing spectacular in taste.
This same theme repeated itself with our meal..... very large portions, but nothing spectacular in taste.
The chips, salsa, and beans were pretty good but chips aren't warm or exceptionally fresh. The salsa was fresh but had no spice to it at all.
I had a chicken enchilada and a cheese enchilada with rice and beans.... it was okay... not bad.... not really anything to get excited about.
My husband had the whole fried fish (tilapia). He said it was good.
Our friends ordered the chicken fajitas and the steak fajitas. The portions are very large, but again flavors are bland, nothing seemed very fresh. It was just very ordinary and quite flavorless.
There are so many great Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas that I just can't see myself coming back to Casa Don Juan again."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! I come here often, but I forget to check in! 
All I can think about is eating the food and drinking the Mojitos! The margaritas are good too, but I am the Mojito Momma!
Easy in and out downtown location! Great for lunch or dinner! Meet friends, have a couple of drinks! CHips and salsa are fantastic, but ne sure to try the cheese dip! THAT IS THE BEST!

Everything there is amazing and I am TICKLED that a new location is opening out Northwest closer to me! 

The most amazing thing I have noticed at Casa is that no matter what you order or when, they bring fresh, HOT food to the table QUICKLY! Must be some magic going on back in that kitchen!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good , I always order the guacamole as an appetizer ( really good) and as my entree i always get shrimp diablo which is spicy shrimp in a red sauce it comes with rice and beans.  The waiters are nice and the service is really fast.  They have great sangria and their prices are good."}
{"text":"Food was really good. But Jorge M was the most sweetest person in the world, will go back just for him."}
{"text":"Ok....this is officially my favorite Mexican restaurant so far.  
The location is great for me, so we thought we would stop on the way to Fremont to check it out. Glad we did.  Although the lady at the front was kinda rude, she was the only one the rest of the night that was.  Everyone from the hostess, to the many waiters checking on us, were all super friendly and accommodating. 
I ordered the jumbo Cadillac margarita, and my friend got a frozen mixed mango and strawberry margarita. Check out the picture. It was so pretty!  
We got chips, salsa, and beans when we first sat down. The salsa was not the best I ever had, but it was good and I loved that it was actually spicy. Then we ordered cheese dip and guacamole to go with it. The cheese was good, and the guacamole was delicious. However, this was a mistake, because when we were into our second basket of chips, we realized we were too full for our meal. 
We had ordered the mixed appetizer for two, which was $20. Surprisingly everything on the plate was good. It had chicken chimichangas, beef flautas, carne asada nachos and quesadillas. It was way too much food, but we had to at least try everything....it was all good, so needless to say, we were stuffed. 
After we finished our drinks, the waiters rolled us out to the curb for a cab pick up. 
I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place and have loved it since I went to their grand opening party for family and friends in I wanna say 2004!

I loooove their taco combo and hubby gets their mixed cocktail. This last time we went with some friends and we got their mixed beef and seafood platter for 4 and it was the bomb lol!!  It had shrimp wrapped in bacon, two whole fried fish, fried shrimp, grilled steak, fish filets, shrimp and octopus ala diablo, rice beans guacamole , and tortillas! Im probably even missing stuff....We were all suuuuper full and it makes me wanna go right now just thinkin about it!! The service is always quick they have tasty margaritas, a full bar, and a bunch of different beers. Only real con is the parking!! It's kinda horrible but I always seem to have luck so I won't even deduct a star for it."}
{"text":"Lunch gets pretty packed with the downtown government employee crowd, but there are generally tons of staff to help you get in, fed, and out.  I've went a couple times around 2pm and loved it.  If you're looking for mariachis, then bring an iPod.  If you want Roberto's style quick food, then go to Robertos.  This place has decently priced beers and food.  I'm a fan of kicking back a couple Modelo's with some chips, salsa, and cocktail de camarones.  But then again, if you're in a lunch rush, I don't think two or three beers is what you should be after.

Overall, good place to grab a bite/brew with some friends, although for a date, the Bar + Arts Bistro is probably better to head to."}
{"text":"I went here as part of a company dinner while we were in Vegas on business. The guys swore by it, saying they had been there each year during this particular trade show and it was terrific.

Everything about the restaurant was pretty unappetizing... The condiments on the table consisted of chips, a watery substance that I think was supposed to be salsa, and a grey paste that I think was supposed to be bean dip. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, thinking that would be safe enough, however it tasted pretty bad and I only ate about 4 bites of it.

However, 4 bites turned out to be enough to cause the worst food poisoning I've ever had, which kicked up around midnight that night and lasted until noon the next day.  I spoke to the other person in our party who had ordered the same thing as me, and sure enough, she had gotten sick too.

Needless to say, I will not be going to this restaurant ever again. Ever."}
{"text":"Nice, very busy restaurant. Food was typical Mexican food. My boyfriend had the seven seas cocktail and he loved it. I had a 3 item combo of chile releno , beef taco, beef enchilada . Everything tasted good. Also ordered a piña colada which tasted amazing. Only complaint is it was a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Just came in and the food was average . Not a very busy rush we waited a long time to order but our server did not check on us once even after our food was served to ask if everything was ok . We had to call someone to get us a refill and the lady sitting one table behind us was looking for the server too so she can put her order in . Luego  que andaba peliando los meceros contra  cocineros que le pida bien el pendo o mandalo ala verga esas fueron sus palabras. Ta bien si dejo propinas."}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG. I love this place. We come here every year after our Bike event with a staff of 20-25 and they are always very accommodating. The cheese dip with jalapenos is to die for and the tortilla chips are crispy and warm. 

I love that they have so many options for combinations, salads, soups, ceviche, etc. Everything I've eaten here is simple and delicious. The skinny margarita is also delicious."}
{"text":"This place is not at all what it use to be. I came here for lunch on different occasions and have tried different meals. I felt the quality of food was not to par and was not worth returning to. The cheese enchiladas had a sauce I felt was recycled from the day before. The sauce was very dark and thick. The rice was stale and not tasty either. So sad because it's so close to work."}
{"text":"we went there on a sunday night . wow shrimp way over priced!!! who ever heard of butterfly shrimp wrapped in bacon!!!  oh my god!!! should have said it on the menu!!!glad we had a groupon !!!save your money and try somewhere  other than this dive!!!"}
{"text":"Back from lunch. And was it top notch. Shrimp enchiladas and chicken fajitas the best of the best. Cadillac margarita to die for! A must try place to go to."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. My Latina wife and I stumbled upon it, and have since been back twice with family.  We recently had a wedding and took both of our families out to it twice because everyone liked it so much, and the menu was extensive.  You get a good sized meal, and maybe some take home for around $15.  We live in Arizona and New Mexico and check out some of the best Mexican fare restaurants, and not only is this authentic it is also very good.  
Great place for lunch, dinner, and fun for families.  Fun & festive too."}
{"text":"If I could give my experience 0 stars I would. 

The service was just awful! 

It started with 20 minutes for a drink order. Our server brought the wrong margarita. We ordered mango and they brought strawberry. The owner came over and told us off saying we ordered the wrong margarita and it was our error. She stood there scolding us saying we ordered strawberry when clearly we did not. They re-make the margarita and bring it and it's still the wrong one - a regular instead of mango (but at that point who cared). Our server forgot to order someones food and when we asked he said we never ordered it (even though we did and he repeated it back to us). The server then brought the wrong food for another person. 

When we spoke to the owner afterwards (again), she was just as rude (if not worse) and then said FINE I'll give you a 10% off coupon. We told her, we don't want a coupon we're just giving you feedback. We're not complaining for a coupon or discount. She raised her voice, started walking away, rolling her eyes and said it was all our fault. Granted, we're not a group of rocket scientists but being college educated adults I think we know how to order a meal. She was a real witch.

Never ever again. Great food or not, the worst service ever."}
{"text":"As always the food was great. However today I want I want to rave about the service. Our waiter was Jesus who did a great job, but the bus person Benjamin was amazing. He was on top of our drinks and any other needs instantly. He was helpful with any questions we had and Benjamin made our visit more enjoyable then usual. We come here often but this was the first time I remembered to write a review. Awesome job  Benjamin !"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the pretty decorations and decent service: food is terrible. Ordered an horchata but got watered down skim milk; ordered shrimp burrito which was too bland. Not coming here again"}
{"text":"I am usually a huge fan of Casa Don Juan.  My husband and I go there often for dinner and have always enjoyed it. It is close to my work and co-workers and I go there regularly, but yesterday my experience was disappointing.  I had a Groupon and went there with a couple co-workers. I ordered a Vegetarian Burrito.  I have ordered this burrito many times and have always enjoyed it.  To make it a little more substantial, I asked if I could add chicken to the burrito. The server said that it would be an extra charge, which I completely understood.  The burrito already has rice, beans, cheese, lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, and pico, so of course charging for chicken is understandable. When we received the bill, they had charged $7.99 for chicken! That is more than the burrito itself (Vegetarian Burrito is $5.99)!  Another co-worker of mine ordered a chicken burrito wet, and it was $7.99.  She wanted sour cream so they charged extra for it.  That is understandable, but charging $5.99 for the vegetarian burrito and then $7.99 for chicken to be added is ridiculous!  I asked the server what the $7.99 was for and she told me it was for the chicken, and \"I told you that would be an extra charge.\"  I told her I understand that, but $7.99 on top of the $5.99 for the burrito was not reasonable. I then asked to speak to a manager.  The manager came over and I explained the situation to him.  He responded, \"She told you there would be an extra charge for the chicken.\" I told him I understood that, but $7.99 seems a little unreasonable and if you are going to charge that much you should tell your customers because I am sure no one would pay that.  You could order a whole other burrito for that price! He said that it was rude to tell people the price because it appears that you are implying that they can't afford the $7.99. I told him it was rude and dishonest to NOT tell your customers you were charging them $7.99 for a piece of chicken. He finally stated that he couldn't do anything, that they charged what the owner makes them charge, and \"it is what it is.\"  I was so appalled by their attitudes and lack of customer service. They didn't even try to fix the situation.  Like I said, I do not work far from there, and many of my co-workers go there because we enjoy the food and usually good customer service, but this was unacceptable.  I have told other co-workers and friends about our experience yesterday and they couldn't believe it.  They all thought it was unreasonable and dishonest and were very disappointed. I don't want to say that we will never go back, but it definitely left a bad taste in our mouths and we won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My first and last experience at Casa Don Juan had to have been one of the absolute worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. 

The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is unaccommodating and unwelcoming, and the staff treats you like trash if you ask for the simplest things. On top of their already overpriced dishes, charging $1.50 for a small spoonful of sour cream and accusing their customers of LYING when they receive the wrong order leads me to believe that the restaurant honestly doesn't care about their customers, and they are only out to leech money from them. 

It would be much more worth your time and experience going to another fine Mexican restaurant in town like Bonito Michoacan on Decatur than to be harassed and provided with the lousy service at Casa Con Juan. It's a shame, really."}
{"text":"The plates are extremely over priced. The food is just okay. And the service was meh. We had a large party and were rushed out , plates were taken away even though food wasn't finished , it was just a mess. The servers were attentive . It suck because I used to be a huge fan of this place . I brought my In-laws here and I was embarrassed that I recommended this place."}
{"text":"I love this place. I come to visit Las Vegas maybe once or twice a year, but I ALWAYS make sure I visit Casa Don Juan. The food is fantastic and the guacamole is amazing. The staff is friendly, albeit slow (hence the four stars), but the old man that always plays us guitar is adorable and they always treat us well. Some of the best Mexican food I've had!"}
{"text":"Groupon deal with margaritas! That's what brought me in the door. What will keep me coming back? It's certainly not the blandness of all the foods I tasted here. I think they forgot to order salt for the kitchen. The service was exceptional though.

Bland food aside, the atmosphere here was quite festive.The colorful and eccentric chandeliers in the bar were my favorite.  I love that they do karaoke every night of the week, but I didn't stay long enough to wait for it to begin.The service was attentive and thoughtful. I ordered the shrimp burrito (of course it wasn't on the menu, but whenever I'm at a Mexican restaurant I always order a burrito with seafood), and my sweetie ordered the 3 chicken enchiladas combo plate. 

The food is served just as you would expect at a Mexican restaurant: with a heaping helping of rice and beans on the side, and the sauces would have been fantastic if they had just added SALT to the dishes. 

The jumbo  Cadillac margaritas were included in the deal, and boy were they delicious! 

With the Groupon deal this place was a great bargain. I'll be back again for the karaoke,  and hopefully they'll supply the chef with some salt for the food next time."}
{"text":"Came here just two days ago, service was really good and very nice. Food was tasty also. This is my best friends favorite restaurant in Downtown Vegas so I'm sure we will be returning sometime soon!"}
{"text":"We always find our way to Casa Don Juan when visiting my Father in Las Vegas. Never disappoints,  food is always delicious.  But today 04/29/16 I want to focus on Customer service. They really shine in this area.  I was particularly impressed by the waiters who helped each other out by tending to all customers regardless if that was there table or not.  The service extended to the customers was awesome and needs to be applauded.#el servicio al cliente tiene que ser aplaudida#"}
{"text":"Service, food, and Micheladas are really good.  I had the Lengua en Chile Verde. .. totally recommended."}
{"text":"This is hands-down my favorite Mexican restaurant. I've visited many times over the years and the service has always been excellent. Their lunch service is especially fast but their servers actually seem to want to be there. The food is so good and the place is always full."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Mexican food with a great atmosphere, this is the place. We are locals and are always looking for great Mexican restaurants and Casa Don Juan does not disappoint! Some friends told us about the great Cadillac margaritas and terrific food and they weren't kidding. I think these may have been some of the best carnitas I've ever tasted, and I just got back from Old Town in San Diego. These were way better! Great staff - Cruz was our waiter and did an awesome job. The whole staff is on it, making sure you are having a great time. When we were there, at my request, a great young mariachi band with a terrific female lead sang 'Bessa Memucho,'  to us. What could be better?! Enjoy the experience!"}
{"text":"Definitely would come back here next time we come to Vegas.

My boyfriend and I came here first time . We were recommend by our cab driver that this place was awesome. & he did not let us down 

Service is great, seating was fast and food was served really quick. 

The plates are huge and the food is delicious  people are really friendly and check up on you to make sure everything is going really good. Good experience make sure to try the shrimp ceviche and wet burritos ..."}
{"text":"The best restaurant I have been in Vegas  the food is so good and the customer is so good and also is so cheap"}
{"text":"Nice little gem kinda hidden from the tourist trap zone. We found this deal on Groupon and decided to give it a try. Short drive from the strip, adequate parking, no waiting, friendly and courteous staff. Ambience, food, and prices were all good. Notable for my wife and I, was the guacamole, and the tamales."}
{"text":"Great authentic place for Mexican cuisine. The second you walk in it just gives off a good vibe. Food was really good too, I ordered the fajitas and everything came out fresh and hot. Only thing I wasn't too fond of was the guacamole. It was too plain. Just avocados and cilantro. It needed more salt line juice onions peppers etc."}
{"text":"Great service, everyone is so friendly n nice. I went in for lunch I love how they make hand made tortillas real Mexican food so tasty and fresh and they have chips salsa & bean dip FOR FREE.. Great place for birthday dinners or any occasion!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. Soups, margaritas and dinner! Simply fresh and best Mexican food ever!"}
{"text":"Since I moved to Las Vegas a few years ago Yelp has rarely been wrong when it comes to restaurants. But in the case of Casa Don Juan the 3 1/2 stars they have at the time this review is being written is 2 1/2 stars too much. 

I ended up giving Casa Don Juan a try for lunch. And to be honest while it's been less than 2 weeks since I was there I remember these things..which are not good. 

Flat iced tea. Very slow service. A very long wait for my check and my debit card to be returned. I do remember trying to enjoy a beef taco but it was too greasy to finish. I remember flavorless chips and...well they call it salsa but I thought perhaps someone confused the salsa bucket in the back with a water jug and they decided to fill it with tap water before realizing their mistake. It was red...it had cilantro and other stuff in it, but it was not anything I'd want to eat again. 

I'm really struggling to find something positive to say about this place...and I just can't. I wave my white flag of surrender...I ended up not eating the cheese enchilada! I've never left a cheese enchilada on my plate before. How in the heck can someone mess up a cheese enchilada and leave it flavorless is beyond me but they found a way to do it. To call this stuff authentic...please, stop drinking the tequila because it's not all that. 

1 Star - And that's only because I'm forced to give at least one to post."}
{"text":"We had breakfast at this long established, downtown Mexican eatery on our first morning in town.  The restaurant is decked out in a festive motif.  We were served industrial tortilla chips, a watery salsa and a lightweight bean dip.  We each chose huevos rancheros that were accompanied by watery refried beans and the usual tasteless Spanish rice.  Nothing was bad, nor was anything particularly good.  Our bill came up short of our gift certificate's face value so we ordered 2 slices of (mediocre) flan to go."}
{"text":"My favorite! Food never disappoints, Margaritas are huge! And service is amazing. Friendly and fast :)"}
{"text":"I've brought many of my friends to this location. I go here very often, it never disappoints. The food is always delicious. I try to get different things off of the menu when I come. Definitely buy there Groupon when you go if it's available."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican restaurant I've been to.  And I'm from San Diego so I've been to a lot.  Wish we had a Casa Don Juan down there!  The beans they serve with chips and salsa are a culinary work of art as well as the salsa.  I've eaten there several times and it's always been great.  Pork and chicken tamales were awesome as well as the enchiladas.  LOVE this place and always make it a must stop at whenever I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"We went to have lunch, pretty busy to be Monday at 11:30am. So that's a good sign. My husband ordered a wet burrito and I ordered the two green enchiladas combo and coffe. Let me tell you this. The whole meal was absolutely delicious. Our server was nice but the busser made sure we had everything we need and was really nice and professional. We always had our drinks full, So thank you so much Rafael your service is top notch.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came to this spot for a birthday dinner. The service was amazing and the food was great. Gabby the bartender was more than exceptional! This service was like family treatment, you cannot find this anywhere else! Come here enjoy and go to the bar and ask for gabby!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! We had an energetic waiter. Food was tasty. Only downfall some of
 the mint leaves in the mojitos were very dark brown so it made the drink appear like you were drinking leaves with dirt. We didn't send them back - they provided great table conversation for all of us."}
{"text":"One of the best pork and beef tacos around! The food is delicious and authentic. 2nd time here and nothing bad to say. Nothing but a positive experience. Also, I normally don't like horchata, but the best ones I've had so far was this place, the Bacchanal Buffet and at my work. I like when the Horchata isn't strong in spices, but more creamy and smooth. Also, the chips, bean dip, salsa and guacamole are to die for. I can't stop eating it because it's so good. They need a location in California, OC and LA. :D"}
{"text":"Casa Don Juan has a habanero salsa that is not on the menu so you have to request it. (there is an additional charge)

It's so tasty that I actually order a larger side \"to go\" & I take it home for snacks and marinades.

Prepare yourself, this salsa is ADDICTING! 

you're welcome :)"}
{"text":"I visited CDJ for the first time last night because I don't live in the neighborhood and was meeting a friend.

The service was fast and friendly, in fact, our beers and food came out so quickly I was a little shocked. My friend informed me that the food is alway fast. But I know why: the same rice and beans adorn every plate. In fact, the only difference from our two plates was my eggs were probably fried in a pan and his chimichanga was probably fried in a deep fryer.

I thought our service was great from the time we walked in to the time we left. Everyone was happy, friendly, and helpful. This goes a long way for me even if the food isn't that great. I would even go as far to say that the service is what kept this place from getting a two-star rating from me. 

Unfortunately, the food wasn't good enough in my book to make a return visit. The food was generally underseasoned and un-inspiring. This is very standard Mexican fare and nothing outside the box. Maybe it is what it is, but this place is a cliche of a place with excellent service.."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience here at Don Juan. The staff was dressed in cultural attire, the place was immaculate and so welcoming. IVAN, provided exceptional service. Come on down!"}

{"text":"02/14/11 LUNCH. New to the LV region. Had Mexican food in the Los Angeles area for 41 years, so I'm spoiled. Been to a few other mexican places before coming here, this is one of the first reviews I'll write about them. OK, today. Ordered cadillac margarita, which was OK but expensive. Chile relleno was OK. (Chapala's has better ones, IMO.) Good green chili chicken tamale, but not enough of the sauce. Overall, nothing special, and EXPENSIVE for the experience, especially for a lunch. PS I should mention, the wait staff, albeit a little overwhelmed by the crowd for Valentine's Day lunch, were VERY COURTEOUS and WONDERFUL to me. ALL very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We went there on a Groupon  deal. 

The place was so busy! 

The hostess was very pleasant.

The server was very nice. He must have thought I could speak Spanish because he only spoke Spanish to us. I did spoke my best Spanglish, I guess it worked. lol

The food is really great. 

The nachos they bring out were addicting. The salsa was so fresh and delicious. 

I had the Carnitas. Friggin amazing. The guacamole was so fresh too. 
GF had the fish tacos, she was pleased with them too. 

We had a great experience."}
{"text":"I love this place because it has a great vibe and excellent food. They are always clean and I have never been given a sticky menu (I hate places that hand me a nasty sticky menu). 

Everything I've ordered there has been good. Today I did takeout and they got it right plus it was good. I have to say this is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. Plenty of parking on main street and I think they have a parking lot in the back but I've never had to use. 

There's a lot of little shops of interest in that area, so one might get some free entertainment before or after dinner. If you have time to kill."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an hole-in-the-wall LA style Mexican restaurant, look no further! In my opinion, delicious Mexican restaurants in Vegas are few and far between. I've been here a few times, just with my husband and with large groups of friends, and have not been let down. 

The food is yummy and the margaritas are yummier! I like that the guacamole is served in a mini tortilla shell, that way you can enjoy every last bit of it. Service is quick and the atmosphere is festive. It's actually borderline \"disney-fied.\" It's almost over the top but not quite. If you enjoy first Friday but would like to sit and eat before walking around, this is the perfect spot to do that, located right on Main Street. There is metered parking out front, but it also has a private lot. 

On my most recent visit, I enjoyed the beef enchilada with a chicken taco and my husband enjoyed the nachos. We both partook in jumbo margaritas. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"The first time we came here the food was salty and inedible. Since then we have given it another shot, and this is now our go to downtown Mexican food spot. The food is pretty good. Aside from the staff dumping cleaning supplies on the floor next to our table while we were eating this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"First time here, friendly staff, great service and equally great food. The guacamole was awesome. The decor is very quaint and the the carne asada was good.  I would definitely recommend it, it was a great deal, especially with the coupon I found on restaurants.com. It's a little far from where I live in the southwest, but the friendly staff and good food make it well worth the drive."}
{"text":"We came a week or so ago on a Sunday afternoon, service was crazy good. The staff was fast and friendly. Prices are very reasonable. We started with chips and guac. Of course salsa comes complimentary. The guac was perfect , and paired perfectly with their warm chips. 
   Next we had chicken chimiganga, and chicken enchiladas. The chicken was juicy and perfect, the portions were big , and everything was cooked just right.

  This is located on main street downtown, so there is plenty to do when you decide to go. I love the history around this place, there is a lot to look at while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"I live in LA and I always look for good food in Las Vegas. I've been to at least seven restaurants and this is the best tasting and authentic some are real expensive .this restaurant is perfect for the family plates are an average 10$ per plate."}
{"text":"I found this place from a bartender at the hotel we were staying at, we asked him where does he go for good Mexican food.  The service was excellent as we had a large party.  Margaritas are large and really good.  I ordered the special and had to split it with my husband it was really great food.  We ordered the special with pork and it came with the taco, burrito, beans and rice and the food was awesome.  It was a large plate of food.

We tried to go to dinner on a second trip to Vegas and we couldn't find parking and we circled for at least 10 minutes.  We gave up and I was disappointed.  My husband decided to try again for late lunch the next day and we got it. Yay!!!!

Food was as good as the last trip and service fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I used to love casa Don Juan until I came here yesterday. Everything seemed so different and the food was only ok. There was nothing special about the food and I am sure I could find something better here in vegas. The chips seemed to be a little old and the bean dip and cheese dip came out a little cold...  The waiter wasn't great and seemed to disappear when we needed napkins and forks. 
Something is different :( probably won't be coming back for awhile! 
Reason why I'm giving 4 stars is because they came out and sang happy birthday with maracas and a sombrero ! The cake they gave me was also pretty good ! Other than that, it wasn't the greatest... :("}
{"text":"Casa Don Juan enchants with it's festively cozy ambience which feeds the eyes when waiting for your orders. It's not just the epitome of cuisine with culture. The service is brisk in addition to never being flawed as every waiter I've experienced is competent like I would expect for how busy the restaurant can be due to the flavorful fiesta of food that's there  drawing people back. The general aura of this restaurant is a combination of comfortable and invigorating - that quality with great food is all you need. Excelente!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy my food here, but my enchiladas didn't taste the Michoacán way. The sauce was obviously from a can. My boyfriend had the fajitas which were pretty good. The salsa and guacamole were also delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic place.  I was hoping the michelada would be better, but it wasn't horrible.   Prices are slightly higher than what one would expect.  Food is good.  I would recommend visiting."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! And the service is fast! I was so surprised by how much I enjoyed this place. The chicken tamale was incredible. Worth every penny!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been dining at Casa Don Juan for nearly 20yrs. I fell in love with this place the very first time I went there. Had the pleasure of meeting the owner and his lovely wife, who always made the best flan for me on my birthday! Don Juan was always very welcoming it just felt like I was always with family whenever I'd dine here!
****TODAY****
I Brought a friend here for lunch to celebrate her birthday it was her first time at Casa Don Juan. She liked the decore and atmosphere.
 I was a bit disappointed for the first time ever.
It felt like we were rushed, my friend ordered a tostada de ceviche but didn't have a chance to tell our waiter ( Alfredo)  what kind she wanted, he brought her fish. She wanted shrimp she didn't want to complain. I asked for A Vuelve a la Vida which is a very expensive and got mostly juice not much shrimp or octopus in it and it was salty. I didn't want to send it back never had to do it before.
I didn't recognize any of the workers seems like everyone is new?!?!
I was a little disappointed with the food but the staff was nice and friendly just need to make sure of what the customer wants. I will be visiting the new location in the near future and won't let this bad experience ruin my opinion of the restaurant, still love this place and will forever be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"My five stars is for them having the best hard shelled tacos I've had in Vegas!
Aside from that, the food is good and the service is great. My boyfriend ordered a michilada. He absolutely did not like it so he complained. Juan came out to apologize, and said he would take it back and attempt to make it the way my boyfriend liked it, spicy and full of flavor. When Juan came out with the new michilada, he did not disappoint. My boyfriend says it's THE BEST michilada he's had in this city. GREAT SERVICE! We will definitely be back for the michiladas & tacos!"}
{"text":"I was feeling like eating Mexican food on the way back from my long trail run at Lake Las Vegas to Summerlin, and since I was going to pass all those Mexican neighborhods, I called my Mexican friend to recommend me a good Mexican place in that part of town.

As usual, she replies \"none\", you have to make them from home, but she did mention a few places and since Don Juan was pretty closed off of 515 that I was on, I decided to come here.  

It was reassuring when half of the parking lot was filled with Nissans.  Mexican folks seem to love Nissans.  The interior was strangely filled with Frida Kahlo stuff.  I was somewhat uncomfortable being surrounded by unibrow paintings but I got used to it.  

Chips with salsa/bean dip, tostadas with ceviche, carne asada burrito plate.  

The burrito was FULL of carne asada, unlike stuff you get at typical chain places where you find a few pieces of meat among a LOT of rice and beans.  It was the opposite and VERY filling.  Ceviche was good, but I'm more used to central American type of ceviche where there are big chunks of fish, but all of the fish ceviches I've had at Mexican places seem to have small, flaky sort of fish, but it was good in a different way.  

Depsite my running 8+ miles and having an enormous appetite, I did not have space left for tamales that were ordered so I had to take them home.  

All in all, I liked the food and I would definitely go back there."}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden gems off of the Las Vegas Strip that should be known by everyone who loves authentic Mexican food. If you travel to Vegas and have a car (wouldn't really recommend a taxi ride, but hey, to each his own), you need to come to Casa Don Juan!

Since there isn't a single place on the strip that offers authentic mexican at a decent price, my family and I always head over here at least once during our Vegas stay. Although slightly overpriced (it IS still Vegas), you can get a very decent sized meal for $15-$20. 

I always judge a mexican restaurants' credibility off of ONE FACTOR - their RICE! Most mexican joints have either rice that's too dry/wet or too bland. The rice at Casa Don Juan had that perfect blend of spices and was just the right consistency. I purposefully saved it until the end so that I could end my meal with a bang!

The food itself is pretty good in general. They have all the regulars like combination plates and specialties, but they also have tamales everyday (which is not very common). They're pretty good as well and offer about 5-6 varieties."}
{"text":"So friendly and very fast service. The guacamole is amazing and fresh however it us pricey at 6.00.my husband had a burrito with asada. He loved it . It filled him up. Their salsa is slow very good. They serve a been dip for free, yummy! I ordered the chili Reno and cheese enchilada I was so full I only are half of the Chilli. Took all the rest to go. So good! I will come back to try more!"}
{"text":"Returned again for dinner before First Friday and enjoyed the nice evening October weather by sitting outside. 

Service was a dud this time, with our one waiter and one busboy running all around town.  It took forever to get our order in, to get plates, to get our check, to pay for the bill, etc.  Service was just lacking altogether.  By the time we did get our plates (which we had requested early on), our food was not hot.  Reminders about more chips, beans, and salsa were forgotten.

Food was still good though!  Chips with warm refried beans and cheese and hot salsa are always a joy to munch on here.  Our party of three ordered a few dishes to share.

* Carnitas de Puerco con guacamole, arroz, frijoles y pico de gallo ($8.99) - Generous amount of shredded pork.  More than enough for one person.  And it was moist and tasty, not dry at all.

* 3 Enchiladas de Pollo con arroz y frijoles ($9.99) - It was good, not my favorite of the bunch. I spent more time eating everything else.  We chose the chicken for all three, although you can get beef or cheese as well.

* Carne Asada (estilo Casa Don Juan) con arroz, frijoles y guacamole ($10.99) - A decent size piece of steak covered with onions.  It took forever to cut with the butter knife they give.  They either have to cut it in strips or give you a steak knife so you can cut into it better.

We also ordered three micheladas.  But the waiter said it's called something else when there's hot sauce in it.  I forgot.  Oh well.  But it was pretty good nonetheless.

There was a slight discrepancy with the bill where they charged us for another beer.  It's always a pain to find things added on your bill and having to get them to fix it.  So double check your bill when dining here.

Overall, it's still a great place for Mexican food with great atmosphere.  Wonderful people watching when sitting outside, but it always seems lively when I pop in to use the loo.  (Not sure how the atmosphere outside would be should it not be First Friday.)

3.5 stars.

(Pics posted from our dinner!)"}
{"text":"This is coming from a Mexican, the place has a lot of different dishes for everyone (vegetarian, pork, chicken, seafood) and it may take you a bit to choose a dish! It gets very busy during lunch hour, so I recommend making a reservation or arriving early. The chips and tortillas are all fresh and they do have spicy plates as well!

And being a Frida Kahlo fan, I LOVE eating right by the wall that's full of her greatness!

This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants. I wish I lived closer to this great restaruant! :)

LOL, I recommend ignoring reviews from SoCal people. They're Mexican food spoiled over there and just love to bash LV Mexican places. :P"}
{"text":"The hostess was rude. But the server was great and always made sure we had everything we needed. I had the carne asada tacos and the meat was delicious! I loved that they put guac on them! Tasted the fried ice cream which was also delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is legit!

Not on the strip, but worth the (short) drive

We got guacamole, beans and chips to start. Tasty! 

Menu has tons of good options, but ultimately went with coctel de camaron and agua de piña. It was perfect! Taste was great, and I didn't feel so stuffed at the end of the meal. 

Servers are great, very polite and friendly - make you feel like you're visiting a relative. I also liked the decor of the place, makes it look authentic without trying too hard."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere, outstanding decor and good service.  This location located can get crowded during peak hours and is a popular Mexican restaurant in the 18b. 

Complimentary chips and salsa are provided and the upsell of the guacamole has seemed to stop after more than a few complaints. 

Enchiladas, tacos, nachos and burritos are my typical go-to here with the shredded beef burrito being my favorite. 

After a evening of running around downtown and the 18b you don't have to run for the border but you do have to get to get to California & Main St. 

Free limited parking is located behind the restaurant on California or available street parking after 6pm."}
{"text":"Came here to eat for my boyfriends 21st birthday lunch, as soon as we walked in we were immediately seated which I was thrilled about. THEN right when we sat down they already brought us chips & salsa & asked for our drinks, then took our order. We were literally only in the restaurant for 15 min & our entree was already on our table!! I was blown away! Everyone who passed our table asked if we needed anything. Best service I've ever received EVER!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. Best carnitas in town! Service was excellent. Our server Ivan took good care of us. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"So sad to be giving this restaurant only 3 stars but I do so because of the margaritas we ordered. It lacked tequila, so much that I ended up getting a shot of Don Julio. So disappointing. 

On the bright side, I am ordered a wet Assad's burrito and thought it was great. Probably one of the best I've had. I'd recommend this place but only for the food, not the jumbo margaritas."}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner here, with friendly and polite staff. Great atmosphere, nice affordable prices and staff that really cares. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love everything about this place!  Great Margaritas , Food  & Staff ! Atmosphere is awesome. The lady making the fresh tortillas right in front is great to watch her preform her craft. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed and have only had great success in introducing others to the restaurant. If you are visiting from elsewhere, this is an opportunity to leave the usual Las Vegas hustle and bustle. If you live in Las Vegas - you probably already eat here!"}
{"text":"Following our round of drinks at Velveteen Rabbit, the wife and I walked a few doors down for some Mexican food at Casa Don Juan. I'm far from an expert on the finer points of authentic Mexican cuisine, so I went in with an open mind and an empty stomach.  Casa Don Juan had all of the familiar earmarks of a family-run operation.  The dining room was cozy, clean, and colorful, albeit a bit gaudy replete with Mexican tchotkes and neon cerveza signs.  Service was fast and familiar as the complimentary chips and sauce were delivered promptly to our table.  We added an order of guacamole for our chips.  The guac was smooth and fresh, good, but fairly standard fare.  It may have been a bit more enjoyable if it had been made fresh tableside.  No worries, though, because my order of Menudo (available only on Sat. & Sun) was exactly what the doctor ordered.  The generous amount of tender beef tripe was swimming in a delicious chile infused broth.  The dish was fortified with hominy and accompanied by a plate of chopped cilantro, lime, onions, black pepper, and oregano add-ins.  It was hearty and flavorful and a big winner in my mind.  While there likely are whole list of Mexican restaurants that the locals know of that are superior to Casa Don Juan, the wife and I found it to be satisfying and a solid value."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I come to Vegas. Honestly the food is great but the service is amazing. Always leave happy!"}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVED this place (even with our Groupon deal)!  

-Great Food 
-Great Service 

Only con: Parking - some street parking available 

Price a little on the higher end, but totally worth it!  

I don't usually rate places with Groupon deals this high, so it says a lot for a place...
This is our Favorite Mexican restaurant so far in Las Vegas...hands down!"}
{"text":"Team building is always great for bringing your coworkers and building a positive team and family spirit among employees. On this day, we decided to have an event at the Plaza hotel bingo hall, which turned out to be a flop. Although no one won that day, we sure did build up an appetite. The choices were Thai or Mexican. Mexican won, so our boss told us about this family owned local joint down the road from the Plaza. I'm always up for the opportunity to Yelp a new restaurant, this was no different.

Driving down Main St, you'll see the restaurant on the right hand side, adorn with exposed rock walls. There's a small parking lot in the back or street parking, but get there early so you can secure a spot. When you walk in, the website says you're treated to \"home-like Mexican setting.\" It's more like a Mexican Quinceañera threw up! The walls are a bright canary yellow, the ceiling is lined with hanging colored paper, cut with different designs. Definitely looks like an outdated joint but somehow, that's their character and it seems to work. Our server was passable. Didn't really converse with us and we ended up waiting  a long time for out check at the end. Thank goodness I was surrounded with great company!

For dinner, I decided to get the number 10 on the dinner menu, Carnitas de puerco con guacamole, arroz, frijoles y pico de gallo for $11.99. This dish is pork, guacamole, rice, beans and pico de gallo. For some reason, Mexican prepared pork is always a winner in my book. This pork was nicely prepared, shredded and nicely marbleized. The meat was tender, however, drowned in oil. The saving grace was definitely the mild, yet flavorful taste. The rice was a nice dry compliment to the dish and help to soak up the juices from the pork. I thought the pico brought a fresh taste to the dish and who doesn't love guac! Overall, this dish was great.

At the end of the day, I would say I'm more of a 3.5 out of 5 stars for this place.I appreciate it's history and character, however, I feel like some things could be updated. Aside from the mediocre service, I would say the rest of the evening was a delightful one. I'm glad that it's close to work. For that alone, I wouldn't mind coming back again for another crack at it!"}
{"text":"The service was great we had a older gentlemen I didn't catch his name but he was very helpful and pleasant. The food was pretty good well worth going back a second time we are even planning on bring my sister and her family here. The only thing I didn't like was the fact the young hostess dress top was COMPLETELY see threw. With the men diners that may be great but it is a family friendly and I would not like bring my kids here. It was shocking. When I say see threw I mean I could tell size color and style of bra."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Friday.  Arrived at 11:30am and place was already filling up.  Service was fast and friendly.  Nice chips, salsa, and bean dip are complimentary.

Food was fresh and abundant.  I order the 3 soft taco lunch special.  This could easily be split between 2 people. 

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is great the atmosphere is wonderful...and the BARTENDER is THE B-E-S-T!!!!  She is the most friendliest funniest bartender I've come across in a while. And that girl can make a mean drink! She is the reason I'm giving 5 stars! I wish I could remember her name cute little Doll works in the evenings...she's the Best seriously!"}
{"text":"Very nicely owned family restaurant. Waiters & servers well mannered & also the dinning was great. Food.. WAS GREAT. Although they did mess up my burrito w sour cream (im vegan) they provided a new one w no charge & very fast. They take family photos & just provide excellent service will come back."}
{"text":"First off when we arrived we were told that it was shift change so we couldn't be seated right away. We waited for 15 minutes while people just hung around the hostess stand chatting. Then we sat down and I ordered a frozen margarita which was brought on the rocks. When it was sent back I suspect it was brought back to me after having just been run through a blender and having ice added to it. Pretty much just tasted like ice. Food was fast, but blah and then we had to wait 30 minutes for our check. Finally, after paying at the register I was waiting for my partner to go to the bathroom and our waiter came up to see how much he got tipped. I don't think he realized that I was the person standing right there. You just waited on us! What the hell? Overall- don't do it if you can avoid it."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for a wonderful dinner! The food was fantastic and the service was impeccable! Such a friendly and attentive staff!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best mexican restaurant here in las vegas! I live far from this place but still make the far drive just to have my Carne Asada. mucho bueno! Also order their Horchata it will quence your thirst! The staff are very friendly and the food overall is great! I had my 25th Bday here. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"When my wife friends come visiting from minneapolis, they decided they wanted to try auththentic mexican cuisine or their last day. So I bring them here having never been here myself. 

Definetely exceeded my expectation. Great shrimp with garlic combo and I try their carne asada which were marinated perfectly. All and all a perfect combination of mexican food without getting their item burned or undercook meat or overcook meat. I really enjoyed my meal here. Definetely a fan."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times, so I can't believe that I haven't reviewed them before!  We recently took advantage of the Groupon for Casa Don Juan and had dinner and 2 large frozen Margaritas.  The chips come with beans and salsa which are both very good.  I had a combo plate with a Crispy Beef Taco, Chili Relleno and Pork Tamal.  Hubby had the #31 which is the same as what I had but instead of the Tamal, it comes with a beef enchilada.  The beef they use is really tasty and the Relleno's are the best in Vegas.  The food is always very hot, fresh and delicious...our favorite Mexican food option."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!! The portions are big for a reasonable price. I came in for lunch. Raul was my server. Great service. The manager Aurelia was really sweet. Definitely will come again."}
{"text":"We love, love, love, this place!!!!!!  When ever our family comes in from Orange County this is the first place they want to hit!!  The food is great and the service is great!  We never have to wait long to get seated, order, or for our food.  Make sure you order flour tortilla they are AWESOME!! We always go though a few orders of those.  Also the pina colada is served in a real pineapple."}
{"text":"Such great service and really nice people. The food was amazing. I'm going to have to roll out of here. They started off with bringing us guacamole. So good and then the meal was awesome. Next time I'm
Back in Vegas I'll be here."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant by looking on Groupon for dinner deals in Vegas. The Groupon being offered was for 2 dinner entrees (up to $12.99) and 2 jumbo margaritas for $27 (a $46 value). Ideally, we wouldn't have purchased a Groupon for a place so far from where we were staying on the strip, but it was a pretty good deal and decided to give it a try. As we were driving to this restaurant, our Lyft driver was surprised that we wanted to go to a place so far off the strip but reassured us that it was authentic Mexican food. We had high hopes and expectations for this place. 

First negative of this dining experience was the location. Not only was a 15 minute Lyft ride but they were doing construction all around the restaurant, so the drop off/pick up is really inconvenient. 

Once we got inside the restaurant, the friendly hostess seated us and offered us guacamole or bean dip to start instead of the complementary salsa, but we decided to go with the salsa. Our short interaction with her was the end of the positive customer service we received during the rest of our time at this restaurant. 

Our waiter, whose name I don't recall, came to take our drink order and was friendly to begin with. Once I mentioned that we would be using a Groupon, his whole tone and body language towards us changed immediately. He said, with an attitude, we could only get the house flavor margarita or we had to pay an additional cost for a flavor upgrade. We said that was fine, and we had no problem paying the $1.50 difference for a strawberry instead of lime flavor. He then proceeded to whip open the menus for us and directed us to the two pages of dinner entrees we were allowed to pick from. I was highly disappointed in their lack of vegetarian options, but was not about ask if I could sub veggies instead of the chicken, beef, pork, etc. due to our waiter's poor attitude. I decided on fish tacos and my boyfriend chose one of their burritos. 

The restaurant was not too busy when we came in but by the time we placed our order, our waiter had a couple tables in addition to ours. Our food took an average amount of time to be prepared. 

After our food was brought out, that was the last time anyone checked on us throughout our meal. The food came out hot, and was very tasty and fresh. By the time our meals came, my boyfriend and I were over half way done with our margaritas and waters, and figured our waiter would be over to offer us another round of drinks. We spent 20 minutes enjoying our meal and in that time frame, our waiter did not once come to check on our drinks, how our food was, etc. After we finished eating, we sat at our table for close to 15 mins waiting for the bill while our waiter completely ignored us. While I realize he had a couple other tables, I've have never had an experience with a waiter/waitress who couldn't juggle 4 tables. There were multiple times he looked over at us and I made eye contact with him to signal that we were ready to cash out, yet he turned his back to us each time. At one point, I was going to ask the hostess to print our bill off so we could get out of there. He must have sensed that we were growing increasingly impatient and finally came to our table and said \"is everything okay?\" in a snippy tone. At this point, we were very disappointed. Our original plan was to order another drink before we left, but based off of how we were treated, we told him to bring the bill. 

After our waiter applied the Groupon, all we were left to pay was the taxes and up charge on the margarita flavor, which came out to be around $9. I know that when using Groupons/coupons, the correct thing to do is to tip on the original price, not the discounted price. This experience, however, made me so upset that I was VERY tempted to tip on the $9 that we owed. However, being the decent human beings we are, we tipped him on what the meal should've cost without the Groupon. 

Maybe our waiter was having an off day, but I don't believe this was the case. He probably thought we were going to short him out of a decent tip as we were using a Groupon. If he did not want to take care of a table with a Groupon, he should've asked another waiter to take care of us. Instead, we were treated like garbage. We will not be back to this place when we visit vegas again."}
{"text":"There is a new Casa Don Juan in Summerlin on Buffalo that has the same great service, good food, and moderate prices as the one downtown."}
{"text":"Tried this place out today after hearing my husband talk about it for a year. This was both our first time. I had the vegetarian burrito and my husband had the shredded beef burrito enchilada style with a beef taco. We had the sopapillas for dessert. The service was fantastic. The servers all work together to keep up on the drinks and keep asking you if you need anything else. The food was good but expensive for Mexican food. The service was definitely the shining star here."}
{"text":"Casa Don Juan is always my go to spot when I head to vegas. great friendly service and delicious food. MENUDO is a must!!!! Jose and Gregorio are the best. always welcomed with a smile and remember us."}
{"text":"This place was unbelievable. I ordered a burrito and it came with nothing but tongue. It didn't come with any condiments at all! I was charged a whole dollar just for a small amount of sour cream. The meat was not tender at all and it was actually the nastiest burrito I ever had. Please listen to your customers and give them what they pay for. I've never paid $10 for a shit burrito. Robertos is way better."}
{"text":"Really good flavors.  All meat burrito with steak was nothing but lean meat flavored to perfection."}
{"text":"It's almost not fair to leave this review, because I've been here before, and the food was really good. 

However, on this visit, on a cool spring night, we came in for dinner and it was really hot. So hot, we closed out and didn't finish our drinks."}
{"text":"I ordered cheese enchiladas, looked like most of what was on my plate was microwaved. The sides of the enchilada tortilla were hard.

I ordered potatoes on the side, they weren't even seasoned. They didn't look appealing either. 
I had one bite because there was no taste. 

Ordered guacamole, it's not fresh FYI - meaning they don't make it by your table. They bring it out already served in a large tortilla chip cup but it has no taste. I added salt and pepper to make it somewhat better."}
{"text":"Another great lunch time place. There is a wide variety of food on the menu. The service is usually very quick (in and out in less than an hour at lunch time). There is a different lunch special everyday. The red sauce on the enchiladas is divine."}
{"text":"Bomb.com literally sat down had three people on us.... drinks,  chips, salsa, guac... right away... food was on point,  server super friendly... incredible meal"}
{"text":"Beware of this restaurant !  My brother , sister and I are here on vacation and ate at this restaurant based on a recommendation.  The food is awful and that is putting it nicely !!!   After finishing dinner and almost arriving back at the hotel about 40 minutes later I became violently ill and was sick for several hours .  That night my brother also became really sick .  We each had a different entree .  The food all seems to pretty much look the same no mater what you order , and tastes unlike any other Mexican food I have ever  eaten .  Please avoid this restaurant unless you want to take a big chance on getting sick .  Consider yourself warned !!!! We have since heard from others that this place is nasty and you are not really sure what you are eating .  I wish someone would have warned me too ."}
{"text":"Be sure that if you have a group on that you show and tell the waiter , the  host and the owner what's in your group ticket   If you don't they will try to over charge you and \"Assume\" you want the extras and charge you! This is so upsetting all of the above were rude , unprofessional and especially the manager , threatening to call the police when they were in the wrong , after all that they waived the extra charges because Assuming to call the police was not putting a scare into us when they were in the wrong!!'"}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times. I usually eat lunch from the lunch specials. I find the service quick and friendly. They usually can get you in and out in 30min. The service is friendly from the greeting Neil the exit."}
{"text":"My company and I always have lunch here because the food and service is always on point. The ambiance is very authentic and you genuinely feel as though you're somewhere in Mexico! My favorite dishes include the Chile's rellenos, the lengua en salsa verde, and the quest dip!! And don't forget to try the homemade tortillas! 

PS- Parking can be kinda weird, but not impossible start on the northwest corner of the street for best parking and then move your way west. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We were told about this place by a casino worker at Excalibur so we took their word and went. Boy was it a good idea. 

We were greeted by a lady in a traditional dress who seated us. There were 4 of us by the way.

Started off with chips and salsa, beans and guacamole. Chips were good, not greasy as was the beans. The salsa and guacamole tasted canned but were still decent. 

We bought a selection of soups, cocktails, tacos and ceviche. 

The soup was deliciously flavored, well spiced. The cocktail was served in a large soup bowl and was equally as good. It was a sea food cocktail. The taco's just disappeared, with fresh tilapia fillet. Ceviche was mixed with fish, shrimp and octopus on q huge plate. I struggled to eat it all, it was so good I couldn't help it. 

It was a friend's birthday so a group of about 5 employees sang for her, they were really loud and into it. Very entertaining. 

4 stars because many simple ingredients were not fresh."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food.  They are always quick and fast.  We always come here after our stay in Vegas."}
{"text":"Man, I really wanted to like the house that Don Juan built partially because I want there to be really amazing restaurants downtown and partially because I've always thought it looked so festive. From the outside, it often looks as if it is glowing. As you know, I love an atmosphere that makes a statement, and I can definitely appreciate festive.

I went for dinner with a group after a talk at the Historic 5th Street School. It is an adorable little place with bright walls, tiled floors and lots of wall flare. Although we arrived only an hour before they were closing, the servers were welcoming. There were only a couple of other tables of diners.

The server brings salsa, bean dip and chips to the table. I would say that all were average. My friends had eaten at Don Juan before, and one ordered the chile relleno based on his previous experience. My other friend ordered two tacos, and I ordered a plate with one taco and one tamale. 

Perhaps I ordered poorly because the taco was solid, but the tamale was sad. Sad tamales are really sad. It was a weird diameter--I know that is an odd comment, but it was like a toilet paper roll, but a little shorter. I like a flatter tamale because it prevents them from drying out. Don Juan's tamale was very dry, and there was a lot of dough, not too much filling. Plus, it was lukewarm at best. I guess most of this could have been the result of it being a late in the day tamale. However, even early in the day it would have still been the same diameter with the same fillings, so, naaaah, I think it was simply a sad, little tamale. Hence, my sad little two stars."}
{"text":"This place is out of the way. Most people will never run across this place because of its location.  This place typically is filled with locals through the week.
Food - A+
Service - A+
Atmosphere - A+
I live in Southern California (the Mecca of Mexican food), and this place would put many restaurants in my area out of business. My last trip up I took my wife and daughter.  It is never easy to get them to agree on a place, but we barely had conversation during our meal.  We were all just eating a perfect meal. Fajitas are great and the topper.....Home made tortillas. These tortillas are so good, fresh, warm, delicious.  It really makes the difference.
Good Job Casa Don Juan!"}
{"text":"Anyone who gives this place anything less than 5 stars needs to reevaluate their priorities in life!  I've been eating at Casa Don Juan for years and the food has never changed and is always top notch!

We were promptly seated and asked if we want cheese dip of guac.  Of course we said yes to the guac!  Your crazy if you don't say yes!!  I love that the cost is \"market price\" like we are ordering a lobster or something.  It's not crazy expensive and so worth the $5.95 we paid.  The chips and salsa were brought out quickly along with our drink order.

My mom enjoyed her meal as did I.  I ordered the \"super burrito\" with chili verde.  It was the perfect amount of spicy.  It was gigantic and I was only able to eat less than half for I was full from the bomb chips and dips!  We had margaritas to add to the great meal!  

The service is always great!  They are friendly and give you the feeling that they are pleased you are there dining with them.  Even the guys who fill your water and refill your chips are friendly and efficient!

They have a small outdoor dining area which would be ideal on a First Friday!  Parking is ample both in front and out back.  

Don't listen to the negative ninnies on this place!  They don't know good Mexican food!  Can't wait for my hubs to bring me back here for our anniversary next week"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited on 12/29/16. We were immediately greeted and seated. Ivan was our server and he was totally awesome! He accomodated us in every way and recommended new things . Joel brought us our drinks and refilled our chips at least 4 times! Thanks Joel!! My boyfriend had the pork con chile verde, and it came with rice and beans and it was so darn good! I had a carnitas burrito enchilada style double rice ! And paired it with two margaritas! Pretty much everything you try here is spectacular! And the service is just a plus! We'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food in town! The food is wonderful and the margaritas are delicious! The staff is very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"This is the BEST authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas. Ivan is amazing. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"It's just ok, nothing exciting on the menu. Be careful when you sit down the staff is trained to upsale you with guacamole. Your food comes out so fast so they can turn the table. Salsa is very good. They try to take your picture for purchase.. Very tourist type move locals don't appriciate."}
{"text":"Guacamole is yummy!!!! :D

I LOVE coming here to eat breakfast on the weekends. It's the perfect place to eat if you have a hangover too (Menudo), quiet, and no wait if you go between 9am-11am.... So my favorite meal to eat is JUEVOS RANCHEROS $9.. Now I must warn you, they give a very big proportion of food no matter which plate you get. I recommend either one of these plates: the NOPALES, JUEVOS RANCHEROS, CHILAQUILLES, AND you have to try A SIDE OF GUACAMOLE. Their guacamole is made a little differently than most places, no tomatoe, but diced onions and cilantro- YUM!! Aside from the good food, the staff is super friendly, helpful, and always on top of things like filling up your drink, getting you napkins or picking up your plate. You're most likely going to spend about $8-$16 per plate, a little pricey, but well worth it I think :)"}
{"text":"I think out of all the places I ate at this weekend; this one was my favorite! The margaritas were great and our food came out fast yet hot! I had the chicken enchiladas and my boy friend had the chicken green burrito. Both were great! We also tried their piña colada and that was beyond amazing ! Great place to visit! The waiters were so friendly and nice; I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Didn't even get water before they told us that their machines were down and could only take cash, how about telling us that when we walked in before you say us.
Very unapologetic about it & we were starved.  Not sure it's a ploy to use their ATM but we don't pay $5 to get cash.
I'm sure their food is great but service is lacking."}
{"text":"Went with a group of about 10 girls for 5 de mayo. We had reservations and our table was ready for us as our arrival staggered. The salsa was addicting hot and the bean dip was pretty good too. We ordered our drinks and my frozen margarita tasted more like water, sent it back. My friend sitting across me literally waited for about 20 minutes for her beer and we had to remind them. The whole time we were confused as to who our server / busser was, there was like 4 different people servicing our table.  

The piña colada looked pretty cool as it is served literally in a pineapple. I ordered the pescado frito 'fried fish' and it was good. 

Overall, service was crap, food was your normal for a Mexican restaurant but it's a little bit over priced. The ambiance was fun and we were there to get drunk and have a good time, and we definitely did."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants. I always look forward to coming to this restaurant. Margaritas are a little more bitter than most so I just get something other Han that but the food is amazing! And the staff is always so friendly and very attentive.... Even when it's a crazy Cinco De Mayo day!!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this Mexican restaurant was a success. We were greeted and seated promptly even though it was busy and we had 6 in our party. Our orders were likewise taken quickly, and our food came out FAST, maybe even a little too fast! There is something I don't say often! 

The food is fresh and extremely varied, also quite tasty. The chile relleno was stuffed with plenty of cheese, but for me, the batter was a bit thick. Tacos were wonderful and the red sauce on my enchilada was delicious. I wouldn't call this place tex-mex at all, seemed pretty authentic to me!"}
{"text":"Food here was alright. We got the tongue salsa verde and beef torta. The tongue plate was huge! At 13.99$ I'm glad it was that big. The flavor of the salsa verde was actually pretty good but the tongue was pretty average. The torta was alright kinda small and the bread was more like flat bread. The happy hour drinks were a little disappointing too. It was 9.99$ for two small margaritas. I can see why this place is 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Atmosphere like my families parties but my family wasn't there!  Super friendly and nice.They had singing the night we were there.We got huevos rancheros,chile relleno and our friend carne asada or something like that.All mouthwatering and the homemade flour and corn tortillas hot and fresh.I will definatley keep going back."}
{"text":"I had never been here before, but my friend and her husband go there all the time and love it.  We got a groupon and went for dinner.  The groupon was for two dinner entrees (for up to $12.99 per meal) and two jumbo margaritas.  

We told the server right away and he seemed annoyed.  We ordered margaritas and was told it was only the house lime; no flavors were included as those were extra.  When we got our margaritas, my friend had a black bug in hers.  We flagged down our waiter and he didn't apologize or anything. He just said \"Oh. I can get you another one.\"  Our food came out which was good, but the server never came to see how our dinner was, the bus boy did though who was very nice.  After we finished, the server came over to bring us our check and we have him our groupon.  When he brought it back, the groupon didn't cover all of it and we had only ordered exactly what was on the groupon.  The check indicated that only $45.97 was applied.  We checked the groupon fine print to make sure that there wasn't a maximum dollar value that we missed and there wasn't.  We asked the server why there was still a $12 balance and he couldn't give us an answer.  So we took it up to the front to the cashier and asked nicely to speak with the manager.  She said there was a maximum value on it but we asked where that was indicated.  She said it was in the fine print, but when we showed her the fine print, it was not there and she could not find it.  She didn't want to help us and felt annoyed that we were asking about it. Finally after her reading the fine print for another few minutes said \"oh well it should be in there\".  She didn't apologize at all and finally changed our bill to the correct amount where we just owed tax and tip.  She blamed it on groupon saying that the price in things have changed and that groupon didn't reflect that.  The food was just okay but the customer service was absolutely awful!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday afternoon and ordered 
1. Super burrito - 14
2. Enchilladas - 11
For $5 (Used the $10 Groupon for $20) 

- Horrible parking! Luckily, after a 2nd round, someone pulled out so we swept in. It looks like that other customers parked on street. 
- Busy. We came during lunch hour and had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. 
- Groupon lunch special was only valid for lunch entrees. Cheapest Lunch entree was 11, so the value of actual $20 is diminished. 
- Love the Chips and Dip! Dip comes with both salsa and beans! This is the first Mexican restaurant where they gave beans for free! 
- Large portions. 
- Fast and friendly service. Everything went smoothly. 
- Super burrito and Enchillada were satisfying. Lots of beef. 
- Comparable to Legit SoCal Mexican fast-food (Pepe, Molca salsa, etc...) but you get the whole dining in experience."}
{"text":"I eat Mexican food almost every day of the week and this restaurant is hands down on my top 5 list of favorite places! I live in Cali and when I come to Vegas I eat here over all the fancy restaurants and buffets!!! All the servers are there for the customers and the food comes out fast and fresh !!! Best shrimp ceviche hands down !!!! I can't wait to go back to Vegas so I can get my grub on!"}
{"text":"Went with a Living Social special.  Delicious and fresh Mexican food and margaritas.  There is construction on Main St. That is hurting their business right now, so go support the original Casa Don Juan.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican restaurant I've been to in Vegas so far. I got the wet burrito and it was really good. The beans and guacamole were the best. I also tried pineapple and raisin tamales for the first time and that was good too. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was great. the bartender was attentive and fast."}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. Drinks are a hit or miss but their super burrito is the best burrito in Vegas."}
{"text":"**Summary**
       - Service - The service was great. The waiter was took the initiative and answered all questions we had about the menu.
       - Flavor - Perhaps it was what we ordered, but the food seemed mediocre.
**Ordered**
       - $12.99 Pescado (Veracruz style) - They deep fried a whole fish. It was definitely an experience. However, the fish seemed a bit bland (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg?select=PJHl0-1lr3VutIljvJWAgg).
       - $13.99 Carne Asada con Arroz, Frijoles y Guacomole - The carne asada was decent but a little dry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg?select=2jMekOanf6P9EuTiBzuh0Q).
       - $2.50 Lengua (Beef Tounge) Taco - The meat was good. The only complaint was it was really spicy. I had to stop half way to take a break (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a192hdM0_UVCYLwPJv1Qwg?select=YThhtM8r_BRfN3L56wfKGQ).
       - $2.75 Flan Napolitano - Made from scratch flan. It was delicious.
**Recommendations**
       - Out of all the restaurant style Mexican places, I'd rank this one pretty high. However, I think I'll stick to fast food Tacos El Gordo next time I'm feeling like tacos."}
{"text":"Touted as the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas by my date. We were around here for First Friday and all the other restaurants had an hour to an hour and a half wait. Mexican is never my first choice when it comes to dining options. 

For starters, we got the cheese dip to go with their salsa and bean dip. This is the highlight of the whole meal. I would have been happy to order a few bowls of this and a side of guacamole as my entree. Instead, I got sampler plate. It consisted of a tamale, enchilada, and a taco. I did the pork in red sauce, chicken enchilada, and beef taco. The meat was dry on all three. At this point, I was full anyways.

The margaritas are good. A little more on the sweet side than I would like, but a squeeze of the lime wheel helps. They come in two sizes, regular and the large. You might as well do the fish bowl, because life is better with more alcohol."}
{"text":"You could find a crappy Mexican restaurant like this anywhere in America. Uninteresting menu, slow service, bad decor. The flies would not stay off of our bland enchiladas, so at least THEY enjoyed them. If you want to know what Mexican restaurants were like thirty years ago, you can't do much better than this  relic from a flavorless past."}
{"text":"Quality has gone down. I've been coming here since 2011 and unfortunately it's all about profit now.

My favorite no.37 Chimichanga has shrunk in size. Our party of four had three and all were alot smaller than it used to.

Limes served with drinks were precut and extremely dry. Our party saw five dry lime slices. Not good.

I would say Roberto's is better and cheaper :( owners: please fix the quality."}
{"text":"Had gone to this restaurant couple a times before and never had received worst service ever!!  Server thought we were from out of town ( which my family was but we are locals)  started arguing with my folks.  If they asked for something just like chile sauce, server said he had to put an order for it, what when in a Mexican restaurant has an order for sauce have to be put it; seemed like this server was pissed if we were from out of town?? Don't understand why.  He was so rude and when we left decided to talk to manager same as rude and we were asked where we were from??  Did it matter, we as customers should of been treated right, won't be going back here again!!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I came with a group of 4 mid-week, and it was surprisingly busy. They stuffed the 4 of us into a tiny booth, which was honestly my only gripe about the experience. It was extremely tight for our group of 4 and we are not big people. So comfort-wise they lost a star. Everything else was great though. I had a couple of cucumber margaritas which were insanely delicious and refreshing. We all loved the chips and salsa (ate WAY too many), and we also ordered the queso, which was a bit thin but tasted great. I had a shredded chicken burrito and loved it. I really wanted dessert, especially after seeing all of the cakes on display when we walked in, but we were all way too full. Next time- less chips, more cake! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pork carnitas and cheese quesadilla...will be back soon because my friend got a chimichanga and it looked good but I didn't have any room left."}
{"text":"The over all ambiance was great. The uniforms and the over all look of the place felt amazing! The food was on point the chips and salsa and guacamole we are all amazing! There was even a lady who was making fresh tortillas there to be seen."}
{"text":"We stopped in to try the cucumber and strawberry margaritas... they were the delicious! The bartender was very friendly and extremely helpful! We will definitely be returning here!!!"}
{"text":"They have really good service here, they give you chips, salsa, and beans as soon as you sit. Their salsa's amazing & the food is too. First time i came i ordered crispy tacos, they were delicious and the second time i ordered the wet burrito and it was perfect!  You gotta try em out!"}
{"text":"This place was actually really delicious it's located little bit off the beaten path but it's very good the prices were a little bit high and the cameraman who walked around never gave us our picture but anything besides that was really delicious"}
{"text":"Is a traditional Mexican food restaurant , the servers are really nice  and it has a very  nice decoration :) during a happy birth day son they will put sombreros on all the family members ... Nice pic !! To remember ."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.  No reason to go anywhere else.  Nice size portions at good prices.  Service was excellent with fast refills and the meal arriving fast as well. Can't complain on this one. The place is very clean as well as the rest rooms."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place from pretty much all my friends at some point, so I decided to finally check it out. Super easy to find and the building has a fun, comfy atmosphere. There's not too much parking right near the restaurant, but plenty within walking distance.

We were greeted at the door by a friendly hostess and led to our table. The hostess immediately asked us if we wanted either cheese dip (which I've heard is amazing) or guacamole with our chips and salsa (including bean dip). Being that my friend and I don't respond well to dairy, we opted for the guac. The hostess informed us that it was extra, which we said was fine. Had I known it was almost $6 more, I think I would've said no... super yummy guac, but not worth an extra $6. My friend prefers her guac with more seasoning and additional ingredients, so she thought it was just ok. I love plain guac, so I thought it was delicious. The bean dip was just ok. But I've been spoiled by Leticia's (north side of town) AMAZING bean dip.

Our server was great and attentive. He recommended the piña colada and checked to see the ingredients for us. The piña colada was delicious and just a fun experience! Brought out in a pineapple instead of a glass! For my entrée, I had the one taco meal with carne asada meat. The taco meal was good, but not amazing. Came with beans and spanish rice.

Overall, fun experience and good (not amazing) food. I kind of left feeling like I could've gone to a Mexican fast food place near my house for more food and way cheaper. Or made the drive all the way to Leticia's. Would go again to try a different dish."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. We used groupon with no problems at all. The service was fast and friendly.  The food was hot and tasted fresh.  The salsa was also awesome.  The decor of the place   let's you know you are about to have sone Mexican food."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food.  I had the chicken fajitas and my husband had the chili relenos, enchilada and taco combination.  All of the food was fresh and full of flavor.  The jalapeño margaritas are out of this world.  I wish I wasn't so full from the food because I'd love a second margarita.  The staff was also super courteous and very friendly.   I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Eva is the best bartender! I have had the best time sitting at her bar! And her cucumber margarita is to die for!  She needs a raise and has awesome ideas for the menu!! I will be back!!!!! :-)"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the food here since they opened but am thoroughly disgusted with the over the top high prices. These prices are not inline with other Mexican restaurants of equal or higher quality food. Don't think I will be going back exclusively because of the high prices."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant
Somewhat cold, my friend's wife wanted to wear a sweater.
Staff was very friendly and attentive.
Food was under-seasoned and salsa had no flavor. When we inquired if they had another salsa that was hot, we were charged $1.50 (don't mind the charge) for Habanero salsa that did not do anything except help us spice the rest of the food.
Burrito seemed to have little if any chicken.
Chicken fajita and Beef and shrimp fajita had no flavor.
Took the left overs home, threw in some more onions, salt and pepper. Used green salsa/sauce from another Mexican restaurant and that made it taste good. 
Also the guacamole just had avocado,  rest of the usual ingredients seemed to be missing.
I'm not a connoisseur of Mexican food but this food had little flavor"}
{"text":"Tired and short on cash because the casinos have all your money and the Mexican restaurants in them are too pricey or fake? Take a drive just past the stratosphere hotel and eat here. Do it now and sober up, and take your too tight micro mini skirt wearing girl with you"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food...I had a lengua taco with Chile Relleno... so yummy!"}
{"text":"Showed up here for Valentine's Day dinner and it was not a great visit. We were seated promptly in a quiet area, yay, but then we sat there for upwards of 30 minutes waiting to be greeted and to order our drinks. We had to flag someone down to find out who was serving us. The table immediately next to us was helped many times during the wait. It was not very busy at all when we arrived and still not very busy when we left. 

When we finally ordered I got the beef flautas and it was really disappointing, they were not flautas, they were skinny basic taquitos. Not to dissimilar from the ones you can buy in the frozen food section. I got the mango margarita blended and it was good, nice flavor. The chips and the dips that came out were very good.

I've been to both locations in Las Vegas and this location was truly a let down. Service was not great, and the food was mediocre. I'm glad we used a Groupon but I will not come back to this location again."}
{"text":"We were very happy to find this place, a little unsure of the area since it was dark when we arrived, but the food was amazing, and service was fast and friendly. We will definitely eat here on our next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"I went in for lunch yesterday, reluctantly, since I have been to Casa Don Juan thrice before over the last few years and always order something that I cannot bring myself to eat.  I ordered something different (cheese enchilada and relleno with a side of rice and beans), and this time, it was by far the worst.  The sauce on the enchilada tasted canned (and not even good canned- I happen to like las palmas enchilada sauce), the beans tasted canned, and the relleno could not easily be identified as a relleno.  It was a pile of mush with tasteless red sauce slathered over it.  I am a local and a Mexican, and I have for years and years tried to like this place to support local business, but the mere thought of being invited to lunch here makes me cringe.  Please get better.  I gave them two stars for ambiance and service.  Food alone would've been a zero. Also, please DO NOT insult Mexican food by calling this authentic.  That it is not."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place, but a friend loved it and wanted to go there. There were several of us and we were seated quickly for a busy Saturday night. The restaurant is really large and I had a really good margarita. We had chips and salsa and bean dip. The salsa was thin and spicy. The bean dip was ok.  I originally had beef tacos, beans (only refried) and rice.The beans and rice were ok. That's something that is hard to mess up. The beef tacos were made from shredded beef. I don't care for shredded beef tacos, but that wasn't my complaint. The tortillas for the tacos were so greasy that I couldn't eat them. YUCK!  I ordered an enchilada since I couldn't eat the tacos. There was nothing special about the enchilada. It was big. I'll say that. 

The service was very good. Servers were friendly and attentive. The restaurant is large and can accommodate groups. The problem that I have with large Mexican restaurants that accommodate groups is that the food is usually lacking in quality. I personally feel that this is the case here. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Business diners flock here. On any given lunch hour, you can find district attorneys, police investigators and lawyers dining in the crowded lunch room.

There are a lot of menu choices and the chips and salsa are tasty.  Service is quick.  I found the lunch a bit disappointing as the tortillas were not fresh tasting and the food lacked authentic flavors.  The shrimp was too chewy and the chicken stringy.

The sauces were excellent though and the enchiladas were delicious."}
{"text":"I loved the whole atmosphere and decore. The food was ok, A little disappointed the breakfast ends at 11, should be all day breakfast! I ordered huevos beans, nothing special. Coming from Texas/Mexico border i must say I have tasted better. The staff was excellent, they charged extra for the habanero sauce....the tortillas needed to be cooked a little extra time."}
{"text":"Great mexican food, took my wife and kids and they had a geat time. Food was delicious and service was great. They have the best micheladas anyone can ask for. Thank you fornthe service ans will definitely come back"}
{"text":"When ever we go to the Art's District, to the Majestic Rep or the Cockroach Theater (both nearby), we go to Casa Don Juan.
First, the service is always fast and precise.
Second, the place has an authentic feel about it.  
Third, and most important, the food is always good, well prepared, and inexpensive.
A wonderful Mexican Restaurant in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  We got one drink the entire meal.  I had water and asked for lemon three different times and never got it.  Had three people working our party of 20 and they seemed really overwhelmed. Food was okay but the service could stand an adjustment especially considering the tips they made off us.  We also had someone celebrating a birthday and they charged a $10.00 cake fee for bringing in our own cake."}
{"text":"A-OK...if you are looking for Mexican fare in the immediate area..."}
{"text":"Dang good menudo and homemade tortillas to boot bomb.com when I come up from L.A. this is gonna be my spot service was great"}
{"text":"Every time I go to visit my job site I plan lunch with my girlfriend here. We have been visiting this place since 2007. It is a great find for lunch and dinner. I believe it is some of the best Mexican food in town. 

Lunch can get crowded so we usually get in around 1130 and are seated right away. Get the guac!! It is a little extra but totally worth it. I have never had bad service here and they are very attentive and the food comes out pretty fast. Not fast like microwave, but within a good amount of time for the amount of people they have sitting in there. 

I usually get shredded beef tacos or enchiladas and the love the rice. Everything is just so yummy. Oh yah and the horchata, YUM! I had bad Mexican just days before I came last Friday so I definitely needed the right stuff!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and both times the good is yummy and the waiters are very sweet . The Restaurant itself is very Mexican traditional. I always order a michilada and there super goood! You will love this place!"}
{"text":"Let's be clear, this is Americanized Mexican food, for gringos. There are almost no Mexicans that eat here. That should tell you something. It's not horrible but it's not authentic so if you are a drunk gringo who likes Taco Bell, then you will like this place. Otherwise stay away. The carnitas burrito I had was completely forgettable."}
{"text":"This place is super convenient to work, so we come over often for celebrations. What I enjoy the most is how beautifully decorated and colorful the restaurant is. I am a huge Frida Kahlo fan and they have a her art and photographs all over the restaurant. The atmosphere is lively and fun. You can't help but find yourself in a good mood while dining here. 

The menu is huge and includes everything's you can think of in terms of Mexican food. I really enjoy the flautas, enchiladas, menudo and the Fideo! Food is consistent but not incredible. The margarita's are really tasty though so I would recommend the mango margarita when you stop in. 

One of my coolest experiences at this restaurant was when an all women mariachi band played for Mexican Independence Day! These ladies were simple amazing and oh so talented. I happened to be dining there on this day and was lucky enough to get to see them. 

If you are looking for reasonably priced dining in the downtown area then this place is worth a try!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice - once in 2013 with Justin G. and another with Brian P. yesterday (1/8/15.)

Both times I've been I was highly disappointed. Ridiculous prices (nearly every entree is in the $13.99 - $18.99 range) for what amounts to a big scoop or rice and beans and some packaged nonsense.

First time I came here, I had a soup. This time I had the chicken mole platter with no beans ($13.99.)

I took one bite and could tell that this was prepackaged sauce poured on top of frozen, precut strips of chicken rib meat. 

I asked for more salsa and the waiter said \"okay\" but never brought any more out. 

I noticed the women at the next table were commenting on how the cheese was congealed on their food. I bet the food goes into a salamander partially frozen for that to happen.

This place needs to pare down their menu and prices and focus on preparing a smaller number of menu items exceptionally well. If they started preparing quality food, they wouldn't need a Groupon when they're already an established restaurant."}
{"text":"Yum! I love Mexican food and this is one of my favorite spots to go. We last visited Casa Don Juan with a party of 20. Very large group and they handled us so well. We called and made reservations and the food came out quick. I will always love that they serve bean dip with the free chips and salsa. 

We shared the queso dip, really delicious when mixed with the free bean dip. I had the vegetarian burrito as u was looking for a smaller meal, and could only eat half! Portion sizes are big! 

I also really, really love their in house hot sauce that is on every table. It's super hot!"}
{"text":"We have gone to Casa Don Juan a couple times for breakfast in the last couple months and have enjoyed our meals.  Service is good and attentive."}
{"text":"Wandered in here while shopping some antiques, very happy!  The chips, salsa, and beans were amazing!!!  Our meals were delicious (cheese enchilada and chili reallano combo).  We were worried it would be bust, but how surprised were we!"}
{"text":"I made an online reservation through yelp for cinco de mayo. I received more than one email confirmation and text confirmations about my reservation. Once I arrived they told me they weren't accepting any online reservations.... Well that would have been nice to know before getting my phone blown up with \"confirmations\" that apparently weren't confirming crap! Strike one.

Later I ordered a patron margarita with salt along the rim. Instead of salt, my rim was covered in sugar. Yuck!!! The margarita mix itself was even a nightmare. Never bothered sending my margarita back because the waiter was hardly even around. 

Ordered a wet burrito with green sauce. The food runner brought out my wet burrito with red sauce instead. Didn't bother sending it back because at this point I was done with waiting and was starving. 

Only reason this place gets two stars is because their wet burrito was tasty despite having the wrong sauce.. Won't be back however."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic Mexican food. I'm a Texan and this is in my top 3 places. You have to get a beef taco!"}
{"text":"The food is ALWAYS delicious; staff are friendly and the atmosphere is fun.  My family and I enjoyed a Sunday lunch today.  I had a shrimp cocktail that was loaded with big, plump shrimp.  I also enjoyed a ceviche tostada.  This has to be one of the best Mexican places in the valley."}
{"text":"Menudo, pozole,  great food and prices, when looking for home cooked food and in Vegas a must. Few minutes from the strip."}
{"text":"OMG...I stumbled in this place one night after First Friday and it is Sooo good. This is my favorite little mexican food joint in Las Vegas. The service is superb and the food just yummy. They have a great little fully stocked bar there as well so get your Margarita ON!!  This place is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Vegas from LA. This is one of 2 Mexican restaurants that has excellent food and service."}
{"text":"We enjoy ourselves every time we come here. I should probably branch out and get some thing other than the fajitas.....but I probably won't. My wife has tried lots of different things and she hasn't had something she wasn't a fan of. If you are looking for good Mexican food....check this place out."}
{"text":"So on my very first night in Vegas, when I'm there for the very first time, I'm at the hotel bar with a co-worker (we were there for a conference) and we're starving...and we ask the bartender for a recommendation.  Something local, affordable, fairly close.

He shoots off a couple of recommendations that all seem a little higher end (we were in shorts and jeans and didn't want to change).  He then thinks for a second and says...\"I know this local Mexican place you might like...\" and that's how we found Casa Don Juan.  When I need a good place to eat...I always ask a bartender - never had a bad meal on a bartender recommendation.

As we left the comfy confines of the casino areas and found our way into a different part of the city I had a feeling I was going to be really happy with this meal (big fan of off the beaten track restaurants).  We got to the place and parked (not a ton of parking, but we were fine) and we were happily greeted by the hostess who seated us immediately and gave us menus.  We also ordered a couple of Tecates and some fresh guacamole which came out a few minutes later with chips, salsa and frijoles.  Usually not a Guac fan, but this was pretty good...we hammered it.  

I ordered the Super Burrito Asada with Chicken and red sauce with rice and beans and my co- worker ordered the Chimichanga with shredded beef and also with a side of beans and rice.  I don't know about you, but when my meal comes out and I know just by looking at it that I'm gonna have a tough time finishing it...I know I'm getting my money's worth.  This burrito was fabulous and was bursting with flavor...and when I walked out of the place I was stuffed...and I was still full in the morning - I skipped breakfast!  My co-worker also loved the chimichanga and said the shredded beef was perfect.

Everything about this place screamed to me that it deserved a second meal...unfortunately, I have NO idea when I will be back in Vegas.  Great service, great food, ice cold beer, and a really great eclectic Mexican décor.  Yeah, I'd recommend this place to anyone who loves Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Incredible huevos con chorizo. The meat is spiced just right and ratio of eggs to meat is perfect. Homemade corn and flour tortillas!!  Excellent rice and beans. The salsa and bean dip served with chips as you sit down are also outstanding. The service is friendly and fast. Great breakfast!!"}
{"text":"If you find yourself Jonesing something somewhat authentic in Vegas, then Casa Don Juan will be your love affair for a Mexican meal."}
{"text":"Food was good here, service was ok. It does get a little busy with staff walking around. I will try it again and see how it goes."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sit down Mexican restaurants I've been to in Vegas! They give you chips with salsa and bean dip - which was delicious. We had the enchiladas and fried chimichanga - both were amazing. The service was great, too. Constantly had my water refilled."}
{"text":"So sorry to say this.  I have been coming here for probably 8 years at least. I feared the food and all good things would vanish when they expanded and opened another restaurant as often happens to small treasured eateries. 
My guy and I went for a late dinner 2/16/17.  Chips, salsa and beans arrived.  Ok I know their salsa is not the best, but tonight it was a watery mess.  Then I tried the beans, they looked weird..like thin yogurt.  YUCK. Tasted like they had been diluted with water and lard. I had two chicken tacos crispy with rice and beans and guy had salad with chicken.  We were so hungry (you know this feeling) that my guy and I ate the food as we b*tched about it.  I even asked for different beans..but then said forget it.  The ones with my dinner were the opposite end of wet...dry paste.  Oh, they started dumping trash/food into two large bins by food window..right out in front of us!  GROSS.  Then proceeded to stack chairs onto the tables..guess it as hint to clear out even tho we were still eating...should have taken as a 'sign' and stopped.
I came home and had to stop thinking of how bad the food was for fear of up-chuck.  Had to take Mylanta before I could sleep. YUCK-  Come on guys- This was my neighborhood gem...my go to place...Once my guy x's a place off that's it.  He said..from now on, if I eat there it will be alone. He did agree to try the new place of theirs..ONCE."}
{"text":"WOW!! WHAT A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE! Service- 5 stars! Food- 5 stars! Atmosphere/cleanliness- 5 stars! We really could not have had a better time here. We were quickly welcomed at the door by the manager, and immediately brought to our table. This place is run like a well-oiled machine. You can tell every employee works together and is busting their ass, without making you feel as if you're being rushed so they can flip a table. I've never seen so many employees smiling. It's as if they enjoyed what they were doing.  What a concept! I'll definitely attribute it to the Mexican culture that prides hardwork while enjoying life attitude. Inspiration for us all. Among the many highlights were our beautiful server Angelica, the incredibly delicious handmade corn and flour tortillas, and the intoxicating salsa.  This is everything you hope for in a sit-down Mexican restaurant. Would love to give more details, but uhh I got a life to live ;-). Will definitely be back soon. Next Saturday sounds good. Angelica here we come!"}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend to this place. I suspected the food must be good when we drove up and there were a lot of cars. Service was great and we were greeted immediately. The food arrived in record time. We actually got our food before our chips, and it would have been nice to have the chips first and relax. Food was yummy and tortillas are homemade. I would come back here on my next trip."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a date night at Casa Don Juan a couple of Saturdays ago. We arrived to a vibrant colorful setting and friendly hostess who sat us in the back by the bar area where the noise level wasn't as busy. We had jumbo margaritas and my husband had a Steak Burrito and I enjoyed the Carne Asada dish. Additionally, the Queso Fundido appetizer was fantastic. I have to recognize the gentleman who brought drinks and bussed our table. He was so attentive and friendly, even when it was super busy. However, the server we had did not surpass anticipations. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our Mexican fare and pleasant surroundings of this dining establisment. I recommend coming here for a fun atmosphere and delicious eats if you're in the downtown area."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican place in the USA-- seriously. Not only is the food amazing, the white cheese dip is some of the best that I've ever tasted, the margaritas are AMAZING. You might think to yourself, hmmmm - lavender margaritas - seriously? And the answer is yes, SERIOUSLY -- you must try it. Try to imagine a warm blanket and a hot cup if tea on a cold winters day, mixed with a little afternoon delight -- and you'll find this margarita which is a mix of comfort and sass -- as well as a delicious explosion in your mouth that l leaves you wanting more. We also tried lime, watermelon, and mango -- all very delicious but you definitely want to begin and end the night with lavender. The food is almost equally amazing -- every fracking bite was delicious and the service was above par. Even my friend who is a super picky eater loved everything that she tasted. If you are in Vegas -- come to this off the strip little slice of heaven -- you won't regret it -- unless you don't try the lavender margarita."}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food in Vegas in my opinion. Not much else to say. Salsa is the best around, although I do wish they fried their chips fresh to order so they are hot, not out from under the heat lamp. We have been in the past where the food wasn't on point, but it's only been once or twice in all the times I've eaten here which I'm sure is at least in the multiple dozens. We've had so many different dishes, kind of hard to review them all - but needless to say I keep coming back and will continue to do so for my mexican food fix!"}
{"text":"I've given this location a few tries and other than a good margarita, I have never had a good meal here. I just keep thinking that if I give them another try it will be better next time. No such luck."}
{"text":"Very cute authentic Mexican restaurant downtown Las Vegas. Stopped in for lunch with my sister after a little shopping on Main street. The hostess was very attentive and helpful. Wait time for a booth was less than 5minutes. The only reason why I am not giving my usual 5 stars, is that we had to ask for beverages, which took way too long, and we than had to ask for a waiter, as no one welcomed us as we had been seated for at least 10minutes. I'm sure they were busy, very understandable on a Saturday afternoon.
Menu is way too long! Too many things to choose from! 
But what we did order was very tasty and delicious. So, it was worth the wait. 
Would I go back? Oh yes, for sure! It was a fabulous lunch with great conversation and food."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite Mexican Restaurants that isn't expensive. Worth driving to downtown Vegas. Love the food. Love the service. Always satisfied. Love their guacamole as well."}
{"text":"Visited there for a biz lunch, the place is old and not upkeep...Sat in a booth and the seat bottom had a 8 inch tear in it....does anyone care? apparently not.
The good: the service was inviting, polite and attentive.
The \"bad\": the food was ok at best, arrived quickly, mainly tasteless...the portions (other then the rice and beans) are fairly small yet the price is not cheap at the least, paid $11 for a 5 inch long enchilada with rice and beans.
the chips were ok, light and crisp, the salsa was hmmm uninspiring at best, the bean dip...about the same.
all in all...there is nothing exiting or inspiring, nothing that make you go WOW, now that is good (insert anything here).
Will I be back? not a chance. there is nothing to come back for,"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican spot in vegas so far. Good prices, portions and great mom and pop environment. Only problem is there's like nowhere to park your car here."}
{"text":"DO NOT BUY THEIR STUPID GROUPON and actually probably don't even bother coming here. No i'm not just another cheap @ss w/ a groupon b*tching about having issues using the discount. They either really don't update their own website, or have ridiculously inflated their prices while this groupon is on - i'm not sure which. 

It was a great deal $10 lunch for 2 and of course there was a $ restriction on the food ($10-11/person), and you pay whatever is over, which is fine. Except that it doesn't mention you can't just order an $8 burrito, you can only order from their comidas y cenas pages (plates w/ beans and rice). Website says $13 for a chimichanga/current menu is $16, website says $10 for chilaquiles/current menu is $20. This isn't effen Border Grill wtf! 

I liked the atmosphere, the food was ok, not much better than Roberto's though. Fast friendly service, but i don't appreciate this bait and switch sh*t. I'd be curious to see if their prices go down once the groupon expires, but irrelevant because i'm never going back to find out."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food! Huge portions, super delicious, and nice to get off the strip of Vegas. 10/10 would recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Bean Dip Bean Dip Bean Dip.... oh how you are so flavorful and taste so good and i cannot stop eating you... that is all i have to say... you gotta have a Pina Colada there! anthing is great especially the 7mares!"}
{"text":"Been to this Mexican restaurant a few times.  Every single time it is excellent.  Plenty of staff to make everything go really smooth.  The food it awesome and the decor is great!  The plates of food are giant too!"}
{"text":"This location was very good and clean. I liked their authentic attire, really sets the mood and scene. The food was really good and came to our table fast. I do like Mexican food, this is a place we will go back to again. We sat down rather quickly and they are quick to come to your table. Staff is very friendly and multiple people bring you chips/salsa, waters, etc. I would like to try the other locations as well but this location was very festive and great to visit and see. Also they have Groupons sometimes also to check out :) Will definitely return here again soon, as there are other foods to try."}
{"text":"My husband and I and two other friends came here on Saturday, March 14th our experience was wasn't great at all. We waited a while for our order to be taken. We asked several times for water we never got. Our drinks ; mango margaritas and other drinks tasted awful like water no liquor whatsoever. Our food wasn't great at all it tasted like you something you buy at the market reheatable meals. Our waiter probably visited our table maybe twice in the two hours that we were there.  We should've just stopped at McDonald's it would've been way much better.  I wish I could give it zero stars but unfortunately Yelp doesn't allow me to."}
{"text":"I usually come here with a group of people and the service tends to be good.

I was in the area and decided to stop by with my wife and get a shrimp cocktail. As soon as we parked and where headed inside we noticed 3 separate bums one laid out in the parking lot one at the corner stop sign and one walking inside the establishment. I don't have anything against homeless people but these people are beyond homeless you can tell the druggies and simply strung out and  just loitering around the business. Not really a good feeling when leaving and parking your car in the \"additional parking\" which is located in the back of the restaurant.

As soon as we walked in we where greeted by a very Hispanic women wearing a.. what a call MARIA DRESS!!! The restaurant itself screams MEXICAN and so does the exceptional food they put out as we walked in to the right we noticed a lovely older lady which could have been one of my grandmothers making fresh tortillas and fresh tortilla chips the smell was awesome. The only down fall is that I noticed that the staff seemed more preoccupied talking amongst themselves then taking care of customers it felt as if we had to let them finish talking to each other before they would notice or talk to us. 

I knew what I wanted to I tried to quickly place my order but was told that I needed to wait for the waiter. The waiter arrived to take the order and my wife had a regular water I ordered a fresh mango water and the shrimp cocktail. The order was made very fast id say it took about a whole 3-4 minutes for the shrimp cocktail to come out as a matter a fact the shrimp cocktail came out before the water which baffled me. I even told the waiter the cocktail came out before the drink?? he quickly replied and said why yes because the mango water has to be freshly made.....so the shrimp cocktail I guess was waiting for me..... The waiter then left and proceeded to a different table. This made me a little upset so I waived him down and asked him kindly to please bring the regular water that is not taken out of the well so that we may have something to at least drink on. The waiter then came back with both the waters.

The shrimp cocktail here is amazing the shrimp are a medium sized shrimp and there are plenty of them WELL THERE BETTER BE AT 15.99 a cocktail. I think that the price is a little high but it is worth it. I have not found another shrimp cocktail to be this tasteful and this rich in flavor and this is the only reason I come here. 

The service was so subpar I refused to leave a tip. When I was paying it seemed like I was bothering the cashier to come check me out after I had already been waiting for 10 minutes at the table for them to come back with my credit card and check. The customer service here is not so great but the food well at least the shrimp cocktail is AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Not the authentic food I was hoping for. Standard Mex-American fare."}
{"text":"Tried out this place because I had a Groupon deal. Food was pretty good, prices were great, and service was excellent! My only complaint would be that the strawberry margarita, which I paid an extra $3 for (upgraded from the on-the-rocks lime margarita that came with the Groupon), was the most bland, watery margarita I've ever had. When I ordered it, the server warned me that the regular margarita was better. I should've listened to him, because boy was he right! I tried the regular margarita as well, and it was good. For some reason, the strawberry one tasted like ice with a hint of bland strawberry flavor. Couldn't taste any tequila at all! But the food was decent (great for the price). I ordered the cheese enchiladas, which is probably my favorite food of all time. They were good. For the price, I'd come back to order them again."}
{"text":"...this place never let us down. Great food, and good people. Especially our waiter Alfredo.

Best Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I went there on a Groupon  a waiter will come up to your table and give you chips and salsa. Then he/she will ask guacamole or cheese?  They don't tell you it's 4.99. Then if you ask for a hotter chili  that's 3.99 extra. Just make sure you are willing to pay for the stuff they sneak up on your table..the tacos are good though. MARGARITAS : DON DRINK THE CHEAP STUFF"}
{"text":"This place was excellent. Can we begin by talking about the Frida Khalo decor? It's so awesome to see such a great artist to be their center of atmosphere. On that note, the music was great. A little surprised they don't have a dance floor for later in the evening. 

Let's talk food. Holy crap. If you eat here, you will not be disappointed. Everything is seasoned to perfection and the portions will definitely fill you right up! This place had authentic delicious Mexican food. Oh, and the margaritas are of the chain, on the rocks or blended.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant found this little restaurant in yelp and had good reviews so decided to give it a try was not disappointed. Everything was great from the server witch was very helpful with menu choices (Ivan) and food was exceptional as well try the chiles toriados they are spicy but are so good"}
{"text":"I had been urged to come here several times by friends, for whom this is their go-to place for a Mexican food fix.  Finally, they simply took me here.  I didn't know what to expect in a remote area of town that was previously unknown to me.  I just ordered my favorites, and let the chips fall where they landed.

In this case an abundance of warm tortilla chips freshly made in house landed on my table in a woven basket, along with hot sauce and a bean dip, just after I had sat down--on a super-hard, wooden seat.  The chips and dipping alternatives were welcome sights for this hungry diner.  Soon two orders of guacamole joined this array, and I quickly forgot about my hard seat.  

The homemade guacamole was cool and creamy, but it still retained a few small lumps and tiny pieces of tomato.  If it contained any sour cream, it was not enough for me to notice.  The hot sauce was good and tasty, with medium-level spiciness.  The bean dip, slightly salty, was mild and addictive.  The chip basket was emptying fast, as one after the other worked their way to my mouth.  Service was excellent, as my water and Sprite were replenished without request, and I was even asked to hand over used paper napkins during the course of dining, so new ones could be immediately supplied.  I don't know if this was the regular level of service or influenced by my photo and note taking inside the restaurant.  But it was stellar service.

I ordered a Burrito Mojado, a wet carnitas burrito covered with Enchilada Sauce and a smattering of guacamole, that I suspected would be too large for me to finish in one sitting.  And I was right--especially because I ordered it with an a la carte Shredded Beef Taco.  The burrito, which was filled with carnitas, beans, and rice, was a bit salty but otherwise tasted great.  The Enchilada Sauce over melted cheese was mild, which is what I prefer.  I ate and enjoyed a little over half of the gigantic burrito that arrived before me, and packaged the remainder for a follow-up lunch.    

The taco in a springy, mostly hard corn tortilla, as ordered, tasted good, but I was quite disappointed that, although it contained adequate amounts of shredded beef, lettuce, and shredded cheese, this taco was sans tomato.  I often pay extra to make sure that I get tomatoes in my tacos, but this time decided that I would just eat what was presented to me as is.  I was surprised that the taco tasted as good as it did while lacking tomatoes, but still would have preferred some cool, red vegetation in that taco.  

Non-Mexican fare did not fare that well on this outing.  Diane's ordered Cheeseburger ran into serious trouble.  In two tries at medium-rare, the kitchen first produced a patty that was beyond well done, and then another that was simply well done.  And the forlorn patties each looked to be no thicker than 1/8 of a pound.

The restaurant had a display case that contained a Chocolate Cake, Red Velvet Cake, Carrot Cake, Cheesecake, and Lemon Cake that all looked pretty good.  So, I ordered a slice of Lemon Cake for sharing.  And, it was cold, imbued with the flavor of lemon, and pretty darn good!

Casa Don Juan has a nice, festive atmosphere with some interesting touches, like several pictures and photos of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo on a dedicated wall.  This is Old Las Vegas, South of the Border style.  And, based on what I ate and experienced here, I intend to return."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican place with great ambiance and friendly efficient service.  Great drinks.  Food was pretty good but not awesome.

First, if popularity is any indicator, this is a great restaurant.  It was packed on Sunday afternoon at 3 PM -- and that's in downtown.

The vibe is typical Mexican.  The waiters' costumes are pretty and authentic.  The service is friendly and efficient -- the waiters hustle.

The margaritas are great.   The guacamole is very good.  However, having such a good feeling about the place overall, I have to say I was a bit disappointed with my food.  The chile relleno was not very flavorful.  The taco was OK at best.  Overall I'd say \"typical smashed bean and rich\" Mexican food -- not worse but not better than the average -- in a much better than average environment.

The menu is huge so hopefully the other dishes impress.  Overall, I like the place and would come back.  (But skip the chile relleno.)"}
{"text":"WOW BIG DIFFERENCE!!!!
Last night Ivan was our server and it was perfect we enjoy our meals and drinks no problem with the specials request ...
We be back"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite authentic Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas. It's easy to get to, but not crowded with tourist traffic. GET THE CARNITAS plate. It's delicious. And they give you a generous serving so there's enough to share. Stiff margaritas, too."}
{"text":"So my buddy and local legend Ernesto Reyes said this is the best Mexican breakfast around so I hit it. He was so right.

So it was easy to find and park. Cool old restaurant and very nicely decorated. I get seated under the shrine for Mary. Awesome service and great food.

Chips, salsa and steaming bowl of frijoles come first. Excellent fresh salsa and great beans. I ordered the chorizo and egg burrito and it was sublime. 

Everything was fresh flavorful and prompt. I'll be back next time I'm in town.

Thanks for the tip Ernie!"}
{"text":"It has become a tradition that every time my girlfriend comes to town, we make a pilagramage to Casa Don Juan. Breakfast, lunch or dinner, makes no difference to us as long as we can get our hands some of  their signature gucamole or nachos or any of their other fine entree's. 

When it comes to a great Mexican restaurant close to the strip, Casa Don Juan has it all."}
{"text":"We use to love coming to this place, it's gotten quite expensive over the years of course just like everything else, but personally I don't even find it reasonable. I spent almost $90 for three people not including their tip. Great people work there, but sadly I don't think I will be returning anytime soon.  I feel like 3.50 for a drink is quite expensive, and they charge for refills-- I also got an $8 slice of cheese cake.  I really feel taken advantage of."}
{"text":"absolutely the pits! margaritas are tasteless and impotent. salsa and bean dip completely horrible. beef burrito pictured for you to see is missing the beef and much more: an absolute  joke. chile relleno breading is mushy and insides still cool from having being nuked. the worst experience imaginable - only reason for this nightmare joint being open is captive audience of local workers. do yourself a big favor and avoid at all costs - it does not get much worse than this: virtually inedible fare at high prices and incompetent management."}
{"text":"If you love Mexican food then this is the place for you! I'm so picky about my food but this place killed it! Bomb salsa & tortilla chips! Amazing customer service, especially if you have Liz as a bartender. She makes the best drinks for you and knows how to indulge with her customers."}
{"text":"Our server, Vain made my dining experience at Casa Don Juan an enjoyable one. He was very attentive to our needs. He coffee cup was refilled without even requesting a refill. Oh, the food was excellent as well. I had the machaca breakfast and it was yummy! The portion was great, and it taste homemade! This is a place I will take my family if we're craving authentic Mexican food flavor! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding! Genuinely welcoming. I had the tamales, one chicken and one pork. Both loaded with meat but a little dry without sauce. Rice and beans tasted like they were just made. Horchata was on point."}
{"text":"My husband and I are super particular about our Mexican food, and other places we've tried in Vegas have left us disappointed with no desire to return. Casa Don Juan, on the other hand, was delicious. The service was good, but the food is where it's at. And let's be honest, we all want good food when we are paying for it. About average prices for a good Mexican restaurant. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely would not recommend to new customers. Meat was rough I didn't eat but one bite asked for meal to be replaced or taken off. Manager said no but he will box up the order for me. He said I'm only one customer out of thousands he would loose."}
{"text":"Great food and large portions. The service is excellent and precise. The only reason I give this restaurant 4 stars is because the prices are quite high, especially for drinks and no specials for locals."}
{"text":"Amazing food brings you back to the real mexican roots. Super friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Our waiter ALEX was awesome, nice Mexican decor & a very clean restaurant. Food was delicious, and the prices are awesome! I did not mind tipping my waiter at all, ALEX deserved it! (Customer satisfied)"}
{"text":"We ate at Casa Don Juan tonight after seeing a show at the 4 queens. The service was not all that good and the food just so so. It came out really fast but did not have much flavor. Probably will not go back again. The raised their prices since we were there a year ago about $4 a plate, and the portions are small. Only about 2 table spoons of beans, give me a break they are the cheapest thing to make, and theirs were watered down. 
They also don't do happy hour on Fridays anymore."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted a cheap, family style Mexican dinner off strip, without breaking the bank. Casa Don Juan delivered it!   If you don't get the carnitas platter, you're crazy!  Tender, succulent braised pork with delicious homemade tortillas, pico, roasted jalapenos, and fresh guac.  Every bite was heaven.  If I lived in Vegas, I'd eat this every week.  The margs were great--healthy mix of fresh juice, mix and tequila.  They went down easy and were reasonably priced.  In Vegas that's under 10 bucks!  

We went back for breakfast.  And I'd give them 4 stars for it.  Potato burrito was tasty and she had potato tacos with eggs.  Taters a little under done.  Would like it spicier next time."}
