{"text":"I used to goto Bluestone Bistro every once in a while... but recently Bluestone Bistro has changed their menu to an a la carte format which means that each and every item is priced individually. The prices have not come down to reflect this change but remain the same as before. Now all the side items must be ordered individually and a simple meal (i.e. burger) is at least 20.00 a person + drinks. Steaks, etc, expect to pay about 40.00.

For a Bistro in Markham the menu is way overpriced. Not only is the food quality not good enough to justify the high price tag but the presentation of the dishes was lackluster.

*** Bread isn't even provided anymore! A large bread roll (which isn't that large) is 7 - 10.00?! Sheesh! ***

I won't be going back. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Good food, has nice ambience and as another reviewer mentioned, it is something nice and different in a neighborhood known for Asian cuisines
 
a tad pricey, so I only go when there is a coupon.

  There is a redflagdeal $20 for $40 of food, expires in nov 2011.

 servers are hit and miss.

The panko onion rings and sweet potato fries are good.
The thin crust pizzas are good.


The brunch is nice, but I find there are places that are more worth it and has a bigger selection of brunch / breakfast items like eggs 4 life on 9th line, south of why 7."}
{"text":"My first (and likely last) experience at the Bluestone. My husband and I went for a late breakfast one Saturday afternoon. We were seated quickly. Our waitress was good, although she entered my husband's order in wrong. Instead of the crab benedict, a regular Benedict arrived. My $6 raspberry and banana smoothie was really good, the size was definitely worth the rather large price tag for a smoothie. My wild mushroom omelette was decent, large portion for $10.99.

All in all, the food was ok, service was good (which makes this place superior to Cora's in my books already), and ambience was good too.  But at the same time, the whole experience was somewhat forgettable. There are many other places to try out, hence the \"first and likely last\" rating."}
{"text":"Like an oasis alternative in a town dominated with Asian restaurants, Bluestone Bistro does not disappoint 

A little hard to find, in a strip mall with an obscure sign next to M&M Meat Shop... this gem was recommended by someone on Yelp Toronto... if I had one night to eat in Markham... what would you recommend? 

Service was stellar, wine list was delightfully robust, and I opted to do share stuff (dinner of 2 things off the share list)... Beef Carpaccio and Portabello Mushroom were were both superb. I felt the need to shamelessly take all leftover bread and sop up the sauce from both of these... lest I cut off the waiter's arm when he tried to take the \"saucy\" plate. My entree: the Goat Cheese poached pear salad... divine. 

The wine list was a little misleading for the illiterate (me)... thought it was 24 for a bottle (turned out that was a 1/2 bottle). My bad (2 bottles later). 

All in all it was a nice meal in a surprising place."}
{"text":"Five stars in Markham?  What's wrong with this world???  I have a very tough time giving five star ratings to seemingly \"regular\" type of places, but this restaurant really really impressed me.

My notes:

1. I ordered a two-course dinner ($25) that came with an app and a main.  App was a simple escargot dish served with a light butter sauce that went amazing with the bread.  The sea bass (or was it basa?) with a nice panko crust.  One of the best pieces of fish I've had anywhere.  Incredible!!!  Worth every penny.

2. Service was friendly, prompt, and attentive without being annoying.

3. Our flatbread was a little bit on the burnt side, but still mostly edible.

4. The place isn't cheap, but has excellent value for the service level and food quality.

5. Only downside is that it's in Markham.

I would seriously do a UYE here, it's that good.  Definitely worth a shot if you live in the area."}
{"text":"I go to Bluestone pretty well EVERYTIME I head to Toronto - My brother has two kids and this place works well for the family.

Despite being a wine bar atmostphere, it's a great place to get consistent, DELICIOUS weekend brunch.  Prices are a little high, but you're paying for quality ingredients and an attentive staff.  I've never had a bad meal here or bad experience for that matter!

Look around and you're almost overwhelmed by the wine bottles in this joint - I've never dined here in the evening so I've skipped their wine selection but their bloody caesars are pretty damn good!

Great place for adult as well as families.  My brother and sis-in-law's big concerns when taking the kids out is cleanliness as well as noise level and this place is wonderful for both!"}
{"text":"I'm having a hard time rating this place as zero stars does not allow you to warn fellow yelpers to stay the hell away....so my poor excuse of giving it one star is because we didn't die of food poisoning and left with everything we came in with less $30 (tax and tip included).  

Food was mediocre at best.  We ordered the Alaska crab benedict and the French toast.  I'll start with my review of the Benedict...first off, was presentable.  Wouldn't say the portions are huge but definitely decent.  Taste was just ok...and the home fries were WAY too salty.  My hubby ordered the French toast.  I guess I didn't hear him say medium rare...but that crap came out like a good juicy steak...bloody and all...too bad it wasn't steak.  It was wet, flimsy and just plain old unappetizing looking and tasting.

As for the service...the staff I think comes as dumb as they come.  Firstly, this appears to be a family restaurant.  We have a little one that grabs everything.  They put us onto a two man table and stuck baby on the side.  The waitress put the hot coffee in front of him even though she saw him grabbing at everything...we had to ask to move to a bigger table...WTF?  Secondly, when my Alaska crab Benedict arrived, I had to ask for the English muffin that comes with it...the waitress was like \" oh yeah...you want the English muffin?\".  Obviously dumb ass...it's a egg bendict...however I replied with just a \"yes\" :). 

Anyhow...all in all...I'm glad I went.  At least I can now tell ppl to get their asses over to T&T bakery on main street where service and food are good and have staff that is pretty easy on the eyes ;).  

Thanks Bluestone Bistro for my first and absolutely last visit."}
{"text":"For a while, I'd been hunting for an alternative to Cora's by Warden and Highway 7. Our last visit was a disappointing, simply due to the fact that Cora's popularly has caused the quality of the food and service to plummet over the last year.

Therefore it was a nice change when a friend took me here for Sunday brunch. It was surprisingly quiet but in reality, this restaurant has a spacious interior, partitioned well enough that you feel as if you're sitting in a private room if your tables are seated far apart from one another. 

Their omelet selection includes vegetarian, three mushrooms and goat cheese, four-cheese and even seafood.  I ended up having eggs florentine, dripping with hollandaise and pan-fried rosti with wilted spinach ($12.99); pleasant and not overly greasy or heavy.  It normally comes with salmon, but being the vegetarian, I asked if I could have fruit instead and I received a bowl of heaping propotions!  I'd excepted additional charges for my request, but was surprised when there were none on the bill.

Make sure, if you can, to have Cliff as your waiter. Very polite, on the ball, wonderful service and deserving of a good tip! As well, he didn't make a fuss when I asked if I could finish my Starbucks latte in the restaurant.

I hope to come back and try a few of the vegetarian dishes that they have. I've briefly browsed the menu online and it seems that their menu is mostly focused around Mediterranean, Greek and Italian dishes, such as olives, bruschetta, goat cheese, seafood, etc."}
{"text":"this restaurant is ok.  It's definately nice inside and has a big menu.  Pretty expensive actually. 

I've gone here for work functions too and it's been great for that.  They have really cool private rooms if you need them.

Good breakfast too."}
{"text":"This review is based on my brunch experience The Bluestone Bistro.

I am really impressed with the quality of the food at the Bluestone Bistro for Brunch. We ordered the Alaskan Crab Egg Benedict ($13.99) and Italian Omelettes ($8.99) to share. Both of them tasted really good! The Omelettes were nicely made and really fluffy! And the portion is big! We were both stuffed full with all the food.

I would recommended making a reservation if you have a big group. Since there were at least 3 groups of over 10 people having brunch there when I arrived. (I made my reservation at www.opentable.com the night before!)

When it is patio weather, there are some seatings outside too. However you will be looking at the parking lot!"}
{"text":"Visited this place last week with a few friends.  Found the food to be quite overrated and the atmosphere to be a little on the pretentious side.  Expensive food does not always get you good food."}
