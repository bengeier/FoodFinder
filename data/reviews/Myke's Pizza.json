{"text":"What else can I say but.....DAMN! THAT WAS SUCH GOOD PIZZA! Can't believe I almost passed it up and went to a chain. Myke patiently made us the potato & bacon pizza plus the cheese and arugala pizza. And so.....minutes later, we devoured them. *only open Friday & Saturday. Whhhhhaaaaa!
P.S: this gem is hidden in front patio of Mezona Market."}
{"text":"Freakin' delicious pizza! Wish they had a store front or were open more days. Get there early as some days they run out of dough before the nights over but man oh man, it's good. Their pepperoni are little and have a kick. Love having a cool pizza joint close by."}
{"text":"Yum!   We went for for first time tonight and it as amazing!   The potato and salami pizza were out of this world delicious.   You can tell they use fresh quality ingredients."}

Bacon and potatoes go together like peanut butter and jelly!

Myke's Pizza was at Cider Corps for St. Paddy's Day and what a treat! We got a Potato & Bacon 12\" pizza for $12 to share. It had garlic cream, mozzarella, potatoes, bacon, rosemary and aged Gouda. Might I say... BOMB! The crust was thin and it was very foldable. There wasn't too much cheese drag but the toppings worked very well together. I like the use of rosemary as it helped elevate the overall flavor. It was a darn good pizza that I've been wanting a try since my homie Amber R. sent me a picture.  And we definitely ate the whole dang pizza too!

I was super excited to see their set up at this great cidery. I would definitely go back to Myke's. Here's hoping they get a brick & mortar storefront soon!"}
