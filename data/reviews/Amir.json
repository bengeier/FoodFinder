Food is made in house and there's always lots of seating. Free cold water if you're thirsty. Though the decor is dated."}

{"text":"Went to Amir and the service was horrible the staff is incompetent the food wasn't that great and they give you attitude of the girl at the cash and it's like if you're doing them a favour for coming to this location."}
{"text":"I walked in at around 12:00 pm on a Friday. There were three employees behind the counter, including the cashier who was ringing up an order. Other than the person paying, there was no one in line.

The remaining two employees were a woman mixing potatoes with seasoning and a man speaking with her.

Upon entering and lining up, I was not greeted. The potato mixer looked up, saw me and looked back down. The man speaking to her (about potatoes, perhaps) looked in my general direction and turned back toward her. They continued their conversation, without acknowledging me. 

This continued for roughly two minutes. At this point, I said (out loud) \"OK\" and proceeded to walk away. No one made any attempt to turn me back.

I have worked with the public and understand that prep work is an essential part of running a restaurant. However, prioritizing it over a waiting customer, without so much as a greeting, is a surefire way to lose customers.

I'll never trouble them again."}
{"text":"I have been going to different Amir restaurants and getting the same plate which is a Combo plate no rice no potatoes. Instead I replace with 2 salads. Never have I been charged extra. 

For the past year I have been going to this Amir restaurant located on Notre Dame because it's close to my work place and have been ordering the same dish. Today I was astonished that they wanted to charge me 1$ extra for the same plate that I ordered last week. 
He said it was always like this...and I told him that he was wrong. He seemed to be the owner or the owner's son. He was extremely rude and tried to rob me of a 1$ for absolutely no reason. Its not a question of 1$, it's a question of principle.

He made the biggest mistake as a small business owner. Just because you own a restaurant doesn't give you the right to change prices at random as you please! 

I am appalled by the way he spoke to me and disrespected me. His staff was staring at him because they knew he was making a fool out of himself. 

I will never ever go back to that restaurant and I will make sure no one I know goes as well. 

Customer service is very much lacking in the place."}
{"text":"The last time I went to this place the guy serving my food was so sweaty it was disgusting. I literally watched sweat beads drip off his forehead into the salad he was making me.  Walked right out and never went back."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service with even worse food. Went there and ordered the chicken platter. The chicken was half cooked, still bloody and smelled of raw chicken. 
When I asked for another plate for this one would send me to the hospital, the owner told me that I would have to pay again for he had already served me once !!!
When he told saw me take out my phone...his actual words were \"post your review, I do not give a $h1t. Nobody reads that garbage anyway \"

Welcome to the 21st century :)"}

{"text":"Excellent Shish taouk (poulet). Salades de bonne qualité. Excellent rapport Qualité-prix pour ce resto."}
{"text":"I live nearby and everytime I go get some takeout from this place I end up not feeling so well. I had friends that were also sick after getting a bite there. They don't use knifes at this specific location to cut the chicken, instead they use an electric trimmer and from my experiences they must not clean it very often. Tasteless food..."}

{"text":"Jacques-Cartier Place is to Montreal what Pier 39 is to my San Francisco...a tourist trap. Nevertheless, it's very scenic and my wife and I were on our first trip to Montreal, so we stopped in our last day at Amir, lured by the \"2 for 1\" drink offer on a sign out front. We didn't eat anything (my wife at crepes next door) but just wanted the two beers for the listed $6.75. The server came with one beer, about 20 oz., and said, \"See, two for one.\" Even my wife, who doesn't drink, knew what a rip that was. THEN, when the bill came, it said $11.89 or so. I called the manager over. I said, sure, I was an American tourist, but $11.89 for one 20-oz beer was ridiculous. The manager called the waiter over who said, \"Oh, sorry, my mistake.\" Yeah. This is a tourist trap. Avoid."}
{"text":"Amir is always good but this location is better because the service is always fast and the staff is super friendly. 

I always order kafta and it is always cooked to perfection. It can get dry real quick so I am glad they take the time to keep an eye on the cook while serving other customers.

Wish they would make a coleslaw so you don't always have to take the green salad soaked in dressing"}
{"text":"This is now called Resto 419, but it's still the same old dump. The red flag was when I ordered Merlot off the menu. About 10 minutes later, the waiter returned to ask if Merlot was red or white wine! The wine we got was very bad red table wine, at $17 a glass! The waiter was trying really hard, but needed some training. He asked if we wanted our drinks now or later after we ordered them, and when he brought my wife her entree, he asked to have it back so he could show it to someone at another table! The food was actually OK -- standard pub fare. I got Poutine. The potato wedges were too big, but otherwise it was fine. My wife got grilled salmon over a salad. The salmon was good, but the salad was swimming in dressing. The food wasn't great, but not bad considering everything else. It's really quite shocking that a restaurant this bad can continue to operate in such a prime location."}
{"text":"Ordered from here only once, thought the food would be as good as the one located in Lachine, I was wrong. The garlic sauce tasted like miracle whip was so gros. Service needs major improving. Sticking with the one near me from now on."}

Ordered shish taouk and kebab
We were four but ordered two plates with extra sticks for either dish
Fairly fast to prepare
Tasty and delicious 
The beer was expensive, however, it is not a beery environment 
The staff were nice and helpful too
Had a good one"}
{"text":"All Amir restaurants are not created equal. This one distinguishes itself for it's meguez and armenian sausage sandwiches. The shish taouk pita or platter is a good bet but my opinion is divided when it comes to their shawarma - too much meat tenderizing? This said, the crew behind the counter and owner is always very friendly and it's a good spot to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"This is officially the worst Amir in the province.
Food: not fresh
Service: not friendly and clearly doesn't want to be here either.
Quality: 0/10 falafel , garlic sauce made me and my wife throw up.

Just don't come here"}
{"text":"We lucked out in Lachine with this ownership group running this restaurant because not only is the food as you would expect which is very good, the ambience, the warmth, the friendliness, and the courtesy is unmatched. It's very rare that you can walk into a fast food restaurant and feel like you're in a high-end restaurant with specialty care. But this is what they do. Definitely a go to place when you are hungry and you need something that's real good in Lachine."}
{"text":".... Je cherche encore le goût de l'ail dans la sauce à l'ail... 
3 plats différents, 3 personnes différentes et la même déception, aucun des plats n'avait ce goût  délicieux de la cuisine Libanaise...

{"text":"Went to lunch Sunday: asked for combo plate.   I was not asked about any preferences.   Got a huge rice plate,  a salad drenched in dressing, garlic sauce aver the pickles and burned shawarma meat. 
I picked at the meat.  Found a few pieces of potatoes and threw out the rest. 
Horrible service and experience."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Food took a long time to come. Good was not worth the wait and quality was terrible. You can probably find much nicer places for similar pricing. Waiters seemed inexperienced and all over the place. The chefs omelette was supposed to come with a side of fruit. The side of fruit came with two pieces and that's all. Definitely won't come here again."}
{"text":"This place almost makes me feel like cooking.

The woman at the counter is truly insufferable,  everyone at work knows her. (tattoos, jewelry and makeup mixed with arrogance and unkind customer service) 

The food itself is not that bad, maybe $1 more per plate than Adonis,  but definitely better.

Just know you can change the stock leafy salad for other options, like bean salad.

This place is super busy at lunch and they don't accept credit cards. They deliver in this sector as well, but it can then get pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Its in the middle of the Old Montreal tourist trap, but when you need something to eat it works. Among the restaurants on Place Jacques-Cartier, Amir had the only dishes that were cheap and they had a decent patio. We had two sangrias & linguine poulets. The food was good, but it was kind of confusing since we thought we were ordering the special (linguine primavera). Oh well.

But they do get stars off for the constant waiting. The food took a while and wrapping up leftovers/getting the check took forever!!!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken and schwarma combo plate and I really liked the food. reminds me of the kabob places in DC. huge portions and the toum was sooo good, you can pretty much pour it over your plate. I will def go back when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch before catching the bus. We ordered the assiette pita ($11) and couscous veggie ($9) plates. Both were delicious and flavorful, especially the couscous veggie plate. In fact I was surprised how much and different the veggies are from other restaurants. Good portion for a good price!"}
{"text":"Went here today to grab a quick chicken plate before going to work. (I work in the restaurant industry) and I live in the neighbourhood but had to go out of my way to return because the chicken was undercooked!!! When I originally walked in, I didn't receive a very friendly welcome, barely a hello, (it's always like that at this Amir) but I still left 15% because I know it's a tough business. when I returned to bring the undercooked chicken they didn't even apologize and made me feel like it was my fault, I still remained polite and said thank you for replacing the dish but they couldn't even say sorry for the inconvenience or have a nice day or anything. I looked at the man and said \"you can't even apologize\" and he walked away.... I don't know who the owner is but that's not the way to keep your customers! If I was that rude to a customer at my restaurant I'd lose my job! 0 customer service!! I get that you're just a counter but if you want repeat clients, especially those who live or work in the area you might want to make an effort! 
You won't be getting my business ever again...
Have a nice day!!

{"text":"Dependable little shish taouk place in my neighbourhood.    
We go every couple of weeks for some pitas to bring home - always fresh, chicken is always well cooked but not dry.
Staff is polite, restaurant is huge if you want to eat there."}

{"text":"Amir est mon fast-food préféré je dois avouer. Prendre un assiette de shish taouk chez Amir c'est  presque comme le trio Big Mac, tu te tannes jamais d'en manger. Par contre, contrairement au trio Big Mac, une assiette de shish taouk te remplit pour beaucoup d'heures.

Il faut par contre faire attention avec la sauce à l'ail, ça donne une haleine quelque peu spécial.

Ça et après avoir été veillé, c'est parfait."}
{"text":"Not your typical Amir. Beautiful interior with a cafe. Large wooden tables and decorated nicely with a large window bringing in the natural light. Food is excellent. Always fresh, always delicious. Love their choices of salads. Never disappointed. The cafe is a bonus!"}
{"text":"I'd never been to an Amir, didn't realize it was a chain.  The servers were really confused (I'm hoping it was because they hadn't used the patio in a while).  It too FOREVER for the food to come.  The only plus - the potatoes, they were yummy (and I don't even like potatoes).  Go for the patio, not for the service.  One guy near us got smart, and went through the take out section and served himself.  He got his food faster and saved on the tip!"}
{"text":"There are many Amir restaurants in the Montreal and Laval region with some being clearly better than others. Amir regulars can concur.

Sadly, the closest Amir to my house constantly fails to deliver the goods.

Service in store is slow, sometimes to point of being LAZY. 

Delivery is a disaster. They can't seem to understand you correctly on the phone and constantly screw-up orders. 

You state, no turnips in your sandwich.

Guess what, you get turnips, sometimes even EXTRA turnips.

Awesome!

No salad please, just fries.

Guess what?

Salad.

....without dressing.

Seriously?

We spend more time while picking them out from our sandwiches if they are doing this on purpose to enrage us or simply suck so bad at taking orders instead of fully enjoying our meal and regretting simply not driving to another Amir.

The shish-taouk however is out of this world however.

The price tag is slightly more expensive than most fast food joints in this area.

Conclusion? It's a risk ordering on the phone, an in-store visit is recommended.

If you really want this food and don't mind driving a few kilometers, head to the one near Carrefour Laval, its a far better experience and one of the best Amirs in Montreal / Laval.

Sadly, they don't deliver to my house. :("}
{"text":"Très bon restaurent et ils sont généreux dans les portions ! Mais ne prend pas les promotions affichées sur le site internet Amir."}
{"text":"Ordered a Filet mignon and lobster tail.  Asked for medium-rare, got medium...lucky meat was still tender to eat.  The tail was not a fresh lobster tail, probably frozen tail...not that good."}
{"text":"Montreal has lots of restaurants that carry the Amir name, but they're not all equal in quality. Most are fine, but few are as good as the branch on St John's and Labrosse.
 The selection is unusually wide, the presentation of dishes is attractive and the quality is quite good. 
Bonus: the service is pleasant, portions generous, decor is stylish and the whole place seems just to have been scrubbed clean. This is about as good as fast food gets."}
{"text":"At least my boyfriend likes his shish kebab plate, despite not being given some of the veggies or pita it's supposed to come with. My chicken pita trio was sad. My pita had no flavor in it what's so ever, not to mention fell apart soggy from the water off the lettuce, it wasn't even closed at the bottom. I asked for half potatoes and half salad (they had 6 salad choices that looked decent) and was handed flavorless/textureless potatoes and a \"salad\" of the plain julienned lettuce they use for wraps, and when I say plain I mean with zero on it, not even a sauce/dressing. Seriously? I ordered from this place once off Just Eat and thought the awful order was a fluke, I was proved wrong."}
{"text":"Spotty service, plenty of patio space - and over 2 for 1 happy hour scam 2 glasses of beer was 13.08. Complete tourist trap. Should have known better."}
{"text":"Honestly I am a HUGE fan of Amir.. depends which one you go to of course but this one in Lachine wasn's bad at all. My favorite Amir so far (hands down) is the one in Mount Royal. Their chicken platter is amazing and they ALWAYS fill the plates. I have enough food to last me for 3 days!! Mmmmmm... Amir...."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and i'm addicted to falafel.
Sometimes I need a falafel so bad that I get the shakes; yeah it's that bad.

Amir always has falafel and it's consistently the worst in town.  

The problem is that these buggers are often open when all the other falafel places are closed. That's why they get 2 stars, just for being open.

You can always count on the fact that the falafel balls are premade and already fried so there's no freshness.  Then when you get there they nuke it the falafel balls.  
Major faux pas. I've been reluctantly going there for years at various locations and not once have i ever had a fresh falafel sandwich. At best the falafel sandwich gets a 3/10.  

But because they are open..they sometimes get my falafel money which makes me sad because they seriously don't deserve it."}
{"text":"One of the most beautiful Amir I ever visited. It looks like a chic urban café you find at le Plateau. Great ambiance and the staff is wonderful. Overall wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm kind of shocked by the poor or mediocre reviews here. Honestly, my chicken and beef shawarma combo plate was one of my favorite meals from my recent Montreal trip, which might sound surprising but I REALLY love shawarma, and the entire plate, from the shawarma to the rice to the potatoes to the toum (garlic sauce), etc were all spot on in my opinion. 

In fact, when I ate this meal I remember thinking to myself how much I wish there was a Restaurant Amir near where I live so I could eat it more often. 

If you enjoy Lebanese and Middle Eastern food, Amir is a great spot with quick service and very decent prices. I would return in a heart-beat."}
{"text":"Pretty pub like which is sad as it is very central old montreal on the restaurant strip and appears like it could be a great placd to eat.

Sangria didnt really have a ton of liqour
Mushroom soup didnt have much mushroom
Burger was made out of something different i know my burgers and the meat almost taste like it had a ton of breadcrumbs in it as filler.

Outdoor patio chairs are rocky

Service was 4/5
English speaking servers which is great !"}
{"text":"Amir is now a very used franchise and the experience you'll get from one to the next is very different at times. At this particular franchise the shish taouk plate I ordered was bland, the garlic sauce was practically tasteless and the rice was barely warm when I was served. The service was quick and efficient but mostly because there's no line-ups, barely a few patrons here during lunch time and that in itself should have been a clue by itself.

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Dimanche après midi, peu de clients.  

Assiette de Shish Taouk au poulet:

Sauce a l'ail?  ne goûte pas du tout comme les autres rest. Amir ou j'ai mangé.  Je n'ai pas apprécié.

Poulet peu de goût. Patates ok

J'avais très faim, alors j'ai quand même apprécié.

La personne avec qui j'étai a semblé l'avoir apprécié plus que moi."}
{"text":"This is your typical Lebanese place that specializes in Shish Taouk, Shwarma among others.  It has a good number of tables for eating there with a outdoor patio for the warmer months.  Service is fast and to the point, exactly what you want at a fast food joint.  If you go for lunch expect a crowd."}
{"text":"abusolutely disgusting. Blend and gross. Whoever took my order and does not know how to lower her voice."}
{"text":"This is one of my best restaurant in Montreal. Taste really good. They always serve fresh beef and chicken!"}
{"text":"We did not know that this was Amir. There was no name on the outside. We only found out through Yelp, so maybe they lost the franchise rights.

We were greeted by a nice lady at the entrance offering us free appetizer (soup or salad) and dessert with the purchase of the entrees. 
Since every other restaurant on the strip was packed, and we had a group of 14, it seemed like a a good deal. They had a cool mist coming from under the patio canopy which created a nice visual effect, and gave a nice perception of cooling on a hot Montreal day, but it made the tables sticky and dank. The tables on the patio were worn and mismatched giving the impression that the patio was an afterthought. The tables were filthy, and the hostess brought us napkins to open and place on the tables. Why not have place mats then?

The food: Artichoke salad was a huge bowl of cut artichokes with a dressing. That is, open the can, pour artichokes into a bowl, toss with dressing and serve. My guests could not eat it all.  The Fish for the fish and chips were the deep fried cheap stuff. The middle-eastern specialties which I have ordered in other places were chicken kebabs (mine) and beef Kabobs, (no lamb, huh?) served with what might have been McCain's Seasoned hashbrown potatoes; little diced potato cubes with a seasoning coating, deep fried. We had to asked for Naan, or pita which I usually get in other places.

The beverages: Typically an operation's gold-mine. We were hosting our family from abroad, so we were a social group. aka, keep offering us drinks, and you will make a mint! We ordered drinks, and well, the food came before the drinks. She did bring us a (singular) pitcher of water to share with the table ( 60 oz divided by 14 people= 4.28 oz per person) and plastic glasses. 40 minutes in, we had our food, I offered to make the drinks for them, but was assured that they had it under control. No refills were offered. Did I mention that it was a hot day, and we had a social group?

The Service: I can only describe it this way. This is a fast-food concept trying to be full service. It doesn't work. There is no service standard. The staff has not been trained to be waitstaff, and have no sense of urgency, or focus towards guest satisfaction. They do apologize lots though. It feels like they are in business to make money, not make their guests happy. Which, being in a tourist trap probably works, but is such a waste of opportunity. BTW, we came back to Old Montreal the next day, and avoided the place like the plague (lost opportunity?). We went next door instead (Wow)

The place lacks love. The menu is pedestrian, and is printed as cheaply as possible. There is no brand identity, nor really a concept (outside of being fast food, trying to be full service). The place is filthy and disorganized; tables on the inside not setup properly, kegs and debris against the wall beside the bar. Bathrooms were dirty. I told the owner he can get toilet paper dispensers from his supplier for free, instead of having a broken, non-functioning one on the wall.

The staff were nice and tried their best. It is sad to see such a beautiful location not maximize their potential. And, they do nothing to support the tourist trade and the wow factor that is Old Montreal. Thank goodness we went to the restaurant next door on our following visit, or my guests would have said that they \"went to Old Montreal, which was great, but the food sucked!\"."}

{"text":"You know if I write a review shortly after eating at a place it's more than likely it's going to be a bad one. 

Here are the fundamental flaws with this place:

1. The plates are pre-staged with the salad and are in plain view of the customer. Both uncovered and in refrigerated. God knows how long try have been sitting on that rack. On my visit it was sitting there long enough for the salad to wilt and turn brown leaving it inedible.
2. Service. The attendant put her hands in her pocket several time, wiped her face and even used her mobile while serving. Not once did I see hands being washed after touching her persons! 

3. Food quality. I am not a good snob but pulling flat bread out of a package and dumping it on a plate is just lame and uninspiring. At least heat it up or put the package out of plain view of the customers. 
The kebabs were tough, flavorless and just plain too small for the price point. 

Ending things on a good note, the shwarma which was very  good and tasty. It's the only thing that saved this place from being a 1* review."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Paid $6 for a chicken pita which was just lettuce and garlic sauce, could barely find any chicken in there. Not the typical Amir!"}
