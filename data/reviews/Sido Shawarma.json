{"text":"Overpriced. Lacking in flavour, dry and cold, none of which are good descriptions for a falafel, but all are accurate in this case. I assume they make their money on people who are here for the airport, who buy food once and never return.   The samosa was ok. Just ok. The falafel was so bad that this hungry guy only ate half. I could not stomach the rest."}
{"text":"Finally this place has a name. The best shawarma downtown that I'm aware of. Get the chicken shawarma plate."}
{"text":"Great food, location and service.  The owner is always there and takes great pride in his food.  No matter what hotel we choose near Pearson airport, we get Sido Shawarma!  Great food, great price.  The owner cooks and serves with love and care."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch. Nothing fancy, but clean, reasonably priced and great food."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place . as I go to The Keg right across the street ! I got the chicken shawerma plate and 4 falafel ! really friendly older man served me! the food was really good, and the falafel 4/2.99 was really tasty ! I will definately be returning!"}
{"text":"Tried the chicken plate previously as was not as satisfied as I am today. A different employee served me and did not skimp out on anything! I will be returning if he is working!"}
{"text":"Solid schwarma with friendly service. I've only had the chicken wrap, but after about 25 of them I can say they are delicious and consistent. Chicken is rich and flavourful and they don't skimp on toppings. At $7 this is a fantastic deal and a great meal."}
{"text":"Overpriced for quality. Their food is nothing special and man are they expensive. I paid almost 12 dollars for some rice and butter chicken,  and honestly when I paid the money I was expecting quality. My mom makes butter chicken better at home. The quantity they gave is probably 3 dollars worth.  I think they charge way too much because they are close to the airport location and there are no other shawarma places nearby. I would suggest when cravings take over, swing a couple lights North on airport road to zets."}
{"text":"This place is decent, though the signs out front are a bit misleading. The Subway next door to this place IS open 24 hours. Sido Shawarma is not, despite the layout of the sign.  Their butter chicken is good. Their falafel is also good. I question the freshness of the vegetables they serve with both, and I'm a bit sad that none of their food is made to order (their falafel just sort of sits out on the counter).  The staff were extremely friendly. The flavor in the food was pretty good. It just seems to be the questionable freshness of everything that makes this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"I have had the Chicken Shawarma Plate seven times in the past month and each time it has been the perfect plate of food. Everything about it works, from the fresh layers of vegetables to the rice and surprising roasted potatoes before they put on the excellent chicken and two sauces. This is what the other shawarma places should be imitating--fresh ingredients that work together. I will try the beef one day, but it wasn't ready when I was in this morning."}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken shawarma wrap - would come here every week if I lived closer.  Chicken was tender and the toppings were plentiful."}
{"text":"Thought I'd get a shawarma around my workplace. Terrible, the portions were so small for a plate with little meat. The price was almost $12 and I had food poisoning the next day. The cashier was nice though."}
{"text":"This place is closed and became authentic taste of indian cuisine Link: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/authentic-taste-of-indian-cuisine-toronto"}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite places when overnighting in YYZ. This place is one of the favorites with the airline crews who stay in the local hotels. And if anyone knows a deal, it's these people.  Those lamb shanks are No One one my list things to have here."}
{"text":"Stopped here post landing 9 hour flight.neat clean place with a lot of really good fresh cooked hot meals other than the usual shawarma.lamb shank, an unexpected surprise. Worth the $12.....I'd feel better if it was 9."}
{"text":"Consistently great food. I always get the shawarma and a side of falafel. The owner is very friendly and I stop here every time I have an overnight in Toronto. It's a little expensive, but definitely very tasty food.   If you want beef shawarma they only serve it until 2"}
{"text":"Drove to Toronto for a family vacation, heard this city is known for its great shawarma places - thought i try Sido that was nestled in a busy part of the city...the atmosphere is friendly and clean with a modern look, very nice customer service they treat u like family....great idea that they put up is a blackboard that people can use to write quick restaurant review  Food is simply amazing, very affordable...its a mix of indian and middle eastern, making a delicious fusion.  Food portions are large, perfect on the go for workers out for lunch around the area.  Highly recommend the butter chicken, trust me you wont be disappointed...the chicken shawarma is also to die for"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times - almost daily when I'm in town. This is a solid shawarma joint with large portions and decent prices. Typically, I order either the chicken shawarma plate or the chicken shawarma wrap. Both are good, and the wrap is huge! One thing I really like about Sido Shawarma that you don't always see in similar restaurants are the varied choices of vegetables and toppings for your wrap or plate. The staff is also super friendly and you're likely to see the same people working on every visit."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma was good. Salad was a little soggy but overall not bad for the price. Go easy on the hot sauce, it's very hot!! I'll definitely be back if I am in the area. Friendly service as well."}
{"text":"My family gave this place a try. They were very friendly and helpful. We all had the Shawarma and found it to be very, very dry.  I would not go back. Too bad because of the good, friendly service."}
{"text":"This is a small, clean, tasty Mediterranean food grill. It's not a fancy restaurant. It does not have a large Menu. But what it has, it does very well.  I had the chicken Gyro platter, and they convinced me to try one of their lamb shanks as a side item.  The chicken was nicely flavored and tasty. The salad and rice were nice accompaniments. But the lamb shank deserves a paragraph on it's own.  I occasionally order osso bucco in fine restaurants. When I do, I'm used to paying $30 for it.  This lamb shank in sauce was easily the best lamb shank I have ever had. Perfectly cooked, wonderful flavor, not to be missed."}
{"text":"We went here a couple of weeks ago to pick up lunch because Subway was too busy. I'm a huge fan of shawarmas but I didn't get my hopes up because it reminded me of a less clean Ali Baba. I ordered the beef shawarma (wrap) and they just gave me whole wheat pita because I guess they ran out of white pita. None of the condiments looked appealing so I just asked for turnip and onions (which they put a million on), hot sauce and garlic sauce. It was one of those shawarmas that, if you put it down, it would break apart. The meat was tough, had fatty pieces and was very salty. It was extremely hard to eat because it was wrapped so loosely. I didn't enjoy it so I only ate about half. If desperate, I might go back and have a falafel instead.  I also wanted to mention that the parking in the rear of the building it a NIGHTMARE. You have to have so much patience and be a master in reverse and parallel parking to maneuver around that small space."}
{"text":"I used to work in the area and miss this place. I drove from North Brampton. Fantastic as always and the staff is amazing. Always guaranteed two key components when restaurant searching. This is the spot...."}
{"text":"Sido Shawarma is just around the corner from my office so it's a usual suggestion when people want to go out for lunch. As someone who is used to Israeli-style (MeVaMe, Sofra, Hannah's, Meron) shawarma, Sido's stuff doesn't quite compare. For one, the chicken shawarma is rather bland and quite dry. The toppings are also very bland and the person making the sandwiches is always rushing so you don't get much. By the time you ask for more they're on the next sandwich. Upon visiting today I notice they increased all their prices by about $0.50 to $1. A basic chicken shawarma is now $6.19 plus tax. Their plates are close to $9 plus tax. Value-wise it's just not worth it considering the sandwiches are bland and the service is so rush-rush-rush.   They also do lamb shanks, beef kabobs, falafel, and some kind of variation on butter chicken. These items are all quite expensive and again, the value just isn't there considering the portion size you receive. They are Halal which is a bonus if you observe that dietary requirement.  BTW: As previously mentioned, the parking lot in the back is very tight. Getting in/out is difficult as the narrow driveway can only accommodate one car entering or exiting at a time."}
{"text":"Needed a quick in and out for dinner before an evening church service, after several attempts at nearby ultra busy restaurants I spied this place. Ordered a lentil soup and a falafel plate with salad and rice. The soup was outstanding wonderfully spiced, a real treat. The falafels were in the process of being prepped in the kitchen you could here the food processor whirring; within minutes they were ready for the fryer. Without a shadow of a doubt these were the best I have had anywhere, perfectly fried, full of flavor, moist flavorful interior and crunching exterior. The salad was excellent as was the rice. This place is a hidden gem on the outskirts of Toronto for sure worthy of a stop!"}
{"text":"Lunch lines can get long but don't let the lines deceive you!! The food is subpar and far from the best shawarma I've had. We went a little past 12pm and the beef on the spit was almost done - there was plenty of the chicken left. The chicken definitely looked more appetizing but I assumed that the beef was amazing, which is why it was gone so fast. Left with a beef shawarma plate which smelled amazing. I had high hopes but unfortunately I found it to be dry and bland. They are also not very generous with the amount of beef they give you. My go-to place (sadly not in the city) does it way better and this place doesn't come close."}
{"text":"Nothing special really. Basically subway does shawarma. The food is ok and comes in good quantities. The prices are pretty high and the place has no charm.  BUT in this pseudo industrial location that resembles purgatory choices are few. Thus a 2.5 elevates to a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken shawarma plate; currently eating it at the moment. I felt compelled to log on as quick as I could to write a review on my experience. The staff were extremely friendly & moved the line along quickly without being rude about it. Although i was expecting a typical rice & chicken dish with the signature sauce; i got so much more than I expected; and thats not a bad thing. The meal comes with a fresh salad, fresh rice & great sides (chick peas & pickled beet slices) all combined on one plate. I am normally an extra sauce on everything kind of girl but this dish does not need it. The combination of flavours keep your palette wanting more! Without hesitation, I will go back."}
