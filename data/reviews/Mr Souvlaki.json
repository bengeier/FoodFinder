{"text":"This place is GROSS. I had the chicken leg meal, it was the worst thing I've ever had, and that's pretty fail proof. The tomatoes in the salad had gone off, the salad dressing was watered down to oblivion, the rice literally tasted like nothing, the chicken was so hard I couldn't even slice it, I did not find any feta in there, and the tzatziki was barely there."}
{"text":"Their vegetarian dinner is very good considering the portion and the price, big and cheap, plus the view from the patio indoors is brilliant. Their falafels are pretty good but a tad dry since they sit under a heat lamp all day, otherwise good and tasty."}
{"text":"This place is usually less crowded than the other vendors in the small food court, but they produce your standard greek food court fare with consistent quality. One thing to note about this place is that they sell cans of Cherry Coke for $1. That earns them an extra star in my book."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for over 10 years, and was here yesterday. I will continue going here as it never disappoints. Good prices compared to other Greek/Mediterranean places, and have portions that are very filling. Only wish they'd be a little more generous with the meat portions and the tatziki  sauce, but who wouldn't want more of that. Overall, this is my favourite food place to ever exist and I will always eat here."}
{"text":"$6.50 all in gets you a small pork souvlaki plate and it is not small at all. The lineup can be confusing to navigate because it is the longest one in the whole food court. This, however, speaks to the awesomeness of this place. If you don't want to wait, show up at 1145 to beat the lunchtime crowd. These people are friendly and fast. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I like that I can get a chicken skewer for 3$. 

The taziki sauce in this town is basically watered down spicy ranch...I've never experienced taziki sauce without a hint (or chunk) of cucumber before...it's weird and overall not enjoyable. 

The staff keeps the line MOVING which I love as I'm usually in a hurry to GTFO of the food court. 

Don't be confused, it's a Greek(ish) place that's run by Asians. They do not have orange chicken. 

You're welcome"}
{"text":"I had the lamb shank. Not a ton of meat on it, but it was ok. Lots of rice and salad to fill you up. Cheap, but not good eats."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Super fast!

Food: 4/5 Great for a quick lunch
Service: 4/5 Fast and efficient
Environment: 3/5 New
Washrooms: N/A Food court
Worth it?: 4/5 Current go to lunch spot.

I love this place for lunch. The portions are pretty big and the line up may be a bit long but goes super fast. I recommend for those who work in the building and do in t have too much time. 

I go to is the chicken souvlaki mister pitas. They put fries inside which is different but a good combination. It's like a lunch combo all wrapped up. Lol

If you come visit you may see me here on a workday!"}
{"text":"Greek meal for under $10 including taxes for lunch. Large portions, however the meal itself lacked flavour. The rice pilaf basically tasted like white rice. The chicken was quite dry. If you decided to come here, ask for extra tzaziki to add more flavour to the meal."}
{"text":"Owner is very friendly and welcoming. I'm a regular customer here. Pretty satisfied with this place. 
At times, the food can be a bit dry though. Especially when it's been a couple hours after the lunch rush."}
{"text":"where to go for a quick, filling, cheap lunch? Mr Souvlaki will never fail to please all of the above. i've easily been accommodated on days where i'm feeling for more/less potatoes, rice, salad, sauce. it's a nice switch up in an area where lunch can get super pricey."}
{"text":"Ordered a side of calamari here. The calamari was pretty crunchy and tasted not bad. The side was half of the size of a full portion I guess since it was just a handful. I wouldn't mind trying some of the items on the menu as it seems like they have more modern takes on Greek food than other Greek  fast food joints."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets for the price you pay. Don't let the lunch lineup scare you, it moves very quickly (30 seconds per customer - I timed it). It's not 5 star hotel quality food, but for a quick lunch, you can't go wrong with this place. Generous portion and hot food. Really friendly staffs too.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place seems like a fast-food place but this is pretty decent if you think Mr.Greek is expensive. This place is fresh, tasty and healthy. The prices are worth every penny! The service is very fast and they also give you large portions! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Terrible! Chicken was dry and seems it was cooked days ago. Employees alright some of them are rude
Cheap portions and everything was nasty"}
{"text":"I went for what their namesake it all about and it was good enough. The chicken was a bit dry and everything else was alright but nothing fantastic. I suppose if you're in a hurry and need something quick to pick up that this might be an option."}
{"text":"The Mr. Souvlaki is a greek option for those who are in the area.  This has been my go to location for a quick bite to eat as the price is fairly low, and for a while, I thought they were the only location in that food court that took credit card (see review of pumpernickel).

It has standard greek fare (souvlaki, gyros, chicken, etc) that would actually be great if there was a club in the billing and you needed some post party food to close off those munchies.

It recently came under new ownership of an asian lady that man's the front every day.  Really nice lady who recent came from China and is trying to make a living.  She has the old staff working in the back and has really pushed the franchisor to help support her in loyalty programs, new menus, etc.  I love small business owners, because really, they are the future of our economy and so I support this entreprenuer (and hope you do too - this is the case of all the shops at this food court...if you ever are here ask them about it....each story is varied and simply amazing at how these people started up and sustain themselves!)

The chicken dinner, my go to of choice, has changed in flavour profile so I assume they have a new supplier.  Its a good choice for bigger portions at cheaper prices, especially if you want to have a salad (standard lettuce and carrots, though they are stingy on the tomatoes unless you ask).  

Flavour is ok, price is low, but people are great, so I will continue to be a supporter!"}
{"text":"This place is horrendously cheap with toppings - the greek salad doesn't have any cucumbers (they say its in the salad mix, there definitely isn't) and even if you offer to pay for extra toppings they will only throw in one slice of tomato and 1 extra olive and charge you for it. The prices also are horrible - 2 chicken souvlaki sticks comes to approx. $8, which is more than the price of a greek meal with chicken/salad/potatoes/rice.

Service is also usually rude, not a nice experience at all - would not recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and the food is really well cooked favourite food place in that food court"}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars, as I fe it does a pretty good job, and generally meets my expectations, working with what it can, to make it what it is.  Fast.  Cheap(ish).  Available.  
  Don't expect any sort of authenticity here.  Mr Souvlaki is about as Greek as the Subway neighboring it.  However, the lunch time line up is not nearly as long, has no weird bread smell, and is consistent with it's offerings. Albeit, I don't think much of shredded iceberg lettuce, potatoes, or rice, I make do with a tidy chicken wrap for just over a neat fiver.  And, that is ok in my book."}
{"text":"Overpriced shawarma plate and doesn't even taste good. It came out with just chicken and rice ??? Where's all the normal veggies, had to pay 3 dollars more for veggies came up to 18. Everything else was good tho. 

Would I come back no."}
{"text":"A Medium Chicken or Pork Souvlaki Meal is $6.49 + tax and comes with some salad, rice, a (literal) few roasted potato pieces, and 1 kebab. 

I have to admit that the chicken is juicy and their rice always has a nice flufflyness to it, never being too dried out. And they do load the container up with rice so the medium does fill you up adequately for lunch. 

I'm not going to tell you its a great meal, but with the neighbouring food court options of an Ali Baba's, a Thai Express, or a shitty taco place, the reality is that this the better option. But I still wouldn't come with high expectations."}
{"text":"For a food court place, Mr. Souvlaki is pretty good. 

Yes, this Greek fast food joint is a take-out spot in the underground of the Bloor Bay Centre. It is not an appealing food court (not that many are), but the staff at Mr. Souv (my term of endearment, or nickname, for short) get you out of that hellhole pretty quickly and at a fair price.

I have only ever gotten the chicken kabab with salad to go. Try the spicy chicken, it's a whole lot of flavour. I get it without onions, but hey if you don't mind stinky breath, they'll give you onions. Options of hot sauce, do it up. I know they also serve platters with rice and salad, so if you need or want more food, it's there. Potatoes too, I think.  

Total comes to about $6 and you walk away with a decent sized, decent tasting lunch. 

It's good when you're in a rush or it's raining and you don't want to go far."}
{"text":"Gyro salad! This was so good I had it two days in a row. This is part of the Simcoe Place food court which gets a 5 star. Many great places to eat and by far the best food court I've been to."}
{"text":"I had called in asking what time they open (10:30 am). Yet did not expect anything to be ready. Upon arrival, all the food was ready and fresh fresh fresh! The service was beyond kind and hospitable and they had every kind of meat ready from the get-go. Will be going back all the time."}
{"text":"My last experience here was not that good as usually. They were out of couple of items and the gyros they added to my plate was 1/3 of usual amount. Potatoes were not soft enough and the customer service was not that friendly as before."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly tasty!  Another work lunch with a few work folks.  I had the pork souvlaki, and was glad to have been hungry.  The portion sizes are really large.  My DC's are big fans of the spicy chicken dinner.

Apparently it's only open during the day, so it's a good place to have lunch.  Ha ha ha!

It's worth trying, if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Greek souvlaki meat + pita/rice/potato + salad, served as fast food. Don't let the notion of fast food fool you, 'cause it's pretty healthy and delicious stuff. The price and speed of service are awesome too."}
{"text":"I have seen this place so many times, and I always wondered about it as I love a good chicken souvlaki but I never decided to drop in as it's always during the day  when I drive by.. 

When I decided to try it I discovered they have werid hours! They are only open during the day... werid, huh? But they do very good business.

So I tried it for lunch one day and I have been hooked on it ever since, the chicken is always good, never overcooked and the rice is so delicious! 

When I'm in the area I always try to stop in for some chicken soulvaki!"}
{"text":"Why is there no 2.5 stars?  I'll round up because the Spanakopita was pretty good.

This restaurant is located in the Simcoe Place (CBC building) food court.

My standard order here was the Chicken Souvlaki.  Chicken Souvlaki skewer, rice, potatoes, and salad.  Salad is made to order, optional tomatoes, onions, olives, dressing, and Feta cheese. Ample portions. Price: 6.49 plus taxes.  A full dollar less than Jimmy the Geek (or Greek). 

 I used to think this was a good value until someone pointed out that it's better at the Geek, and i started to more closely compare the two.  Previously, I only noticed that you get one less potato than the Geek.  Then I noticed that the rice at Mr Souvlaki just doesn't taste as good, i'm not sure if it's over cooked, another type (parboiled? - yuck), or just missing the grease (mmm .... tasty oily goodness). Also the salad dressing is missing something ..... flavour!

All in all, not bad for 6.49, but I'll spend the extra $1 and get to the Geek.

Spanakopita is good, not too salty like some others."}
{"text":"So I work in the RBC tower and go eat in this food court a lot. Today when i went to grab a gyro, an employee pushing a mop bucket  in the kitchen came to the front and asked me what i wanted, grabbed a pita bread and started making my gyro! I had to tell the guy to wash his hands!!! How he clearly didn't want to wash his hands because all he did was rinse it with water for 3 seconds and wipe with paper towel! This is disgusting and the owner should invest/focus on training employee on handling food!"}
{"text":"Well i ended up here by sheer luck and hunger. 

I will keep this simple since it was more of a take out place. 

First off all when a cultural place is completely run by another culture you wonder how authentic is the food? 

I ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner and not to my surprise it didn't taste like most greek chicken souvlaki dinners taste. 

Although it was still good it had a slightly different flavour to it. 
The potatoes were definitely seasoned completely different than the typical Greek potatoes would of been. Therefore mixing the different tastes altogether (lots of that juice was added to the plate).

Also the rice was much too soggy and so I barely ate it. 

All in all if I wanted to eat authentic greek I would not come here but if I just wanted food and was hungry then I would. 

The good thing is that the place was clean and had a good seating atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is good for the price, will definitely go back. Mostly for the lunchtime crowd, meat is precooked and service is pretty quick."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant in the food court. The salad is great either he chicken. It is fast prepared and I like the menu."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick Mediterranean lunch. The gyro plate stunk. 4 prices of gyro meat left heating in water thrown over an abundance of rice. Absolutely no flavor to either. The Greek salad was passable but if you are looking for decent Mediterranean food skip this joint"}
{"text":"Even by the already-low standards of food-court fare, Mr Souvlaki comes up pretty short.

I was in the mood for a gyro wrap, so after wandering the PATH for much longer than necessary, I found myself in front of Mr Souvlaki. I ordered, of course, the gyro wrap.

It's an exceedingly basic affair. The pita bread is placed on the grill for about a minute (so what's the point, really?) and then a very small assortment of toppings are placed within: tzatziki, lettuce, tomatoes, hot banana peppers, and the gyro meat.

It's edible, I guess, but completely unmemorable. The whole thing is essentially tasteless; the tzatziki is shockingly bland, and the gyro meat, which was just sitting in a little drawer, is so dried out that it doesn't have any flavor left.

At least it was cheap."}
{"text":"Avoid - gross!

Went to pick up a couple of chicken souvlaki dinners one night and the man made everyone wait for some lady to prepare everything while he stood daydreaming and watching soccer on and off.

The rice was like mush - disgusting.  The chicken was okay but they were super stingy and I don't even know what the hell the so-called tzatziki sauce really was but it was watered down to resemble those yogurt drinks - imagine that on top of mushy rice.  Had to throw it all out - wasted almost $20!"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, it's actually not too bad for a Greek place in the food court and it's usually pretty steady at lunch. The guy that prepares the food could work on being friendlier but the lady who is at the cash isn't too bad. All I've ever had was the chicken souvlaki on a pita. The chicken was well seasoned and not too dry, the pita, sauces and toppings were all very fresh and nicely prepared - I didn't have to wear it when I ate it.  My only complaints is that they are very stingy with the feta cheese and only warm the pita for like 15 seconds (or I would have given them four stars).  They have some other non-Greek menu items there such as curry chick peas and butter chicken."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Souvlaki dinner. Undercooked rice, rubbery room temp chicken, soggy salad, runny tzatziki, old tomatoes. There's a reason this costs a couple bucks less than the same food at Jimmy the Greek. 

Nice, friendly staff, though."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite food court type of Greek place. Great for lunch, located right in Cloverdale Mall Etobicoke. Portions are big (I usually add extra falafel and share the portion with my husband) well priced (about $8-$9) and the food is always fresh and tasty. I used to work close by and we came here often. My husband likes their gyros and rice but my favorite is potatoes. Their gyros seemed to be little bit on the dry side when I last visited, and potatoes tend to be too hard sometimes."}
{"text":"Good place for quick souvlaki on the go. Very well priced. If your looking for the authentic thing I would say this isn't it."}
{"text":"This place could be great! But rushed execution and somewhat not very fresh ingredients basically render it into one of the countless fast food locations where food is just \"ok\". Souvlaki tastes like it was cooked a couple days ago and just reheated today - chewy and almost no flavour. Veggies are stale."}
{"text":"A good spot. Really enjoy the Pitas here. Reasonably priced with access from mall exterior."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the reviews are so bad. This place is pretty decent for food court fare. They keep their counters & the food clean & cook food fresh. They're generous with the sides (salad, rice) but stingy with the potatoes & meats. They keep the line moving very well so I have to applaud them for that. 

The food court has been renovated so it looks much  better now. Still, most people tend to get takeout here & not stay. It's nice because at least the food court isn't overly crowded."}
{"text":"Can bargain for an extra piece of chicken when it's close to closing time on a Saturday :)"}
{"text":"Really good, fresh food. Very authentic tasting and for a great price. Definitely a good spot for a quick eat. Will recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"A great bargain lunch place located in the PATH! You can get small pork souvlaki for $5.09 after tax. It is actually not small as the size suggest and it taste not bad.

I suggest mixing it up in your lunch rotation as you will probably get sick of it after having it too many times."}
