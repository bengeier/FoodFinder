{"text":"Hole-in-the-wall bar. . .This is the place.  2 pool tables.  Bartender is pretty nice.  Outdoor smoking deck.  It was karaoke night on wednesday and some of the locals are pretty talented.  One gentleman was shooting pool and singing at the same time.  This provided amusement for me to say the least.  Great place to people watch.  I didn't eat, but the mixed drink was delicious."}
{"text":"If you want a real dive experience this is your place.  Great Food CHECK Great Drinks CHECK Clean Building CHECK Friendly Staff CHECK Cheap Beer CHECK Cheap Drinks CHECK  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Total dive bar.  Your bartender is also your cook.  The beer is cheap but kind of warm.  The patrons are interesting.  Lots of regulars.  Good place to grab a late night drink."}
{"text":"The owner of the bar is of questionable character. She allows thieves to run the bar and she doesn't mind the powerful urine smell that permeates the entire bar at all times. Watch out for Nicky, check the menu for prices and make sure you dont over pay."}
{"text":"Been going there for 10+ years & will continue going there. Small bar, but all you need is somewhere to sit & have a beer ,,, or 2,or 3 Sandy the owner, does a great job with customer service, and is helpful to Good Customer's ... not NO TIPPERS like Shannon P, go SOMEWHERE ELSE!! ... PLEASE!!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for a long time, and I love all the recent updates inside - it looks amazing!! All of the bartenders are fantastic and the locals are welcoming and friendly. Great drink prices too!  The ONLY reason why I can't give this awesome place a \"5 Star\" review is because they took away karaoke every night. My friends and I go other places instead of here because of it. I feel that with great advertising, there would be a bigger karaoke crowd. Or at least karaoke every night during the week... we just miss it!!   But other than that - wonderful in every other way!"}
{"text":"Cheap pitchers of beer. Keeps calm lighting. Karaoke always available. Two pool tables. Outdoor smoking area. Excellent frys made from real potatoes. Never too crowded and great service. Never have to wait long for another drink."}
{"text":"Gabby's is an interesting place and it has its pros and cons. Cons:Prison style toilets (no door on  stall in the mens room) and Unfortunately the owner is a penny pincher and demands that the AC is to remain off so during the summer so it can get pretty uncomfortable. The draft beer also has a problem staying carbonated for some reason. It tends to go flat in like 5min. Pros: the atmosphere and the people are great. The service is awesome and friendly. The owner is friendly and the burgers and wings are fantastic. And if you're a pool player you'll love shooting here. Very competitive and friendly games. Good tournament is held every Tuesday at 6."}
{"text":"I lived literally next to this place for a year and never went in. Finally as i was walking past it, i decided to go check it out. It smelled so good as i was walking closer. I couldnt wait to try it out. Now i have a neurological disability and if i go into a place that has flashing lights, it never ends well. I opened the door slowly to make sure that there we no lights because i wanted to be careful. I see that it is safe so i walk in all excited. Before i even get away from the door, this dumb, skinny witch by the bar glares at me and says \"get out\". I didn't say anything rude or do anything except walk in.  I was totally shocked so i left. I had really wanted to try this place and i get treated horribly before i even sit down. What is wrong with people?? Because of my disability and having to walk in carefully, i get in trouble. She is totally prejudiced and this is totally discrimination."}
