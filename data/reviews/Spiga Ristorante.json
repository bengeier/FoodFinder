{"text":"Mediocre Italian. I got the pizza con pollo, which wasn't awful, but it was definitely not great: served lukewarm, with rubbery mozzarella and a weird sweet chili sauce. My dining companion got the veal special, which seemed okay. The service was cold and unwelcoming.  Pizza was $12; with coffee, lunch for two came to around $31. So not too expensive, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"A nice Italian restaurant with good food, and a not-too-pretentious atmosphere (it's a little worse for wear in places).  They've got a proportionately large patio right along Yonge, which is great for up-close people watching, if a bit noisy; on the other hand, the back of the interior is intimate at night, but just plain dark during the day.  Try the spaghetti agli olio, or the pizza con pollo, which has a nice thin (but still chewy) crust, and a great mix of sweet and spicy flavours."}
{"text":"We've dined/lunched here many times in the 3 years since moving to this area from North York. So, I feel qualified to offer a few comments.   Service has always been friendly and generally fast but not too fast. We have never had a bad meal here. The manicotti are very good. So is the chicken piccata. The daily specials are well worth considering. They serve a bruschetta (included) and the topping is very good -- we ask for baguette rather than the default bread. Spiga is a very reliable go-to neighbourhood restaurant. Hope it stays around for many years to come."}
{"text":"Had a nice time here. Our server was incredibly warm and welcoming. The food was pretty standard, nothing to write home about. The prices were reasonable. 3.5"}
{"text":"Lunch  Ambience/Food/Service/Value: 3.5   Repeat: No   This is likely a good neighbourhood resto for locals."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to go, I'm there once or twice a week! They just know what to do to serve us and make us feel like home, my favourite is the honey mustard salmon I eat that everything I go there and it's always the same delicious flavour."}
{"text":"Very good food, service,and ambience. Everything I expect from a trattoria. We shared the salami/cheese  app, my wife got the pasta special: penne in garlic and oil with seafood. I got the pasta Spiga which has seafood and veal in a blush sauce (weird combo but delicious). We would go back again."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a good friend last night. The service was poor. Our server took a long time to get our order and only came to serve the drinks and food. Not once did she come to check on us. In fact, when she came to pick up our dishes, she didn't offer us dessert. Had she, she would have discovered I had drunk all my water and needed replenishing. Had she, perhaps the 17% automatic tip that displays on the wireless POS machine would have been meted without question.  On to the food. ....Hmm, I ordered the linguini with veal, shrimp and scallops. I was surprised by the generous amounts! But I was disappointed in the weak cream-based tomato sauce. There was something slightly acidic in that sauce that I disliked.  But they brought us a nice complimentary bread and olive plate. I love bread and this was warm with herbs and roasted with tomatoes and olives - yummy.  My friend ordered a pizza - mushroom, cheese and zucchini. She did not rave about the food. As a matter of fact, none of us mentioned the food during our conversation!"}
{"text":"Cute place with delicious artesian pizza for a great price! Ordered the Pizza con Pollo which was absolutely delicious! The place itself is super cute and the service was great. Will be coming back quite often!"}
{"text":"I love Spiga, every time I walk in I'm always greeted with a warm welcome. The servers are knowledgeable and friendly.  The food is fantastic and reasonably priced for such generous portions. You can tell all the food is fresh."}
{"text":"We eat at Spiga all the time and yes we live in the neighborhood.  The bottom line is this is a traditional Italian restaurant run by a family that takes the time to welcome you into their \"home\".  And unlike some uptight Italian eateries they don't mind making changes to suit your tastes.  Make sure you go when Joe is in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"A really nice-looking, fancy-ish Italian restaurant. The food here was pretty good and seemed authentic. I ordered the pizza al salmone - a white pizza with baby arugula and smoked salmon, red onions, capers and mascarpone cheese. It was interesting eating a white pizza for the first time (i.e. no tomato sauce) but I enjoyed it. I wasn't thrilled with the service though, it looked like there was only one lady who was working there who greeted us at the door and seated us and took our orders and then brought our food, and honestly she wasn't all that friendly. She seemed a little curt at times, and then explained the concept of a white pizza to me when I placed my order, but in a slightly condescending way. Honestly, the food here isn't bad, but there are other Italian restaurants in the area which are just as good (Nove Trattoria up the street, for example) where the people are so much friendlier, which makes for a better dining experience."}
