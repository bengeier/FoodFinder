{"text":"The food has gotten a lot better, great staff and clean draft taps, I don't feel like garbage after drinking here much like most places I might frequent. Good daily specials especially a pound of wings and fries for 6.99!  It's what I'm currently eating lol"}
{"text":"The menu is HUGE. As a previous reviewer also noted, the menu is almost too big. Everyone in our party were overwhelmed with the choices and it took forever for us all to decide. An upside to this, though, is that if everyone in your party all want different types of food, this menu will likely accommodate a range of cuisines.  The interior is small and a little dark, but still nice. We sat in the bar area where there is a ginormous TV. We all really enjoyed watching the Leafs game here. Overall, service was decent.   For apps we ordered bruschetta and calamari. I only had the bruschetta which I enjoyed. People who had the calamari said it was good. Everyone also enjoyed their entrees (see pics). I had the Spaghetti Amore which I would totally recommend. My boyfriend said that my entree was a bit better than his (Chicken Club), but I never did try his to compare myself. We all agreed that we would likely return. :)"}
{"text":"So let me preface this by saying the restaurant has only been open for 3 weeks and I new this when the reservation was made. So I was not expecting a perfectly smooth dinner service. They don't have a website up yet and I couldn't find any reviews on Yelp or other sites.   The menu is HUGE! In my opinion, it is far too large. It is almost as though the restaurant doesn't know if it wants to be Italian or a pub.   Our reservation was for 6pm, 4 people on a Saturday. We were seated right away.  Drinks: BEER-Although they have 16 beers on tap, 6 were not available and the individual who sat us, couldn't tell us what they were. Instead, told us to wait for our server. SANGRIA-was on special! 1.5L for $10. The person at our table who ordered it, said it was yummy. COCKTAIL-I ordered from the martini menu. I forget what it was called...it was something tropical. When it came out it was in a hurricane glass, with ice and rimmed with sugar. It was delicious and refreshing but definitely not a martini.  Entree: BUTTER CHICKEN PENNE-the person at our table enjoyed this a lot. The server had recommend any of the butter chicken dishes.     WINGS & BUFFALO CHICKEN POUTINE-when asked if the wings were breaded, the server said yes. They weren't. However the person in our group who ordered this said they were cooked well and tasty and the poutine was delish!  BREADED VEAL & PASTA- large portion comes with 2 pieces of veal, pasta and a flavorful sauce LASAGNA- this was what I ordered. It was ok. Not bad but nothing special (I wouldn't order it again). The strong tomato sauce really over powered the richness of the meat. I would have preferred less sauce or if they had perhaps had mixed a creamy bechemal sauce to cut the tang of the tomato. But this is personal preference.   Dessert-they had a selection of cakes but they are not made in house so we decided to go around the corner for ice cream instead.   Service: OK, like I said, this is a new restaurant so it will take a couple of weeks to work the kinks out but it was clear that our server was not completely familiar with the menu (maybe because it is SO large).  We had 4 people for dinner and the veal entree came out 10 minutes before everyone else's meal. TEN MINUTES!  We asked for our bill and by the time we paid, at least 30 mins had passed.   I will likely go back and try other dishes but I think I will wait about 6 months. I had a hard time rating this restaurant. If it was JUST on food, it would be 3 stars. If it was JUST on service, it would be a 2. Because it is new, I chose the higher rating with hope that the service improves.  Let me know what you think of this place and if you recommend anything I should try next time I am there."}
