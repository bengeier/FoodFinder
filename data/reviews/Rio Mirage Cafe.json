{"text":"We love this place! For good, basic Mexican food it's great! And the service is always friendly and efficient.  Have never had a bad meal here - lunch or dinner.  I especially like the rolled quesadilla."}
{"text":"My grandparents wanted something mexican for dinner and they did not let them down! We arrived on a Saturday around 6:30 definitely busy, the wait was 30-45 min. We put our names on the list and waited outside as the lobby is not large enough to hold many. We counted i believe 4 seats... with elderly this is hard to stand that long.  We soon realized that they did not come outside to call any names, thus having to stand in an overcrowded lobby to wait for our names to be called. Luckily a younger couple gave up the seats to my grandparents.  The wait was not too bad. Once seated we could tell they were definitely busy. Chips and salsa were at the table before we were even greeted by our server. AWESOME! The server was definitely overwhelmed but seemed to handle it pretty well. Food took a little while to get but the chips and salsa definitely held you over.  The chicken and beef unfortunately weren't very flavorful like we had hoped. Even tho the menu described the chicken to have spices it tasted boiled and plain. :(  However the rest of the meal was delicious and it made the grandparents happy to try somewhere else that was for the most part authentic. In the end we will be back to try it out again, maybe next time reservations?? or not on a Saturday!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout 2 El Rico's one Steak and other Chicken and both were really great and meat was seasoned well and very large portions. Will for sure return. Service was fast and accurate."}
{"text":"Tried this place on the recommendation of Yelpers and was not disappointed.  Started off with the fresh chips and salsa which was a welcome treat after a day of hiking.  We also polished of our day with a Mango and Agave Margarita- both were good the latter was excellent.  We had the Fajitas con Pollo and the El Rico Burrito and were not disappointed.  Definitely worth a look and we will be back!  PS- GREAT specials during the week"}
{"text":"If you are looking for \"gringo-fied\"  Mexican food this is the place for you. Chips/salsa bland, ask for hotter salsa, salt your chips, shredded beef taco lacked flavor as did the Chili relleno, refried beans were good, rice mediocre. I see that I am in the minority with a 2 star review, but I dislike settling for Mexican \"wanna be food\". I wager that one point in time Rio served great Mexican, too bad it now does not."}
{"text":"Meh. This is a Mexican version of Applebees, just mediocre food with lots of flair. My husband and I came here after striking out at Vogue and Fresh Wasabi (both closed on Sundays). We weren't expecting a lot, so i guess you can say it met our expectations. Chips and salsa service was prompt. The chips were warm and fresh and the salsa was good too. It kinda reminded me of the salsa at Chili's. I ordered a Margarita, which was large, but had almost zero alcohol in it (this is coming from me, a small Asian who gets drunk off 2 Budlights). It tasted of pure, syrupy margarita mix! I ordered the carne asada which had decent flavor, but was overcooked and tough. They advertise it as sirloin, but tasted more like cheap skirt steak. My husband had the chicken fajitas, which is pretty hard to mess up. His chicken was not seasoned and just tasted like smoke from the grill. The refried beans were a bit bland, but the homemade flour tortillas were fresh and piping hot.   I don't think I will come here again. I think Chili's makes better Margaritas and fajitas."}
{"text":"I love the Rio.  I have to drop by for lunch every time I'm up in the Northwestern part of the valley.  The staff is friendly, courteous and cheerful.  The food is awesome, and generally it is served amazingly quickly after we order.  The chicken chimichanga is my favorite.  My husband will vouch for \"The Ocho,\" or the eighth combination plate as it is known on the menu.  Their margaritas are also good.  I don't order margaritas very often because I am usually disappointed with the flavor, but the Rio's lime/tequila/orange liquor balance is just right.    I have never gotten a bad meal here.  Even the rice is moist and delicious.  I thought all Mexican restaurants considered the rice plate garnish until I ate here.  The salsa and freshly fried tortilla chips that they bring to the table are also really tasty.  Their extra hot salsa (which you can request) is plenty hot, but not as flavorful as their regular salsa."}
{"text":"Visiting a friend in Surprise, AZ and on her suggestion we dined at this restaurant. She'd been told that it was very good and had been wanting to try it.   It was a very nice place, comfotable seating, clean and stocked restroom and friendly staff. We were seated immediately.   I ordered the El Bombero Picado....delicious! I thought the tomato/onion/pepper sauce was slightly sweet and spicy...the strips of beef were tender and well flavored, the Spanish rice and refried beans were excellent. It comes wth tortillas, corn or flour.  My friend order one of the combination plates and enjoyed it as well.  We each ordered a large Ultimate Margarita, which I was told was 20 oz..a few minutes later the server placed a margarita in front of us and walked away. We both looked at the glass and the two straws placed in it. We were a little confused...I guess he misheard our order and thought we were sharing. He was very apologetic and brought another drink right away. No complaints about this...I just thought it was amusing:)"}
{"text":"Pretty nice, sometimes they are out of our favorite sauce and don't tell you before you order it, which is irritating. Over all this place has quality food!"}
{"text":"By far our favorite Mexican food place in the valley. Been here a few times for dates and anniversaries, even if you just want a place for a few drinks they have it the atmosphere makes you feel like you're not in town anymore."}
{"text":"I loved this place!! Best Mexican I have ever had the pleasure to consume!! Margaritas are mummy. They have a Mariachi band!!! Made me smile.   ** I went to the el mirage location  I didn't know there was more than one!!!!!"}
{"text":"This has been our favorite Mexican restaurant for many years.  The last few times we visited we got food that was barely warm.  I got a chicken fajita salad with warm chicken and very few Fajita veggies.  The jalape√±o appetizer was barely warm and looked old.  The other person I dined with said that their dish was just warm. We are used to great food served piping hot.  I think I will have to look for another Mexican restaurant in Surprise. I ate there Jan 16, 2017 and they were not very busy.  I don't understand why we would get cold food.  I hope someone from the restaurant reads this review.  I may try again hoping they will figure out their problems and get back to the great quality we were used to.  For now, it is 3 strikes and you are OUT"}
{"text":"My son and I are trying to find the best Mexican food around Surpise AZ. We came in around 3:30 so it was slow.  The service was very attentive, our booth was clean and the nachos were amazing! The chips were thin hot and chrisp with ample toppings. Yum, we loved them. The portion size was huge, we could have just ordered Nachos. Our meals were both good / average. I'd go just for those nachos again. We're curious if they are always that good"}
{"text":"A couple years ago this place was a gem. Not anymore.   Went in on a Friday evening, service was poor, food ok and the wait was incredible.   Just seemed like everything was out of control.   Maybe next time....."}
{"text":"Staff was super warm, welcoming, and friendly. The guacamole dip appetizer was SO GOOD, honestly the guac was the star of the show. The chicken and shrimp fajitas were good as well as the enchilada plate. Overall it was a tasty meal! P.S did I mention the guac was super good?"}
{"text":"My husband and I picked our meal up for take-out last night after a long day at work. We ordered 2 meals and chips and salsa. Now for take out they charge you for chips and salsa...which i find ridiculous but whatever! Well when we got home our meal was right and we had chips however, we did not receive our salsa. So.....since they charged me 3.25 for the salsa I called to let them know how annoyed I was. Well a girl named Erika answered the phone (Erika was who we ordered from and received our meal from and whom we left a tip for). I simply told ERIKA that i did not receive my salsa and was charged for it she put me on hold....however she just put the phone down without putting me on hold. I overheard her whole conversation....she said to another girl employee \"this bitch who just picked up her order is saying she did not receive her chips and salsa (I ONLY SAID SALSA) I know I put them in there she is totally lying\" then i heard her talk to her manager she said \"this lady on the phone says she didn't get her chips and salsa and she is totally lying do you want to talk to her?\" Then the manager, Alex gets on the phone and I am fuming because this immature, unprofessional, rude young lady by the name of ERIKA has called me a liar. Before explaining my situation I told him everything i overheard  from his employee. He said he wasn't surprised because she is a kid and it is hard to get good employees and he also said that a lot of people lie about not getting their food, REALLY? His comments and lack of caring I found disturbing.  He mentioned he was just filling in for another manager that he doesn't usually work there.  Reading other reviews it seems that a lot of people have dealt with some terrible servers and hostesses. I would NOT recommend this place!! UGGG"}
{"text":"Pretty good chips and salsa, the place is decorated nicely. The food was alright, nothing bad but nothing great. Very cheesey and bland for me. But overall service was nice and attentive otherwise would have given 2 stars. Will probably try them again and get something with extra peppers added or something to waken up the food. Also the sopapillas or however you spell them were pretty bomb!"}
{"text":"Great place. Has awesome lunch specials. Chips and salsa brought to your table rite away free of charge!! Can't go wrong with any choice. Food is amazing..."}
{"text":"This is a good mexican food restaurant, not the greatest I've had and certainly didn't live up to all the hype I hear from others (at least not for me). Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but the items I've tried are average with other similar restaurants. The place is always packed, so I might be in the minority with my opinion. I usually get take-out and my biggest gripe with Rio Mirage is that they give you only a *teeny* bag of chips and an extremely small amount of salsa (seriously, about two tbsp) with the take-out order (order of 3-4 entrees). Pretty annoying when you get plenty of chips and salsa when you dine-in (and also compared to the chips and salsa you get with Macayo's take-out). If you ask for more chips and salsa they will charge you for it. So take-out orders, if you like a lot of chips/salsa be aware."}
{"text":"Staff good! Decor is awesome! Food is gross & greasy! Salsa is the only good thing! I wouldnt go back!"}
{"text":"Best mexican food in town love the staff and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Went once. Las Fuentas is sooooo much better! No need to go back here"}
{"text":"Benita Wykert Eight of us went to lunch at this wonderful restaurant. Every plate was not only pleasing to the eye but to the palate as well. The portions were more than abundant and the service was excellent. There was even a singing guitarist that entertained us both in Spanish an English.  Every employee at this restaurant made sure to welcome us and make sure we had everything we needed even though we weren't in their area.  It's agreed that it was the best Mexican food in the area. A+ from our table."}
{"text":"We had dinner on a weekday and though it was busy the service was a bit weak. Green corn tamales, and the chicken burro/taco were good. The margaritas were big and pretty good. The guacamole was good but not great. We would go back as the atmosphere and food were better than average. This gets 4 stars because it's in surprise. In central phoenix or Scottsdale I'd be a bit more critical..."}
{"text":"We eat here a couple times a month, the service is always friendly and the food is good."}
{"text":"My family and I come here all the time. We have tried a variety of things on the menu and have always been satisfied.   I am not Mexican so I do not claim to know what authentic Mexican food taste like but I do know what good food tastes like we are always happy when we come here. The staff is always friendly and there is plenty of seating. The drinks are good and the food is always prepared well with large portions.  Overall this place will not blow you away but it is a good place for family lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Better than Macayos, but we all know that's not saying much. Unfortunately, it's a little pricey for mexican food and really not all that great. If I really have a craving for good authentic Mexican food I usually find myself driving into tow to Carolinas at Peoria and 91st ave."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Mexican food I have had so far, since moving to Arizona. I always get the chicken enchiladas with beans and rice, you get a huge portion for a great price, and service is always fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Surprise!  Steak Fajitas are pretty awesome.  I am a big eater and the amount of food they give you is incredible.  Consistently great Mexican food every time I go.  There salsa is great as well.  Good job and keep up the good work, I defiantly will be back!"}
{"text":"We are new to the area and trying out different restaurants primarily due to the heat....who wants to cook at home with 110+ degree temperatures:)  As we came from Southern California finding a good Mexican restaurant was high on our list.  We were there on a Tuesday around 4:30 PM and were seated right away.  The staff was attentive and professional.  We were pleased with the salsa and the guacamole dip.  My husband deemed his chile rellano the second best he'd ever had.  I would like to be able to get a taco or burrito a la carte versus with rice and beans.   The portions very generous and we both had leftovers to take home.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This place was really good.  I ordered two enchiladas, one chicken one beef.  I took off a star because my beef enchilada wasnt very meaty, but my chicken one was, also the 2oz guacamole was tiny and the 4oz salsa was huge didnt hold up to the size listed. The chips and salsa are fresh and the side beans and rice were great.  I really enjoyed how flavorful and moist the rice was, since side dishes seem to always be an afterthought, but not here, they seem to take just as much pride in making their sides.  Took the order to go, and everything was nicely placed in boxes and in a nice bag, no skimping to be had just because I took my order to go.  I will go again if ever in the area again."}
{"text":"I use to go to their original location many years ago with coworkers.  When I found myself up in Surprise today with my family I suggested we give this location a try.  We were seated quickly drink order was taken chips and salsa were served. My husband asked for a hotter salsa and they said sure but never brought it.  Food was served it was hot and plentiful however the food really lacked flavor and salt.  My husband made a joke that they must dumb down the flavor since it is so close to Sun City.  I was really disappointed with food.  It was quite bland and the cost of the meal was overall high for what you get.  Wont be back."}
{"text":"Classic traditional Sonoran food.  Not Tex Mex, so skip the fajitas and instead try the tortilla soup (best in the Valley) and the chile relleno and anything with machaca beef and the tamales and enchiladas.  Margaritas are VERY good and if you want to try something unique, try their mango margarita or the special one with chili powder.  For light eaters, the shrimp cocktail is great, using only the best jumbo Guaymas shrimp.  This location has lovely decor and you will have a lovely meal if you order the right things!  Don't be afraid to ask the waiter/waitress for help in ordering."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, and that was the best part of our experience.  We were seated, told they were going to bring us menus, and left to sit...and sit...and sit.  After about 10 min, a woman said in passing that she would be there in a minute to take our drink order.  When she returned 10 min later, we ordered drinks and mentioned that we would really like some menus please.  She produced the menus fairly quickly.  When she returned with our drinks, we were quite anxious to order because we had already been at our table for 30 min.  After ordering our food, it took an additional 30 minutes before our food was brought out.  One of our entrees was incorrect (chicken fajitas instead of steak fajitas), but we didn't say anything because we were afraid it would take too long to correct.  Again, food was good, but this restaurant seriously needs to do something about it's speed and attention to customers."}
{"text":"The Chicken Fajitas were great lots of food would eat them again.  The Tamales not so much came cool and super dry."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but I will never go back there again. Do to a large part of management and ownership. As I waited I've seen their employees get chewed out in Front of  customers by this woman who seems to be the owner. I don't think she's ever been to management training, but I got the feeling that she doesn't know what she's doing. She's seems stuck up and rude.   As for the food, it's mediocre at best. The service by the waiters is good. They do have good chips and salsa. But I would not support establishment that does not treat their employees well."}
{"text":"pretty good but not amazing, probably best surprise has to offer for mexican food"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner was sat immediately and I tried something new too. I had the Rio Burrito and it's was a great treat,  the guacamole appetizer was fresh and chips arrived hot to the table too more than once. The only draw back was we had to ask for drinks to be refilled and mom's original choice was a bit dry however she replaced it with the shrimp fajitas and those were 5 stars. Truly i would have given 4.5 review but this app does not let me right now. I will be going back and cannot wait to try another new dish."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican Restaurant! Good food and Good prices. Never had a bad experience and we go there weekly."}
{"text":"While we were told it would be 20 minutes we were seated within ten minutes. Our waiter Carlos was quick to arrive, taking our drink orders. Our order arrived after a reasonable time, hot and tasty. Portions were big, we took half of each order home for another meal two nights later.   We tried this place a few years ago and were disappointed so we were hesitant to return but friends have raved about it and the Yelp reviews were helpful. We will return!"}
{"text":"In town for a funeral and needed catering same day for a party of 15.  Rio Mirage in Surprise was very accommodating to my request same day . I had contacted the El Mirage location and they told me no  that they required 24 hour notice. The food was excellent . The guests loved the food and locals will certainly visit the the Surprise location ."}
{"text":"Six others and I went on a Monday night. It was not that busy (8 tables filled) when We arrived but it took 5-7 minutes to be seated. It took another 7-10 minutes to get water and chips to the table. Food was average once it finally came out. More people were seated while we were here so they did get busier. Overall, not impressed."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food. I'm from Texas originally and very particular about my Mexican food / Tex-Mex and this place had great food and great service and great atmosphere. I ordered a tamale and it was huge and had some of the best barbacoa  on the inside. Also, couldn't get enough of the salsa!"}
{"text":"Really great vibe and great employees. I am guilty of coming in just before closing and the bar tender was great. She took care of us and didn't rush us. Dania was fantastic"}
{"text":"Good food, freshly prepared, but the wait staff was amateurish. The appetizer was delayed and our main course arrived before our tableware. The \"salsa\" wasn't bad, but it seemed that somebody completely forgot any hot pepper. Overrated."}
{"text":"Was told 15 minute wait. Hostesses were running around, looking like they weren't sure of what they were doing. One looked like she had an attitude and not friendly. Once we were seated (25 minutes later) we ordered drinks. Made the mistake of having some of the complimentary chips and salsa before getting our drink order. Salsa wasn't spicy, was actually very good but I got an unusually spicy bite and nearly choked. Waitress was very friendly. All food dishes were delicious. Only one thing wrong with mine was the shell tasted like it was deep fried in old oil. Since I was too full to eat it anyway, no biggie. People right behind us were celebrating a birthday. One girl at their table was very loud and should have been cut off. My husband got a crotch shot of her so lucky him. It got very peaceful after their table left. All in all was better than Macayos up the road (they changed their menu about year or two ago and it doesn't taste authentic anymore). We will stick with Rio cafe. 4 stars instead of 5  for hostess and taco shell."}
{"text":"Great place. Enjoyed every bite. Awesome decor and great service. Margarita was huge but did not have much alcohol in it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars."}
{"text":"I have to admit -- i'm a fan.   The place is awesome, great establishment, large booths, and a friendly staff...  The food is great too, if you get specific items, I found that when they say \"hearty chunks\" of meat, its usually not the case, most items are soupy and over sauced, but its really yummy and you get a lot for what you pay for."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and decent prices. Clean, margaritas are delicious. Fajitas are very good as well. Very family friendly place. The only downfall is extremely slow, and not very friendly service."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant in Surprise. The food is consistently good, portions are large, and prices are fair. We have always gotten good service as well."}
{"text":"It was a little on the warm side in the restaurant but it is 117 out in august. The service was fantastic, we had drinks at the bar while we waited to be seated. The bartender was very friendly. I had the fajita chimichanga and my husband had the El Rico with steak. Both items were flavorful and well prepared. The El Rico is spicy so beware."}
{"text":"It can be difficult to find good Mexican food but this place got it right. Only complaint was maybe they held our food under a heat light while waiting for the all our table's food to be ready, two of the dishes were a bit cold.  Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Food here was awesome. Chip's are made onsite & the salsa was made fresh as well.  Legit house margarita. Good kid's menu. Wife & I split the chicken/spinach enchilada plate & were full. I LOVED the Jalape√±o Torito's. Waiter was friendly & knew the menu. If you want real Mexican faire, this is the place..."}
{"text":"I'm glad I did not see the negative reviews as I would not have even tried this place. I had a red chili beef tamale and a beef taco. The tamale was REALLY  good, taco was average. The beans and rice were great and the service was good too. No complaints. Would eat there again."}
{"text":"Ate there last night, very busy, waiter was busy he hardly had time to talk to us, had to wait forever to get a second drink, food so so, I had two tacos, but the big shocker, shame on us for not looking at booze prices, skinny margarita $9.75 in a tiny glass, we won't go back unless someone else is buying. Lobby full of people waiting a ton of empty tables, must be short on wait staff."}
{"text":"My fiance took me and our son to the Rio Mirage Cafe because she knows we love Mexican food. The service was bad and the food was horrible at best. The food was not cooked all the way and was cold when it did finally get to us. We were highly disappointed and would recommend Taco bell before I would Rio Mirage Cafe.."}
{"text":"so i accidently found this place.. and i am so glad i did.  food is wonderful, family owned!  service was great!  margarita - coyote was amazeballs!"}
{"text":"The two stars are for lack of Senior discounts. I was looking for Senior discounts for my mom.....      I read on one review app that this restaurant gives Senior didcounts.  IT Does NOT give Senior discounts.  When I took mom   there 1.2.17, I asked the waitress about it and She said that they Do Not give senior discounts. I give them 4 Stars for food and -0-   Zero Stars for such terrible booth seats.   Sitting at a table is not private."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh.  This is seriously the BEST fish taco I've ever  had!  Was it the fish?  The cabbage?  The salsa? The big slices of avacado?  Whatever..... here fishy fishy! Everything that was ordered at our table was amazing.  We will def be back!!"}
{"text":"Service is fabulous, food not so great. The food used to be much better but then a couple of years ago they had a radical change in how hot all the food was - not in temperature, but in seasonings. I now think twice about going there even though the service is top notch I end up going elsewhere now."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but it seems to depend on which nights you go. It's Hit or miss...but good overall. They always seem a bit rushed...which some places are like that I understand Turn around time but let us relax a but ya know."}
{"text":"Westside Girls Need Lovin Too, Part One.   So my Westside girls call me up and want to do happy hour apps and drinks, but in Surprise.  Arrrghh!!  After the initial shock, I hop in the Steveymobile and start looking forward to checkin out Surprise again.  It's been a while.  So 35 miles and 90 minutes later I roll up to an appetizer platter and margarita waiting, a stool cushion fluffed and the bar area hopping with suburbanite foodies in full force.  The bartender was very quick at the gun and seemingly busy or slammed.  He looked put out any time we asked him for a refill, a plate or a cold mug, almost to the point of dismissiveness.  The food wasn't much to crow about either.  The taquitos barely had any meat inside. The quesadillas were average. The guacamole was kind of bland.  It was very reminiscent of an El Torito or something.'  My biggest beef with the place -- a HAPPY hour that goes from 2 - 5 PM?  WTF is that all about??  There are hardly even any workers in Surprise who are able to benefit from this.  Should they rename this the Surprise Unified School District happy hour? Most people in Surprise don't even get home from their Downtown Phoenix jobs until 6.  Those are the most worthless happy hour times ever.  My Westside girls had never been there before (even though it's relatively new) and name-dropped several places there and in El Mirage that are better.  For Westside Girls Need Lovin Part Deux, I have forcefully suggested Glendale or Peoria.  Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Excellent food, margaritas and service. Our new \"go to place\" since El Tepeyac SUCKS."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience at the Rio Mirage. The food was BLAND, chicken was dry, tasted like it was microwaved. Server forgot my nieces order & my uncles water. We weren't given plates or napkins. Just an awful experience. I will definitely suggest this place to people who don't like authentic Mexican food with high prices."}
{"text":"We tried Rio while visiting family in AZ  and it was great mexican. The margarita was awesome and the service was good."}
{"text":"The place is authentic and fun inside but the food was Marginal at Best. Menu was very limited. I asked for veggie options and??? My waiter didnt seem to understand. Ok I'll have fish tacos, my mahi in my tacos was wayyy over cooked like rubber. It was Monday night and not very busy but took forever to get drinks and food."}
{"text":"Went against my better judgement and accompanied a group of friends here the other night. (5 of us) The food hasn't gotten any better since my last visit and the service has declined. We saw our server a total of three times. The first time was taking our food and drink order, the second was delivering our food, and the third was dropping off our checks. Which was another joy entirely. Five people, four checks. Eighteen percent gratuity charge. Bad food, bad service, and they're still trying to squeeze an extra $20 out of us. So I ask to speak to a manager and this is the best part he comes over and explains to  me that in the menu if I read the fine print I would've seen that they charge an extra gratuity fee for parties over four people.  I shouldn't have to read \"fine print\" to eat at a restaurant. And we would've left decent tips despite the less than satisfactory service. But since they tried to pull a fast one and then argued about it, she got no tip at all from any of us. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Went there last night with friends. Was a bit apprehensive as the last time I was there the food served almost looked like it was from last week. Well, we were not disappointed. The service was horrible. We were a party of four and were served 1/2 of small salad bowl of chips with one little container of salsa. It was evident that our server was totally disinterested in serving us!  After asking for lemon with our water, we had to wait about 20 minutes later after asking someone else. When our food was served, my friend had just picked up her taco to put it in her mouth when the waiter whisked her plate from her and gave her another plate saying he gave her the wrong order. This large fellow was extremely rude to us. It was obvious he didn't like that we didn't order drinks. Only one person in our party ordered a couple.  I had the cheese enchiladas. The first one I ate was okay but the second one could not even be cut with a sharp knife.  It was tough as could be. The beans were okay but rice had no flavor and was dry.  This was my second time to this restaurant was it will be my last. The other three people in our party was just as dissatisfied as well."}
{"text":"The service here is excellent and the food is probably the best Mexican food in surprise.  Their shrimp tacos are Delicious and the fajitas aren't bad.  Skip the margaritas as they are flavorless and have zero tequila in them."}
{"text":"This place is decent for an American style Mexican food.  The rice was the best part of my meal. I had the steak tacos and the meat was well seasoned and the size of the tacos were huge. My son had a carne Asada burrito  Not in the menu but they still made it and he enjoyed it. My niece has a combination plate with a tamale and chicken enchilada. She said the tamale had a good spice to it and the enchilada was really good. My boyfriend had the tortilla soup had good flavor. Chips were warm and the salsa was good too. We were treated by the hostess in a very friendly manner and then welcomed by our waitress. Overall this place was good and we will come again if we are ever in surprise"}
{"text":"Staying in this area has had its benefits. One of those is rio mirage!  Great food decent service but the most addictive thing on the planet is the reason to come here!!!  Flaming Toritos!!  Jalape√±os stuffed with cream cheese, wrapped in bacon and grilled. Served with a jalape√±o ranch type dressing and pico de gallo!!  Deliciosa!!  If they ever take these off the menu we might have to start a revoluti√≥n!"}
{"text":"Ordered: Cheese crisp with green chili's, chimichanga with machaca, green corn tamales.  Cheese crisp with green chili's: Good amount of cheese to tortilla ratio. The tortilla could use more crispness -higher heat and some butter, maybe pre cook just the tortilla with the butter first partially. Green chili's need flavor, in a rich buttery cheesy dish like this, the green chili is supposed to add some sweet, spicy, freshness.  Chimichanga with machaca: outer tortilla was cooked well and not burnt anywhere, but too big of a tortilla. The inner tortilla was too chewy without enough amount of crispy tortilla. The machaca was a solid pulled beef with flavor, but fell short of other machaca experiences. Please visit mi nindito in Tucson to see what I'm talking about.  Green corn tamales: Nice and sweet tamale with flavor which is rare. A little dry but with a subtle green sauce that solved the problem. My only issue was the addition of cheese. It added nothing to a sweet and mildly spicy dish.   Overall if you are in the surprise area this spot is worth a visit. They have all the right stuff but just needs some slight adjustments."}
{"text":"So far the best Mexican food in Surprise!  My favorite is the carne asada chimi!  Not many Mexican restaurants in AZ have good green chili but Rio does a great job in this area!  My entire family enjoys dining here.  Even my daughter who doesn't like Mexican food and always gets the cheeseburger has a good time!  Great margaritas!"}
{"text":"Service was horrid salsa tasteless waited over 30 minutes for draft beer. Still waiting for the food. Ugh"}
{"text":"I went here with my entire family and was really unhappy.  The food tasted like it had been microwaved 30 seconds before bringing it out to me. I ordered the enchiladas (chicken) and it had ABSOLUTELY no taste!  The chicken in the middle was cold, the beans were tasteless and the sour cream I asked for was sparse.  On top of that, about 12 hours later both my husband and I ended up spending the evening over and on the bathroom toilet.... The only thing we had shared was the salsa. Our daughter, who had the same problem about 4 hours after we did, had also eaten the same salsa. I have no idea if it was a coincidence or not, but the experience was enough to put me off. I'll probably stay away from there now on, even though my family is certain that we were all suffering from the stomach flu, rather than being affected by anything we ate, I just can't get past the combination of bad food and the stomach flu in the same 12 hour period. Point of interest.....we used to go to the old location off of Grand avenue and never had a complaint....things have changed!  We really hoped the new location would be as good!"}
{"text":"Every time we go it is constantly delicious! We always get the red chili dinner split in the kitchen. Perfect servings for two for under 20 dollars you can't go wrong with anything though! Everyone is always friendly and it's mostly always very quick! Check this place out for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicioso every time.  Hot food, outstanding service.  Clean restrooms.  Yeah!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place five stars because it is in surprise. So far the best Mexican food I've tried here which isn't saying much considering I've been to Macayos and that place is awful. Any other place like southern Cali I'd still give it a 4. Ordered the rio Rico burrito( I think that's what it's called) with shrimp for 16.50 and oh my yum was it delicious!! Every bite had big juicy shrimp, mushrooms, peppers, onions, and the sauce was amazing. It came with refried beans and rice which were good as well. The chips and salsa were delicious too. All in all everything was delicious and we will be back again. It's better than a-ok.  Service- great and attentive. Cleanliness- good.  I know good Mexican food and what I had tonight was it."}
{"text":"This place probably has the best Mexican food I've had in Surprise, AZ. It has a wonderful atmosphere and decor and the food is always hot and delicious.  Just a warning, you better come hungry. The portions are huge. The nachos literally come on a pizza pan and are enough for 4 people, lol.  The soups are awesome and taste homemade. I definitely judge a Mexican restaurant by their salsa and chips and Rio Mirage has some of the best. Their salsa is very fresh and I love the cilantro in it and the chips are always warm and fresh. Bottom line, you won't be disappointed and you'll leave with a full belly and a smile on your face. Great place to take the family or a special someone for a romantic date."}
{"text":"The food here is decent as well as the service. I moved here from Chicago about 8 months ago and I still haven't found a good Mexican restaurant. This place is better than the other Mexican restaurants I've tried so far. However, the food could use a little more flavoring and more juiciness. Hopefully I can find a better Mexican restaurant soon."}
{"text":"Great food! The environment is so authentic and staff is very professional, nice and presentable. I've been to both locations, love the live music and comfortable environment. I ordered taco plate and my friend ordered fish tacos which she said were the best she's had, my sister ordered the spinach with cheese enchiladas. All very good and prepared neatly, highly recommend this place if you're craving some good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Have seen a lot of people I know coming here, so had to try. Never ever, ever again! Service was absolutely horrible. Food was also horrible. To top it off I was sweating the entire time I was there. I will spend $120 on a nice quiet cool place next time.  So disappointed !!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I loved the decor, it felt very warm and welcoming. I don't know why people are giving this place such a bad review. This is going to by our new spot for dates and dinner. We were so happy with how friendly our server was we gave him a $20 tip. That never happens."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and got the taco lunch special.  Was disappointed to only get 1 taco plus rice and beans.  Most places give 2 tacos. Meal wasn't anything special and haven't had a reason to go back.  Service was OK, once again, nothing speci"}
{"text":"I love consistency. This place always performs. Wish the Creme de Poblano was around more often. The El Rico is my go to and their salsa is perfect."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant, ever! They great food, amazing service, and the staff are nice. JJ and Ramone, are the best waiters in there they make people laugh and make sure that their customers are having a good time. I definitely suggest this restaurant and waiters to anybody that hasn't been there."}
{"text":"The food is pretty average with the exception of their beef soup (caldo de Rez) and the menudo. This place is a little pricy but the ambiance is nice, so go in and try the two dishes I recommend and you can't miss"}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch, we have been many times in the past, it seems the menu has changed again with higher prices! I ordered the Carna Asada and it was so unbelievably tough with huge vein inside! The flavor was very good but had a hard time chewing it! I don't think we will be going back any time soon or at all!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.... my husband and I just found it and can't believe I have lived here all these years and have been missing out on such FABULOUS food!"}
{"text":"Our first time at Rio Mirage Cafe was totally awesome. We were with a group of eleven guests which didn't lessen the service, quality of food, and fun. The entire staff was on their game from when we first arrived and until we paid our checks. This included helping our group to celebrate a special occasion with important help from the staff. Everyone's drink (adult and non) and meal (wide selection of orders) was exactly as ordered and very delicious. We will be back. Sincerely, Karen & Art Huseonica, Sun City, AZ"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm what a fun and authentic Mexican restaurant. This type of food is always our go to choice when going our to dinner, so why not try every different place? I just love the decor and atmosphere here. My husband and I ordered the guacamole dip and since it was sooo stinkin hot and we were at a late lunch early dinner time of the day we shared the steak fajitas. It was more than enough food for us to split and they could have rolled us out the door we were so stuffed! The steak was super tender, the veggies were fresh and most importantly for Arizona summers, the a/c was crankin Great place, we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is my new hometown spot!  Just moved to Surprise a year ago and have fallen in love with Rio Mirage.  The service has been great each and every time, the food hot, delievred quickly, and the margs - yummy.  Affordable too.  My cousin and I hit up Rio Mirage every couple of months for margaritas and everytime, we get the coolest server.  They're so friendly and engaging.  I strongly recommend Rio Mirage!"}
{"text":"6PM on Saturday night. Greeted with a smile, everyone is friendly and makes sure your welcomed. Almost makes you think they are a weird Mexican cult  food is good, portions are huge and it's not two noisy if your with a group. I brought my parents. About a 20 min wait, you can sit at the bar or open sweating is in front for the bar."}
{"text":"Over priced Fake Mexican food.  The restaurant has a clean friendly atmosphere and the waiters are very friendly but at the end of the day the food is ok at best."}
{"text":"We like to come here and sit at the bar and talk and laugh with the bar tender. Juan Carlos makes the best mojitos in the west valley. Staff are always and professional and friendly! Try the enchiladas with the mixed green and red sauce, forgot the name!"}
{"text":"The menu has changed... the terrible salmon from before wasn't even on there, so that was a plus from the start.  We ordered the pitcher of the agave margaritas... needs more tequila when you are going to spend $26 on that!!  Other than that... everything was great.  The chile relleno was AWESOME.  Cheese enchilada... AWESOME.   The wandering bard (I call him that, but he was mexican... don't be thinking British) was pleasant and humorous. :)"}
{"text":"Although I prefer the original location in El Mirage, this location is a solid spot to visit. I can't put my finger on it, but the food at the El Mirage location is just a bit better and the service is just a bit more efficient. Not that the food or service here is bad. Maybe it's just something about the original. I don't know. You will get a solid meal here with no-nonsense service. Your drinks will be kept full, and you will leave feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"I give it a one for the fact my buddy and I did not shit our pants on the way home... That being said, it was due entirely to the extreme efforts our colons put forth!!   DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU LIKE MILD FOOD POISONING!"}
{"text":"Ok, let me start by saying you don't come here for truly authentic mexican food.  You come here for a sit-down restaurant experience, chips and salsa, 99cent margaritas.  It's just like the big chains in the valley you come to know what to expect with mass production.  So looking at it like that I think they have decent food and big portions.  The service is hit and miss but I've never had a truly bad experience or horrible food, just mediocre."}
{"text":"Tried Rio Mirage for the first time.  My family really enjoyed the atmosphere and friendly staff.  We all ordered combo meals and were very impressed with how fast the food arrived and the bonus was it tasted great.  My corn tamale was fluffy and fresh, which I can't say for other places.  My chicken taco was not greasy which is hard to find.  We will go back!"}
{"text":"The food here was really good and they usually provide endless chips and salsa. However, the service we experienced was terrible. I'm not exactly certain what the circumstances were for the restaurant, but it was incredibly difficult to retain the attention of the staff and especially our server with regard to placing drink orders, drink refills, placing our food order, requesting silverware, and even a chair to sit in.   We were sat at 6 pm and were told by the hostess that they were grabbing one more chair to fit our party of 8. We did not see that hostess again for 30 min. Luckily we were able to ask a bus boy for help with locating us a chair. Our drink orders were not taken until 6:20p, and we requested drink refills twice before our food order was taken 45 mins later after we successfully flagged down our server on a fourth attempt, at which point another server assisted with our refills as our server took our order.  While waiting, we also requested refills of chips and salsa multiple times without result.   Our food did come pretty promptly, however they had one order completely wrong and had to have it remade while we, of course, waited further.   The table we were sat at was so close to an entry way that a party at our table was jolted by staff every time they walked through, and at one point staff physically moved her chair to move through the entry way to sit another party.   Im not certain if this was a situation where the restaurant was understaffed and/or the server was having a really off night, but communicating something around what was happening would have put our table at ease, especially after we voiced that we've put in the same request multiple times without result. Looking back, I would likely have gotten up and left at some point before our food orders were placed, because we certainly did not receive what we paid for.   As much as I like their food, this experience was enough to encourage me to not come back."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely average, but the service the night we went there was abysmal. We sat at the table for 15 minutes before getting a drink order taken. 30 minutes later we had to ask where the hell our drinks were. Same for ordering and getting dinner. We spent 2-hours waiting, and 20 minutes eating. The local manager did his best to put lipstick on this pig, but good-gad-almighty, if your time has any value whatsoever, you don't have the time for Rio Mirage."}
{"text":"my girlfriend and i have been there twice, and twice we have gotten upset stomachs, there were green bugs in the menus, friendly people, but get passed off to a different person both times, stay away from this place"}
{"text":"Came here to meet up with friends in the bar.  Bartender was ok,  was hard to get menus for dinner and drinks listed weren't all available.     Only two of us ordered dinner and it came fairly quick but wasn't quite how we ordered it.   I didn't ask to change since it was getting late for us.     Food presentation was typical and taste was just ok.   Note sure we would be back for that."}
{"text":"Great vegetable  & beef soup!caldo de res.lots of fresh vegetables and meat. The broth is very tasty and rich.Staff is friendly and very helpful in describing menu choices."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  We were told 5-10 minutes to get our table, but it was more like 15-20.  The service was equally slow and disinterested, and generally crummy.  My mother is gluten intolerant and asked two servers if the fajitas with corn tortillas was safe, and was given a clear \"yes.\"  This morning she is doubled over in pain.  My shrimp tacos were fair. The shrimp was fine, but their corn tortillas are just plain poor.  The texture and flavor of them are bad.  Also, the tortillas that came with the chicken fajitas were all stuck together and we had to wait to get a replacement set.  At 8pm, the cleaning schedule in the men's room showed the last cleaning was at 1pm, and needless to say the stalls were filthy.  From the taste of the soda, I am guessing their fountain lines have not been cleaned in some time either.   So all tolled, you can do a lot better for Mexican food in Surprise!"}
{"text":"really good food!  it's no wonder they have two locations only minutes away from each other and both locations are packed every night!  the wait staff are all really friendly and the margaritas superb!"}
{"text":"Muy Delicioso! Awesome margaritas. Ask the bartender to make the house special, it's not on the menu."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & the food is delicious ! Creative margaritas. Found it here on yelp , glad we stopped in . Spinach & chicken enchiladas are delicious, the coyote margarita is too ! You know if the chips n salsa is great it's a winner !!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Taco Tuesday margaritas are the best. Love the shrimp tostada appetizer too. I go here often as I can ole"}
{"text":"Normally very good Mexican food in the valley.  Tonight, I ordered a medium house margarita.  They make a pitcher at a time. My drink came from the bottom of the pitcher and was very watered down. I mean it was watered down lime water. Could barely taste, no, I could not taste any tequila.  Wife said her drink was a short pour.  She could not taste the rum. She ordered a pina colada.  Food was good.  Watered down cocktails, at $15 for two drinks, ouch.  Normally there is a manager floating around the place asking how things are. Tonight there was no one to say anything to."}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican food. Not even real Mexican food. My son didn't like his sandwich. Took one bit and said it was nasty. The food was ok. But the strawberry margarita was amazing."}
{"text":"Very good experience. Friendly, efficient service from the time we walked in the door till the time we left. They had a guitar player walking around, maybe because it was Father's Day. The food was absolutely delicious, seemed like authentic Mexican cuisine. Definitely gained new customers!"}
{"text":"Love the food , staff, bar, patio, and prices.Every chance the wife and I get to sneak away we head over here and have an awesome margerita and a burrito, Sunday brunch great ,patio outside is fun!!"}
{"text":"Superb service!  Had the Carne Asada plate.  Tender well marinated meat covered with grilled onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes.  It was served with a side of rice, beans and fresh salsa.  Very flavorful.  The restaurant was very lively with a quaint unique feel to it."}
{"text":"Been to this location as well as the El Mirage location several times--best chimichanga around. It's pretty authentic. My parents love to go here when I visit. Their $1 margarita happy hour is the best. Can't beat it! The staff is friendly and attentive. The Surprise location is definitely more \"toned down\" as someone else noted.... I mean, there are a lot of \"early bird special-ers\" there lol.  Give it a go--you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I got the El Rico. It's a fried and baked burrito topped with Monterrey Jack cheese and jalape√±o cream cheese. I opted for the steak and I was pleasantly surprised. Typical Mexican food can be a bit bland but this was the exception to that rule. The steak was exceptionally well seasoned and the jalape√±o cream cheese gave it just enough heat without being overpowering. I will be back."}
{"text":"I have not been here since 8/10/12. Today we stopped by and had lunch. The food tasted good the service was good but about 20-30 minutes after eating we were all sick. We had bad cramps and to put it nice it was coming right out. Don't think I will be back called and left a message to have a manager call but never heard anything back from one. Will let you know if I hear anything."}
{"text":"Came here with coworkers for lunch and to escape both the office and the blaring sun. Once inside the cool dim lobby I was greeted by the hostess and taken to be seated. Inside the place looked like any El Torito back home. I ordered the chicken fajitas which were served sizzling. Found them juicy and worth it."}
{"text":"I order the steak fajitas made a big mistake with that. 16$ of a couple of steak strips and it was not even sizzling when they brought it out.  They put lettuce in there as well. What do you do when you heat up lettuce it wilts.  Thought it would come with home made tortillas nope taste like store bought.  The beans were also bland. Not a fan of this place at all. Maybe might try this in the distance future but won't be ordering the fajitas."}
{"text":"This seriously is one of the best Mexican restaurants in town. The food was delicious, my husband had the Rico burrito and I had the chicken fajita burrito both were excellent. The chips and salsa was also really good. We loved the decor, service was great. It is a bit pricey though. Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"My family and I love this restaurant--both locations! We go to one or the other almost every Wednesday night. The food is fresh and flavorful, the service is timely, and the staff is always extremely friendly and attentive. Plus it's very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Awesome margaritas (Coyote) and the food was delicious. Order the Mexican chicken chimichanga with Jalape√±o cream cheese on it - it was huge and delicious. Really good Mexican rice and their salsa is tasty. Service was great, as well!"}
{"text":"Though the food was delicious, this review is primarily for their excellent service.   A few weeks back, we celebrated a special 50th birthday for my brother-in-law at Rio Mirage. Every waitstaff that we encountered was very friendly and helpful with extra props to Ramon, our head server. They allowed us to decorate our tables in addition to the front entrance area.  They also offered to put a special birthday message on their blackboard for us.  When Ramon realized that we didn't bring balloons, he found some in storage, blew them up and had them ready for the birthday boy's arrival.  That evening, we had a party of 16 which also included small children and it went off without a hitch. Ramon made sure the whole evening went smoothly. He welcomed organized chaos and was always around making sure everyone's drinks were filled and the food was up to par.  They even went above and beyond and served the cake and ice cream we brought in.  Thanks Ramon and team!!    The whole experience was fantastic.  If you want to have a large dinner party at a fun and friendly place, then this is your place.  We will definitely go back whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good stuff about this place, Mother's Day brunch was awesome. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Our family loves this restaurant and eat there often.  This new building is beautiful, but the booths are terribly uncomfortable.  The service is hit or miss...been more misses than hits lately.  I only gave three stars because of the service. The food is consistently good and well prepared.  Their salsa is good (not great) and the hot sauce is HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"I have been going back to Rio Mirage once again, management got  a hold of me. We were able to discuss the situation. Again, I was never asking for anything! Food and service were never an issue. We discussed the problem, management gave me an reason, and everything is fine. Rachel admitted there is a problem with their website and getting her messages off the website is not the easiest way. The only reason why she knew there was an problem, was reading my review on yelp! Once she knew there was an issue, she messaged me right away! I could accept that, and will move on! Rio Mirage can expect me there once a week again! Glad to be back!"}
{"text":"Prompt, curteous service. Clean booths and table. Delicious chips, salsa...not so much. I had the three combo meal...two chicken tacos and a cheese enchilada. It was ok. Not a lot of flavor and the chicken meat was in HUGE pieces. I had to cut the chicken with a knife to eat it!  Honestly, I won't be going back. There is one Mexican establishment that's been in the valley for over 50 years...and that's where I will continue to go when the craving for Mexican hits!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Nothing I write can truly convey what a terribly run restaurant with less than helpful staff this place really is. We waited 20mins to be seated, after waiting another 10mins our waiter finally came over by this time we were ready to order and did so. 30mins had passed and the tables around us who were seated way after us were getting their meals. I flagged our waiter down and asked how much longer it would be and he said he forgot to put in our order but would give us a complimentary desert. He said he was really busy and would get a manager if I wanted. I was absolutely stunned I thought it was a joke. The manager was equally unhelpful and lazy. This was a terrible experience. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Excellent. We eat here almost every weekend. Simple reasons...  The food is WONDERFUL. Like most mexican food places, the plates are huge and the food is scaulding hot when it arrives, but the food seems to be a notch above most places we have eaten.  The drinks are abundant and you can order everything from small margaritas to SUPER HUGE get-you-drunk FAST margaritas. I am a White Russian enthusiast, and they have one of the best I have ever had.  The wait service is prompt and polite. The management is great. This guy made me a White Russian with half and half instead of milk and it was the best thing ever! Now every time we go back the manager makes me my drink:) Incredible customer care.  I disagree with previous comments about the Guacamole. Its alive and tasty. We order a side of it with our chips and salsa every time we visit.  I would HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went into Rio Mirage for the first time last night and I can tell you I will be going back again! Two friends and I sat at the bar and had the pleasure of interacting with the bartender. The drinks were awesome and he was very friendly! Then we ordered dinner. Oh my God! I had the bandarillas de camaron and it was amazing. The shrimp was great and the vegetables were perfect. The menu doesn't tell you that there are mushrooms in it and they were awesome as well."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food has always been really good.  The service has always been a bit slow and not very personable."}
{"text":"Best service on planet. JC is an amazing bartender and server. He truly has eyes and ears in the back of his head and can hear your order from tables away!"}
{"text":"I now it's mainly white folks who come out for Cinco but my sister ended up getting the day off and we were hungry, so we started our journey and headed out west! It was about 4:30 when we arrived the parking lot was full I had to park in the next vacant lot but it was because of the party tent's so no biggie. We got seated right away in a nice comfy booth. I love the decor lots of colors not too abnoxious with beautifully painted murals in key places even in the restroom. Restroom had nice stalls with real wood slatted doors you wont have to worry about kids playing peekaboo w/u under the stalls.   Our waiter was really polite and served us very well.  The chip's were really good not greasy or salty + The salsa was super fresh not really spicey (I am Mexican) with a good mixture of cilantro but its like in Sun City so I understand, they brought it out in a carafe which I love but it should still come in a small bowl as well. Trying to get the salsa from a flat plate on to your chips can get frusterating we found ourselves pouring it right on to the chip instead. Was it supposed to come w a bowl maybe, could we have asked for one...probably?!? It was happy hour and we were too excited over the $1 drafts which included Blue Moon you cant beat that. We ordered the guac as an appetizer it came plated nice with diff bigger chips see pic. The guac lacked heat and taste a bit I coudnt detect any limon or cilantro =( so we ended up mixing it w the salsa and ate it that way.   I ordered their  #5 which is a Chile Relleno w a green corn tamale came w beans and rice. The hot plates came out the cheeses were still bubbling. The tamale was GINORMOUS it was as big as my sister's chimi. The tamale was my fav it was moist and the corn was sweet mmm. The rice and beans were excellent the rice was cooked perfectly you could tell it was really fresh again. The chile relleno was pretty good the cheese was all melty but again no real heat.   After getting the bill we proceeded to finish our beers and moved slowly to the party tent. We decided to hang out to avoid the traffic. There was a band that was awesome not only did they play spanish cumbias and some oldies but they played some No Doubt. They had girl dancers/singers. By the end of the night we ended up dancing all in all we had a great time! It was a perfect Cinco specal thanks to Sauza ;)"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  A bit expensive. $7 for a bowl of tortilla soup.  The Mahi Mahi was the only grilled fish on the menu and it was over-done.  The sides were ok."}
{"text":"First of all I know I am young but I have an sophisticated palate when it comes to food and this place is awful I would not recommend this to anyone. The benches were awful it felt like the springs gave out. I came here with my grandparents and I ordered the Burrito De Fajita and I was not impressed by the chicken. It was so dry and crunchy.The carmelized onions were so bland It tasted like air.  The sour cream was thick and hard. My grandpa had the mahi mahi and it was not supposed to be hot and and it burned even my mouth. The best part of the meal was atleast the waiter was nice and he got our drinks fast. But overall I am not ever planning on coming back here again. I am sorry for all the people that come here."}
{"text":"2pm on Cinco de Mayo.  Wrong day to go, right?  30 minute wait, they said.  But we were lucky - two chairs opened at the 4 chair bar and we took them.  And watched the bartender in amazement as he made drinks, washed glasses, took orders at the tables in the bar room, took payments and a million other things.  He even served us our food. Wow!  And the food was good.  We had steak fajitas and they were really good.  Wish they used a insulated box to keep the tortillas warm, tho.  The Gold Cadillacs were excellent.  We'll go again, for sure.  If they can do that well on May 5th, can you imagine.........."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican restaurant I have been to in a while.   I recommend the jalapeno toritos (if you like hot).  The salsa was amazing and the service was spot on.  It was mildly busy when we visited but i see why this place is always packed."}
{"text":"We came in from California to visit family and we were looking for a spot to eat. This place popped up on yelp. Yummy! Will be back next time we come through! Great portions we all took food home! Great service too."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for almost 5 years.  It is our favorite.  We always get great food consistently, every time.  The service is second to none, they are so attentive and are so friendly.  Tonight, the carne machaca dinner was excellent.  The hand made tortillas are super good.  They never disappoint!!  Its our regular place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Our go to Mexican restaurant!  Chips and salsa are great, their salsa has a tinge of sweet to it. Hands down love the steak rolled quesadilla!  The steak is super tender and the whole thing is yummy!  It used to be an appetizer but now a main entree.  If we are not too hungry the hubby and I split it.  Alas I have never ordered something that was bad. They have a great house margarita and if you are feeling saucy the Cadillac margarita gets a thumbs up!  Don't forget a cinnamint on the way out !"}
{"text":"A little disappointing since we were told this was a great place for Mexican food. The salsa was very bland with the extra thin chips. Our beers came very slowly, the frosted glass was melted. I had the Mahi mahi tacos. The tortillas were good, like homemade. The fish was nicely seasoned and grilled but the pineapple salsa and black beans were blah. The decor was pleasant but we'll  keep looking for authentic Mexican ."}
{"text":"The typical Mexican food choices. Nothing unusual here. They do have margaritas for $.99 happy hour price.   The service was good. The margaritas were OK. But you are in an area not known for great restaurants.   I'd look for something more authentic next time. I'm sure there are MANY in this area."}
{"text":"1st time here. I had the Fajita Steak Specialty Burrito DEEP FRIED!!! with jalapeno cream sauce!! My Wife had the Chicken Fajitas. NEVER had a deep fried burrito and it was off the hook!! Plenty of steak throughout and the deep fried tortilla was amazing. My wife's Chicken Fajita's had huge slices of charbroiled chicken and it was quite simply amazing. Excellent prices, very quiet at lunch time and excellent service.  Now, our very favorite Mexican restaurant.  Update : Dropped one star  Came here a second time and brought family as I hyped up the deep fried burrito so much. 2 of us ordered fajita steak and 1 ordered chicken. Wow what a turn around. My burrito had a slab of carne asada in it. A slab, not cut up steak, just one chunk of gristle packed meat. It was disgusting. I asked the waitress what sort of meat was in it. She said it was carne' asada, We both left our burritos' there, however the chicken burrito was excellent. It is possible that I said steak burrito instead of Fajita which would certainly be my fault however this would not be suitable as a steak burrito either."}
{"text":"I'm always pleased with the service. The food is delicious pretty consistent. I enjoy the atmosphere! Give it a try! (I tried the one on Grand Avenue in El Mirage I didn't care for it so much the food taste really different than the one on Bell Road... I will stick to my Bell Road location)"}
{"text":"Intro- I really love this place!  PROS- Nice food, authentic cuisine, Perfect decorations, friendly service. What more could I ask for? First visit, I was seated. I got chips and salsa for free, the chips were hot and the salsa was spicy, just the way I like it! I got an iced tea, and Albondigas, Grandmother got a tea and Ensalada Grande. It was great! Then at the end we got pumpkin flan, which was very nice!  CONS- Just a little 2 pricey for my grandmothers taste.  CONCLUSION- This place is great, just be careful of what you spend. Kids are welcomed and adored here. Staff are friendly and if you know Spanish you are most likely to get into a 15-minute conversation :)"}
{"text":"This place was really neat! Has a great Latin themed atmosphere. I really love the bar area! Makes you feel like your in a small dive bar in Mexico. I can't get over the how cool it felt!   The staff here are beyond great at what they do when it comes to customer service. I felt very welcomed as I was greeted at the door and when I left.   I came here with a co-worker, who is a regular here. We ordered drinks and ordered food for lunch. We started with a couple draft beers (bud-light). The beer is served in a frosty cold glass, and you and feel a hint of ice crisp when you take the first couple gulps. Very awesome!! For food I ordered the shredded chicken burrito enchilada style with red sauce, also asked them to out the guacamole and sour cream on the inside of the burrito. Let me tell ya! This little concoction was absolutely delicious!   Everything about this place was good. From the greeting at the door, to the chips and salsa, to the beer, to the cohesion of staff and customers. I will very much so be back for another visit very soon!   Great job guys and girls."}
{"text":"Good for this type of Mexican restaurant (similar to an El Torito chain). We had the Rico  burrito, enchilada/ taco combo. Both good. Chips, salsa, guacamole very good and fresh. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in the west valley! Great food and great service. Very authentic and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"They have pretty decent and authentic Mexican food. Pretty large menu so lots of options. I bit on the pricey side, but they make up for it by having 99 cent margaritas on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Fun place to go with family/friends. Big portions for reasonable price. They have 99 cent margaritas that are awesome."}
{"text":"The food was good, nothing to get excited about but good, nice looking,  very decorative atmosphere."}
{"text":"Mom wanted Mexican food for her birthday and that's what she was getting. Of course, this yelper broke out the list of all the great Mexican joints I have been to or wanted to go to but I was overruled. After picking her up she directed me to Rio Mirage Caf√©, a place right down the street from her house and a spot she really likes. Upon arrival, the outside and inside looked inviting.  I must admit, some places my mother picks are suspect but this place was a nice joint. For the grub, we started with chips and salsa that were provided and also the flaming toritos. The chips were average at best but the salsa was very good. I do believe I knocked out two orders of salsa by myself.  The flaming toritos were very good as well. They provided a lot of heat for this white guy and the dipping sauce was cool and refreshing. Given the amount of salsa I consumed, I tried to stick with a healthier entr√©e option in having the mahi mahi tacos. Sadly, they missed the mark for me. The corn tortilla was not good and the mahi was very dry. The beans and rice that came with the dish were good though and saved the dish from being real bad. Since it was mom's special day, the great staff sang her a nice birthday song and provided some refried ice cream. The ice cream did not have the typical frosted flakes crust I was use to but I did enjoy the dish.  We also ordered a round of their sopapillas to finish off a night of unhealthy eating and I really enjoyed them. They were a little doughy but I think that is why I enjoyed them so much. As mentioned prior, staff was great. Our main waiter (sorry forgot his name) had a great sense of humor and was very attentive. Overall, a nice night out with family and a place I would stop by again."}
{"text":"What happened!? This restaurant was our 'go to' for a good night out. Not so tonight. The service was ok, but the black beans had a bad 'plastic' taste,  they were inedible. When brought to the attention of the server she said she wouldn't know because she didn't like beans!? Oh well,  so many other restaurants to try in the atea, no loss."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend that lives in the area. We actually tried to go here Friday night at 6pm and it was a 1 hour wait. We came back on Saturday at 5pm and went right to the bar. We had a few drinks. If you order a Margarita it is pre made in a picture. They were ok nothing exciting. But the pomegranate margarita was so good. A must have. When sitting at the bar chips and salsa are $2 per order. I thought the salsa could have had more spice. I understand it is near Sun City so they tone it down for that group. But they give you a generous serving of salsa and a large basket of chips. We had the small appetizer platter and it was so good. I the dinner plates looked really really good but after a few drinks and all that chips and salsa the appetizer platter was perfect. The decor is nice and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in the Surprise area.  Large portions great seasoning enough in one order for two.  Our favorite is ther fajitas which contains a full half pound of meet.  Don't miss this place"}
{"text":"Not.overly impressed. Smallest bowl of salsa saved with bowl of chips. Ordered a cheese crisp with black olives green chili's and tomatoes. Really not much flavor. Bar was filthy. Floor in restaurant was filthy."}
{"text":"Sad to say I really did not enjoy this restaurant. I was very surprised that what I thought was a family run Mexican restaurant served bottled salsa with chips. The chips tasted store bought and the salsa was served on a plate, making it difficult to eat at all. That was not a good start.   The food just has a very \"frozen foodish\" quality to me. I want my Mexican food fresh and flavorful. This just didn't do it for me. But then I really don't like Macayos either - so if you like Macayos you may like this. It's not for me at all. I won't be back."}
{"text":"So I was in Surprise for a very short visit to sort things out at my mom's so she could rent her home. After two days of intense organizing and cleaning, I was ready for my reward, some quality Mexican food.  My mother pointed me toward Rio Mirage. I ordered tortilla soup and carne asada for us to take out and share. The staff was extremely polite when I arrived and promptly gave me my order. When I arrived back at mom's, (a seven minute drive), the soup was hot, but the entire carne Assad meal including rice and beans was ice cold as if it was taken out of the fridge and handed to me. I was just plain too exhausted to drive the food back, but I did call and tell the manager what had happened. I wasn't asking for anything, and I told him so, but he insisted on refunding my order since that was not how they ran their business.  I graciously thanked him. It will be a week, Wed. Night, and I have not received any refund. Now I want it, just on principal. For the record, the carne asada is in the trash."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it was just ok. The last time I went it was horrible. It was a slow night and they sit us all the way in the back, the table was so short after we were done bumping are legs into the table getting in the booth the table is right on your lap, we asked to be moved and we got a table an inch higher. The food was substandard. The service was non existent. I prefer the old Rio Mirage for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We can't get enough of it. The chips and salsa are the best in town. I always order the combination 12 and my husband tries something new every time. We have never had something we didn't like. The traditional margaritas are perfect between sour and sweet and the environment is really fun. This is the best Mexican food we have had besides what you can find in Mexico and even then, Rio Mirage is still better than most places. If you ever want to try a New Mexican food place, don't hesitate to go to Rio Mirage."}
{"text":"I'm from California, so finding Mexican food that tastes like the Mexican food as good as the restaurants back home was the best thing ever! The staff is really sweet and they are really quick to refill drinks . For sure recommend trying this place out. OH!!! And you can't forget about how good the chips and salsa are!"}
{"text":"Meh. This place was just okay. Service took their time getting to us. The price was not what I expected for what we got. Over priced everything. Sorry. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Don't go here ... Ridiculous! So We call ahead two hours and are told no we don't need a reservation for 6 people.   Yet we arrive and are told it's a 60 min wait with no reservation and then also it's Because they have a party of 34 people ahead of us and we didn't call 24 hours in advance.   Pretty sure you have more than seating for 34 people and staff to accommodate that large party .   The Manger Veronica has no idea why the phone system lets you call and make a reservation because that's only for 8 or more yet it does not say that on the recording.   Then you have the snotty girl at the front counter named tresenia who is so rude telling us we need a days notice to have a simple Mexican food meal, this isn't Ruth chris princess.   Used to frequent this place however they new staff have turned this place to shit ."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the food here. We had machaca chimis and tortilla soup. The service was a little slow for not having very many people but I would go again to eat and maybe have a drink or two"}
{"text":"Friendly  staff. The food  was good .  Big servings  good  flavors .  The salsa  was not hot. Crispy  tortillas  chips . Best  jumbo shrimp ."}
{"text":"Cool, needs some updating. We also smelled like grease after we left the establishment.  Food is good and service was great."}
{"text":"We have eaten here three times.  The food is good, but the management and service of the place leaves a lot to be desired. First time, we arrived at 5 PM and it was VERY crowded in the entrance and outside.  We waited about 25 minutes to be seated.  So the next time we came, we arrived at 2 PM for a late lunch.  No crowd, good food.  Slow service, but that is the way this place is.  Third time we ate there we arrived at 4 PM thinking we would beat the rush.  No one was waiting except us.  But they couldn't seat us for \"5 minutes\", they said,  because they were doing a \"shift change\".  No problem, we stood there waiting for 10 minutes as 6 workers tried to figure out how to take a man's carryout order.  Then they decided to write down our name on a list and more waiting.  We were told to sit in the bar to wait.  We did that until other workers told us we couldn't wait there unless we ordered dinner in the bar!  Twenty-five minutes later the entrance was completely filled with people waiting and we were finally seated.  But it didn't end there.  We waited at the table for 20 more minutes and didn't see a waitress until we stopped the hostess and REQUESTED one!    The moral of this story is never arrive at 4 PM.  The food is good, not exceptional.  Is it worth the wait?  Nope."}
{"text":"Have gone to Rio Mirage Cafe serveral times hoping their customer service would improve. The food is good, but the male servers talk fast and are in a hurry. They (often) get the food order wrong and I have to get up and find the server to get service. Won't be back soon."}
{"text":"The El Rico Burrito is fantastic! Although it says it is deep fried, you can order it non-fried. Excellent friendly service, and overall great food."}
{"text":"Try the tortilla soup! So delicious. Also, great steal fajitas. I mostly come here for the soup though."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. Great service as well. Highly recommend. I had the enchiladas, which were wonderful."}
{"text":"Great tasting meal.  Clean restaurant with very friendly waitress who was attentive to our needs. No complaints from me except it was a bit pricey.  I got the rolled quesadillas and they were yummy with a large portion.  My son also ordered that but with fajita meat so his was more expensive.  We both ended up taking some home. Little one got the chicken nuggets and there were plenty for him along with fries.  My husband got tacos with rice and beans and he couldn't finish his.  However, with tip, I left $71 poorer.  I'd recommend this place as long as you know \"it ain't cheap.\""}
{"text":"We arrived at 7:45 pm and it said it closed at 9pm. We at in the bar and watched another couple arrive 10 minutes later and the bartender told them they were closed and the sign was wrong.He kept looking at his watch like we were holding him up.  The bar tender seemed pretty clueless, first asking me if I wanted a cadillac margarita than telling me they were out of the stuff to make it. We asked if there was carnitas on the menu and he looked very confused and said they just got it in, but not the night menu. What kind of mexican place doesn't  serve carnitas at night? To top it off we were given the wrong bill at the end of the night . This bill had our drinks mixed with another tables food. Over charging us by almost $15.  Over all the service was very bad, the food was ok. But we won't be back."}
{"text":"We will ALWAYS stop at Rio Mirage Cafe when visiting from Colorado. Veronica and her staff go above and beyond every single time we go. The food is delicious and the prices match the portions and the quality. a MUST for this traveling family."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Great Chips and Fresh salsa! Service is OK...nothing special, nothing bad. Their margaritas are much better than Las Fuentes. Rio Mirage know cocktails are about proportion and consistency. Even their Tuesday $.99 margaritas are good. I had Rico's special burrito with chicken....FANTASTIC!!!! It's loaded with flavor. Great variety of ingredients. This is a great alternative to nasty Las Fuentes. The atmosphere, drinks, service, and food....EAT HERE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Rio Mirage on bell in surprise az is a horrible place...big fat 0 (zero) never eat here...worst service ever!!! They sat us and no one came at all (for 15 minutes and restaurant was pretty much empty at noon, shoulf have been my first clue) ...they sat 2 other groups and two waiters came right out...so we left but the whole time I was telling them we were their first and they ignored us...manager ingnored us...went back in and demanded an apology and they just stared at me. Will never go back...and will make sure everyone I know, knows never to go their either."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this restaurant hands down best Mexican restaurant in Surprise! The waiter was outstanding and very friendly. Chips and salsa always delicious. My wife and I had the tacos Mexicano with chicken and I had the steak, both had great flavor; rice and beans perfect. Definitely recommend this restaurant for locals or anyone in town looking for great Mexican food. $67"}
{"text":"I want to give this place 4 stars, but I just can't.   What I like:  1. The service is always friendly and quick. 2. The food is not remarkable, but dependable and tastes pretty good. 3. It's local, and the prices are reasonable.    What I don't really like:  1. What is with the horribly planned foyer? If waiting indoors for a table, you either have to stand in front of the entrance, and move every 2 seconds for people entering and exiting, or stand in front of the bathroom, and move every 2 seconds... or stand near the host podium, and try to not stare at people who are already dining. We ended up waiting outside. The heat was preferable to the crowding.  2. The booths are sunken-in but high up. I feel like Edith Ann, with my feet dangling above the ground. Not comfy!  3. Why are some of the dishes kind of bland, like the enchiladas? They're ok but nothing to write home about. Spice it up a bit, and the surprisingly big crowd here will get bigger.   Until then... 3 stars."}
{"text":"We decided to have Mexican food and have seen this place many times but tonight was our first time stopping in.  The environment when we walked in was very much Mexican in its decor and I got a warm feeling when I saw how cosy the seats were and how there was a lot of privacy from table to table. Great atmosphere at this point.  The wait was about a 15 minute wait and we were promptly seated. We ordered our drinks. The wait was a bit longer than I had planned but we were okay. When the waitress gave us our drinks, it took quite some time before she came back to take our order. In fact, a woman behind me asked a waitress if she could take her order which was a clear sign she waited for a while too.  When we took our order the food came out in a pretty reasonable time frame and I have to say the food was amazing. We got some chimichangas and burritos and wow was the food tasty. So although we had a few hiccups with the waiting, the food quality and atmosphere made up for it.  I will go back again!"}
{"text":"Carolina and JC are the best, I've always had great drinks made by them. Great food, I love the tacos Mexicanos and the el Rico! If you want something amazing order the el Rico burrito. Great service and friendly staff. I take my family and friends here from time to time, and they love it."}
{"text":"First time here, looking for something different, the food was excellent, great chips and salsa, I had the El Rico burrito, my GF had the green chili plate, both were very good, no complaints, nice atmosphere & great location in Surprise, we will go again & try other dishes, the tortillas are handmade by them, our server Benjamin was excellent! I would recommend for good Mexican food, margaritas looked good, but we didn't order any that night. Bill was 33.00 for two of us."}
{"text":"Had combo with cheese enchilada and taco!! Taco was small and cheese enchilada was most horrible! No cheese in or on it!! Tasted like out of can!! Was not even hot!! Not worth the money!! Will never go back! First time there! Service was lukewarm to say the least!"}
{"text":"Started with the beef  nachos and hands down some of the best I've tried.   All four meals were excellent and the cheese enchiladas are simple and tasty, no accompaniment needed.   Waiter was fun and funny, not to mention he and the team did a great job keeping the drinks full and the chips, the salsa and food coming.   Best meal we've had in a long time - thank you!"}
{"text":"Delish from start to finish -- zesty salsa, not-to-salty chips, perfectly cooked prawns, hot tortillas, & fine margaritas.  Dinged one star because we all asked for no salt & ALL got salt, and the specials menu on the table was sticky."}
{"text":"Rio Mirage is an excellent restaurant for lunch.  The lunch specials cannot be beat.  For only $7, you get a piping hot dish that's not only plentiful, but also delicious.  The area is clean, the waiters are attentive and quick, and parking is available.  The food is more traditional than what you'll obtain at a fast food burrito area.  I prefer Rio Mirage over a lot of the other Mexican restaurants in this area, and the quality, authenticity, and service easily gives me a reason to return again and again.  There is hope for them to not change chefs or staff.  They are doing an amazing job."}
{"text":"An ok place for a Mexican meal.  The food was ok.  Store bought chips.  Interesting Rico Burrito with the usual ingredients and mushrooms and pablano peppers.  There was a wait on a Wednesday night.  Ok bar."}
{"text":"Portions are huge and staff is very friendly.   My margarita on the rocks was excellent.   Next time in town a must"}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is fast and friendly! When I'm in the mood for good mexican food this is the first place I come to."}
{"text":"Nothing too fancy as far as food. I share the shrimp fajatas not a bad portion but no flavor. I've had the burritos which are much better."}
{"text":"Gary M.   This place is really good.  The food is excellent, the service is outstanding.  What I DIDN'T like here was that the menu does not have the prices of their drinks.  So after searching for it, I had to ask the waitress who came back and told me what a margarita cost.  They are good but very expensive and I think it is wrong to expect people to just order drinks with dinner, wine, beer or whatever and not know how much they cost from looking at the menu.  Seems a bit devious to me.  So I only rate them a three stars."}
{"text":"Great flavor, fantastic customer service!!!! Also, huge portion sizes my husband and I shared an appetizer and a main entree and it lasted us for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were excellent. Wife and I both had fish tacos , and they were great as well. Very reasonably priced, and the margaritas were tasty too. I had the standard blended with salt and wife had a strawberry one that she said was good too. We were on vacation in phx of the holiday and wanted some good Mexican....go you won't be disappointed. Service was excellent too!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!! The pollo especial is delicious! Servers are always nice & attentive. I highly recommend this location over the El Mirage one."}
{"text":"Wow. What a find. This is the best Mexican food in the valley, trust me, we've tried them all. The chips and salsa are so good we weren't hungry for our meal but we forged on. My husband had the shrimp cocktail. Amazing. I had spinach enchiladas. Amazing. Margaritas. Amazing. Service. Amazing. Sopapillas. Amazing. Churros. Amazing. Need I say more??? You won't regret a meal at this place!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place.  We went on a busy Friday evening and we were seated fairly quick.  Our server was decent...that was about the extent of the good.  The salsa with the chips was ok but nothing special.   I wouldn't recommend the Carne Asada plate.  The meat was bland and had no flavor."}
{"text":"Pros. Great main dish (chimichangas!). Huge flavorful margheritas. Cons. Asked not to be sat next to the toilet. Was sat next to the toilet. Asked for queso, not given queso. Asked for limes, got lemons. Asked for churros, got over-cooked rope."}
{"text":"Ok i have to say this! If my Jesus came back tonight! Im glad this was my last meal on earth!! From the time we walked in it was a very pleasant. The staff was very friendly an kept checking on us. Even the manager came over. Veronica was our waitress an she is awesome!! The chips an salsa was very good to start with. Never been here so was told the \"El Rico\" was good. (They lied) it was one of the most delicious burritos i ever had!! It came with rice of course an beans with cheese. Usually i just leave that on the plate, but it looked good an omg it was good!! My wife had the same thing. She got to try the prickly pear margarita. She said it was real good an had two!! I just had a coke cause i had to drive. An also had the caramel churros with vanilla ice cream. IM STILL SO FULL!! I cant see anyone giving less than 5 stars here. If so yall just having a bad day an need to go to sleep an wake up an try AGAIN!! This is my new spot! Wanna try almost everything on their menu!! Hope this helps!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in Surprise.  We have tried nearly everything on the menu and have been going for years. The service is great. There is always a wait because it's so good. Great atmosphere for a date night or a weekend dinner. The margaritas... are so gooood!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Real authentic Mexican food. However, would not recommend the margaritas unfortunately. Nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! I'm a Mexican food fanatic and my family and I frequent here a lot. I LOVE the Jalape√±o Toritos (grilled jalape√±os, stuffed with cream cheese, and wrapped in bacon OH LORD HAVE MERCY ON MY SOUL ITS DELICIOUS) but warning, they are SPICY! I love spicy food too. It's my favorite but even for me these things will bite you. I make them all the time at home and I usually take all the seeds out so they aren't over whelming spicy so maybe they leave the seeds in but I really don't know, the cooks know more then I do lol but other then that everything is amazing and the service is top notch. Plus they did a wonderful job embarrassing my little brother with me for his birthday!"}
{"text":"We tried it based on meeting Stephanie and her husband at dinner one night! Their comments were all true upon completing our meal. Saturday dinner for 3, cocktails which were excellent Cadillac Margaritas, followed by pollo chimichanga and grilled shrimp fajitas. Server in bar was excellent, Isidro was our server and all exceeded our expectations! Thank you Stephanie for the suggestion to visitors from California!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food!  I'm from the Midwest, and I love authentic Mexican!  This place is always a must stop and eat!! My husband lives the El Tico!"}
{"text":"We have been to the Surprise Rio Mirage a few times and it's been ok however today it was great!!! Great service from Jose and the good was tasty.  I had the Rico and my husband has a steak fajita burrito and we both were much more impressed over other visits.  Keep up the good work cuz we will be back."}
{"text":"This place was great! I was in the mood for good hearty Mexican food and went based on reviews.  I got chicken fajitas. They were fresh and sizzling. The chips are crispy and thin... not to heavy. Salsa had a kick and not to chunky.  Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to AZ from MN and we've been trying to find a good Mexican restaurant. We don't have to look any further the food, service and atmosphere were amazing! We ordered chicken, steak and shrimp fajitas and a Rio Mirage El Rico specialty burrito and fried ice cream for dessert. We loved everything and highly recommend both dishes. The service was on point, they were super busy but our waitress made sure our waters were always full. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has wonderful food in a colorful and comfortable environment. The staff is terrific. We came in for lunch with a large group from our Spanish class, reserving tables in advance. They accommodated us nicely, delivering delicious food and tasty drinks. What a friendly place. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! My husband and I were tired of only have macayos as our go to for Mexican food, I read all the reviews on here and figured we should give it a shot! Definitely worth the $$ staff was very nice and the food was crazy good!"}
{"text":"There are many mexican spots in Arizona and I'm excited that this place is right down the street from us.  The service has always been good, and the food, amazing!  We have had a variety of dishes and haven't had a bad thing yet.  One little secret we learned is if you want hot salsa, ask for the habenero sauce and mix it in with the regular salsa.  Make sure you have water on hand because it is spicy!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant several months ago, enjoyed it, and have been back many times since.  My wife and I usually get a traditional margarita, as they taste fresh and are delicious.  We have eaten quite a variety from their menu, at both lunch and dinner.  The multiple distinct flavors and evident clear quality never fail to impress us.  We always ask for the same server, Ramon, and his pleasant and enjoyable demeanor always adds to our experience.  Great place, and always look forward to returning."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Rio Mirage. The food here is huge portions and so good. The service however is what keeps us coming back, the staff if very attentive and you never have to search for your waitress or be over bombarded by them either."}
{"text":"It's tough to find good Mexican food in Sun City/Surprise/Peoria but this is probably the best in the area.  Chips are always warm and salsa is reasonably flavorful. Ask for habanero specialty salsa to kick it up a nacho. Shrimp dishes seem to be a great choice, but I enjoy the combo with tostada, cheese enchilada and relleno with Christmas sauce. Tons of food to keep you up all night.  Whoa! Wednesday is 99 cent margs that are worth the buck."}
{"text":"I am VERY underwhelmed!!!   Had dinner at Rio Mirage tonight with a friend. First of all, I ask for pico de gallo. (I live in Seattle now, and, NOBODY there charges for it. I am a 30 year Arizonan.) This joint wants $ 1.00 for a little tiny fried tortilla of it. I tell the server to forget it....I'm not paying. \"The manager makes us charge for everything\", she says. I tell her I don't want it. She talks to the manager and he/she gives their mighty approval to waive the fee. Normally I don't balk about 1.00, but, really? This is a Mexican joint....you offer different salsas, right? You HAVE it in the kitchen, because it's later ON my food! Anyway. Onward and upward....or so we hoped!   Second issue....my friend gets a combo dinner. She wants to swap out one item and the server says, \"That is fine, as long as both items are on ANY of the combo meals.\" My friend says, \"The MANAGER isn't going to charge me, right?\" and all we laugh. (Not realizing later, we'd not be laughing anymore.) She says, \"No, it's no charge.\" Later, after the meal, she brings the check...guess what? We get charged 1.00, which SHE claims is because of my friend making a substitution! WHAT? She said, \"No problem, you can switch items as long as both items are in combos.\" Well, they both were, and, there....as pretty as a picture is $1.00 charge.   We pay the check, leave our digbat server a crappy tip. SHE can pay for the pico de gallo or the combo change around.   Aside from those rediculous happenings, the food was VERY sub-par for Arizona. I would never eat there again and I live in the northwest and KNOW bad Mexican food at this point. Even some up there is much better than this restaurant. My fajita burrito was tasteless. Even the sauce on it was very bland.   Save your money----go elsewhere, get a recommendation for a GOOD place to eat, because brotha....this ain't it !!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I , there was 8 of us, went in on a Friday night around 8:00, they close at 10:00. There was all but maybe a few customers. The place is usually packed.  First off, the hostesses are usually NOT the friendliest but we've been going there since 2007. We maybe go there like 5 times a yr. Secondly, they put us at a small old light colored table and the chairs were small ripped and old too. No Lie!!! The tables around us were the nice big dark ones with the nice big chairs. There was one other family in there and they were about to leave. We were the only ones in that part of the restaurant which is there main area. We thought do they close at 9?... Nope ...they close at 10:00 on a Friday night. Not that it would have mattered since it was 8:00. Then we had a small pitcher of water with our cups all stack up, which fine no biggy we just ask for more water. The chips took around 10 min to get to our table and only gave us 1 bowl which was half full even and one salsa for 8 people. We're like could we please have more. She seemed irritated...WTF!!! Nobody is here but us... Our waiter was friendly , that's why I gave this place 2 stars. Everyone had water ,except 3 of us had beer, which the glasses were warm but the beer was ok. The food was good as it usually is, but my soup was not!!! I got the tortilla soup, which is always good ,but Friday night they forgot to put in the chicken and stuff..lol.. it was just melted cheese soup with maybe a few chicken pieces and a few tortilla strips... ...I also had a taco too which was good. Everyone enjoyed there food but Wow!!!  Oh and as we were sitting ,at our crappy table, they're like 6 people cleaning, sweeping, and putting up chairs all around us like if it was around 10:00. I know your at a restaurant and they need to clean but come on....it was a bit much... we all felt like we were bothering them by being there. It was 8:00 and they close at 10:00. I think I'll take my family to the one on Grand. This place will never change. It's a hit and miss kind of place on the service or the food or both."}
{"text":"I just called Rio Mirage to order a take out and the girl said can I call you on from another phone because the one she was using had a low battery.  I waited for an hour and never got a call from her so I went to another Mexican restaurant and had excellent service.  Not only did I get good service but there were no mistakes on my order.  Another thing about Rio - they always mess up my order anyway.  I'm really done with ordering take out from Rio on Litchfield Rd."}
{"text":"Salsa and Guacamole are both delicious, hands down the best part!  I had the spinach enchiladas and they were great.  Note for vegetarians they do use lard in their refried beans so skip those.  My husband raved about his chicken fajita chimichanga, said it was fantastic.  The margaritas are not worth the price tag, but they are alright.  Service is ok, not quick but not bad, drinks stayed refilled, food came out perfectly hot and check was out when asked.  These days those things seem rare in the far west valley!"}
{"text":"Great meal! Go early on a weekend or go later! Dinner is a rush with the snowbirds here!"}
{"text":"I had Enchiladas Rancheros, and my wife had the Rio's Specialty Burrito.  Mine said it was supposed to come with rice and beans, but it had only beans, as did my wife's plate.  Huge chunks of beef and chicken breast in my enchiladas and in my wife's burrito.  Very tasty.  Excellent chips and salsa, and plenty of both.  Excellent house margaritas (blended and on-the-rocks).  Other than getting no rice, it was a place we'd return to (and probably will)."}
{"text":"Steak Chimichanga was delicious and so large, I shared my lunch.  Combination meals are also good.  I liked the chile rellenos.  $1 Margarita Day!!!  Love it!"}
{"text":"I have nothing fabulous to say about this place. Greeters were friendly when we walked in, waited a while for our server after being seated in an empty area. Expected chips and salsa but had to ask for it after we ordered. We ordered two cheese crisps and a lunch special of a Chicken Flauta, rice and beans. The best part of the meal was the chips and salsa after having to alter the recipe with lemon and their hot sauce to give it flavor. Otherwise their food was lacking of spices. This was our first time coming here and will be our last. At least the staff was friendly as we left.. I wish the food could have been just as good...."}
{"text":"Yummy fresh Mexican food.  I've been to each of the locations a few times and overall, it's good.  My only complaint is a personal preference, I don't like the taste of bacon with the black beans.  Again, this is my taste whereas someone else might prefer it.  Everything else has been awesome and so, I recommend anything on their menu, except the side of black beans."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Food was decent.  Atmosphere was good.  Margaritas weren't very good.   I'd go again, just not anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in the area for Mexican food. The staff is always warm and friendly, we feel like family. Every dish we have had has always been very good. The margaritas are always wonderful. We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service! JJ is the best! The #11 combo rules and the taco salad the wife loves."}
{"text":"My wife & I have eaten here several times and the food & service have always been excellent. Their Sunday buffet is wonderful! Their enchiladas are filled with lots of meat or cheese and the sauce is great!"}
{"text":"I came here visiting my grandmother in sun city west, the food was excellent but the service was a pinch slow. It just seemed like a slow day, there weren't many people around. My grandmother ordered a bland dish, because she was scared of the spice and didn't like, however I ordered the enchilada with the tamale and it was excellent and she enjoyed it as well. We also had the fried ice cream and churros. This seems like a good family restaurant with good food, and great desserts!"}
{"text":"Very tasty.  I recommend this location over the one nearby with a similar name, because I got enough to eat here... I don't like leaving a restaurant feeling hungry, and I had enough food from a combo plate and the chips & salsa.   A lot of effort has been put into making this location colorful and inviting.  Even the womens' restroom is cheerful, pretty and clean."}
{"text":"It's literally gotten better each time we have went. My wife is obsessed with the coyote Margarita, she has had it at many other locations but it never hits the spot like the one they make here. The el bombero is delicious and so is the Carne Asada plate. You cant go wrong with the shredded beef chimi with enchilada suace either. Take your family and thank me later."}
{"text":"I have been to this particular location about 5 times and I have finally narrowed down their best.  The El Rico is the best!  It is an easy 5 stars.  Everything else there ranges from 2.75 to 4 stars.  The staff are always friendly and they had a singer that had an acoustic guitar that would sing for everyone.  He was cool but I haven't seen him in a while.  I absolutely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good Mexican foot. Spinach Chicken Enchilada was especially good ($12.50). Went on a Sunday at ~11:45 AM and beat the crowd, as we had no wait. Enjoyed the guitar player."}
{"text":"Iv'e been here about 10 times now and there food is always consistently delicious.  Marinated Steak, Steak Fajitas & Asada Plate, all Great!  The Salsa is always fresh! The Draft Beers are always cold! The restaurant is always clean with a great atmosphere! The service is always friendly! Thanks Valerie"}
{"text":"Brought some family out of town to this spot for the 1st time. I have to say the food is pretty decent. The black beans were not the greatest. The service is extremely friendly but it was a little slower than what we were used to. If you are going to eat here, I suggest to not be in any hurry."}
{"text":"Extremely fast service, great chips and salsa. Good for a sit down mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"Rio Mirage is great!  It is one of our regular stops for lunch or dinner.   Good food that is always served piping hot. The best Salsa in the area. But most of all the service & servers are friendly, helpful & go above & beyond to make sure you have a positive dining experience.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went out to eat to celebrate Valentine's Day early. The food was delicious and hot. We have been searching for a great Mexican restaurant for some time now and this exceeded our expectations! Our service was great as well. Thank you Lily!"}
{"text":"The service was poor. We were seated at a table that did not have enough silverware and our server acted like we were a burden when we asked for small plates with our chips and salsa.  The good was the portions of the food. Very large portions so you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant it had great service.  They were always smiling very helpful. JJ was my server and he was not only polite and very funny always had a smile and was always making sure we were doing well.  The place was amazing and the chips and salsa are amazing.  It just kept coming. I would recommend this place if your look for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"My favorite place for enchiladas  I order the same thing every time I'm here, standing joke that I even look at the menu. Enchiladas! Paul loves the creme of poblano soup, winter only."}
{"text":"Just walked in 1 hour before close and three employees saw us waiting in the lobby and just walked away. No one even greeted us. It was just my wife and daughter. Guess we wont be eating here."}
{"text":"Good food, usually dependable service, and great Margaritas (especially on Wednesday).  This is one of our favorite spots."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here on New Years Eve.  When we walked up the decor is pretty much the same as any other mexican restaurant.  We got a table for 3 and were told the wait would be about 25 minutes so we headed to the bar for a drink.  The bar tender was a little stand offish as we told him we were only waiting for a table.  We asked for some chips and salsa while we waited and he said he couldnt give them to us because we were not eating at the bar.  I insisted that we would pay for them but he did not bring them.  Our table was ready in about 10 minutes.  The menu is pretty standard with a few variations here and there.    When we saw our waitress she was scatter brained and not sure what was going on.  We finally got our food and it was surprisingly good.  Our over all experience would have been better if our service was at a level that is to be expected when eating out.  I have spoken to friends who live in the area and they said the same thing.  \" Food is great, service blows\".  So if we ever eat here again it will be carry out only."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican place we've been to since moving to Az. Tastes authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"I went here with my coworker Jared......I don't think we will ever be back....  I have a hard time revisiting a place that has visible bugs?  I am sure all places have problems, but when you have to kill something to finish your meal its not on my list to revisit.  Food did not standout to me so I cannot recommend it, still have tingles down my spine thinking out creapy crawlers.  I think I will stay away and get my mexican grill somewhere else...."}
{"text":"This is not worth your time, AWFUL! This is americanized mexican food for the snowbirds-BLAH!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were on vacation and had another place in mind, but we came here after hearing great things about Rio Mirage. The guac was decent and our meals (mahi mahi tacos and spinach/chicken enchiladas) were okay, but kind of bland. We liked our margaritas but they were WEAK! We ordered mediums which were a pretty good size, but not strong at all. If we come back to Surprise, I'd rather go elsewhere. I think this may be a chain..."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, been here a couple times the food is decent but the management needs to get it together, constant customer service issues. Walk in told the computer system was down and it may take a little longer, was okay with that. Told 20min wait... we wait 30min to be told they are not serving any more food bc of the computer system. Mind you they were aware of this when we walked in... The manager didn't handle the situation but sent his hostess over."}
{"text":"Great service! They had a musician walking around to each table singing music while he played his guitar. He was friendly, too. The complimentary chips and salsa were tasty. I ordered the green chile chimichanga enchilada style (red or green sauce options), and I enjoyed it very much. The rice and beans are also very good. My girl ordered the fried fish tacos and liked them, only downfall was that the homemade corn tortillas were not warm enough."}
{"text":"Best Mexican cuisine in the area! I've tried many menu items, and they were all delicious...rolled quesadilla, guacamole, ensalada grande, pollo especial, carne escada, etc. everything was fresh and delivered to the table quickly.  The specialty margaritas are refreshing, flavorful, and unique. Great service every time, especially from the bartender, JC."}
{"text":"Ate there tonight and will not be returning. Service really slow took forever to get our tacos which were awful. They were soaked in grease could not eat the tortillas. Mentioned it to the waitress she really didn't care. My rice had bits of chicken in it wonder if it was leftover from another plate. Chips were also soaked in oil. Best thing on the menu was the iced tea!  Now that I am home I feel like I'm gonna be sick."}
{"text":"Here is my tip.   If you are in the area, don't be lazy and just drive the extra few miles to the El Mirage one.   I am sure they make a buck here having set up in the snowbird mecca intersection for 6 months out of the year.  But this place is terrible.  Night and day between here and El Mirage.   Staff is terrible, including managers/owners(?).  Sever was a jerk.  Food was greasy and disgusting.  The \"hot sauce\" I asked for instead of salsa came in a little plastic cup and looked like dishwater.  Chips were stale.  I could go on and on....and everything at the other location is exact opposite!  Stay away from this one."}
{"text":"YUK! This place has gone down hill like a sled! Terrible food prep, 0 flavor, incompetent front staff regarding seating!"}
{"text":"We came here once about a year ago and it was pretty good. We weren't blown away but it was a lot closer than our usual Mexican restaurant. A few months ago we came back in and it was terrible. We had nachos and split an entree. Everything was dry and burnt. You could tell the nachos had sat under a heat lamp. The cheese was rubbery and the ends of the chips were black. We mentioned it to the server and he apologized. We saw him maybe twice during the visit and he was bad about refilling our waters. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but the chips and taco shells are greasy and never crispy. The tamales are tasteless."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended and for good reason.  It is a standout in Mexican food...not you're typical Mexican.  So delicious and great service including the manager walking around and ensuring customers are doing well."}
{"text":"I probably have a more positive review than Stevey P. because I went in there with my 'nasty' radar turned up pretty high.  It's kind of like when you go to a movie expecting it to suck and when you get out of there you shrug your shoulders and think...well...it wasn't AS bad as I thought it would be.  I like to try new places just to mark them off my list and see for myself how it is.  So here's what I thought...  One of the differences I think was that we sat at a booth as opposed to the bar, so I can't say whether I would have liked my experience if I were at the bar.  While it was nice not to be ignored, the waitress was borderline over-attentive.  It's good to be attentive, but can be a little annoying if it's more than generally necessary.  She didn't seem to know much about the menu, but her saving grace was that she asked questions for us if she didn't know the answer instead of just dismissing us.  There's a pretty large menu of various dishes.  The appetizers weren't extremely appealing to me, and looked a little suspisciously like bar food.  Tried dishes: **Green Corn Tamale and Chile Relleno including beans and rice. The tamale was subtly sweet and extremely moist.  It was a pretty big size and probably one of the best Green Corn Tamales I've had in a long while.  However, if you don't like sweet tamales you won't like this one.  Fortunately, it was an excellent start to the meal for me. The Chile was oozing with creamy cheese and cooked just perfectly.  **Steak Fajitas with rice Really, it's kind of hard to mess up Fajitas.  But I will say the steak was cooked perfectly and had a great mesquite flavor.  The veggies on the side still had texture without being raw. The guacamole that came on the side seemed to be freshly made.  The rice was probably one of the best I've had.  I don't like it when they add veggies in with the rice.  I just want rice.  And it wasn't crunchy.  The only real negative was the salsa that seemed store bought with fresh chopped cilantro thrown in just to fool you.  Summary-- One of the better Mexican restaurants in Surprise (I know that's not saying much but...) and it seems that sitting in a booth is much better than sitting at the bar.  I will probably go again at some point to see if the service and food is consistent or if it's a case of hit and miss."}
{"text":"Tried this place three times, got sick twice. The food is bland and isn't any thing to write home around. Seems like we always had to wait even though we see tables open. I don't see what the hype is."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on Taco Tuesday and the food was delicious! Get the bean dip appetizer, it's the perfect snack before your meal. Living in Arizona, it's important to have a few go-to Mexican restaurants on hand for any out of town guests who need a taco fix. The staff was super friendly, too!"}
{"text":"The in laws were in town, so we had a babysitter!  You know what that means, right?  Time for a date with the wife!  They (dates) happen about 3 times a year, and tonight was one of them.  We wanted to stay semi local, and we both love Mexican food so we decided to try out Rio Mirage Cafe.   We walked inside and were seated immediately.  About that......we were shown to a booth and that was not a good thing.  Listen, I am a large man.  Me and some booths don't get along too well.  This was one of those booths.  It wasn't so much the space between my stomach and the table, but the height of the booth and table.  The table was pretty much laying on top of my legs and it was pretty damn uncomfortable.  They either need to raise the table heights about a foot, or lower the seats in the booth about a foot.  I noticed other diners were also looking a bit uncomfortable.  If I were to go back, I would 100% ask for a table...I suggest you do the same!  Anyways......we were brought chips and salsa and placed our order  for our drinks (Coke products).  We browsed the menu for a bit and we both decided to order a #11.  About 5 minutes later, our food was ready!   Here is how it was.............  Chips and Salsa-  The chips were nice and thin, but they had a little bit of a weird texture to them.  I have read other reviews and they have said that the chips are too \"oily\", and I would definitely agree with that.  They were crispy for the most part, but could have been fried at a higher temperature and browned a little more.  They served their purpose, but I have had much better restaurant tortilla chips.  The salsa was good and I like that they gave us 2 salsas at the table (one for each of us).  It wasn't hot at all but seemed very fresh and went well with the chips.  Combo #11-  This plate came with a cheese enchilada, 2 shredded beef tacos and a plate of rice and beans.  The enchilada was alright...standard cheese enchilada with red sauce.  The tacos were the best part of the meal....pretty solid except that they suffered from the same type of \"oiliness\" of the chips.  The shells were crisp though and the shredded beef tasted fine.  I would get the tacos again by themselves if we come back.  Rice and beans were your standard stuff.  Some pieces of the rice were crunchy and hard and the beans were a bit bland.  I ate most of them but wasn't super thrilled with them.  Service was very good, and very fast!  We were only in the restaurant for maybe 30 minutes total.  The manager came by and talked with us for a minute and our server and busboys were very thorough and made sure we had everything we needed.    Would I come back?  Eh, probably?  Total after tip and everything was just over $41.00.  That is a little steep for the quality of food, but the service was fast and friendly and the food was A-OK...exactly what 3 stars is.  This is the type of place you would come back to if someone else was paying and wanted a sit down Mexican place in Surprise."}
{"text":"Good solid Mexican food.  I loved the taco shells.  The filling lacked seasoning.  Average salsa that comes in a small portion.  Also tried The albondigas and it was good but not great (maybe I am picky because I have had great). Cheese enchiladas was my highlight.  Was really good and fresh.  Just because they got 3 stars does not mean this is an average restaurant.  The service was good.  Manager was visible and engaging guests.  They were on a wait and handled it professionally.  I just have a higher standard when it comes to Mexican Restaurants.  This place is good and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant experience. Food is always amazing. Their ground beef is phenomenal. Their guacamole is so flavorful!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm uncertain why the low Yelp reviews - we're in town visiting my parents at Sun City Grand and wanted a local Mexican place. When we arrived, there was a 25 minute wait for a table, so we sat at the bar. The bartender, JC, was great! Very personable and had great suggestions for margaritas for us to try.  Even the people who sat next to us at the bar were great to talk with. My wife and I both had steak fajitas. Excellent!  Overall, we were both happy with our experience."}
{"text":"Can't beat this Mexican restaurant for charm and authenticity. The fajitas/burrito is awesome. A must try and get it enchilada style. The tacos are stuffed full of meat. Staff is friendly and quick to respond to your needs. Drink refills are important to me and the servers I have had do a good job of keeping up. Busy for lunch or dinner but wait is usually quick. Haven't tried take out yet but will soon. Family and friends have all said what a good time they have had here"}
{"text":"Better Mexican food than back home in Texas where I'm from...JC and Carlos are their two best waiters, very personable and all around great guys! I recommend to ask for them if you visit."}
{"text":"Nice place that brings out the Mexican culture. I ordered the carne asada. It was delicious and everything on the plate was good. Staff made some simple mistakes and own up to the mistakes and apologize immediately. It's a good restaurant and I would consider it."}
{"text":"Delicious! I'm glad we decided to stop here for lunch. We started off with the guacamole (baby approved) and haberno salsa (yum!). l had the green corn tamale on the lunch special and my boyfriend had the Tio Rico burrito without meat. Our food was very good! Our server was Michael. He was very nice and attentive. Will be back when in area."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Mexican restaurants in the area. Very nice place and the staff was very nice too. The enchiladas are awesome!!! The chips and salsa were cooked fresh and the salsa was just right on spice. We have finally found something comparable to what we are used to in Chicago.  We will be coming back REAL soon!"}
{"text":"Well, we finally found a GOOD Mexican Restaurant. Great atmosphere and food. And, you get reasonable proportions for your money. The accommodations are great, too. Overall, it is a restaurant that I will frequent when I'm hankerin' for good Mexican food. I reviewed another Surprise, AZ. Mexican restaurant with less than glowing remarks. I can say nothing bad about THIS restaurant. Try it!"}
{"text":"We moved to Sun City a little over a year ago. My friends invited me out to lunch and this is where we came. The salsa for the traditional chips and salsa appetizer was exceptional and very fresh.  The waiter would bring various hot sauces so you could personalize your taste. I ordered Enchiladas with rice and beans, a safe choice.  My taste bud exploded.  Ever since that experience Rio Mirage is the go to destination to bring visitors, large groups of friends and just lunch or dinner with family and the friends who first introduced me to the yummiest ever traditional mexican food.  I ordered fish tacos one time, only because I was curious...amazing flavor and plated perfectly.  I would suggest for dinner:  The Carne Machaca Dinner Shredded roast beef saut√©ed with our unique spices, onions, tomatoes, green chile peppers and jalapeno peppers topped with spicy Ranchero sauce. The Mexican flan for dessert  is incomparable to any other restaurant.  This is a must try for a special occasion or a Prickly pear margarita and lunch, or just because your hungry,  The wait staff is attentive, warm and friendly.  Don't forget Sunday brunch. The best time to try all the foods you were afraid to order that you will completely fall in love with. Ten thumbs up."}
{"text":"Very good skinny Margarita. However service was poor and in the bar the empty glasses were pilled onto it and took up two seats. Service was o.k. we had to ask for place setting and other things. But it got better by the end.  The food was good. I will try again but if that bar is pilled high with empty used glasses I would call the health department."}
{"text":"listed under gluten free. they do not have gluten free.they dont seem to be to sure what you can have. not sure if chips are all corn or not. do not recommend for gluten free. try ajo als or macauyo for gluten free menu"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times and it has always been great. They do a good job and the service is the best. Just the last time we were there I made a mistake reading the menu and got something other than what I wanted. The manager was so nice and he got me the meal I thought I had ordered and gave me credit for the dinner I sent back."}
{"text":"Best place for Mexican food in surprise and we've tried a lot! We've eaten here a few times. Last week was for a birthday celebration and there was 7 of us, all drinking and eating so a good sized bill and we were all shocked when the restaurant didn't honor a 'birthday' how other restaurants would have. The waitress was told at the beginning we were there specifically for a birthday and nothing special was done. This was the only misfortune we had there."}
{"text":"Not that good. Service wasnt that great to begin with but could have been saved with some decent food. The salsa and chips are good and were my wife and I's favorite of the meal. My wife had the chimichanga and thought it was disgusting. I had the steak and chicken fajitas and they were awful. Tasted like old grease.  If you are in the mood for mexican food I would go someplace else. Not recommended."}
{"text":"So I decided to give Rio another chance since my first visit over a year ago. Sadly,  the failed worst than the first time. First, tjeu had us wait for 30 minutes for a party of 3 when we walk back to the sitting area, there were 6 large tables empty which each table sat 6. Then we food finally arrived, both the taco and tostada was placed over red enchilada sauce and both were soggy as hell not to mention food was lukewarm. Then they gave us beef rather than chicken fajita salad. The waiter had attitude when we ask for fresh taco and tostada and to have it on a dry plate and literally rolled his eye's when we also told him about how we ordered the chicken fajita salad and not the beef. This guy was so bothered. When he came back with the right orders he told my father that the tostada was made right and still crunchy when he told it back.  Im like no it wasn't as my dad tried to lift it and it tore into several pieces. He told that didn't happen!. WTF. I asked you want to stand there and argue with me about this?  He said no that it was probably the bed of lettuce they put under it and for next time, we need to order tace and tostada to be placed on a separate plate. I told him that ain't going to happen because we're never coming back. I'd rather drive 20 miles to Garica's or El Comedor where both service and food is always consistently GREAT! Check please. Their staff sucks and can break a restaurant too!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here has been fantastic!  Fast serve also, both in house and carry out.  The burrito pollo especial is my favorite, so far."}
{"text":"Veronica was amazing and customer service was outstanding.. best Mexican food I have had in a long time... best customer service I have had... thank you az for being so accomidating.."}
{"text":"2nd visit in a week and this time was worse. A week ago this place was packed. It took over 20 minutes to be seated and we waited over 30 minutes after ordering before being served.   This last visit we waited 30 minutes to be seated and almost an hour AFTER ORDERING to get our food.   We asked for the manager and 15 minutes later the manager came over to our table. Looking absolutely beaten down to a pulp he said the kitchen was over worked and they couldn't keep up with the busy orders. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE for a large well established restaurant with multiple locations.   While the food was just average the entire menu seems somewhat overpriced for what you get.   Not the only choice around the area and it's time to give our business to other places.   Maybe, had the manager taken care of our meals, or offered another round \"on the house\" we might consider another visit. Doubt we will return to The Rio.  If your in the mood for Mexican food try another establishment."}
{"text":"Average service and average mexican food. Great if you're close but nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"I'm a long time patron. My wife and I have been to the restaurant approximately 25 times in the last year. Always great service. We decided to get takeout instead last night. I picked up the food from ERICA at the front checkin. When we got home we noticed we didn't have the salsa we paid for. We did have the chips! Lol. My wife called merely to let them know the salsa was left out confident they would take care of us on the next visit. Basically a courtesy call. Erica without putting my wife on hold said to Alex the manager \"Alex this BITCH on the phone is lying. I put the chips n salsa in bag myself\".  My wife heard this bc it was all live! Alex got on the phone and argued with my wife. Introduced himself. First he denied Erica said what she did ( I presume he thought she was on hold).  My wife told him she knew he heard bc she heard the conversation between he n Erica. My wife said we have the chips. We are not making a big deal we just wanted Yu to know the $3.25 salsa is not in bag. That's all. Now things are different bc Erica spoke abusively about my wife. Alex said \"I AM not gonna fire her.  I can't get enough help as it is\" ( folks you can't make this stuff up! WOW!) we asked for the owners name. \"Rachel\" they said. We Informed them we would call back tomorrow. Erica answered tonight and evasively would not say when Rachel would be available. Guess I'll have to set up a meeting in person with the owner to set this right because this is all unbelievably Wrong."}
