{"text":"The restaurant is clean, the atmosphere was  friendly and the food was phenomenal. I can't wait to go back ."}
{"text":"Wow! I was warmly greeted by one of the owners and quickly shown to a table. My wife and I tried the fish cake and Tom Kha (coconut soup). On a scale of 1-5, the soup is an easy 10!! Overall, the staff was always quick to help us and very courteous.  The atmosphere is fresh and modern."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in Ahwatukee. Delicious curries and the papaya salad is excellent. Wonderful service too."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai! The spicy cashew has wonderful flavor. I got it medium heat which was perfect for someone that doesn't want it too spicy. Service was great. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time tonight and it was one of the best decisions ever!! Everything we had was superb. I had the beef massaman curry, my husband had the pad Thai, and our friends got the red curry with chicken. Each dish was better than the last, although my favorite was the massaman curry. It was creamy and spicy and filling. I couldn't even eat half of it! So much yummy food.   In addition, the service was incredible and the decor was really fun and upbeat. We were certainly not the only people that have heard how good this place is, because every table was full, even on a Monday night!   Can't recommend this place enough. It is truly delicious, and some of the best Thai food I have had outside of Thailand."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Green curry had lots of veggies compared to some places that just serve the curry with a few veggies. Garlic dish w seafood was delicious and full recipe f seafood. We will definitely be going back to try out other dishes!"}
{"text":"This is a true gem in Rantoul. The food is delicious. The service is excellent, and the place is super clean. I can't decide what is my favorite because everything I've had there is so great. Carry out service is super fast if you're wanting something to go.   I like how you can adjust your preference of spice on the entrees. The staff is very attentive. When I ordered a dish without meat and then ordered spring rolls as a side, the waiter asked me if I'd like my spring rolls vegetarian as well. So thoughtful!   You need to try this place. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I had an order of spring rolls and tofu red curry delivered by Postmates tonight. My first time trying this new Thai restaurant. The spring rolls were a bit soggy, but that is to be expected for takeout. The curry was good. I like it mild and it was perfect. I like broccoli added and they put an ample amount in for me! My only critique is that the tofu was cut into very large pieces that barely fit into my mouth by itself. No rice/veg with your tofu because it's so big. Maybe cut it in half?  Also, the curry came in a regular takeout platter... it spilled into the bag a bit. Hopefully they get the soup containers that other Thai restaurants use soon.  I only took 1 star off instead of 2 because this is a small, local business and I don't want a low review to affect them because the food was good for the most part!"}
{"text":"Great Tom Kha and Excellent Panang Curry.  The place appears to have recently opened. Very friendly staff and great service."}
{"text":"So happy to have found another great local restaurant in our neighborhood! I ordered my food for pickup. It was very fast & the restaurant was really cute & clean when I went to pick it up. I ordered the yellow curry with chicken. It was still a good temperature by the time I got it home. The mild spicy level was perfect for someone wanting the flavor without sweating through your meal! I'll definitely go back! Can't wait to try one of their noodle dishes."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. First I must say the soup was very good  but it went down from there. My husband and I both ordered the dishes medium hot. Not only were they not spicy they had no taste at all. The egg rolls were served ice cold. To top this off we witnessed the food server fixing her hair over the food she was about to serve another table. We won't be going back"}
{"text":"Perhaps one of the best Thai restaurant for miles.  Dishes taste fresh and delicious They are careful with the spicy heat of the dishes as we'll.  Simple atmosphere and great prices.  It is worth the drive from Champaigm Urbana"}
{"text":"Came in today for the opening lunch, free food was delicious!! I tried the famous thai tea and I absolutely loved it. I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice over the past couple of weeks and absolutely love it! The food is excellence and the wait staff is very pleasant and helpful in selecting meals. My new \"go to\" spot for Thai food."}
{"text":"We had the crispy duck and chicken green curry with plain rice.  The chicken green curry was good but the crispy duck was not. The rice was really old. The Thai tea was ok but too much cream. My recommendation is to stick with the curry as takeout and make your own rice at home."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I had the Lava Chicken.  It is all white meat!  The breading is crispy and not heavy! You can taste Chicken!  Great quality!  Fresh broccoli!  This place is better then any Chinese place in champaign Co. I will go back and try other items too.  I wish I had went before now.  I think having it say Thai instead of Chinese was the difference.  The old saying don't knock it until you try it! We need to support local to keep places open!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find in the middle of Rantoul. We are from Chicago so we were not sure what to expect. We read the reviews and decided to eat an early dinner there. The food was excellent. I had the basil chicken which was very tasteful. My husband had the pineapple chicken and wanted it very spicy. The waiter told him choose a number 0-6 to determine the spiciness. He chose 4. It was a good choice because the spice was a bit intense but not so that he would feel uncomfortable eating. Crab Rangoon was better than most. All in all...a very nice meal. We will certainly dine there when we are in the area."}
{"text":"It takes us 45 minutes to get here from our home, but it's well worth it! Friendly staff, comfortable modern atmosphere with excellent food. Highly recommend the yellow curry with calamari, chicken pad thai, and panang curry."}
{"text":"Some of the BEST Thai food I have had in a while. I got the red curry with chicken. Full of flavor without out being too spicy for its Mild rating. Size was enough for two full meals. Service was excellent!   I have tried all of the Thai places in the area and Taste of Thai is definitely the best of them!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place! The best Thai Curry in Arizona and I mean that on the set... I have eat in many different hair restaurants in AZ and this is theeeee best."}
{"text":"So delicious. Amazing flavors bursting at the seams that leave you hungry for more to come. Thai coffee is a definite signature drink to try."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout through Eat24. Overall the food was very good. Fresh ingredients, good portion size, and lots of Thai flavors (no Americanized food in sight). Ordered most of our food \"hot\" which is their second highest spice level, and it was very spicy, in a good way. No need to order Thai hot just to to get a medium spice level here. We did encounter a few problems. First, it took over an hour for our order to be ready. Second, we ordered Pad See Ew mild for our kids - who can handle a little bit of spice - and they couldn't eat it because it was too spicy. Third, one of our items was wrong. I called to complain and they were nice enough to comp the two items. Will definitely give it another try, especially since the food was so good, but might eat in or call in my order next time and maybe limit it to those who can handle the spice."}
{"text":"So both my wife and I noticed immediately that the vegetables were extremely fresh. We totally love this place will be back in the future"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful crispy tofu noodle dish. A 2 spicy still has a kick but perfect flavors bursting onto your mouth. Definitely be back again to try another dish."}
{"text":"Best green curry I've had in years. Everyone's real nice and food is great. If you like spicy ask for Thai spicy x2."}
{"text":"So packed with Thai flavors, spicy, clean and fresh. Perfect for lunch or dinner. Yes you can taylor your spice level but I went all the way and got exactly what I was looking for as a lover of all things spicy."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had (note: I'm not big Thai fan so I have not tried many places). Service is average. Portions are HUGE. I love spicy food so went with the Thai-Hot and was enjoying my food (yellow curry shrimp) as I was crying and sweating simultaneously. Will definitely go back often and highly recommend."}
{"text":"They are not afraid to use spice....if you order a 3, you will get a 3!  Great thai food!  And they deliver!"}
{"text":"Just Great Thai food . bacon fried rice is heaven, curries are amazing., etc. sweet family run and a gem of an addition to the improving Ahwatukee dining scene .  Bravo!"}
{"text":"I had the tom yum fried rice and the pad thai. I thought that the tom yom fried rice was flavorful, but it had a lot of mushrooms in it. It was good that they had real pieces of lemongrass and galangal in it. Although they could have taken them out after cooking the dish so that diners didn't end up with a hard piece of lemongrass or galangal in their mouth when eating. The pad thai consisted of smaller rice noodles than I usually see in the dish. There was no lime slice, but it had peanut pieces. The pad thai dish was the type that had the orange pad thai sauce instead of the brown one that I sometimes see in pad thai dishes. The chicken wasn't dry either. I also checked into the restaurant and received a free thai ice tea. Overall the food was tasty but nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"Thanks excellent food, the portions are small but delicious and we order a big soup and a Maine search so we were ok , the service was good! And the Temperature was way to warm! Particularly when you eat their space food.  I will go back and ask them to do something about the a/c if necessary, the Ginger dishes are amazing."}
{"text":"I tried their chicken pineapple curry via delivery. The entree was everything I expected it to be. Rich, slightly spicy with just the right amount of sweet & spice. Rice was fresh, warm and just sticky enough to eat easily with chopsticks. This is one of my all time Thai dishes so I was quite pleased. I was not however impressed by the cucumber salad/relish. It was mostly brine and way too sweet. No deal at $2 per side as there was only maybe 2 bites of cucumber per side. I'll definitely continuing patronizing this restaurant but won't order the cucumber again"}
{"text":"If you want to fully satisfy your craving for awesome Thai food; here is \"the spot\" for you. Friendly attentive prompt service! Everyone is proudly presenting their food and culture which apparently I've pleasantly experienced. Trust me you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We went tonight after reading the reviews on Yelp. The food lived up to all the great reviews. This family run business is great! Everyone was friendly and the restaurant is very clean. I had the Pad thai with level 3 spice.  It was very fresh and flavorful. It was pretty spicy and i can usually handle heat pretty well. My boyfriend had Pad Gra Prow level 3 spice. This dish was amazing. The veggies were cooked well, the sauce had heat with tons of flavor. We will definitely  be back here often. And the waitress even gave us free coconut ice cream at the end of our meal. That was also delicious. Do yourself a favor and check this place out the inside is small, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, service as well. The tom yum soup and the yellow curry are the best! Even the arnold palmer! Everything nice and clean."}
{"text":"Service was great & the food was amazing! 1st time here & definitely will not be the last!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  I ordered on yelp and after waiting a half hour they called and said they weren't able to bring us our order.   We will not order here again, unprofessional to say they least."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! Chicken Pho soup and the spring rolls, guilt free, and delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are HUGE fans of Thai food.  We are lucky, in that just recently in Ahwatukee, TWO new Thai restaurants have opened.  Taste of Thai is one of them.  So....this place is simply amazing.  We have picked up orders twice in the past 6 weeks; last night we actually went and sat in the restaurant to dine.  The place is super cute and has a modern vibe.  Tarn waited on us and she *might* have the friendliest personality I've run across yet.  To the food:  the flavors are layered, nuanced, and delightful.  We had the bacon fried rice, the Spicy Cashew with Beef (highly recommend) and have ordered several other dishes including one with duck.  The menu definitely has some surprises - things you don't typically find on a Thai menu.  We seriously love this place.  You will too!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have had in a long time hands-down! I have eating at millions of Thai restaurants in Arizona and this by far is my favorite so far they have the BEST TOM YUM SOUP I have ever had."}
{"text":"Great place to eat in Rantoul. Fast friendly service. Tom yum was served spicy even tho we didn't ask for it that way. Normally we have to ask for it spicy at thai places. The Tom yum soup is great. So is the pad thai."}
{"text":"This place was the most generous when it came to ordering curry. I've never received the amount of curry they gave at any other thai restaurant, and it was amazing! My wife got the \"spicy noodles\" which is just their version of drunken noodles. It was delicious but wish they gave more actual noodles as opposed to veggies. Overall a good go-to thai restaurant.  Make sure you check-in on yelp when you're there to receive a free thai iced-tea or thai coffee coupon!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! It is definitely one of the better pad Thais in the Ahwatukee area. They also have cheap delivery. Their spices noodles and pad see yew are also really good!"}
{"text":"So, this is a fairly new place here in Rantoul. I wasn't really sure what to expect because I am very particular about my Thai food. I grew up eating this type of food, so you better know what you're doing. Anyway, I ordered the red curry and my boyfriend ordered the pineapple chicken. We also ordered the rangoon, just to try it. I also had Thai iced tea. Everything tasted good and exactly how I would expect it to. We will be back."}
{"text":"We are avid Thai food regulars. When Taste of Thai opened we a bit curious but also had our regular go to. Tonight we decided to give this a try and I am so glad we did. We have a new \"go to\". We got the green curry, papaya salad, eggplant, pad Thai and satay. All were incredible. Each dish had a unique flavor and was delicious. We'll absolutely be back."}
{"text":"One of the few times I didn't agree with the Yelp rating. Tried the Pad Soon Sen and Fried Rice. Both tasted ok but nothing spectacular which is something I've come to expect from a good Thai restaurant?."}
{"text":"Two nights in a row...YES IT'S THAT GOOD. After telling or neighbors about this place we opted to do take out AGAIN! It was every bit as good as the first time. We had the veggie rolls and crab wontons as appetizers and they were delicious. Often ordering fried items to-go can be a disaster (mushy, oily and soft) NOT HERE! They were hot and beautifully crispy. For dinner...a different style of curry, Beef Masaman, and Spicy Cashew chicken. Both were delectable! The Masaman had tender pieces of beef and potato...hearty and comforting. As a side we opted for the coconut rice...sweet rice cake smothered in coconut milk. This could easily have been our dessert. We plan on continuing our culinary journey through Thailand one dish at a time...until we exhaust the menu! If you haven't been here yet you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Snuck in before 3 p.m. breaktime, they reopen at 5. Simple high quality tables and chairs. Super clean. Simple menu for those of us not well versed in Thai food. Easy decision making. Ice cold water served right away with their Hot Sour soup..then we ordered . Outstanding..stay with the medium heat and most everyone will be happy. Pleasant , peaceful in the afternoon"}
{"text":"You have to eat the masman beef it's amazing, like your moms slow cooker pot roast... but if your mom was an amazing Thai chef. The papaya salad with preserved crab is authentic and delish, but probably not a good option if it's your first time eating Thai. The unsweetened ice tea is an amazing refreshing Thai version of ice tea (not sweet and creamy, ask for Thai tea if you like it that way). It's awesome to finally have good Thai food in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"We got delivery, and the curry had poured out into the bag it was in and all over everything inside of it. I think that put a damper on the experience. I'm not sure if it was a delivery service or if it was delivered by the restaurant, but either way, they need to take better care to make sure that the food stays out during travel."}
{"text":"Ordered to go, very impressed. Had the pad Thai, asked for it spicy. Very good flavor and good portion size. Will be back."}
{"text":"They are fairly new in town, a long with a few other Thai joints all in a few miles of one another. Taste of Thai has risen to the top of that crowd. We have had take out from them several times and have never been disappointed. We haven't had a bad dish yet and the ones we have tried include: garlic lover, pad thai, green curry, and the coconut soup. The soup was the only thing I wasn't blown away by and would likely not order again. The curry was my favorite; hubby really enjoyed the garlic lover. They know how to bring the Thai heat. Have yet to try the bacon fried rice, but it catches my eye every time."}
{"text":"Just had my first order from here, and it was delivered via Eat24. Wow. The food was hot, the food was made as requested, and the food was fresh! I will definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now and everything we've had has been great. Pricing is reasonable and service is quick and friendly. Highly recommend the red curry with chicken. It's great having a good, legitimate Thai place in Ahwatukee. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have visited this Thai place before several times for dine in with my family . I ordered Eggplant Garlic with Tofu . Today, thus dish was a big disappointment! I have had this dish before and it was very good Today the egg plant was old and hard to chew, and very few pieces of eggplant in the dish , mostly filled with Bamboo shoots, today!  Looks like this place is having a hard being  Consistent with preparing their food. Sometimes it's great and other times it is poor , like today"}
{"text":"SOOOO GOOD!! I loved their Pad Thai. The portions are perfect, tons of flavor, and I liked the appetizer soup. Very nice interior decorating too. :)"}
{"text":"I went to this Thai restaurant because it was close to ikea and I was hungry, but next time I'm in Phoenix I'll probably return. It was clean, well decorated, it had friendly staff, and it was incredibly reasonably priced. I can't recommend the Thai Iced Tea enough. I'll probably dream of it for a while yet. I also enjoyed the Green Curry. Great place with great food."}
{"text":"So amazing! Make sure you know spicy mean spicy! Love the atmosphere!! Also, they have really good specials and I orders the pad Thai which was amazing. My friend ordered the curry and she loved it!"}
{"text":"First time trying the food from here. Ordered for delivery which I know isn't always the same as eating in the restaurant. The tofu was over cooked, fried a bit too long so was a bit on the hard side but the dipping sauce was delish. We also had the chicken satay which was really good with the traditional peanut dipping sauce.  We ordered chicken panang curry mild which we though may be a bit on the soupy side but once on the rice was quite tasty. Will order medium next time though as the mild didn't have any heat to it. Got the pineapple fried rice medium and it was fantastic! So all in all not terribly disappointed and will be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai restaurant! I drive past this plaza every day, and it was great to see a Thai restaurant pop up. The restaurant is family-run, is very clean and has a nice look, and best of all, serves great food!  I got the Eastern Thai Salad and the Spicy Noodles with chicken, both of which were packed with flavor and a nice amount of heat. I could tell everything was fresh, and my food was made in a very timely manner.   For me, one of the most satisfying feelings is being full from fresh, wholesome food. This certainly took the cake. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far my wife and I favorite Thai place in Phoenix. We visited for the first time with friends who were visiting and we all loved it. The food is fresh, service is friendly and decorations are pretty nice. We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I have been going here since they opened and have had just about everything on their menu and have to say it is all delicious very fresh ingredients and very large portions, I can always get a couple meals out of  everything I have ordered.  The service is always spot on and the place is always clean and bright.  It is a great place for date night.. Keep up the great job."}
{"text":"We loved this place... don't even think twice, order the yellow curry... it transported me, it was that good. My boyfriend had the Rad Nar and felt just as strongly about it, but I still say get the yellow curry.   Nice atmosphere, solid service... we will be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Pad Thai, shrimp appetizer, coconut sticky rice and steamed vegetables. It all came to $31 including delivery, not bad I guess....but the portions seemed so small for how much I paid!   The rice and veggies- okay The shrimp - tasty The Pad Thai- burnt! The entire bottom was black and inedible. So disappointed! For such a basic Thai dish, I'm surprised that they would serve burnt noodles. The tamarind sauce has a completely horrible flavor once it's burned.  Won't order again"}
{"text":"Tom Yum is good, crab puffs are good, stop watering down the sweet n sour sauce (it should never be the consistency of cough syrup, for the record) and you'll be in good shape."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Finger licking good. Tad bit expensive. I was charged $2 for fish sauce on my takeout. Not cool."}
{"text":"This place is awesome food is delicious, service is wonderful, and they deliver. I love this place"}
{"text":"Comfortable, casual atmosphere. Great Thai food. So far the best Pad Thai I've had in Phoenix. We order pretty regularly from Uber eats. Would absolutely recommend. Compared to other Thai food in the area I think the \"star\" system for spice level runs hotter than average so if you typically order your food hot consider stepping it down to medium. If like your food hot their traditional Thai spicy is actually quite hot."}
{"text":"Great Experience! Glad they are part of the neighborhood. I will be returning again. Great service! Great food! Get the medium spice, the mild is a little to weak for me and I am a wimp"}
{"text":"Had thai after a long time. Ordered Pad Thai noodles with fried tofu. Fried tofu is kinda crispy like no where else and tasted good. Would recommend spice level not more than 3.  Good ambience."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Not great.  I ordered the dinner portion at lunchtime ... it was pretty small.  Not likely to return.  Sadly, within 6 months ... 3 Thai places within a 2 mile stretch ... all about a 3-star."}
{"text":"We loved this place.  Compared to other Thai restaurant on ray & 48th this one  is the best.  Staff was pleasant, service was good, food was authentic and sooo delicious.  The bathrooms were very clean as well which is always important no matter where you eat."}
{"text":"Friendly Service, Great Massaman Curry!  The waitress was really friendly and nice during my first visit here this week! She was super pleasant and made the trip comfortable.   The food was really good here as well. I really enjoyed my curry and left full and ready for a nap time for my food coma! I had the Thai Spicy version and it was delicious.   The interior is nice and clean and spacious so you are not crammed into other people and instead have ample space to eat and breathe.   You could drive right by for years and never even notice this place being here. I only found it because of yelp!  All in all this is a good spot for a feeding!"}
{"text":"We ordered from Taste Of Thai at least once per week. Lately the takeout has been very bad. We like the food very much but today I was on hold for over six minutes and then hung up and called back and got no answer. This is probably the third time we've been on hold for over five minutes. If business is so good and hire more people. We ended up going to Thai Basil Because we didn't want to keep trying to call this place. We may have to rethink our choices in the future."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this place by chance. I must say the food was excellent. We got tum kha, pad thai, spicy fish and panang curry. All were delicious!  And great friendly service too. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Loved the pot stickers, they were a little crispy. I liked how the food was hot when it arrived. The pad thai is the best in the city!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food, great atmosphere, and kind people. I had the spring rolls and red curry - medium and it came out perfect! I can't wait to go back for seconds."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Best Thai restaurant in Ahwatukee region thus far! Really know how to accommodate their guests and gives you great portion sized foods. Authentic ! Good people run this place :) will come and eat here again !"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food and sleek decor. I would recommend to be conservative on the spicy scale though, we ordered 3 (from 1-5) and that had us panting the whole meal. The pad see yew and red pineapple shrimp curry both had incredible flavor!"}
{"text":"Taste of Thai is a great unassuming spot with tasty dishes that made me glad to stop while in the neighborhood.   The interior is full of natural light from the big front windows, and the neutral tones makes the whole place feel simple and refreshing. Friendly service rounded out my positive first impression.   Taste of Thai's menu is easy to navigate but hard to choose from. There are noodles and curries and marinated meats--oh my! At our table we picked the \"garlic love\" with beef and the \"spicy cashew\" with chicken, both flavorful options that left us full for the rest of the day. My one regret was not ordering a higher spice level!  For anyone in south Tempe or Chandler, give this place a try."}
{"text":"The yellow curry was great!  Quantity of rice was enough to cool the thai hot heat that I ordered.  The duck curry that my wife ordered looked fabulous.   Service was also very good.  Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered basic spicy chicken and rice.  Was very bland and was not spicy. Their medium spicy mine as well be zero spicy!  Very small portion and came with cold egg roll. Prices are too high for the small amount of food that is served.  Thai Basil is 100% better."}
{"text":"Took my guy here for Father's Day and it was great!  I had the red curry with just veggies and my guy had the tofu fried rice and both were amazing!  Started with some spring rolls too which were hot and crispy!  Was excited when they brought out complimentary coconut ice cream, but was disappointed when I found out it wasn't dairy free.  Won't keep me from going back though.  Cute decor too and they serve alcohol which is great because my guy just happens to love a cold beer with his spicy fried rice!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place to-date.  I have ordered from here 3 - maybe 4 - times, and each time it was absolutely delicious.  I love the yellow curry with chicken, the fried rice with pork & the crab/cream cheese puffs. The first time I ordered the curry 'hot' (extra spicy) - it was delicious, but really too hot for me.  Now I go mild, but pair it with a medium-hot fried rice with pork.  Incredible.  I've used Yelp delivery each time I've ordered & the food was always fresh and hot, and delivery people very friendly."}
{"text":"Second time ordering from this place and it was a better experience. Ordered the eastern papaya salad, asked for extra Thai hot and it was spicier this time around, which I appreciated. Chicken satay is good too."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! Food is amazing! We've tried numerous items on the menu but I think my favorite will always be the yellow curry with chicken.  And they deliver which is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and everything was delicious! Yummy vegetables in the green curry, tofu cooked perfectly and high quality.  Pad see ew was great. Will definitely eat from here again!"}
{"text":"The chicken Pad Thai was outstanding! The wife and I both got spice level \"Thai Hot\", and wow! It was hot and very flavorful!  We ordered ours carry out and even after a 10 minutes drive back to the hotel, when we got sat down and popped the boxes open, we found a beautiful, visually appealing dish with a good amount of bean sprouts and crushed peanuts. Honestly, the amount of noodles seemed lackluster at first but after about 10 minutes of eating I had hardly made a dent! There is a lot more in there than you think! The chicken was thin and flavorful, the noodles were outstanding and the value was exceptional!  Inside the restaurant for pick-up was nicely designed, with a tip of the hat to a modern eatery in the lighting. I really would've enjoyed staying and eating there so I'd say the interior is inviting for sure.   I was able to check in and redeem the offer for a free Thai Iced Tea for Yelpers. I really enjoyed that and am looking forward to coming back on my next visit to Phoenix.   5 well-deserved stars, for sure!"}
{"text":"The Thai tea here is excellent and it's a nice cozy environment with super friendly staff!  I love the pad Thai, the pad see ew and the bacon fried rice!!"}
{"text":"We love this place!! You have to try their bacon fried rice! It's one of a kind! We have ordered several entrees and all have been delicious! We especially love the Pad Thai. The place is clean and the staff is always friendly. A hidden gem in Ahwatukee for sure."}
{"text":"Just an update the spice seems to have just been out the one time I ate there. Every other time the spice has been great! The Tom Yum soup is to die for and my wife almost fought me over it. Huge fan of this place."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic! Great and friendly service as well. Newly built, cute and quaint place. Checked in through yelp and received a free thai iced tea coffee on the house right away and it was very yummy. We ordered the chicken pad Thai, garden delight and pad see son. All delicious and big portions. Just be careful on the spice level. We ordered 3,4&5 on scale of 1-5 and all of us tasted/felt the spice more than expected. I'd reorder again for sure!"}
{"text":"I will be coming back often from now on. We love thai food and have been looking for the best thai restaurant in town. The pad thai and pineapple fried rice were reallly good. Very authentic and delicious. The place seems to be very clean and new. I will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"I have ordered take out 5 or 6 times. Never an issue. Typically takes 20 to 30 minutes. I think their medium is more spicy than other restaurants. I had to start ordering mild plus because medium was too spicy for me."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I just ate the crap Rangoon and the best I ever had!! Can't wait to eat the rest of our meal! We ordered out ready in time and very kind!"}
{"text":"Great food enjoyed the duck go prow and wife had the tofu pad Thai. She enjoyed her meal and they brought a delicious complimentary ice cream out after the meals. Drove all the way from cave creek and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"First time here and came based on the reviews.  Yes, the yellow curry is wonderful.  My spouse got pad Thai, also delicious.  We will be back when we're south of the mountain again."}
{"text":"Ordered medium spiced yellow curry, it was so spiced the sauce was turning red from the amount of red chilis. Lips have been on fire for a while. The drunken noodles were even worse. I love thai food often ordering spicy items but this was extreme. I contacted the restaurant and they offered to take $2 off the $30 cost of the meal but would not consider replacing it.  This is unfortunate because we've had fried rice, drunken noodle and masaman here before and  never had anything prepped as medium come out this spicy. The cucumber salad was good."}
{"text":"SO good!!! I ordered a dish with medium heat, which at most places is almost no spice (3-4 out of 10), and I'll add chili sauce myself to get it how I like it, the medium here was more of a 7-8! My boyfriend got the yellow curry Hot, SO yummy! VERY spicy and absolutely the best curry flavor I've had at a restaurant! We also got pot stickers and veggie egg rolls, the egg rolls were nothing special but they were good! The pot stickers had great flavor but were definitely overcooked on the outside. I can't wait to try more dishes here!"}
{"text":"The food is terrible! Worst Thai food I have ever had. It makes me think that the people who gave it positive reviews must not know what Thai food is supposed to taste like. I won't be returning. The food was so bad that I could not eat it and had to throw it out. It was a waste of money. I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and was debating on what to eat for dinner; lucky me a local Thai restaurant within walking distance ftom my house. I ordered the house fried rice (spicy) and I can't remember the name of this fish dish (medium spice); Let me say it was the BEST decision of my young life!!! Everything was soooo fresh and not over cooked. The spice level was perfect, though if you aren't into spicy food I would suggest you order on the not so spicy side.  I was brought back to a time my 8yr old self experienced Thai food for the first time in Anchorage,AK and goodness I fell back in love with the food/culture all over again.  The girls who were running the counter,  greeting guests, and taking orders--You guys were great!! Definitely a place I will continue to visit!!!  On a sidenote--The establishment is tiny, but more than adequate for a cute date night."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time for lunch today with my better half. Ordered the yellow curry, pad nar and veggie spring rolls. Also Thai iced tea. Excellent flavors all the way around. The yellow curry was spot on and just had the perfect amount of spice (medium). Of the 3 new Thai restaurants that have opened in the area recently, this is our favorite. Will definitely revisit soon to try other menu items. Also, the decor and service were both great. A great addition to this side of Tukee!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we dined here. While the service was slow due to having only one waitress for the entire place the food itself was very good overall. We had egg roll appetizers that were crisp but not spectacular. Next time we are trying the crab Rangoon which another table had that looked really good. We opted for the Lava chicken and Ginger shrimp. Both of which were excellent. The Lava chicken is crispy non-breaded pieces of chicken in a slightly spicy sweet sauce.  The ginger shrimp  is packed with gingery flavor with lots of green and red pepper chunks,mushrooms, carrots and onion.  Both come with the usual white rice but we also opted for beef fried rice which was very good but again not spectacular.  Overall we enjoyed our meal and sympathized with the overworked waitress.  I do hope this little place will be around  for the long haul, it is an asset to the town."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my best Thai restaurants I visited so far, just the right amount of food for lunch flavors were amazing. Fast service"}
{"text":"I placed my order to go through Amazon at a non peak hour so they wouldn't be busy yet it still took them 50 minutes to prepare my food before the driver was able to pick up and deliver.   I had the Tom Yum Soup with tofu and requested a mild spice level but the soup was extremely spicy. I had to dilute it with water just to be able to eat it yet  my lips were still on fire. The soup was orange due to the excessive amount of hot chili oil. It had huge chunks of tofu at the bottom not small diced tofu and a plethora of mushrooms.   For my entree I had the Pad See Ew with tofu. There were hardly any noodles but instead it was packed with very large thick large chunks of bland tofu, some sliced Chinese broccoli and a ton of raw bean sprouts. Not exactly a noodle dish and unlike the soup, this dish had zero flavor. I was very disappointed. I ordered a side cucumber salad which was the only good thing about this meal but it wasn't a salad, just a tiny container (no larger than half my palm) with jalapeños and sliced cucumbers. It's really to pour over something not to eat separately. That made the meal edible.   I wouldn't order food from here again nor dine in. Disappointing overall. See my photos for pictures of the meal."}
{"text":"We looked up a ton of reviews and decided last night to try this place out!!  The food was amazing!  Service was great!  I ordered the Yellow Curry and it was on point!  My husband ordered Pad See Ew with chicken and he said it was great. Spicy and he got Med heat. We also ordered the crab puffs and those were the best I have ever had!  Totally going back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing menu and variety! Superb customer service!! Very tasty soup and fried rice!! Definitely will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Free thai iced tea w/ yelp check in, and it's a v large serving too.  I got their red curry which was great, I liked the tofu in it and it was plenty of food. My dad got the pad Thai which he enjoyed.   There are a lot of Thai restaurants in Ahwatukee. I've yet to establish a favorite but Taste of Thai was certainly good and I would come here again."}
{"text":"Delicious! We tried several different dishes and each were flavorful, contained the perfect amount of spice, and were aesthetic to the eye!  Next time we go back we want to try the unique dish bacon fried rice! We drove from chandler looking for a good Thai place and we finally found one! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Very good food! We got takeout here for the first time and it was good! My favorite was the  mixed vegetables with tofu. The tofu was so delicious and was my favorite part of the meal. We also got pad see ew and pineapple fried rice; both were tasty. Our family doesn't like spicy food so the fact that you can order everything not spicy is great! We will be back to try more soon!"}
{"text":"Why did I find this restaurant so late?!?! I lived right around the corner and didn't eat there until the day I was moving to Vegas :( OMG the yellow curry was soooo good. Every time I visit Phoenix I have to make a stop there!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience today for lunch. Ordered the yellow curry with chicken and requested it to be hot. It was the perfect amount of spicy that didn't overpower the flavors but spicy enough that I needed to sip water.   Also got a Thai iced tea. It was one of the best ones I've had in a long time.   Service was great and fast. I will be going back again very soon."}
{"text":"Would not deliver our carry-out order and waited over 30 minutes after we ordered to let us know. Still have not received refund."}
{"text":"Lovely little hole-in-the-wall a few steps from Bashas. Reasonably veggie-friendly -- I had veggie spring rolls and spicy cashew with tofu.   Four spice levels. I think their hot-but-not-Thai-hot could be a little sharper, but I'm very happy to have one more independently-owned restaurant here."}
{"text":"This place opened up couple weeks ago near where  I live so I was happy to see another Thai place and wanted to try this place out.. I did a to go order, when I went inside the place was small but very clean and the staff seemed friendly.. but the food wasn't that great.. their sweet and sour chicken could have been more flavorful and for it being on the dinners menu I was expecting a little bigger portion but nope. It was about the same size has the lunch special pad Thai I ordered.. the pad Thai was okay but didn't like the noodles they used.. it's not the normal noodle I see.. it was thinner and more chewy which I didn't like.. I probably won't be back to this place.."}
{"text":"We tried Taste of Thai for the first time, sharing a takeout Cashew Chicken.  That was our litmus test to see if it was going to be OK.  And it definitely passed.  The chicken was lean, the veggies good and the sauce had substance and a nice flavor. And the portion size was good. We ordered medium spicy which was barely hot.  So next time we will go for hot and see what happens. Will be trying other items on the menu soon and I am optimistic that this will be a regular - joining two of our other nearby takeout places - Nellos and Macayos."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the most simplistically decorated, yet casually modern restaurants I've been to. Very nice.  I ordered the Thai Teriyaki Chicken, however was slightly disappointed to discover that egg was a minor ingredient in my meal. Unfortunately, I had recently developed an allergy to eggs, and had I known eggs were to be included I wouldn't have ordered that particular dish. I was ready to just pack it up to go and have my boyfriend at home eat it, when my waitress, Tara, came over to check up on me and saw that I was visibly upset. Frankly,  I wondered whether I should've bothered her with the issue in the first place. I mean, it wasn't her fault I didn't ask. I'd decided to explain my situation to her and she, with a genuine concern, asked if she could bring me a new plate without the egg. I humbly accepted her offer and received a brand new egg-free plate shortly after. The food was fantastic!  Great food, AMAZING customer service, and overall a wonderful place.  I'll certainly be coming back. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Panang curry I've found in the east valley since I've moved from Chicago. I'll be coming here more often! Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai meals I have had. I travel a lot and have eaten in many Thai restaurants. From the soup, to the beef salad, to the beef basil - all excellent. Too make it even better the prices are very reasonable Wow - A hidden treasure in Central Illinois!"}
{"text":"The tastiest food ever! The seasonings were perfect, vegetables fresh and meat was cooked to perfection. The atmosphere is contemporary oriental and service was excellent! We will come back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent service.... even an hour before closing time! Hot pot was sooooo good, even shareable. Get with a side of rice to our over! Huge selection of different fresh items! Can't wait to come back. Good job Taste of Thai! Last bit.... fried banana with ice cream was fantastic!!!!!!!  Ice cream was a creamy coconut dream."}
{"text":"Tried this place a couple times and it's good food with good Thai flavors. Although it's not our favorite Thai food place we might go back if only for the bacon fried rice, Which we didn't know existed but now is one of our favorites."}
{"text":"Great prices, especially for lunch, large portions, wonderful food. I was driving over 20 minutes for take out Thai before this place opened, now only about 7 minutes. Quick service, we ordered in store and waited less than 10 minutes, will call in next time just to be more efficient since there isn't a lot of seating space. I got the yellow curry and crispy spring rolls, both amazing. Boyfriend got the spicy noodles and enjoyed it.  We both had plenty to eat and enough for lunch the next day too. Will be back."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today. Ordered the yellow curry & my girl got a vegetable dish. Both were out of this world. Server was all over it but not over bearing. Place doesn't have a ton of seating but has plenty of good parking. Some of the best Thai I've ever had."}
{"text":"Well, I will give this place another try, but I will NOT order the pot stickers again! I ordered yellow curry, Tom Kha soup and pot stickers (wanted 2-3 meals out of it). Delivery was right on time, gentleman was sweet.  I was starving, and dug right in. I thought my lips would burn off!  I ordered Medium heat. I have ordered medium heat on Thai food in several states, AND in Thailand, with no problems.  I had to eat something, so I stuffed both the soup and the curry with white rice to cool it a little. Curry was edible this way, soup was STILL too spicy.   Good part: the flavor (behind the heat) and the ingredients were great-lots of carrot, potatoes and chicken. I assume they erred and made it HOT, not medium. I ate as much as my lips could take and went to bed HUNGRY!  THAT'S because the pot stickers were WAY overcooked, hard, dark burned and rubbery. INEDIBLE. see photo. WTF?  When I went to get the other half today to eat for lunch (can't waste $40.00) I saw that the curry was FULL of dried red pepper flakes; In the dark last night I couldn't see that. No wonder.  The soup had nice flavor behind heat so hot I could NOT eat it. Period. It was a bit skinny on the shrimp I noticed. Nothing horrible, maybe 5-6 medium small shrimp.   It was a great disappointment overall. I will give it another shot-one dish first, and try MILD heat-just to test it out."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared Veggie Thai rolls and Yellow Curry with tofu. He said it is the best Yellow Curry he has ever had.  The servers are very sweet and courteous."}
{"text":"Too bad I didn't have the same experience as the other reviewers. I found the food very bland, which is not what Thai is about. This was my first time there and maybe it was an off night. I hate giving a bad review on just one experience. So...there is a possibility I will give it another try."}
{"text":"Clean atmosphere small intimate place  Friendly service great location lots of choices of food"}
{"text":"Second day open and not disappointed.  Glad to have a Thai restaurant in the neighborhood! Best of luck!"}
{"text":"This was our second time eating at Taste of Thai. Both times we had both excellent service and food! We will absolutely be returning a third time."}
{"text":"Great food! Really great caring people, wonderful service, and for those of you looking for spicy but can never find spicy enough just say I want Thai hot and you will get your spicy food that also has the flavor!!!"}
{"text":"I had the silver noodles soup without chicken. It was so flavorful and filling but only had 2 shrimp."}
{"text":"We went here last night, we ordered the potstickers, a chicken curry and the roast duck, for dessert we had the coconut ice cream and the rice pudding with custard.  All the food was really good and met our expectations. The portions were pretty good too. I felt the duck was super spicy, but then I asked for hot (may have underestimated Thai spice :-D). I loved both the desserts, the rice pudding and custard had quite an unusual twist in a good way, the flavors were so different but yet so good!"}
{"text":"Adorable little restaurant. The yellow curry medium with tofu or veggies. Bomb!!!! Husband couldn't finish his tofu red curry hot. It was toooo hot. He loved it. Can't wait for the leftovers.  Will be back often."}
{"text":"Wow.  I have been hearing great things about this new joint in Ahwatukee, and after finally visiting, I now see why folks have been giving it rave reviews. I had the pad Thai and my wife the spicy cashew chicken. Both were excellent! It's a quaint little place, service was excellent, great music, sparkling clean bathroom. This will become our new go-to Thai place."}
{"text":"this is the best place to get great service and great food. plus the decor is very modern, chic and clean."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai food in the area! When we order takeout, it's always ready within 20-25 minutes. Their pad se ew is my favorite thing on the menu! And the portion is huge! They make their tofu nice and crispy. We also love the bacon fried rice, and the plain sticky rice! If you order medium spice, be warned it's closer to hot at other Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"I find this to be a treasure.   The spring rolls in rice noodles are the best with the fresh taste of basil.   I love their pad Thai. Also enjoy the pad Siew.    Service is quick and welcoming"}
{"text":"this food was delish!!  the vegetables were perfectly cooked - just a little crispy.  we asked for varying spiciness for each dish and they accommodated the requests nicely.  the portions are large (which helps since the prices are a little high) and the quality of ingredients was really noticeable.  the staff was friendly and came to check to see how we were liking everything.  I would definitely add this to my short list for good Thai places!"}
