{"text":"Why is this restaurant called SoHo? 

Is it an effort to capture the artsy-fartsy joie de vivre of Manhattan's neighborhood's namesake? Lord, I hope not. The restaurant is located across from PNC Park in just about the least artsy-fartsy neighborhood of Pittsburgh. But I guess Post-Game Drunken Fratboy Hangout doesn't really have a good ring to it.

Is it a nod to Pittsburgh's very own SoHo? Lord, I hope not. The restaurant has far more glam than the rundown neighborhood trapped between Duquesne University and South Oakland. But I guess Depressing Shithole doesn't have a good ring to it, either.

Whatever the story behind its namesake is a moot point upon experiencing the restaurant's fare. Here's what you can expect:

1. Meh food. The SoHo steak and cheese is essentially chopped steak and Cheez Whiz on a bun. It's not particularly delicious. The fries were good, though.

2. Outstanding drinks. Perfectly priced, elegantly presented, and expertly mixed. The Cinnamon Toast Crunch martini is ridiculously delicious. Honest to God, it tastes like a friggin' bowl of the cereal. Except with alcohol.

If you're in the North Side, go for a cocktail during Happy Hour, but don't schlep out for a special trip or for a memorable meal. You won't find it here."}
{"text":"No redeeming qualities here. Schwill on tap. Food was terrible - had the pizza, mac & cheese bites, and spinach & artichoke dip.  It was hardly edible. Stay away."}
{"text":"If you're dying for the recipe for their \"Buffalo Macaroni and Cheese\" than look no further! It was definitely some sort of boxed Mac & Cheese, with a chicken tender covered in Frank's Red Hot on top.  I have much higher expectations for food in a city that offers so many delicious options; I could have gotten an incredible mac & cheese at Meat and Potatoes for less money!"}
{"text":"For some reason the Yelp reviews I read did not depict my experience.  I experienced great service provided by Jess and the food, adult beverages, and Key Lime Pie was outstanding.  The next time I return to the Burgh, \"I'll be back\"."}
{"text":"decent place, feels very chainy.  but food was good enough had pepper hamburger which was pretty tasty.  Probably a little over priced for the food, but not bad all the way around."}
{"text":"Lots of LCD HD Screens make this a good place to check out a game. The atmosphere is a little bland, but this bar is part of the hotel it's connected to, so you can't expect it to be too crazy. All in all decent bar."}
{"text":"So, my daughter, her father and I visited SoHo after playing at the Science Center, on a Sunday evening. The restaurant only had about two other customers so we had the dining room to ourselves. The vibe was chill and our server was awesome. He took his time with us and put extra detail into accommodating my little munchkin. 
I ordered the Pittsburgher Chicken Salad which was decent, nothing to write home about. My significant other ordered the Meatloaf feature. His food looked so dry and inedible. He's not the type to complain about his food to the server, but I am. So the server took the food away after he tasted the horrible looking good and encouraged him to order something different. So he ordered the fish sandwich. It was pretty decent however you could tell it was just frozen fish. Are my expectations to high? How hard could it be to dip a piece of fish in some batter and fry it. I was disappointed with the lack of freshness. The chicken breasts in my salad were square mechanically processed strips too. 
Well, I don't see a reason to go back there. Unless, I had the same server, because he was refreshing. Service isn't what it used to be. Needless to say, it was \"aite\", nothing amazing."}
{"text":"If 2-stars means \"meh, I've had better\", then I'd have to give it 2 stars. I'd say if \"fine\" in the slightly pained way the means \"how about we think of someplace else. \"

Now, not that it's bad, because its not. A good beer selection, nice bar clean, nice staff.  Good place to watch the last round of the Masters. But if 3 stars means A-OK, I'd have to give 2.5.  The menu is uninspired, the food is ok but expensive, the decor is a little funny. 

Better places on the north shore."}
{"text":"Good restaurant with a diverse menu, I've been here 4 times now and always had a good meal. The Tuna appetizer is awesome, if you like heat get a burger with the ghost pepper cheese its hot but great, tuna entree is good as well as the steaks. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Good stuff.  I was in town for a couple days on business and decided to try SoHo.  My boss and I stopped in on a Tuesday to grab a bite to eat and have a drink or three.  I had the \"SoHo chicken florentine\" and my gluttenous superior ordered an entire chicken Alfredo pizza.  We both pigged out.  4 stars for so-so service.  Worth it, though."}
{"text":"Just your typical hotel-restaurant. 

They offer great happy hour and daily drink specials. 

Atmosphere was nice. Part restaurant, part sports bar. 

Food was average. Had the shrimp-crab bisque to start, which was easily the best thing I had that night. Then did a French dip sandwich for dinner, as there wasn't many \"dinner\" choices that intrigued me, and also the precious reviews of dinner dishes weren't good. Sandwich wasn't very good, typical bar cuisine though. Girlfriend had the chicken broccoli pasta, which was excessively cheesy. 

Overall, it's not bad, but won't knock your socks off. It certainly benefits by the lack of other restaurants near it."}
{"text":"Drinks were good, but when one of the bartenders decided we hadn't tipped enough, he told the rest of the bartenders to ignore us and make us wait, right in front of us. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Soho was disappointing. Lunch was very crowded, so we sat at the bar, even though there was an open table for 3 by the window. We were just 4, but they wouldn't let us put an extra seat at the open table. It was also very loud for a weekday, the noise from other tables carrying easily.

I ordered the french dip sandwich, with risotto on the side. To their credit, the risotto was delicious, but such a tiny portion, I inhaled it in no time. Especially considering the french dip was so boring. The meat and cheese was bland and the sauce had far too many herbs in it. Not to mention, the food is definitely over-priced. I don't think I'd go back, but if I did, I'd order the risotto and nothing else."}
{"text":"Worst food and service. The waiter was eating food while trying to take our order. Very slow and will never eat here again! 
Brought us napkins and forks after we had to eat with our fingers and when we got refills on water there was no ice in the cups. Just horrible."}
{"text":"SoHo clearly relies on the Pirates crowd across the street, and Steelers and Pitt games. When there's a game, the place is packed. Other times, it doesn't seem so busy. The food has been OK. It's generally bar food, with an effort to be more. Execution is varied. 

Try the seasoned tuna sandwich with a side of parmesan risotto; just tell them how you want the tuna cooked because they don't seem to know and will overcook it."}
{"text":"We just happened on SoHos after a Pirates game because there was no line. I had the Sonoma salad and my dining partner had the Turkey Club and fries. The food was delicious. Being able to sit outside and people watch was also a plus. We would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, the burger rivals any of the burgers I've had In Pittsburgh... But the pizza beats the \"local favorites."}
{"text":"We went to this place after the Pirate game.  There is an entrance from the SpringHill Suites to SoHo.  The bar was PACKED but there was room for seating to order food.  I had a burger and it was good.  The service was spot on.  Would recommend this place for the food and not having the music blasting through your chest like Mullens."}
{"text":"A fine choice if you're staying in the hotel. Kids menu; daily drink specials. Nothing special but certainly acceptable."}
{"text":"Stopped in at an odd hour after wandering over from the Warhol museum. Very good burgers, friendly if a bit slow service. The vibe is somewhere between a really upscale bar w/food, a hipster gastropub and a fancy restaurant slumming it with bar food. But it's good, and we'd return if we were in the area."}
{"text":"SoHos is only so so. 

This restaurant has the making of something nice with great decore and atmosphere. It also has good service.

The downsides to this restaurant is having not very good food. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything good yet but hey charged like the food was something great."}
{"text":"Spicy BLT was excellent! Jalape√±o Bacon and Basil Mayo...don't get me wrong, this isn't a high end establishment but that was a damn good sandwich. Friend with me was not impressed with the Filet Medallions on Bruschetta but the desserts were good and my BLT was GREAT!"}
{"text":"Menu in the room said \"1/2 price apps 5-7pm everyday\" menu in the elevator said \"1/2 price apps 5-7pm everyday\" menu at the restaurant read \"1/2 price apps 5-7pm everyday\" everyday mind you on all of the menus. Guess what not when there is a game I was told. What does that mean? Pirates, Steelers, Penguins etc? What day is there not a game? What a joke. THEY DO NOT HAVE 1/2 PRICE APPS!!!! Somewhat slow service and somewhat overpriced. $13 burgers, $4 domestic bottles. Look elsewhere there is a lot surrounding this place so you have options."}
{"text":"I got the buffalo chicken salad. No complaints. Wasn't the best salad I ever had nor the worst. You can't complain to much, the location is convenient. It seems like it would be great during a game."}
{"text":"After a number of visits I am upgrading SoHo to 4 stars - it's upscale bar food in a nice setting and one of the best options in the area around PNC Park.  The menu is large so I doubt much is all that fresh but SoHo serves standard bar appetizers as well as decent sandwiches and average burgers, plus even some entrees which generally seeem to be quite good.  They also offer a whole bunch of sides with your sandwich & burger rather than just automatically getting fries - gotta love the tater tots and even the mashed sweet potatoes are pretty good.

If you're in the area for a game or any reason, SoHo is a nice upscale option for food or a drink - and there are plenty of TV's for watching sports.  It's a good place to hang out."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and find it to be very average overall. The food is priced competitively to the other restaurants in the area but not as good by far. I have found that the service is usually very good even if the food is pretty mediocre. I have tried a burger, salad, turkey sandwich and steak sandwich and just found it to be average and over priced for the quality each time. It is a nice location right next to the ball park with booth and table options but that's about it."}
{"text":"I think 3 stars is giving SoHo the benefit of the doubt. I work on the north shore so have only been there for lunch. The food is pretty good, nothing spectacular but not terrible either. The prices, however, are outrageous. For what you get the food is way overpriced. The wait staff also doesn't write down your order so a lot of the time it comes out wrong. Usually they're very friendly and the service is pretty good."}
{"text":"Not worth it.  This is my second visit, I was hoping the first was an anomaly.  But no, this place is just not worth the price.  Tonight I had two well martinis a glass of mundane meritage buffalo perogies ( don't bother) and a margarita pizza with spinach and Italian sausage.  The bill was $70.  Good Holley begeezes.  The martinis are well made, but well drinks at $12?  The buffalo perogies just were blech I thought I'd be special here in Pittsburgh but no.  The pizza came out with most the spinach in one piled in one slice, not very much sausage for a $2 extra, and that was not distributed well either.  All in all, for spending $70, before tip, for mediocre food from an unimaginative and poorly performing kitchen, just not worth it."}
{"text":"A nice selection of drinks (reasonably priced for Downtown Pittsburgh + next to a stadium) and the menu was easy to follow with plenty of variety. 

Food was well cooked and fresh ingredients - it was worth sitting outside!"}
{"text":"Soho is very So-So.  

Restaurants.com had a coupon for buy $25 for $10.  I snagged it but the conditions were annoying- spend $45 to get the $25 and no alcohol is included.  BOO!

Anyways, I ordered the shrimp cocktail to start.  It was okay- 6 nice sized shrimp served in a martini glass with cocktail sauce and 2 lemon.  Not bad, the shrimp could have been a little colder.

For dinner Kev had the buffalo chicken wrap with onion rings and I had the cobb salad with a side of balsamic vin.  I like the cobb- avocado, chicken, pieces of bacon, toms, egg, lettuce.  It is good but nothing special.

Our server was nice.....

The food here is just very blah.  The atmosphere is good to watch a game.  

That $25 coupon didn't get us very far.  We ended up paying $54 with tip and with the coupon!  I guess our bill didn't add up to what we needed it to be to get the full bang for our buck?  Still confused.......

So-so is nothing special.

It's not priced right to win me over.  Nor is the food good enough."}
{"text":"Bar next to stadium
Typical
bar next to stadium place
Waitresses def looking for other jobs 
Not happy at all
This isn't even a game night"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped by here for a quick dinner before the Pirates game. Since it was a game day, they were offering a limited menu that boiled down to typical bar food. Sandwiches, wings, etc. But, WOW...what bar food it was!

The burgers were amazing. My dad got a steak salad that was delicious. I think my mother was able to get some sort of pasta dish that she really enjoyed as well.

Good food, at a fair price. I will be back the next time I am in the 'burgh for a game. :)"}
{"text":"Food is decent but, priced a bit high. The drinks on the oher hand are incredible.

Nice place a watch the game with hd tv's everywhere. 

Eat at Firewaters and come here for drinks."}
{"text":"Came to this hotel bar / restaurant on a Tues evening in December. No local home games and not much on TV except out-of-town hockey and 2nd rate college basketball. Probably an over-crowded zoo on Steeler game days, and probably crowded before / after Pirates games. Quiet but not dead on this night.

Normally a sports bar would get 3 stars from me just for having good (but not great) draft beer selection, lots of HDTV's playing all available games, decent (but not exceptional) food, good service, and a space that is clean. What set this place apart for me was two things...1) the space is pretty nice, a modern upscale sports bar, and 2) they offer a \"prime rib burger\" for a $2 upcharge which was exceptionally good. Dare I mention a candidate for \"best burger\" in Pittsburgh? Yeah, I would say so. For sure."}
{"text":"The pirogies were the highlight of the meal . They were delicious. The salmon and mahi were given rave reviews by my friends . The pork chop also got raves as did the roasted sweet potatoes they came with . My pizza had a good crust but was too salty. My only concern about going back was that it was extremely noisy. Service was very friendly but slow."}
{"text":"I wish i could give this place no stars! we sat for lunch after a lunch rush there were 2 other table in the restaurant besides ours, we ordered a blt with chili and a cesar salad....1 hour latler a stale BLT and chili that looked like it had been sitting there for 2 hours comes out. I was still waiting for my cesar salad. The chili was cold and the blt bread was so hard you couldnt bite into it. When we asked to speak to the manager the waitress got very defensive... the manager came over and explained that is their food and how its made so he wasnt sure of the problem. After an argument going back and forth ensued he agreed to comp the meals. Here is the kicker haha...we were going to leave the waitress a tip because clearly it was not her fault however, she came over and asked if our problem was resolved we said yes and then she rolled her eyes and walked away. No tip for you my friend. This is not how you do business especially when there are other options BESIDES SOHO to choose from for lunch."}
{"text":"This place was a nice venue. The wait ayah was friendly and inciting and my food was tremendously delicious. I'd recommend it to anyone. Only complaint was the amount of time to be seated"}
{"text":"Stopped by Soho for lunch. I ordered a blackened tuna sandwich with the risotto.  The tuna steak was huge and could be a meal on its own. The blackening was not very spicy, but added salt and crunch to the outside of the tuna. The tuna was cooked to medium rare as requested (closer to medium, but still good). The issue was that the blackening did not add much flavor to the fish. The risotto was not creamy like a good risotto and looked like slightly dried out risotto drowned in Parmesan cheese. The food was okay and the portions were huge, but not highly memorable for me."}
{"text":"I got a cobb salad, prior to pirate game, almost no lettuce, chicken had to be frozen and microwaved warm....daughter got buffalo chicken wrap tasted poor, not even my 14 year son would eat it. (He eats anything)"}
{"text":"4th of July... everything is packed so of course there was a wait, for a table of 12.  There really wasn't anywhere to actually wait, and even though many of us ordered from the bar, we got the distinct feeling that we were not welcome to linger while waiting for our table, so we were in the way of the wait staff no matter where we tried to cram ourselves.  

The food was good though.  I had a buffalo chicken wrap and it was good.  However, someone at our table was charged for extra ketchup... what is that about?!  Glad I didn't ask for extra buffalo sauce as usual.  

Despite these issues, we were served in a timely fashion and the food was better than I expected because of the reviews.  It is pricier than it should be for the quality but still better than I expected."}
{"text":"I have mixed feeling about this restaurant. While the fish sandwich and fries I ordered was pretty good, the price and service are what brings this review down in stars. The atmosphere looks more upscale, however since the restaurant is located right outside PNC park, it has multiple tvs and also tries to achieve a sports bar feel. Just for a fish sandwich, I paid $13 and it wasn't any different than one I could have gotten for half the price or at any of the actual sports bars in the area. It was not crowded when we were there, yet it took 20 minutes to get our check and one of our orders came out wrong. Ultimately, I was kind of disappointed"}
{"text":"So when I walked in to Soho last month for happy hour, a person in my party made a casual comment that this place never seems that busy when they walk by it. Little did we know that our group would discover exactly why this is the case during our visit. It's especially noteworthy that I came with a large group that made a reservation with specific instructions about what we wanted. Our evening plans had been made well in advance, and Soho knew - or should have known - exactly how many people would be in our party, and when we would arrive. Most of all, they should have known we had not only asked for a table to be ready, we had asked for water and very specific appetizers to be ready for our group, as we would be hungry after the event we enjoyed before the happy hour. 

Well, as you can probably guess from my rating, making a reservation and discussing and confirming our needs with the staff well in advance made absolutely no difference in the quality of our visit. In fact, I can summarize my entire visit here in two words: we waited.

We waited for them to confirm we had a table after we walked in at 7:15. We waited for the sever to come after they finally confirmed that yes, a reservation had been made. We waited for the server yet again after asking for drink menus. We waited for these drinks, and for water. And we waited for our pre-ordered appetizers. 

Absolutely nothing arrived in a timely manner. In the 35 minutes that I waited with the group, all I got was a water. None of the pre-ordered appetizers even arrived while I was there, and many people waited 10 to 15 minutes for their other drinks. I was honestly astounded at how much the staff missed the mark with our reservations and requests. So I gave up, and left at 7:50 to find a better venue that was interested in providing me with a relaxing Friday night meal.

And all of that was on a night where the place was mostly empty! I can't even imagine what the service must be like if it's actually busy - and I certainly won't be back to find out!"}
{"text":"This is one of those classic scenarios where I'd like to give 3.5 stars... sigh...

Anyway, here's the skinny: SoHo is a great bar to watch games (as mentioned by the other reviewers), an OK place to eat, and the service is fantastic. If it were just based on drinks/service/viewing, I would give it a 4 or 5 stars rating. The food drags it down a bit.

I've been to SoHo about 20 times (as I frequently stay in the hotel above it), and they have a decent beer selection and a very good/knowledgable bar staff. The bar can get extremely packed on game days, as it is literally across the street from PNC Park (and a short walk from Heinz Field). On an off-night, though, it usually has a moderate crowd that trends toward the 30-something \"hip\" groups (it's not a college bar, nor a neighborhood pub).

As far as food, it's really hit-and-miss. Once I had Buffalo Chicken Pierogis, and they were awesome. I've also had a Tuna Steak Sandwich there that was great (if I remember correctly, it had some sort of chipotle or wasabi mustard on it that was yummy). However, as I ate there last night, I saw the lower end of the spectrum. I had a shrimp/scallops pasta dish (Diablo Pasta?), and it was not spicy at all (despite being advertised as such). It was just OK (the ingredients, other than the sauce, were pretty good, but the sauce was just passable). A friend of mine said that the French Onion soup was awful (way too much oregano, he said), and his \"sirloin\" sandwich was not sirloin. So I would just say it's either inconsistent, it has gone downhill, or there are just a few things that they do well.

The service, however, is fantastic. No matter how busy they are, the staff is very attentive and friendly (I've never had to wait long for a beer). I've also had quite a few drinks, over my visits, \"on the house\", which doesn't happen very often anywhere else. They also know a bunch of bartending \"tricks\" that they will do on request (like the Bailey's/Yager \"switching shot glasses\" one).

One last note is that it is usually pretty smoky in there, so be prepared to have your clothes reek after you leave (which, sadly, is the norm for Pittsburgh).

Bottom line: as a bar, 4.5-5 stars... as a restaurant, 3 stars."}
{"text":"Nothing worse than dealing with a customer with a holier than thou attitude as all of us in the service Industry know well. Worse is when you have to deal with someone in the same industry and they have the crappy attitude. So GO SOHO for hiring crappy attitude people in your company."}
{"text":"Went here to watch the College National Champ game.  Was not as crowded as you would think but it was a Monday.  I didn't eat here.  Had a few drinks is all.  Cool place to hang out.  Would like to go here again"}
{"text":"the artichoke and spinach dip was pretty good but on the salty side. My chicken parm sandwich was also really good! The chicken was actually bigger than the bun itself which is always a plus and the spicy fries were aiite. Tried some of moms junkyard dog which was also very delicious! Good restaurant overall"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. Had the Caribbean Salmon salad and enjoyed it. The salmon was cooked as I requested. Greens and veggies were fresh and crisp. I didn't even really need the dressing. Sat in a comfy booth. The waitress was on top of everything.  Lots of TV screens with the Pirates game on. What a relaxing but productive time. My colleague had their burget and fries and seemed to enjoy it.

Followed by another 'dinner' with another couple of coworkers who arrived later and I met them since they wanted to get through some work to prepare for our meeting the next day. Waiter was funny and the vibe was good. We left right before the second rush (post game crowd) came in.

Overall nice place, especially for going there twice in a night!"}
{"text":"We had the sweetest server here - she was super attentive, remembered all of our special requests and even followed up on them to make sure we were happy, and was just a very friendly person to talk to.

The West Coast Burger was surprisingly good and cooked perfectly medium rare. Boyfriend had the meatball sub special which was humongous!

Close proximity to the surrounding hotels which made it a solid place to grab a drink and watch some sports. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Could I give 0 stars,  I would! Went with a group of people before the pirates game, including a few children, waited much longer than we should for non-bar drinks, to place our order, and for the food. We only saw our waitress a total of 5 times before payiing our bill. We had ordered pizza for the children, which was delivered by the manager after the adults were done eating who didn't apologize for the delay, and the server didn't offer anything for the kids while we were waiting. My BBQ burger that was to be med-well was burnt to a crisp and had no bbq sauce on it and came with the toppings I had requested not to have on my sandwich. Then when asked if she could split the checks she said she couldn't do it for a group, before inquiring how many splits we wanted.

I will NEVER return to this location. I've had mediocre service here in the past, and today was the icing on the cake. They claimed our server was busy with other tables, however, there were very few tables left when we finally ordered.

We had allowed more than enough time to eat and make it to the game before the first pitch, and we hadn't made it to our seats until the bottom of the 1st."}
{"text":"Another lunch spot for the northshore.  This probably has the best food.  The french dip and the wraps are very good.  It's a tad pricey but not horrible.  They're really good for pickup.  As is a constant problem on the northshore, service is INCREDIBLY slow.  You won't get out of here in under an hour if you dine in.  The waitresses are just MIA with refills and bringing checks, and the food takes a while to come out too.  But if you have time to spend, it's probably the best lunch spot on the north shore.  If you're running low on time - call ahead and grab it to go."}
{"text":"The location of this bar is great. You are right across from PNC Park. Maybe the best way to review this place is to look at different components:
1. Food. If you want a simple burger or wrap and fries, this place is what you'd like. Prices are really reasonable given the location.
2. Beer selection: nothing spectacular. Stella, Sam Admas, Yuengling, and some others. I suggest that you just have a cocktail instead.
3. Ambiance: Great before a Pirates game. Loud and fun, but not as crazy as some of he bars across the street. You are here to have some fun -- not on a quiet, romantic date.
4. Interior design: Not much to brag about. The restaurant is part of a hotel and is rather bland. 

It's a great place to come with friends and family before a Pirates or Steelers game. I imagine it's pretty dead and boring on other occasions."}
{"text":"The ambiance was adequate, but a bit too loud.  I ordered the grilled chicken parnesan, which was a weekly special, and it was superb.  The prices was appropriate.  Overall, a decent place, but not spectacular."}
{"text":"The good: The location is wonderful. Right across the street from PNC Park, and within walking distance to Heinz Field and Stage AE. Happy hour specials are great (half price appetizers until 7 = wonderful)! 
The bad: The food isn't good; it is mediocre bar food at best. The place lacks any type of energy and the ambiance is flat.
Would definitely recommend Jerome Bettis Grille 36 over this place any day!"}
{"text":"I went to Soho for the first time with four other friends. The restaurant was by no means full but we left unimpressed by our experience.

Several things:
1. Our server accidentally dropped tartar sauce on my friend and I's clothing and on the floor between us. He apologized for the accident several times and offered to pay for dry cleaning my friend's shorts which my friend declined. I did not realize until later it was on my jacket as well.
2. My quesadilla came out with chicken when I asked for cheese only, the server even had clarified that I wanted just cheese. A new one was made. He said the kitchen had accidentally added the chicken. It took about 15 more minutes and my friends were almost done with their meal when I got mine.
3. Our server accidentally dropped something beside me on the floor that ended up splashing something in my eye. He didn't realize.
4. He came back to tell my friend and I that because of the mishaps, we would get dessert on the house. However neither of us wanted them due to dietary restrictions and nothing else was offered.
5. It took nearly 20-25 minutes after that before he came back to give us our check. 
6. He ran my friend's card for the wrong check and didn't realize until he gave out the checks back. Again apologizing and reassuring my friend his card would not be charged twice.

The whole night was almost 2.5 hours due to several of these reasons above. One or two of these incidences would not have been a problem but it just seemed like so many mishaps! The FOH manager never came to check on us after all of this. Although our server was nice, the experience left us all feeling like the customer service was lacking!

Additionally, I had emailed the manager the above experience and never heard anything!"}
{"text":"Good food but takes too long before game to get order, be sure to come early, 35 mins to get food."}
{"text":"Noisy overcrowded and not enough staff to cover the crowd so service was slow. I had to get water for my wife myself.

We had the pretzel with cheese dip appetizer and the nachos, Pretzel was very nice, nachos not so much. The pizza I had was ok even though the crust was charcoal due to over cooking.

Basically only reason I might return is because it's attached to the hotel we're staying in."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times before pirates' games. They have a slightly limited (but still large) menu on game days. Food is consistently pretty good. They have never gotten our order correct, however. Not a bad choice for a game day."}
{"text":"This place is very consistent.  Good food always done and cooked to your preference.  Good service. Sports bar atmosphere.  And room service if you stay in the hotel!  Good deal."}
{"text":"Went here with a couple friends during a conference across the river. Service was typical for a this style restaurant, nothing spectacular.  Half off appetizers for happy hour so I got the sampler (again, nothing spectacular). Decent meal. My friend was disappointed by the his chili and the other did not really enjoy his buffalo pirogies. I might go back if I want some cheap appetizers and a beer during happy hour.  Seating outside was ok at best."}
{"text":"SoHo Pittsburgh. Not SoHo NYC.  Was staying in adjoining Marriott property. Food was pleasant as was the service. Waiter was honest about the mediocre food. Crab cakes have too much filler. coworker had pork chop (seemed smaller than advertised. Dumplings were good. Wings looked okay. One at of our group had the french dip sandwich and liked it.  Deserts were pretty good.  Come with the proper expectations and you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"I was in town for an event at the Warhol museum and this place was a block walk although a long block from my hotel

It was Thursday night and there was plenty of open tables 

Service was quick and the waiter friendly and attentive. 

The back of the menu has the weekly specials. I choose one of those which was a lobster roll. As my side I chose onion rings.  The rings were very good tasty and fresh. The lobster roll was good but had a bit too much mayo for my taste 

My wife had shrimp fettuccine which she said was excellent. It looked very good 

The drink and wine list is rather extensive.  

Overall I thought the food and service was pretty good"}
{"text":"I came here awhile back for lunch after kayaking for a couple of hours.  I ordered the Pittsburgh salad, and it was decent and filling, which is what I was looking for after getting some exercise.  I agree with other reviewers that prices are a bit on the high side, however.  Since I was there on a day when there wasn't a game, there were few other options open either along Federal St. or in the Del Monte bldg.  They have outdoor seating, which is a good way to enjoy the weather on a nice day.  Overall, the food is pretty typical for places along Federal St., but a bit higher-priced."}
{"text":"Had the chicken sandwich,  my sister had the guiltless chicken. 30 minutes after ordering, our waitress came over to ask again what we had ordered because she had forgot to put the order in. Food was flavorless, plain. Was there a few nights ago for drinks after the game, waiter wouldnt allow 3 of us to sit at a 4 top table (but had a party of 1 sitting at a 4 top right next to the table we were going to sit at). Do they even have tables for 3?? 15 minutes later... he asked his manager and allowed us to sit there. Overall, its a close spot to PNC but given both experiences, wouldnt return."}
{"text":"SoHo is always a great place to start out at before heading to a Pirates game, or anything else going on in the North Shore. My networking group had a social here a couple of weeks ago - and it went awesome! We provided appetizers for the group - and they ended up bringing more than what we had ordered as a thank you. Also, we had almost 100 people They sectioned off part of the bar for our group, and were able to accommodate everyone with their drink orders in a quick fashion. They are SUPER easy to work with, and we are looking to hold more repeat events here because of that."}
{"text":"If the place looks busy, then go someplace else. The service staff don't seem to be able to handle a lot of people. Most likely their staff are simply not experienced enough. But if it is not too crowded, then the place is good. Plenty of TVs showing games and a nice big bar."}
{"text":"I stopped eating pretzels for a while in nyc because they were bland to taste as I got older. 
Fast forward and my job sends me to work in Pittsburgh, beautiful city and staying next to this sort of expensive restaurant. 
Appetizers- Pretzels sticks. I was expecting some light bland bs, so I asked for mustard to have with it in advance. 
Turns out they were soft chewy and the best pretzels I ever had. The mustard was the icing on the cake. If you like cheese, well then it comes with warm cheese. Cheese ain't my cup of tea.
Main dinner 1st time was a chicken club, it was good, no complaints.

2nd time - the waitress had the pretzel sticks already being made for my party of four. Wife Right there. We ordered more sticks.
This time I had an Asian chicken salad. It was Aweeeesome. I don't really like dressing. So I mixed it with pretzel sticks and light mustard. 

My party loved their food (Soho Samplers)as well. The pretzels were our weapon of choice against hunger after hard work.

As for my cup of tea I had at the end, it soothed my senses after eating ferociously.

Point blank I miss this place, and the waitress."}
{"text":"My friend Catherine came in from Chicago to visit me for the weekend. After a morning at the Aviary, we stopped here for lunch before heading over to the Phipps Conservatory. I'd never tried this place before, so I wanted to stop in. Catherine was hungry--she said she could have eaten cardboard at that moment and it still would have tasted good! 

Luckily, she didn't have to go that route and the food here was much better than cardboard! 

We began our lunch by splitting an order of Angry Shrimp. Angry Shrimp is very spicy (as its name implies) and is served over chilled pasta. For my main course, the Apple Raspberry Salad sure was tempting, but my blood sugars were running high (I'm a type-1 diabetic) and I already had my carbs with the pasta. I wanted a burger as a second choice, but their burgers are 1/2 pound and I knew I couldn't finish one. Plus I didn't want to schlep leftovers on the bus. So I opted for a Chicken Cobb Wrap, which was tasty enough. 

For the life of me, I can't remember what Catherine ordered, but she did remark that the food was good. She tried the Penn Pilsner beer, which she loved. I don't drink, but unsweetened brewed ice tea with a little lemon in it really hit the spot. 

So the food here is good as is the service. But there doesn't seem to be anything that distinguishes this place from Chili's, Houlihan's, Mex & Erma's, etc. And I wish they'd offer 1/4 lb burgers. Still, it's a good place to go if you're visiting the nearby Aviary, Science Center, the Warhol, or if you're going to a Steeler's or Pirate's game."}
{"text":"Great food and a very cool atmosphere. We happened to go when the restaurant was hosting a party so it was very noisy but I'm told that's not the usual thing there.

The food was fantastic. I was particularly impressed by their dressings. My wife got a Caesar salad and while I enjoy Caesar dressing I don't usually go out of my way to order it. This dressing, however, was really good. The best I've ever tasted. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap, and again, it was the blue cheese dressing that really made the dish. It was a shame that we came on such a crowded day but I'll definitely be back soon to try more."}
{"text":"Wonderful spot for lunch, drinks, and pre- or post-game fun. I've always had adequate, friendly service and great quality food.  My friends/family and I stick to the sandwiches and salads, but they have typical bar and grille fare with a Pittsburgh twist. It can seem a little pricey, but the quality is worth it, especially compared to other restaurants on the North Shore. It can be extremely crowded on game day, so make sure you get there early to get a spot at the bar, high-top tables, or in the dining room. They also have some outdoor seating if the weather is nice enough."}
{"text":"Update:  Went to SOHO Saturday, 5/6/17 for dinner and the TV volume was so extremely high we couldn't? talk and 2 in our party got headaches so bad they couldn't eat their meals.  Major change from our visit a couple years ago!   

Previous Review :  Stopped over before calling it a night after a Friday night Bucco game plus a few stops.  We were very pleased with the relaxing atmosphere.  Music was playing but not nearly loud enough to drown out our conversation.  Took a pizza with us back to the room.  It was good.   Nice stop when on the North Shore!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very nice  really good service at bar.
Had pieroges and French onion soup and they were both very good! The place is adjacent to hotel so very convenient!"}
{"text":"Very good bar in Pittsburgh's North Shore. Nice draft and bottle beer selection. Had a Pittsburgh salad and burger. Both first rate! Great service and a lively atmosphere full of friendly customers enjoying themselves. 

Full menu including steaks, seafood and pastas. Calling SoHo a bar is a misnomber.

There are a few mistakes you can make selecting a bar for dinner in this neighborhood. SoHo isn't one of them!"}
{"text":"Noise level was way over the top.  We had to yell at one another to be heard.  By the time dinner was finished, we couldn't wait to get out of there.  Restaurant was near full but not crowded - 6ish on a Friday evening on a Pirates game day.  Food and service were good after our waitress finally showed up at the table.  Location is great if doing anything on the north side"}
{"text":"We were looking for food late night on Thursday and nothing was open.  Since we were staying at spring hill suites we thought we'd give it a try. We were afraid it would be expensive. 

Flipped menu to sandwiches.  Had a burger or turkey burger or hot dog or chicken sandwich with side for $9-10.

We thought that was good and we had no other late night options.  Food came out hot and fresh. My chicken sandwich was grilled nicely with plenty of juice left in. Homemade chips as side.

Place was large and clean. Pirates out of town so we walked right in at 10am on a Thursday night. Full bar but we didn't order anything."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Spring Hill Suites next door to this place, so we decided to give it a try.  Love the design and interior of the place and they have lots of beers on tap.  Probably is a better bar than it is a restaurant.  The menu has a wide variety of good looking choices.  I simply got a Grilled Chicken sandwich with Swiss cheese and roasted red peppers and mashed potatoes.  It was ok.  The chicken didn't have much flavor to it and it was very thin breast that didn't fit all on the bun.  The mashed potatoes and gravy also didn't have much flavor to it.  My Dad had a burger and he said that was good.  It also took quite awhile to get our food after we ordered, despite it not being busy.  Our waitress wasn't overly friendly.  She was good, but all business, no pleasantries.  If I am staying at this hotel again (not likely), I'll probably eat here if I don't feel like venturing out.  However, I'd probably go somewhere else downtown otherwise.  I wouldn't mind going to the bar sometime though.  It really is a nice looking bar with plenty of seating."}
{"text":"We love coming to Soho. We try to see if you power games every year, and this place is right across the street. There's always a full house of people here. Lots of TVs. A very large bar area. Two hostesses were on duty tonight when we arrived and they were friendly. Our server Sean was very kind and attentive. I forgot to take pictures of our food at the beginning of the meal, but I got a few of the later ones. Restrooms were clean. We love how close it is to the Marriott hotel."}
{"text":"The place is a little noisy and the menu options seemed a bit plain, but the service was great and the food was decent."}
{"text":"Very generic choices - basically bar food.  Definitely not a bad meal, and the fried mac'n'cheese bites were GREAT.  Probably the best I've had (and that includes sheetz late night).  Prices are medium.  

Don't let them seat you in the back room unless you want to eat in a sauna!"}
{"text":"Just walking around the area and ran into this place.  Nice big screen tv's and lots of people.....not over crowded,  no wait. Still took awhile for our food to come out. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and Mr. had the quesadilla and wings. He said the quesadilla was just ok. My wrap was spicy and pretty good. Place cleared out pretty early for a Saturday night.  Overall, service was slow, staff was friendly,  and food was okay."}
{"text":"Working in Allegheny Center Mall, there are not a lot of walkable options for lunch especially if you want something sit down that is a little nicer.  Soho is one of the more popular choices because it is fairly close and has a wide variety of menu items.

The biggest issue is that it is hit or miss on all accounts.  There are times I've gone and service has been exceptional where we were easily in and out in an hour.  There were other times that it was time to walk back to the office and our food had not yet even arrived.  The food quality is the same way.  There are times that everything is perfect and tasty.  There are other times where everything in the order seems to be wrong and taste off.

One downside is the price.  For the type of restaurant it is, the prices seem a bit high.  That being said, it is a restaurant located in a hotel and next to a stadium, so I suppose they may feel justified in their higher prices.

Overall not bad, but it seems like it is better for drinks or appetizers rather then full meals or a quick lunch.  Especially if you are trying to get back to the office or out in time for a game."}
{"text":"We waited forever.
Our food wasn't prepared properly (my husband's salmon wasn't cooked well like he asked. He sent it back and they literally just threw it in the microwave, heating the plate and leaving the inside still not cooked through...).
Our server was overwhelmed (after a Steelers Game, but still... you should be used to this with the location)
Giving a 2-star because my salad was ok, but that's about it. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Terrible. Been sitting at the bar for 15 minutes. Yet to be even looked at by a bartender. Terrible. Not even busy. Not recommended at all!!! Terrible service. Or lack there of."}
{"text":"Nice looking , cool vibe restaurant in down town on North shore of Pittsburgh. Very close to PNC Park....nice to hit the bar before the game with some appetizers. Yummy selections. Open late too!"}
{"text":"So the last review I did on this restaurant a few months ago wasn't too good. I work across the street from here so it is convenient to order from but not necessarily a place I would have normally eaten on my off day. My coworker came back to the office and said that they have a brand new menu so I decided to check it out. I was pleasantly surprised. The menu options all looked tasty. I went with a turkey burger. I normally would have ordered there spicy turkey burger in the past but this was no longer an option. I asked the bartender if I could get there mushroom Swiss burger, but with a turkey burger and make it spicy. She said no problem. When I got back to my desk I opened my to go box and it looked very good visually. It also tastes excellent. Perfectly cooked. Not too dry (like some turkey burgers can turn out) and not undercooked. It also came with fries that were perfectly crispy. So glad I decided to try their new menu. I had my eye on some other menu options for future trips. It's worth the prices now in my opinion. More so than their immediate competitions on the same block."}
{"text":"I went to SoHo prior to a Pirates game. I wasn't going to the game myself, but the menu looked temping and I wanted to try something new so I gave it a shot. With only an hour before game time I was able to find a seat at the bar, but I was was lucky since the place was full. The bartenders were attentive, friendly and fantastic. They really do customer service well.

I had the portabella mozzarella sandwich with spicy fries. The sandwich was super tasty but it was a mess to eat. I ended up using having to give up and used a knife and fork. As a note the mozzarella cheese is fresh buffalo mozzarella not the yellow cheapy stuff.

The spicy fries could be considered their own food group. The spices are similar to those magical sprinkles used at the southern fried chicken restaurant Bojangles. They do leave your tongue tingly. Mmmmm...spicy fries.

You should go."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer after a business meeting.  The server at the bar took the order quick for the first beer but when I finished it I sat and sat and sat.  The bartender was chillin with some friends or just plain ignoring me, not sure but either way I was not getting any service.  I finally flagged down another bartender and asked for my check, she said she would get my server.  I waited another 10 minutes or so and still nobody came to give me the check.  I flagged over the 2nd bartender again (she was the only one responding) and said should I just walk out on this tab to get the attention of the bartender?  After a lengthy wait I finally got my tab and paid but for whatever reason the lady serving at the bar just didn't want to work and now management gets to read this review and decide why they hire people that do not want to sell more product to willing paying customers."}
{"text":"Classy but not stuffy. The music was more dance/pop music than typical bar music, but it was not so loud that it was overpowering. We had a well drink and a draft, which was $12 total. There were quite a few TVs so it would be good to watch a game. We didn't eat, so I can't comment on the food. We sat at the bar and most people there were just drinking. The server was friendly and frequently checked on us."}
{"text":"Came here during winter break with my fam & had a delightful experience here at Soho! The pesto pasta primavera was delicioso and came with bread so that was delightful! My mom got the junkyard dog & she usually never finishes her meals, but she ate most of her dog!! Wowza! The waiter was sort of derpy but nice! Great experience and would definitely come back if I ever come to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"After a long, tiring drive for business, and a wretched checkin at my hotel, I walked over to Soho in hopes of something to abate my hunger and thirst. Seated quickly, Nicki came to offer a drink and my Bells Two Hearted arrived quickly. She took my food order and brought back another Bell's. Shortly thereafter my bone in ribeye arrived. Delicious. Absolutely delicious. And ordered after 10pm. This dinner has saved my wretched day. Perfectly delicious potatoes and vegetables, and there will be no steak leftover. Perfect way to salvage a truly tiring day. I should mention it's also a Pirates home game, so service was stellar. Thank you, Nicki!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time we are in town we stop! The food is fabulous and the prices are fantastic. Located right across from PNC park. There are TVs everywhere and they make sure they have a game on. Also by the way the service is excellent! In the summer and fall we love sitting outside."}
{"text":"Popped into SoHo for a quick lunch after a morning of sightseeing. Of all the restaurants along the street by PNC Park this was the most appealing to us. 
It's a big sports bar with pretty generic decor but it feels light and open and the screens are hung high enough that they don't distract you if you don't want to watch them. The waitress was friendly and service was efficient. Soho has a good range of craft type beers including some locally brewed ones on tap and the food was pretty good overall. It's bar food so it's not going to be the most gourmet thing you ever ate but the gyro plate that I ordered hit the spot. The fries were hot and crispy, the pita bread was soft and fluffy and stuffed full of gyro meat which was very tasty, if a little salty. The salad part of the dish was kind of lackluster but all in all it was a good plate of food for the price. 
Soho is more of a three and a half star place rather than a four star (I'd give it 7 out of 10) but if you want a quick bite to eat in this area it's a pretty good option that won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"We we're not impressed. The prices are high for what is bar food with no real uptake.

Service was neutral both visits (stayed in attached hotel).

Would be willing to grab a cocktail but definitely better options around."}
{"text":"We stopped at Soho for a night cap! We were kind of hungry so we ordered food. Kitchen is open until 11PM. If you like tuna, the tuna melt is to die for! I loved it!!! The firecracker shrimp is fried and the heat comes from a sauce you dip it in. (I don't remember reading that but it was good) Beer was normal pricing. Bar tender was super attentive. I would definitely go back and try more items on menu!"}
{"text":"Great service on a busy game night. They did a great job fitting us in.  The food was great and wait staff very helpful thanks for a great dinner!
Melanie"}
{"text":"I love it here.  Great game day event location.  Great meeting.  Huge bar.  Huge selection.  Not just bar food.  So you will enjoy a dinner.   If you have the munchies it will hit the spot.   Ok do let's do it.  Have some fun."}
{"text":"Stayed @ the hotel. Ordered sirloin steaks. No steak knife, no mashed potatoes, no asparagus as ordered. So, Check your order. I mean for a 2 person $50 meal with tip I would hope the waitstaff would deliver on what was ordered & asked before we left. 

But skip the 20%, $10 room service fee & http://www.sohopittsburgh.com. walk downstairs."}
{"text":"Good food, and good service. My only gripe is that they check you in using \"No Wait\" app, but won't allow you to check in on your own. As season ticket holders, we'd eat here before every Pirates game, but the wait is too long. Every other restaurant on the North Shore allows you to check in via \"No Wait.\" SoHo just makes you wait..."}
{"text":"Omg! This food was great. I especially like the pizza. The prices were average for a sit down restaurant. About $15 per dining experience. The outside seating was small yet comfortable. The bathroom was clean, and my children were accomodated. Ill be back. Get the Pittsburgh pizza!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch before a Bucs game. Great service and food.  Hamburger was thick and juicy cooked perfectly.  Service is excellent.  I can highly recommend SoHo as your pre Bucco stop."}
{"text":"Quick service and seating after the pirates game.  Sat outside because it seemed quieter than the developing bar only scene indoors.  Outside got a lot of car lights in the face, but, food was decent and we were in and out pretty quick."}
{"text":"My wife and I had left the Warhol museum and stopped in for a cocktail. The place was alive with people. Pretty good for an off season Saturday night with the Steelers away. 

We ended up eating dinner and cleaning our plates. Good service. Good food. Good times!!"}
{"text":"Awesome locations! Awesome Tacos!! Little pricey for North Shore (when there are not games or events going on). Lower prices and get better/any deals and you would have more people in. But i like it alot! Would be my go to spot if prices were lower. Went for tacos and 4 drinks $77.  Kinda ridic."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, odd swanky upscale sports bar/restaurant combo, but totally works.  Prices vary from reasonable to ridiculous, steaks are WAY overpriced and not on par with Hyde's down the street.  Firecracker shrimp is yummy, portion is small, not for sharing.  Soft pretzels were disappointing.  The chicken marsala was very good, but not a regular menu item.  Great list of signature cocktails, loved the Pomerita and Strawberry Lemonade Martini.  Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"place was very clean. servers keyed drinks full at all time. food was hot and fast.. prices were good. not from around here and when we walked out of the hotel it was across the street. recommended to anyone...."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend with friends and we went to SoHo for a drink and something to eat. The bar/restaurant is HUGE, which I'm sure is awesome during the baseball season. The waiter was a bit in his own world, but we received pretty good service. The French onion soup had a little too much bread and not enough onions, but the tater tots were awesome (we ordered 3 bowls). This could be a great before/after pre-game spot. It was clean, good atmosphere, and a good spot to hang out with friends"}
{"text":"Ate here twice in one day. Once for lunch and again for dinner. Staying at the hotel and the dining locations nearby, according to Yelp, were less than desirable unless you head across the river to the restaurants there which were rated much better. Didn't feel like doing that so I ate at the hotel restaurant. 

I had a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich for lunch that was just ok. Not recommended since there are so many more items on the menu to choose from. Not sure why this simple dish wasn't better -- you'd think a restaurant in PA would know how to make a decent cheese steak sandwich. 

Had a local seasonal brew that was interesting but wasn't good enough to order two so I followed it with a Blue Moon which is always good. 

For dinner I had some chili which again was good but not great. They cover it in cheese like a French Onion soup which was interesting but the chili itself could have been a lot better. 

I also had a chicken quesadilla which is in the appetizers list but was very good as a dinner item. I'd have that again. Big chunks of chicken and tasty. 

I stuck with Blue Moon for a dinner beer but did get to try another local brew that was really bad. Don't remember the name but I'm glad they let me try it before ordering because I would have hated choking that one down. 

Service at the bar was very good and friendly -- it's a huge bar and usually had two attentive bartenders behind it. Would go back just to hang out and have beers there.

If this were a \"normal\" restaurant, I'd give it only three stars due to the food. But since it's a hotel restaurant, I'll give it four stars, especially when compared to what's nearby. I went into a local bar near the hotel and was ignored until I begged for a draft beer that was served in a plastic cup. There were tons of glass mugs nearby and when I asked for a glass, my beer got colder because of the bartender's cold stare."}
{"text":"A number of the reviews here giving off the \"eh\" vibe? That's because Soho is a kind of \"eh\" place.

I visited for the first time yesterday evening. My boyfriend and I decided to stroll over the bridge to catch some Jazz Live in Katz Plaza (Roger Humphries - really good show) and then headed to North Shore for some grub. Now, I don't find any of the restaurants near PNC to be that good (see my Bettis Grill review) so I knew we weren't going to find anything spectacular. We settled on Soho because I'd never been there before and Atria's doesn't appeal to me.

I did like the open layout on the inside of the restaurant. Looks like a perfect place to catch a game. Finally - a halfway decent TV setup, Pittsburgh! The bar is ginormous and they seemed to have an extensive liquor and beer selection. The draft selection was lacking, but they did have quite a few choices in bottles, if that doesn't bother you. I did not check their wine list, but I know they do have one.

My boyfriend ordered a chicken stir fry and I got a cheddar burger. My first thought: \"These two things should never be on a menu together.\" He said the stir fry was so-so. Ingredients were spot on, but it was lacking any real flavor. Someone mentioned this place as being a runner for best burger in town - huh?? There are a number of places I would put before Soho's: Winghart's, Burgatory, even Olive Or Twist! My cheeseburger tasted like a frozen Bubba Burger from the grocery store (you know the ones ... ). It wasn't terrible perse, but it wasn't particularly good, either. It was just so-so. The cheddar cheese on it was not very appealing - it tasted like one of those individually wrapped Kraft slices. Onion rings were tasty, but I've rarely, if ever, had bad onion rings.

I would visit this place again if my focus were more so on watching a game and drinking than actually eating. Otherwise I say pass. In fact, skip into town over eating in the north shore at all."}
{"text":"The Cheeseburgers were bland, no flavor. I had to douse mine with condiments and salt to eat, I finally gave up. The service overall was decent."}
{"text":"The food quality, taste, and portion size receives more than three stars, but the restaurant has some confused identity in the sense that it claims to be a sports bar, but the prices are equivalent to that of an average restaurant. It's decor is more upscale, but it has TVs spread throughout which counteract the nice atmosphere.  If you are looking for an upscale bar, then this is your place. It's more expensive than most of North Shore and for grabbing a beer before the Steelers or Pirates game, there are better/cheaper options. 

I had the French onion soup and it was good, but our service was terrible. They were understaffed, or the waiter just ignored us, our food order was messed up, and two people in our group had food spilt on them by the staff."}
{"text":"Nice location on federal street. Food was decent, but more importantly was quick. That's important for anyone trying to hot up a game. Prices are high, but cheaper than eating in the stadium"}
{"text":"Stupid high prices for a very small pizza.  When asked how big the pie was they said 8 slices.  I should have asked what's the diameter of the pizza.  At $18 for a personal size pizza it's outrageous.  Skip this place."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and prompt.  Lunch was reasonably priced and served up fresh anf quickly."}
{"text":"My food was plain and boring. Our service was sub-par; we asked for water when we first got there and it didn't show up until shortly before we got our check. The dumb ass waitress spilled water on the floor by our table but didn't bother cleaning it up so when one of the older ladies that was joining me got up she slipped and fell. The manager on duty did apologize, but that was it. There was no offer of a comp or anything and she basically turned around and went on about her business despite us pointing out to her that there was water on the floor that caused the fall. Fortunately no one was seriously injured, but I really don't think that the staff handled the situation with any sort of intelligence or empathy. The place was noisy and it was pricey."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner.. The Chicken Marsala and pasta was very good. My husband had the beef tips and said they were also good..."}
{"text":"Tried this out today to treat the intern for all his hard work. The food was great. And even though our server took forever to bring the food,  check,  or even refill our drinks we still had a good time on our precious lunch venture. It was totally different experience than my Monday experience (when the place wasn't busy). Monday the server (different person) was attentive,  quicks and he at least handed everyone their check instead of handing all the checks to one person. As someone that recognizes great service,  today was not an example of such things. I will say though that they're buffalo chicken is the right amount of spice. Next time I go I will eat at the bar in hopes it doesn't take a decade (exaggeration) to get my food. I'm really interested in trying their cocktails. Their prices aren't that expensive. I got a wrap and fries for ten bucks (win)! If you're looking to eat something and can't find anything good on their menu,  you should just stay home. I really hope the third time makes up for the second and then I can form a solid opinion on Soho."}
{"text":"The dinner-and-a-concert thing was getting unreal last year, but this would be our final outing of 2013. To top off our season of live experiences, we had one more Stage AE show to catch as well as stomachs to satiate beforehand according to protocol. I kept forgetting about a certain North Shore food-and-drink destination named Soho, so with them in mind, Kay, a mutual friend, and myself strolled on over after parking the car to see how they measured up. 

The interiors invoke a noirish urban landscape not unlike Bruce Timm's vision of Batman's Gotham City or the city of Chester Gould's Dick Tracy with a sparsely detailed skyline acting as the focus of the dining room.  Swankiness be damned, our gracious and gifted server Jess treated us like Rat Packers despite our denim-and-band-shirt attire, serving us above average food with agility, style, and congeniality. 

To kick off the meal, our power trio shared a serving of Soho's Thai Shrimp. On a bed of greens and lemon wedges came an octet of plump, reddened sweet/sour prawns that dazzled our palate with their Asiatic/Oceanic blend of sugar, sting, and brine. 

Offering the proverbial \"a little of everything,\" Soho also crafts a fabulous Buffalo Chicken Pizza. It was a must, and in lust I fell, deeply...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnI36r9sdG4

A puffy, doughy, floury, artisan-proud, stone-baked crust held moist cubes of chicken breast, a typically tart tabasco sauce, and a a gloriously glutinous blend of mozzarella and provolone. At 12 inches around, this was a magic carpet ride to pizza pie paradise. 

The Caramel Turtle Bundt Cake was almost akin to a chocolate sticky bun with its adhesive, candied walnuts. A scoop of vanilla cream soothed the heat and richness of this igneous breakfast treat turned dark and inverted, lacerations of caramel amplifying the sweetness with slightly sinister salty bent. 

Soho: Far from So-So."}
{"text":"Did you ever go somewhere and eat something and think, \"Alright, this is good, I'm not blown away, but alright...\"  

Ok, then, did you ever realize, that months later, you're still thinking about something you ate there?  And then you start to think, \"Hey, maybe that was better than ok, since I'm still thinking about it...\"

It's kind of like a movie that you're luke warm on, until you realize that you're still thinking about the movie two days later, and then you're like, \"Actually, I guess the movie was better than I thought, because I'm still thinking about it two days later.\"   

Yeah, this place is kind of like that.  We went there back in October.  We had just driven about 6 hours from Jersey to Pittsburgh, we got in kind of late and hungry, and decided to get something to eat here because it was so close to our hotel (and I did not want to get back in the car and drive somewhere.) 

They had a good drink special (a couple of dollars for a margarita), and we got sandwiches and burgers.  Nothing amazing, but they hit the spot.  But, here's the part I'm still thinking about... they had a special that included the option of sweet potato tater tots.   Sweet Potato... Tater Tots.  Is that redundant?  Should it be Sweet Tater Tots?  I don't know, but I do know they were willing to substitute them with my sandwich even though I wasn't getting the special.  And I do know they were goood.  

So, now I'm a 6 hour drive away, it's two months later, and I'm still thinking about those Sweet Potato Tater Tots.  And, for that, I'm giving this place 4 stars.  

SoHo is really close to PNC Park, and not too far from Heinz Field.  They also deliver (\"room service\") to the two hotels right there, Spring Hill Suites and Residence Inn.  Ask for the sweet potato tater tots.

As for me, I'm left wondering if sweet potato french fries (the more common menu cousin of the Sweet Potato Tater Tot) can ever truly be an adequate substitute, or if I need to go out and buy myself some sweet potatoes and try to tot them myself..."}
{"text":"Stopped by here before a concert at Heinz Field. We had 3 appetizers. The nachos were the worst I've ever had. 7-11 has better nachos. The So Ho Sampler was pretty good."}
{"text":"Soho is right by my office, so I find myself there occasionally. Typically more than intended, and especially when we need a more neutral lunch spot. That sounds cruel, but it simply is what it is: a hotel restaurant & bar.

In the category of hotel restaurants, the selection is wide and diverse, and the quality is certainly better than others. However the price is definitely marked up for the audience (hotel guests have to eat somewhere, right?), and I have experienced issues with consistency.

Faults aside, the locale is convenient, and I do appreciate their diverse selection (some fusion-inspired items, vegetarian options, fun sides, etc.). Make sure to check the back of the menu for the weekly specials. Each week the chef(s) will come up with 5ish unique items. These are certainly the gems of the menu, and often contain ingredients not found in the standard menu."}
{"text":"I love reviews where the folks say hey they were slammed, etc. What do you expect on game day? They're trying to serve as many as they can and still maintain good service. In any case, I ate here twice during my recent visit to Pittsburgh. I had the Tuna the first time and sat outside, although I wished we had sat inside as the seating outside is limited, and I really don't care for people passing directly next to us on the street. The Tuna was excellent; this is a hard to find item as sushi grade. The second time on a game night I had the NY Strip. Also excellent. Good beer selection. The tip on game night is to get there early, NLT than five or so. Otherwise yes, you will be slammed. Service was great from the server, but the hostess not so much. The dining room wasn't close to full and she sat us at the tiniest two-seater table. Before I could say anything she was gone; I just moved us to a nicer table; there was no reason to seat us there. Again, maybe it's a game day thing. The hotel is connected to the Springhill Suites, and they deliver to both Springhill and the Residence down the street."}
{"text":"Came in on Monday for some pre concert drinks and dinner. We were greeted nicely at the door and got sat in a booth, which I love :) our server was Jess, she was very nice and attentive to all of our needs. I was never there before and she helped me pick out drinks from the menu and had great recommendations.  We had Mac and cheese bites as an app, so good!! Then for dinner I had the turkey club and my boyfriend had the buffalo chicken wrap, all very yummy :) she even brought me a small sample of the black bean salad I was wondering about for the sides. The few different people who ran the food to our table were very pleasant also, a very nice staff all around. We had a nice time and would definitely go back again !!! :)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Popped into here after visiting the Warhol Museum. This restaurant is close to the stadium, but fortunately it wasn't crowded. The restaurant is very large and spacious inside. I imagine it gets packed during game days. We sat outside to enjoy the warm weather. I went for the Apple Raspberry Salad. It was crisp, sweet, a bit tangy, and enjoyable.

They have other items on the menu that caught my eye, such as the Jack Mac bites and pizza. Mmmmmmm. But maybe for next time! Good service, didn't have to wait too long. I wouldn't mind coming back... perhaps not during game time though!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. 

Tasty! Chicken cob salad is green, healthy, and very delicious. Any kind of salad is provided with a variety of sauces you can choose and my choice was  blue cheese. It was good. + Chips and soup. I can't remember the exact name of it but it's cool. It was tomato soup with some cheese and you can find it on the top line of soup section of menu. 

Cool! In the middle of the floor there is a great bar. You can enjoy cocktail during even daytime. Mine was beautiful combination of strawberry, perrier and vodka. Again, I forgot . 

Sweet! All of the clerks were so kind. They kept asking me if I need something more in very gentle manner at the right time.  Thanks to their fine manners, from when I arrived and was assured by the waitress to when I payed my bill, I felt comfortable even though I was alone all the time there."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong....   sit at the bar and enjoy some warm Burgh Banter with Donna!   Great place to start before a Pirates game or an outing  to see the Drillers!   Had the Blackened Shrip wrap with a side of Spicy Fries.   Wife had the Black Bean soup and Buffalo Cauliflower appetizer...."}
{"text":"I really like SoHo.  First off, it's located on the north shore and close to everything.  Nice bar, friendly staff, sleek and modern.  Great place to watch a game, LCD screens everywhere.  Skip the other appetizers and start with the angry shrimp.  They do a really good job with a filet mignon.  The salmon picata looked yummy, but since it wasn't mine, I didn't get to taste it.  If you don't want a big meal, they have all the usual sandwiches and burgers.  For dessert, have the banana bread pudding or some yummy chocolate fudge cake!  Or, if you're not feeling fancy, just throw back a few beers and bacon cheddar burger.  It's that kind of place, too."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to start your night off before you head out to PNC. It's right near the park, and they give you coupons to come back after the game for a free miller light...how cool!! 

Service is good, and they serve Leinie's on tap! (mmmmm summer shandy!) I ordered the buffalo potato cheese pierogies, and they were ok. I felt that prices were a little steep, but I guess that's the price you pay for being next door to the ball park, and connected to a hotel."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by before the pirates game. He just got something to drink and loved the beer selection they had. I ordered a jack and coke and the buffalo perogies. Service was fast and prompt and the food was soooo good!"}
{"text":"Hotel restaurant/bars are usually not known for being the best in town.  So when I had the opportunity to eat and drink at SoHo recently, I can not say I was surprised that I found the cuisine to be on the uninspiring side.  Is it terrible?  No,  but you know that better is out there.  

The blackened chicken wrap was boring.  The flavor was missing and the entire meal was just bland.  Also, white tortillas just do not do it for me.  Why does it seem that Pittsburgh wants to thrive on fatty, flavorless food?

Upon ordering the caesar salad on New Year's Eve, I was told that the restaurant has no non- or low-fat dressing option...at all.  However, I can order a salad with FRENCH FRIES on it.  Seriously?  The salad was fine, by the way, and is a large portion but knowing  that tons of calories had to be consumed just to get a vegetable in me was disappointing.

On the bright side, the smoked turkey wrap, which comes with havarti cheese and cranberry sauce was ridiculously good.  The turkey was juicy and melded perfectly with the cheese and cranberries.  That I could eat again and it would  fill me up all day.

I also sampled the buffalo pierogies and really just found them to be the Mrs. T's ones with Frank's Hot Sauce on them.  They were good, but uncreative considering the price ($8.99).

The drinks here are decently priced and pretty good.  Friends I was with sampled a few of the drinks on the interesting cocktail menu and were happy with their choices...they were strong drinks.  When my co-worker and I arrived though one night to dine here, we were not offered cocktail menus so I just stuck with wine until I was no longer in the mood for a cocktail.  

Service on New Year's Eve was apathetic.  Granted, the place was packed, but we had  to wait for silverware and had our food and drinks pretty much thrown at us.  Even when it slowed down we were barely paid attention to and were hardly treated with any amount of friendliness even though numerous drinks and food orders were made.

There are a ton of TVs here, so it is a great spot to watch a game.  Even during busy times, there is a space for you but it will take a while to flag down a server to seat you if you want to sit.  

I think I would stop back here if I find myself at the Springhill Suites again, but I definitely would not go out of my way to dine here.  Can't win 'em all, right?  

Pro-tip:  You can not access the restaurant from the hotel it is attached to (Springhill Suites) without a key and you can not leave the restaurant to get into the hotel without one.  Want some good people watching?  Sit and watch people try to get from one to the other without realizing you need a key.  Ridiculous.  Since you can access each of these places without a key from other doors, this does not make any sense.  But, it is what it is so do not forget your key!"}
{"text":"Meh. 

I always hope for the best. I did not, however get the best. Although I would have to say the pretzel bite appetizer wasn't bad. But I really don't think there's much you can mess up. The buffalo pierogies however, was a total miss. 

I do not want to make any accusations, but they did not seem to be freshly made, maybe frozen pre-made ones. And they were covered in hot sauce. It didn't look appetizing, nor did it actually taste appetizing. 

They have half off appetizer specials for food and $5 drinks. But all the special drinks were mixed, and I knew they would probably be way too sweet and frou frou for me. 

I went with a glass of Malbec, which was a good choice. Actually, it was the best choice there. Maybe stick to beer or wine and you'll be good to go here."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken sandwich for lunch. It appears to have been \"warmed up\" with the lettuce and tomato on it. So, soggy, warm lettuce and slimy, warm (hot house, flavorless) tomato. Plus, loads of \"herbs\" but zero seasoning.  These are basic cooking skills, guys: fresh, crisp veggies & salt."}
{"text":"We were staying in the hotel upstairs, and the options for a late dinner on a cold and snowy Monday night seemed slim, so we decided to head downstairs to the hotel bar. That's just what it is - a hotel bar. Good drink selection, diverse menu options. The restaurant was pretty empty (I blame the cold, snowy late Monday again) but nice to be able to converse and relax after traveling. 

The Honey Barbecue Pulled Chicken was on the specials, and MAN was it special.  I would return for that sandwich if I were in town again and they added it to their regular menu. The flavor was great without being too spicy, but it certainly wasn't bland either. Hands down, one of the best pulled-meat sandwiches I have ever eaten.

Overall, it was a good hotel bar. If we weren't staying upstairs we probably wouldn't have eaten there, but I am glad we did."}
{"text":"I'm staying at the hotel at which the soho is located and I thought it would be a convenient place to eat dinner. Well, it was overpriced and the food was terrible. I ordered the chicken parm pasta and got it to go to my room. The pasta looked and tasted like it was days old and soggy, the chicken was overdone (dry), and the tiny (super tiny) roll was dry and stale. Very bad food and overpriced. Not only was the food a huge disappointment but the bartender who took my order was unfriendly and not helpful. She then began to pour beer from the tap into a glass and sprayed beer on me and didn't say a word, though I met eye contact with her as soon as it happened. She was more interested in talking with the other waitresses.......you know she got a great tip :)

Try another place for food even if you have to step outside of the hotel, there are a bunch of places to eat across the street and at the baseball stadium that is right next to the hotel....Atrias was pretty good and very nice wait staff.

{"text":"Came here with colleagues while in town for a conference and had a great experience. We were staying at the SpringHill Suites attached and since SoHo is attached to the hotel we decided after a long day of talking to people to just go there for dinner. 

We had great service thanks to John P (4 stars) who gave us good recommendations. 
The drinks were good, my Kentucky Mule was strong just how I like it (4 stars).
The food was damn good (overall 4 stars), except the French Onion Soup (1 star) which is awful. 

Chicken Fingers - 4 stars
SoHo Wings (traditional style) - 4 stars
Pittsburgh Pierogis - 5 stars 
Mozzarella Sticks (were really triangles) - 3.5 stars
Tacos - 5 stars
Chocolate Lava Cake - 4 stars
Chocolate Peanut Butter Bliss - 5 stars (get this with a scoop of ice cream)

I'd definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"Nice looking place and the worst service i've had in the last 20 years.   After waiting 10 minutes to have a bartender at a less than half full bar acknowledge us we then ordered and the drinks arrived.  Hope you only need one round because after waiting 30 minutes to try to order a second round we paid with exact change to save us from wasting another hours of our life.   It is hard to explain how oblivious the bar tenders were."}
