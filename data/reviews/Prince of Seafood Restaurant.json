{"text":"Food is good especially the shrimp leek dumplings but the food came out extremely slow. Also be careful that there's a table cloth fee ($1)!!! (Even though there's no tea charge.)"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I last came to Prince of Seafood (at least a year). They have done changes to the restaurant and it now looks cleaner. The food is also better than what I remember, however today the har gow wrapping kept falling apart when we picked them up.  We stopped coming here because my father in law was not satisfied with the food, but now he is very happy with all the improvements, so I will probably be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Prince of Seafood Restaurant sadly is not the prince I have been looking for all these time.

I was even brave enough to go in when I saw that \"Conditional\" Pass sign right at the door. Maybe it was the promise of cheap dim sum that made me walk through the door? $2.10 for every size (S/M/L) on weekdays definitely is a good deal.

The portion is decent as I only need to order 3 items and I was full with some leftover to pack away from snack later.

Chiu Chow Dumplings, Siu Mai and Beef Rice Noodle Roll were all standard. Here at Prince, quantity over quality, as their patrons are mostly seniors citizens living in the surrounding condos wanting to have the best bang for their money.

Maybe when I retired, I will be hanging out here with my friends and feel right at home? But for now, I doubt I will be back!

BTW, their dinner menu is quite interesting with good seafood option: Singapore Black Pepper Crab and lobster for $9.99/lb?!"}
