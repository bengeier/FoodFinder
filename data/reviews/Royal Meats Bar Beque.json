{"text":"great burger joint in the etobs.

not many food options when it comes to etobicoke but this little burger hide-out in the industrial area of kipling is AMAZING.

get the special SPREAD. you will LOVE IT. their meat is super juicy. its clean. open kitchen lets you feel more reassured of your meats. the quality of the meat - from my POV - is great!"}
{"text":"I just had my first cevapi meal here and cannot believe I have been missing this place!  I am always on the look out for these places with my Serb husband, so discovering RM was a treat. Cevapi are delicious, and so were the spreads (kajmak and urnebes). I don't think they are trying to compete with places like Southstreet or Hero as it is a Slavic restaurant, but that being said I will take a burger from Royal Meats any day.  It's authentic and tasty Serbian grill.

As for the service, which people seem to complain about, it really is a cultural thing.  Eastern Euros just don't do the fake pleasantries many of us westerners are used to.  If super friendliness is what you're after with your burger, go to Southstreet and revel in having a smiling 19 year old slather guacamole on your whole wheat burger."}
{"text":"Best place for a group of people dining out. My friends and I generally order the Meat Platter which is around $70 which is good for up to 4 people. Have also had the wings and salads and both are amazing! Great selection of beer!"}
{"text":"Well established place in Etobicoke, really fast and adequate service on the other hand food is really tasty but they must work on their sauces to make the meat better."}
{"text":"This review will be short and to the point. 

The burger was good but they have very few toppings in comparison to hero and southstreet burgers. 

The lady taking our order was rude, cold and seemed very annoyed that we were ORDERING!  

The coffee and crepe was awful!  Just like my experience here!  If this place can take 1 thing from McDonalds, it's that smiles are free."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. The meat appears to be fresh, not frozen. They do sell some frozen meat that you can take home though. 

There is some free parking, some indoor seating, and a  small outdoor patio. The interior is very nice and comfortable.  

The menu items look so good that we had a hard time choosing. 

The toppings are also excellent, try the house sauce.

Onion rings were also delicious, but seemed to be a bit overpriced for the portion.

They also have some coffee and dessert items, but dessert selections are limited.

This is a must visit on this side of Toronto, and one of my favorite burger joints in Toronto."}
{"text":"The price point at this establishment is a little high. I have eaten here twice but no longer. First time I ordered a salad and it cost around $14 dollars. The second time I ordered a chicken sandwich and cucumber tomato salad. The salad was good. I don't know what they do with the chicken or the house spread they use on the bread but I have never in my life had a sandwich that was as salty as this one. It was disgusting I had to eat in intervals. So much sodium can't be healthy at all."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, each time was pretty good, but not like blown away good. The burgers are big, but not super moist. I like the house sauce they use. They have re-done the restaurant and it looks great. I would probably come back again in the future since I live in the area, but with many great burger places in the city now, there are many other options."}
{"text":"Dieses Restaurant hält was es verspricht: Royal Meat. Vor allem Steak Burger (CAD 12) ist ein echter Fleischberg, den man erstmal irgendwie bewältigen muss. Gute Salate (Garden Salad, CAD 4 oder Shopska Salad, auch CAD 4). Man wird satt und wird gut und freundlich bedient."}
{"text":"Good food, HUGE portions, clean interior/patio, limited beer/wine selection and casual dining. The staff is a TOTAL MISS; otherwise I would have given it 4 stars. Customer service is key when you want repeat patrons (simple please/thank yous, go a very long way) and try to get to know the ppl in the restaurant (felt unwelcomed). Don't kid yourself, this is a Fast Food place that serves alcohol."}
{"text":"We ordered four burgers to go. It was only a 5 minute drive home but when we got home the burgers were very soggy and it tasted so bad. We paid $45 but we didn't even eat it. All of our money and the food went to waste."}
{"text":"My review is for their take out.  We've seen the place as it grew over the years from a small place to with an extended front patio to another side extension for more indoor seating.  It's great to see growth with an original small business so bravo!  We hadn't gone in a while but I was remembering their great bbq meat one day and we were having guests come over.  One of them was a meat lover so we decided to do their take out.  The food arrived within the hour and was very impressively packaged.   A nice sturdy logoed paper bag and lots of plastic cutlery.  The meat platter was a lot!  The salad we ordered was fresh and the grilled veggies were very tasty.  My daughter who does not eat much eat was just gobbling up the Chevaps.  Also the fries were crispy, not soggy.  Would definitely order again for my self or as for entertaining."}
{"text":"The food: its not bad but not great i would say its an average joint and a bit over priced.  the bun is a bit tough ... i prefer a softer bun for my burger but it was still a good bun.  over all good quality meat nothing really special.

the service there is horrible - people that worked there in general were just really grumpy.  would i try it again ... most likely not."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time wife my wife last night. The food was ok, and the service was terrible. Not that waitress wasn't friendly, she was just so nonchalant about everything. No water for the us. We had to ask. Patrons should never ask for water! We ordered some garlic bread as an app, it came at the end of the meal. The food was messy and she only gave us the napkins that we're already on the table. The burgers was ok. Fries? Meh! Definitely will not visit this place ever again!!! Not a chance!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived to the place.  Its a noce decorated place.  We ordered chicken fingers for our toddler which were very good.  We ordered some trial wine, most of them were too smooth to drink with meat.  Usually we like to drink a stronger wine when eating meat.  The selection wasn't broad enough.  They should have some additional wine selection, such as Californian; Chilean and Argentinean.  

The worst part was that when our meat arrived (which comes with a side of salad) the salad had a hair.  They changed it immediately, but it was kind of disgusting.

The temperature inside of the place was very hot.  I thought it was just me, but my boyfriend told me the same.

The meat (we ordered the NY Steak) was good quality, maybe too seasoned for my taste.  Other than the salad, it came with french fries which were very good.

Service was \"ok\". 

I ordered dessert which was a nutella crepe and it was good.

In general I can't give the place over 2 stars until they improve the restaurant temperature, food in general, wine selection and service.  I thought this was a high end meat place and it should have everything accordingly."}
{"text":"All of there meat is high quality and worth the wait. The only thing they can work on is there customer service and maybe renovate the inside a little bit to make it more visually appealing. But other then that amazing food!"}
{"text":"If you havent triwd this place you need to know your missing out.  Im here atleast 3 times a month."}
{"text":"We pull up to Royal Meats and all the logo and space reminds me of a Rolce Royce dealership with the big capital \"R\".  I also quickly notice that there's a gym across the street so perfect to work off your guilt.

Royal Meats bills itself as fast food with a European touch which is reflective of it's food, the servers all speaking different Eastern European languages and of course you can feel it in the atmosphere; inside with the locals chatting in different Balkin dialects and outside on the patio where you can hear faint Euro beats from cars in the parking lot. 
Let's talk about their burger - the meat patty is a mixture of pork and beef and is all grilled to order.  They also have a wide variety of items for the adventurous and the typical grill offerings.  I decide to try something different and order the cevapi sausage-shaped meatballs made of pork and veal and seasoned only with salt and pepper. 

When choosing your 'burger', you have a choice between the 1/2lb or full lb-  get the 1/2lb and that is more than enough, trust me!!  
The thing that got me was the incredibly flavourful and colourful spread they schemer on your bun, called urnebe which is made from roasted red pepper, cheese and onion.  They even made it spicy for me by throwing on additional chilli flakes.  
Now get yourself a bunch of napkins because not only are these burgers humungous but they are sloppy to eat and they are piled high with toppings!!  They fall apart, your garnishes fall out and sauces drip everywhere but it is truly one of the best, if not the best and most unique burger i've had!"}
{"text":"i've been to a lot of burger joints around town and this is the only one where the burgers tastes like the best sausage you've ever had!!  the price you pay is more than you would have to lay out going to a regular fast food joint but it's so worth it!!  you can watch your meat being cooked as the grill stands out so large behind the counter with the smells of goodness invading your lungs!! even the chevaps are wicked!!"}
{"text":"...where to begin. We had the burgers. Specifically the Royal burger - the frontrunner on the extensive menu and presumably a dependable barbeque staple. Not at Royal Meats, however, where the Royal is not a burger at all but an impostor; a suspect, grey, institutional mixture of what tastes like heavily peppered pork with a healthy side of gruel. Served on a quickly disintegrating interpretation of a ciabatta bun the allegedly 1/2 pound patty is dwarfed by the toppings and the bun. You might perhaps have ordered a side of the house salad - allegedly \"...just like a greek salad\", except without any dressing and with an extra portion of hard tomato cores, white onion and past-due lettuce. Oh, but there's a sprinkling of feta as consolation for having endured the glacially slow service and surly demeanour of the staff. I have had better burgers in hospital cafeterias, and certainly more cheerful service. Go to Apache burger, or the cafeteria at Trillium."}
{"text":"Came here years ago when it was mainly a take out spot. Love the addition of the restaurant! The service was absolutely amazing and the meat platters, charcuterie board and salads were delicious. Great place for a group."}
{"text":"After hearing some raving reviews from others in the neighbourhood, I was anxious to try this place. But sadly, I was disappointed, and found it to be vastly overrated. Driving up, I was initially impressed with the decor and cleanliness of the place... until I made a visit to the ladies' room, where I was actually a bit disgusted - it didn't feel clean at all, and I always go by the principle \"if the public spaces aren't clean, imagine what the back rooms are like\". No soap to wash my hands, either! (And I'd say that's pretty important before you pick up a burger to eat it!).

I was completely disappointed by the burger - no one explained to me that it was not beef (I should note that the menu board was not working correctly, so perhaps if it had of been, I would have figured that out in advance?) - and so while I was eating it, I was trying to figure out why my hamburger had such a white-ish/pink-ish tinge to it. I only NOW understand that it was not beef after reading some of the other online reviews. I suspected it might have been pork, but how would I have known that it was a pork/veal combo?

I was surprised to find that there is not an option to get cheese as a topping - but I did actually enjoy the sundried tomato and cream cheese spread. The bun was also quite nice. But I had a hard time enjoying the meal, considering my unclean hands, the mystery meat, and knowing the price we'd paid. 

I won't be rushing back!  Instead, I'd rather have Gourmet Burger Co."}
{"text":"Located at the corner of north queen street and kipling this restaurant is a good distance for anyone on the west side of toronto. It is worth the drive for anyone anywhere else. They make some of the best hamburgers i've ever had. They have hamburgers, pork hamburgers, chevpas hamburgers."}
{"text":"I like that you can pick your meat. We always get the \"chevaps\" to get a more authentic experience since you can get a regular burger elsewhere. The chevaps sandwich is darn good! It's big and sloppy with lots of toppings.

Major downside is the price. Our half pound chevaps was $8, a steak sandwich (alone, no combo) is $15! We got a side of onion rings for $4 and there were LITERALLY 5 onion rings. What a rip off!"}
{"text":"Original burger place. Order your endless choice of meats from a cold display case with them on display. Great fries, this place deserves a visit."}
{"text":"To the point review in the style of the good, the bad, and the ugly. 

Good
-nice modern decor, mix of seating, patio in the summer 
-easy to find location - right off of Kipling ave 
-chicken breast sandwich - good not over cooked
-house prepared roasted red pepper sauce
-fresh toppings
-organized ordering system with a pager
-fresh Kaiser Bun
-friendly service

Bad
-taste of the burger; ordered a 1/2lb Royal Burger. Just not doing it for me they use a combination of beef and pork for the patty.
-tad over price avg $8 per person per sandwich , so by the time you get a drink and side it's $20+ for fast food
-tables need to be clean up more frequently, tons of cracker and bread crumbs on the floor. they give you real ceramic dishes to eat from so patrons leave them on the table after they finish. no place to put the dishes by the trash. 

Ugly
none

There are many independent BBQ establishments to choose from in the West End. Royal Meats is one of them. It's a nice looking establishment with an organized ordering system but it misses the mark for me in the taste of their specialty the Royal hamburger. The chicken sandwich was okay though."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here last night! My friend had the burger with goat cheese added on, and I enjoyed the chevaps sandwich, with garlic fries on the side. Both meals were great (especially with the house sauce), but the service was what really made our meal. Our server, Ana, was very attentive, helpful, and genuine, and we were so impressed by how welcome she made us feel. We will definitely be back & recommending, thanks Ana and Royal Meats!"}
{"text":"I have been to Royal Meats more times than I can count, and every time I have had a pleasant experience. Yeah, the servers aren't super friendly or smiley, but they are pleasant enough and have never been rude to me, so I have no complaints. 

Now, I don't particularly enjoy burgers, but for some reason I really like Royal's burgers (Pljeskavice), and I actually like the fact that there isn't a huge assortment of toppings - the toppings you do find are the classic Serbian stuff like Ajvar (roasted pepper spread) and Kajmak ( a type of fatty cream cheese that is absolutely freakin' delicious). 

When choosing a burger, you have a choice between the 1/2lb or full lb. I always get the 1/2lb and can barely finish it. You have the option of making your meal a combo with a choice of either regular or Sweet potato fries, or salad. I usually get the Shopska Salad which is traditional Serbian salad of cucumber,tomato,onion and feta. Fresh and yummy. Sometimes I get the sweet potato fries, and they are equally delicious. 

My Serbian bf introduced me to this burger joint years ago, and its his favourite place to come for some traditional Serbian Cevapi (ground beef and pork sticks), grilled pork or Pljeskavice . I have liked everything I have tried from here, but I always come back to my 1/2lb burger - its really flavourful and juicy. 

This place is definitely worth a try if you are in the area, and craving a fresh and delicious burger or Cevapi."}
{"text":"First time diner at Royal Meats, and I'll start with Not bad!

When we pulled into the parking lot the building itself just screams Modern and I immediately knew I was going to pay a little more to eat here.

This is an interesting place as it is caught between fast food and fine dining, When you walk in you have the option to stand and order off a menu on the wall, or be seated in the dining room and served. For this day as we were in no rush decided to sit.

Great menu, with some very enticing items on it. We were having lunch so I went with the Royal Burger, and chose the large portion size. However when the burger arrived i immediate questioned my decision. Let me clarify it looked fantastic, however it was MASSIVE. MY friend explained it was a 1LB patty, and every bit of that pound was laid out in front of me. 

Flavour wise, it was surprisingly good. Juicy, some decent flavours, and a great feta spread was placed on the bun. It didn't stand out by any means as the best burger i have had but it was good. A little refinement could elevate it to a stand out level. We shared an order of fries with the meal, and those were very good.

The service was fine, quick and organized which is what i expect when i sit down.
Interior was very well done and nicely thought out.

The reason for only leaving a 3 star is a bit of what i just mentioned, 
1) The sit down vs self order options added some initial confusion I think a place like this needs to commit to one or the other. Based on the style of the place to me it would have been as if there was a take-out window at the keg.
2) Food was good - however portion size was a little overkill. With that i felt they missed an opportunity to enhance flavour.

In the end, would I return. I would!!!"}
{"text":"I had the cevapi here recently and they were okay, but very over priced. The service was slow and I had to wait long for my food. 

In comparison to other places I have gone to with similar food, I probably would not come here again. I prefer the cevapi at Croatia Restaurant in Mississauga if I want a fancier dining experience and better service. Mrakovic is also good for takeout cevapi (it is a deli with a small cafe in the back). I also like Berina's specialty in Mississauga, since they are reasonably priced and their cevapi taste more authentic.

Overall, I think this place is over rated and I was disappointed with the prices and service. You can find better Bosnian or Eastern European food at many other restaurants and take out venues for a better price."}
{"text":"I'll be quick...

Cleanliness 8/10
Service 6/10
Hamburger 7/10 (seemed under cooked)
Fries 7/10 (were cold)

A little over priced!!!

I will try again and try something different..."}
{"text":"Great place!  Expansion is great. If you get the right meats, it's fantastic. The additional stuff they added to expansion menu not great but stick to what their specialty is and you'll love it!"}
{"text":"When it opened this place was amazing, but things have slipped. My regular chevaps took 15 mins to prepare at 1:30pm, despite a largely empty restaurant. I got three tiny overcooked, dry breakfast sized sausages on a huge bun. The house sauce, who was once a unique  flavourful treat was completely  bland and unseasoned. For $12, no drink or side, you have to provide more to keep the customers coming. Looking at the largely empty parking lot, perhaps others agree."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend who suggested we try this place out. My friend was raving about the food. Nice ambiance. We got the meat platter for 2-4 ppl for $75. The server, Nikki, was really patient with us and took her time answering all our questions. Food I would give 2-3 stars, nothing to write home about or may not come out of my way to re-visit. But the service made up for everything hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Meats galore! From fish to chicken wings to steak to chicken kebabs, this place has it all. We've come here twice and have been able to try a few things out. The ribeye steak and seabass are decent. But the chicken shishkebabs are a must-try!They are skewers of chicken breast filled with ham and goat cheese. Yup, it's as good as it sounds! This place also has a nice patio if you're looking to grab a few glasses of wine and sit outside."}
{"text":"I was utterly disappointed with my visit to Royal Meats.

Although the place is supremely clean and contemporaneously furnished to the nines, it was the food itself that makes me shudder every time I drive by.

I went in hungry enough to eat a side of beef. Their menu offers a simple range of choices, all clearly posted with nice photos of each. Their menu choices are 

Royal Burger
Chevaps
Steak Sandwich
Shish-Kabobs
BBQ Chicken
Grilled Pork
Smoked Sausage
Royal Cannon

My wife and mum in law opted for the grilled chicken sandwiches (as they're not keen on pork nor veal and that's what the hamburger patties are made of), and I decided I had to attempt the Royal Cannon based of my aforementioned hunger.

The Royal Cannon is a gigantic, rolled piece of veal, filled with cheese, battered and deep fried. I know... gross eh? But I was starving!

I'm constantly saying \"We don't have places like the ones you see on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives here in Toronto\". I thought this Royal Cannon was about to change that.

Two-bites in, I felt sick to my stomach. The cheese inside bled out of the grey, rolled meat into an oily pool on the plate. I have no idea what kind of cheese it was because it was incredibly oily, strong in flavour and rich. Waaay too rich. I pushed the $16 piece of garbage to the side and continued with my sweet potato fries, which were good. My Cannon was served with some sort of European bun. I took a bite. The texture was amazing, soft and dense... great flavour too! I took another bite and spit it out. Inside the bun was slathered (and I mean slathered), some sort of weird cheese mayo which tasted just like the innards of the Cannon. Blech. Back to the fries.

My wife and mumsy in law felt sorry for me and offered me parts of their chicken sandwiches. I them up on their offer. Dry, pallid and boooooring. Nowhere near to anything that should be labelled as BBQ.

It is my new belief that there should be a law governing establishments that use the term BBQ, or any derivation of it, in their title. Churrasquieras are not BBQ. Korean grill houses are not BBQ. And Royal Meats is NOT BBQ! (1)

I will not be back to RMB... but I hear there's an award-winning burger spot just up the road  that I'll be sure to try.

{"text":"Another spot on my list of places I've visited on more than one occasions and somehow forgotten to review - you'd think wouldn't be that difficult but it really is to remember all the places you go every week!

Royal Meats has been a part of the south Etobicoke community for years. In fact, it actually started out as a balkan-butcher shop in Mississauga before turning is meaty success into a sit-down restaurant. I'm not sure if the butcher shop is still around in Mississauga (I think it is) but the restaurant, while having a butcher style counter in their front entrance showing their fresh meats, does not allow you to buy raw meats (except for chvaps).

It's a great looking spot inside and out but being on the cusp of an industrial area it does look out of place as it has the modern familiar aesthetic of a trendy chain (Moxies, The Keg, Joey) which stands out amongst the industrial strip mall plazas that surround it.

In my experiences here I've yet to come across a staff member here without an eastern European accent, so either it's one big family working this place OR (and more likely) it's a spot that attracts that community which is certainly in abundance in Etobicoke. One positive about the staff being mostly eastern European young ladies is they're all gorgeous. I don't mean that in a creepy \"check out dem hot chicks at Hooters\" shade, no. I mean strikingly beautiful (complimentary... not creepy, fellas).

As I mentioned Royal meats started out as a butcher shop and they haven't forgotten their meat roots. The menu is definitely not for friends of the veg, I mean you can likely find something to eat, but let's face it this place is all about the meat. You can order a variety of Balkan-inspired items but you'd be remiss to not have two things here, a) The burgers - which are massive, and b) the Chvaps. OMG the Chvaps are amazing!

To explain what a Chvap (fully named Chvapi, pronounced Chee-vap-ee) is, it's basically high-grade hamburger ground meat mixed with a special blend of meat/fat/herbs/spices and formed into the shape of a ground beef breakfast sausage and then grilled on an open flame. You can order chvaps in a few different kinds of meat (pork, beef, veal, lamb) and have them as a starter on a plate or, my preference, is they pile a bunch inside a giant bun, and dress it like a burger.

Honorable mention goes to the steak sandwich because it's essentially a FULL STEAK on a bun. We're not talking a thin grilling steak, no sir, this is a 1-1.5 inch thick 10oz NY striploin on a bun for only $20!!!!

The burgers and onion ring towers are also menu stand outs BUT my bucket list item here is to do one of their meat platters with a bunch fo friends. Depending on the size of your group they have a meat platter to serve you, the largest and most expensive is the MEAT PLATTER 4
which can serve about 20-25 people. It costs $390.00 and comes with 40 chevaps, 10 small royal burgers, 10 chicken breasts, 20 shishkabobs, 10 smoked sausages, 4 royal cannons, 20 lepinya buns and 4 portions of french fries. They also offer seafood platters which are equally impressive - check the website for full deets.

I honestly can't say enough good things about this place, it's not the healthiest choice for me right now but it's definitely a treat every month or two.

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Walking into Royal Meats Barbeque was a welcoming treat with a full staff smiling and ready to take my order. I stood there a moment gawking at the giant chalkboard menu trying to digest some of the items including a $799 meat platter, say whutt? and trying to put my finger on what set this place apart from other typical suburban strip mall burger joints. I finally asked for a burger with onion rings because, well, onion rings are the best when they are home made. Only after reading some of the other reviews did I realize the Eastern European or Serbian influence on this licensed establishment. I didn't have a beer, but their selection looked very interesting and the bar was well stocked as if they could host a boisterous wedding without a hitch.

The burger was quite good and very out of the ordinary, at least compared to the typical gourmet burger that I've been enjoying lately in the city. The meat was seasoned and not greasy, and more on the dry side, but very good. And the bun was exceptionally good with a chewy texture and it had a hearty grainy structure to it along with a unique flat shape, very unusual and delicious too. The toppings were ordinary except the barbeque sauce which was an interesting orange colour and had a great undertone and kick to it. The onion rings were crunchy and dry with a thick seasoned coating. They had the rings piled on a skewer (kind of a theme it seemed) which looked very appetizing, but exposed them to the surrounding air which cooled them more quickly than I liked so I devoured them. They give you a choice of ketchup or mayo as a compliment alongside the rings. I think I'll have to return to try some of the Serbian treats sometime."}
{"text":"And I'm being generous.  

I understand there's a wait.  But 40 minutes to grill some meat?  I understood there would be a wait - hence why they give you those pucks...but after 30 minutes, I had to say something.  The young girl first said \"oh, it takes a while to cook tilapia\".  I just smiled and said \"30 minutes to grill tilapia?\"  She admitted she forgot to put in my order.  She offered a slice of cake.  No thanks.

I also ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, which was disappointing.  It must've been sitting in the box before she gave it to me because it had cooled off...no longer warm or juicy, and there wasn't much chicken in it.

The 2 stars is earned simply for the tilapia.  Very good portion, nice and flavourful."}
{"text":"went to royal meats yesterday for lunch. it was my first time there, as a friend of mine recommended it because we were in the area and hungry.

somehow we got there in between the waves of customers, because there was no line, and the place was only about half full. however, during our mean, the place jammed out... and quick. 

royal meats has an interesting setup. they have a display counter like a butcher shop, that contains the various meat  they have to offer. everything from shish kabobs, chicken breasts, sausages, regular sized burgers, and the previously mentioned 1 pound burger patty. i like this touch. it allows customers to clearly see the quality of the meat.

most of the reviews on here talk about the lack of condiments, and its true. but in my opinion, a good burger should be simple, and not have all this other/random toppings that drown out what the star of the burger should be.... the meat. so for me, lettuce, tomato, onion is good for me. 

i had ordered the regular burger, and was not blown away... but thought to myself 'ok... this is a good burger. i would come back next time i'm in the area'.... i have a feeling that the patty consisted of beef and a little pork which gave it a nice flavour, but i like i said, it was a good serviceable 13 dollar burger (with the combo).

there are better burgers in the city... but if you happen to be in the area, and don't want to eat an IKEA hot dog, check out royal meats."}
{"text":"There are a lot of firsts you remember. Eating my first Royal Meat 1 pound burger is definitely one.

Royal, aka \"Where the Burgers are,\" nicely blends an upper class dining experience with a casual 'serve yourself' atmosphere. The decor, the quality of the food, the prices are all high-end. Yet you walk up to a counter, order from a menu board and the staff dress your burger in front of you. Don't let this detract you from what will be one of the best hamburgers you'll ever eat. 

Plus, the sides are great too (highly recommend the sweet potato fries).

It is a touch more expensive than you're average burger joint, but this ain't your average burger, I mean you can literally pick your piece of meat before they put in on the grill - sort of like a lobster tank."}
{"text":"So good! Hands down the best burgers I've had! Although it can be on the pricier side, the portions are definitely more than filling and the flavours are great! It's an amazing sit down restaurant and also good for take out. The Yam fries are the best!"}
{"text":"I must have passed by this place 100 times always telling myself I need to stop in there and try their food. Finally a couple of weeks ago my wife and I stopped in, wanting to see how it fared versus Gourmet Burger which opened just a few blocks north not so long ago. Love their logo, their decor outside looks super cool. Inside I noticed the LCDs they were using for the menus were crooked in their frames, not sure if they've fixed them since then, but I thought it was a bit odd considering how upscale the place looked from the outside. 

Anyhow, what I really care about is whether the food is up to snuff. The portions you get here are amazing for the money. The fact that you get to see your meat before they cook it up, let's you know how fresh it really is. My grilled chicken burger was delicious, a juicy and moist breast, topped with crisp veggies. My wife really liked her 1/2lb burger. We also ordered a side or regular and sweet potato fries. We didn't realize how large the servings were going to be, we could've just ordered the one to share. Their sweet potato fries are the best I've had so far.

Definitely a great place to stop and get a bite when you're in the area, this one is going into our regular rotation."}
{"text":"This place hits the spot every time. They are so good at what they do, making traditional Serbian food that it brings back so many wonderful memories of home. The meat is proudly displayed in the cafeteria section of the restaurant, and you get to pick your cut, size, preparation method, etc. The freshest meat in town. The sit-down part of the restaurant is really beautiful, lots of shiny lights and beautiful wood and leather throughout. Same great food, and really excellent service. 

Go. Go now. Get the chevaps, or the Royal Cannon. Amazing."}
{"text":"Being Serbian, I definitely know my cevapi, pljeskavice, ajvar, etc...

Their cevapi are awesome. Ajvar (roasted pepper spread) is to die for. Pljeskavice are pretty good, too. I haven't had any of the chicken or \"generic\" stuff, so I can't really comment on it.

Takes a little long for the food but they grill the meat fresh so I'm definitely not complaining. A little pricey but totally worth it for some extremely filling Serbian classics.

The staff might come off as a little rude, but that's typically how eastern Europeans come off, so don't take it to heart.

Will definitely return and highly recommend this place (if you're not in a rush)."}
{"text":"First time at this place around the corner from work. First appearance is excellent, service was not very appealing and the food was mediocre at best. After standing reviewing the menu I asked if you sit anywhere and was told that self serve is on the end of the counter, I assumed that meant there were no wait staff but there are. I ordered my food cheesburger, fries and I asked if they had a side ceasar salad size, they said yes. So with a drink that came to $26. I recieved my burger with all the toppings I asked not to have and the sauce contained lots of onions, which is one topping I asked not to have. After sraping off the toppings I had a bun that was soggy and 30% larger than the bland burger inside. The fries were average. The salad was mad by a lazy prep chef who couldn't be bothered to make the lettuce bite sized, so after cutting my salad I found it underdressed and rather sour tasting. Dont think I'll be back"}
{"text":"I'm being generous because they have great frozen glasses, but to have a limited type of beer and charge $8.00 a beer you have to wonder . The food is good, but in the real world they use inexpensive cuts of meat. So you choose, frozen glasses, small real estate, and hyped up meat. Personally I get pissed off at being charged $8 for a beer, and compromising meat."}
{"text":"the food was pretty good for the price, and came our WAY quicker than I thought which was awesome. I was hoping for a little more selection on the menu, but the taste of the food kind of made up for that. the waitresses we dealt with were beyond helpful and kind, and took the experience over the top."}
{"text":"I stoppedby Royal Meats (an out of the way location, for me at least) to try the alleged \"best burgers in town\" as recommended by my friend Jeff M.  I had the 1/2 pound royal burger.

I'm a fan of cooking burgers on a flat top, rather than a grill, so that you get that nice crust on the burger... but that's just me.  The beef was moist, but the bread was plain.  The best thing about the burger was the toppings... they have this roasted red pepper sauce that is awesome.  If you go here, definitely get the roasted red pepper spread on your burger, and some on the side too :)  I'd come back for the roasted red pepper spread alone, if I'm in the area. 

The price point is a bit high for what you get imo, considering your in etobicoke.  Also, be prepared to wait. I came after the gym and I was starving, so having to wait 20-25 minutes for my burger did not make me too happy. 

All in all, my friend is wrong; it's not the best burger in town. IMHO, that award still goes to Burger's Priest.  But, it's a decent burger with great toppings which you won't be unhappy with."}
{"text":"I've come here many, many times and the food is always great! A lot of my friends recommended I order the Chevaps and that is exactly what I did! 
I got the Chevaps and their house salad and it was delicious and definitely hit the spot. 
This place is pretty pricey and the service was okay that is why I give this place a 3.5."}
{"text":"On first sight this burger joint looks like a place you want to become a regular at, once you get inside and get a feel of the place things change. Well, they changed for me at least. 

As mentioned by someone else, the service is pretty horrible, no one seems interested in working there or at least putting in an effort to recall the ingridients you ordered for your burger, I'm not even asking for a smile here, which as expected I did not get. 

In terms of the food, the meat was great. I found the toppings to be straight to the point. However, I did enjoy their assortment of spreads, like their sun dried tomato cream cheese. 
The best part of my meal were the sweet potato fries, just because I at least had the option to order them. 

The location is bad, and although it has a patio you will taste more dust than your actual meal."}
{"text":"When you are about to head into Toronto from Etobicoke, and need a solid base for your adventures - well, you can thank me later. 

Royal Meats, AKA the Butchers from Bosnia - just fantastic quality meats, as you would expect from a restaurant that descends from a butchers shop.

Go with the Chevaps, or the burger - the Royal Cannon if you have the iron gut. The bread also stands out as quality.

You pick out your cut or sausage or patty, and its off to a huge central grill, lovingly cared for by Eastern European kids who will likely be beaten by the owner if they hand over a sub-par plate or sandwich. 

Not the fastest, not the fanciest (ByMarks!), but I find myself heading there every time work brings me to Toronto."}
{"text":"being from etobicoke, this is a go-to take-out place.  we've tried the royal burger, chicken, chevaps, steak.  all are very good and decently priced for the pounds u get.  you can choose btw 1/2 to 1lb sizes. make sure you get their special sauce - a mix of feta cheese, red pepper and spice.  enjoy there or take-out.  they serve alcohol so sometimes nice to just stay in.  only thing is, some times the saltiness of the meat fluctuates - so perhaps have the sauce on the side and get less toppings.  overall, a good burger, flavourful, and unique sauce.  again, it's usually our go-to place when we want to take-out."}
{"text":"Chevaps sandwich was pretty good but it is way overpriced for what it is. For that price, I expect amazing."}
{"text":"Burger was good I got the small and it was Huge
Fries were not great
I ordered to go took a little longer than I thought
Also for first timer disorganized. They take your order and it's priced but you go to the other end of the counter to order drinks and pay
Called my number got my burger and I had to ask for my fries.
I didn't know u could pay first than just grab your food
And go.
I'll go back and dine in and see if it's any better"}
{"text":"Never been but always passed by on my way to work.  When I first walked in to ask a question regarding my dog on the patio: one girl looked at me without saying anything and kept doing what she was doing.  I managed to get the attention of the other girl at the counter and she answered as if she could care less with an awkward facial expression.  My mom and I made our orders and when I ordered a lousy glass of water she brushed it off and said I'd get one but never did in the end.  My mom ordered a salad with her burger and I had to come back and get it where I was questioned as to where my receipt was as if they didnt believe me when I said I did order a salad.  The burgers were nothing special and could only really taste the toppings.  The salad ordered consisted of a pile of cucumbers and tomato with 3 pieces of onion, 2 pieces of pepper and a whole mountain of feta cheese. At least they were nice enough to pick up our plates in the end.  I felt as if we were intruding on their establishment and didn't even get a lousy glass of water.  I will continue to pass by and not recommend coming here to anyone."}
{"text":"Balkan food joints are hard to find in the GTA, so I appreciate that they're around to share the good food. However, this place is expensive for what it is. WIth that said, I do enjoy their food although there are better cevaps to be had at other Balkan deli's through out the GTA."}
{"text":"An old coworker took me to this place as she highly recommended it.

The concept was neat in that you choose your patty and they cook it for you.

The charbroil vs. flattop arises for me again and this place charbroils which is not my preferred method.

When I did get my burger, I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the burger very much.  It was quite flavourful and there was a good variety of condiment choices.

Unfortunately, geographically, it is far for me but if I'm ever in the area, I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"I like this spot. Delicious BBQ everything. 

Only reason it's not 5 stars.. A little on the pricey side- $18 for a half pound burger, 3 sausages + a drink."}
{"text":"It was Saturday night and boyfriend I were originally heading out to the Keg at Sherway Gardens. We got there and it was about 1-1.5hr wait for a table, I was starving. So I suggest we check out this place since we always drive by it. Our waitress was not friendly to being in with and made no suggestion even though we asked. We ended up ordering a platter and the baked cheese and a Greek salad for appetizers. Few mins later we notice there was a separate menu with specials and the platter we got we could've got a similar platter for half the price. When the platter came it was not impressive. The Greek salad was a plate of mostly tomatoes. The our waitress never checked on us once and took forever to bring the bill. Also the bathroom was disgusting. This place is not worth the price. We will not visit again."}
{"text":"My favourite burger of all time!  The veal/pork mix or whatever it is so tasty with their special sauce and this place has the best hamburger buns I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I see this place all the time and only recently visited.  The place is pretty casual - there's an area on the right of the entrance that's for take outs and to the left is a nice area for more seating.  We sat where the take-out counter was and it was busy around our table - not ideal.  (Side note: Can't wait for warmer weather to enjoy the patio)

We had the 10 oz. steak - it was alright, but I've had better - somewhat bland and tough. The service was ok...  i'd give it another chance and try something else on the menu before I rule it out."}
{"text":"Been here a few times since the renovation was completed so decide to give a review. 

We ordered striploin steak (smelled so amazing as soon as the waitress put it down), the Chevap appetizer and the calamari chopska salad. Everything were generous in size and absolutely delicious. 

The waitress is also super friendly. Great atmosphere. There's a shop on the side. I might just pick up a few burgers for home!

Good stuff!"}
{"text":"This is the best steak sandwich  I have ever had. It is more like a new york strip on a bun but is great. Great tasting steak, nice bun, and perfectly cooked.
The inside has a simple sit down area were you grab your food when it is ready and find a seat or you can sit in the area were you are served. It is great to have a choice.
The staff are nice. It was fast. A nice touch was the manager coming by to make sure we were happy."}
{"text":"Place is a rip off!!!Two royal burgers and 6 cevapi  were 45 bucks!??!No drinks or sides...pathetic really!!Overpriced minced meat is ridiculous. .there are much better options with a better quality food and more reasonable prices..never again!!"}
{"text":"popular and busy spot..
chicken sandwich very good, steak sandwich; chewy and too fatty.
$30 roughly for 2 sandwiches.. TOO MUCH, OVERPRICED."}
{"text":"Great home style food cevapi mmmmm my fave ..
They recently renovated so the prices might have jumped a bit , but it's still very decent .
Quality is great and you do get good portions ! 
The place is very nice and it is clean ! 
I do enjoy this place a lot and they do serve alcohol!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't been here before when I live so close by. Their classic burger is flavourful and the sauce they put on the bun has crunchy bits of chopped onion and feta cheese. The patty itself is flavourful and juicy. I also got some garlic fries on the side and they were awesome. 

The interior is very modern looking with a high ceiling and walls decorated with wine bottles. The patio also seemed quite nice. 

I would be happy to come back with friends and try their meat platter."}
{"text":"Royal Meats Barbecue is a place that is undergoing some pretty sick renovations. The place itself used to be pretty small, but has upgraded into this cool hip sports bar that will be opening a patio to go along with the good food that they have right now. The place specializes in meats of all kind, but seems to be centered on the steak.

I had the steak on a bun, which was a blessing and a curse. The steak meat itself was fantastic. The seasoning was well done and the meat, though cooked a bit more than I liked, still had a great taste. The bad part is that it's served on a hoagie roll that doesn't do it justice. Impossible to eat a good steak between bread. I ended up just knife and forking it like an OG.

The place is pretty sweet and they got lookers for servers to boot. The menu is rather large, and though prices are a tad high for lunch, it's probably a pretty kickass place to go for dinner and to watch the game."}
{"text":"Here is probably the best way to describe Royal Meats

Service: 5/5 - The staff here are super friendly and the service is commended. Once your food is ready a very pleasant staff will dress your meal the way you like it. 

Quality of Food: 5/5 - I have to honestly admit, I'm really addicted to their menu. I love the fact that it's fresh and cooked to order. So nothing is reheated or cooked earlier. That makes a huge difference. You must try their Chevapas, none of that fake sausage taste! Great Job! 

Temperature of Food: 5/5 -  When served right to order your food is always hot and fresh. That makes a huge impression. 

Value of Meals: 4/5 - Unfortunately, I did not try everything on their menu yet. But I'm addicted to their Chevapas. Amazing!! A must try. 

Atmosphere: Casual and a nice patio. This place is very relaxing and simple. 

Would I Return: Yes

Time of Meal: Dinner"}
{"text":"I went here recently with a group of co-workers for lunch, as it is a favourite spot for them. It was my first time going, but certainly won't be my last. I had the beef & lamb Chevaps, as this was highly recommended by the group. The appetizer portion was on special the day I went, so two of us shared that, along with some grilled calamari, and shopska salad - which is very similar to Greek Salad. I also had a side of lepinya bread, which is served warm, as they bake it fresh in-house. 

Portions and price are both excellent, but service was a bit spotty - I couldn't tell if our server was completely spaced out or if she just couldn't hear me, because when I asked her about the menu, she kind of stared at me like I was speaking another language. I had to ask the other people at my table because I couldn't get a straight answer from her - she kept looking around the restaurant, instead of at me, while I was speaking. Very odd experience. Still, the food was exceptional and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The place is nice with modern touches and atmosphere - good daily specials like today Sunday was 4$ ceaser and it was good! Had the deluxe burger which was stuffed with great fixing hang and cheese. I thought it was a little on the pricey side for a burger at 14$ with no side, but the burger was good! The coconut shrimp was quite good. I may return for drink specials"}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss..  I sometimes go and have a really good sandwich, which leaves me eager to return.  Then when I go back, the meal will be completely lackluster, like the one I got last night

First let's address the prices, which are pretty absurd.  $10+tax for a chicken sandwich, $11+tax for an order of calamari, $15+tax for a steak sandwich..  We can all agree the value is definitely not here.  In no way shape or form do any of these sandwiches cost anything near these prices to assemble, which you will notice right away

The fries come from a clear plastic bag, frozen and bland, and the portion is on the small side.  I tend to think almost all of their items besides the meat are provided by Sysco as even their grill spray comes in a gigantic can marked SYSCO that they leave on display for everyone to see.

Sysco and quality are not synonymous so that's bad news right there.

Combine the fact that they're serving mostly frozen accompaniments and none of their desserts are made in house, you're pretty much just paying for an unmarinated piece of meat to be plopped on the grill

For this reason I have a hard time recommending it, sorry.  Items should cost several dollars less and they should stop using crap side dishes, is my final thoughts

PS: I hate their red sauce.  Way too much onion"}
{"text":"The ground pork Royal Burger was pretty tasty, and the small 6oz size was very generous!"}
{"text":"This place stands out if you're driving by because it looks out of place in the middle of an industrial area. Driving by, that's how I found it, purely by chance. Of course, I had to investigate.

As their name suggests, there are lots of choices for meat lovers, along with a selection of salads. One item caught my attention because I've never heard of it before. Chevaps. My server explained that it's a Yugoslavian dish and described it as a skinless sausage. It's available in two varieties - pork and veal or beef and lamb. Cool, I'm in. I ordered five of each and a side of garlic fries.

It looked exactly as described, a grilled skinless sausage. It also reminded me of a mini kebab or kofta. It looked good, smelled good, and tasted really good! It had a nice blend of spices that I couldn't really pinpoint. It was on the verge of being a little too salty but very tasty. The fries were crispy and had just the right amount of garlic. A little pricey but very good meal.

I don't know if or when I'll be in this neighbourhood again but I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Waited for close to 45 minutes to get a burger!  Totally got back to work late. Expensive but good. Not the best. But not the worst. Would never repeat."}
{"text":"This place has amazing burgers. As far as awesome burgers in Etobicoke, this is my go-to place, so far. They're the only place I know of that serves a proper, 1 pound burger. For those of you counting that's around 1000 calories of awesomeness. The meat, I found, was skillfully cooked (given our silly laws here that won't let you grind meat on the spot and have a medium rare burger). The seasoning in the actual burger was mild, but it makes up for it in one of their own condiments. I don't know what it's called, but you must get this mustardy/ketchupy/oniony/peppery yellow goopy spread they have. It is wonderful and pairs well with other toppings you put on it. It also brings out the flavour of the meat more. The 1 pound of meat. The bun is also quite tasty, and make sure they toast it for you. It's great quality bread.

If you want a tasty/greasy burger, this place is not for you, go to Apache Burger nearby. If you want a small, delicious gourmet burger with fancy toppings this place is not for you. If you want a *good*, large burger, this place is perfect.

I also had a pound of chicken burger the other day, it was less special than the beef burger but still good.

All in all, good quality, great quantity. 10 bucks for a pound burger isn't bad at all. I don't see why you would pay 7.5 for the 1/2 pound though. (Prices are rough estimates)."}
{"text":"Don't plan a party here. The service is terrible. 

There were warning signs from the very beginning. We got there and had reservations for a party of 10. They lost our reservation, so we couldn't sit in the dining room and were relegated to self-service.

When I went to the cash register to order my food, they messed up my order by adding something I didn't want. I went back to ask for my money back and she gave me back what the price was. I ask for the tax back as well - it was a small amount, but it doesn't hurt to ask. She gave me so much attitude for just asking and in the end refused to give it. 

Then... they forgot to give me my gravy. \"Gravy? You're complaining about gravy?\" Yes. I'm complaining about it because when I went to ask for it, the same girl gave me attitude. Then it took what felt like 10 minutes just to get me that gravy. I was standing there, waiting, for 10 minutes, for gravy! Unheard of.

The food was good, but my experience there was so horrible, I can't recommend it to anyone. So much for my celebration..."}
{"text":"My family and I just keep continuing to go here because of how awesome it is. They accommodated us on Mother's Day even though we didn't have a reservation and the restaurant was packed. (I still recommend having a reservation, though!). Also, I forgot to mention earlier that we had ordered catering for my dads 50th and they were just awesome. Food was delivered on time, hot, and our guests were lining up for more. It was very reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Pick what you want grilled, 
eat the food they grilled. 

Have nothing else to compare to, so gotta say... 
Some pretty good Serb/East Euro influenced food.
Chevaps and beer - thats what's up."}
{"text":"I will admit it was a little while ago that I personally ate at this place but my mind was refreshed by an experience a friend of mine had there recently so I am compelled to share my story.

First of all I wasn't impressed by the menu style and service... it seemed a little confusing at times which made it harder for me to decide on my order. They may or may not have corrected this since I have been but I just wanted to mention that because it was something that affected my experience. The staff seemed to know nothing about anything and were incredibly miserable to me and the guest I was with. This was something that even my friend emphasized recently so I know this has not changed.  I believe they still have you choose your own piece of raw meat and then cook it to order and season/dress it how you like.... very Harvey's with less enthusiasm I would say. I got a reg chicken on a bun style deal and although the portion was large a found the meat to be bland and underseasoned. Overall I wasn't too impressed with the meal I had and nor was the person I was with either.

The ambience is really hard to describe, half road side diner and half wendy's (new decor) and the seating was kind of awkward. The patio seems to be busy often but the lot iteself is located right on a corner and that particular corner is right in an industrial area so there are a lot of trucks and traffic. Not exactly the best view from the patio in my opinion but it still seems to be the busiest part of the place anyways.

Other then that there really isn't much else that can be siad for this place, I think there are way better establishments out there offering better quality food & service at a better price as well...."}
{"text":"Ok...so this is a cool restaurant. 1/2 butcher shop, 1/2 sit down restaurant 1/2 take out! The place was quiet...it was a Tuesday nite & the weather was crappy which explains it. 

I had the Royal Burger Deluxe! It was most certainly my \"top 10-lifetime\" for burgers! It was delicious! It was soft, tasty & filled with goat cheese! The bun was oversized (as you'll see by the pic) & called a Lepinya Bun. Ot came with the standard toppings as well. Our server \"Katarina\" recommended the garlic fries which were outrageously good. Very buttery/garlicky. It was a small order but worth it taste wise! My wife ordered the \"Chevaps Burger\" but it was a little over-cooked & I agreed with her assessment. 

All things considered...a solid meal. It's a do-over!"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday for the first time.  Super friendly staff.  Beautiful streamlined interior.  And best of all delicious food.  Ordered the meat platter #1 which came with an assortment of meats including lamb, chicken, pork and beef as well as potatoes and bread...all delicious.  Also ordered a side of broccoli salad....best I have had anywhere!  Cannot wait to go back and try an assortment of their fish mains."}
{"text":"Waste of money. Over priced for what you get. The meats are very salty, you will need a gallon of water to help you digest after a meal here. Stay away."}
{"text":"The food is tasty and unique and the service slick. The Chevaps sandwich always satisfies me. Last year I had them cater a work lunch and the food was a big hit with my team."}
{"text":"Okay, price may seem high, but you surely get what you pay for. Okay, my wife's steak came a little overcooked, but seasoning was perfect. My aunt's lamp chop was perfect. What we're surprised, first, was how good the  garlic fries were. You can taste the garlic but it's not overpowering.
What I did not expect from a MEAT restaurant is  how well they cook their fish. My mom and my sister went for  the basse and it came grilled perfectly. I had the Talipia Sandwich and it was AMAZING. I've been to many restaurants, even ones that are \"seafood restaurants\" will overcook Talipia, let alone trying to make a sandwich out of it. It was cooked just right, so it's still moist with perfect seasoning.
The down side? We were so full we didn't have any room left for  dessert."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. I must give credit to this fine looking establishment. I find it overpriced for fast food and the variety of topics could be slightly better but otherwise I will return again."}
{"text":"Excellent meat, never frozen and always fresh. Their cevaps are some of the best in the GTA, and it's impossible to leave this place hungry. Fresh cuts are beautifully displayed in the butcher shop refrigerator for your selection.Great lunch stop in you're in the area."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have ever had. Expensive!"}
{"text":"CHEVAPS! I love the chevaps here, as well as the wings which are prepared in a much healthier way than most-- perfectly grilled with a touch of smoky flavor and none of that awful grease and fat. They could improve on their sauces though, which lack flavor and seem to be a bit watered down. Their onion rings are also good as well as sweet potato fries. I have not tried their other meats although I would like to, but I would never leave out chevaps which is the main reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars. It may be pricier than most, but worth your money in my opinion. Service may be a bit curt but efficient and attentive. Just last week, we ordered a big tray of chevaps to take to our family lunch, and everyone loved it!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go to this place for awhile. I mistakenly thought it was going to be a BBQ place as in pulled pork, brisket or deli with smoked meats etc. They did grill everything which gave a nice taste to the food.

Overall, here's what I thought 

Atmosphere/Cleanliness - very clean in the restaurant and patio area. There were flat screen TVs on the patio which was different. They are currently expanding for more seating. I liked that you could see the entire kitchen and grill area where the food is prepared- nice to see how it's being handled and cooked. The washroom wasn't very clean which was disappointing.

Service- as some have already mentioned, the service is curt, not overly friendly but not rude either. I had ordered their hamburger as it's supposed to be one of their best items and I forgot to ask if their were onions in the burger. When she said there were onions in them and I said I couldn't have them due to an allergy she was extremely understanding and polite about it. She made sure she told me about any toppings or sauces that I couldn't have including my husbands dish which I appreciated. 

Menu Variety- not a huge amount to choose from. The meat is displayed at the front so you can see how fresh it is. The burgers are enormous- wish I could have tried one :( 

Quality of Food- I had the grilled chicken sandwich on a bun. The chicken tasted great and was a huge portion. I felt it could have used seasoning/sauce or something to make it stand out and be unique because it had nothing on it- not even salt/pepper. The bun was very good and toppings were fresh. I liked that you didn't have to pay extra for bacon or feta (although the pricing is pretty high to start). The fries were not great- seemed like they had been sitting out for awhile. My husband had some type of sausage sandwich which he thoroughly enjoyed. The grilled pepper sauce/spread was his favourite topping. 

Value- it was around $30 for 2 sandwiches, one fry and 2 cans of pop. The portions and quality of the food were very good, but more variety would be welcome. When you think of a meat shop, you think of more than just grilled chicken, pork sausage and burgers- maybe some smoked deli meats, greater variety in the options for the meats they do serve. 

Would I Return- yes, but not a place I'd go to all the time for a $15 chicken sandwich. My husband says the sausage is excellent and worth trying."}
{"text":"Wayyyyyyyyyyy overpriced.... Food is good, just not worth the price. I've eaten there only twice... First time I had witnessed someone picking their nose while cooking food (this was a couple years back)... But hindered my decision for a long time... Second time was alright, but I had ordered the food, so hopefully they kept their fingers on the spatulas instead of up their noses."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying this review doesn't even take service into account. I am from Serbia, so I know how terrible my people are at customer service; so let's leave the terrible service aside. Just this visit alone the server screwed up 3 things with our order. 

The food: 
I've been coming here for years, my family has been going to the original Royal Meats butcher for over 5 years at this point. Recently (last year or 2) this location has undergone ridiculously large renovations to try and make it something that authentic Serbian food does not need to be, at all; pretentious and fancy. 

These people are bastardizing authentic Serbian food and killing it. No pride

\"House sauce\" - I don't understand why you would have to change the traditional name of Ajvar, and add feta cheese (wtf) just to help Canadians and others feel more comfortable. 

\"Royal Burger\" - its called a pljeskavitca. And it shouldn't be given a stupid American version name just to satisfy the status quo. 

\"Royal cannon\" - really?! Have some pride in the country and the food where you come from and try to make money on. Call the dishes by their REAL name, Kara?or?eva schnitzel.  

Also, the pricing; absolutely LUDACRIS! 6 cevapi for $15? What kind of drugs are you on?!?! 

The owners of Royal Meats need to take a deep hard look at themselves and go back to what they were; a favorite place for Serbs and other Eastern Europeans where they brought friends to show them a piece of our culture and heritage. NOT a homogenized, bastardized version of Serbian food meant to cater to North Americans. 

GET BACK TO YOURS ROOTS!"}
{"text":"Just okay. I think I went in an off day because I've heard nothing but great reviews about this place. The service was slow, while it wasn't busy, and the food was fresh but was just okay. I'll give this place another shot but won't order the same thing again- chicken dinner."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Royal Meats, but definitely not my last! The restaurant looks like a gourmet sandwich shop from the outside which really stands out since the area is drab and industrial. Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by the waitress who was friendly throughout the whole time we were there.  We ordered the large burger which was a finely ground patty mixed with veal and pork served between a traditional pita-like toasted bun. The burger was very tender and tasty and was served with garnishes of your choice.  
We also ordered the Cevaps sandwich. The meat rolls were very tasty; another veal and pork mix served on the same toasted bun. 
As for garnishes, we asked for the spicy sauce and cheese based cream. We were expecting a more traditional soft & creamy spread, but the one served was more of a cream cheese texture - still very yummy!
Both the burger & chevaps sandwich  were satisfying & really hit the spot. The staff was quite friendly making it a place worth visiting if you're in the area.  Another downtown location should be opening soon."}
{"text":"This place looks like a giant chain, and it's suburban location might lead you to think it is a soulless money making burger machine, but it's postal code is fooling you. This place is mom and pop through and through. 

Royal BBQ offers a wide array of burgers, chicken and fish sandwiches all made fresh to order. Their buns seem too big and bread-y, but they're soft and tasty and absorb the medium burger juices perfectly. Their onion rings are bready and boss, and I recommend ordering these rather than their fries. 

If you're looking to grill at home, they sell their house-made products frozen at the cash register.
