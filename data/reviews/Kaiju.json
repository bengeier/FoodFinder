{"text":"Tried just cause of the hype on yelp. Curry was good with the chicken and rice. What I didn't like which is just my own taste is when the salad mixed with the curry. Overall food was very good, service was very friendly and the location isn't that hard to find with all the signs in the plaza."}
{"text":"Surreptitiously located in a lonely food court within the nascent shopping center below yonge and college, this place offers a type of dish that you probably won't find many other places -- Japanese curry.

I ordered the katsu curry from a sweet elderly woman who had the awkwardness and anxiety of a newcomer to the food industry. The price wasn't too bad, came out to 9 dollars, but I believe I may have gotten a better deal from the Korean place next door.

The food itself was awesome. The katsu was generously proportioned and satisfying. The curry itself was sweet and brown, and although it was missing the turmeric that my brain loves so much, it was very tasty. Mopping up the remains of the curry with rice was the best part.

Give it a try, its a bit different. But also take a look around because the other places in the food court look good as well."}
{"text":"Tried twice, very generous staff and service, but food did not impress me too much. Went to another place in North York near the ZenQ, amazing taste and big contrast. Overall, good but definitely not 4 star IMHO but it is probably the best choice of the food court."}
{"text":"The owner is super nice, their curry is very flavourful and well priced. Best of all they stay open late when everything else is closed :D 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for some home style Japanese food. The chicken is always piping hot and fresh, the curry sauce delicious, and the portions generous. The service is also quite friendly with the owner usually coming over to ask how things are. 

I usually swap between the chicken katsu and karage but friends have commented that they quite like the fish. Probably my favourite lunch spot near work. Only complaint is seeing the other two places in the desolate food court considerably less busy."}
{"text":"The Aura underground mall/food court basically feels like an apocalyptic wasteland. I half expect zombies a la Walking Dead to appear the moment I let my guard down. 

That said, it should not dissuade you to visit Kaiju. Just remember zombies don't truly die until you hit them in the head. I read the many positive reviews about Kaiju by evidently real humans and decided it was worth the try given its convenient location to my residential abode. 

I feel a bit silly commenting about the service of a food court restaurant, but the lady manning the shop was definitely friendly, efficient, and quick. She offered me a free sample but I told her I was going to order a meal. 

Food wise: I'm not a curry expert, but damn was the curry and chicken cutlet delicious. It was a rainy day when I had my meal so I guess Japanese comfort food pairs well with crappy Toronto rainy fall weather. 

Pro-tip: get your meal to go. The Aura food court is depressing and there might be zombies. I hope Kaiju keeps up the quality and service. They would do even better in a stand alone shop with better decor but until then, I'll be coming back for the food."}
{"text":"I never had Katsu curry before, and this place was the perfect introduction to it. Highly personable staff who can help explain the menu to you. The chicken katsu is a great start to Kaiju's offerings. It's in the basement food court of a shopping mall.  Look for it -- definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"If you can find Kaiju, you're in for one of the best value for your money in the downtown area. For less than 10 dollars, you can get one of the best curry and katsu (Japanese cutlet) experiences in the city!"}
{"text":"Delicious! My first time here and I will be back! Best Katsu curry I've ever tasted and very friendly service. Prices are reasonable too! A good selection of veggie options as well. I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Absolutely THE BEST!!! Loved their curry! Price is fair too. You have an option go request for extra curry for the price $2. Their staff are super friendly. Also nice quiet food court even during busy lunch times and dinner times which is good cause you can sit and enjoy your meal with your friends and  be able to chat. 

They are selling kaya in small container for $5 each. I absolutely love it!!! I put it on my toast every morning for breakfast! 

Probably the best Japanese curry place you can find in Toronto! Way better than Gyugyuya on Dundas! If you are a curry can make sure to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great Japanese curry! The Chicken Katsu came out hot and crispy.

Good food comes in a cheap price - for $8 you can get curry with a choice of chicken/pork/fish/shrimp."}
{"text":"Taste 5/5
Portion 2/5

Total: 3.5/5

For $9, the portion is ridiculously small. Literally 2/3 is rice, topped with 4 thin slices of pork/chicken, AND they're skimpy with the curry as well. However, the curry is absolutely DELICIOUS. I literally lick the container clean. The katsu is freshly deep fried and super crispy. Their food is good enough to make me round the half star up instead of down.

On another note, this is NOT authentic japanese curry. Nothing close. It's a fusion of several blends, it reminds me of the curry my mom makes sometimes (she tends to experiment and mix japanese and Malay curry). Nonetheless, as other reviewers have mentioned, it is liquid gold. So yum.

I'd definitely recommend this place for small eaters. Otherwise, you'd probably need to order 2."}
{"text":"Being of Japanese descent and growing up around Japanese dishes and curry, it was comforting having the ability to be treated to an amazing, authentic dish. This place is one of the best hidden gems in Toronto. Located inside the Aura building's eerie food court, it truly is tucked away. However, it is well worth the search as Brian, the owner, really knows what he's doing. He makes an exceptional tonkatsu. As well, he has a friendly and well-trained staff. The curry tastes just like the ones I've had in Japan. Very great service, delicious food."}
{"text":"Chicken Katsu is perfectly crispy without being oily and the curry has a great sweet, yet salty, taste to it.

Great place when you are craving a Japanese curry fix!

The service is great as the woman is so friendly."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is such a hidden gem. The black pepper chicken is so light and perfectly battered. The Japanese poutine is so tasty. The price for this quality of food is unbeatable."}
{"text":"It's really sad to see a good store rot away in such a horrid location. This place is literally empty and many units in this building have broken their leases, making the reasons to even walk in this location negligible. 

Aside from the location they are trapped in, the food steals the spotlight. I was brought here through the amazing Yelp reviews by filtering $ only. It is very unusual to see a food court restaurant receive such consistent, high reviews. Out of curiousity, I decided to check it out myself. 

I was initially disappointed by the photos and the presentation of the food. I ordered the pork curry while my girlfriend got the fish fillet. I started with the cabbage coleslaw, which tasted like anything you would expect. However, when the coleslaw sneaked into the curry,instead of grief, I was very surprised by the taste. The curry really is something special for the price you pay for. 

The owners were extremely welcoming, and I would come here more often if I studied at UofT. 

Curry & Pork: 4.5/5

Curry & Fish Filet: 5/5

I hope that when their lease terminates (1 year left,) they achieve the success they deserve."}
{"text":"The passion the chef's have toward the items they serve is reflected in the delicious food available here. The vegetable and fruit based curry is undoubtedly some of the best out there, especially alongside their steamed rice. The tofu cheesecake is also light, unique in taste, and is perfect dessert to cap off a hearty meal."}
{"text":"Located in the sadly neglected hidden labyrinth in the basement of the Aura building, this little food court location offers some tasty Japanese curry.  They somehow manage to not dry out the meat when deep-frying it.  I particularly like the fried fish curry.  Portions are quite generous.  Stick with the curries, it's their best feature; we tried one of their Chinese dishes once and while it was okay, it definitely isn't their strength.  The staff will happily bring the tray with your meal to your seat if you decide to not stand and wait for your tray.  Lots of spaces in the food court to sit comfortably and quietly; this place is not a thoroughfare, the only people who walk through are usually the ones who intend to eat at this food court or live at the Aura building.  

My only complaint about this place is the way they pack their take-out.  They place the rice, meat and salad inside a square take-out Styrofoam box and then ladle the curry on top.  If the box jostles around as you carry it home in the plastic bag, the curry will leak out from the corners of the box resulting in lost deliciousness.  I hope they decide to pack the curry separately into a Styrofoam bowl to reduce spillage and thus also avoid making the katsu soggy if you don't eat the food immediately."}
{"text":"Had to wait 10 minutes for fast food. Just an annoyance on top of the bad food. Ordered the Tori Karaage and the chicken tasted off. Chicken was not fresh! Fearing possible food poisoning I got out of there fast."}
{"text":"Well done! Love the food, great prices, plus the Malaysian couple are super sweet. Well worth the adventure to find this hidden food court place. Also if you know what is up, try their Malaysian dishes! Curry is great, but their southeast asian dishes are whats up!!! Plus they have home made kaya! Over-all a great fix for anyone who misses that glorious SE Asian flavor!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with japanese curry although it was very tasty and a good-sized portion."}
{"text":"Ordered the fried fish fillet as some have recommended.  The fish was crispy, but it was their curry that tasted really good.  Good quick lunch spot for its price."}
{"text":"Order the grilled chicken curry every time and never let me down! Gotta try other items next time."}
{"text":"10$ tax incl for the Japanese curry chicken   
Great taste. Quick service. The owners are a little extra friendly. Was Perfect that they brought my food to me, but a little overboard when I was approached while eating lol but it was cute... The curry speaks for itself. A must try if you like fried chicken"}
{"text":"This place was even easier to find when a fellow Yelper mentioned how to get there. Otherwise, its a bit harder to find. I got to know the owner 'Bryan' who is from Ipoh, Malaysia. He has an intriguing story of how he started this place, and why the city would screw someone of 140+ stores, but only 20+ stores operating??? And get someone to rent the space for 5 yrs... Enough for the rant.

I had only tried Japanese curry once at Cafe Michi, which I wasn't too crazy about at the time, so when I heard this is one of their signatures, I had to give it a try. I tried their crispy fish fillet with coleslaw, rice, and their famous curry (brown colour gravy). The taste is sweet with hidden soft spice and creamy gravy like. The fish fillet was very nicely battered and taste nice. The rice is rice. The coleslaw tasted nice and light as well. 

Besides the curry, Bryan also has some Malay dishes I have yet to try, and he makes fresh 'Kaya' spread which is sweet coconut creamy paste. The prices are definitely worth it, and if every fellow Yelper can come down here more often to enjoy his food, you will know its a solid gem in downtown. IF you are considering a massive group gathering meal, this place is great, b/c the food court is almost always empty and has a seating capacity of 100+..."}
{"text":"Solid tasting chicken and other menu items. First time that I had visited service was superb. However this most recent visit will keep me away. Very long wait time with other clients orders being put ahead of mine with no noticeable reason. 20 minute wait time had me scratching my head. 

Good if you have lots of time."}
{"text":"After discovering this place through some foodies, I decided to give it a try...I'm disappointed in myself that I haven't found this place sooner

Within a two week span I believe I have ate there seven times with my girlfriend

Although I want to try other items on the menu, I can't steer away from the chicken cutlet curry

For such an obscure location, it sure has some amazing food!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place!

 I have never tried REAL Japanese curry like this. Everything is just perfect. The salads are fresh and light, the deep fried food is perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and what tops it is their hot sauce which is crazy hot and so tasty! The prices are right! Expect me here all the time!"}
{"text":"I am a Japanese myself and I am not going to lie, the curry here is very delicious. You can taste the flavors and spices that have slowly blended in to the curry to execute an exquisite flavor. This curry to me is more of a fusion of both Japanese and South Eastern flavor, which makes it uniquely good and one of a kind.

On top of this, the price here is relatively low in comparison to other Japanese restaurants, moreover the workers there are very friendly! 

If you are craving for some cheap Japanese food, Kaiju will not let you down. I have yet to try out the other menus, but the amazing curry keeps me from doing so! Thank you for reading :)"}
{"text":"Delicious curry for a small food court restaurant, and cripsy katsu to boot! The breaded meat is on the drier side, but I suppose that's where extra curry sauce helps. A hidden gem if you're looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I fell in love with Japanese curry while I was in Japan and I've been craving it ever since.  The katsu curry here is totally on point - crispy, delicious. The serving size is generous, the curry itself is sweet and flavourful. It comes with rice and a little cole-slaw.  The owners are super friendly and really want to succeed. I am definitely getting food here a lot in the future."}
{"text":"When my friend and I decided to try a new place for lunch, we didn't realize Kaiju was in a food court. Neither of us had been to this building before (same building as Marshalls, Bed Bath and Beyond, Reds is). It seems relatively new and clean. If you're looking for food court food, Kaiju is probably one of your better options. They're also right across Ryerson, so I assume they get a lot of student traffic. I haven't tried the others, but it seemed like most people headed straight to Kaiju when they got into the food court. 

The couple that run the place are very polite. I ordered a Cheese Omelette, which is probably as good as it gets in a food court, but didn't really satisfy my omurice craving. My friend ordered Chicken Katsu, which took a while. There was some problem with it. The couple gave my friend a free pop because of the long wait and they even came out to the table to check on us. You don't usually get that kind of service in a food court.

For the price I paid, it's definitely better value than the food courts that are in the financial district. This also isn't something I would be able to get in the financial district."}
{"text":"Kaiju is a food court masterpiece. I went just before closing on a week night and they treated the empty food court as my personal dining room, complete with waiter service. Although it's tempting to take-out, I was suggested to sit down to maximize the experience. Yes, it doesn't look the best (a sea of brown sauce), but the taste game is on point. It's a bit less of an experience than Mr. Tonkatsu on Bloor, though it's similar, but I think the sauce is better here. If you're into spicy, be sure to ask for a container of hot sauce and it's also made in-store with a secret recipe. I came back again for Mama's Vegetables, which is solid, but I'd opt for the cutlet next time."}
{"text":"Located in approximately the sketchiest ghosttown of a food court on earth, this place is, oddly, highly regarded as more or less the best restaurant in the neighbourhood.

I think there is a bit of hype there, but the place is definitely very good.

The specialty is definitely the Chicken Katsu.  Their take on it is a bit different than you may have had at some places that serve this dish with a sticky/sweet/tangy sauce.  The sauce here is more like a mix between gravy and curry and more on the savory side.

The only complaint is that they serve you in a styrofoam container with disposable utensils, even if you eat in."}
{"text":"I had the fried shrimp curry and tofu cheesecake. The curry comes with rice and a coleslaw salad (I think). There were 4 pieces of shrimp. It was filling, hot and good. It had a slight spice kick, but wasn't too spicy. The tofu cheesecake was nice, simple, light. I didn't really taste tofu which is great! Eat the food hot in the food court. The people who work there are really nice and want you to enjoy their food!"}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem located in the Aura food court. One of the best Japanese curries I've had, consistent and reliable every order. A good meal for under $10 and it's the ONLY food court joint where they come out to check up on you to ensure your meal is flawless."}
{"text":"Great owner and even better curry!

I saw the great reviews on yelp and decided to check the place out while in Toronto. They're located in a pretty dead mall in the basement food court. Most of the other stalls are for rent or were closed. But this place was definitely a bright spot. 

When we got there, the owner was talking to a couple eating, and as soon as we walked up to the counter she was right behind us and greeted us. She gave in depth descriptions about the food on the menu which we welcomed because we had no idea! We settled for the chicken karage with their curry. While we waited for the food, she asked us where we were from and told us about her children and she was just so friendly!! And when we got the food, it was so good! Crispy chicken and very flavourful curry. 

This place was really a hidden gem, but I wish it wasnt! I think if they were in a better location, there would be a long lineup all day. GO TO KAIJU you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I've gotten their Kaiju monster combo to share with a friend. Curry was delicious. I enjoy it a lot. location is hidden under the Aura food court. It doesn't get much traffic there but most people eating in the food court are getting food from this place. Another thing to note is that we went with a group of about 15 people and fit all of us since the food court is so empty."}
{"text":"As a dessert lover, I tried to visit Kaiju to try the Tofu Cheesecake, however found out that they only have it available on SATURDAYS, so had to revisit next time in the downtown area. 

I was finally able to go back and visit them on a Saturday evening, luckily they still had some slices of the Tofu cheesecake left! only ordered one slice ($4 per slice) but I should have ordered another slice to bring home! The Tofu Cheesecake exceeded my expectations, it was very silky and smooth, you cant even tell its tofu or cheesecake, and it wasnt overly sweet, the graham crumb crust was really delicious too. Definitely agree with the other review posted, that if a panacotta and cheesecake had a baby it'd be the tofu cheesecake!

We were too full from eating at the CNE, so only had room to eat dessert, but next time will have to go back and try the other items on their menu.

The service was AWESOME!! The owners had come out and chatted with us, asking what we thought of the tofu cheesecake, they even gave us free samples of the Japanese curry, Kaya and tofu pudding to try! Will definitely go back to visit them for a meal next time!

We also followed the other reviews to find the location, as its a bit difficult to find. But we found the Shops of Aura plaza near Yonge & College, went down the escalators and followed the signs to the food court until we found Kaiju!"}
{"text":"Owner is super friendly and the food is good!! Came here on Monday night before they closed, they offered us to try different pastry made by themselves. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"The food is so good, I like the pork katsu especially the curry sauce!!! I highly recommended people to try their other food, like tofu cheesecakes, fish katsu (the fish tastes really delicious)"}
{"text":"Great food. I've had the poutine, chicken and fish katsu on different visits and all three were amazing. Although it's true that the underground mall location is an unfortunate choice, I came here for the food and not the ambiance."}
{"text":"First experience here is sadly very ho-hum. The chicken Katsu I ordered tastes pretty good but wasn't very hot at all. The gravy has a taste that makes me think of powder packet gravy. And worst of all - the rice is pretty horrible. Mushy and heavily clumped together. Does not feel like a fresh meal at all. I'll come back once more to hopefully find something fresher but I am not impressed."}
{"text":"Found it from the comments. It is downstairs of bed bath and beyond. Came around closing time, boss was nice enough to make the food for us, and offered curry and kaya while we waited. We ordered grill fish curry, and eggplant with minced pork. Portion is great, taste amazing. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Staying at the Eaton Chelsea in Toronto my wife and I were looking for a cheap dinner close by. We found Kaiju on Yelp, and decided to give it a try. We got there right at 8:00, which we later realized was closing time. The man working there, whom I can only assume is the owner, was very friendly, and offered us a sample of the curry when he found out it was our first time there. We were sold. My wife, who does not normally like curry loved it.

I had the pork katsu, which came with rice, curry and coleslaw. My wife had the spicy thai chicken, which came with rice. Both were fantastic, and fresh. We watched as he made the batter on the spot. 

My only regret is that since we are staying a short time, we won't be able to use the buy 10 get 1 free card.

If you have trouble finding it, it is in the food court of the Aura shopping center at Yonge and Gerrard."}
{"text":"I needed to emerge from my unintentional Yelp reviewing hiatus to review this gem of a poorly-located yet wonderfully executed food stand! 

First: lovely service. The folks who run Kaiju are The Nicest People you'll meet. As I walked up I was intercepted by a friendly woman who asked if I'd heard of them and offered me a sample of their curry sauce on rice - if I wasn't already going to order, the curry would have convinced me. It's delicious and rich and sweet and thick and savory and so comforting. If you've never tried Japanese curry, I very much recommend going just to try it (and yes--you'll love it). 

I ordered the fried fish curry on her recommendation (I don't eat chicken, but they have lots of it). While I was waiting I was shown pictures of their other dishes, copies of all the good reviews they've already had (I told them I'd found out about them through the good reviews on yelp, and they were delighted), and was repeatedly thanked for visiting them. 

All of the curry dishes are $8 or less: a really good deal especially for the amount of food you get. Mine was a huge perfectly crispy panko-fried, flaky filet, a generous portion of rice, yummy slaw salad, and of course, a big ol' pool of curry gravy (on the bottom, not poured on top, so as to not soggify the fish before I got back to work. Yes, I made up the word soggify). 

They have an even better deal on offer if you're ordering for two: chicken or pork katsu, fried fish, and shrimp curry plus sides for $18. 

It took all my willpower not to order the curry poutine, but I'm glad I didn't because I could barely finish my lunch already. Next time for sure!

P.S. You'll find them by entering on Yonge St. as if to visit the Marshalls/Bed Bath & Beyond, going downstairs and following signs to Food Court."}
{"text":"Very good curry. This place is single handedly floating the ghost town that is the Aura Condo basement. 

All Katsu's are all perfectly breaded and fried to crispyness. Only downside is the price, chicken katsu is almost $10 after taxes which to me is a tad pricey for a food court take out. It is downtown though and portion sizes are decent.

One tip i'd give is if you're not immediately eating the curry, ask for it on the side so you can slather it over the crispy meat and rice when you're ready to eat it to prevent it from getting soggy.

Service is excellent you'll feel like a friendly auntie or uncle serves you every time. Give it a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Had the Pork katsu, it's crisp, tender and not oily at all.  The portion is good, about the size of my palm. Even I picked the mild curry sauce, it's still quite spicy.  I wish it could come with a bit more rice.  But for $8.75 + tax in downtown, the price is alright.  

Another plus is location, that food court doesn't have much traffic even at lunch hour, it's so easy to find an empty table."}
{"text":"The owner was super friendly but most importantly the food was amazing!  I ordered the jumbo combo (mix of pork, fish, and shrimp katsu) and the samba udon.  The owner insisted that one order was enough but I couldn't resist given the wonderful reviews I had read.  Even in a take out order, everything remained crisp.  The meat and seafood didn't feel oily and were seasoned well.  The fish was especially moist...a must try!  The curry sauce is unique and consistency was thick, more for dipping.  I would definitely go back and try other dishes especially their house made poutine.  Place would have much better business with a less obscure location."}
{"text":"Loved it.

My wife and I shared the chicken katsu as a snack - simple breaded chicken and coleslaw-like salad with the star of the show -- Japanese curry. I heard the typical version isn't spicy, but they have 4 spice levels (mild, med, hot, and Kaiju). We chose hot and would do so again, but beware if you're not used to real spice. The chef gave us a taste of the spicy sauce before making the dish just to make sure!

A few notes that I can't fit into sentences
- The owner is from Singapore and this is their first foray into Toronto
- The staff are extremely friendly and helpful
- The foodcourt is still mostly empty, hopefully the area will get busier as more places open in this underground mini-mall
- Can't wait to go back to try the Malaysian dishes"}
{"text":"Came here to try the Malaysian sambal fried udon. Absolutely loved it. Could have been more spicy though, but I was told by the auntie that next time I should ask for more spicy because not everyone can handle the spice. Apparently, what I got was \"mild spice\" lol. Lesson learnt. I will definitely be back again! 

Price-wise, it was around $10 which is pretty reasonable for Yonge-Dundas area."}
{"text":"For what it is- a food court food stall, the food is delicious and service good. Had the chicken katsu based on existing reviews and the food was cooked fresh and served within 6 minutes (longer than the avg food court options) but the flavors and quality are worth it. 
The rice was cooked well, the Cole slaw fresh and lightly dressed, the chicken crisp, seasoned, good portion and delicious and the curry, yum, seasoned, hot, spiced and flavorful. 

Overall a really good stop."}
{"text":"Great prices and really good food, it's in the basement under Marshalls. Love the Malaysian couple who owns this place, so nice and friendly!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and lovely staff. 

I wandered here on a late Saturday afternoon. It wasn't very busy and the lady at the counter was super friendly. I ordered the chicken katsu curry and the tofu cheesecake. She made sure that they had  cheesecakes in a to go container so it wouldn't fall apart on my walk home. I hardly waited 5 minutes for my meal to be cooked and packed up. 

I underestimated my walk home and it was probably a half hour later before I could dive into my meal. By that time, it was still warm but not hot. But the chicken katsu was still crispy and juicy. The curry had such delicious flavour. Comfort food at its best. 

I took one star off for the tofu cheesecake. It had an odd flavour and texture... It's only redeeming quality was the graham topping."}
{"text":"Best staff ever! I wish more people knew about this place because the food is excellent and the employees are incredibly sweet! Must- go for those looking for a hearty, warm, and affordable food in the area"}
{"text":"The definition of a hidden gem. Got the pork katsu curry with cheese and it felt like I was consuming liquid gold. Do not underestimate its location and looks."}
{"text":"My office is connected to this building, so I've come in for the chicken katsu a couple of times and I agree, the sauce is really really good. Its around $9 all-inclusive so you can get better deals but the meal here is really fresh (katsu right out of the fryer every time!). 

What really takes the cake is how nice the people are here! You can tell that their traffic has increased substantially (sucks for the other two shops in this food court - they are seemingly never busy), and the man is constantly trying to fill orders as quickly as he can, but the workers are remember you and bring your order to you - in a food court! Really nice human beings."}
{"text":"Arguably the best katsu dishes in Toronto. Meats are fried to order so they come out hot and crispy! The curry is aromatic, savoury, slightly sweet, but sadly without a spicy option. Katsu orders are also served with coleslaw that works well with the other flavours. Pricing and portions are pretty reasonable for the average person."}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner tonight after hearing about it online. Had the pork Katsura curry. Was not disappointed. Curry was flavourful and pork cutlets were perfectly crispy and soft without being oily. Well worth the 9 dollars. The friendly owner  Ryan is from Malaysia and knows how to prepare Asian dishes well. You should try his home made jam. I'll return here. The Aura shops and food court where Kaiju is located is a bit tucked away under the Aura complex, but it lends itself to a unique atmosphere - a true hidden gem."}
{"text":"Really tasty Japanese food place hidden away in an otherwise barren Aura mall. It's a hidden gem, with unbelievably good service; the owner is super nice and they bring your food to your table if you are eating in. We received a free sample of the curry to try before we bought, which had us sold! They do take out which is convenient for students and lunch breakers. The curry dishes are all great, and the poutine is tasty and unique! Highly recommended. It is located in the  basement of the mall, and is accessed by elevator, so it is wheelchair accessible."}
{"text":"My wife and I were out exploring Toronto and found this place through Yelp. We ordered fish and pork katsu with curry sauce.  Food is great especially the curry sauce! Staff were also very attentive, friendly service, and fast service! Good place to have a quick meal!"}
{"text":"Tried Chicken Katsu Curry, exactly what I want. Not spicy and chicken is very tasty.
The food court is hard to find, better to enter the building from the door beside BMO."}
{"text":"This was a very tasty meal. The chicken is a little tough but a good size And plenty of flavour. I will return"}
{"text":"I got the chicken katsu curry. It was heavenly. The chicken & sauce go incredibly well with the rice & veggie side dishes. It left me oh-so-satisfied. I want to go back right this minute and have some more. I don't regularly come out to this neck of the city, but when I do I am coming back here!"}
{"text":"I met one of the owners of the restaurant when they first opened and he was handing out flyers. I didn't get a chance to try it until quite a while later and honestly, I'm blown away by how good everything is. From the food to the customer service- it really is a hidden gem. Located in the ground level of the Aura building, it really isn't a place you would venture to unless you were looking out for it. The food court doesn't get quite packed so there are a lot of seats to choose. 

As for the food, I will say it's one of the best curry chicken katsu I have ever had. Just writing about it makes me salivate, I should probably keep it that to myself. The katsu was crispy on the outside and moist- which is a rare feat. Typically most places that cook katsu overcook it to the point that it's so drying but it wasn't the case with Kaiju. The curry chicken katsu came with sides of coleslaw and rice, and the portions were perfect. 

The prices of the items on the menu were affordable and Kaiju would be a good place to come to for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular. 

Like other people, I had difficulty finding the entrance to Shops at Aura (I went down Gerrard looking for it but found a fire exit at best) before realising that the entrance was on Yonge. 

Once I was in the food court I was a bit worried as it does look pretty vacant and Kaiju is around the corner. The lady who was working there was very friendly and her demeanour definitely took away any uneasiness I had about the establishment (due to it being in an abandoned food court). The service was excellent and my food was ready quite fast.

I had the chicken katsu. It was spectacular. The chicken was perfectly crispy and the curry was sweet, spicy, savoury, and every bite was slightly different and incredibly complex. The whole dish was an adventure and I enjoyed every single bite of it-- I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service. I had the grilled fish. The curry is so yummy! I came Saturday late morning and pretty much had the whole food court to myself. It was a nice, relaxing experience."}
{"text":"Simply delicious curry katsu. I didn't even take a photo because I ate it so quickly! We shared a monster combo which included chicken, shrimp, and fish katsu. Wish they still had their noodles on the menu though."}
{"text":"I live in the Aura condo and never thought about trying out the food court below because of how empty it is. I heard about Kaiju from my cousin who said it was the best Jap curry he has had. I read the BlogTO article on the restaurant and decided to check it out. The food was delicious! We ordered the combo for 2 - it had fish, pork and shrimp and felt it was a good amount of food. The owner was also very nice and friendly and even brought the food to us. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a little gem hidden in downtown Toronto. You will find them under the Aura condominium complex. They were very welcoming and walked us through their menu selection. 

We went for the chicken katsu with a snack size of chicken karaage. 

The chicken there is very juicy and tasty and the cury sauce is delicious. 

Would recommend for any fans of japanese katsus. 

Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"I don't have words to describe how good the curry is here, amazing doesn't even cut it! Honestly I never would have tried this place as its in the basement of a pretty empty mall and it was kindu dark down there but I'm glad I did! The lady was super helpful and there's a book with pictures of all the dishes which makes it easier for a picky eater like me to choose what I want. 

I got the chicken dish and they even bring the food to where your sitting which is different than most mall food places. The portion is quite big and the Japanese curry oh man it was mouthwatering delicious. It wasn't on the spicy side which I liked and at the end of my meal I was licking the box, I honestly would have ordered another curry dish if I wasn't already so full. 

I highly recommend this place if your ever passing it on young and I will defiant be returning to try some of the poutine they make there!"}
{"text":"I have never thought I could find any good food in a generic food court. But I was proven wrong when I tried out this place. Fried fish Japanese curry is the best I have tried in the city. The secret is in the batter and the curry sauce!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place as I am getting my hair done right now. To my surprise, as I usually don't order fried food but I ordered the Chicken Katsu. I am happily enjoying the light and crispy texture of the chicken dipped in the gravy and light slaw. The owner was friendly and inviting as well."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and food was good. However, they indicated that the fish they used was \"sole\" when I asked the cashier lady what kind of fish it was. I've had sole and this was definitely not sole. It looked and tasted like basa to me. Nothing wrong with basa, but get your facts right!"}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5 stars.

Decent and very affordable take on katsu curry ($8) with incredibly friendly service in a deserted basement food court. Avoid the inauthentic char kway teow, which also doesn't have much flavour or wok hay.

Food: The tonkatsu was crispy and juicier than expected for a thinner cut. Surprisingly, it remained crispy for a very long time. The sauce was smooth and nicely spiced, but I had to adjust my expectations as Japanese-style curry typically has potato, onion, carrot in it. It's definitely not from a block of curry roux, which is rare in Toronto. There was not enough sauce for the rice and tonkatsu, so the lack of sauce felt stingy. (Extra sauce is available for $2.) The rice was long-grain (not the sticky medium-grain typical for Japanese-style curry), but of a lower-quality than expected. The coleslaw that accompanied the katsu curry was drenched in mayonnaise dressing. Overall, it's a decent katsu curry, but the little things detract from the delicious sauce.

The less said about the sad char kway teow the better. It had bell peppers. It didn't seem to have any soy sauce, light or dark, seasoning. Stick to the curries.

Service: The owner is such a nice man. Really refreshing to get such nice service and to see care put into the service of customers.

Ambiance: it's in a deserted basement food court where most of the stores in the mall are unoccupied/available for rent and the same goes for the stalls. Get it to go.

They also sell homemade kaya jam for $5/jar, which I sampled. It very eggy, but could be a bit smoother. Regardless, it's great to see a source for kaya jam in Toronto.

I would go again, request extra sauce and definitely try some of the other curries and purchase a jar of kaya jam. The price is also fantastic when you consider that you get a filling amount of food for less than $10 (even after tax)."}
{"text":"i missed the food from coco ichibanya in tokyo, and i watched this anime recently - shokugeki no soma and they made some tight ass anime curry. so, i had to go get some IRL curry and i was kinda skeptical cause i don't really vibe with pre-made j-curry packets like some other spots do. i get it, i'm lazy af too but don't slander the curry w some packets. packets ain't proper. but this shit!? this shit was SO proper, i swear to god. no pre-made packets from sanko here babyyyyy. go on and get yours+++

ps. sanko i love you, i just don't fuck with packets. thank you for always giving me milk tea for a discount :)"}
{"text":"We wanted to grab dinner but didn't feel like spending too much. This place was perfect, and went way above our expectations, we would have happily paid more for the food and service here. The food was delicious and quick, we had the chicken katsu curry and the sambai noodles (as recommended by the owner) which was brought directly to our table. The owner was lovely, he was friendly and genuinely took pride in what he was doing. He also gave us a loyalty card - 10th meal free? My bf and I are already planning on going back.  

Food: awesome
Service: Awesome
Value: EXCEPTIONAL

we need more places like this in Toronto"}
{"text":"Discovered a hidden gem at Gerrard/Yong St inside the Aura building, it's like a ghost town in the underground plaza with lots of empty stores. Don't let the atmosphere deter you from trying, the food is good and definitely worth coming back again and again. 

Food: 
Tried the chicken katsu.  It smelled so food and the curry was so flavorful.  I was worried that it would be spicy but instead it's what it should be, savoury with a little bit of sweet and spicy.  So good that I can't describe it.  Delicious curry paired with crispy chicken, I'm definitely coming back again soon to try the other meats and also their cheesecake.  

Service/Atmosphere: 
Although it's a food court with lots of empty stalls and tables, the food makes up for it.  The lady who was at the cashier came to ask me how my food was after at my table.  Great service!"}
{"text":"Like many of the other reviewers I had quite a difficult time finding this place (it is in a new and frighteningly abandoned-looking food court). I was happy with the quality of the food and very impressed with the level of service too.

I had the Chicken Katsu with gravy. The chicken tasted freshly fried which it was because you can see the frier clearly from the counter. The curry was thick, sweet, and different from other curries - kind of like half curry, half gravy. It was delicious and rich.

The owner Brian was friendly at the counter and helpful with recommendations too. What really impressed me was that he came out after I had a few bites to ask me for feedback, that he hoped everything was all right. Remember that the location is an empty foodcourt so I suppose he has a luxury down there that owners in say the eaton centre don't have, but it was still a very kind gesture!

I will be back and look forward to trying more items, like the Malaysian style noodles, that they recommended."}
{"text":"3 times already. Twice chicken katsu, once pepper chicken plus tofu cheescake. So far never disappointed."}
{"text":"The restaurant is hidden in a small food court near College Park.  Tasted both Pork Katsu and Fish Katsu today.  Fish Katsu is my favorite."}
{"text":"Great food! Japanese curry is yummy?? i also had the sambal ubon which is delicious! Definitely will revisit again?"}
{"text":"This little gem tucked away in the Aura building food court has the BEST fried fish with homemade curry sauce! The batter is light and crispy and the fish melts in your mouth :). Service is always incredibly friendly and the portion sizes are generous. The char kuey teow is great too. I'd totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! It is totally in a (seemingly) abandoned mall basement but the food was fabulous! The last time I had curry this good, I was in Japan! Highly recommended and the owner was very nice. Brought our food out to us and very knowledgeable about American Football as well. Excellent place, will definitely be back every time we're in Toronto!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in toronto 

i have been here over 10 times and every time had an amazing experience! the owners are very nice and always willing to help you find the perfect dish for you. 

the food is a great fusion of flavours from across Asia 

Dont let it being hidden away in the food court prevent you from trying this hidden gem"}
{"text":"A hidden Japanese Curry place that is absolutely delicious with excellent staff to match. The prices are very reasonable and have a wide selection if different meats to choose from.

I had the pork katsu curry. The crispiness was absolutely delightful and didn't feel extremely oily or heavy at all. The portioning is just right so you don't feel too stuffed or feel that there is too little. 
They also have some coleslaw, that at first didn't seem to match the meal, but because the dressing isn't heavy it worked nicely. 

One thing i do wish is that there were potatoes or carrots in the sauce, but this is just a personal preference.

The cashier was very informative about their meals, and was friendly enough to check up on my group and I to see how we were enjoying the food. Since this place is very quiet and low traffic, they even bring your order to your table, almost like a resturant.
One down side from the location is that, while near a pokestop (for all you pokemon go players) is that since it is a little underground Internet connection is not the strongest.

That being said, if you're ever in the area I do recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"Thanks to all the yelpers for helpful pictures and directions! I wouldnt of known this place existed otherwise.  Had the chicken katsu with extra rice. The chicken cutlet reminded me of what you'd get from a HK cafe.  Their curry is what sets them apart though.  When you first get it, don't rush and yam it all down.  Mix the curry with the rice evenly.  Take a bit of cutlet, a spoon of curry rice, then a spoon of slaw.   Repeat this cycle until done.  They also give a stamp card.  Buy 9 meals and the 10th one if free! I'm definitely coming back to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Really tasty curry sauce. Grilled chicken was really flavourful and tender.  Cashier was very friendly and helpful as to what to order.  Perfect lunch size portion and coleslaw was good too to balance the curry spice.

Too bad about the location, didn't even know there was a food court in this building! Building should advertise outside to promote foot traffic."}
{"text":"I tried the tofu dessert and it was very smooth and silky. It might not be a hit for people who aren't into a kind of gelatinous \"agar\" texture, however it becomes creamy when you crush it in your mouth and it's a lot less sweet than your standard New York cheesecake, without compromising texture. Kind of have to think of it as what it is: tofu cheesecake."}
{"text":"Fyi: This place is in the food court under the Marshalls/Bed Bath and Beyond building.

Would have received a 5 rating if the curry was a little less sweet...we ordered chicken katsu curry and fish fillet curry.  Fish fillet was pretty damn good. Nicely battered and soft insides. The chicken katsu on the otherhand was a little too crispy and more batter than meat. Overall, good portions and affordable ($8.50 each).

The owner was also really nice and brought our food to the table. Not sure if its because the food court is dead (7:30pm) or they do this during lunch rush as well?

Would come back for fish fillet curry. :)"}
{"text":"Tasty, curry katsu!

Found this little gem based on the reviews, and it didn't disappoint.  Location is a little out of the way in the food court of Aura building, away from the foot traffic of the PATH.

Our family of four shared the combo (shrimp, fish, and chicken katsu), pork katsu, and tori karaage curries.  Plenty to fill us all for lunch.  I noticed a sign for kaya (\"coconut jam\").  She gave us a little sample to try, so I picked up a couple of containers for $5 each. 

Hopefully when the future PATH extends to this building, more will discover this place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have been wanting to try this place for a long time but somehow never got the chance.

Let's just say I'm glad I tried it today, It was -16 out and the warm fish filet was perfect for this weather. The Japanese curry tastes really good, its a little sweet but very different from the Indian or Ethiopian curry you might have tried. I think more people have explained it here (and done a better job). But what they say about the crispy filet is absolutely right, it light and fried to perfection. Nothing like the fast food joints. She fried my fish right in front of me and since I was taking it home, she even told me how to warm up the sauce. Luckily for me I stay close so my food tasted pretty great even after I got home. I also got the special sauce and its HOT! I mixed it up with the curry and fish and it tasted really good.

The lady (I think she is the owner) was really sweet and kept talking to me and told me about how they started the place. The location is not the best for the store since its a tough find if you are new. But once you have been here you will have the entire food court to yourself and always have a chair to sit on. 

I'll definitely recommend this place to people.

Can't wait to try the other things on their menu :)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for quick service Asian food this is where you should go.  I had a noodle dish and it was very good, next time I go I am going to try the J-Curry.  The staff was all super friendly I want to go back just to see them again aha."}
{"text":"Pork Katsu curry was ok.  Despite Yelp categorizing this restaurant as MALAYSIAN and JAPANESE THERE IS NO MALAYSIAN FOOD here, only JAPANESE style food."}
{"text":"Seriously, hands down the best japanese curry. The owner Brian is a nice guy and came out to chat with me while I ate. I ordered the chicken katsu, and the portion was pretty big. Will definitely be back when in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"Seriously, you need to eat here

This is what you call a HIDDEN GEM! 
It's sad that it's so hidden, away from the crowds, and the unfortunate turnout for the shops at the Aura, makes it so much worse. 
None-the-less, their food (for what it is), is amazingggg. They fry the cutlets to order, so it's always super crisp, and never super oily. 

Everything is served rice, coleslaw, and swimming in a pool of delicious, flavorful curry. 
For a family-owned resto that's fairly tiny, the food packs some bold flavors!

It could use a little more rice; but for a oh so satisfying meal ~ $10, I`m not complaining.

The owner was so sweet, bringing the food to our tables, and returning to check on our meals.

I wish all the best to these guys, and will definitely frequent more often.

They definitely deserve more attention - check them out! Believe me, I was skeptical at first, knowing the lack of foot traffic, their food court gets.

Now I ask myself, \"Why did I wait so long?!\""}
{"text":"As most people say - it's tucked away in an empty food court, but the food is amazing (really crispy on the outside, soft on the inside).  Sauce was perfect, and it was very affordable."}
{"text":"Wow really a hidden gem.  Tried this for lunch today and got the chicken katsu $9.05 after tax a good portion and comes with some coleslaw.  The food was hot and made upon ordering so it's not sitting around.  The flavours were very good.  The staff are all very pleasant too.  I definitely recommend this!"}
{"text":"Curry is good, but don't have their fried udon, noodle or rice, they pour those into form container right from the wok (without putting down a foil at the bottom of the container. Also, I drank a lot of water  within two hours after the meal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My mister and I have been coming to eat here for 3 years, and every time it seems the curry gets better. Today I got the chicken katsu curry, and the curry was sweet with a hint of spice. The chicken was crispy and delicious, and the little salad they add in was sweet and matched the flavor of the curry perfectly. This is definitely the best curry I have ever had, anywhere. The owner is also so nice! He come to chat with us each time we come by. This place is so good we go out of our way to eat here when we can."}
{"text":"Before class, I would be around the Yonge and College area. Every time I yelped what restaurant there was nearby, Kaiju would be the first on the list. Located in the deserted basement of Shops at Aura, Kaiju shines a bright light.

Kaiju is located in the food court at Shops at Aura. When you finish ordering, the owner tells you to sit down. Thinking that its a food court, I sat close to the counter and waited for my order to be called. However, that did not happen as the owner came to me with my order. That was surprising. 

Now about the food. I ordered the pork katsu and it was fresh and hot. It was lightly battered which I like. The curry wasn't that spicy at all and mixing the curry with the rice and pork katsu was delicious. When I was in the middle of the meal, the owner came up to me and asked me how my meal was. I was quite shocked to see this and it really tells me that the owner really cares about his quality of food and customers. I told him that it was delicious and he told me where he learnt how to make the curry. So big props to the owner for doing that.

Also, while eating for 20 minutes at the food court, I observed that Kaiju was the only vendor getting business out of the other two vendors. 

If you are in the Yonge and Gerrard area during the weekday, go try out Kaiju. Its definitely a hidden gem in the deserted Shops at Aura."}
{"text":"The chicken katsu was delicious for $8. I've been to other places that serve this type of dish at a lesser quality for $11. The people working there were very friendly and heartwarming too! I had a very nice chat with the man up front and the cook. They gave me advice for uni and were very uplifting on an awful day. If you want a peaceful lunch and delicious food, Kaiju at the basement level of Aura is the way to go."}
{"text":"This is probably more like a 3.5 star rating than 4. We went for dinner after work on a Saturday. I had seen the excellent reviews but found myself in a quite deserted in the food court. Immediately, the vibe was a little bit off.

However, the lady behind the counter was really helpful. The food seemed to be prepared somewhat on the spot because it didn't come out right away like some fast food.

I had the fried chicken Katsu. It was good. Really good for fast food, but the expectations from yelp had thrown me off.

In general, a great place to go for probably a quick, tasty and inexpensive lunch. However, it's not one of those 'hidden gems' or anything like that."}
{"text":"I decided to try Kaiju after seeing the amazing reviews on here.The fish is perfectly done; crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The curry is so unique and not like anything I've tasted before. The coleslaw is creamy and crunchy in all the right ways. I also bought the Kaiju Poutine for a friend and he loved it. There were two other stores open in the food court and everyone seemed to be coming for Kaiju. The cashier/cook is very sweet as well. Overall, wonderful food, great customer service. No complaints at all!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem? Like actually hidden inside the basement food court of some condo near Gerrard street. They make bomb Japanese curries. The consistency was perfect, not too thick or watered down. Only thing is that they could use an extra strip or two of the meat of choice. Best eaten when its still hot, but that food court is too depressing to eat at. 

The lady working there never fails to try and strike a conversation with everyone. Always be like 'where you from, whats your major?'. Very friendly! Always keep in mind when doing takeouts to not shake it too much cause the sauce might leak."}
{"text":"Amazing curry sauce on the katsu. Katsu was crispy and went really well with the curry sauce. Rice cooked well and side of coleslaw was nice. The gentlemen and lady working were so friendly and even by to the food court to ask how everything was! Amazing restaurant service right in a food court. This place is a hard to find and not many other places are open around it but there was plenty of seating and less than a 4 min walk from Yonge and College so it's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"The reviews here don't lie--Kaiju has some delicious pork katsu! The meal comes with rice, veggies, side of choice (chose pork) and a large ladle of curry on the side so the crispy pork does not become soggy. The pork is fried in front of you, right behind the counter. It was very juicy and the batter was not too thick and amazingly not oily! The curry itself is not overwhelming but flavourful. Prices are around $8.50 a meal, coming to $9.60 with tax.

If you swing by, have a chat with the owner as well. Very genuine and friendly guy. 

The food court under Aura only had Kaiju open with two other Japanese shops and foot traffic through here is poor unfortunately. But do give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Chicken kaiju was tasty and there are plenty of meat. The habanero based hot sauce was great. The curry sauce was sweet but not overpowering, which was key. The food came with rice and some cabbage based salad with light mayo dressing. Overall, it was a satisfying meal and a good one if you want some simple fried meat on rice."}
{"text":"Tasty, fast, and affordable. It's in the food court of the Aura building, so it's easy to miss, but the food is delicious and hit the spot."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing 5 star reviews for a foodcourt joint? no way...

Absolutely deserving of them.

We came here as our last stop on our foodie adventure after walking in the rain for hours, feeling tired, and wet, and ordered the Monster combo TO GO.

While we waited, I noticed one of the cooks coming out to the food court tables asking everyone how everything was and if they needed anything else.  They treat their establishment like it's a restaurant even though it's inside a food court!

It takes me 1 hr to commute home from here, and even though my food was cold and wet from humidity (too lazy to heat) it tastes fantastic. the monster combo comes with fish, shrimp and pork (i think) tonkatsu, plus a thick curry and it surprisngly didnt leave a heavy feeling at all.

The slaw that comes with is not too saucy as well which is a plus!

Definitely a place I'm going to remember!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time for their malaysian fried sambal udon.  It's perfectly spiced and the portion sizes are quite generous.  The owner is a super sweet lady.  While I was waiting for my take out, she gave me a sample of the japanese curry on rice.  It was quite good, but i prefer the udon.

They also have a stamp card - after you buy a certain # of meals, you get one free!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot that's only a little off the beaten path. Avoid the crowds and pop by this little mom and pop shop that serves up amazing authentic Japanese curry. Shrimp and fish were really good and great value for money. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the food court location, this is some seriously good Japanese curry.

I've been here 3 times, and each time the curry Katsu was delicious. As soon as you order, your Katsu is dropped into the deep frier, ensuring a fresh beautifully prepared piece of meat. The accompanying curry sauce is the perfect compliment. At $10, the value is unbelievable.

I hope this place gets busier, because it deserves to stick around."}
{"text":"This place is a new benchmark for food courts IMO. I had this place book marked for a while as the first attempt to find it ended up being futile, 2nd attempt was near closing time. Finally this attempt was fruitful. 
First the location is a dead spot as mentioned earlier for all cellphone related stuff so bring some media on your mobile device if you want to kill some time here.
I ordered a Chicken Katsu (Kaiju Spicy) my dinning companions ordered a fish and Mild Katsu.
I was delighted to see that our food was fried after we ordered it so I knew it would come piping hot. 
The serving size is decent. The kaiju curry packed a wallop initially, though mellowed out after a bit as my taste buds would have gone numb I suppose. The Katsu is done quite well and the curry being good .Nice even cut and a good crisp on the meat.  I am not an expert on Japanese curry as have mostly tried the boxed versions in the past.  4 Stars here.
I tried the fish for taste as well and it was decent.  I would say this place is worth a try and will even put some nearby dine in spots to shame when one takes the value proposition into account. 
I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"hidden gem definitely! the curry is delicious although I wish the portion size was a little bigger. have tried a few other items on the menu but always go back for the curry"}
{"text":"The food was delicious - fried pork, chicken and shrimp came out perfect.  Lady at the cash was very friendly.

The basement mall looked deserted though and not aerated properly."}
{"text":"I would have never found this place if I hadn't read about it on Yelp first. Hidden underground at the Aura condo, Kaiju is tucked away in the corner of the food court. This place definitely constitutes a hidden gem.

I got the chicken katsu curry and it was so good! Probably the best Japanese curry I've ever had - it was a sweet, salty and rich, and only a slightly spicy. The cutlet was breaded and perfectly crispy (although I wish the cut was a little thicker). And they give you a side of salad (kind of like a coleslaw) to cut through the rich flavour of the curry. Added bonus: it was under $10 for a good sized portion that's perfect lunch!"}
{"text":"Small portion size.  Curry was way to sweet and the lady gave me only a ladle of the curry which barely covered half of the rice. After seeing all the good reviews about this place I decided to give it a try. Disappointing. Would not visit again."}
{"text":"Finally!  I've been wanting to try this subterranean place for the longest time!

The location isn't the easiest to find, but at the same time, if you've got a half-decent sense of direction, you will eventually stumble upon it.

The nice man (Brian) greeted me as I stood there, staring at the menu, trying to decide what to order.  He asked if it was my first time there, and I said, yes.  I told him my Yelp friend(s) recommended it.  :)

After quite a bit of friendly conversation, I decided on the combo for two.  Oh yes... Let me try all the fried goodness you have to offer!  

Portions are great for the price!  I had to get take out and rode my bike home and everything held up just fine.  The crispiness was there.  The curry sauce was rich and flavourful.  I don't normally eat a lot of rice but damn, that sauce made it worthwhile.  The side coleslaw was alright...  It felt good to consume some veg I guess.  

I am definitely a fan and would recommend this place for a tasty meal with no wait in line, but just be prepared to eat in a deserted food court setting.

I'm giving 4 stars for now.  I need to try their other dishes to see how they stack up.

I sure hope this place stays afloat!  Spread the word and go get your Kaiju fix!!!"}
{"text":"Very hidden but very friendly mom 'n pop service and delicious japanese curry! The breaded pork was fried fresh and arrived hot."}
{"text":"Interesting hideaway place in the new food court. I came here because of the Yelp buzz and had great expectations. I ordered the chicken tonkasu curry based on the owner/ counter persons suggestion. 

It was very different than any tonkasu or curry I have eaten. Very sweet sauce with coleslaw and big pieces of chicken. It was good. 

The service is really what took this place up a notch though. The counter lady was so friendly to everyone and came around with Halloween candy after I had finished."}

After shopping at the Eaton Center, we were hungry.  So we decided to have something to eat nearby.  I checked on yelp and came across Kaiju.  I haven't heard about this restaurant before however Yelpers say it's good...so...what were we waiting for!?  

We walked straight to Gerrard street but we weren't sure how to get to the restaurant.  It was my bad because I was very hungry so I didn't read reviews well.  I checked it again..and..ya! We found it :) 

Kaiju is a food court restaurant located at the basement of AURA CONDO.  The food court was very quiet and there were many empty units that were waiting to be rented.  The basement looks dark and not lively!  We weren't sure if that was the reason why there were many empty units still.

When we got there, we were surprised because there were only three stores opening at the time.  We went straight to Kaiju and ordered the combo for 2 ($19).  It comes with all deep fried stuff ; 1 fish fillet, 4 shrimp and a choice of chicken or pork.  We got pork, shrimp and fish.  The curry was different from other places I had before.  However, I'm not an expert at Japanese curry.  I can't tell that it's the best but we like it.  

The best part was the service though.  The guy who served us the food (he brought the food to our table with drinks we ordered), I assume he was the owner.  He's very nice and friendly.  He came to talk with us during the meal. I think it's part of his marketing and it's a good one.  He knows how to spread the words and keep customers.  I'm pretty sure that one of the reasons he received good reviews is because he tries to engage conversation, introduce himself and the restaurant, also gives out a samples.  He makes customers feel comfortable and want to come back again.  He told me that he is from Malaysia but has been living here for more than 20 years. He gave us jam sticks to try how sweet of jam he made (--\") now I want it more. Haha..
 
I will go back there again to try Tofu Cheese cake.  He said they sell it only on Saturday :) See you there!"}
{"text":"With Kaiju closing at the end of October, we headed back for some more Japanese curry goodness. In addition to the \"Monster Combo\" (which is a great value for two people who want to try a variety of different types of meats), we got the Tori Karaage. While the chicken karaage \"bites\" they sell have a more breaded exterior, the tori bites are crunchier (similar to the katsu). 

We also got a slice of the tofu cheesecake. As someone who hates tofu, I absolutely LOVED this dessert. The tofu flavour is very subtle, but it's mostly a cheesy/eggy taste that you get. 

Overall, I'm going to be extremely saddened that Kaiju is closing, but after speaking to the people who work there, they ARE actively looking for a new location (hopefully it's still downtown!). I wish them all the best - there are a lot of people who love Kaiju!"}
{"text":"Deep in the heart a hidden, rather sad and somehow still incomplete mall in the basement of the ominous Aura tower on Yonge lies a delicious hidden gem of a curry stall. 

Kaiju offers tasty, filling and cheap dishes- I've tried the shrimp and katsu chicken, and both are crispy, hot and surrounded by a unique and sweet/spicy sauce I cannot easily describe but easily ate to bursting. 

The service, too, is friendly--- the owner customized my meal to be heavier on the salad and hand delivers meals to the table. He's always super friendly and steadily busy despite the difficult location for walk ins. 

Highly recommend this place and will 100% return!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Kaiju was when I was walking along Yonge Street and was offered a free sample of chicken katsu bite. I was impressed with the earnest friendliness of the employees who led us in a personal tour from street level to the subterranean food court where Kaiju is located.

Today I decided to try out a full meal for a quick after work dinner. Chicken is very high quality meat - no fatty parts at all, just white breast meat. It was hot and juicy. I was pretty full at the end but I don't know if someone who has a bigger appetite would be. Curry sauce is pretty good. I wish it came with better veggies instead of tasteless Cole slaw."}
{"text":"This is very hidden, in the bottom floor of a mall, located in the food court (almost everything else is closed). If it weren't for Yelp, I wouldn't have found it. I heard great things about the curry here so I decided to come try the chicken katsu.  It's not your average curry, it's more sweet than spicy (Japanese curry--sweet vs Indian curry--spicy), not spicy at all. The chicken was breaded very well, nice and crispy, also not dry. It comes with rice and cloeslaw cabbage. The price is about $8 something, not too bad."}
{"text":"When I first tasted the curry, it was a bit surprising. There was an immediate sweet flavour, which I wasn't expecting, but at the same time it was overpowering and it made it actually quite delicious and unique. The pork katsu was perfectly cooked. Loved the side of cabbage. I'd come back"}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken katsu in the city! Omg I'm so happy I came. The location is not so great but I don't mind it, at least it's not a crowded food court. Love it! 5/5 recommend."}
{"text":"Discovered this gem after reading about it on BlogTo. What an amazing find! Delicious, amazing, authentic Japanese curry at food court prices and large portions. I had the tonkatsu curry, and everything was just perfection. Definitely need to go back and try all their other dishes. 

I'd worry for Gyugyuya, coz I find this place more tastey, less expensive, and has larger portions. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I finally tried Kaiju and loved it! 

Great service for a fast food joint and our meals were made fresh to order.  This is relatively plain but not boring comfort food.

I would love to try the fish next time or maybe the Malaysian noodle dish. 

One gripe is that I wish the coleslaw/cabbage salad was a bit tangier. This probably isn't authentic to the Japanese curry experience; it's just something that is to my taste. 

Highlight: Chicken or Pork katsu (duh)"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! I absolutely love this place. A great value for your $$$$, food is sooooo good. Been this currytwice already. Got fried fish curry. The fish is just perfectly fried, and curry is awesome. Even though I am more I like it hot girl, I absolutely loved it, and sure will be back for more.
The service is also so good. they are super friendly, chat with you, and if they see you are there for the first time, always come and ask how you liked it. A hidden gem of the city. go and try it for yourself. You are welcome."}
{"text":"Eating amazing Chicken Katsu curry, best I've ever had! Kaiju Toronto is an underground mall called Shops at Aura"}
{"text":"Been trying to find a decent Chicken Katsu Curry in Toronto and one at Kaiju is amazing! The food court was empty though if you're looking for atmosphere. I'll definitely be back to try some of their Malaysian dishes."}
{"text":"It can be a bit confusing when you walk through. Located in the Aura shopping centre; it's lined with empty or closed shops selling random knick knacks. But tired from the late night and motivated by hunger, we persisted. 

We came to your typical underground mall cafeteria and as we approached  - we were greeted by a very friendly owner. We ordered curry with the mixed katsu option and we were not disappointed. 

The owner personally came over to deliver our food even though it was a food court and he came over to ask how everything was. He seemed passionate and enthusiastic with his work and is always ready to talk and give you a slice of his life story. The service and food was great and you're only reminded that you're eating in a food court from the Styrofoam container and plastic utensils. 

Excellent for a quick delicious bite!"}
{"text":"Hosted a Meetup lunch social at this location on a Thursday.

Located in the food court at Aura concourse, it isn't as busy compared to other nearby food courts downtown, such as the College Park food court.

After placing an order, they'll give you a number, saying they'll call out the number when it's ready. We sat near the venue and the owner personally brought over the meal, which is pretty nice; you will never get this kind of service in any other food court.

Plastic fork and knives are provided, and disposable chopsticks are available by request.

Prices at this time start at $8.50 for a combo which typically comes with rice, salad, curry sauce, and a meat of your choice. They also offer appetizers. Note that the menu is constantly changing, so the existing photos are outdated. No malaysian dishes were available at this time as they are focusing more on the japanese dishes.

I ordered the Tori Karaage combo and enjoyed it. The portion size is alright, though I feel the salad could be better. In terms of budget lunches, this is on the higher end for pricing.

Would return."}
{"text":"This place is randomly tucked away in a dead food court, but the food is so dang good! I shared the combo with a friend. It came with chicken, shrimp and fish katsu and two containers of rice with curry and coleslaw. Every piece of katsu was juicy and crisp. I loved the flavour of each that I can't decide which I liked most. The curry was on the sweeter side, but I love how it's made from scratch. I wished there was more curry to rice ratio, but for the price of this dish it was well worth it. The coleslaw is on the bland side, but it was a nice addition as everything else was super flavourful and a little heavy. They mentioned they will be moving to a new location. I just hope it's closer to the financial district because I would definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"The Aura Condo business complex is such a failed enterprise. 

When they were building it, they sold it as a vibrant place of business, a small mall that would compete with the likes of College Park to the north. However, when you drop by, you will notice the place to be half moribund and borderline depressing. Sure, there are a few stores which seem like they are barely clinging to life, like Marshall's, and in fairness, there a few restaurants at street level which honestly seem to be doing well. However, go the basement level and you will see half-bored-out-their-mind store owners just standing there, probably thinking about how bad of an idea was to get a lease at the Aurora. 

You feel kind of guilty since when you walk by and make eye contact, some owners will outright ignore you but some will spruce up, and give you a look that sort of says, \"Here! Come! PLEASE, enter my store! Check my wares.\" Then it will change to slight disillusion when you walk right past their store front.

Their underground food court is pretty much more of the same. Pretty abandoned, with tons of store spaces either closed or outright empty... it sort of looks like a ghost town. 

Except around Kaiju.

There is always someone coming in and buying some of their delicious Japanese curries. Which is by far what this stall is known for. 

I will admit, when a friend of mine told me it was a \"must try,\" I definitely had my reservations. He works nearby and he goes about 2-3 times a week, which knowing his tastes in food, it is quite the praise. 

I am not a big fan of food court food since it is hardly healthy, nor filling, and the quality tends to be all over the map. I have always thought of them as emergency food stations. Places you purchase food only when you are desperate, and are looking to to avoid hypoglycemia... if I was diabetic. 

Anyway, so I dropped by and tried a few of their curries and damn, they are delicious. Japanese curries are not known for being spicy, regardless, each bite was full of flavour. Tried a few dishes over time and the chicken katsu is definitely better than what you think you would get from a food court. Tried to purchase their cheesecake but they never had it the times when I dropped by. :-(

Still, whenever I am in the neighbourhood and hungry, I drop by to get my fix. Highly recommended and if the word of mouth continues, and they expand they menu a tad, then perhaps in the future, Kaiju might leave the sinking ship that is the Aurora and move into its own premises.

As it stands, if you like Japanese curry, do yourself a favour and drop by, have a bite. ^_^"}
{"text":"The food is simple but everything is made to perfection. I had a malaysian fried rice noodle. The chicken is tender, noodles are chewy and deciduous. The owners are very nice. I am definitely going back to this place again."}
{"text":"One of my friends recommended this place and I finally managed to catch it open when I  was hungry and nearby. I got the grilled chicken, and don't know how they cooked the chicken but it was juicy and tender. I really wish they had a storefront somewhere less glum, because they deserve a line in front of their store. Way better than any other Japanese curry place downtown. Step aside gyugyuya, You waste of space."}
{"text":"Definitely a diamond in the rough. Walking through the deserted and slightly creepy aura condo basement made me feel like i was in a scene from the Walking Dead with essentially every store being apocalyptically deserted. Kaiju's pretty easy to find and the owners are really kind people, it felt like a mom and pop neighbourhood joint but in a creepy downtown basement which was a trip. Food was awesome, very fresh and homemade tasting. Id never heard of Japanese curry before but it was like a tangy bbq sauce gravy which went amazing with the fresh, deep fried breaded fish filet and the creamy coleslaw was a great choice of side. My boyfriend didnt even want to go, the whole idea seemed odd to him but at soon as my food came his eyes widened and he had a bite and immediately ran off to order his own plate. For someone who had to be dragged here he sure was raving about it all weekend and wants to come back asap! It might be located in a food court but its definitely not food court quality so I think the prices are quite fair because youre not going to get food like this at the urban eatery. They were sold out of their tofu cheesecake which was disapointing but ill try again next time! If youre debating wether to go or not, GO, you wont be sorry."}
{"text":"Honestly, I've had this place bookmarked ever since it opened so I was pretty excited to finally try it today.

After reading fellow Yelper reviews, I just about expected everything. So yes, I can testify to the comments about how the store is run by a friendly and cute little Asian couple. The lady on the till was very nice and personally came to our table (in the food court) to ask how we were enjoying the food. So overall service was pretty great.

However, I found the food to be a bit disappointing. Having maintained such a high rating after so many months of running, I was anticipating a dish that would \"wow\" me. Despite the photos that would argue otherwise, I had hoped that the taste of the curry would trump it's presentation. My verdict: ehhhh..  I would give the food a 3.5/5. I had the chicken karaage curry ($9.61 tax included) and it was just alright. The chicken was moderately tender, not the melt in your mouth type, and the curry was a bit on the sweeter end. I've definitely had better karaage and the overall dish wasn't as hot as I had hoped it to be. Why I rounded down to a 3 star, however, is because of the rice. My greatest complaint would be that the rice was too soggy and had clumped together instead of standing alone as individual grains. I also would have appreciated more coleslaw as I felt the meal was lacking in vegetables.

The other reason why I rounded down is because I am now insanely thirsty. I haven't been able to stop drinking water since this meal and now my lips have this mild burning sensation. Owing to the deep fried nature of the karaage along with the MSG in the curry, I probably should've seen this coming. Regardless, this is definitely not a pleasant feeling."}
{"text":"This is probably the best fast food curry outside of Japan that I have had in Toronto. I go to Japan every year, and a must stop is always a curry shop (fast food style or super traditional). In comparison, Kaiju is great quality. 

We ordered the combo curry, switched the pork katsu to the chicken katsu (free!). It also came with 4 shrimps and 1 fish cutlet. The chicken was good quality, no extra fatty spots, chewy yet tender. The fish was crispy on the outside and moist and hot on the inside. Great flavour and obviously made with fresh fish. The shrimp was flattened in a way to optimize tenderness, but was my least favourite. I was also given their home made hot sauce to add to my curry. The hot sauce was a great addition, it added spice, fragrance and also brought out the sweet flavour of the Japanese curry. Definitely give it a try!

We also tried the tofu cheese cake. It's not my favourite. The cake was more gelatinous (jello) than creamy."}
{"text":"I feel comfortable giving this place 5 stars after only one visit. I so enjoyed the Chicken Katsu curry, that I'm certain I need to come back here. This is one of the two best places in the area (Kabul Express is the other), and I do not doubt that you will be satisfied with the food. Japanese curries are inherently bland, so it takes some art to make them as intriguing as this one"}
{"text":"The chicken katsu is delicious!  The coleslaw complimented it well but the portions are pretty averaged size, if not a bit small. I would have liked it if the portions were longer."}
{"text":"Love Japanese Curry!  Especially the fried fish fillet curry!    Comes with rice and side cole slaw."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday around 4 pm. Was looking for a place close to the subway line and this hit the spot (as well as all the positive reviews). Its not overly hard to find as it is one only a handful of food shops within the plaza's  food court area. There were about 10 people eating when me and a friend arrived. Ordered the chicken katsu while friend ordered the pork katsu. Everyone working at the shop is super friendly, and it is basically run as a sit down restaurant with the food being brought to you while you sit nearby. Food came promptly and was hot. The pieces of katsu were quite large, and had a nice crunch to it. The curry based sauce on the side complemented it well. I'm a big fan of Japanese curry because it if flavourful but is still tolerable. The rice was a pretty standard portion and was cooked well. One thing I wish would be altered was the slaw on the side, which was a bit out of place. I'd prefer a miso soup but overall the dish (box) was still nice. For 8.75, I'm not sure you could find a tastier and larger portion of katsu anywhere else. Will be returning if in the eaton centre area, which is more often then I'd like to admit. Nice!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken katsu with curry and the katsu was beyond perfect. Fotlr the best Katsu in Toronto, I would say the price was amazing. I 100% definitely recommend you to check out this place if you are a fan of Japanese food."}
{"text":"Really good chicken katsu!! perfectly breaded and isn't leaking of oil. The curry was very delicious too! The location's really convenient (and i think a great place to study for students -the food court is literally empty).

The owners are really friendly too :)"}
{"text":"Great service and the food was good. They need to find a better way to place the food as they need a separate section for sauce. They could also provide more rice and cole slaw because it is a little on the expensive side."}
{"text":"I'm always willing to admit when I'm wrong, which is almost never. \"All Star\" by Smash Mouth IS actually a work of musical genius, and John Carter IS a cinematic masterpiece. I'll fight you.

Anyway, today I went back to Kaiju and realized that the light, refreshing, and crunchy coleslaw (which I had previously mistakenly asserted should be a green salad) is actually the PERFECT accompaniment to curry. In my case, curry on impeccably-fried fish (now $9.60). Rich, hot curry which we've all established is super ridiculously delicious. So my stupid 4.5 stars should be a 5. I apologize.

My only remaining complaint/suggestion is the eco-hostile use of Styrofoam boxes for dine-in customers."}
{"text":"Another small hidden gem located right inside the Aura building at yonge and gerrard. The food court inside this buildling is quite small with Kaiju and another japanese and korean foodcourt stall. I've heard many good reviews about the pork katsu curry here and had to try one night after work.

The prices are fair, comes up about 9 dollars for a meal. Comes with a side of coldslaw, rice, two big heeping spoonful of curry and a piece of meat. Taste wise, it was very rich. I quite enjoyed the curry because it was the perfect thickness and it was not spicy at all. The meat was also cooked to perfection with the right amount of crispiness. 

Definitely will return when craving a cheaper meal."}
{"text":"If you're in the area and looking for cheap, good eats, this is your place.
Not much in terms of ambiance (in a lonely looking food court), but as other reviewers have mentioned the food is good and the service is great. A really warm and friendly lady helped us, and recommended the fried fish curry to me. Loved it! Crunchy, flaky, hot and satisfying."}
{"text":"Find this place. You'll be amazed. Had the chicken katsu curry and everything about it was amazing. From the steam that escaped the container to the delicate spiciness in the otherwise sweet sauce. Best food court food that beats many standalone restaurants! Also tried the tofu cheesecake and it was also delicious! Not to mention a huge serving. :) 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Amazing food, their Karaage is so good as well as their curry. It's a shame Aura doesn't get enough traffic."}
{"text":"Secret underground Asian food court? Yes please.
Meats are fried fresh and are nicely breaded.
Actual curry sauce is quite good. A tad sweet but overall well balanced.
Have and will continue return."}
{"text":"Had the Japanese curry and Singapore noodles. I liked the noodles more (probably the only person to say so out of the group). Good portions!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute best Japanese curry restaurant in Toronto, and one of my favourite places to grab a quick lunch. Kaiju is incredibly hard to find at first, being located in a somewhat creepy, barely inhabited underground mall. It's definitely worth the journey though, as the food and the service are both far better than you would expect in a food court stand.

The tonkatsu curry is my standard order, for good reason. The pork cutlet is perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and perfectly juicy inside. The skin, unlike so many other tonkatsu, adheres to the meat instead of falling apart at the first bite. The curry itself is rich and flavourful, as well. I'd also recommend their Kaiju poutine, although it runs a little too large to be a side for one person. I never got the chance to try their Malaysian menu when they had it, but it must not have been too popular because I noticed that they've removed it the last few times I was there. 

The owners are the standout thing about Kaiju, in my opinion. They always make an effort to get to know you, and genuinely try to remember you the next time you visit. If they're not too busy, they also carry your food out to where you're sitting too.

I'm always worried that Kaiju isn't getting enough business and that they'll be forced to shut down or move away, so hopefully they keep getting business from the positive word-of-mouth. The only downside is that, for a food court place, they take their time to make your food and can get a little bogged down when the lines are long, but it's definitely more than worth the wait if you have the time."}
{"text":"Frankly, if it weren't for Yelp I wouldn't have found this place nearby. Not that this place is hard to find, but how many people of the general public actually know there's a food court in the basement of Aura condos? Such a shame for location really... property management really needs to think of a way to promote this area more for the benefit of the retail and food vendors downstairs. 

On a happier note, food at Kaiju is bang on -  you get your bang for the buck. I haven't had authentic and tasty japanese curry in awhile and this place gets it just right. For $8 each I tried the fish curry on rice, both fried and grilled, and food quality exceeded expectations both times.  The fried one was fresh and crispy, and the grilled option was equally flavourful (although not quite as satisfying as the fried option...) 

The owner is exceptionally friendly. It's fast food and in a food court setting, but given that it seems to be the busiest of the three food vendors available, the owner offered to bring our food to the table. Another time when we went after hours not knowing it closed at 8pm, he still offered to take our food order.

I will forever save the $4 spent on Glico premade japanese curry mix and come here instead whenever the craving kicks in."}
{"text":"Holy Batman, this place has a mean Japanese Curry!  In all honesty, I prefer their blend over the selection in J-Town!  It makes my tummy happy knowing that such a place exists downtown."}
{"text":"We had chicken and pork katsu. The curry sauce was the best part. It's very flavourful and has a hint of spicy heat to it. The meat portions are generous and fresh. 

The rice is plain but mixes well with the sauce. The coleslaw is probably the low part of the plate. Definitely room for improvement on the coleslaw. 

The owner is super friendly and seeks to make you happy. If you're in the area give them a try for lunch."}
{"text":"After reading Spice City Toronto's blog review, I went there for lunch today. I had the Katsu (pork cutlet) in curry.  It was served with rice and a thimbleful of cole slaw. I really liked my first taste of Japanese-style curry; it's aromatic and quite mild. The cutlet was perfectly fried and coated in crunchy panko.  The Aura mall is still waiting for the majority of its tenants.  I counted four open restaurants and I think there are about eight unoccupied food court spaces still to come. My lunch was worth the search down to the basement."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the restaurant atmosphere was very nice. The servers are all really friendly. It's a must go place in Toronto for good Katsu dishes!"}
{"text":"This place is the definition of hidden jem. It is hidden in this forgotten plaza under the aura condo but no one forget Kaiju. I went and got the highly recommended fried fish fillet curry rice and my friend got the fried shrimp curry rice. The lady behind the counter was so sweet and came out to deliver our food. She even told us about what is most popular. The fish was so tender and flaky with a crisp fried batter on the outside. It was served with cold slaw and rice surrounded by a pool of curry. The curry was sweet and peppery hot. Kaiju should be a restaurant more than just a food court stand. The price was good for the portion size. Overall, i enjoyed the solid meal and left very satisfied. I will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Best Japanese Curry in TO - tried the fish, chicken and pork all delicious! Wish they delivered, and hope they open a second location!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious lunch here today! The pork katsu is delicious and prices reasonable. Spoke with one of the ladies there and looked forward to going back to try their Malaysian specialties!!"}
{"text":"Prior to visiting, I heard great things about Kaiju but was a bit skeptical. I mean, it's a fast food joint located in a nearly deserted food court...how great can it really be? After taking my first bite, I knew instantly how wrong I was and immediately regretted not coming here sooner. 

I ordered the chicken katsu curry and it was one of the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. The chicken katsu was made fresh to order...perfectly crispy on the outside with moist and tender chicken on the inside. It did not feel or taste oily as katsu sometimes does. The katsu was paired with rice, slaw and a healthy portion of Japanese curry. For those who have not tried Japanese curry, it has a similar consistency to gravy and tastes sweeter and more mild than its Malaysian & Thai counterparts. The curry here was perfect and very reminiscent of the ones in Tokyo. The slaw was refreshing and even the rice tasted better than average. 

I also have nothing but positive things to say about the service. Amazing service in a food court...strange, I know. The friendly man behind the counter was helpful and patient as I decided my order and brought the meal right to my table, complete with utensils and napkins! He made a round later to check that I enjoyed my meal and thanked me as I exited the food court. I heard positive things about the woman who works here too. 

Amazing food, amazing service...sketchy venue haha. Either way, I am excited to come back to try more!"}
{"text":"I've been missing Japanese katsu curry for a very long time. I expected more from this place. Curry portion is very small considering the price. Overrated. Sorry. Not the best curry I've had. I tried to like it. Seems pretty popular with other people though."}
{"text":"After seeing so many reviews and notifications of other people rating Kaiju 5/5, I had really high expectations because my favourite food in the world is pork cutlet and my second favourite would be curry rice. The location of the restaurant is pretty hard to find and is located in pretty much an abandoned area, but if you follow the instructions given by the other Yelpers here, you'd definitely be able to find the place.

The restaurant is owned by a man (perhaps in his 30's and 40's) and he spent a lot of time talking to me about why I came and how I found out about Kaiju. I decided to get the cheese on top of the regular pork cutlet curry rice as I was feeling adventurous that day and followed the recommendation of the owner. 

Overall, I would say it was definitely yummy but it didn't blow my tastebuds away. It had a sweet after-taste which I found pretty interesting and distinctive compared to the other Japanese curry rices that I have had in the past. The cutlet was cooked very well and the sauce itself was well-done. This was a solid 4/5 but I am not sure if I would trek all the away from the core of DT for Kaiju again."}
{"text":"I would go back for the curry....it's really good.  They can deep fry really well too.  (not too greasy oil was clean so the food wasn't dark but golden)  But I think I'd try something non deep fried next time.  The curry itself was quite complex...having eaten many indian curries and other asian curries (thai, malay, indonesian etc)...it was a deeply satisfying kind of curry sauce.  Now if only they had a good vegetarian option ...their website has eggplant and cheese....not sure about the cheese for the curry...but anyways, you get the idea."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical about this place since it's located in an almost abandoned food court, but decided to come try it after reading all the glowing reviews.  As a first timer, I feel like I HAD to get a katsu dish since that's what this place is known for and went for the FRIED FISH FILET $9.04 (after tax) and it was fantastic!  There was only 1 person ahead of me in line when I came on a Tuesday around noon.  The food came out pretty quickly after I ordered (about 5 minutes).  The fish was fresh, crispy and tasty.  Really great light breading and not greasy.  The curry sauce was great with rice and had just the right amount of spiciness.  The coleslaw was a nice vegetable compliment to the meal.  I would definitely come back to try the chicken or pork katsu.

There is plenty of seating in the food court area.

LOCATION:  Near the corner of Yonge and Gerrade.  Look for the building with the Marshall and Bed Bath & Beyond sign.  When you see the \"The Shops at Aura\", you're at the right place.  There's an escalator that goes down to the food court area.  There are 2 other restaurants opened in the food court offering sushi and ramen.

They take Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"Went to Kaiju for lunch on a weekday and the food court was almost empty. Ordered pork katsu curry on rice and it was really good compare to other food court type of places. The price is a little more expensive than I expected but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"So I was Yelping a few days ago and came across this gem. I said to my friend, I found a place that claims to have the best chicken katsu in town...you want to check it out. So we went.  First of all, let's talk about this secret little food court. Upon arrival, I was a little skeptical as this place was in some underground food court and very little people there. The staff was super friendly and answered all my questions  without irritation.  Come to find out they have been in this location for 3.5 years, i was like what the heck...where have I been.  Anyway, so we order our food and they cook it right in front of us which normally I get skedged out about but not this time.  Cut to the chase...this was some damn good food. So they give you this huge chicken cutlet, deep fried and served on a bed of the most awesome curry sauce ever (it was slightly spicy but sweet at the same time), along with steamed rice, and coleslaw.  So good!!!!! I will be heading there at least once a week to enjoy this dish. Just under $10 for the dish."}
{"text":"You may know Kaiju from watching Pacific Rim. I curiously arrived at this establishment looking for a cut of Godzilla but they disappointingly only sell domesticated animal meat and seafood. 

Katsu is a type of Japanese cuisine involving deep frying panko-covered meat. It's sort of like a German schnitzel but it's different (otherwise the restaurant would be called Jäger). 

Kaiju is located in an incredibly depressing basement shopping plaza of a new Toronto condo development called Aura.  You wouldn't know that this hidden gem was located here. In fact, even if you do know, you might get lost trying to find the food court. 

Kaiju's known for Katsus and you can really tell why. It's perfectly crunchy and deep fried in what is the epitome of delicious crispness. There's various options for Katsu; I had pork, shrimp and fish. All were equally good but I'm partial to the pork. Underneath the Katsu is some Japanese curry sauce which is unlike the type you would get from a Glico package.  For the uninitiated, Japanese curry savoury with a hint of sweetness.  It's generally less spicy than other curries but it can vary.  Upon ordering, you have the option of intensifying the spiciness but I give the max spiciness a two chillies out of five. It was a slight tickle to the tongue.  

Asides from the curry, they also sell other Asian food. I've tried Mama's chicken and Sambal Udon.  Mama's chicken is deep fried with a sweet and savoury batter. There's some cooked cucumber and onion to balance the chicken but it was a bit too heavy as a main dish. It also came with a side of rice.  Lastly, I also tried the Malaysian Sambal Udon. Unfortunately, it was a bit too salty and wasn't very memorable. 

Overall:
- Katsu (any): A+
- Mama's chicken: B
- Sambal Udon: C+

Bottom line: amazing Katsu dishes which I will come back for. I'm more hesitant to try the other non-Katsu dishes."}
{"text":"I love their curry, and friendly service. Came here to eat like 5 times already and never disappointed."}
{"text":"Kaiju is one of two places I frequent when I am within walking distance to it. You might call Kaiju a hidden gem, because it is almost hidden in the lower level of the Aura Tower on Yonge Street, sharing the same address as Madonna's Hard Candy and Bed Bath & Beyond. 

Kaiju specialises in Japanese katsu curry and I've only ever come here for the curry, but then one friend just so happen didn't feel like curry, so for one time only, I've also tried their crispy fried chicken.

After coming her a few times, I finally noticed that they were also selling kaya jam for $5. It just so happened that I have been having a craving for kaya toast. This finding of kaya jam is probably the best find. The kaya jam is made by the owner's sister, homemade and only put a few on sale every day. If you don't know what kaya jam is, you don't know life. Best with toast with tons of butter. 

The food is consistent every time I come here. And the owner / chef and his sister are always offering us a taste of something else. 

Kaiju is one of two regular places I eat at when I am within walking distance of this place, too bad it's not opened on Sundays."}
{"text":"It doesn't even make sense how good this place is at what it does. It was no exaggeration the best service I've received at any Asian cuisine restaurant I've ever been to. And it was in an empty food court in arguably the worst \"mall\" in Ontario. 

The Shop at Aura are known as one of the biggest failures possible. When we went searching for Kaiju, we thought we might be murdered with no one to hear our screams 90's horror movie style. Kaiju was one of only 2 places in the food court open and we had to pass by dozens of dark, empty store fronts with \"for lease\"  signs in the window. 

When we arrived, the lady behind the counter asked us if we'd been there before and then explained to us what Japanese curry is, including its comparison to Thai or Indian curry and complete with pictures of everything they have. We ordered and sat down in the food court waiting for it to be ready and soon enough she actually delivered it to us. Very impressive for a food court. But then she even came back 5 minutes later to ask how everything was! I've very rarely gotten checked on when I'm at a real Japanese restaurant, nevermind in a food court. 

Food was delicious and very unique. I'd definitely go back here again, especially considering the very affordable prices for the quality of food and service. 

It is SO refreshing to see a place that understands the value of good customer service and word of mouth advertising in making your business successful even if you are in the worst location imaginable."}
{"text":"pros:
1) cheap. 8.75 for Katsu curry. That's like $7.50 USD. Which is insane
2) sensible portion. It's a nice sized filet of meat, a good amount of curry, perfect amount of rice
3) flavor. Japanese curry is a little different from the traditional curries of curry-producing nations, like India, Thailand, Indonesia, etc. Curry served with Katsu is even a little more different. in asia lots of establishments, particularly in Korea, serve their katsu with a brown gravy that is flavored with demi glace, worcestershire sauce, and some type of a buttery roux. This curry definitely reminded me of that, and it still had a good hint of the traditional Japanese curry taste. Mine was served PIPING hot like it was fresh off the stove, made just now.
4) texture. Perfectly cooked, juicy meat, crispy breading, really nice, silky curry and good rice. Completements each other.

Cons:
1) the bland, mystery cabbage salad. It wasn't bad, but cabbage should be shredded much more thinly, and the salad needed more salt, more sugar, more vinegar.
2) no soup :(

I'll round this up from a 4.75 stars. Insane to find food of this quality at a shitty food court, nonetheless at a stall run by chinese folks. Nothing against the chinese, but typically walking into a chinese-run japanese food establishment is not something you do with high expectations."}
{"text":"Kaiju means Monster in Japanese....and this little gem is like Godzilla attacking you taste buds ....all others don't stand a chance. The monster combo is like a 1-2 uppercut to mothra's lower duodenum.....and he LOvES it! And to finish it off the Tofu Cheescake is like the lightning dragon breath , laying waste to the delight zones of your frontal cortex . Stop what you are doing now and run as fast as you can to KAIJU! Xoxo"}
{"text":"I've been to Kaiju 4 times since I discovered this place 6 months ago through Yelp, and I'm convinced that on the 7th day, God created Kaiju.

Finding Kaiju in the basement of The Shops at Aura was like finding a golden treasure chest in the depths of the ocean.  You'd never find this place on your own, but with the help of Yelp Tips (The treasure map), it was really easy to find.

So you approach the golden treasure chest, and it's beaming (with the smiles and friendliness of the owners).  You shake the treasure chest to try to figure out what's inside.  After about 5 minutes, the mystical mermaids (owners) determine that you are a worthy human and unlock the golden treasure chest and present to you the Golden Chicken Katsu with Curry and Coleslaw (I've documented this sacred treasure in the picture below).

In all seriousness though, after you order your food, you find a seat in the food court, and when it's ready the owners personally deliver the food to you - thus, service is top-notch.  The food is amazing as well - the chicken katsu is hot/freshly made, placed atop a mound of white rice, and surrounded by a moat of their heavenly curry.

If you're in the area, def. check this place out and thank me later."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick bite on a Friday night... Dinner for 2 was $23 but we had a lot of food! Curry sauce was great, as was the fried fish... Not greasy at all... Just such a weird mall... Read somewhere the tenants were taking the landlord to court.. Deff could see why... Anyway good food and a really nice proprietor!"}
{"text":"Kaiju is one of the underground gems of Toronto! Located in an abandoned looking food court under Bed Bath and Beyond's glass building located on Yonge Street, I'm surprised to know that people found out about this Food Court despite it being super hidden. There are a few Asian shops on this floor though it didn't seem extremely popular when I went over the break. 

For approximately $10, the portion size was rather small. We ordered the curry chicken katsu with rice. Half of the box was the chicken katsu portion cut into nice slices for you to eat. The rice took up 1/3rd of the space and the remainder of it was filled with a small salad. Even though it was a food court, they brought the food to our table - something I haven't seen food courts ever do!

What I really appreciated about this dish was the curry. It was really authentic Japanese styled curry - something you don't really have at other places! I think I might come back if I were in the area!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Japanese style curry, so yesterday D and I, including one of our friends decided to grab a quick dinner here. I have to say, the food is just as good as the other times that we have been here. D and I ordered the Monster Combo ($19.50 before taxes) that serves two people. The owners of this place is always friendly. This is definitely my go to place for quick Japanese curry."}
{"text":"After reading reviews, I wanted to see what the hype was all about and I can say I was not disappointed. 

Located in the basement food court of the Aura condo. Strange location to find such great food but it was worth the mysterious trek. Greeted by an middle-aged gentleman who was very pleasant and conversational.

Ordered the chicken katsu with rice for take out. The chicken was fried on the spot. The chicken was very tender and juicy with a perfectly crispy outer layer. I ate the chicken first alone, then dipped it in the curry, then later drenching it in the curry. The curry drenched chicken was well balanced with the rice and creamy coleslaw. It was the perfect portion for $8! 

Am extremely satisfied with food and the excellent service. Will definitely come by with friends for take out between classes :)"}
{"text":"Must try, worth the effort to go to Toronto just for this. It is located underground FYI.  Their curry is phenomenal, and we had their fried udon with sambal, and Malaysian char kuih teow as well, and they were amazing! Will come back for more soon."}
{"text":"A little hidden gem inside the basement food court of the Aura condo building complex that contains the Marshall's and Hard Candy Fitness gym.  I didn't even realize there was a food court in this building had it not been for my YEA that recommended it.

The staff are so nice and even brought out food out to the table in the court once it was ready.  Something extremely atypical of a fast food place but the food court was literally a ghost-town.

The Japanese style curry was thick, warm, and hearty.  It was a deep brown colour and also had a nice sweetness to it as well.  It really went well with the pork cutlet and chicken karaage combos that we ordered.

I especially enjoyed the fresh karaage which where skewered for easy consumption and the rice was able to soak up all that curry that was ladled into the dish.

I highly recommend you take a visit into this little tucked away treasure."}
{"text":"The location is in the food court below aura. The food tastes pretty good. The owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"I came back again the other day to get the Eggplant and Minced Meat, it is so good and the portion is huge even for two meals. The owner also was super nice and gave us discount loyal cards (Buy 9 Get 1 Free). Definitely not your usual food court stand, I will be heading back there today too. 

If you live near College Park, this is definitely a good day to day eatery for us students."}
{"text":"People say this place is hard to find as if that is a bad thing... In Toronto a place like this out in the wild would have a line all the way from Bang Bang my ice cream to Uncle What's his face. See it as a scavenger hunt, and the reward being tasty, crispy, flavourful, satisfying, unpretentious bowl of greatness. I love restaurants like this, because it is rid of any pretentiousness, I mean if you can survive in a food court that is surrounded by fallen hopes and dreams and perhaps a few life savings, then you know it is the real deal. There are lots of hype in the T.O food scene, but if you want to escape all of that, and cheer yourself up, this is the place to go. If I was famous, this is where I'd go for food when I've had enough Michelin stars and mountains of blow, this place triggers the same area of the brain that gives you the level of satisfaction as blow for like 1/10 of the price and you won't be judged if you finished it in 5min and asks for seconds."}
{"text":"I accidentally stumbled upon this gem during the Pride Parade in 2014. It was a REALLY hot day and my friend and I wandered down here to take a break from watching the parade in the heat and grab something cold to drink. We chose to purchase a drink from Kaiju because the staff were just so friendly. They let us sample the curry and it was delish but we weren't hungry at the time and lets face it, the last thing I wanted to eat on a swelteringly hot day was curry.

Fast forward to a few hours later when we are hungry (and still really hot), but my friend had that yummy curry on her mind so we trekked back there and had our first Kaiju meal! It was so good.

I've been there multiple times since then and still love their curry. I've tried a couple of other things, but would say the curry is the star for sure. I always get it with the grilled fish, but their katsus are very good too. 5/5.

Mama's chicken. 4/5. Also very good. The chicken stays crispy for a very long time. I took it back home to eat (a 20 min journey) and it was still so crispy!

Poutine. 3/5. Would pass on this. I think I'm biased and love my poutine with cheese curds which they do not use here.

Tofu cheesecake. 3/5. It was good to try and surprisingly refreshing but I don't think I would get it again.

Service. 5/5. The people working here are so sweet and treat you like a friend every time. They even bring the food to you at your seat.

Ambience. 2/5. It's in a food court, and a pretty depressing one at that. Almost no foot traffic. I feel bad for the other vendors (of which there are only 2-3 of in the entire food court).

Definitely check this place out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This place has 267 reviews already, so I don't think I need to say much that hasn't been said, but here's the basic run down of what to expect:

The flagship item is their Pork or Chicken Katsu (basically a cutlet of breaded meat) accompanied with white rice, coleslaw (aka \"salad\"), and a ladle of Japanese Curry, all packaged within a styrofoam container for your dining in or taking out needs.
And it is indeed, pretty darn tasty curry. 
And it is located in a pretty damn depressing underground food court.
And you will spend a meager $9.61 after tax for this meal (without a drink).
And you will likely also give is a 4 or 5 star review, just as the hundreds of other Yelpers.

Prove me wrong. I dare you."}
{"text":"I've bookmarked this place for awhile and always wanted to try and very glad I did.  The food was relatively good and an enjoyable experience throughout.  I would definitely return to try another dish next time.

Food: 4/5, we got the big curry combo (pork, fish and shrimp cutlets with curry and rice with Malaysian sambal noodles). Very tasty but I wish there was a bit more curry or sauce for the cutlets. The noodle could've been a bit more spicy too.

Service: 4/5, it's a food court but the owner brought the food to our table and asked us how it was near the end of the meal.  He was all smiles and it was an unexpected service from a food court place.  

Ambience: 3/5, not the best location underground in the aura condo shopping area but it was still brightly lit at the food court and seating wasn't too bad.

Price: 3/5, it came to about $17 per person with combo being $19 and $9 for noodles.  It's not super cheap but good."}
{"text":"Definitely made a customer!

I only have 2 gripes with this restaurant.  Firstly, it's really hard to find (the second I'll mention later)!  For those relying on a gps, it seems a little weird that a Scadabush would have a small Japanese restaurant located right in the middle of it.  It wasn't until after I walked from one end of the building to the other did I discover the little entrance to the 'Shops @ Aura', a little floor with some shops similar to what you would expect to find at Pacific Mall. 

As I arrived, I met a nice middle aged-man who appeared to be the owner of the shop (was the only one there at the time).  He came up to me and we struck a nice little conversation.  He told me a little about himself, the types of food they offered, and asked me a little bit about myself.  Overall he was a very nice man who was very much concerned with making sure you had a pleasant experience.  

Me and my friend (after he arrived) decided to both get the Pork cutlet dish, which was-for $10- a really good portion.  The dish came with coleslaw, steamed rice, pork cutlet, and their famous Japanese curry.

I've never been a big fan of traditional curry, but the minute I tried my meal, I fell in love.  This type of curry was nothing like traditional curry.  It had the elements/smells that you would expect, but with a sweeter/non spicy sauce.  The coleslaw mixed in with the curry was also surprisingly a delicious treat, although I doubt that was an intended mix.  Finally, the cutlet was like no other place I've been to previously.  Unlike pretty much every other Japanese restaurant that pounds the meat until it's about 1mm in thickness, Kaiju left their meat with a good amount of thickness, which allowed it to stay moist.  Mixing it with the curry sauce extremely delicious, and with the plain rice to stir around to absorb the sauce made a perfect spoonful.  

My second gripe, was that there wasn't enough sauce at the end of my dish! Now I admit it may have been because of a few spoons I ate without rice, effectively throwing off the ratios, or it may have been because some got into the coleslaw(no regrets), but my last few spoons were having me scrape the rice against the remnants of the sauce, hoping for one last hit before the pleasure was all gone.

After the meal, the owner came out and asked us how it was.  Hopefully our sighs of satisfaction clued him in on such a question.   He invited us back to the counter and offered us a sample of some jam that he provides for breakfast (given he knew I worked close by, he suggested I come down to try it), and it was very delicious! It was a creamy sweet, which almost reminded me between condensed milk and caramel.  It made me definitely consider the 15-one way walk to come for some breakfast.  Ultimately I don't think I'll have the time to go for the breakfast, but I'll definitely be back to get some more of his food.

Overall I must say the experience was superb.  Fantastic service, quiet atmosphere (may have been due to weird time to eat), and delicious food, really put things over the stop.  I only wish the best for the owner of this shop, and continued success! 

Everyone needs to find their way through the labyrinth of a mall to find the hidden treasure at the end!"}
{"text":"I wasn't a big fan of tonkatsu until I tried theirs here and now I'm addicted! For a little under $10, you get a giant slab of super juicy pork or chicken, a generous serving of very flavourful curry, rice and coleslaw. Everything in the meal went well together, nothing seemed out of place and after a full plate, you were left wanting for more because it was so so tasty. 

Im waiting for the day they move out of the food court into a nicer little place of their own so I can take all my friends to dine here. They also sell homemade kaya."}
{"text":"This food was delicious and the workers were extremely friendly while I waited. A bit hard to find but well worth the search"}
{"text":"Came here with my coworker, she got the chicken katsu curry and I got the pork katsu curry. I thought the portions were on the smaller side compared to other places but it was perfect! The curry tastes authentic and I was pleasantly surprised that the katsus were fried to perfection. The chopped texture of the coleslaw was not uniform which led me to think that they make it themselves which was huge plus for me. It makes eating it more enjoyable. I'd come back here again if I'm craving katsu curry :) I recommend the chicken over pork as it was more juicier!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I found out this place just a week before they close shop inside a dead mall, aka Shops at Aura. I am glad I was able to visit a few days before they close this location with some foodblogger friends!

I ordered the Curry Chicken Katsu Rice as per the staff's recommendation along with their kaarage and they both were super delicious!  The Chicken Katsu was breaded evenly and fried to perfection! The meat was still very tender and juicy! The Kaarage was even better, I was shocked how tender and flavourful the meat was, it wasn't rough at all like your typical chicken skewer.  The best is the curry, it was thick and flavourful and not spicy at all.  It smelled so nice and tasted amazing, pair it with your chicken and rice, I can eat a few of these in one meal.

I enjoyed my meal so much I bought a Fish Fillet Katsu home for my parents to try and they both loved it and was impressed with the fish and curry.

Kaiju! Please find a new location and reopen soon! The closer to the path, the better!!"}
{"text":"Kaiju is an excellent japanese katsu (Cutlet) / curry place tucked away in an underground food court where half the spots are vacant due to lack of foot traffic.  The first time i tried to visit this place, i had a hell of time trying to find this place. Soon i realized that that was common occurrence among first time visitors.  When you find it yourself, you will know exactly what i mean.  

So far, i've been to Kaiju just about 6-7 times and one thing for sure is that their execution is extremely consistent.  Their deep fried foods are so NOT greasy it's quite amazing and upon finishing the meal, you never get that uneasy, unsettling feeling after eating a KFC meal.  They have variety of options such as Fish, Pork, chicken, shrimp, and paired with their signature japanese curry, it's quite the deadly combo (in a good way).  

I've brought many pple to this place and I'm gonna continue to do so as long as they serve up the same calibre of goodness that they have always been. 

I LOVE Kaiju and so should you!"}
{"text":"Totally randomly stumbled upon this place while roaming the new aura plaza.  I'm a huge japanese curry fan and I gotta say, this ranks up there in yumminess.  I've tried lots of Japanese curry even all the way in japan so I know a thing or two.  I tried the poutine cause I wasn't actually hungry but my eyes got the better of me. YUMMY.  Fries are thick and crispy and the curry... OMG...  Sweet, slightly spicy, and savory. I am definitely coming back for the full fare."}
{"text":"Hidden underneath the Aura shops so it may be a bit hard to find but definitely worth it. We ordered the Monster combo that comes with 4 pieces of deep fried shrimp, pork katsu and deep fried fish. It comes with 2 large containers each with rice, delicious fresh coleslaw and a generous serving of Japanese curry - all for only $18! We thought it was a great deal.. It's the best pork katsu we've had, and the curry is delicious. The fish was alright.. hoping next time we could maybe substitute for the chicken as we've heard good things about it :) the service is friendly here and offered some samples for us to try before we ordered. We'll definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"It's located at the basement level of the building. The curry is good! But the portion of the rice is little. When you order a curry, it comes with rice and salad."}
{"text":"The Pork Curry Katsu is not that better than what I've tasted in China whereas the Tofu Cheesecake really is a decent dessert with very soft mouthfeel."}
{"text":"I adore this place! I love their hospitality and their server(s) are so nice! This is why in my opinion they do better than the rest of the stores below the atrium. 

You have to get the curry! Its such a comforting dish to have if your into it! 

I will definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and am never disappointed. Often the service is almost too friendly, but in this world, a few extra pleasantries is always nice.

Fried Chicken, Pork and yes, the Fish Filet is all delicious. Can't go wrong with any of the three. The curry itself I could use just slightly more of, but it's still delicious!

Don't be afraid when you go down escalators, just find the food court and enjoy. Don't mind the empty spaces. \"They are working on it\" the realtors, developers and management would say. Go up to the front, order, pay then go find a seat. The food will come to you.

I'd come back any time for more curry!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Japanese curry/chicken katsu I've had in Toronto.
Definitely try the Curry Poutine too!

Wonderful service on top of it all."}
{"text":"Just a fantastic restaurant and amazing owner. Came here almost every other day on my business trip to Toronto. Very unique and authentic Japanese curry served with a wide variety of meats. This restaurant is tucked away downstairs in a shopping center and is the definition of a hidden jewel. Restaurant also sells a delicious, homemade coconut jam. 10/10 will return every time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"Large portions and good flavors at a cozy fast food court location. My friend and I tried their meal for 2 and it was very filling. Definitely worth considering for Japanese curry takeout."}
{"text":"This place was epicly HARD to find. FYI, it's in the AURA underground and you need to go downstairs. The mall is...well, it looks like an underground Pacific Mall from kennedy/steeles, but devoid of actual shops. All the main dishes are sub $10. It's more of a japanese home style food and the owners are VERY nice.  I would recommend the curry and they fry their chicken/fish nicely. The exterior is nice, crisy, and fairly light.

This is in the FOOD COURT AREA. I always go sometime in late afternoon, so the entire area is empty."}
{"text":"Funny I've walked by this building a thousand times, I didn't know it had the food court/mini mall in the basement.  It is an ABSOLUTE DISMAL section (Marshalls/Bed Bath/failed Madonna gym upstairs).  At least 1/2 the shop/stalls are vacant, it feels depressing.  More importantly I liked the chicken katsu (spelling?), it's on the smaller side, at almost 10 bucks it's a small portion, price should be 'lower' of serving larger (extra chicken).  The owner came up to me and asked me to tell my friends to come visit (business maybe not booming...)."}
{"text":"Got the pork katsu and yum! The curry is indeed as good as the others say! Thick and savory, but not spicy, and would love to have a little more sauce. The cutlet itself was good as well, crisp and not oily. The order came with a portion of coleslaw. I prefer my coleslaw with vinaigrette, but if you like it with mayo you might like it more than I did. The cashier was incredibly nice as well."}
{"text":"Home made and so flavourful! The chicken is all white meat. I got hot and it was just the right amount of heat. The w working here was so welcoming and friendly. I can't say enough positive things about this restaurant. It's below the marshalls, take the escalator down. Worth the stop for sure!"}
{"text":"This place deserves all the rave reviews it gets, and my friends love this place, and I do too, but not really for their curry but for their service. I have my own favourite spot for curry, but the food here is nevertheless decent and won't disappoint.

I hate the location of this place. It's situated in the basement of Aura which barely gets any foot traffic and makes the entire place just seem downright depressing. I feel awful for the business owners who likely invested a lot of money into these properties and are now stuck with it. I know this is not Kaiju's fault but I do sympathize with these people, but it's more the reason for me to come to hopefully bring some life into this plaza. Maybe a Chatime or something can open up to attract more customers.

Anyway, the guy who always works here (at least the times I've been) is super friendly and is really caring. It's a food court and yet the man brings the food to you even though he's not even expected to!! He's always making conversation with his regular customers and I really appreciate that (even though I don't get to come here often enough). I am a big fan of people who value good service.

The prices are good - for under $10 you can get a breaded Katsu curry that should be large enough for lunch, or a light dinner. For me, the curry has an odd hint of a sweet fruity taste, which sort of puts me off a bit. Not inedible by any means, but that slight hint of taste doesn't match my palette. With that said though, the Katsu here is excellent, probably the best I've had in the GTA. It is not overly oily yet crisp and juicy - I would rather come here for their chicken Katsu over Hot Star down the street.

The food court is usually dead for a food court but I do see that most people are ordering from Kaiju - it's scary to think how empty the place would be if they didn't exist. I hope that businesses in the Aura basement will eventually thrive with more people and businesses moving to the downtown core. It would be a travesty for Kaiju to close - keep supporting them!"}
{"text":"I don't know what that curry is made out of, but it's liquid gold. The fried cutlets are  crispy and hot, and the woman that manages the place is really friendly. If they were closer to the financial district, i'd probably be there every week."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out because of its great reviews (and close proximity to my work) and I'm so glad I did! Completely agree with all the great reviews. I got the fried fish fillet japanese curry and it was amazing. Good portion size for the price (it was $8.95 I believe) and good fish to rice ratio. This place is kind of hidden (downstairs in shops at aura) and the foodcourt where it's located wasn't busy at all. One of the staff members even came to my table to ask how everything was which was super nice considering it's a fast food area. Definitely coming back to try the fried shrimp curry as well. Highly recommend if you're looking for some great japanese curry!!"}
{"text":"Effort to locate it definitely worth! The fish is a must: crispy outside juicy inside! Chicken is good too, never too dry! The curry is nice! Ask for the spicy level. The place is new and clean, peace and friendly!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in here Saturday for lunch based on Yelp reviews, and this place deserves every bit of the high rating!

I love Japanese curry rice and I have been to many curry places in the US as well as over in Japan (and I do like to make it from time to time, but out of a box...), and I have to say this place definitely tops the list. Not only are the owners super friendly and gave us samples to try before we decided to order, the curry itself is all made from scratch and is wonderfully savory with just the right thickness. We ordered the pork katsu curry and the eggplant cheese curry, and both were amazing. The pork katsu was just the right thickness and it wasn't oily at all! The eggplant cheese curry was an interesting take and I gotta say the cheesiness compliments the homemade curry sauce well. If there is one thing they can improve on, it is to give a bit more sauce as I was running out of sauce towards the end of my meal. Other than that, if you love Japanese curry, definitely give this place a go.. you won't be disappointed. It is located in a half-empty food court, but not too hard to find :)"}
{"text":"For a food court establishment this place is great.

Their curry is delicious and the service is great! The guy taking your order tells you to have a seat and they bring the food to you! This is better service than 90% of the sit down Chinese restaurants you go to."}
{"text":"Everyone has already covered the food pretty well. 2 complaints....the mall
Is depressing, other then Down Under Bedding in College Park. Also, the plastic cutlery they provide is garbage. Needs to be upgraded"}
{"text":"Just went back here last week and I guess I finally came to my senses a bit. Admittedly, I think I bought into the hype a little more than I should of the last round. Yes, the curry sauce is great; well rounded, full flavour, good complexity, smooth and easy on the palate but that's about where it ends. The portions are ridiculously small for the price considering this is food court food. Depressingly, there wasn't even enough curry to cover my rice and that's the star of the dish. I went with the lowly chicken cutlet and it was dry, dry. Crispy but tenderness wasn't part of this recipe. Veggies? Wait.. maybe is somehow was infused in the curry sauce because I couldn't find any hints of it anywhere. Some veggies would of really brought some much needed pop and freshness to the dish.

All in all, the only joint keeping this food court interesting is also a big disappointment. I'm going to give them 2 stars because I admire their perseverance (in a deserted food court) and a little pity goes a long way perhaps. No need to cry if you don't get around to this one."}
{"text":"Was really excited for this place, never really read the reviews just saw that it was well rated so I decided to try it out...

First of all this is not a purely Japanese curry place. They have a bunch of other asian dishes as well. Specifically Chinese (as it is Chinese owned).

Now for the total price which came to $9 something, I felt cheated.

The chicken has been brined, or bought pre frozen... So obviously quality sucked.
The slaw was bland, and nothing special, just there to fill the styrofoam box.
The curry was surprisingly quite nice, but what really disappointed me was the shitty overcooked Chinese rice they used. What makes the Japanese curry dish really special is the rice. Real Japanese rice.


If you've been to Japan, or you are Japanese and you are craving Japanese curry, your better off making it yourself at home. Trust me.

The amount of positive reviews of this restaurant has me really doubting the integrity of all yelp reviews. I should have turned away when I saw the type of facility (the food court which is 85% empty ) was operating in."}
{"text":"Finding this place is not the easiest thing.  Wandering through partially vacated stores and hallways.  

This sad little food court really only has one thing going for it, and that's Kaiju.  Ordering is dead simple, as the menu is fairly limited.  Decided to go with the Chicken Katsu.  Once I ordered, I was told to take a seat anywhere.  It wasn't overly busy that time of evening, so the guy who took my order actually walked my tray of food out to me.  Very nice of him to do that.

The katsu was good.  Good flavours, however it was a fairly small amount of food.  There was a fairly small scoop of rice and then the katsu.  

Overall, it was good food, but not something I'd seek out again.  Others claims its one of the better katsu places in Toronto, but having been to Japan and Hawaii, I've had much better."}
{"text":"Recently, I went to Kaiju with my bf and we decided to try their Monster Combo because why not? And guess what? It was so worth it. It's better than getting an individual meal. You get 3 mains (shrimp, fish fillet and chicken/pork katsu) for the price of two. 

My advice? If you're with someone and wanted to try more than a type of meal, get the Monster Combo - it was delicious and filling.

PS: The owner told me he wanted to expand his business and is looking for a better location. So good luck to him and his team and hopefully they'll find a non-hidden place. I mean they do work hard and are very humble. That's what I like about Kaiju :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Kaiju (which means \"strange beast\" in Japanese) on two occasions and I've enjoyed their dishes during both those times.
The owner is Malaysian and the menu selection is a mingling of select Malaysian and Chinese quick-dish favorites and familiar Japanese dishes. The owner and his crew provide warm and friendly service, and customers who are new to Kaiju are provided with some helpful insights about their own take on alot of the dishes, ensuring that hungry customers have their meals in good spirits. The kiosk also features a coconut and egg based spread called Kaya which is well-known in Malaysia.
The first time for me was with a small group of friends and we shared a few dishes. Everyone commented about loving the Mama's Chicken and I also remember the addictive taste of the house-made curry sauce which wasn't very powering. It was great when served as a poutine, doesn't always have to be strictly poutine sauce, right? :-) 
The second time was also just as good as the first, and a friend and I got the same friendly vibe. I think this time I had a one of the Katsu dishes.
I think almost every dish at Kaiju would have me returning whenever I could, but it is that unique curry sauce that gets me craving for their dishes."}
{"text":"Curry is so nice and the chicken is crispy like my 3 pointers when I ball in my PG1s."}
{"text":"Tried Kaiju on a Friday afternoon after a friend mentioned to me that it's a popular curry place.  I went at around 2:30pm and noticed that the food court (actually, all of The Shops at Aura) was pretty abandoned.  I was greeted instantly by the owner who asked me what I wanted and I ended up getting the Pork Katsu curry.  I was told to just wait at a table -- knowing that it was a food court, I decided to sit at a table near the stand and was really surprised when one of the ladies working there brought out my food for me.

The curry itself didn't seem that amazing to me -- pretty standard curry sauce that was a bit thicker than other places (suppose it's the roux in Japanese curry?).  The pork cutlet, however, was just right -- lightly battered and still hot.  The meal came with rice and salad (mostly cabbage).

Overall, the food was good (not as amazing as I read about) and the service was unexpected and great.  I would stop here again if I'm in the area and want comfort food."}
{"text":"Awesome service with awesome food tucked away in a food court downstairs of the Aura building! I wish there was a little more curry, as I ran out before I finished my rice and katsu."}
{"text":"Was looking for lunch in the area and happened upon this gem of a food court restaurant through Yelp. 204 reviews and 4.5 stars?? Must be something special - it was, especially considering its location in what is probably the most depressing, deserted mall downtown.

We got the chicken katsu, Kaiju poutine, and a slice of their Japanese tofu cheesecake (only available on Saturdays). My boyfriend really enjoyed the katsu and I can confirm the curry was delicious - well-seasoned and savoury with a wonderful touch of sweetness. The thick-cut fries in the poutine were also cooked to perfection - light and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I didn't love the cheesecake as the flavour was a little too light for me, but it was my first time trying tofu cheesecake so maybe it's an acquired taste.

The only downside is that prices are a little bit high for portion sizes and the fact that it's still fast food, albeit really good fast food."}
{"text":"Don't let the deserted location of this place drive you away. The food is absolutely delicious and fresh! It's funny how this place is in the basement of one of the most dead food courts in Toronto. The manager is such a nice guy and he will actually bring the food to you so you don't have to stand and wait for it. I got the pork katsu combo which was cooked to perfection and affordable at $8.50. I did notice however that the rice tasted a bit burnt and not fresh. I also wish they had the monster combo available for one person! I really wanted to try a bit of all the meats."}
{"text":"Great price and tasted unique. Tried the fish filet with curry. It was filling. Honestly go get some now. Seems like they add new menu items every now and then, last I visited they had fried chicken with curry."}
{"text":"It's japanese fast food, like McDonald's but with the \"Asian\" twist.  Finding this place is a challenge, as other reviewers have noted.  Look for the Bed, Bath, and Beyond, Marshalls, and Hard Candy fitness entrance.  Go in and down the escalator.  There's a map at the first turn if you need to orient yourself.  Then go straight to the end and turn left into their food court aka \"The Eatery\".  The underground mall has space for 130 shops, but only about a dozen are open.  The food court itself is quiet with maybe only 4 or 5 stalls operational.  There are more empty stalls than occupied ones. 

Kaiju gets all the business surprisingly.  I don't get the impression that they have better food than the other stalls, but their marketing appears to be better.

The proprietors are chinese, if that means anything.  I heard them speaking Mando and Canto.  

It bugs me that they use cheaper medium grain jasmine rice rather than the plumper Calrose rice that I usually associate with japanese food including curry.  The curry is from a package, probably a cheap chinese knockoff of Glico.  The MSG aftertaste is quite strong.  The chicken katsu is fried well.  However, the chicken meat itself has no flavor.  It wasn't marinated, I don't think.  However, this is ok because the curry has sufficient seasoning.  The cole slaw is ok, nothing spectacular.

I'm trying to like this, but I don't really.  It's overhyped.  I guess for $8, it's a good enough deal.  Service was fast.  I got my food within 5 minutes of ordering.  I just wish the food was more authentically japanese.  After the debacle that was japango, I should have learned to keep my expectations low for japanese cuisine in this city."}
{"text":"I feel like my experience was overhyped. I was told by my gf's that this place was bomb diggity - but I thought i was just average. Firstly, it's a bit hard to find - we got lost and ended up at the college park food court by accident. Came here at 1130am on a Tues - not busy at all. They have menu on the signs and they have pictures in their menu book - always  a plus when you can see what youre getting. Essentially - its all the same base - the only difference is your choice of protein. All portions comes with coleslaw, rice, the japanese curry sauce and of course your chicken, or fish, or shrimp etc. I ordered the chicken katsu to play it safe as my first time. Great service for a fast food stand. They brought our food to our table and even came back to ask if everything was good and if there was anything else they could get us. Our waiter was very attentive. Everything came out fast and piping out. Chicken katsu had good crisp and was super moist. This is my first time having the japanese curry. I expected the sauce to be sweet but it was different than how I imagined it. It wasnt an amazing fusion of flavours I was expecting though, but still somewhat enjoyable. The coleslaw however was lacking flavour - tasted like watered down slaw. Portion was good - I actually didnt finish all of it. The meal itself was under $10 taxes in and they take cash and card."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner again on a Thursday night. Ordered the pork katsu combo.  Instead of the salad I told the guy to just give more rice.  The pork was a little bit dry.  The fish that I had before was way better.  That being said it was a fulfilling meal."}
{"text":"Stopped by around 8 and the owner was nice enough to serve us. We ordered the fried shrimp curry on rice with salad on the side. Curry reminds us of the curry we had at a family run curryhouse in Tokyo. Leaves a nice aroma, slightly spicy taste in the mouth with a hint of sweetness. Unlike gyugyuya Japanese beef curry restaurant that has rice super drenched in super heavy curry that you wished you had less of, Kaiju' s curry leaves you wanting more. Even at 8pm, the fried shrimp was crispy and not oily. It was such a good deal for $8 before taxes in downtown Toronto. The only recommendation would be to serve Japanese short grain rice instead of Thailand rice. 

I guess the restaurant is an Asian inspired restaurant, serving you tasty Japanese curry, malaysian/Viet dishes. 

The owner makes his own Malaysian coconut egg jam, called Kaya.  Amazing. Picture Apple honey butter, but BETTER. you can call the owner a head of time and ask him to make a batch for you. Each tub costs $5. Cannot wait to spread it on my toast tomorrow morning!!!

A gem, too bad it is underground beneath the Aura condo, shops and above ground restaurants because you won't know it is there unless you look for it."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Had the combo and it was plenty for two people to share. The service was great too! Kaiju is one of the best spots in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place is hidden away in a food court under the Aura condo. Been here several times for the chicken katsu with curry (total $9.xx) and it's always consistent and a nice rich curry. I've made Japanese curry before from the Giro packs at the supermarket, which are decent, but this definitely had another dimension and body to it. 

It comes with a little salad/coleslaw that actually contrasts the curry nicely. 

Highly recommend and its cheaper and tastes better than Guyayaya on Dundas."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time at Kaiju and I hope it will be the best as well. This was my largest order yet, with one side dish (Thai spicy chicken) and one main (sambal fried udon). Also I would like to say I am not getting paid by the owners of kaiju to write reviews nor negotiating with them in any sort of way. It's just that the food is so bomb that I keep coming back and want more people to know about it. 

Today I was greeted by a lady at the cash register instead of the usual person. Not that there is any difference. I also got a stamp card from them last time where I would get one free meal with the purchase of 9 regular meals. Sweet deal in my opinion. 

The food was great as always. I opted out of the bean sprouts for the sambal fried udon this time and went for the cabbage instead just for personal preferences. However, that's ultimately up to you. The chicken looks burnt in the picture but trust me, those are all flavour crystals!"}
{"text":"Came here around 4ish. Finding it was like a needle in a haystack. So enter through the Bath & Beyond entrance and go down the escalator then follow the signs to the food court, once there turn right and arrive at Kaiju. The two workers working the cashier were very welcoming and friendly, also they gave me their recommendations for my next visit which was great and they also included a takeout menu which is also an added bonus.

So for my first visit, I got the highly recommended pork katsu curry. Which came to a total of $9.10 but with a pop $10.40, again not so bad because it was worth it. As I stood waiting, I watched them hand-breaded the ultra thin slab of pork meat then gently drop it into the deep fryer, I'm happy! That cutlet has to be crispy and fresh! So with this, there is rice and a salad included. Moving onto the curry, omg! It was amazing, it was sweet but it had enough kick then if you take the spoon they provide and just drizzle that over the freshly deep fried cutlet...mmmmm!!!! Delicious! 

I will be coming soon to try their other dishes and will leave another review."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious - the best way to describe Kaiju!

The chicken katsu was crispy and deep fried to perfection.  It didn't taste old nor was it too oily (a problem many places have).  The curry itself was the right blend of sweet and melow with a smooth finish, true Japanese style curry.  

The dish came with a portion of coleslaw and rice which were also very tasty.  The service was great, and I would definately come back again!"}
{"text":"Kaiju is located in the Shops at Aura plaza near where I go to school. I first heard about it on Yelp, and at that time, I have never had Japanese curry before. Well, I'm glad I did try it out! It's one of my favourite take out places to date! The people who run it are quite nice and I chat with them a bit every time I go. They are known for their Chicken Katsu and other things, but a must-try is their new Tori Karaage. It has very tender meat and the right amount of crispiness too. Thanks Kaiju for being there when I need a great hot meal. :)"}
{"text":"Have been meaning to try this place for a while now and finally had the opportunity tonight. 

This place is in the lower floor of the Aura building. Unfortunately, the 'mall' flopped and so it looks deserted. 

The restaurant may be hard to find for some but once you go downstairs, follow the food court signs. 

There are only about 3 restaurants that actually operate. This restaurant probably being the busiest. 

Was greeted very politely by the operator. I explained that it was my first time so he explained the different dishes. 

It's basically you choice of Katsu accompanied with Japanese curry, rice and coleslaw. He explained that the curry is not like Indian or Thai curry which is usually spicy. He said that it has some sweetness to it and he was absolutely correct. 

We ordered the grilled and fried fish. The fried fish was lightly breaded and deep fried to perfection. The grilled fish was perfectly cooked, moist and tasty. It is a little salty but the rice and coleslaw balanced it out. 

He came to check on us to see if we liked it. 

I see this place moving to a street level location in the near future. Great food at reasonable prices with great friendly service."}
{"text":"Alright, I love Japanese curry ever since I was a broke student in Japan.  It is cheap, filling, delicious and ubiquitous.  Unfortunately, despite most North American cities having realized that Japanese food is more than sushi -- it still doesn't realize it's more than sushi and ramen.  Sure, there are good spots in LA and NYC, but most Japanese curry served (including J-curry specialty houses) comes from a Glico or S&B box.

So, I was surprised (to say the least) when I heard there was a Malay/J-curry stand in the underground food court beneath the Aura condo - literally down the street from my apartment.  First off, most of the other reviews look a bit suspect -- 5-star reviews from pretty new accounts (not hating - I would probably ask my friends to write a review or two if I was opening up shop).  In addition, the entire underground mall under Aura is pretty sad - it's a ghost town with more than half of units unoccupied and the shopkeepers can't help but loom as you might be the only potential customer to wander in.

So, I was pretty skeptical.,  But hey, cheap rent usually means restaurants willing to take chances - if it sucks, at least it would suck spectacularly and entertainingly so.  Also, they had a coupon on their Facebook page that allows you to buy two curry meals for $10 (regular price is ~$8 each - expired end of January) - so at least this was a cheap trial.

I ordered the pork katsu curry, which comes with coleslaw and a side of rice.  It's a decent size for the price and the rice and katsu were solid. The lady grabbed the eggplant with cheese version and really enjoyed hers.

The curry is rich and slightly thinner than most other places. Definitely not box-made and packed a lot of flavour.  I asked for it hot (one less than their hottest, 'Kaiju hot') and it had a strong spicy kick, they mean hot!  Probably one of the best curry sauce I've had this side of the Pacific Ocean.  I still give the edge to Go!Go! Curry in NYC - as the curry is similar, but Go!Go! has a ridiculous selection in toppings. If Kaiju bottled their curry, I would buy it.

I've gone twice already and I'll probably become a regular as the curry is pretty damned good and it's close to my place.  Really looking forward to trying the Malay hawker style dishes as well.  I'm going to hold off on giving it the full bird 5-stars til I have more visits under my belt and try out their other dishes.  But will update when I do...

But honestly, the place is named 'Kaiju'... a.k.a. Japanese rubber monsters like Godzilla.  For fuck sakes, they even *named* this place well."}
{"text":"Legit japanese curry. 

The Monster combo for 2 consists of:
1. Perfectly fried fish
2. Perfectly cooked pork
3. Good shrimp. Just not as good as 1 and 2.

I would recommend the Fish. It's unbelievable.

The owners are a friendly family from Malaysia. The son learnt from a japanese curry chef.

I love a good curry and this hits the spot. 

The only complaint is that they provide only 50% of the curry volume that I need. Yes, NEED.

BONUS: authentic homemade Kaya by the bottle.... good luck finding that anywhere else"}
{"text":"Easily the best Japanese curry in Toronto. Katsu is fried to perfect, crunchy, and hot. The curry  sauce is authentic and delicious. You can't go wrong with the chicken katsu curry. My personal favourite though is the fish katsu curry - crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. The restaurant owners are super nice, and it's always a pleasure to grab a bite at Kaiju."}
{"text":"The food is cook-to-order, so the food is always fresh. I am a big fan of their pork and chicken katsu -- crispy and rich in flavor."}
{"text":"Had the chicken katsu here and honestly, it's the best lunch I've ever had in this area. At first I was hesitant about the curry because I'm not too crazy about it but once I tasted Kaiju's, oh man, it was so delicious. Also, the owner and the sister are the kindest and warmest people ever. 
I highly recommend this hidden gem to anyone."}
{"text":"we bought their kaya jam ( coconut jam) last month and really love the taste of it with our toasted bread! i like the fish curry but the curry itself isn't the typical japanese curry like we think before. the place wasn't really difficult to find as we thought before. it's inside the foodcourt of aura condo building which is front of ryerson building."}
{"text":"Amazing Japanese katsu. A little maze to get down but follow the food court signs. Definitely worth a visit. I tried the fried ckicen katsu and it blew my mind. Japanese curry was tasty. Friendly employees. Try it out!"}
{"text":"I am writing this thinking of going back. which is when I should probably write a review. I will update then... I like it a lot, the fish was amazing even I had just a bite, and I had the chicken katsu which was very enjoyable. it was not that hard to find like people say but it does take some searching for its a new food court. 
great food
great price
great amount ( just enough to be satisfied, maybe not full, but i am a big guy)
unexpected location"}
{"text":"3.5 for the food, 4.5 stars for the service. Overall, a pretty decent food court experience! As others have said, it's located in a basement food court (no windows, but pretty decent amount of seating), and you'll be greeted with: a) very friendly service, b) a good variety to the menu, and c) freshly made orders. 

First, location. We visited on a weekend and knew it would be a pseudo-mission to find this place. When you enter the building, head downstairs, walk straight till the very end of the hall, where you'll find a sign indicating \"Food Court\", pointing left. Head that direction and you'll find Kaiju in the food court you step into. 

Second, the food. We purchased one order of the Chicken Katsu Curry, which came with rice and coleslaw. We actually thought the curry was the tastiest thing in our takeout box. Sweet but still with a kick, and so delicious mixed in with your rice! We thought the chicken itself was kind of rubbery (it seemed overcooked) but the exterior was nice and crunchy. Overall, decent, but not the best chicken katsu we've had.

Third, the service. So sweet and friendly. The woman who served us would not stop smiling, and continually offered us water, drinks, cutlery, etc., to make our visit more comfortable. They care about their customers, and it shows.

Overall, above-average food court experience, and we'll be back again if we're in the area. For one order of Chicken Katsu Curry (with rice and coleslaw), we paid around $10.00. Drinks were around $2.00 each."}
{"text":"Excellent food selection and beyond excellent staff. When you flip your marker over to green, the servers are at your table so quickly. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"- chicken katsu: very comparable to Gyugyuya's katsu, The sauce was flavourful, and meat was crispy, not too dry or overly tender lol. It came with salad and rice. I cannot say which place is better because I have tried this so long before Gyugyuya opened, but for the price point I would definitely prefer Kaiju over Gyugyuya.
- Tofu cheesecake: only available on SATURDAY and it runs out pretty quick so make sure u be there early. The cheese texture was so fluffy, much lighter than Uncle tetsu's cheesecake, and it did have tofu taste in it. The cracker part in the bottom is a bit sweet which added extra flavour to the cake. Highly recommend this one ($4+tax/slice).
- Portion: pretty big compared to its price point
- Price: cheap 
- location: in the lower ground foodcourt of Aura's building (where has Marshall and BathandBeyond). not a good location but I don't mind the travel since they have good and cheap food."}
{"text":"My husband loves Japanese curry so every time we travel somewhere I try to find him some. This place was great, curry was a little sweeter than we are used to but still wonderful. Pork cutlet was cooked perfect and stayed crisp. Rice was a little dry but went well with the curry. little hard to find as it is in a food court on the bottom floor beneath a bed bath and beyond but worth looking for. The owners came out to check on us and were so nice."}
{"text":"I decided to come here because of the high rating on Yelp, but I did not expect to enter a deserted mall and a near-empty food court. The location is weird, but the food: wow. The curry was delicious and the pork was crispy. But, I found the portions to be very small. In your take-out box, the coleslaw took up a good chunk of space. The service was okay; not much to comment, so I'm not sure why the other reviews say that they bring the food to your table (they don't). I don't think I'll be making another trip to visit Kaiju, but it was alright to try once."}
{"text":"First time to try Japanese curry and I fell in love! Their chicken katsu is deep fried to perfection partnered with their amazing Japanese curry. Definitely the best Japanese curry in town!"}
{"text":"Haven't had Japanese curry since Japan a year ago, so it was a due time. My friend and I had the Monster Curry, with fried pork, fish and shrimp. It was pretty awesome, the curry was delicious (sweet and spicy) but the best part was the fried stuff. Lighr and crispy, it was katsu done right. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This is a little overdue, and much as I want to go on with my library of ridiculously excessive vocabulary of words to describe food places, I really don't see how a fast food joint can possibly deserve \"rave reviews\".  

In fact, I never really saw a point in checking in to a place that's got little to no cell reception, or even to a fast food joint that I'll just hop in and out of within minutes.  But not this time.

Kaiju is hidden in the food court under the new (at the time of writing, it's still considered new by Toronto standards) and also seems slightly unfinished (at the time of writing again) Aura, just at the corner of Yonge and Gerrard, in the basement under the lavish Red's, Duke's and Scaddabush.  As you can see, it's not exactly the same clientele you're expecting to face, and in this particular instance, trying to offer Japanese Curry as your signature dish to fight against the more posh offerings from the aforementioned restaurants is kind of like bringing a knife to a gunfight.  But this knife, is a highly deadly throwing knife.  

It doesn't offer classy seating, well furnished bathrooms or menus that sing to your inner hunger.  It's simple, Japanese curry, with various choices of what breaded meats, or fish, some rice, and a simple coleslaw.  Simple as that.  There's not much crazy, and there's no bling, and absolutely no frills at all.  It's simplicity and relative reasonable price point is what makes it attractive amongst all of its competitors in the food court.  This is what makes it a sure winner because it is a great option for anyone.  Yes, this is a food court option, and I made it sound like I've tasted a sliver of gold.  However, I challenge anyone to go in and give it a try.  I implore you to make a stop and see what's what.  Also worth trying is the poutine.  Substituting gravy for their curry is a nice twist.

This is what makes this place so special, because it's not anything too insane.  In fact, there is another Japanese curry joint (whose name shall not be named) using a cow for it's logo on Dundas, west of Bay street.  This place, has it beat.  Outclassed, and absolutely immaculate.  Every bit, worth it."}
{"text":"5 stars to me is definitely worth another visit.
 Im sure the rest of the yelpers did a good job describing the place. It is very nice and the curry isnt something I can compare with any other restaurant. It is pretty much liquid gold. Great quality and the katsu is made nicely on the spot.

The store owner is very friendly. I would def come more often if it was a bit cheaper (I mean its takeout afterall) or if they offered more curry per serving."}
{"text":"Best Japanese curry in Toronto. The sauce consistency was perfect and the flavour was gorgeous with a hint of sweetness. The katsu was nicely done with the panko crust light and crispy."}
{"text":"Sooooooo...

The food here was pretty good, service was atrocious. Too bad because this place had been on my list for a while. 

We arrived right at the beginning of a huge wave of people. We were easily identifiable as we were the only party with non-Asian people and who spoke to the owners in English (my obsessive hovering made me privy to this information). The person taking the orders spoke in very broken limited English, but we all managed. Then, when the line dissipated and the food still hadn't come, we decided to grab a table in the food court. 

About 15 minutes later, someone came out to give food to one of the tables, we indicated that it was ours, but so did another table (who had ordered after us, but had spoken to him in whatever language they were speaking), and they were served first. I went up to the owner and told him that we had ordered the same thing first, but he brushed me off and said our food was coming. This happened 2 more times and every time I went up to the owner and tried to inquire about our order. He rudely told me that it was coming, and provided no explanation as to why other people were getting the same food that we had ordered, even though they had ordered after us. He didn't even apologize for the selective service or the delay. I'd like to think that this was not a prejudice thing, as that would be disgusting on levels that I am not prepared to accept in Toronto, but this was extremely inappropriate. I will not be coming back, nor will I be recommending this place. 

The curry was very thin and a little too sweet, but the Katsu was fresh (albeit smaller than I expected)."}
{"text":"Was ok.    Came for the chicken curry based on others recommendations.  The owner was super friendly.    If I lived in TO not sure I would go out of my way to find this place."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Don't let the abnormally high reviews catch you suspicious, this place is for real. It's too bad that the location is terrible, since it's located in a food court of a mall that nobody knows or accesses aside from the regulars.

I was greeted with immediate jubilation from the husband-wife duo, and they immediately let me try some free samples, such as the curry. The curry tasted very good, and even though I'm not a rice person I can see why it's their specialty. They persuaded me to order the curry, but I had the Malaysian Fried Sambal Udon in mind and I stuck with it. Both of them were cool with it, and eventually the lady took my order and I proceed to take my seat.

The guy eventually brought the order to my table, which I thought was something he didn't need to do, but I certainly did appreciate it. The portions were very large, and honestly if I wasn't hungry there was no way I would've finished it. Either way, for food court quality the sambal udon was very good. It's a little spicy, but if you request less spicy beforehand the chef will lay it easy on the spice. The fish balls and chicken were very juicy and not very tough. This place uses the cheap udon, but given the price and location factor I wasn't neither too surprised or picky about it. For $8.50 it's definitely something I would eat again, though next time if I'm with friends I will certainly introduce this place's curry to them.

As for the employees, I eventually had a nice talk with the husband about how business is going (they've been in business for 2 years now), different types of Asian food, and if I had any friends or colleagues who would be interested in trying. I took a take out menu before I left, and for sure I will recommend this place to my friends, especially my Ryerson friends since the campus is across the street.

Hope this place survives though. Torontonians are really missing a gem."}
{"text":"Just ate the curry pork katsu for lunch, the pork chop was a decent size cut, wasn't too heavily battered and was very crispy. It went really well with the curry, which to be honest was nothing special, but nonetheless good. It was $8.50 which included coleslaw and rice. There's some other options such as chicken, fish and shrimp as well.

This place is literally a hidden gem, it's underneath the Aura which is largely a dead mall, it feels like those empty Chinese malls in the suburbs. I only heard about this place when I read some articles about the lawsuit where some of the unit owners are suing the developer."}
{"text":"Got the mamak mee goreng and it was soooo delicious!! The owner was so friendly and even let me try their curry and their tofu cheesecake (I immediately bought a slice after sampling). Will be back ASAP to try the Japanese curry!!"}
{"text":"Had been craving curry for a while, finally decided to try the place out. Flavourful curry and crispy chicken Katsu, pretty good for just under $10. The staffs were friendly, a lady even brought the food to me after I had sat down. Wished I had more!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand the 4.5 stars for Kaiju.

Thing is.. while everything I had was tasty, the flavouring didn't stand out to me. 

The much-hyped curry chicken katsu tasted average to me - it was very crispy and hot-off-the-fryer, but the actual curry sauce wasn't as mind blowingly good as Yelpers purported. I had the Mama Chicken as well, that was my second favourite dish after the Malaysian fried sambal udon.  That was definitely an above-average udon dish for a food court place, the sauce was great but overall, Kajiu was just okay.  

The cashier that helped us was an extremely nice man, though.  Came over to our table in the middle of our meal to ask if we liked everything, really sweet :) 

It's food court eats.  if you're looking for something quick and cheap in the area go for it.  I wouldn't really make it a mission again to go out of my way to come here though."}
{"text":"3 1/2 star rating 
(not sure how to increase my rating half a step!)

Finding Kaiju was a bit tricky - instead of going up towards Bed Bath and Beyond, you go down the escalator towards the \"Food Court\". Thankfully there are big signs pointing you to the right direction and after a bit of looking around, we found Kaiju amongst the mostly empty storefronts in the Food Court.
They are open Saturdays and found out that they sell cheesecake only Saturdays. I was excited to try their food and was happy to see that they have a \"picture menu\" so we could see what we are getting. The lady at the cash explained that they are known for their curry (which is different from the Indian curry) and that it wasn't as spicy but sweeter. They also have Malaysian food. But the main attraction for me (with my sweet tooth) are the cheesecakes. They are supposed to have the cotton cheesecake and tofu cheesecake. The lady at the front explained that there was no cotton cheesecake that day - only tofu cheesecake. The cotton cheesecake she explained was like Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake. I wondered why they didn't carry it since Uncle Tetsu's always have a huge lineup.
Anyways, we ordered the Chicken Katsudon and the Malaysian Char Keow/Leow Tiau (the picture menu spelled Keow and the brochure said Leow and I don't read Malaysian so...). The Chicken Katsudon came first - it was hot and fresh. The chicken was crunchy but tender on the inside. The coleslaw was creamy and also crispy - not soggy at all. The curry was good - I didn't find it spicy at all and it was sweet. The combination really worked well for me. On the downside, they put too much curry in my opinion, and I could have used more rice for my meal. 
Next came the Malaysian Char Keow/Leow Tiau. My husband's first reaction was \"where are the shrimps?\". The picture on the menu showed the shrimps prominently and my husband even dug through his food to find the hidden shrimps. No shrimps. He went back to ask for the shrimps and was told that there were no shrimps that day and that fish was used as a substitute. Well, there weren't any fish either - only chicken! Anyways, there was no point in arguing and the food tasted good anyway. It reminds me of one of the noodles we get from Salad King but my husband insisted that Salad King was better. I thought they were as good (the shrimps were still missing though!).
The \"owner\" (I assumed) came to us as we were about finished and gave us a sample of the tofu cake. In fairness he did ask what we think so far and we just politely said all was great and good. 
The tofu cake was really good! It was sweet and the texture isn't really like tofu - not as silky. I believe the base is a thin layer of brown sugar. I really enjoyed it and was convinced enough to buy a slice for 4 bucks and even inquire about the price of a whole tofu cake for purchase in the future. The \"owner\" did explain earlier that they discontinued selling the cotton cheesecake due to the fact that Uncle Tetsu is doing really well in that department and I guess they don't want to compete (?). He wants to focus on the tofu cheesecake instead. 
So we lined up (by this time they have about 3 pairs of people who came to specifically eat at Kaiju - actually all of the clients in the food court ordered from Kaiju!). But the lady who we talked to earlier (they did explain that this lady is new) is now saying they also don't have the tofu cheesecake for sale! Apparently, the tofu cheesecake are all reserved for the people who pre-ordered. The cost of the whole tofu cheesecake is 32 bucks plus tax. Pretty pricey but it's tofu cheesecake and we've never really had one before now. They told us to order at least 2 days ahead if we wanted the tofu cheesecake and they only have it Saturdays.
Overall it was a decent meal. Was I full? Not really. Does the food taste good? Yes. Will I go back for the tofu cheesecake? Definitely. And maybe even the Kaiju Poutine too"}
{"text":"Why did no one decide to bring me here until now? This place is a hidden gem and I quickly learned from the friendly lady at the cashier that Kaiju is one of the top restaurants in the GTA. Trust me, she wasn't lying. We ordered the classic chicken katsu curry with rice. What I like about the katsu is that it is fried perfectly crisp but doesn't feel oily. As well, the coleslaw is a nice touch to balance the flavour-filled dish. The cherry on top to the great food was that the service was amazing despite this being a food court. The lady at the cashier (assuming the owner) was super cute bringing the food over and checking up on us after the meal. As a side note, on Saturdays, they also offer tofu cheesecake which I will be back for next time!"}
{"text":"Delicious pork cutlet. Fried perfectly with a light and fluffy crust. Not oily or greasy at all. The cutlet is tender and tastes amazing. 

The curry is mild and does not burn like a usual Indian style curry. It's a nice blend of Japanese curry that is nuanced and complements the light crust of the cutlet. 

First time here and definitely found a new fav hole in the wall. Brian the owner is very nice and takes the time to chat and greets customers with a smile."}
{"text":"Great friendly and attentive service although it was dead since I was the only customer.

I spent $20 worth when I ordered the Fried Fish Fillet, Malaysian Fried Sambal Udon, and Mamak Mee Goreng.

The Fried Fish Fillet (Katsu style) was really tasty, but I think it was a bit overpriced, as the fish was a fair size, but then the flavourless salad was tiny and the rice was just alright.  It was great that the fish was not greasy so.  I don't normally eat in food courts, but when I do, regardless of whether it's good or bad food, you tend to get a lot of food.

It was a toss up between Malaysian Fried Sambal Udon and Mamak Mee Goreng because I've had Mee Goreng at different Malaysian restaurants many times before so Malaysian food is not new for me, but they suggested I order the Malaysian Fried Sambal Udon because it was homemade so I did.  It was BLAND with chicken and cut up frozen fish balls.  I had some Japanese Curry leftover from my fish so I poured it onto the noodles to enhance the taste.

I would only return for the Katsu stuff, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic food for an inexpensive price! A hidden Gem!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times & always felt that portions could be bigger. There is no doubt the curry taste is great but it's not enough to draw me to come back. 

Personally, I don't like the rice or the cabbage sides & always feel like there's not enough meat & curry. For a few $$s more I'd rather go to Salad King. 

Everyone raves about the personable service but it's just been quick serve for me every time I go, even when I do eat at the ghostly food court."}
{"text":"Epic epic Japanese curry at Kaiju. My personal favourite is the fried fish fillet. Each combo has a generous portion of meat or fish, rice and slaw. And of course the velvety, rich curry sauce. This is home style cooking at its best. I can't recommend this place more.

I haven't had the chance to try the other dishes, simply because the curry is irresistible. 

Unfortunately you won't be able to find this place by running into it by accident; its location under the Aura building in the food court is out of the way, and too quiet. But once you find the food court, you will have earned a delicious meal. The staff is so very friendly, too. Take a moment to have a chat with them."}
{"text":"Not sure what the fuss is all about. I ordered the Chicken Katsu; the sauce did not have much flavour. 3 stars for friendly staff and the counter lady bringing the food to me and checking to see if everything was okay. Looks like people finding the place, even though it is kind of in an obscure place.

Will need to try again another time and update my review."}
{"text":"Amazing food in a really random place! New York City has (had?) its best Banh Mi in a jewelry store. Montreal's best Thai food is in a student building food court. And now, with Kaiju, Toronto finally joins the ranks: our city's best Japanese-style curry is hidden in a dark, vacant mall underneath the horrific 60-storey Aura tower.


SERVICE & EXPERIENCE
Finding the mall entrance is a challenge. Finding the food court is a challenge. Finding Kaiju in the food court is... well, that part's easy because the only other options are two sushi places and about 10 \"FOR RENT\" and \"INQUIRIES CALL CHRISTINE LIN\" signs.

It's hard to find, but it's worth the effort: there is nothing like this place in Toronto.

The service is better than many sit-down restaurants in the city. The proprietors are always friendly, and more than willing to let you try samples. When you order, if you're eating in they'll let you sit down and then bring your meal to your table - and even set the napkins and plastic cutlery out! After you've started eating, they often come and check up on you to see if you like it, chat about the food, and bring you a customer loyalty card. It's some of the sweetest, nicest, most sincere and attentive service I've had in this city... BUT AT A FOOD COURT.


FOOD
As you've read here the food is incredible. I love Japanese curry, and I can safely say Kaiju's is the best in the city (my comparison points being Tokyo Kitchen, Tokyo Grill, Gyugyu Ya, Manpuku, Don Don (lunch), Bushi Udon Kappo, and some no-names). It's also among the best I've had in Japan as well (I ate a lot there...). It's not too sweet, it's a bit thinner than most (but still able to easily coat the katsu), and it's really original. It's not 'authentic', in the sense that I've not tasted any curry exactly like it in Japan, but it's really unique and it's DELICIOUS. Ask for extra sauce - it's worth the few bucks more.

The katsu is also incredible. Whether you order chicken, pork or fish, your meat will be dropped into the deep fryer the second you order it, and will come out hot and crispy. The meat is shockingly high quality for the price, and the quantity is the most generous of all the other choices in the city. It's really good value.

A word about the spice level: your choice only affects how much hot-pepper sauce they add to the curry (that's the reddish-orange substance you see in the pictures), not what kind of curry you get. MIX IT IN before you eat it, and don't go above hot or you'll drown out the natural curry flavour.

Finally, they also have a selection of Malaysian food. It's OK! But not as good as the curry. I had the Mama's chicken, which was quite good, but I like the curry a lot more. I also have no points of comparison for it, so I can't really give you a good rating.


CONCLUSION
So yeah, you really should try this place. Absolutely fantastic curry and incredibly sweet makes-you-feel-at-home service, all wrapped up in a weird, labyrinthine abandoned-mall ambience... I dunno, maybe I'm overthinking it but it's one of the most oddly compelling dining experiences I've had in this city."}
{"text":"This is a real gem hidden in the otherwise deserted Aura food court.  We got the chicken katsu and the fish katsu with japanese curry. Both were perfectly crunchy, fresh and the curry was very tasty!  The lady working there (possibly an owner) was extremely passionate about their food and was very friendly... A refreshing and pleasant experience that I was not expecting from a food court restaurant. I would definitely return to Kaiju again for a quick and satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"This was so good that I burned my tongue - I couldn't pace myself to resist the tastiness. I can't believe this is such a rare find in Toronto - it seems simple and like an obvious crowd pleaser. The owner brought our food to the table - how's that for food court service? I will definitely be back.

I wonder if this mall will become busier over time. It's brand new and I'm curious to know why more people aren't opening their businesses nearby with so much foot traffic in the area. The only other businesses in the food court were sushi places but everybody lined up for Kaiju! Personally, I like the abandoned food court setting because it's nice and quiet and clean. If this place is quiet at lunch I will be back many times - a quiet lunch spot is nearly impossible to find!"}
{"text":"As per other Yelpers' instructions, Kaiju was relatively easy to find. The lady on the till was very nice, and brought us our food and cutlery. Kaiju was one of the few places open for Boxing Day (a statutory holiday for many restaurants).

However, I was a bit disappointed with Kaiju because I had very high expectations before coming here. I visited this location with two other friends who ordered the chicken katsu curry and the karaage curry. I liked how the katsu and karaage were kept away from the curry sauce. I also liked how the curry sauce was a bit sweeter and made me appreciate the natural taste of Japanese curry. However, the food didn't really blow my taste buds away. I felt that the katsu was very ordinary, and my friend was actually somewhat disappointed because it seems like there was not a lot of karaage. He felt like we got more katsu compared to the amount of karaage he had. I felt that the rice was like any other rice you can cook at home as well. In fact, my friend actually said the rice tasted like Minute Rice (however, I didn't find anything wrong with my rice). The coleslaw tasted alright, and it made a good side dish. Overall, I felt like the dishes were something you can make at home, maybe through some experimentation. 

I would probably only come to Kaiju when I'm nearby or craving a quick curry dish. However, I would not trek all the way just to eat here again; I felt like Kaiju was very overhyped."}
{"text":"You know, I can't believe I'm actually reviewing food-court food lol... 

Kaiju is one of those unexpected hidden gem located in the food court area of the Aura condo, and most of their items range from $6 to $10 with a few exceptions. To get here, simply go down the escalator, turn left until you see a tea store then turn right, and you will see a food court with only 3 vendors.

Being a food court restaurant, I didn't expect good service or anything, but the owners are some of the friendliest people I have ever know. Everytime I went, they always took the time to explain the type of food Kaiju offers and made sure I have a pleasant experience.

*Chicken Katsu Curry - $8
The chicken katsu came out piping hot and fresh as Kaiju deep fried the katsu per order. I liked how they placed the katsu on the rice with no sauce poured over, so the meat wasn't going to get soggy easily. Unlike other restaurants, the chicken katsu at Kaiju were lightly breaded, and left a good amount of thickness of the chicken meat, which allowed it to stay moist. The chicken was crunchy and tender on the inside, and the coleslaw was surprisingly  good! The curry itself was smooth and not too thin. I also liked that the curry had a nice transition of sweetness to spiciness, and the spices didn't get muddled among the sweetness of the curry. Overall I actually prefered Kaiju's curry over Gyugyuya on Dundas street.

*Malaysian Char Keow Tiau - $8.95: 
I thought this was just an average stir fried noodles dish and it was incredibly salty. My throat was craving for water after having a few bites, so I felt they used a lot of MSG for this dish :(.

*Tofu cheesecake:
Another reason why I love coming to Kaiju is their tofu cheesecake and the regular Japanese cotton cheesecake. Although the Japanese cheesecake is bigger and a bit more expensive, trust me, the cake tasted exactly the same as Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake. However for both cakes, Kaiju only sell them by slices on Saturday, otherwise you have to place an order in advance for the cakes.

The base is a thin layer of gram crackers and brown sugar I believe. Although the base is quite sweet, the top layer of unsweetened tofu nicely balanced out the sweetness from the base. The tofu itself was really smooth and silky, it was almost like eating a pana cotta lol."}
{"text":"First of all, if you've never been to Kaiju, you'll probably get lost. Located in the basement food court in the Bed Bath and Beyond building, kaiju is a little stall selling Japanese katsu curry. 
And boy do they do it well. I usually order the chicken or pork but heard the fish is fantastic as well. They give a generous amount of curry and a side of coleslaw as well. It will definitely satisfy your jap curry cravings for a cheap price."}
{"text":"Holy smokes. I'm truly blown away. 

Japanese curry for the longest time making a splash in the food scene, while it's still currently being overunned by Ramen and Sushi places but this gem here is truly a wonderful place to check out.

The location is kind of obscure and admittedly I had trouble finding the place, consistently going up and down Yonge and not understanding where on Earth this place is.  Suddenly it dawned on me, that there's a unknown food court at the Marshall's/Bed, Bath and Beyond. So for all you people that are looking for Kaiju, just go down to the basement when you see the Marshall's, Bed, Bath and Beyond (trust me on this).

It's in a food court where it's still in development, and there are a few units that still haven't made its home for business, there were like 3-4 actually there, and I went on a Saturday so one of them was closed.

In any case, this food court is where Kaiju does its business and I have to say it's arguably one of the best places for Japanese curry. Ever.  I'm not sure if i was speaking with the owner but the person who was servicing me was the sweetest person ever, kind and pleasant to be around.  

So I ordered a Fish fillet curry for $8 and ask for less rice (low carb) and shockingly they were willing to give me less rice for more coleslaw salad.  The employee then went ahead and told me, while I was enjoying the meal that they could accommodate no rice and all salad, which is a huge bonus.

As for the meal itself...I...I'm truly at a loss of words.  The curry has a small kick, but it has a nice sweetness to it which is comforting and delicious.  The fish fillet was HUGE, woah..., and freshly fried (the thing was piping hot) and the coleslaw was really nice, not overdressed and crunchy. I found myself just downing that colossal meal in...minutes. Really wonderful wonderful meal.

I should also mention that the employee actually came out of her store unit to bring the food over to me and I was really surprised how wonderful service is (although as a disclaimer: I don't think they can do this all the time, especially if they're really busy, but they always have a big smile on their faces, which I do appreciate).

In any case, I'm rambling beyond belief because I can't stop talking how fantastic this place. Just GO to Kaiju.  This is a direct order. You'll be happy. :)"}
{"text":"I didn't think much of this place when I first chanced upon it. To be fair, a lot of Japanese curry I've had in the city tends to be fairly lackluster and not really impressive in any sort of way. 

Then came Kaiju.

It was sweeter than I was used to, but in a good way. The aromas were incredible! I'm not used to my mouth watering as soon as I lifted the lid but it did!

The curry was sweet, and my fried fish was crispy and flaky.  It was an incredible combination. I got it with four lines of hot sauce and I can tell you all now that that was a terrible mistake on my part. My mouth was burning! Just from four little lines! I'd think a safe recommendation is 2 or 3, and this is coming from someone who can eat Korean fire noodles with no problem.

It's a bit hidden away to get from here, being in the basement of the large aura building, but there are lots of neat shops. I wish more people would come and try it out!"}
{"text":"- Chicken Katsu one of the best I've had
- Exceptional service from the owner. Have never come across that in a food court
- Food court of the Aura Building. Quiet spot.
- Go on Saturday and try their Tofu Cheesecake
- Going back to try the Kaiju poutine."}
{"text":"I've lived by this little food court for a while and finally made the trip down to try it out. First impressions left me confused because the chicken katsu is $8.75 and came in a pretty small portion, but many reviews have considered this to be inexpensive. I'm a small person and was able to finish my meal with no problem. The chicken was excellent, contrary to others I found the curry to be just right and not too sweet, and the \"cole slaw\" I didn't really have any complaints about either as I just ate it with the curry as I did the rice. I would probably come back if I'm craving Japanese curry (only for the chicken though, otherwise I would probably go to gyugyuya)."}
{"text":"Location can be hard to find but if you want the best Japanese-style curry in Toronto it's worth the hunt."}
{"text":"I got the chicken Katsu. It was delicious and they give you lots of curry so you can put it on your chicken, your rice, and anything else you may want. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great Japanese Style Curry (Less spicy, less coconutty/thin, but more brothy/creamy than its Indian and Thai cousins). Put that over a nicely battered and fried piece of pork,chicken or fish and voila. It's in the basement food court of the new Aura Condo. Best for take out or a quick sit down as the food court is really quiet since it's new."}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly owners! Sort of tough to find, so pay attention to the other reviews."}
{"text":"Yesterday after work, I decided to drop by Kaiju after reading a chowhound review & recommendation.  Kaiju is in the food court of the basement of the new Aura Condo Towers at Yonge/Gerrard, just take the escalator down and follow the signs. They serve Japanese curry, which I've never had before.  Interestingly, they also seem to serve Malaysian dishes as well.  That kind of combination is a bit rare in Toronto so I had to try it out.

I ordered the Chicken Katsu, a dish of chicken cutlet, with japanese curry, white rice, and a side salad.  The cutlet was crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside but not too greasy.  The star of the show was the curry however.  I was met with a very interesting balance of flavors.  A blend of sweet and savoury flavors with a hint of spices.  The curry has a very rich flavor and it's definitely worth checking out.  I would definitely come back to try the other curry dishes and Malaysian dishes as well."}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious food. I had the chicken katsu and it was so good! Try their homemade coconut jam! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is really a hidden gem. You would've never thought to find a place like this tucked in a corner of a semi-closed food court. I got the pork katsu plate which comes with rice and slaw. The portion was just perfect for me and the price was inexpensive. I loved how the pork was thinly breaded and fried to perfection with it not being dry at all. The curry on the other hand was a bit too sweet for my liking. Overall, good katsu!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in an isolated, quiet underground food court area that seems pretty dead and empty, a lot of shops here are closed down and a lot of restaurant stalls in the food court are closed. This place is surprisingly really delicious! We got the pork katsu and even though it was a bit spicy it was still pretty enjoyable to eat.

We enjoyed the curry chicken katsu with rice in a take out box for approximately $10. The portion seemed a bit small, but it came with a lot of sauce and a big piece of chicken cutlet.

The food took a bit longer than expected for it to come out for food court food, but wasn't longer than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Lovely little joint.  I was diverted through the underground food court over the holidays when falling ice kept people from walking down the street above.  Glad I did.  I ordered the special, the mama chicken  - a lovely dish.  Accompanied by rice and salad.  Also tried the chicken katsu on a later occasion - another treat. 

Glad I got down there when it was quiet, as I'm sure the place is going to take off.   

Take the time to find your way down to this little gem, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great service despite being just a foodcourt restaurant. Fish is soft and juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. Sauce is just the right amount of spicy and salty."}
{"text":"Best Japanese style curry in Toronto. Definitely a must try. I had have tried the pork katsu and the chicken katsu so far. Both are dishes that are worth coming back for again and again. The service is also fast and friendly. Definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"the meat is cooked perfectly. even without the curry, it's really delicious. the sauce is complex, a lot of depth of flavor. if you have a japanese curry craving, go to japan or go here. simple as that. the mall and food court are weird. eat and leave."}
{"text":"This is a really solid place to eat. Price is pretty reasonable, portions are good. I had the chicken Katsu and it was very good. The curry was full of flavour. I devoured the meal in about 10 minutes. The only real knock that I can give it, is that I wish the portion was a little bit bigger because it was so good. If you're looking for a quick bite to eat to get the job done, this is a great option in the area. The owners are very nice and friendly too. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Very tasty Japanese katsu curry options - you can even choose panko breaded cutlets or grilled options. The curry meals cost $8 so drink costs a dollar extra, but still a good option for students. Never tried their other Asian fusion items though. Location isn't the best since it's located underground (Shops at Aura) which is very quiet inside. Hopefully things will change in the future. Chinese owners are very friendly and they do ask feedback on your meal."}
{"text":"I've been back to Kaiju a few times since my initial review, so time for an update! 

Was feeling a bit under the weather and wanted something tasty and comforting - Kaiju came to mind immediately and I knew it was time to get some Chicken Katsu! 

The food court is still as abandoned as ever, but this place manages to bring people in. I left my office just about 12 and after I'd ordered, another 8 or so people showed up to order lunch. Come early or be prepared to wait a few minutes longer for hot and tasty chicken!

I really like the food here; the curry is super flavorful and not too spicy but it definitely has some spices to bring the flavor up a few notches. I don't know why people are complaining about the portion size, for just over $11 with a drink, a deep fried chicken fillet, rice and coleslaw, its a pretty good sized meal. That being said, I have this for lunch. If it was for dinner, I'd probably add some shrimp on to make it go a little further.

Definitely worth a stop by if you want something a little different than the typical burgers, pizza and shwarma you'll find in the area."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in the Downtown Centre area. First, it's almost impossible to find unless you actually try and look for it. Knowing there's a small food court on the basement floor of the Aura condos/store helps. There's a Bed Bath and Beyond in the building as well. The restaurant itself is a standard food court restaurant where you order at the counter. For us, since we went at a slow time, they even brought out the food to our table. Not sure if that's standard practice or not.

My family and I got the Pork Katsu, Chicken Katsu, and the Grilled Chicken plates. This comes with the aforementioned items, plus some rice, the curry, and a small salad. Speaking to the owner, she mentioned that the style of curry is Malaysian and that they've been compared favorably to Go Go Curry in New York. I've only tried the Go Go Curry in Boston and I can say for certain that the curry at Kaiju is WAY better. I don't know what they put in it, by its worth the trek. My only complaint of the meal is that the portions seemed a bit small to me.

Service was excellent also. Seeing the other reviews, I'm not surprised. The owner is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Because of the fantastic reviews on yelp I decided to try the place. Turns out I'm quite disappointed. Paid 9.89$ for this picture below. The food tasted ok but I don't find any attractiveness to going back."}
{"text":"The taste of homemade curry is so amazing! I had a chat with the chef, he told me that his master is from Japan and also a Michelin grant chef, so that's why they have special recipe. It's worth to try."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Kaiju was when they first opened almost two years ago. I had heard great things about Kaiju, but I was still apprehensive about the quality of the food. I mean, they are in a food court - how great could it possibly be? Well, I was definitely pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious, fresh and decently priced (most items under $10). But what really made them great and separated them from most food establishments was the service. The Kaiju team is kind, passionate, professional and so thankful for your business. They truly love making people happy ...

So why did I stay away for over 6 months? Cause I am an idiot! I've been busy and did not make the trek to the Gerrard and Yonge area until last Saturday when I had a major craving for curry and fish. I brought my friend with me who had never tried Kaiju, and he really enjoyed the meal. But what he fell head over heels in love with was their tofu cheesecake. So much so, that he goes to Kaiju every Saturday to stock up on tofu cheesecake (they only sell it on Saturdays). 

Take a wild guess where we are going today? Yep! On our way now!"}
{"text":"Who knew? Underneath the downtown Aura plaza at a dingy basement food court is home to such a gem of an eatery. Absolutely fabulous experience for all katsu lovers. Batter was light, crispy not greasy; the curry sauce was well textured and flavour was on point; Meat and seafood were fried to perfection and remained moist. One suggestion would be to keep the salad extra cold when served; you need that temperature balance (also a squeeze of lemon would make the platters perfect). 

I usually get the pork katsu. But Get the monster kaiju for two if you're hungry (4 extra large shrimp, large piece of fish, pork cutlet) Their other items are delicious as well including fried rice and tofu cheesecake."}
{"text":"I came to check out Kaiju after reading some of the reviews here on yelp. Unfortunately it isn't the kind of food I can eat. I was really disappointed. All the dishes on their menu had curry in it and I'm can't eat curry without experiencing digestive issues. So just an FYI, people who can't eat curry or don't like curry don't go here. I'm giving this place a 3/5 because I didn't actually get to eat the food. But I couldn't tell that from the reviews of other people for this place.

This food court is really tiny. There were only two other places serving food and the pictures didn't look appetizing. This place is really hidden which is too bad because the people trying to make a living in this building probably have a hard time getting customers. The seating at this food court was plentiful since there was hardly anyone there but the people that were there were really noisy. If you're looking for a quiet place to eat this isn't it."}
{"text":"After Yelping for some Asian comfort food my wife, daughter, and I decided upon Kaiju.  My wife really likes the Korean version of this dish and we even make it at home sometimes. Therefore this really is comfort food. 
Kaiju isn't easy to find if you're from out of town, but we eventually made our down and then snaked around to a back corner where the three stalls in this part of the food court were random Asian food choices. 
The service was friendly and really wanted to make us happy. My daughter made her pick first, some grilled chicken skewers. I went with the pork katsu and my wife got chicken. We sat at a nearby table and 5-10mins later they brought out our styrofoam containers with hot from oven food. The food tasted and looked fresh, the portions were perfect for a filling lunch, and it smelled good.
I gave my daughter half of my rice and we all chowed down. Her chicken was good and other than the one bite that I took she finished it.  My pork katsu was fried to perfection and the curry sauce was good, not great due to sweetness and consistency, but good.  My wife enjoyed her chicken katsu and was happy to have found this place.  Neither of us ate more than a bit of the bland extremely chunky cole slaw.
If you're cruising through the subway or in the area I'd definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"God dam! This place is the best, super tasty and filling. Only bad thing is their location so not everyone can know about this awesome restaurant!"}
{"text":"Situated inside a mall, foodcourt below Bath Bath Beyond...kinda hidden ..oh boy it's definitely some good quality japanese curry and katsu. The meat is tender and portion is just right. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Not too much to add that the previous Yelp reviews didn't cover already.

Ordered the chicken katsu ($9.00) to go.  Chicken remained crispy during commute back to the office.  Opened the lid to release the scent of yummy curry wafting through the office and curious coworkers poking their head in to see what smelled so good.

Only complaint, my entree could have used thrice the amount of curry gravy.  Forgive me, but I like to eat most of my meals like a stew with the food drowned in sauce or gravy.  Will request extra curry next time."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype, I'm sorry! 
I tried the Malaysian Sambal Udon, and it was fairly bland and uninteresting. Although there was some spice to it, I don't recall any unique or strong flavour to it. The udon was cooked well, not too much oil, so at least it was an okay dish overall, but nothing special. 
I had some of my friend's Chicken Katsu Curry, and I didn't really enjoy the curry. I thought there was a strange banana flavour to it that became less appetizing as I kept eating. Katsu was well made though. 
If I'm ever in the area maybe I'll try their tofu cheesecake, but I wouldn't come back for their mains."}
{"text":"I came across this little food court on Yelp and immediately set out on a mission (dragging my slightly concerned sister along). 

This food court and mall is literally dead during the week. 
I ordered the monster combo to try a little of everything (chicken, shrimp, and fish). 

When my sister went up to grab the food the man behind the counter insisted on bringing it to our food court table for us. 

I loooved the food. It was definitely enough to fill 2 people. The curry was thick and savoury. I loved how they added in coleslaw to balance out all the deep fried protein. The chicken was great and wasn't dried out. The shrimp actually had a great amount of meat on and wasn't just a ball of fried dough like other Katsu places. But the fish definitely stood out. The fish was flavorful, huge, and crispy. It was so good my sister came back ordered only the fish Katsu the next day. 

I'll definitely come back when I go Eatons again. This is a hidden gem inside a dying mall."}
{"text":"Happy to add to the Kaiju love-in, although my lack of J-Curry expertise prevents me from giving it a higher score. 

Located in the catacombs (or half-empty basement retail concourse) of the Aura condominiums, Kaiju is one of a few lonely outposts in what may one day become an actual honest-to-goodness food court. 

Honestly, if it weren't for Yelp I don't know if anyone would even know this place exists. But they do, and they come in droves. In fact, Kaiju's relative isolation may be a good thing. Tables are available and clean, and the nearby washrooms are in generally good condition. 

Ordering is simple. Servers are friendly and swift (then again, everybody orders chicken katsu, so why wouldn't they be). My food arrives within a few minutes or ordering, fresh and piping hot. I pass on an overpriced diet coke, and take my mysterious eats to my table. 

I usually write a place up after trying a few dishes, but consensus seems to be that Kaiju's strongest suit is their curry. I'm a curry fan, so I figured I'd give it a shot. When I open the lid, a burst of curry fragrance hits me. I see 'salad' that owes more to Caribbean-style cole slaw, a large portion of rice, a paper-thin chicken cutlet, and a pool of yellowy-brown goo-the famous curry sauce. 

Each component works well, but the lot is much better when all are present and accounted for in one big bite. The chicken is a paper-thin cutlet fried to a brittle golden brown (I actually think it was a bit overdone, but the breading was shatteringly crisp). Rice is well, rice...not too firm, not too mushy. The curry itself was deeply flavoured, less spicy and more fruity than I'd have expected. 

Taken together, a pretty tight little lunch plate for under $10. 

If the ambience ever improves, I'd be tempted to go back."}
{"text":"This curry was one of the BEST meals! It's located in a strange little underground strip mall that's pretty much closed, but I promise it's worth it to go down there. It's clean and bright, so you don't have to worry about it being scary or anything. The woman who was working the cashier/ our waitress was so sweet and came to check on us throughout the meal even though it's really a food court type set up. Most everyone down there was there for the Curry and I don't blame them.
Favorites:
The CURRY!! Delicious! I even got an extra side of the sauce. YUMMMMM
Chicken Katsu- Moist with a great crunch!

When I'm back in Toronto I will definitely be back and I'd love to try the Cheesecake! This hit the spot! You have to check it out!"}
{"text":"Coleslaw, rice, chicken katsu, gravy, owners, service - everything about this place is absolutely fantastic. I believe the owners are from Malaysia and they're super friendly with their customers. Even though it's located in the food court, they go far and beyond what you expect from even a restaurant. They seem genuinely interested in getting to know you, engaging in conversation as you wait for your order, sometimes even asking how everything is as you eat in the food court, and best of all, they remember you!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem amongst the quiet Shops at Aura foodcourt. Once you know your way to Kaiju, it will keep you coming back for more. If you like Japanese Curry style and Malaysian style food.
Brian who does the japanese curry concotion mix is also a good chat. Its one of the places with closer taste to home if you like the Malaysian style cooking. The Japanese style curry is also somewhat interesting.
They also sell homemade kaya once a while. Keeps be going back ever so often."}
{"text":"I was debating between chicken and pork curry, and ended up getting the Chicken curry. 
I found the sauce to be a bit too sweet for curry. 
The chicken was fresh from the fryer and tasted amazing. Its a good combo, but still too sweet for me.

The gentleman that works there (owner) was extremely polite. He brought us the food to our table, and even came back again to ask if everything was good. 

I didnt really have issues finding the place as I already knew it was downstairs. Once youre there, there is a sign guiding to the food court. 

I'll be back to try the Pork and tofu cheesecake"}
{"text":"If I ever become an English teacher, I'd teach the children to spell \"gem\" as \"Kaiju\"

Enough said, I ordered the chicken katsu. The meal comes with rice, coleslaw and some curry sauce. The checken was tender but crispy, and the Japanese style curry sauce on top of the katsu is just great - it has a sweet aroma, and it tastes really smooth.
The most important thing is the meal is not greasy at all. In contrast to many other katsu restaurants, Kaiju's cutlets really stand out.

Will definitely visit often - I will also bring friends over sometimes."}
{"text":"ok ok ok... 3.5/5
this is a good fried chicken or pork - curry - rice place, like any such (fast-food type) place in Japan. I had same over there (for much cheaper and warmer on the plate).

as there are no similar places here downtown, it is clearly the best for those specific menu items. and yes, the owner is a really nice and attentive guy I think, who really wants to keep the quality of his food constant and good. however, one needs to take a few steps backwards before giving a 5-stars mark! this remains a fast-food thing, and one can find such things almost everywhere in Japan (especially in bus and train stations)!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for Katsu Curry Rice (Curry and Rice with a Pork or Chicken Cutlet.) A dish that I quite enjoyed in Japan. This is totally Japanese comfort food. Especially great when the weather gets a bit chilly. I found Kaiju because of some reviews which highly rated them. I was not expecting a food court stall. But the food did not disappoint.

I ordered the Pork Cutlet with Curry & Rice. The cutlet was a too thin (more Korean style.) But the curry was delicious and the light coleslaw that was included went very well with the curry too. My friend had the Chicken Karage (similar to Popcorn Chicken, but slightly larger.) He said the Karage was quite good. And he knows the dish from Japan. So you can trust his judgment.

Also because it just piqued our curiosity, we sampled the Cheese Omelette with Curry & Rice. The cheese was very generous and the omelette had a great flavour from lots of green onion and veggies.

There are a couple of other Asian stalls (a sushi and noodle stall and a Korean BimBimBab) which also seemed to go beyond what you might expect from a food court in the same location. The clientele was nearly all Asian. So you know the food is good and the word is out. So if you want some good Asian food choices, this is a great spot."}
{"text":"What else can I say about this place that hasn't been said? Their curry is amazing. I'm dying to try their take on Poutine but every time I go I get captivated by their standard curry dishes, usually chicken or pork. If I could walk around with their curry in a camelback so I could eat it all the time, I totally would. Hard to find, but once you do, you'll know why it's the only shop with any customers where it is"}
{"text":"For mall food, this is definitely one of the best I have ever had - not a very lofty standard but oh well. Once you get past its weird location, it's smooth sailing from there.

We had the Kaiju Jumbo Combo for 2 and it was excellent. Ours came with pork katsu, fried shrimp, fried fish, rice, and curry. The fried shrimp and fish were alright, but the pork katsu was delicious. Even better than the pork katsu was the curry. This curry was sweet, hot, and savory. I just wish they had some sort of cabbage to go with how heavy everything felt.

Other than that, everything was great from the prices to the customer service. I'll be coming back the next time I visit Toronto for sure!"}
{"text":"This foodcourt stall made me sad. I wandered in here based on Yelp reviews and was so excited to try their tofu cheesecake (didnt have it on a weekday), sambal udon and char kwai teow but they don't serve the noodles anymore. Ended up getting the chicken karaage and chicken katsu. The curry was spicy and good, but the portions were small for their prices and isn't really worth the hype in my opinion. I wouldnt go out of my way to go back again and there are plenty of places around youge and dundas/eaton center for cheaper and better eats."}
{"text":"Location: It is located in the food court of the Shops of Aura shopping plaza (entrance off Yonge) - a bit tough to find as it is tucked away in the corner.

Food: I had a hard time deciding but the super friendly lady at the counter recommended their japanese curry and katsu. I ordered the pork katsu with curry sauce, cabbage slaw and rice. The pork katsu was made and fried right in front of me - it was nicely cut up in to slices. Each bite was crispy and moist still inside without being overly greasy. Curry sauce was good - not very spicy but more like a flavourful gravy. This went well with rice and cabbage slaw. 

In general - great flavours and portions - it hit my spot for Japanese curry! The noodles actually look quite tasty so I will definitely come back and try their other options."}
{"text":"I ventured into the Aura condo/tower basement to find the much talked-about Kaiju, to satisfy my Japanese comfort food craving. First off, the area the food court is in reminds me of the under-developed plazas in far-off Markham. Lots of empty store fronts and a lot of Asian vibe.

Ordered the Chicken Katsu. For $9, you get a salad, rice, a good chunk of crispy fried chicken and covered generously with Japanese curry. I walked home with my little take out box, and every step was torture because the smell of the curry just permeated through the container and I was starvingggg. Worth every penny. Even after a 20 minute walk, the chicken was still crispy on the outside. Curry and rice was perfect. 

I will be going again, mark my words. And for $9! Good deal!"}
{"text":"This place is literally the first bookmark I made on when I first made this account. I finally got the chance to come here and try their infamous Japanese curry and wow it was really good! I got their Kaiju poutine (amazing) and pork katsu (beautiful). I've had Singaporean curry and I find that the two are almost similar, both sweet and not spicy. I would for sure come back to try their other items."}
{"text":"The location sucks coz it's underground but this Kaiju's curry is perfect! Service is good and the owner is super nice! Always trying to remember every customers and talk with them! It's not pricy at all! Good for take out for students around Ryerson and UofT!"}
{"text":"The shop was a little bit hard to find at first as it is located in the basement floor under Aura building. 

By the time I got there, I realized that there are a few option for Japanese and Korean foods to choose. I still decided to try out Kaiju because I heard many good things about it. 

Most Japanese katsu curry dishes are $8.50 that includes a big katsu meat, rice, and salad. Although the price is fair, I hope the portion could be bigger. 

As I ordered takeout today, the lady didn't pack it properly so the sauce all spilled out. I was a little bit upset but the meal was very delicious so I have no complaint about it. However I could not give 5 stars because it was a quite bad experience carrying a bag of spilled sauce around. Hopefully that my next experience is better because their foods are delicious and I would happily rate them with all 5 stars.  

Overall, I will comeback one day and totally recommend this place for lunch. It's one of the quickest, most convenient, and affordable in the area."}
{"text":"Really good food, for a good price! 

Would have given it 5 stars, however, it was in a very hidden location, and I wouldn't have found this place if my boyfriend hadn't gone exploring in this area.

Really good customer service too, the people who work there are super friendly."}
{"text":"As hidden as gems get, this spot is located in a desolate basement food court a block or so from Yonge-Dundas Square. How anyone would ever find it without yelp is beyond me. Thankfully, yelp lead our taste buds straight here. Apparently on Saturdays they sell tofu cheesecake by both the slice and the cake and that their take on it will blow minds far and wide. We did not visit on a Saturday. Oh well. We stuck with the savory and ordered some chicken katsu to share. Ooh yeah it is tasty. A solid lunch portion of nicely sliced fried chicken atop a slaw and rice, with a large pool of gravy to the side. That gravy sets it apart. It tastes spectacular with all three items in the dish and brings it to a brand new level rarely seen in a katsu dish. Definitely recommended. I would frequent here if I lived nearby. Can't beat the price, either."}
{"text":"Nestled in a deserted food court is the gem serving Japanese curry. The food was good, freshly fried katsu with a sweet curry sauce.
It's quick, affordable and even though it's a food court restaurant, the service is impeccable. The cashier, whom I'm assuming is the owner, is super sweet and not only brought our food to our table when it was ready, but followed up on our experience when we were done. I'd feel guilty if I never came back here!"}
{"text":"I found this hidden gem on Google. Turns out there is a mall under the Aura condo on Yonge and Gerrard that I didn't know about and its home to a pretty remarkable Japanese curry establishment. Once you wander the empty halls of the mall you'll find a mostly barren food court with Kaiju hopping with life and energy in one corner. Pretty much everyone in the food court is there to eat at Kaiju and thats a testament to the quality of food there. If it can bring people into a mostly abandoned mall for food, then its probably destined for greater things in a prime location elsewhere in the city.

I eat the chicken or pork katsu typically once a week for lunch. The prices are great, the breaded chicken and curry sauce are fantastic, and the staff is incredibly friendly. If they're not too busy they'll hand you your food if your sitting at a food court table and the owner will come by to make sure you and your food are getting aquatinted in the best way. There's this awesome harmony to the curry sauce that I personally have not had better anywhere else for this style of curry.

I always try to order something else when I go but the chicken/pork katsu is kind of amazing so until that unlikely day where I decide to order something else, chicken/pork all the time every time."}
{"text":"3.5 Star

Kaiju Hot is spicy! Yes really spicy but the spiciness comes from the ghost pepper hot sauce they added to the basic curry. Luckily, you can really adjust your own level of spiciness by how much you mix the hot sauce with the curry base.

My chicken katsu was crispy and crunchy. I like how it was served separate from the curry so it stayed crunchy all these time when I was enjoying my meal slowly.

The nice man at the counter was eyeing me eating my food. I have to keep telling him I am OK. 

A note about Aura's Food Court where Kaiju is located: no wireless signal at all, no text, no calls, no data access... a black hole."}
{"text":"This place is unfortunately buried in the isolated dead mall under the Aura building. I have been here 3 times since its first opening, and I am very surprised and happy to see how busy their business is at lunch time nowadays, surrounded by still for lease commercial places. Their katsu is consistently great, crispy thin outside and tender juicy inside. Worth the extra effort to find this place."}
{"text":"I always see this place listed on my Yelp homepage as one of the best food places in Toronto, so I made a point to try it out. It's just a fast food place in the basement food court of the Aura building, and it's not that busy, so you don't have to wait too long. The lady working at the cash register was soooo so friendly and such a sweetheart. When she found out it was my first time at Kaiju, she gave me a little cup with rice and curry sauce to sample. I ordered the chicken katsu which was like $8+ tax and comes with some coleslaw on the side. The portion was big for what you pay - there is a lot of rice, but also a good amount of meat/slaw. You will definitely be full.

I am not even exaggerating though when I say that the katsu was amazing. It was like a pretty big piece of breaded chicken cut into 6 strips, but I still wish there was more because it was so good. It was lightly breaded and perfectly fried to a golden crisp... soooo delicious. Their Japanese curry is apparently a homemade blend of over 14 ingredients including fresh fruits and vegetables, and it is also really really good, although I do not know too much about Japanese curry. I can say that it was indeed flavourful, but not in that artificial, overly salty, MSG-loaded way. It is just a tad spicy, and started to build up a bit for me towards the end, but it was still tolerable. They let you customize your level of spice if you want.

Honestly this place is a hidden gem, will be returning!"}
{"text":"The chicken katsu is delicious, served with rice and coleslaw. The hot sauce they make is fire! And flavourful. A hidden spot in the Aura building, this place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Love their curry and the owner Brian is friendly and very hospitable. The place is hidden. You need to go down the escalator, and the food court is a maze to the left side.

They are closed on Sundays and I have been told by the owner that they started serving Tofu Cheesecake on Saturdays.

Also recommend trying out Kaya jam. Great for breakfast, not overly sweet, and it's only $5 for one container."}
{"text":"Located in a eerily empty basement mall, Kaiju is single-handedly keeping the plaza alive.

The curry's on the sweet side, with a hint of fruit. I prefer the pork katsu to the chicken katsu - the pork meat is thicker, giving it texture and body, but the chicken meat is thin and tasteless. The batter in both cases is fresh and crispy - they fry it right when you order. The rice is acceptable, but as other reviewers have mentioned, better rice would really elevate it. Overall, the curry dishes aren't too oily at all - I can eat a ton without feeling sick, unlike a lot of other fast food."}
{"text":"As everyone else has said, Kaiju is located in the most depressing food court I have ever seen. The place was completely deserted. The basement is like a ghost town - 85% of the shop space was empty, and there were only 3 places - including Kaiju - open.

The staff at Kaiju are very friendly and fast, and they'll bring your order to you at your table once the food is ready.

Finally, and most importantly, THE FOOD. I got the Combo for Two, and the katsu were amazing. The panko crusting was crisp and golden, and the meats were all high-quality. The pork and shrimp were both excellent, but the real stand out for me was the fish. Seriously, this was the best fish (fish & chips style) I have ever had. AMAZING.

The slaw was pretty decent and the veggies were all really fresh, the rice was pretty meh - I expected more out of rice at a Japanese place, and the curry was 3.5/5 stars.

In conclusion: definitely go for the katsu."}
{"text":"There are no words to describe that curry sauce... I salivate just thinking about it!! Go and try it out! I dare you."}
{"text":"Flirting between three to three and a half stars for Kaiju. I shared the Chicken Katsu with my co-worker during lunch in the office ($8.00). The chicken was fried well. It was tender, juicy, crispy. The main drawback was the thin cut of meat. A lower grade rice was used, as another reviewer had also mentioned. The grained lacked the traditional slightly sticky texture of Japanese uruchimai rice. 

My colleague response was, \"four pieces of chicken for almost $10...I think I paid $5 for the sauce\". Realistically, the sauce, rice, protein and cole slaw could have easily fit in a small takeout contained. (Ritz Caribbean Foods has been exceling at that for years! Take notes Kaiju! ) 

While the flavours were great, we both agree it was overpriced."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one day and had the curry chicken katsu. It's in a little food court that is a bit tucked away. Reasonably priced and filling, great flavours. Service was quick and friendly. It was worth the trek away from all the chain food stalls in food courts you see everywhere else downtown. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, good value.  I ordered the pork with curry. Made fresh and hot. Quiet food court. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is the true definition of a hidden gem considering how good the food is and how isolated it is. It's in a barren food court at the bottom of the aura buildings and deserves a lot more traffic than it gets. The katsu curry is amazing and so is the salad that comes with it even. I tried the tori karaage this time instead and it was delicious too although I still think I prefer the katsu dishes. The portions are fair and the service is excellent too. Even though it's in a fast food court the cashier/owner/cook brought out our food for us."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in the basement mall of the Aura building, southwest corner of Yonge and Gerrard. It's a pretty deserted mall and the Cantonese owners who I spoke with had mentioned they are planning to move locations in the near future.

As for the food I ordered their chicken katsu served with steamed rice and coleslaw which came out to $9.89. The big hearty pieces of chicken are lightly breaded while the curry sauce is sweet and wraps it up all together. I opted to add their spicy sauce, where if I were to guess, is a habanero based sauce and would be mad spicy to people who aren't used to it. Only downside was the coleslaw which was missing the 'tang' you normally taste with coleslaw, it tastes more like an afterthought rather than a complimentary side dish.

Overall pretty good and with the price that it is I would recommend."}
{"text":"Got the chicken katsu which was reallllyyy good! Meat was tender and crispy, and the curry was perfect. Service was excellent as well. The lady at the counter was super smiley and friendly, and even brought our food to out table even though it was a foodcourt (and came by to ask if the food was good midway through). Only reason why I docked off a star was because the grilled fish my friend ordered was a on the salty side."}
{"text":"Service: Really sweet and friendly owners who like to joke with you. You order and they bring the food to you which takes a few minutes
Food: the portion is just right and the curry is good. It's different from the curry that you might make from the blocks from the supermarket because it has an underlying fruity taste (banana-y, not in an unpleasant way though).
Pro tip: tofu cheesecake is only available on Saturdays"}
{"text":"So far the best Japanese curry I've tasted in Toronto. I have tried a number of Katsu curry places in Toronto, NYC, and LA and this one ranks high. The owners are very friendly, price is decent, and the place was relatively easy to find.
I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"been here tons of times since opening and mostly always get chicken katsu with coleslaw! the owner is super nice and will remember you and food is great and comes fast! such a pity this \"mall\" / \"food court\" is dead, they deserve their own restaurant or at least a place in urban eatery, they would do great I'm sure!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the reviews here. I don't normally come on to give a place a negative review, but I have to say that, given the two times I have visited, I have a few issues with the place:

* There's too much curry sauce. It just drenches everything.

* It's a pretty long wait for a place in a food court. (Although I must say that I was impressed that I was offered the opportunity to sit down and have the food brought to me.)

* It's not cheap!

* The atmosphere in the Aura food court is a bit dismal.

All of that said, the taste is unique, and the service is good. I would certainly give it a try -- maybe it'd be more to your liking than to mine!"}
{"text":"Thank you for the amazing food and service!! Must try the tofu cheesecake (made only on the weekends) if you guys can!!!!"}
{"text":"Owner Brian is very friendly. The location is very hidden butthe food is worth it--affordable yet tasty, this is the gem you want to stock."}
{"text":"Found this little place in the food court. The chicken katsu is delicious! I will be back, for sure."}
{"text":"Located in the food court in the bottom of Aura the place is a small take away featuring a selection of Asian dishes. Kare is a warm wintery food that kept me going when I lived in Tokyo. There it was served from street stalls steaming and warm. The curry is delicious with an assortment of toppings, including katsu, fish and shimp. More than generous portions. Would love to see a vegetarian and tofu curry added to the menu."}
{"text":"I found this based on the good Yelp review. It is located in the food court in the same building as Marshall. The food court was dead during lunch time in a weekday. But that's the best part as i prefer somewhere spacious and lots seating area.

I ordered the curry chicken like everyone else. The curry was good, not much flavour but not too salty or spicy. But I wasn't impressed about the chicken. I found the meat was over processed, it almost tasted like ham. Therefore, I had concern about how fresh the meat was . I would prefer if they use regular chicken or perhaps not deep fried.

I will not go back unless they change the chicken."}
{"text":"The sauce is amazing, the service is great. It's cheap as hell and its incredible fusion. 
The only problem are their timings and location."}
{"text":"Hard to find, because it's in the basement of a building, but I hope this place sticks around! The food is unique, and the owners are so friendly!

I had the Kaiju Poutine. It was savoury, flavourful, and vegetarian! The fries were thick and crispy."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but this place is a must visit if you enjoy Japanese curry at all. Tucked away in a sad little food court, more people should make the trek as the curry is so tasty. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I'd recommend everyone who hasn't had Katsu Curry to try Kaiju.

Even though the store is not ran by Japanese people, the Malaysian cook and manager were trained at a Japanese cuisine school in Malaysia.

THE GOOD

1. Fresh and tasty. The food comes quickly, but is always prepared fresh. Your best bets are to go either very early at opening, or during the meal rushes for the freshest batches.

2. Cheap. The price is quite good, especially since traditional Japanese restaurants are quite pricey.

THE BAD

1. Hard to find for the FIRST time. Once you know how to get there, it's pretty convenient.

2. Deserted, sterile food court. It lacks the ambiance of a restaurant.

3. Presentation is mediocre. It's basically fast food, so the food isn't very pretty. Packaged in simply styrofoam boxes, served with plastic forks."}
{"text":"At the suggestion of my fellow Yelpers, I ordered the chicken katsu which came with rice, curry and coleslaw. The chicken was cooked perfectly. Super crispy on the outside and so juicy on the inside. Yuuuuum. Might've been the best chicken katsu I've ever had! The curry was really rich and delicious, but there wasn't quite enough of it to go with the rice. Service was friendly and quick too! Another great, affordable and fast lunch spot close to my office! Win."}
{"text":"Thank you, Kaiju, for existing. I don't give out five stars that easily but this place takes the cake. It's filling, delicious, and cheap! 10/10 recommend, come here for a good time. It's never too busy either, at least not during the hours I visit (after lunch hours and before dinner hours) and it's tucked away in the basement of aura building. 

As soon as you walk into the building, head straight down the escalators, walk straight and head left once you see the restaurant signage. You'll be greeted by the emptiness of everything save for the glory that is Kaiju. I walked by its lonely neighbour without even realizing there was a ramen/sushi place right next to it. 

Keep in mind the tofu cheesecake is only available on Saturdays; you can order the whole in advance. If you want your curry sauce to be at a certain spice level, you'll have to let them know. 

Their service is great, they always bring out your food after they're done and sometimes they even check up on you to accommodate all your needs. It's a lovely establishment, definitely come visit."}
{"text":"After seeing all the reviews, and having a craving for Japanese food, we decided to try Kaiju out. We were not disappointed. We got the curry chicken katsu and it was piping hot and fresh out the fryer! The curry was delicious and the chicken was tender and crunchy. The lady who served us was lovely and even suggested some places to visit while in Toronto. The location might seem a bit random but it's definitely worth a try if you're around the area! As we were leaving, we saw all the office workers on their way to the store so definitely must be a popular spot with the locals too."}
{"text":"Most reviews agree: best hidden gem!

The hard-to-find location, doesn't take away from this special shop earning 5 stars. If anything, it adds to the charm and rarity of it. Like, hidden treasure. You may have to work to find it the first time, but the rewards far outweigh the hunt.

I've been here many times now. And there really is no better place for Japanese curry.

ATMOSPHERE: Casual food court. Super quiet. Eerie at times, like a ghost town... but hey, you can always guarantee a table. And don't have to rush to finish your food.

SERVICE: The best. Super attentive. Owner will follow-up with you as you're eating - as if you're in a full-scale restaurant. Order your food at the counter, and he'll bring you your order. Sometimes, you'll get samples too.

PRICE: Very reasonable, with generous portions. The combos are great to share with 2 or more people, and you get to try a variety of meats.

FOOD: All the breaded meats are done perfectly - with the right amount of crunch but not a thick layer so it takes over the meat itself. I've tried all of the meat offerings, and although they are all delicious - the pork cutlet and fish filets are definitely my favourites. And the sauce. The curry is hands down the best I've had outside of Japan (I've been lucky to have visited twice). The curry is super flavourful, but not heavy. A perfect balance of sweet and savory. And for those who enjoy things spicy/hot (not me) - I am told their hot sauce is the best.


Bottom line, this is not a place to be missed!"}
{"text":"It was difficult to find, especially with stroller. But glad I found it. Chicken katsu was great. The curry is very tasty and the chicken remained crispy even 20 mins after being packed up in a steaming bag."}
{"text":"Kaiju, which means \"Monster\" or \"Strange Creature\" in Japanese, is the name of this family-owned Japanese Curry Restaurant, churning out monster-like flavors, not many people know about. 

This fast-food eatery is hidden away in the lower ground floor of the famous Aura condo building located at Yonge and Gerard. Although this place may be difficult to find, it has developed a following over the past year and known to serve the best Japanese Curry in town.

Unlike the curries of India, Thailand and other countries, Japanese curry is thicker, milder, sweeter and has more of a \"gravy-like\" consistency. Chef Brian of Kaiju, makes the curry from scratch and uses a blend of over 14 ingredients that are slow-cooked for two days over a low heat. To ensure the consistency in texture and flavour, Chef Brian spends many hours manually stirring the pot to achieve the monster-like flavours you get in each spoonful bite of his delicious curry. People often ask what his secret is, and really, it boils down to Chef Brian's love, passion and dedication he puts in each pot. 

You really have to try to see for yourself, but one this is clear, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"If this was in a more popular place, it would be packed. Since it's part of a small mall, we always get seats and there are usually no line ups. I think this place def deserves more attention because their curry is amazing, preferable to the gyugyuya down the street. You can buy a box for $9.04 and at filling without being too much. 
Also, the owner and the waitresses working there are the sweetest! They're very thorough in telling us everything about thee menu. They even bring the food to us at the food court! Love this place."}
{"text":"Kaiju is a great little food court restaurant, tucked away in the basement of the Aura building. It's no frills and great for take-out, although there are plenty of seats in the food court (it's not ambient...it's a basement food court, after all). I've had the chicken katsu and the pork katsu and I'm addicted. The portion sizes are filling for lunch and the food is hot and fresh, and most dishes only cost $8.50 + tax. I haven't come across that many places serving Japanese curry so this place is a gem for me. The last time I ate there I was so enthusiastic and ate so vigorously I scraped the roof of my mouth on the crispy pork. Not even sorry."}
