{"text":"We come here ALL the time. Food is always out fast, hot, delicious and pretty good size portions. Can't beat the prices either!!"}
{"text":"This place was messy and loud.  The food really wasn't great and the salsa bar looked like a three year old put it together.  Overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food.  I will not be back unless one of my friends pays for me"}
{"text":"The food has always been amazing since before they moved to this location and it continues to satisfy! Made fresh to order, the only downside is the wait time through the drive thru."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food I have ever eaten in Phoenix!!!! Will definitely be a repeat customer.  Can't comment on some of the other issues brought up by other reviewers, as I did not physically go into the restaurant myself. But the food..AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I only gave it 3 stars. We live right by Mexteca so a lot of times it's our go-to place for Mexican food. Lately we've been disappointed. I always order street tacos and they don't seem as fresh as they used to be. My husband gets the Mexican pizza and he can say the same.  The breakfast burritos seem like they've been pre made and warmed up...they used to be much fresher. This place isn't as busy as other competitors near by like Carambas, yet the wait to get your food is really long. The workers also don't seem as friendly anymore. I don't know if something has changed with management or if my husband and I are just tried of eating here. Prices are decent and decor inside is nice! Just not the best food anymore."}
{"text":"By far the best local Mexican food in AZ.  If you are thirsty they have a full service bar and happy hour from 3pm -7pm. They know how to hook you up. One of my favorite is the albondigas soup.  My family are fans of the carne asada."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy the meal. Parts were cold and very greasy. Tacos fell apart. Meat was tasteless and tough. Rice had no flavor. Beans were the only thing that tasted ok. We ended up throwing almost half of the meal out. Service was average, kind of felt that they were doing me a favor. They forgot one item, fortunately did not charge for it. Will not return here, many other choices available."}
{"text":"No pretense, but the very best cheese enchiladas in the valley!  I have been a patron for years now, eaten in all the old locations. The food remains the same, great!!   Red beef burrito are huge and filled with tender meat and a wonderful sauce.   Salsa bar, try the pickeled cucumbers. A family favorite. Prices are reasonable.  Huge bowls of albondigas soup or just beef and chunks of vegetables, delicious."}
{"text":"Mixteca was OK. Kind of a cross between Baja Fresh and Robertos. The quesadilla was decent and the beef tacos were good also, just nothing spectacular. I would go up the street to \"Carumbas\" for something better. Doesn't accept AMEX:("}
{"text":"Possibly our new spot! Great mexican food and a BAR!! With live music!! Cant beat it!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Friday evening meals at Mixteca for the last few years.  But their focus is now on Friday night partying and it doesn't seem as family friendly anymore.    I usually order three full meals for our family and have always been very pleased that the food is so hot, I have to put something under the bag on my lap.  But last night, the food wasn't even warm so it all had to be heated up.  That's not what I expected after waiting for 20 minutes for my to go order.  They have changed the red sauce recently so if you're looking for lunchroom cafeteria reddish sauce with no flavor, this is the place.    Although I have traditionally enjoyed their enchiladas, it isn't the same without the cheese being melted instead of just a yellow hunk.    Bottom line, this place isn't what it used to be.  I'll give it one more try on a breakfast burrito but it may be that they would rather be a bar than a restaurant."}
{"text":"I want to give more stars and really like this place.  Service was ok, carne asada tacos pretty good.  Price is cheap.  They have beer.  Nice layout and good location.   All great things but................The place is filthy.  If you can't or won't maintain the dining room and bathrooms then just imagine the kitchen.  We didn't catch them on a bad day either.  What a shame."}
{"text":"The best carne asada burrito ever! The tamales \"enchilada style\" melt in your mouth. So good and such quality!"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed mixteca on several occasions.  There is a bit of a line, but it is always worth the wait. Salsa bar and chips are awesome and I absolutely love their beef tacos."}
{"text":"Very fresh and delicious food.  I would recommend the Carne Asada burrito and the street tacos.  I occasionally get the Carnitas in the  tacos but it has been hit or miss lately.  The salsa they include with the meal is fantastic.  My wife loves the bean and cheese burritos.  Pro-tip:  If you are going through the drive thru bring a book, iPad or gaming device.  It is going to be a while but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best mexican in northwest valley.  Great fish tacos, my kids love the cheese crisps, grilled chicken burrito is awesome.  I am a frequent visitor and have yet to be dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Tonight we were let down, however I LOVE this place and want them to succeed.  Being in the food industry I know first hand the challenges that come day in and day out.  The food is awesome and I have never had anything bad.  Service and cleanliness needs major improvement however.  There are no check backs at the tables (that are clean) and the staff doesn't appear to be happy...no one is smiling!  Being in the industry and managing my own restaurant I know how important and influential these reviews can be.  Maybe they had an off day or something happened beyond their control...however, to sit in the drive through for 20+ minutes only to have one of the employees tell you they're closed at 8pm on a Sunday when the hours posted says 10pm is not acceptable.  Where's the loyalty to your guests?  Remember, with out us you're nothing more than \"remember that place?\".  4.5 stars for food and consistency  2 stars for service, cleanliness and doing what's right in your community  Hopefully this is taken to heart as a family of 4 who loves the food was seriously disappointed tonight for dinner!"}
{"text":"Patio service is HORRIBLE wait for drinks, wait forever for food, and wait to pay. Loved the band though..I've been there 3xs thinking waitress was having a bad day..every time same problem. Horrible service outside. You would think managers would pay attention."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in search for good Mexican food,  we ordered combination of taco, tamale and tostada and a Fajita for me. since v r vegetarian he substituted enchilada in place of tamale. Omg! That was the most horrible Enchilada v ever had. The cheese was gross and so sticky like bubblegum...eeeksssss..  I couldn't even choke it down. They offer free chips for Dine in and they taste weird the salsa was not flavorful. Needless to say, i am never going ther again."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty authentic and portions are way large. Prices justified. It's best to go after 1:30 on the weekends when the lunch crowd thins a bit. You can get Tex-Mex faves like chimichangas, or carne asada soft tacos. Overall it's worth the price. I agree it's great to dine outside when temp is below 100."}
{"text":"Carnitas burrito.  The. Best. In. Phoenix.    It's always fresh, moist, soft, and absolutely delicious.  Had it again Friday and i told my wife it was the best, freshest, tastiest burrito I've had in years.    Keep up the fast service and great food !"}
{"text":"Awful place that will delete your reviews if you do not commend them.I can not even give this place any stars! I went in Wednesday to see the remodels that have been done to patio and give it another try. Horrible service I sat at the bar only to be ignored, received a beer that was not even full, ordered food and received wrong food. Asked for a manager was informed by bartender she was the manger but she didn't even know how to do her job correctly. I used to go for the cruise in's and would stop for a beer once awhile, will not be returning. Will follow with Nancy for different locations cruise in's are held."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!  The food is excellent.  I would challenge you to find a better shredded beef taco anywhere in the valley!  The atmosphere was fun and in the parking lot was a car club show ( I hear they do car show every Friday and Saturday night).  Absolutely should be on your list of places to try!"}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten at this place a lot. It's usually pretty decent. But tonight our shredded beef tacos were literally sour. I thought it was just my taste buds so I tried to keep eating it. Then I realized the meat smelled putrid and had gone completely rotten. We called the manager, wasn't super helpful. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Picked up a beef fajita burrito at the drive thru. Long strips of \"meat\" that was mostly connective tissue and completely unchewable.  I've never had beef fajitas like this, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Drive thru takes a while. Dinning inside is a better experience."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Probably the best spot in North Glendale . The enchiladas are my favorite. The patio area is nice. We enjoy the chips and salsa bar, excellent salsa!  It is a fun place to hang out with the family and friends for an inexpensive dinner. Oh! The special margaritas are made with Patron. Can't go wrong with Patron and they are pretty inexpensive for top shelf .  TIP: local car owners display their cars in the adjacent parking lit on Fri night. Kinda cool to go walk and look at the cars. Safe, family friendly spot"}
{"text":"They charge more at the registers than on the menu.  If a taco is $2.75 ea. then at the registers they will charge an extra $.85 and lie through their teeth or hopefully you are too drunk to notice and say the taco costs $3.60 plus tax not the menu prices you see up on the board or on the paper menus.  A combo will cost up to $2.75 more at the registers, again they will deceive you with BS.  They've been doing this on and off between summer and spring for the past four years yet nobody notices the price differential on the board or paper menus and the registers.  They still have SLEAZY waitresses not servers who encourage patrons to buy more drinks.  I believe they have sex in the bathrooms during open mic nights, I saw a condom on the floor. Several years ago I remembered when they started out on 43rd Ave and north of Dunlap Ave they did the same thing, and neither the city, county, nor state did nothing.  This reminded me of another restaurant in Glendale who are still operating there after so many years.  Where is the common decency?!"}
{"text":"Great Little place for a quick bit to eat. Has a decently priced menu. The line moves quick and the salsa bar is all you can eat so two thumbs up."}
{"text":"If you like the open salsa bar concept, you'll love Mixteca. All the original flavors of any other local Mexican food restaurant, but with upgraded atmosphere and care from the owner and team in your experience. Convenient location- and available breakfast, lunch or dinner! Do yourself a favor and eat here before or after a visit to the mall or other Arrowhead attractions, or really any time you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Love the food. And they have a great happy hour. You will be pleased with the cleanliness and the staff are great."}
{"text":"Good, cheap Mexcian food covered in gooey cheese. Yum.  Nothing fancy but HUGE menu to choose from.  Also burgers with amazing fries for the non-adventurous children in our family.  Only issue is the soda machine only works 1/2 the time. Personal favorite- Chile Relleno and cheese enchilada combo."}
{"text":"Beyond amazing Mexican soups! Usually they run out by mid morning tho so you have to get it while it's hot. The service is on point as well, everyone is so friendly and helpful. I live 45 minutes away but every time I come out to visit my friend or in the area I have to stop here and get a soup. They have good Mexican food in general as well"}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito for the second day in a row. They are great!!!!!  I have been to Mixteca before this is my first review for it. I hate to beat a dead horse but I need a half star. Burrito was great but no better than the one I had yesterday at big burrito. The only difference was the ambiance is much nicer at Mixteca although the salsa isn't nearly as good. If big burrito was a nicer location I would rate it higher than Mixteca and vice versa if the food were better at Mixteca I would rate it higher. So as far as breakfast burros go it's a tie."}
{"text":"They never let you down!   The bacon, egg, and potato breakfast burrito is an eye opener... Which helps in the morning.  Carne Asada burrito it hands down awesomeness in a tortilla!  However, my favorite plate is (drum roll) the Chicken Chimi!!!!! Epic deliciousness, golden fried... Same color as the streets in heaven.   We will never stop coming here...  God bless you Mexteca!"}
{"text":"Very Slow.  The first time I visited, I went through the drive thru. There were a couple of cars ahead of me, and it took a while before I got to the speaker to order.  Then a while longer before I got to the window.  Then longer still before I got my food.  Over 20 minutes but the food was pretty good.  The second time, I decided to go inside and get my order to go.  This was a mistake.  The line was not moving very fast to take the orders, but the worst part was waiting for the food.  Someone would put an item in a tray on the counter and then go work on some other order.  After a while, someone would put something else in the tray, and so on.  The result was over 30 minutes from the time I placed my order until I received it, and most of it was soggy and falling apart and cold.  Luke warm would be a generous description.  To be fair, the beans were hot.  The food is basically the same as the 'bertos around town, but I won't be back due to the wait."}
{"text":"I was going to give 4 stars because it took 90 minutes from order until delivery but it was raining out and the food was so good that I gave 5 stars!! Good job!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Beer was ice cold. Love the frozen margaritas. Matilda was an excellent bartender. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a few years now and WOW how much work they have done to improve the restaurant! The patio looks amazing!! The food has always been amazing too! I always get the combo and shrimp cocktail and it never lets me down!! You get your chips and salsa after you order and they have a variety of salsa to choose from! I have so many good things to say about the restaurant that my review could keep going! AND they have a drive though!!"}
{"text":"So Mixteca was recommended to my wife from a co-worker. She described it as a neighborhood local go to place with really good food. We went and I agree, the food was delicious and large portions. Hope to visit again, maybe after a Cardinals game."}
{"text":"While the food here is pretty good, the customer service is lacking tremendously. Just went in today and ordered Two LUNCH combos @ 5.99. The lady charged us 7.99. I told her that we ordered the lunch menu combos and she said yes they are 7.99. Even though that is NOT what the drive up menu says. So I asked for a take out menu. Confirming the prices, I took the receipt and menu inside and told them what happened. The cashier proceeds to tell me that  I might have heard wrong but they'll fix it anyway. Then he says in order to get my what, $5 refund, that I need to go out to my car, get the food and they need to take out the extra amount because the lunch specials are smaller portions. Are you kidding me??? Any good service skills know that that is unacceptable. And you lost a returning customer."}
{"text":"Mixteca is a  Great Place  to get some drinks and good food. Everything is prepared by hand, nothing is Frozen or microwaved to eat. Bill the owner is on top of everything making sure everything runs smooth. The employees work hard and fast.  I forgot to order sour cream and the manager Hector fixed it for me no problem.  I Come here frequently and recommended it to  everybody."}
{"text":"It's filthy, the tables are rarely cleaned, and I've gotten sick every time I come here. Never again. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Decoration are very dusty.  Bathroom was not very clean.  After waiting for  1 hr for menudo, finally had enough of waiting.  Went to ask what was taking so long.  Informed that \"menudo was not ready\".  Checked their health department grade and they got a \"c\".  Will not be eating that menudo after all."}
{"text":"Came in for guacamole and margaritas.  Happened to swing in on a recommendation and was not disappointed. I have ridiculous standards and I was nothing less than impressed. Katie at the bar was wonderful and helpful, A.J the bartender was very impressive; precise in everything he made. Highly recommend, living in Chicago it's difficult to find good Mexican with good margaritas..... which were beyond amazing prepared very traditionally. Mixteca surpassed all expectations we will return."}
{"text":"LOVE MIXTECA!!!   We live very close to here and eat here regularly!!  The food is authentic and great!!  Both breakfast and lunch are well worth the wait.  The staff is friendly and the owner is very involved in the restaurant!    Only downfall is that the drive through is incredibly slow...much faster to go in.  :)"}
{"text":"I don't understand how anyone would consider this place decent. We should've left immediately after seeing the filthy condition the place was in, but stayed because we were desperate to find a decent Mexican restaurant and sometimes looks can be deceiving. After ordering our food we waited for our number to be called but apparently our ticket got looked over because we noticed about 10 people who ordered  after us were already eating their meals. Overall, the food was extremely bland and had no flavor whatsoever.   I wish I read the reviews before coming here, a lot of them are frightening. At least the meat we received wasn't rotten.. Definitely not going to take any further risks with this place.   Guess we'll have to keep looking."}
{"text":"Food is decent, nothing to rave about.  Worst thing is there salsa, it so thin, very hard to dip a chip in.  They have it set up as self serve chips and salsa, also some condiments.  Another downfall is the containers for the thin salsas is sooo small it's even more difficult to get any on the chips.  They have a full bar and nice patio areas to sit at.  They have servers, but you can order yourself at counter.  We started going recently because of the fun car show they host every Saturday night."}
{"text":"We went on cinco de mayo evening and had a great time. The DJ was awesome, played great dance music. I had the ceviche, so much shrimp, it was very good!"}
{"text":"The last few times I've been to this place I've come home only to have the wrong food. I don't live far from here thank God because if I did I would be extremely pissed. Not only do you have to wait at least 20 minutes in line but you get the wrong food. Then when something isn't up to your standards like the nachos my husband received that were soggy and all clumped together the manager yells at you. I asked for a refund and she told me to bring them back and they would give us new ones. Then they told us that they would be there until 10p and it was 9:50p so we said screw it because I didn't want to drive all the way back for them to not even open the door. The people that own this place have no customer appreciation. They literally do not care. The food is slowly going downhill but is still decent. The people that work here are the rudest employees and managers I've ever encountered."}
{"text":"Man haven't been here in at least five years but the food is still pretty good for a little drive-through Taco Shop love their monster tacos they're freaking huge and super feeling highly recommend them shredded beef was okay had a little of a almost sour taste to it Selangor was decent but pretty cheap still it beats them all the bertos all day long"}
{"text":"So hungry, stopped to get a breakfast burrito yesterday morning.  There is no \"ito\" about this!  It is huge.  I couldn't in any fashion finish it.  Wrapped it back up, microwaved for 100 seconds.  Now I sit here enjoying the leftovers!  Eggs, bacon and big chunks of potatoes!  YUMMY!  Plan on going back this weekend!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!   We happened to be in the area for an appt and decided to stop.   The staff was so helpful and friendly and my carne asada chimichanga was heavenly.   They have a chips and salsa bar which is a big hit.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We brought a friend here who was visiting from California. She loved it. This place is our go to place for Mexican food. We have been coming here for over 10 years, and you know what? It keeps getting better!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome.  Drinks were terrible. House margaritas were watery.  They use a low end mix.  Disappointing.  Could be a great hangout."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through and ordered 1 burrito and chips and salsa. Got home and realized I didnt have my burrito. I didnt have enough time to go back and come back home again, so I got ready for work, and then went back on my way to work. It had now been about 45 minutes since I was at the drive-thru. I walked inside this time, and explained what had happened. The girl didnt' seem to care. She grabbed a burrito that had been sitting in the corner by the drive thru for this whole time apparently. I was hoping for a fresh burrito to take to work, not an old one that had been sitting out. She said they could charge me for a new burrito. I said no thank you I will just take my money back for the one I never got. She did give it back but dropped my money on the counter with a little attitute. I guess it was my fault they forgot to put my burrito in the bag? Went across the street to Carambas to pick up lunch instead. Love Carambas!"}
{"text":"I am from So.Cal where there is plenty of great Mexican Restaurants!  This place is a gem! The food is awesome! Free chips in salsa bar!! Go it's great!"}
{"text":"What attracted me to this place was seeing the outdoor patio, every time I drove down Bell Rd. It was a beautiful afternoon/night  so I thought I would pop in for Happy Hour (not knowing if they had one or not). They have HH prices on select food and drinks all day.  I decided to order regular food instead of order off the HH menu.   First Impression: fast food, good chips and salsa bar, friendly service, good selection of bottled beers and draft beers.   Food: Carna Asada Burrito. Lots of meat. You could probably for go \"enchilada style\" and pour one of the (free) salsas over the top. Good flavor. I would definitely order it again.   Atmosphere: Indoor dining looked comfortable but choose outdoor patio. The fire strip table top was perfect for the quickly dropping temperature. Downside....country music blaring on the outdoor speakers. I asked a server if they always played \"country\". She said \"the DJ starts at 6:30 and plays a variety of music.\" So I guess I don't know if \"country\" is always played. I was also told they have DJ's and bands on the weekend.   I will be back to try other food selections."}
{"text":"Never coming here before, I was surprised that this place is basically like a fast food Mexican restaurant. It even has a drive thru. But lots of people have told me how good it was so I tried it anyway. I ordered their street taco special which is basically like two small carne or pollo asada tacos with beans and rice for $5.50. It was a great deal and really filling for the price! There are bottomless chips for dine in customers although the chips were slightly stale because they were sitting out for people to refill themselves. They had a salsa/condiment bar and I sampled all the different kinds they offered. They were all fresh and tasty! Overall, great quick spot for Mexican food in the area. Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I can't tell you how the food is here because the service is so bad we walked out! The women working the front counter couldn't figure out who should take our order so after walking back and forth we left. The place looks a little dirty inside so, I think we probably saved ourselves a case of food poisoning."}
{"text":"Amazing street tacos right up the street! Can't believe it's been there so long and I never tried it!"}
{"text":"The food is great but DO NOT go through the drive thru if you are in a hurry or don't have time to catch up on your reading.  Average time on  Friday or Saturday evening is at least 20-30 minutes. Most people turn off their engine and sit.  Go inside if you can find parking."}
{"text":"the wait was long, but that means the food was cooked fresh.  it was not bad.  a decent burrito.  something cheesy, greasy and hot was also ordered.  decent food, service was okay."}
{"text":"Expensive considering you get served in a foil plate and have to get your own food, chips and soda.  Red chili was awful and meat was dry. Cashier was not the friendliest person either"}
{"text":"I finally managed to try this place today after knowing about it for quite sometime!  Was pleasantly surprised for the most part.  I ordered three full size Carne Asada tacos, and they exceeded my expectations.  The star deduction is for too much guacamole on the tacos as well as it being what I think to be out of a bag and not authentic.  Tortillas were also average, but as a whole I was impressed and will be back!  The nice chip and salsa bar, and prompt service make up for the guacamole and tortillas!  I do believe I'll be back, as the casual set up, patio, beer choices, margaritas and above average food are worth going back for!"}
{"text":"Went to listen to a band play and grab a bite to eat. They were crowded so we grabbed the first open table. My drink was flat when she brought it out. Didn't really seem to phased her when I told her and said oh sorry and moved on to taking our order. After about 10 minutes she asked me if I wanted something different  to drink besides the flat soda. I stated I would. My food came out wrong but I was so hungry I just ate it anyways. It was soggy and nasty, I only ate half of it. Over all I was not really not impressed with the food nor the service."}
{"text":"I love the bean burritos and carne asada burritos here. Quick service and well prepared food."}
{"text":"I love their refried beans and they make tasty and large breakfast plates. Unfortunately, a lot of their other menu items (lunch/dinner) are lacking in flavor and you only get chips if you are dining in. Also, it takes them a long tome to fill drive thru orders so if you are in a hurry, you will want to find another drive thru for quick eats."}
{"text":"Winner every time! Best food, street tacos are fantastic! Salsa is out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"I have had many meals here over many years and have always been very pleased with everything.  I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone desiring good Mexican style food.  Thank you Mixteca for your efforts and the great job you do."}
{"text":"I order two orders of Fajitas with shrimp, chicken,& beef with beans and rice & extra Guacamole. $23.00 with tax.      I have to say the food was good but they do not give you hardly any beef, any chicken or any shrimp.    This is the second time this month I've been shorted.      Take a tip: Do not order take out from them. Go inside and order. You want end up hungry. It's a rip."}
{"text":"It was extremely noisy and congested inside and in line for the register. But we got our food fast and it was great! Getting to-go boxes was a bit of hassle because we had to go back to the counter for them, and as mentioned, it was a bit crazy in there. The person who got the to-go lids for me was a little rude but he was busy and I didn't take it personally. This place seemed very popular! It wasn't the best that we had two babies (because of how crowded it was) but it was good and we'll go again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Salsa bar, beer, margaritas and authentic tasty Mexican food. This place has the best ceviche tostadas. EVER. Hand down. The machaca  burritos are amazing too. The carne asada tacos are just ok. Not taco truck status, but still yummy. The guac kind of ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Dear Mixteca,  How I love thee.  Our relationship started so long ago when I was only 16, and you were located on 43rd and Olive.  How far we have come since my lovely high school days.  I am proud to see that you have decided to move closer to me, sweetheart.  I am happy that we can now share the delicious treats that you provide.  Oh how I love your seasoned beef; I crave no other than your lusciousness...your salsa sure does spice up our nights.  I couldn't be happier of the cheapness of our dates...AMAZING.  Thank you so much for giving me the flavor and freshness that I crave in my life.  I know our relationship will continue to go on strong.  Love Always, Rebecca"}
{"text":"Very greasy food. I ordered a carne asada burrito and my wife had a hard shell chicken tacos both were so greasy we threw them out and made something else for dinner.  Wont eat here again"}
{"text":"Worked at the Kmart across the parking lot... My coworkers got a burrito there, and found a bug in it!! Ewww!"}
{"text":"I had hotcakes but tasted the eggs with beef from my husband plate and liked his more. Cashier a bit rude and impatient but a decent spot. Bacon super salty."}
{"text":"Mixteca used to be our favorite place in Phoenix to eat. The atmosphere, the food, the service, all was spot on. I'm not sure what happened but some time back- about a year ago, maybe less, things began to decline. The regular crew we were used to seeing started to vanish but most importantly the incredible kitchen staff was replaced. You could very noticeably taste the difference, it was like eating at a completely different restaurant. The service seemed to drop off a bit as well.  We ate here regularly for years yet the owner never acknowledged us, which we always found kind of odd, yet people who came in for booze were regularly acknowledged like family. You can tell by a lot of the remodeling he did that he wanted the place to be more of a cantina and bar than a restaurant, when it used to be the reverse. Maybe that explains a bit as to what happened, but it truly is a shame.  The last few times we went in we kept forcing ourselves, yet the food just became more and more aweful. We spoke to some neighbors who also frequented and they agreed, unfortunately. The final straw came one day when we got what seemed like a bit of food poisoning that made us really sick. It's a shame indeed but Mixtecca is not the restaurant it once was."}
{"text":"I always find it reassuring when I pull up to a Mexican restaurant that there's a bunch of landscaping trucks parked and the guys are inside eating lunch :)  I thought Mixteca did a pretty good job with my carne asada tacos, rice and beans were not a complete afterthought, decent chips and salsa bar.  The staff was friendly (they actually SMILED). I was about to get a little p.o.'d when my taco platter and small Diet Coke was more than nine dollars but rest assured the portions are by no means skimpy.  The decor was typical fresh-Mex beach type, I could certainly see myself enjoying a cerveza on the large patio when the sub-100 degree days resume!"}
{"text":"I come here everyday to start by day but I won't anymore a kid thinking he's the shit running the drive thru ruined it for me. If you make a mistake on an order own up to it and tell that person my bad. Plus if you just started there and don't know the answer, go find someone who does and don't give a stupid answer like \"i only started 3 days ago soooo\" stupid this is shitty customer service"}
{"text":"I got the Carne Asada street tacos and my father got the mini-chimis. The chips and salsa was great and the food we ordered was so fresh and delicious! I'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"To start off with I ordered my food to eat n when I received it it was packed to go so I had to unpack to eat. I ordered a side of sour cream with my order and it was not there. In order to get the sour cream that they forgot in the first place I had to stand back in line and wait over 10 more minutes to get what I should have gotten in the beginning, needless to say by the time I stood in line and got my sour cream my lunch was cold. I won't be back and it's sad because I've been coming once a week with my family for the past few months. Next!"}
{"text":"Wow, I am surprised that I haven't reviewed this place yet. It's almost a weekend tradition. I'm partial to the carne asada street tacos. Three wee tacos with nicely marinated beef, cut into small pieces with lime and onion. Simple, good, tasty food!  The salsa and chips bar offers a fantastic assortment of fresh salsas, cilantro, Iimes, jalapenos, etc. Great food for any time of day."}
{"text":"I have two favorite things about Mixteca..oh make that three.  1) Breakfast burritos. I think their breakfast burritos are the best and I've tried a lot.  2) Salsa bar! 3) Drive through - because sometimes you don't feel like getting out of the car. :-)  I pretty much only get the breakfast burritos and chips & salsa. Everyone I've shared Mixteca with seems to like it too."}
{"text":"I am writing this as a very angry customer.  I have been to this place many times and love the food and atmosphere.  Yesterday on my way home went thru the drive thru (1st time ever) and it was difficult to understand the worker and we went back and forth about the order for too long.  I waited and the food came out at an acceptable time.  I did not check my order and went home. (about 7 miles away).  When I got home I discovered that we did not have our complete order.  All that was in the bag was the chips and salsa...NOT THE 2 burritos I ordered.  I was pretty mad because now I had to drive all the way back and get this corrected.  Driving over I calmed down and thought this may be my error for driving off too quickly.  I entered the dining room and waited my turn.  I told the cashier the issue (even said it may have been my fault)and suddenly the drive thru clerk appeared with the 2 burritos.  I told the cashier that I wanted them re-made because it had been about 30 minutes and I did not want cold food.  At this point the drive thru clerk started to argue with me and told me this was my fault.  I was not about to argue about who's fault this was, so I asked for a a full refund, and I would eat somewhere else  The drive thru clerk said some other things and walked away.  the cashier refunded my credit card transaction in cash.  A manager finally approached and told me that I should always ask for a manager if there is a problem, I told her I informed the cashier of the issue and her employee wanted to start an argument so I asked for a refund and wanted to be on my way.  The only thing she could say was \"would you like me to cook your food?\"  I said no and left.    My biggest issue with this whole situation is that NO EMPLOYEE EVER SAID SORRY.  I understand the mistakes get made, but to start an argument with a customer is not acceptable, and to not apologize for the error or your employees actions in unacceptable.    This experience will probably keep me from ever returning to this place"}
{"text":"Their shrimp tacos are amazing. Also Mexican pizza! We haven't found anything we didn't like. Very busy on weekends, but Monday night's are perfect."}
{"text":"It's hard to go wrong at Mixteca.  At first glance it may seem pricey, but the value is in the large portions and fresh ingredients.  Try the breakfast burrito!  Kudos to the friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food, Cafeteria Style! Lori at the Bar is Amazing. She whipped up a Special Coconut Rum n Syrup drink that was out of this world.  We all had various Sreet tacos versions and Fish tacos, 4 folks= $36, 2 Drink =$12. Yummmy"}
{"text":"Mixteca makes some dang good breakfast burritos!! I haven't had too much else there, but def worth trying out the breakfast burritos!"}
{"text":"Good food big portions reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my Girlfriend last weekend, as we ordered take-out for dinner.  All in all, its good fresh-tasting food.    Casual yet friendly decor with a Baja feeling about it.  Large selection on the menu even for picky eaters."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices! Truly fresh, authentic Mexican food @ it's best!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The burro I got was huge and the beans tasted fresh and homemade. The rice was pretty good as well. They also conveniently give you free chips if you dine in. The only bad thing was one of the people I was with ordered tacos and asked for one with carne asada in it but didn't get it. Other then that, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Excellent food; excellent price!  Took home leftovers for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"Eat here! I ordered the street tacos and they were authentic...I could actually envision getting the same plate somewhere in Mexico. It was delicious and cheap!   The ingredients seemed fresh. The serving was plentiful!  The service was fast and friendly. They were busy the entire time I was there and all the other customers seemed happy. There is a patio and it looks like they could host a pretty fun event out there, if needed. There are a couple of tvs so you can watch your favorite sporting event as well.  Keep it up, Mixteca! I'll be seeing you again on my next trip back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Place is not fancy,for sure,BUT the food is Fabulous for the price!!! When you see Ohoenix Firemen in there eating, You know the food is GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food place! I remember eating when I was a kid. But they were further south. I was excited when they came north. Family owned and it's great on Friday and Saturday nights with the live music."}
{"text":"My taco tasted just like KFC.  Mixteca somehow found out the Colonel's secret recipe and put it on the taco meat.  While it may actually sound kind of good, no, it wasn't.   The food wasn't very good overall, it was maybe good in the bland 'bertos-esque way that some people seem to like.  The food just wasn't cheap enough to explain away the bland and terrible taste of it.  For the two of us it was barely under $20 and we didn't even each get our own drink.   The highlight of the meal was the drink we shared.  We got a canteloupe/watermelon drink that was off the chain.  Saved themselves from a 1 star review with that gem. It was crowded and not friendly."}
{"text":"I would not waste my time on this place. Very mediocre food and really just about like a seat in Taco Bell. Really not worth going here with lots of other good choices within a 5 minute drive"}
{"text":"The most awesome Carne Asada fries available anywhere.  The best Mexican food I've had."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss.  On one hand the beans and rice are to die for (for me anyway) they taste exactly like a Mexican restaurant my Grandma used to take me to in California, so every time I taste them (I mix them together) it takes me back to those happy memories...on the other hand, I have actually gotten food poisoning from them in the past.  (Whole family did).  The inside is not clean at all, lots of dirt and flies everywhere.  Good food, but yucky inside.  I only do the drive through now, and I am okay with that."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and is usually serviced fast."}
{"text":"Breakfast over at 11. I ordered the chimi lunch special. I liked it! The salsa bar is plentiful and tasty. I liked them on the chips and chimis. Cheap. I paid like $6 for the chimi special (no drink though). Would probably come again. Better than Brush fire Tacos on thunderbird."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Food is very fresh staff is very friendly. Place is very clean and family owned."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a business breakfast. I had the Chilaquiles with scrambled eggs. It was great. It's not really on my side of town but I'd really like to go back and try some other dishes. Hefty portions at great prices. All four of us ate well for under $40 including drinks."}
{"text":"This place is gross. The food is not good at all.  My husband and I were in search for good Mexican food (and still are) good thing we only ordered one burrito I couldn't even choke it down"}
{"text":"Good food and selection. My husband and I eat here fairly regularly. I love their salsa and the atmosphere is great"}
{"text":"I went through the drive through for a breakfast burrito. They were pretty busy so it took about 15 minutes to get my food. It seemed a bit long, but I can handle it. After driving home, I realized I had been given a completely wrong burrito and chose to drive back to get my order corrected. As I waited at the register to talk to someone, SEVEN separate times, workers walked past the register, made eye contact with me, and continued with whatever they were doing. I get if you're busy and in the middle of something, but at least acknowledge you know I'm there and will be with me shortly. Having worked in a drive thru location before, I understand that entirely.   Finally someone greeted me at the register and without making eye contact with me, she asked what she could help me with. I informed her I got the incorrect order and finally she looked up at me. The individual who got my order on accident was actually behind me and gave his back to her as well. Within 5 minutes, he received his correct order and left. I was still waiting there for my order, just watching the kitchen to see if they were even making mine. Fifteen minutes go by and finally the manager, I assume, asked me what I was waiting for and ended up making my food for me.   Needless to say, I won't be coming back due to their blatant act of ignoring people because it was inconvenient to them at the time. To be genuinely honest, I felt I was treated differently because I wasn't of their ethnicity. That sucks, because I don't care about that. But to see them talk to other customers with eye contact and have more of a sense of urgency when they're the same ethnicity, and then not see it done with yourself...it's difficult not to think that it's due to your skin color. Too bad, because the breakfast burritos are great and I love them. But I won't be going back to an establishment who seems to treat individuals differently.   Thank you to the manager who actually recognized I was waiting for a while."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. My husband was feeling sick with a head cold and wanted soup in the middle of a hot summer night.  He chose \"Cocido\" a Mexican favorite soup. Yum yum!  I am I great cook however a very busy salon owner which means I'm too busy to make him his soup. I can truly say that the way they made this soup is Very,Very Authentic. The bones which I'm sure not every bowl gets one is what makes this broth full of flavor and all the vitamins needed for my sick husband. Thank you chefs for such a pleasure   This will be our new favorite spot"}
{"text":"This place has a little bit of everything! The red chili enchiladas are delicious. Beans are good/fresh. Shredded beef tacos are really juicy and crunchy. Chorizo burritos are perfect. Staff is friendly service is fast. Very clean every time I've visited."}
{"text":"From the outside, Mixteca looks like just about any other fast food Mexican joint in the Valley. Located in a somewhat run-down shopping center (Kmart is the anchor store. Yes, Kmart) on the corner of Bell and 67th Ave, Mixteca is a stand-alone restaurant with a drive -through lane that wraps around much of the building.   I was getting some work done on my car this morning at the nearby Jiffy Lube, and while walking around I saw their marquee sign, saying that they opened at 6:30am. I had some time to kill, so I went in.  Once on the inside, you can see right away that Mixteca is not like just another run-of-the-mill fast food place. The decor is sort of a \"Baja Beach\" theme with a big thatched-roof shack in the middle. It feels just little more refined - they did a nice job with the interior and I was admittedly impressed. There is a bar (yes, a bar. with beer and television sets) in one corner and outdoor dining for when the weather cooperates.  As far as the food goes, they have all the standard offerings. It was morning, so I opted for a ham breakfast burrito. Nice chunks of ham, potato and cheese rolled in a huge flour tortilla. If I had any complaint, it would have been that the potato wedges were a bit too big. On some bites, all I tasted was potato. IMHO, the perfect potatoes for breakfast burritos are of the shredded hash brown variety. Diced potatoes are ok. (At one place in San Diego, their potatoes were french fries. No, I didn't order a California burrito. But I digress....) These chunks were too big. In their defense, I did order the burrito without eggs (who does that??) so perhaps they were just trying to make up for the lack of huevos by overstuffing it with papas. Oh well. I still ate the whole thing.   Oh, I have to mention - they have a great salsa bar with different types of salsas (and free chips!!) carrots, cucumbers, and onions. Great stuff.  All in all, I was impressed with Mixteca. I look forward to seeing what their lunch and dinner offerings are like!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  The machaca plate is awesome!  Gets busy on Sundays but so worth it.  Great for dinner too.  Lots of options on the menu and everything is cheap.  Huge portions we always end up taking leftovers home.  Get the watermelon or limeade drink too, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"After waiting in the drive thru for about a half an hour with only three cars ahead of us, came home to open the bag with someone else's order... Fail!"}
{"text":"This place is all about the patio, The food is above average  but the Mexican Shrimp Cocktail is the bomb!   If you want a laid back place for beers and Margaritas this is it.  Live music on the weekends, the owner let us have a cancer fund raiser there a couple years ago and we are grateful....JJ"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on Cinco de Mayo, hoping to get some decent Mexican Food for lunch. Upon arrival and walking thru the front day I quickly became concern with the overall cleanliness of the restaurant. Once we ordered we got chips and Salsa.... (Chip and salsa bar was not well taken care of and the chip holder had very little chips in it and chips and salsa were all over front counter and floor. I could expect this if the place was slammed how ever it was minutes before noon and they were only a 1/4 full. I ordered a carne asada burrito and I was very disappointed. The burrito was basically beans and very little meat. Not what anyone should expect from a carne asada burrito in Arizona. My daughter ordered a taco and the grease was repulsive! We eat and left and the rest of the day was alla bout trying to digest awful food! Never again!"}
{"text":"This is great Mexican Food sit down or drive-thru. Lori the bar keeper is friendly and a real people person. Service is quick and you can have unlimited chips and salsa at the chip bar.  There is a outside patio that projects a comfortable and warming appeal. Don't expect intimate. This is a high paced restaurant. It is counter service with a great dining room. Not that cafeteria style like many. Come check it out! Family owned and operated by Sunnysloper's. #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by an ex and I have to say it's the nicest thing she ever did for me. The menu here is about what you would expect from Mexican fast food but the quality and taste of their food is consistently above most places you will find in the valley even including full service restaurants. The complimentary chips and full salsa bar are nice and if you go in the afternoon they have their liquor license."}
{"text":"I have yet to find a decent little Mexican food joint in the area. Sometimes you just want awesome neighborhood Mexican take out. This is not the spot. I've been here many times because of convenience and today I promised myself I wouldn't go back. Bland food, rolled tacos were soggy in the middle, regular tacos and even the salsa just are not flavorful. You'd expect more in AZ. I wish there was one of those Berto cousins close by.."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today since I was having a craving for some rolled tacos. I found out this was a bad idea. I ordered the guacamole rolled tacos with lettuce and cheese, and a hard chicken taco. The chicken taco was good, the rolled tacos were not. The meat inside the rolled tacos appeared to be a meat blend which reminded me of pink slime. It was discusting! I spit it out and lost my appetite when I did. If you go I would recommend that you stay away from the rolled tacos. p.s. I also forgot to mention that the drive-thru sevice was so slow, I almost waited 15 mins for my food at the window."}
{"text":"Just OK. The staff was not friendly at all. The Carne Asada does have flavor, but they drown the chile relleno in sauce & cheese when you get the combo plate. I've never had a chile relleno with sauce. I couldn't even taste the chile with all that goo on it.  If a Mexican place does not have great beans, it shows that they do not take pride in their food. Mixteca's beans were blah! The salsa bar was a mess when we got there, and the bar lacks flare."}
{"text":"The customer service is bomb so friendly and bubbly! Lady at the drive through was so friendly and nice I totally enjoyed my experience today!!! You guys have the best fast footless Mexican food hands down!!! My favorite ñ!"}
{"text":"This place is a Dump and so dirty  start out with the chips  everybody hands on the chips and kids diging in with hands :P  that little scooper just doesnt cut it ..The owner or lady who works their  she starts with picking up the big dirty matt  on floor by ice tea drink also dirty rag sitting on side of ice tea  drinks and coke machines then with her bare hands she goes to ice tea tanks and puts them in placer then goes and washes down tables with dirty water then comes back put in napkins in holder and then messes with sauce cups and lids for drinks all from the start of that matt on floor she did not wash her hands. The Food was ok nothing i would write home abt .. I dont care how cheap the food is .. wold not go back their again ."}
{"text":"I had a tongue burrito (listed under Torta on the menu) today. It was awesome!"}
{"text":"When you wait 20 minutes in the drive through and get the wrong order it sucks. I ordered a #16 and got the totally wrong order. What's the point of drive 8 miles back the opposite direct. The chicken enchiladas sure don't taste like the cheese and a chilli relleno was what I wanted."}
{"text":"Refuse to eat here.  Went there with 2 co-workers for the first time and asked what kind of Breakfast burritos they had.  After a sarcastic look and a big sigh she simply points at the menu board and says are you serious?  I look at this mess of a board to see where they are.  As I am looking (30 seconds no joke) she tells me \"whenever you decide what you want, tell me\".  She walks away angrily and goes back to the drive thru.  We were the only customers in the lobby maybe 2 cars in the drive thru.  I wait 5mins for her to come back and place an order.  I waited 15 to 20 mins for 3 basic breakfast burritos.    It was over $3 per and it was no better than filibertos.  The lady was extremely rude as if her customers inconvenience her establishment.   The food was average at best (3 stars).  I'd rather not bother ever going back to that place due to her attitude (1star).  I'll make the drive to Carolinas and get really good food at better prices with great service."}
{"text":"I've had enough with the incorrect orders here.  Today was the last time.  In the last 4 orders they have added guac every time, even when asked not to.   This time I specifically asked the cashier to ask the cook. I heard her ask, I asked her to be sure out was ok before I started to eat it.  It looked good until I picked up the mini chimi... they had wiped the guac off and flipped the chimi over.    The owner was there,  apologized, refunded the money and had a medical emergency to attend to.  Tired of wasting my time here. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area.  My family will be pissed.... another good restaurant down the tubes because of crappy employees."}
{"text":"Fun Saturday night music venue with good food & beer for only a few $. The music is fun and tunes everyone knows. The 1$ carne asada tacos are straightforward; meat, cilantro, onion, grilled jalepeño - delicious! Saw some lucious burgers being served. Will have to try one next time.  Will definitely be back!  As with any outside venue, as a non-smoking asthmatic I appreciate adherence to the 50ft from door rule. I'm sure other non-poluters would appreciate as well. As seems to be the norm, smokers only care about smoking. I can appreciate that its an addiction, but think of others occasionally please."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this place for over a year now. Taco Tuesday is always steady, the crowd is always good, the food is fantastic, and Lorie (the bartender) is awesome and always on top of it."}
{"text":"Good food, relaxed environment,  fresh chips and an amazing salsa/condiment bar! Prices are decent and the place is kept clean."}
{"text":"We go here for breakfast or lunch every couple of months. It opens pretty early, so that's a plus. Food isn't the best in the valley, but it's decent and priced well for amount you get. Breakfast burritos are good. Salsa bar is okay, though I find their red salsa tastes kind of like garlic powder. The others are okay. It can get a little warm inside the restaurant sometimes. Very casual with TVs towards the back, usually showing sports.  Counter service. Self-serve soft-drinks and self-serve chips if you dine in. I haven't encountered any rude people like in other reviews. Service at register has been fine for us. A-OK."}
{"text":"Mexteca, while not known for their breakfast menu, has quite the selection of breakfast burritos and other breakfast items including pancakes with eggs and bacon. I opted to go with the pancakes meal, having had a breakfast burrito the day before. I was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. The eggs were delicious and the bacon was even better. The pancakes themselves were okay hence the three star rating.  The staff was friendly and the dining area was clean and well maintained. I would definitely recommend Mexteca, but I would suggest sticking with the breakfast burritos in the morning.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great Carnitas!  I had my wisdom teeth pulled and I had my wife stop here to get me a Carnitas burrito for the first solid food I could eat. I ate it cold and cut it into thin slices so I could shove it in the mouth I could barely open. It was worth the pain.  Their salsa bar is really good, a lot of different varieties to choose from.  Good for breakfast too, they have breakfast burritos and my favorite there is the chiliquiles.  They also offer menudo on weekends, I always go for the red, but I think they have white too. If I remember right I think you can bring your own pot for them to fill to take home.  I can't believe I drove past this place for so long before trying it. Don't wait, it's worth the stop."}
{"text":"I was brought here by a fellow Yepler.  I had to order the breakfast burrito and I went with the machaca.  The cashier was super friendly and offered to let me try the machaca before I ordered it which was nice.    The place was orderly and the atmosphere was cool.  It was completely different from your  typical \"bertos\" restaurant.  I bellied up to the salsa bar which was well stocked with a variety of salsas and other stuff.  What turned me off was the super thick layer of dust that accumulated on the top of the sneeze guard around the string of fake red chilies they were using as decoration.  I could just imagine the dust falling into the salsas and chips.  I usually look right past minor cleanliness issues but this was very obvious and in a bad location, right at eye level.    The burrito was a good size, actually enough for two average eaters to split.  The eggs were well cooked and I enjoyed them using real potatoes rather than French fries in the burrito.  Pretty basic flavors for a machaca breakfast burrito.  It was well done but not outstanding.    I can see how the bar and nightlife would be a way to attract business in the evening.  I would return but wouldn't go out of my way for basic Mexican food.    All in all it was a positive experience."}
{"text":"There mini chimi lunch plate is the best! They also have really good breakfast burritos if you're going for breakfast! There red salsa is one that I would highly recommend it's not spicy but it has an amazing flavor too! I would recommend to go there!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for a pm snack , end up with dinner and I have to say YUM YUM ! The carne Asada flavor was Awesome !!! Definitely will try this place again for some dinner and maybe drinks."}
{"text":"Being from Texas i'm not a fan of AZ \"mexican\" food, or I guess just have had to get used to the way they do it here, This place is ok, I have yet to try more dishes, I was afraid to try it so I ordered the burger and fries, they are great, ordered some of the rolled tacos and they are good for the price, my sister has had the street tacos with different meats and she likes them all. So I'd have to say as far as Phoenix goes this is one of the better places. One thing I would change is the pushy cashier, wow! If you don't know exactly what you want get to the back of the line. It's like soup Nazi on the Seinfeld episode. Geez! Robotic and pushy. Both times it's been this way. Nice enough lady but take a chill pill."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. Ordered at the counter and the guy who took my order was rude and not helpful. Then I waited 20 minutes for my food and was really disappointed with it. We had a carne asada burrito combo plate and an a la carte chile relleno. Everything was lacking flavor and I would highly recommend going somewhere else for fast Mexican food."}
{"text":"First time being here...love the outdoor experience... the dj was playing some good music for a friday night, food was great and the owner hand delivered our food too us can't ask for better service and we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"If you like good drinks, beer and great food this is the place to visit on Saturday nights.  Remember it is no frills and the food comes on paper plates.  Live entertainment on the patio which seems to start out Meh but gets better with every beer LOL. Before or after eating you can visit the car show in the parking lot - usually a few hundred cars (Saturday night)"}
{"text":"Last time I will ever come to this restaurant. The drive in  wait is ridiculous. On 15 minutes for a watermelon drink. Guy ahead of me left without paying or food. My drink was sticky on the outside and overflowing. . Staff inside could be seen laughing and drinking soda. Done"}
{"text":"Cheap drive through Mexican, and it is delicious. Me and my buddy got a 2 chicken taco combo and tostadas and a chicken chimichanga meal, then since I am a fat kid at heat decided that we should eat it all in the car.. Probably not the best idea since some of it spilled.. Regardless amazingly delicious food at a super cheap price that can't be beat. Oh and they make it all fresh and are very nice at the drive through window. Although the one downside is that the chimichanga was a tiny bit soggy on the bottom; but regardless all the other items are great, but the best is crispy shell tacos. Best part of the whole meal? The bill was $20.00!!"}
{"text":"This pains me to give mixteca one star since I love their food and have frequented this place for many years and recommend it to friends verbally all the time but never again.  My mother just called me extremely upset, (I told her to go here to grab dinner) let me know that after she had been waiting literally 45 minutes in the drive through line with my 12 year old niece for a quesadilla she got to the window and wanted to complain. She truly wanted to get out of line but that wasn't an option with other cars behind her, she was locked in. The owner didn't care about her complaint or the wait, she asked for his contact info and he said he didn't need to give her anything, he's owned the place 28 years, my mother asked for chips, the lady at the window said she would get my mom some and he told the woman not to give her any chips.  That's a small business owner?! Wtf? Him treating one customer like they don't matter is not right. How disrespectful. Sorry your kitchen is running slow, be a true business owner and send a staff member out to each car, apologize, offer free chips just like you do inside. Do something. It cost you nothing and goes along way. Now, instead of promoting this small business, I will tell everyone I know about the shithead owner that disrespected my senior citizen mother with her granddaughter in the car after they waited 45 minutes in his drive through."}
{"text":"First of all, staff is obnoxious - cashier was nice but the lady calling the numbers and expediting the food was RUDE. Atmosphere is loud and chaotic; however, it was a Friday night. I had 3 item combo and not impressed with my food. My son had a carne  asada  burrito- the meat was bland and chewy-it was not edible- he took 2 notes and we threw it away. Because it was chaotic- I decided not complain but just ordered a bean and cheese burrito- it took well over 15min to get it. My daughter had a 2 item combo-enchilada and taco- she liked it. I would give the food a 2.5 and service and atmosphere 1"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Mixteca with a large group of friends for dinner. While the layout was a bit funky, the most important part (the food) was outstanding. I ordered the Carne Asada burrito and it was cooked just perfectly. It was filling and tasty. The chips and salsa were good, too. If you're looking for a good Mexican food spot without going to the normal chains, give Mixteca a try."}
{"text":"We go here often for the bean and cheese burritos. It's close to home and the best in the neighborhood for fast Mexican food. Inside they have a free chip and salsa bar with different sauces to choose from. They have live music on the weekends that play outside on the patio for those interested in that. They also have a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Was a little shocked when I saw they delivered. So I called to confirm and the very rude little girl answers the phone and when asked about delivery she says \"no, but the mailman delivers\" at 7:30 in the morning and having a very large office to order food for. They just lost a lot of money. Guess I'm gonna have to go for the basic catering. Was a normal customer, will not be going back ever again"}
{"text":"This would've been a 5 start review but they discontinued my family's favorite thing to eat at Mixteca.  We would go here for their street hot dogs and we went here last Saturday with a big group just to find out they discontinued them! Disappointment.  We all ordered Tacos and burritos which were still really good just not what we've come to love about this place."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now, once for breakfast and once for dinner.  The food here is just okay, in my opinion.  It is good for when I'm in a crunch and craving Mexican food and need a quick, convenient spot to chow down at.  However, there are definitely way better Mexican dining options out there.  I had the chorizo, egg, and papa breakfast burrito most recently when I visited here.  It is huge!  Definitely big enough to split between two people, and good portion size for the price."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. I know the owner and his family. Great food and cold beer always. The street tacos are amazing along with the mixed burrito!"}
{"text":"So excited!! We just moved here and for the first couple months I did not think there was a Mexican food restaurant near by.  This place is awesome!! Has a drive thru, which in it self is great, but the food is super yummy and very fresh and you get a lot for a fair price.  Can't wait to go on a Friday or Saturday after it cools off to see the live entertainment on the patio."}
{"text":"The street tacos here are bomb. For a fast food type of place the wait can sometimes be a little long. Numbers are called as the food comes up not in order. But guess if they are that busy that says something. All you can eat chips for dine in is a plus also. The wife likes it here also. Which is a plus for me. I could have some type of Mexican food everyday her not so much. Good place to try if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Spent 20 mins in the drive-thru waiting to get my food. Absolutely ridiculous .  Wont be coming back"}
{"text":"If you like typical Mexican food, I don't see how you wouldn't be able to like this place. The food is great (again, TYPICAL Mexican food, here), but what makes this place even better is that it has beautiful outdoor seating where you can eat. It really made it a nice experience. Furthermore, they have a nice bar that goes both indoor and outdoor. It's very welcoming. Supposedly, they also have live music on some weekends. The place, really, is worth going to and trying out."}
{"text":"Mixteca is a cool little Mexican shop in the Glendale area. On Friday and Saturday nights they have a car show in the parking lot and music, sometimes even bands out there. It's really cool.   As for the actual food here, I've only ordered breakfast burritos which are the bomb. Literally speaking, they can be a gut bomb but that not is always a bad thing. I recently ordered a bacon, cheese, egg, potato burrito and it was excellent, just really hard to finish, so think about sharing? I have had better breakfast burritos in my life, but I've had a lot worse, and this one is was far from the worse.  I wish I could give a half star here to make it 3 1/2 stars for the carswhows at least!  Anyways this is a good local hangout with decent food."}
{"text":"Mixteca is my favorite fast food Mexican joint.  I usually go here for breakfast and the inside is really nice and it doesn't have an odor like most Filberto's or Rolbertos or Berthabertos, ha ha.  Anyway, I usually get the chorizo plate or chiquilitas plate or breakfast burrito.  The food is always so tasty and the chorizo is never runny, the beans are creamy  and the flour tortillas are pretty good too but not homemade.  The food always comes out in a ceramic dinner plate, not some paper plate and the chips and salsa are to die for.  The hot sauce has a hint of garlic and cilantro (my mouth is watering just describing it).  They have really cool melon and watermelon drinks that my kids love.  My wife always gets a egg, cheese, & pico burrito.  I have not been here yet for dinner but I am sure it is just as good as the breakfast, you can tell the owners put there heart in this place because it really shows."}
{"text":"It's been quite awhile since I had been here, it's never been a go to spot for me but at 6am not much choices for breakfast burritos. I have never ordered a chorizo burrito here until now. Definitely different, I've never had a chorizo burrito that way. It really seemed to be ground beef with hot sauce over it.. Idk maybe I'm wrong, honestly wouldn't order that ever again. The staff was friendly, place was clean, I'm just not big on the food.. I can't say I'd never come back because it's sometimes convenient, it's just not my first choice."}
{"text":"The lady wasn't rude but wasn't friendly who took my take out order and met me at the register with a \"Give me a few minutes\". Not hello or anything. Then I didn't get my flour tortilla with my chilaquiles and the beans were oily and cold. There were cooked long pieces of onion which I have never had in chilaquiles, so that was off putting and the red sauce tasted more like the red salsa (tomatoey) rather than red peppery like the expected red enchilada sauce I expected to taste in this breakfast classic. The potatoes were also bland. Overall just a fast food joint meant for us gringos who don't know better. Unfortunately, if you're like me, you know better and this place just seems lazy. How you not gonna put cheese on those tortillas and that egg over hard was runny! Ugh."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the outside seating area and most of all the live music on the weekend paired with the car show out in the parking lot. Prices are good and you have a self serve chips and salsa bar where you can really get filled up on. I had the chicken fajitas which were good not excellent but, the price made them well worth it."}
{"text":"STELLAR! They even have healthy options.  Had a steak burrito on a whole wheat tortilla. Totally loaded with veggies and steak. I love the salsa bar, in my opinion if the chips and salsa suck I will pass on everything else. Looking forward to a return visit soon. Stoked on what they are doing on the patio."}
{"text":"Just a short update, the mean woman is gone!    The food is still wonderful and we still eat there almost every Sunday (and sometimes during the week also!)  Even though our eating habits have changed, we still love coming to Mixteca and they are very accommodating for us.    Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Mixteca food was tasty. My wife and I came here for the first time for lunch and the specials were very reasonably priced and served promptly. They have a good variety of salsas which is a plus. We will definitely be frequenting this place for lunch."}
{"text":"I never review places, but this was my first time visiting. We got a coupon in the mail for BOGO breakfast burrito. I order and pull up to the window, and hand over my coupon and card to the lady. She looks at me seemingly disgusted and says \"You know you have to tell me about this while you order, don't you?\" in a very condescending  tone. I expressed that this was my first time here and it doesn't state that anywhere on the coupon. She then rolls her eyes at me in a very sarcastic matter and says \"well now we are just going to have to redo this whole thing.\" She was pissed. She then asks in a very rude manner, \"do you have cash because our credit card machine isn't working\". I say no I don't. A few minutes goes by and she goes \"this is going to take a good 15-20 minutes to do.\"   I was basically begging this place to take my money, whereas any normal person would have drove off after the drastic eye roll right in front of your face. But she refused and continued to be rude to me.   Unfortunately I can't say much for the food as I never got my food, but the service was despicable. No customer should ever be treated so horribly."}
{"text":"Being a little spoiled and having access to amazing home made Mexican food I will say this place is Better than Taco Bell and On the Border. Overall the food isn't half bad. When I'm looking for a quick Mexican joint I would come back here. Service was quick and the food was hot. Unsure why the different combos IE the two and three item combos have such a limited selection but overall the one item combo was more than enough to fill you up."}
{"text":"This is a nice casual mexican fast food/dine in restaurant.  When you first walk in theres a counter to place your order, your then given an order number and seat yourself. We came here on a thursday night and to my surprise they were pretty busy, with a live band outside( descent music) the other diners seemed to be having a good time  which is an automatic bonus, people by nature thrive on other people's vibes. One of my favorite things here is they have a self serve chip and  salsa bar that was well maintained visually and for the most part seems cleanly, the salsa is really good and taste very fresh they also have toppings like onions, pico, lemons, cilantro and  cucumbers all fresh! Which I applaud.. we munched on the unlimited chips and salsa for awhile the wait was a little longer then I would have expected,  but I was in no hurry and was just enjoying the company of my family. We eventually got our food I split a combo meal with my partner  that came with a taco, tostada, tamale, and rice and beans. And ordered a kids hamburger with fries for the kids. This place has very large portions so its cost effective for the family 16.98 $ fed my family of four and we were pleasantly stuffed. And im a gal that can put it down im by no means a rabbit. So when I say large portions I do mean it. The only thing I could suggest for the restaurant is the rice is very disappointing to me and bland, im a pretty hard critic when it comes to spanish rice, because I make a killer Spanish rice I grew up on. The other thing I wasnt to pleased with , I did not like the fact that a few of the staff were chasing eachother around the restaurant and one almost ran my 6 year old daughter over.  There is a time and place for rough play and on the clock should not be one of those times. Overall opinion is pretty tasty and affordable. . I will most definitely come back for the food ."}
{"text":"Love this place I have been going here for years since the location was on 43rd and Olive ! The food has always been yummy and consistent . Life time customer  if  I could I would eat there every night of the week !!!"}
{"text":"First off, the lady at the cash register was rude. Second, rushed me to order. Hence, my first time there.. then I order a breakfasts burrito with avocado... and she decides to put in on the side... like if that makes sense?.. wrapped in aluminum foil.. and not even a fair amount of avocado for the price. Won't come back again. Burrito is mediocre. Better off at jack in the box."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Mixteca! I have been going for years, even back when they were on 43rd Ave and Peoria. The breakfast burritos with some green sauce are BOMB! Another favorite is the #5 with shredded beef tacos! I love their chips and salsa too!!"}
{"text":"moving here from Chicago I wanted to try the Mexican restaurant my family also from Chicago told me about this place   so I ordered a delicious dish I was surprised  like where I live now surprise is it worth the drive you bet"}
{"text":"Carne asada is alright, but you've gotta put more effort into your food than handfuls of shredded cheese on most menu items. On my second visit, I opted for the green chile burrito...the tortilla was nothing special, and the chile was bland. You call THAT a green sauce?  As the green, gravy like mixture spilled everywhere, I tried to enjoy it with some tortilla chips. Their chips aren't anything special either. I like the salsa bar and the atmosphere, but when it comes to a quick Mexican dining experience, I know you can do tons better. I don't hate this place, but the bar is set higher in the desert."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! The only bad thing is the staff. They just seem very rude and aren't very informative BUT THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS!!! You get alot for the price you pay!"}
{"text":"Found this place on a fluke after stopping at Living Spaces.  Ordered the 'healthy option' steak burrito.  When I got back to work, I saw that they'd given me chicken, but I honestly wasn't very disappointed.  For $6.00, this is a big burrito packed with FRESH bell peppers, onion and black beans.  The chicken was moist and did not taste frozen or prepackaged.  The spice was perfect (I'm a total wimp when it comes to spicy food) and the flavoring was fantastic.  Sure, it's 'fast food', but for the amount of food and the quality, this is a definite find."}
{"text":"This place has something for everyone, while not a sit down restaurant , the food is super delicious and authentic. Coming from out of state it took us a while to find our kinda Mexican food, this place has it from shredded beef and street tacos to shrimp burritos and the red sauce for the enchiladas they do it all perfectly. Try the Mixteca  omlette for breakfast only if your really hungry and live music , full waitress service and relaxing ambience and cold beer on the patio perfect to relax after long week on fri- Sunday nights."}
{"text":"The food was alright, pretty greasy, workers are rude and don't seem happy to be here. The ice machine wasn't working so we told a worker and she rolled her eyes and said \"okay\" and when you asked for some fries on the side they got irritated and rude."}
{"text":"I LOVE Mixteca! It's casual dining and delicious!  Place your order, then grab a table and wait for your order to be called out by the number on your receipt.   There is a help-yourself chips and salsa bar - totally delicious! Different salsas available. Only thing I find gross is when the tongs are just laying in the pile of chips. I try not to think about how many dirty hands have handled the tongs now laying in the food. I just grab from the back like I do at a buffet.  The food is really good! Reasonable prices! Friendly cashier! Clean restrooms! They also have someone who maintains the dining area by keeping it clean and tidy.  I've been there at lunchtime and during dinner on a Friday, which was busy. I think there was a DJ setting up. There is a bar area too.  Yum! I crave Mixteca!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! I got the street tacos and my boyfriend got the ceviche boat and both were very very good!!!! Rebecca was our waitress and was above excellent! I would recommend this place to everyone! Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Found a new place for street tacos!   I drive past this place quite a bit and I always wanted to stop in... Well I did and it was great!    Street Taco Special was $3.99  (03-01-10)   Two tacos with two flour tortillas each, lots of meat and topped with cilantro and onions.  Plus the rice and beans.  Great deal and a perfect dinner!  Reminds me of Rocky Point!  Beers are pricey.. $4 but the cheap food made up for that!"}
{"text":"This place is so legit! Where to even start... Umm top 3 best carne asada burritos I have had. My fave used to be Carolinas... not anymore. Owner is almost always there and is nice as can be. Awesome coronaritas. Super casual grab your own drinks and chips inside.. if you want a server on the weekends outside you can get that too. Their ala carte tacos are bomb... as well as their wraps! love love love this place! be ware on Friday and Saturday they are busy busy busy with the car show that is going on at night..but don't stray its a ton of fun!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by on the way home for lunch today.  I ordered the carne asada burrito, which I've had before and thought was great.  My wife ordered the beef torta.  We got home and ate.  The burrito tasted great.  My wife ate half her torta and though it was decent. She saved the other half to eat later.  While eating the other half of her torta, she felt something strange after the bite she took.  She took out the food and opened up the torta to find the sticker on the tomato slices still stuck on there, (I'll upload the picture).  I don't think we will be by again.  It's unfortunate, because I thought their burritos were pretty good."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, classic Mexican food. Killer happy hour deals, especially on drinks. Their normal DJ (Shane V.) was very very sub par. My group tipped him three times to request a song, as he recommended we do, and he didn't play any of it. Killed the vibe for sure and we left earlier than planned. Get a new DJ and we'll be back to party longer!!!"}
{"text":"I stop in here for street tacos and beer. Been coming here for 5 or 6 years. It's veey cheap but a much better environment than Filly B's."}
{"text":"My family usually loves this place. MY GF and I pick up stuff from here and take it to my Parents' house and everyone usually enjoys it. Not this time. The other day my Dad wanted Mex, so I called them up and ordered a couple of combo plates. Taco combo, enchilada combo. Picked it up about 15 minutes later like they said (it hadn't been bagged yet), so that took a few minutes...then drove 4 blocks to their house. Enchiladas were cold (it was 105 outside) and the tacos crumbled into pieces upon first bite. Neither of them enjoyed their lunch that they just paid around $18 for. Maybe someone in the kitchen was having a bad day."}
{"text":"I love street tacos. They are so yummy. This was the first place I tried them at. My guy told me to order mine on corn tortillas instead of flour and I'm glad I listened. We went through the drive thru and they were not very fast but I didn't mind because I wanted my food to be fresh. The employee at the window was polite. The tacos seemed a little pricey for how small they were but I am addicted so I most likely will be back!"}
{"text":"I like this place! I have been eating Mixteca for over 30 years!! I remember the very first day that Billy opened his restaurant at 43rd Avenue and McDowell. I was there that first day! I remember his personal struggles, being so young and taking on all of the responsibilities of opening his very own restaurant!   So...Fast forward 30 years, and he has been quite successful!! The restaurant is unique and very busy (the line is sometimes out the door at lunch)! Billy really puts his heart and soul into his business! He wants to be more than just a restaurant. He provides regular entertainment, and even a Saturday night car show in the adjacent huge parking lot that not too long ago was a parking lot for K Mart! Check out the website to see who is scheduled to entertain and get ready to boogie! Oh ya, lots of alcoholic choices available!  I like the lunch specials, which are a great value. Heck, I like all of the food! They have really good shredded beef tacos!! I like the chip and salsa bar too! I only wish I was 30 years younger and eating at the original location!! :("}
{"text":"Went there tonight.  My wife ordered the fajitas and I ordered a 3 item combo.  The fajitas were good.  My 3 item combo was lackluster.  The chicken taco had a weird taste, and the tamale had enchilada sauce on it.  All items were very bland and we had to add salt.  The beans and rice on the other hand were amazing.  The service was typical counter food.  The tables were clean.  The TVs were annoying - luckily there was no volume, so it was bearable."}
{"text":"Breakfast fan. Huge portions and consistent delicious food. Nice salsa bar and patio. I go here as a reward to myself."}
{"text":"Lives up to the Phoenician reputation for bomb-diggity Mexican drive thru's.  Breakfast burros that give you that \"Ima be full all day, guey\" feeling... on the cheap. Ya know. Yumm!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a long time but I live in awatukee reason being not to mention the other location near olive was closed quite some time back. Great service and food"}
{"text":"My family usually ends up here once a week and enjoys good service and great food. Today, Labor Day, not so much. The woman working the register about 10:30am totally killed our vibe by being abrupt, borderline rude and just giving off the feeling she didn't want to be there. If I didn't have a hungry kid with me who didn't have his heart set on his bean burrito, she was enough to make me walk out. Lady, I don't know what you are going through but check yourself before you kill this business. Additionally register lady, you got our order wrong."}
{"text":"This is very clean and friendly place to eat as a couple or your family on Saturdays they have DJ music with a variety of good music.  The food is always great and very affordable ."}
{"text":"I should have read the yelp reviews before ordering my burrito here! I got a carne asada burrito through the drive through and when I sat down at home to eat it and took that big first anticipated bite I tasted rotting meat! Needless to say never going back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and the waiters are really interested in the quality of your experience."}
{"text":"Its ok. If you've been to \"Rosa's\" in Texas, its similar. You order your food at the register, and then you pick it up when they call your number. If you're hungry and want inexpensive, and don't mind a small restaurant, go here. If you want really good Mexican food, probably not the spot. Workers are friendly though. We were starving and needed a quick meal. This served its purpose. Just don't expect anything impressive. If you're curious, we ordered the mini chimichanga (beef....shredded) plate that came with rice & beans, Mexican nachos (large tin filled with ground beef, cheese, olives, sour cream and guacamole, taco plate (2 soft fried tacos with rice and beans), horchata, and 2 fountain drinks. Nachos were filling enough for my 9 and 7 year to share. (Keep in mind that my 9 year old eats like a teenager, and he wasn't starving after they finished, so that's a plus). Chimis were nice a crunchy & flakey. Would have been happy with 4 of those instead of the 2 with rice & beans. DH says his tacos were alright. The good thing is that their menu is pretty extensive, so there's definitely a lot to choose from. *Tip: if you order nachos and run out of chips, they have a mini salsa/chip bar, and they refill the chips constantly. Salsas aren't bad. I think they had 3 to choose from. For soups, I saw that they offer albondigas and menudo, but I think they only offer menudo on the weekend. HTH someone!"}
{"text":"Food is amazzzzinnng, however don't go through the drive thru if you're in a hurry, took my boyfriend and I 40 min to get our food and I'm not exaggerating. But the food is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I had an Ok lunch here the other day - quick shout out to the bar area around the outside - seemed like a cool hang on a non 90+ degree day.   Salsa bar - stocked! Chips and salsas a-plenty, plus onions, cilantro,   I ordered chile rellenos, a personal fave, and steak nachos. The rellenos were great, drenched in sauce, wrapped in fresh flour tortillas with a little tomato and lettuce, tasty.   The nachos had some good elements - fresh chips, tender steak, melted cheese and nacho cheese - but really fell short on the black olives and mediocre guacamole - the olives are on me, not my fave on nachos, but the guacamole was on them  Washed it down with horchata, really wish they weren't playing the same awful soap opera on ALL the TVs, maybe some ESPN or something to mix it up, but I wasn't there to watch TV."}
{"text":"Mixteca is my go-to spot for Mexican fast food. It's primarily Sonoran and Baja fare.  All the staples are very good but a few standard orders are the Torta Cubana, Carne Asada/Green Chile/Machaca burritos and shredded beef tacos.    This place isn't going to blow your mind with anything new but as far as Valley Mexican fast food chains go, this is one of the better options."}
{"text":"Fried, greasy, stomache-ache inducing food here and I gave it two tries.  Even applies for breakfast too, especially if you go for the Chiliaquiles.  Salsa bar is a letdown because each salsa is represented twice, so it looks like more options than there really are."}
{"text":"What I love about this place is kinda everything... food is pretty darn good. Mariscos are delicious and fresh. Breakfast is great, too. Wide selection of seating, inside and out. Great salsa bar and fresh variety of liquados (freshly squeezed juices). I've only used the drive-thru twice and it was pretty slow both times. For this reason, I prefer to call my order ahead so I can pick up and go. Otherwise I recommend this place to anyone considering it."}
{"text":"This is a good place to get a cheap meal. The food is nothing to write home about but it wasn't bad either and CHEAP! I liked the fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had only been to Mixteca for drinks never had eaten the food. Met one of my husbands coworkers for a Car show being held in the adjacent parking lot so it was convenient to have dinner there.  The place was packed, but was it from the food being good or the car show? We would soon find out.  It's a quick service restaurant more than a normal Mexican restaurant. You order at the counter and wait for them to call your food number.  We ordered one carne asada burro, a cheese crisp and a pint of Albondigas. This might have been a five star review if the lady taking our order would have been a little more pleasant. She never once cracked a smile. Even when my husband added a tip to our bill.  After ordering you help yourself to the salsa and chip bar and drink station. Salsas all fresh, chips a plenty. Everything was clean and free of spills.  It took forever and I mean forever to get our food.  At first glance my Albondigas was like never I had ever seen before. A big uh oh went through my head.  The bowl had very little broth with a scoop of rice, what looked like a whole boiled potato cut in fourths, a extra large carrot cut in half inch circles, large pieces of squash with my meatballs all hidden beneath. But. The broth was flavorful and the meatballs tender. If the veggies would have been cut a little smaller with less rice and more broth this soup would be my go to on a cold day.   My husband's carne burro was filled with lots of tender, diced, seasoned steak wrapped in a paper thin tortilla. He said it was so good he could have eaten another one. My husband is a small man who isn't into food so that means his burro was a 5 star.   Kids ate all but one piece of the crisp so it too must have been satisfactory.  After our meal we were wanting something sweet. Ordered a churro and cinnamon sugar chips. The chips were fried a little to long so we would probably never order again. The churro were standard but good enough and satisfied the craving.   We will definitely be returning to Mixteca."}
{"text":"I don't know if I am lucky or unfortunate to live so close to this Mixteca. You see, the food is just so good and cheap that it us difficult to use any self restraint. The ambiance is unique and there are regular patio events that look fun too.  Prices are on par with any valley berto's shop. Place your order, grab some chips and salsa from the bar and take a seat. Food is typically served quickly, but I have been in there when there was a crowd and wait times can increase. Worth it though, because the food is plentiful and superior to other area taco shops."}
{"text":"The carne asada torta was ok, but not as good as we get up in Cottonwood at Verde Lea. My hubby noticed that there was bean paste mixed in with his meat and thought that it was cheesy to use filler and not all meat.   They have really good pico and chips. The fresh fruit juice is nice and refreshing and I love the Horchata"}
{"text":"Good food, best chip and salsa bar, and operated by caring people. I've been consistently coming here for the last couple years and I'm never disappointed. I even witnessed someone (I think the owner) show kindness to a polite homeless man asking for food about to be thrown away. He instead made him a burrito and invited him to sit and eat. We need more good business like this that provide quality food and service."}
