{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this little gem since moving to the area. We ordered  take out, the dinner for two. And it was great. Their ginger beef and sweet and sour pork were crispy and so yummy!  When normally at other Chinese restaurants they are always soggy. The portions were generous and the price was reasonable. We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Very nice people with a nice small home like dinning room. Plus you get a nice amount of food for your money."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food I've ever found in the city. Friendly service and priced just right. Go check this place out!"}
{"text":"Been ordering from here since it first opened. That must be about ten years ago. Never had any problems with the orders and it has been consistently delicious. I havent found a Chinese place better than here in Calgary."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in Calgary. Amazing value and great service especially Jenny. Lunch boxes are the best value in the city. Best ginger beef on the planet."}
{"text":"This place is on the opposite end of the city for me... but its worth it.
I order food for Friday work lunches and everyone is always very impressed.
Very friendly staff. Can only say good things about this place."}
{"text":"This has been the best Chinese food we have found in the SE since moving here from Vancouver. Service is friendly and quick! We recommended some friends and they also enjoyed the food here."}
{"text":"We dined in, amazing food. Had the dinner for 2, added black pepper chicken and wonton soup to make it for 3.  We were stuffed and had leftovers. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Wow! Was really impressed. Food was hot, fresh and came to the table very quickly. This was a great discovery."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese. Probably the best Ginger Beef I've had anywhere. Dinner for one is more than enough for two! Our new go to for takeout."}
{"text":"Food was KILLER. Hot on delivery, and didn't take long to et here. We'll definitely order again"}
{"text":"Everytime my mother would order chinese it would be from this place because the food is consistently delicious. The time I recently ordered over the phone and felt very rushed and the person on the other line was not friendly or helpful at all. Seriously makes me reconsider calling again."}
{"text":"We picked up and they were really busy but still quite quick. Food was hot & quite tasty. I've had a hard time finding a good Chinese food place in the city but this will be my new go to. A quick 15 minute drive from Auburn Bay makes it handy."}
