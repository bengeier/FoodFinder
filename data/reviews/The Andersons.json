{"text":"I had the pecan pie for my birthday in October. It was just ok. I guess when I have a $23/24 pie, I expect it to taste as good as- if not better than- a pie I'd make for myself. It did not. I had high expectations for their pie and unfortunately they were not met."}
{"text":"We ordered this place for lunch at my job.  They were more than on time with the order, and everything was set up nicely and ready for us when it came time to eat.  All of the food was served hot and fresh!

They had fired chicken, broccoli casserole, mac & cheese, rolls and cookies.  I sampled the chicken, but am not really a fan of chicken period, so I can't be the judge.  The sides were delicious!  The cookies tasted like they came right out of the oven!  We had oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip.  I was happy with the lunch!"}
{"text":"I use The Andersons to cater lunch at work often and am always impressed. They are always on time and the food is always perfect. We have tried a few of the menu item from the baked potato bar to the lasagna and everything is amazing.  The price per person is extremely reasonable and includes drinks and dessert.  By dessert, I do not mean a simple cookie.  They included a real dessert - we have tried (so far!) the pecan pie, the cherry pie, the chocolate pie and the bananna pudding.  They have all been crowd pleasers.  I will continue to use The Andersons catering in the future!  So happy I found them!"}
