{"text":"Low expectations initially (from outside it looks ghetto) but the sushi was delicious and the service was great."}
{"text":"I'm allergic to crab meat and this is the only sushi restaurant I've been to that wouldn't change it to another fish. Horrible customer service. Not recommended. Plus the fish isn't fresh either"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place, but I was disappointed post-meal. The decor is nifty, and that's the only good thing. Prices are a little high, especially for the quality. Nothing tasted fresh. Even the California rolls tasted like store bought sushi. No flavour, just texture. I don't plan on going back, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I kinda want to give this place 4, and it might just get there with time! It's kind of humble. This place is our neighborhood sushi place, and we're happy to go back repeatedly.  The service is inconsistent, but the people are very nice! Not professional - but very nice. The sushi isn't amazing, but it's fine. What I really love here so far is the udon - it's smallish, but surprisingly rich and delicious. It's the perfect dish for getting over a cold... or a hangover....! 

It's pretty good value too. Fair prices. Not cheap, but... ok.

Just look out for the parking lot. And the weird sponged paint job in primary blue. Both are kinda bumpy and weird."}
{"text":"I really love their avocado rolls :) Also their bento boxes are quite good! one of my favourite sushi places~ a bit pricy though"}
{"text":"The owner is a misogynist discriminating ass. 
Disgusting allows  children to run rampant in the kitchen then kicks out a visually impaired woman because of her guide dog. referring to her as a \"Problem\" . 
Sick"}
{"text":"Pros: Great sushi, the best in the area. I'm not sure why other people are saying its not fresh as every time I've been there it has been surprisingly fresh. Crispy Salmon Rolls, Cali Rolls, Shrip rolls, tofu, and salted edamame are all great. Even the Salmon Sashimi was surprisingly good compared to most Sushi places in the GTA. Very homely atmosphere which is still clean and well put together. This place has been around for well over 10 years. They have take-out and will even deliver in the area if you spend a certain amount. Good service. Good value.

Cons: Rough/Uneven parking lot (not a big deal)"}
{"text":"Unfortunate name. Servicable sushi. Good prices. Parking. Cooked foods better than sushi. Large portions."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant in Cliffcrest.it has been that way for years.  Food is always fresh and tasty. Owner always kind, generous and helpful. Social media mob, take your negativity elsewhere. This is a decent place to eat. Don't let unbridled hatred destroy another good food establishment."}
{"text":"Really awful sushi. It's just not very fresh and they use instant miso powder. The tempura also comes from a package and is the wrong shade entirely (a sickly white versus golden brown). The salmon tastes really old and they don't even have Ikura. Maybe if you never eat sushi, you might be fooled into thinking this is acceptable, but it would never fly in Tokyo, even in some little suburb like Taito or something. It seems like someone decided that there was more money to be made in sushi than in burgers-n-fries and went into cheap, short-order sushi. A real dissapointment but at least their name tells the truth."}
{"text":"I love getting the spicy salmon set to go since i live close by. Boyfriend always says to check my bill because sometimes he charges me wrong. Anyways just writing about the sushi makes me hungry."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is consistent and reasonably good given the location. If take out is what you're after, you can't go wrong. However:

If you're looking for a place where you can enjoy a meal with a friend, keep looking. The server (the owner's child) is too young to be working but old enough to give attitude. There's a complete lack of care towards their patrons: orders arrive late (or not at all) and absolutely no followup (even though the place was empty save for one other table).

Food: Good/Average
Service: Nonexistent"}
{"text":"Spider roll was salty, miso soup and salad were average.

Fish quite fresh, however.

Be prepared to wait a long time for your food"}
{"text":"This is not the place to go if you're looking for the best sushi or the best decor
This is where you go when you're in your sweats and just wanna get some Japanese cuisine with your boyfriend. 

I'm from East York and I was stuck all the way on the east end on Easter Sunday, starving, so I drove into the first open resturant I saw which happened to be Ikki Sushi. It looked so sketchy but honestly, that's what attracted me to it. I don't know what I was expecting but what I certainly wasn't expecting was to be greeted by an adorable little boy and a nice little empty resturant. I'm a waiter at a restaurant myself and due to the lack of business on Easter Sunday, I got to go home early, essentially, I was expecting most open restaurants to be empty. I instantly loved the authentic family vibe. It wasn't perfect and that was my favourite part which made me feel very comfortable and at ease. The service was very sincere, as a waiter, I never like the chirpy up beat service. Makes me feel bad, as well as, dislike the \"fakeness\" of the waiter. I preffered their genuinuinty. The food was pretty good and price was decent as well. 
I ordered a bento box and a sushi combo which came to a total of $25 (no damage). I was pleased by the food due to comparison of sushi I've had at other large chain restaurants such as spring rolls and maki sushi and even other independently owned restaurants in downtown. However, I have also had better sushi. Other guest who came in seemed to be regulars. 
Overall, I was mostly impressed by unexpectedness and homey, comfortable vibe of the resturant. 
My boyfriend and I will definitely drop by again for casual dates."}
{"text":"The food may be  tolerable, their treatment of handicapped appalling. Lots of great sushi in the city so avoid this one"}
{"text":"Originally planned to hit Zen on Eglington (supposedly Scarborough's premier sushi joint) but it was closed for lunch on Saturdays so found Ikki Sushi a few minutes away on Kingston Road. Only customer at 1 pm on a Saturday afternoon. Chef welcomed me from the top of a ladder. Not sure what he was doing - later heard a bird chirping so maybe he was trying to catch it or maybe it was in a cage in the kitchen. I shied away from ordering anything with feathers but did order the large sushi combo - took a picture with the Yelp app on my iPhone so hope it shows up somewhere here. Salad was fresh and dressing delicious if a little heavily applied. Miso soup was tasty and warming on a cold wet afternoon. For $15.95 the combo provided a hearty helping for a sushi-starved lad from the boonies. Fish was fresh and the pieces were much larger than I had experienced at other sushi places. Spicy tuna rolls were outstanding. I don't have experience with super high-end sushi but this was as good as I have tasted. Perhaps a little more crudely assembled than some I have had but that is hardly a complaint as it provided ample sushi satisfaction. Recommended if you find yourself looking for sushi on a Saturday in Scarborough or any other day for matter. Ikki Sushi... not so ikki in my book."}

You can not tell someone to leave their guide dog in the car and you should be ashamed of yourself. This dog gives this woman independence and you can't request that her husband guide her because of this. 
Guide dogs go into food establishments everyday and by law you can not ask or tell them to leave. These are working dogs, they're not pets. 

Please take a look at bill 70.
Service dogs are protected from discrimination. Not allowing this dog into your establishment did not only go against the law but also Canadian human rights. 

I hope you learn from this experience and will not let this happen again."}

{"text":"Salmon was very red.. Instead of the usual orange

They used Tabasco as hot sauce instead of siracha in the mix for spicy salmon maki. Did not taste good.

Chicken katsu was very good.. We got a huge portion. 

Good food selection, pricing is decent.

Parking lot is very run down with massive potholes and no painted lines.

Maybe I would come here again.. But probably not"}

+Atmosphere is okay feels like Japan so that's always nice
+Sushi chef is a really nice guy if you get to know him"}
{"text":"Terrible! Do not waste your money here, this is the worst sushi house I've 
ever been to. 

My wife was craving for sashimi so we found this place, and just like other sushi house, this place is ran by Chinese but not Japanese. 

We ordered large sashimi combo, oyaku don( chicken with egg, onion on top of rice), fried tofu and black dragon roll. 

So the food, from the sashimi combo I picked out fish bones! I've never had sashimi served with fish bones! And the squid in the sashimi plate just tasted weird, it released salty and thick goo when you chewing it, the feeling was just disgusting! 

The oyaku don is tasteless, the egg on the top of rice totally lost tenderness, in 'real' oyaku don, egg is supposed to be silky and tender, I'd say they screwed it up and eventually I had to order another bowl of miso soup to help me swallow the bowl of rice, chicken and egg mixture.

The black dragon roll was not bad, the fried tofu? We even couldn't finish it! Deep fried tofu chunks coated by fish flakes I think, but since the fish flakes were deeply fried as well, which just made this dish more oily, we didn't like it. 

We will never come back to ikki sushi ever, the owner/ chef should really go to other sushi house and try their food, hopefully they can at least learn how to serve sashimi right."}
{"text":"Summary: The building has poor appearance, but the food is good and service is decent. I recommend this place cautiously.

I came here on the recommendation of a friend. From the outside, the parking lot looks poorly maintained and the building has chipping paint. On the inside, the decorations are okay (not excellent or bad), but the bathrooms are ugly. My expectations were set low.

When we ordered and our food arrived, I was delighted that it looked and tasted normal. The ingredients (esp. meat and vegetables) tasted fresh, and my fears didn't materialize.

I feel a bit bad for the couple of waiters and kitchen staff who were serving our sudden influx of ~20 people on a Sunday night. Some responses took longer than ideal, but I think they did a good job given the circumstances.

The handwritten receipt was a bit of an oddity. It's been so long since I've encountered one; something like 1 in 30 restaurants maybe."}
{"text":"I will start this review by saying that I don't eat sushi. I go end up at sushi restaurants from time to time because of people I am with and am glad they have other things on the menu as well. Ikki Sushi was no exception to this.

My friend ordered her sushi and I ordered beef teriyaki and steamed rice. It was not on the menu, but the waiter was good enough to put it together for me. Which brings me right to my next point, I was able to understand the waiter clearly and he was able to understand me which does not happen too often at a lot of the restaurants I visit. The beef came to the table really fast, followed by the sushi a few minutes later. Me being polite I did not start eating until her food arrived, but the very nice aroma of the beef had me salivating beyond control.

When I finally got to taste the food it was very good. One problem that I usually have with sushi places and meat is that they tend to over cook it. The outside piece I ate was nicely cooked. As I got closer to the center of the cutlet of beef it got down to medium rare which actually made me happy. At first I thought they were a little heavy on the sauce, but the amount of rice that I was given and the tastiness of the sauce itself made the amount of sauce very valid. I don't usually get much feedback about the taste of the food from my friend, but she seemed to enjoy the sushi. If she didn't like it I would have definitely heard, so it couldn't have been bad.

It was definitely not a high-class sushi restaurant, and the prices reflected that as well. It reminded me of many of the sushi restaurants I have been outside the city, but would not pass for acceptable in the core. For a quick bite out in the east end though, not bad."}
{"text":"Bob, you are a law breaker and an awful person for not letting that visually impaired woman in with her guide dog. You don't leave a guide dog outside as you suggested. 

You so blatantly have broken the law and admitted as much to the global news interviewer. You deserve the full consequence of breaking the law, and I hope the bad publicity forces you to shut down and get out of our neighborhood. 

I will do everything I can to tell people about your discriminatory practise and try to reduce your business as much as possible. 

As a sidebar, I've eaten here in the past and never came back due to the food being barely mediocre."}
{"text":"Eh. Small, not very nice looking. Sushi is.. Ok to not great. We waited forever to be served and get our food. I won't be coming back here again. The wait staff are very nice though, but I wasn't impressed with the food and wait time."}
{"text":"My Neighbour and I teamed up together to enjoy a bottle of wine and tempera.  I ordered a bento and it was enough to fill along with lots of flavor.  My favorite part was we were not rushed to get out!!"}

{"text":"Ikki Sushi is one of the most homey restaurant I been to! No snobby Japanese Sushi Chef or Cool Japanese waitresses in Kimonos... Just a Japanese family owned sushi joint. 

Ikki has no swanky or chic decoration... It is kind of outdated and run downed and dare I say a little dumpy... 

Father as the Sushi chef and Mother as the Kitchen Chef.. and their son... a cute little boy is the assistant waiter... 

When that boy served my Lunch Special California and Spicy Tuna Roll ($7.95) to me and asked me to eat.. I could not stop smiling.... 

For the price, the sushi is not bad... I had better... and I had worse... but is the hospitality and that family vibe that made this lunch memorable."}
