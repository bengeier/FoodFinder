{"text":"no atmosphere whatsoever. service was impossibly sloooooowwwwww. I had the worst pizza ever. it was supposed to be buffalo chicken. no buffalo and very little chicken. not sure why I even gave it 2 stars."}
{"text":"Came to eat here after the renovation. We had buffalo chicken pizza, a calzone, and a house salad. Everything was delicious! You can tell the ingredients are fresh and the dough is homemade. The atmosphere was awesome, we loved the Pittsburgh theme and the bar looks really nice too. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This is for the \"Beer Barn\" section of Stella's in the back. They carry a pretty good selection, but their prices on 12 packs of twisted tea (in cans mind you) are outrageous. Twenty dollars? It's 25 for a case of bottles. Staff is usually friendly, so that's another plus. But 2.50 for a deuce deuce of Old E? You're killing me Stella! Get with the rest of the country on your prices."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently went thru a very nice decor and menu changes. It is wonderful. Some old favorites are still there like the wings,Stella sticks, and d & m pizza. But new additions and special are always fresh and delicious. Staff as always are still friendly and courteous. It a must in New Ken."}
{"text":"Was curious to check this place out after seeing it on restaurant rescue.  For one, it looks amazing! Was happy to see they put tv's back up after. Though the wiring was a mess. I install home theaters for a living so I'm going to notice these things in a place that is otherwise pristine. Staff was super nice and attentive.  Now, food. The menu is slim, good thing though. Do a few things well, much better than having a horde of items half assed.  I ordered the stuffed banana peppers. They looked great! But, were barely warm. Not sure if the sausage was cooked the whole though. It had a strange texture. Something I'll update tomorrow. I.e. will I be ill later... Menu is priced nicely except for the pizza. A notorious margin machine... I'm going with 3 stars for now, mainly on aesthetic. Will come back to sample more. Update soon..."}
{"text":"Best wings ever :) and try the Stella Sticks!  The salads are HUGE!!!"}
{"text":"I was recently informed that the gnocchi is back on the menu. The last time I had it there it was amazing. It was the perfect texture, not mushy at all. Paired with the mushroom alfredo sauce, it is delightful. I'm glad Stella's brought the entrees back. We will be back soon, I love supporting small businesses that make quality food for everyone's taste buds."}
{"text":"Before and after the remodel, we love Stella's.  Before the food was great and the so was the service.  After the remodel the food was better and the service was still good and friendly.   I love that Stellas is a hometown bar.   What does that mean?  They support the locals, they care about the service, and they care what they're serving.   We are Friday night regulars and whether it's busy or slow, we receive the same great service.   We'll continue to be loyal customers.   Ps Jamie and Dom the pizzas were a HIT for Ty's birthday party!!   Thank you"}
{"text":"Very good lasagna!! Decor could use an update and service is not very friendly.  The food is good though, so worth a try."}
{"text":"Restaurant Impossible did a fantastic renovation  The menu appears lighter and anxious to try the new food items. The gnocchi with mushroom Alfredo was great. Fresh new atmosphere. And Felicia as my server....good day after all."}
{"text":"Great calzones and wings, plus they have Shock Top on tap."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants!  Great food and super friendly service.  We bring our 1 year old daughter here and have also had a huge party here with about 50 guests.  Stellas has the best gyro...ever!  Their gyro pizza and their regular cheese pizzas are also really tasty. The D & M pizza is like the P&M in Arnold.  Their wings are huge and delicious!  We have also had their \"Saddle\" sandwich: the half is enough for 2 people!  Go there and enjoy... you won`t regret it!"}
{"text":"I love Stella's wings with their Stella's sauce!!  They are better than the other wings in the area! Their chicken salads are also delicious and have a bunch of extra goodies in the.  Stella's is one of the very few places where I will order wedding soup, it's just like mine!"}
{"text":"We were regular faithful customers ... until the remodel.  I loved Stella's prior to that and would have recommended it to everyone.  You were treated like family. Waitresses were personable.  When we went after the remodel it was apparent that the goal was to hurry us to order, hurry us to eat, and hurry us out the door.  And our friendly waitress... lost her job.  Won't EVER go back."}
{"text":"Calzone was awesome.  Kids got their own Jr. Pizzas.  Best pizza in the area.  The calzone has a \"sweet\" taste to it.  Crust was golden and cooked to perfection.  The kid's loved their pizza and said it had lots of yummy cheese.....the way they like it.  Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I'm torn the pizza was good and so were the sloppy fries.  However sloppy fries are a 4 dollar up charge and they have us very little gravy. We asked for more and they obliged. I ordered wings as well.   Well cooked but a huge swing and a miss.  I asked for them naked with a honey badger sauce.  They came with season salt on them and some crap sauce that looked like salad dressing on the side. We asked if this sauce was right and the waitress said yes immediately followed by another bringing out a different sauce saying that the first one was not right.  Both were equally bad though. 20 dollars for a dozen wings to have them come out incorrectly with foul tasting sauce is not a good business model.  There are far better wings to be had in the area."}
{"text":"Wings are the best!  Homemade dressings for the salads are very good too."}
