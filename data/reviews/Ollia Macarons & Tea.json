{"text":"Ollia is nothing short of wonderful. Went for the first time today and could not believe the quality of their macarons!! Each one was so amazing! 10/10 would come again."}
{"text":"Best macaroon in town! I tried different places and the macaroon at Ollia is the most delightful"}
{"text":"These macarons are simply amazing.  I used to live in France and these are 100% comparable to La Duree.. in fact they are even better!  The owners are incredibly nice people, great atmosphere and they even have a rewards program.. incentives for buying more macarons! Need I say any more?   Must visit!"}
{"text":"I always struggle with deciding which flavour to try when I go into this place. Usually I choose something chocolatey or with peanuts, but they have a pretty good range of flavours for every tastebud. Last time they even had curry flavoured macarons, but I wasn't quite so adventurous.   Really not much to say other than the fact that their macarons have never let me down. I usually just get one, and savour the flavour of each bite. Really a proper dessert. Don't need a lot to enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"My favs. Definitely one of my all time favs. Not a lot of people think of tea and macarons but seriously, how classy is that pairing???  What's unique about Ollia is that along with the traditional sweet macarons, the Parisian macaron trained chef uses savoury flavours for their macarons making them more aligned with the Pierre Hermes style macaron vs the Lauduree kind which is more popular here. So what's a savoury macaron? *whisky chocolate  *fig and balsamic *maple bacon *blue cheese pear and pecan  Flavors ftw.   Now what about presentation? Even sized shells and beautiful feet. This is edible art!  Come by to Ollia while exploring 17th! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"So small and quaint. Very elegant atmosphere. The macarons tasted great (although half of them were swiped from me by my friends). I wish they had a small seating area, but it's a very tiny place. I also wish they had a bigger drink selection.  I also got a gift card so my seventh purchase (I think?) of six or more macarons is free. It'll probably take me a while to win that grand prize, but it was sweet."}
{"text":"Ollia is the most authentic, utterly delicious, perfect, beautiful Macaron shop in Calgary. Other macaron purveyors in town must be quivering in their boots now that Ollia has opened. They are made by an actual French macaron-trained baker, and it shows. I've been here five times now, and every time I just about die.  (And I used to live in France, so I do know a thing or two about how they are supposed to look and taste!)"}
{"text":"Great Macarons. I love stopping by when I'm in the area and getting a couple. Always fun to try something different.   Also the YYC hot chocolate fest beverage is amazing. It was described to me as their Ferraro rocher macaron in liquid form, and I'd say that's pretty accurate. The whipped cream on it is almost better than the hot chocolate. Would recommend trying it while it's around."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and truly a hidden gem tucked away in the heart of 17th Ave. I had the fortunate experience to take their Macaron 101 Baking Class. The staff and owners are amazing and wonderful people. It was my first time to go there and definitely won't be my last. I love that they support other local businesses. Highly recommend this place wether you going for an afternoon tea and sweet treat, or want a fun night of learning. Love to see them introduce a Macaron 201 Baking Class to continue on the knowledge!"}
{"text":"One of the great places to get quality Macarons to paid perfectly well with tea or coffee. The service was great and helpful. The texture was perfect for me, crunch on the outside while soft on the inside. Any flavors with Chocolates & Earl Gray are my favorite. It is a little pricey for me, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This store has hands down, the best macarons I've ever had. Great, delicious normal flavours. Seriously, 5 stars. Only down fall is they close sooo early on some days but products are amazing!!"}
{"text":"I love macarons, and visited Ollia after hearing my friends rave about it. However, I was a little disappointed. It's rather expensive for a tiny cookie, and what really threw me off was the texture. It was way too chewy and dense, and macarons are typically supposed to be light, with a meringue-like bite. They have some unique flavours though, such as maple bacon, and creme brulee. I might come again, just to try something new, or if I'm in the mood for a macaron."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my girlfriend today for some loose leaf tea and a sample box of macaroons $14 box of 7 (earl grey, salted caramel, cotton candy, pistachio, passion fruit, lavender, and ?blue cheese pecan and something). Super fresh, soft and ooey gooey. Packaged nicely, great for gifts. A couple of small table for two out front, but generally it's a stop and go.   Update: Alright I did it! My first attempt at baking macarons under the direct supervision of David (the owner with a beautiful accent) thank you for your patience. Super fun class  and no baking experience required, $100 per person you can sign up online, classes do fill up fast. I would try to get your own group of peeps together (minimum of 8) to get your own class going. I got to take home 32 of my own creations, white chocolate raspberry, Italian style meringue and red velvet without food coloring (I am thoroughly impressed with myself) and sample a couple of the stores while I sipped tea and waiting for the shells to bake. Wear comfy shoes, my class was 2.5 hours. Now I just need someone to buy me a kitchen aid.."}
{"text":"Fist off, let's just talk about the pronunciation and spelling of this little cookie and wait to talk about its delicious qualities in a bit... the macaROON is an entirely different cookie which is coconut based. The macaRON is a light meringue based cookie that comes in an endless array of flavours. This delicate treat has a crunchy exterior and a weightless interior with a soft ending that's almost nougat-like in its chewiness. They both have the same first two syllables because the name is derived from the Italian \"ammaccare\" which when translated means, to crush. To add to the confusion, it's often called a French MacaROON! Hope that helps educate a few of you as I was unsure of this distinction before my last trip to France and I have dedicated myself to educating people since I took a cooking class to learn the difference.   Now let's talk about Ollia Macarons and tea. Their website is: www.byollia.com if you want to see all the beautiful colours or take a class.  Ollia's Macarons come in a wide variety of flavours both sweet & savoury. Usually David Rousseau, chef and co-owner with have about 205-30 flavours at any given time. Usually about 5 of those are savoury and are typically served in France as an appetizer.  Champagne, Rose, Lemon, Salted Caramel, Earl Grey, Raspberry, Pistachio and Turtle are just a few of the flavours I have tried. I find that it's a nice treat to take my friends into this cute little store and grab a couple Macarons for the drive back home to Strathmore. Unfortunately, they don't usually last even to the city limits  Their Macarons are light, colourful and are all beautifully displayed in a glass showcase. They are about $2.25 each or you can purchase 7 for $14.00  The time and love that goes into each little cookie is phenomenal! I love to support small local businesses that care about their people, their ingredients and their communities. Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with a coworker to pick-up a rose and raspberry macaron cake for another coworker's birthday - it was absolutely stunning and it tasted delicious albeit a little sweet.  I couldn't resist the case, so decided to snack on a strawberry rhubarb macaron before our walk back to work - also, so amazingly good!  The shop is beautifully decorated and the staff was very welcoming and friendly.  These macarons are absolutely legit!"}
{"text":"We were in town for our anniversary trip and stopped by to grab some treats. French Macarons are not super common here in the US so I was so excited to not only have them available, but in so many flavors. We went with with a 12 pack so we could try a bunch of flavors. We had the sweet girl working the counter pick out the flavors for us. They were all delicious, but I think we enjoyed the Creme Brulee the most. I also picked up a kit to try to make the cookies at home. I wish we lived closer so I could take one of the classes that they offer."}
{"text":"I would agree that these are arguably the best macarons in town, if not anywhere.  They offer your average bite-sized (at least for me) macarons but it's the filling that really makes all the difference.  You can certainly taste the ingredients in each individual, and it's not just jam squeezed in between.  If you love macarons, this place is a MUST.  I would put these morsels among the very best that Paris has to offer.  Not all pastry shops in Paris are good....it's really no different than here or any other place...it simply depends on the talent of the pastry chef, and at Ollia's, they certainly know what they're doing."}
{"text":"I wondered by when I was going to West Elm and stopped in for a few Macarons. I love Macarons, bite size little treats when they are fresh.   This place, Ollia, on a Sunday was not very busy. The little boutique was cute and quaint. The treats had a decent variety and it appears that their offerings were limited. I picked up a small pack sampling.   There were two stand outs. And the rest were blah!  The champagne was amazing- it was like champagne. And the peanut butter chocolate was awesome. The rest were gross.   With exception of the two, the others were dry, flaky and fell apart when you bite into it. They should not be crusty, crunchy or flakey. For the price, it's not worth it.   Save your money and move on. What a waste"}
{"text":"I love macarons, so I had to stop by. I bought a couple of boxes for Christmas gifts (one of them I gave to ME). They are all gluten free, and they had my favourite 'cookies and cream' flavour. They're 2$ each (sounds like a lot for something so small no?) Yet it seems like you can't get 'em any cheaper 'round here at least. So then, four stars I say!   Plus they have tea, and it's pretty decent too! Not the same ol 'mighty leaf' everyone else is selling. They have a wider selection with a couple types of Oolong along side several green selections, and black etc."}
{"text":"Hopped in here on a cold rainy day, which ended up being the perfect solution to the rainy blues. You feel like you are walking into France with the classical music and the open air atmosphere and clean white walls with pastel accents. It is a small space in the front, you can see clear into the back where the magic happens for baking. They sell macarons, tea leaves, brewed tea, tea accessories, and even pre made mixes to make your own macarons at home! I decided to get a tea, cause again cold and rainy day, and a pack of 7 macarons for $14. I bought the whiskey chocolate, banana chocolate, mint chocolate, rochee, earl grey, black current, and coconut chocolate. Regardless the box was finished by the end of the night! I sipped the tea, which was delightful! An earl grey mix, and nibbled at the whiskey chocolate as I was huddled under the gazebo across the street. Just enough of a whiskey kick to make you feel bad ass and elegant at the same time! The cookie part was nice and light with a bit of chewiness, and the fillings were soft and complimented each macaron. The Earl Grey was a pleasant surprise as it really tasted like an edible earl grey cup of tea! Highly recommend if you like tea or floral flavored treats. Overall a delicious and worthwhile visit, I would love to go back and try some more flavors, it is definitely a bit pricey, so a once in a blue moon treat, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"During my visit to Alberta, I stopped by three bakeries that had French Macarons. Ollia had the most expensive ($2.25 each) out of the three. I usually do a test where I only order 1 or 2 macarons and then try them. If I like them, I come back and order a half dozen or more, if not I just leave. I really liked the flavors that they had! They had a macaroon flavored macaron which I thought was GENIUS. I decided just to purchase their creme brulee flavored macaron.  What I didn't like about their macarons was the texture. There's many interpretations to macarons on how the texture should be. I feel like the standard texture you would expect for a macaron would that the outer shell is a little crispy and the center is fluffy and chewy. The macaron itself did not have a crispy outer shell, it wasn't really fluffy. The inside was a bit moist and super chewy, which was a bit unpleasant.  The flavor was really good though! I definitely thought of creme brulee when I bit into it, which I appreciated.   The workers here are also really nice! I just didn't really like the texture and price of the macarons, especially for the size."}
{"text":"The macaroons were delicious. They were fresh and had fun flavors, like rhubarb strawberry, chili chocolate, and turtle. I've had macaroons in Paris and I loved these ones just as much!"}
{"text":"Ollia makes some delicious macarons, they also have a good selection of tea. The owners are really passionate about what they do and are super friendly when you come in. They make great seasonal flavours that make great gifts for friends for all types of events. They also offer macaron making classes which I took with a bunch of friends, we did the private class and it was a lot of fun, you get full instruction, have the chance to make a lot of macarons (depending on how many you mess up/are able to make) with a break for macarons to snack on and tea."}
{"text":"I was here about a month ago and ordered 6 assorted macarons. Every single one of them was hard and tasted like they weren't freshly baked. Not sure if it was just an off-day for them considering all of the other great reviews - but our experience was bad enough that I don't think I'll be coming back when there are better places nearby. I like the atmosphere and the girls there were friendly but the macarons were just awful."}
{"text":"Anyone that knows me, knows that I love macarons. I have tried contenders within Calgary, and have been to Paris to taste the \"original\" macaron by Laudree.   I am often disappointed with the selection of flavours available, but NOT at Ollia! The first time I tried Ollia macarons there must have been at least 30 flavours available! It was incredible! We ordered 14, scampered off to the car, and ate nearly all of them before arriving at home.. Savouring each and every bite.   In the same night, I decided to sign my partner and I up for a macaron making class.. Equally amazing! David (the France native and owner) was funny, informative and a great teacher. My portion of the macarons turned out extremely well, and I can't wait to whip up a batch of my own at home and experiment with flavours I love the most. I do wish the recipes we use in the class were a little more exciting - we made Raspberry with a White Chocolate Ganache and a natural Red Velvet with Cream Cheese. (Salted Caramel would have been SO much better! Who doesn't love Salted Caramel?!) In the end, we went home with about 25 macarons and after they had \"aged\", I pretty much inhaled them all. Macarons for breakfast, lunch and dinner.. Because, why not? :)"}
{"text":"Can't go near 17th without hitting up Ollia. Scrumptious macarons. There are too many yummy flavor combinations to choose from, so my hubby and I like to order a bunch to share and then take a bite of each flavor.   We also took the Macaron Baking Class a few years ago which was such a fun date night. We had tons to take home too, so it was definitely worth the cost."}
{"text":"By far, aside from Laduree, Ollia has one of the best macarons in Calgary.  Eating gluten free is quite a pain when it comes to having desserts but thank goodness for Ollia's macarons, such craving is met if not surpassed.  Lindsay and Dave's place in Mount Royal Village is a chic and really pleasant place for dessert. We met them when they were very new in the business and really glad they are doing well as they truly have the passion and love of what they do.  Personally, I like their savory flavored macarons while hubby loved the sweet variety."}
{"text":"Ollia Macarons & Tea Private Macaron Baking Class Saturday, April 11, 2015  I wanted to do something abit different for my sister's bachelorette party that doesn't involve bar hopping and staying in the city. I had read a review through Yelp about macaron baking classes at Ollia Macarons & Tea so thought it would be a great activity for a bachelorette party. Our instructor (also the owner), David was awesome! He was so informative and patient with our group. We had made raspberry ganache macarons and vanilla cheesecake macarons. David had provided everything for the class as well as step-by-step instructions for everyone. As a private group, we were able to BYOB for the class which was a perfect touch for our bachelorette group. David also had provided our group with Rooibos tea and 3 flavors of macarons for everyone. Passionfruit milk chocolate was my favourite! I absolutely would take Ollia's macaron baking class as well as recommend it! It was so much fun! I would defiantly be back for Ollia's macarons and tea!"}
{"text":"OMG soo so so good.... and a macaroon macaron WHAT?!?!? That is what got us in there in the first place, I was having a conversation with my friend and he said whats the difference anyways. Well we were passing by so I said let's go get macarons!! BEST IDEA OF THE DAY They were so good, we got 7 and wow, we had a hard time picking our favorites in the end... I really want to go back and take a class on how to make them... how much fun would that be?? Dale??? Do I sense a Future Yelp event?"}
{"text":"They are ok. But I do notice that they are not all consistent in terms of their macarons. So I got a box of 8 macarons for $16. And some are fresh and fluffy and some not so much.   The cotton candie wasn't too fresh. They were not too fluffy tasting. The earl grey was fresh (maybe freshly made on the day). They were sweet but the right amount of sweetness to them. Good size as well.   Well overall, good selections of flavor. Its near 17th Ave (trendy location). I can see parking to be difficult to find."}
{"text":"If you want a little piece of heaven in your mouth then you should probably come here.   I've never tasted a better macaron in my life, and the texture was absolutely perfect. Salted caramel and cotton candy are my absolute faves. I get 7 for $14, and although they are smaller than other macarons in the city, they are worth it. They also offer home made caramels in a variety of different flavours which are a tasty treat.   They have a loyalty card system as well, so if you want to frequent the shop like myself make sure you grab one."}
{"text":"I love the size of their Macarons.  I had to get that off my chest. Their selection is displayed beautifully and their flavours are on point. They actually taste like what the name card says! The cashier kindly informed me the eating instructions for them, and that I could freeze and refrigerate them as well. Know what happened... I bought another dozen because of that. Tsktsk. She has now caused me to stockpile them. My favorite flavor from this location was their lavender honey, you gotta try it at least once!  The tea addict in me hovered and awed over their ever so cute tea selection. I have yet to try my purchases though. Will so an update on that later on :3  Perk: they have a macaron loyalty card. Another excuse for me to visit over and over again :3"}
{"text":"This place is definitely over hyped. I went in on Saturday and got a box of macaroons. Majority of them tasted old and bland. The only one that was good was the lemon poppyseed. They were not light and fluffy what's so ever. Also they were out of so many flavours it was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Having Fun at the baking class!!! Got 37 macarons to take back home Teacher is so friendly and nice!! Highly recommend it!!! SIGN UP"}
{"text":"If I were a store, this is the store I would want to be.   Ollia is a girly, glam, decadent, delicious oasis. This shop carries a ton of marvelous macaron flavours. As the seasons change so do the flavours. I love, LOVE, the Rocher (hazelnut-chocolate), mint-chocolate, salted caramel and that is just naming a few... this list could go on and on forever.  It's $14 for a box of 7. At first, it seems a bit pricey but it is definitely worth the price tag. The macarons are filling and I have yet to finish a box-- but believe me I am up for that challenge!!  Along with the macarons they do serve tea, which I didn't try because I spent a hardy lump-sum on the treats-- but I do recall the tea lattes costing about $4.50. And they have baking classes too! Like, c'mon! Ollia is worthy of a 5-star rating!"}
{"text":"Best macarons is calgary. Can be compared to those in Paris. The latest puff parry desserts are phenomenal. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love macarons, but rarely visit By Ollia because of parking! Made it here the other day and picked up a 7-flavour box for 14$ which seems to be the standard rate for macarons in Calgary these days. The flavour assortment was good, and I picked up one savoury macaron (maple bacon) out of curiousity as my 'bonus' 7th macaron - the sensation was a bit odd but the bacon flavour definitely came through! Their iced teas are also very good, though I wish they used a filter to poor as I had a lot of loose leaf bits in my tea at the bottom, which weren't as pleasant to drink!   The store decor is beautiful and the staff are so helpful. I'll definitely be back... when parking permits!"}
{"text":"Oh my god, can we PLEASE talk about this place??  The first and only time (so far) that I'd ever been here was on Valentine's Day for their Macaron making class.  There were 6 of us who knew each other and who signed up.  (about 90/person).  and then another couple was there as well.  We started the class at about 7 pm and the chef/owner (I feel awful that I can't remember his name) was from France! He and his lovely wife started this Macaron and Tea shop with homemade and organic everything.  Sourced locally and from neighbouring provinces, this store is incredible.  In our class we learned how to make Macarons, all the techniques necessary, the fillings, etc.  We even left with a booklet with the recipes and tips and tricks.  My friends and I were expecting to leave with about a dozen or so Macarons.. um we left with f*&king 60 macarons per couple.  60!!!!  Each one more delicious and amazing than the last!  He was the sweetest pastry chef.  He was interested in our history of baking, what we did, he really enjoyed feedback and watching us have fun.  This was truly a unique, fun, awesome experience.  Worth every penny and I recommend this Macaron class so much.  Whether for a first date, or date night as a married couple, or with a gal pal, this is just such a special experience.  Each Macaron is sold for 2$ each and um, now I know why.  The amount of work that goes into each and every one is extraordinary.  He also likes to dabble with savoury flavours and you can hear his passion when he speaks about his store, this city, and the good reception Ollia's has received.  While waiting for our outside pieces to rise, we were invited to have some bubbly and heart shaped Macarons in the store.  So friggin cute. Cookies, donuts, cupcakes will come and go, but MACARONS ARE HERE TO STAY!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying, I wish I could give this place 10 stars.  Before discovering Ollia's, I resorted to corbeaux for macarons. Well let me tell you, when my Fiancé brought these home to me, I shrieked out of joy! We even snuck a few in before dinner. I tried a variety of flavours ranging from, white peach raspberry to matcha green tea and just about everything in between. As if the flavours weren't enough, the texture was out of this world.  So classic and tasted as if I were back in Paris.   We are now considering their classes for Macaronage and also considering having a macaron tower from them instead of a wedding cake!  Completely blown away. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"I can't say this place was that good. Their macarons were too sweet and not balanced right.  I have definitely had better macarons."}
{"text":"I took a macaron baking class at Ollia and had the best time! Our instructor was very knowledgeable, fun, and very responsive to all of the questions the students had.  In class, we each had our own bowl of the almond/icing sugar/egg white mixture and was shown the macaron process step by step. It was great because each student was able to see and experience how macarons are made by a professional! We made raspberry and chocolate macarons during the class, each student taking over 30 macarons home with them. Talk about great deal!   I would recommend anyone interested in learning how to make macarons (or just wanting to buy some - their cotton candy macaron is SO good!) to visit Ollia!"}
{"text":"my coworkers & I had the pleasure of stopping by today for a couple of macarons, and what a treat!  the lady at the counter was charming and friendly, and we could see the bakers in the back doing their thing which i thought was neat!  I chose rose flavour, and I think tegan got a coffee flavoured one, and Andy lavender? All of us were pleased with our choices, and I might swing by tomorrow to try a few more! very welcome addition to Mount Royal Village!"}
