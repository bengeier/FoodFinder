{"text":"I've just completed my review of Ka Chi... the Owl is better.  Back in the summer, my friends and I stopped by here as first timers.  They had the pork bone soup and as usual I always like to try the bibimbap for comparison.   The quality is close but better value and service here.  My friends also liked their soup... huge portions so great value and tasty.  If you happen to find it without someone giving you a recommendation then you get the bonus points cos it's a Korean restaurant in a predominantly Chinese mall with low exposure.  It looks like a family operation but oddly located upstairs in the mall and tucked away in the corner.   I'll definitely try the soup next time we're in the mood for Korean soup.  They gave us a small soy drink after wards... nice touch.  4 stars if you happen to find it."}
{"text":"I've only had the pork bone soup here, so I can't comment on anything else but if you do come here, you don't even need to open the menu - it's all about the Gam Ja Tang! Served in a bowl with shanks of pork that easily slips off the bone along with potatoes simmered in a red hot spicy soup with rice on the side for only $5.99. If you want a peek at Korean comfort food, this is the place to go. Enjoy picking the meat off the bones with your fingers and sucking all the goodness out of them. Once that's done, trash the bones, dunk the rice into the soup and finish it off. It's REALLY cheap and the servers here are amazingly nice as well!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say the best pork bone soup but I wouldn't say bad either. It's just every time I went their soup tend to be different flavours. But everything else is alright"}
{"text":"I swear this place was 24h...  Anyway, I had the classic pork bone soup, but I was really disappointed in the meal. There was literally nothing else in the soup except three chunks of pork bone and one small potato. Where are the vegetables?  They call the rice brown, but it looked mostly like white rice with a small handful of something multigrain to make it change colour.  Lastly, it was super expensive. After tax and tip for one meal was $12. Okay, not absolutely expensive, but relatively expensive for Korean food. For a Korean soup dish, $7-8 is the average price. And at other restaurants, those soup dishes include vegetables."}
{"text":"Open 24/7. I was craving Korean food after midnight and they did not disappoint. Sit down, pick the food, push the button for service, and your food is ready in 5 minutes. Dumplings taste like homemade, the dolsot bim bim nap was a generous portion and the prices were very good!! Yum!"}
{"text":"I shared the dolsot bibimbap and japchae with the hubby. The bibimbap was spot on, with brown rice option. Japchae was really good until you are half way through the dish. It became very salty and overly flavourful. Glad we shared it, otherwise it would've been too much. Their complimentary green tea is very nice, very authentic Korean."}
{"text":"This place recently renovated so it's much larger now and also has a washroom so you don't have to go to the mall ones.. (i'm highly scared of bacteria in washrooms downtown..)  This is my go-to place for korean food down town. The pork bone soup is fairly big with lots of meat for only 6.99. and i LOVE the cucumber side dish! and kimchi.. so yummy. I've also had the bugolgi here and it was decent.  Staff are friendly and make sure you are having a good experience. Also, at the end of the meal, they give you those little Asian yogurt drinks.  Next time i go, i want to try their barbecue things! It's new on their menu and the tables have a grill embedded in them. I believe it will be more authentic than Korean Grill House."}
{"text":"Ordered pork bone soup ($7.99), which I believe  their special dish. I have been to their restaurant in North York and they served exactly same pork bone soup here. Piping hot soup and large portion of pork bone. When you order a dish here, they serve a bowl of rice and lots (six, if I remember correctly) of side dishes including kimchi. They accept only cash and debit (over $20)."}
{"text":"'Tis the season to celebrate, fellow Yelpers, for delicious gamjatang has come waaayyy downtown, right in the heart of Chinatown. That's right, the famous Owl of Minerva has found a new place to perch, and it feels oh so good.  Located in the corner of the second floor of Dragon City, it's nestled away from too much of the hustle and bustle of Spadina. Opened in mid-December (of 2009), there are less than 10 tables in this place, so get here before word gets out. In chatting with the friendly staff here, apparently they are affiliated with the more \"genuine\" Owl uptown, but not the one on Bloor Street. Strange.  Not strange, however, is the quick and courteous service and bang-on pork bone soup. Bibambap comes in a piping hot stone pot with flavourful rice that was still burning my mouth in the last few bites. Atmosphere is small and simple, and in our first couple of visits happened to be playing the Mariah Carey holiday album on loop. What is also great is the open kitchen so you can see exactly where (and from whom) your food comes from.  Homecooking-away-from-home at it's best. Welcome downtown, dear Owl."}
{"text":"i think the food wasn't that bad. but the place wasnt really legit clean, cuz i saw this lady that works there, picking her nose (eww, but maybe she washed her hands later) the price is fine not too expensive but not cheap.. if anyone reading is gonna go there, i recommend to order the any of their soup (it was good that time i went) but the rest on the menu is okay"}
{"text":"I went here last night around 1am (slim pickings if you're craving Korean food after 11pm). I did NOT want to come here because I haven't had great food at the other locations (Shouldn't the Koreatown location have the best??? I went to the one on bloor late at night as well) but alas, my friends and I needed some spicy Korean food in our bellies.  My friend and I ordered the chapjae and kimchi jeon. DELICIOUS! I was even more surprised by the banchan: pickled cucumbers, kimchi, radish kimchi, seaweed salad, bean sprouts, fried potatoes. Everything was amazing. The kimchi pancake was nice and crispy and the only thing I would say about it is that it didn't come with a dipping sauce!! I was a bit shocked but can live without it. The chapjae was really, really well done. Probably one of the best I've had actually. I asked for the veggie one but it did have small pieces of meat inside, it wasn't a bit issue with me especially since I was sharing with a meat eater -I just picked them out. Serious high five to the cooks!  The service was GREAT. Our server was a lady who was very bubbly, always had a smile on her face. The manager (I'm assuming, older guy), brought us some of our food and asked how everything was, if we enjoyed the food..etc I've never been checked up on at a Kfood place.   Bathroom was nicely decorated and CLEAN. I always check out the bathroom because I feel like that says a lot about the cleanliness of a place.  Don't let the outside/ the fact that it's in the Dragon City Mall fool you. It's a great place!"}
{"text":"When you order delivery from them, dishes that you get might be inconsistent. I have to remind them not to forget toppings etc. but they always taste great nonetheless. Their pork bone soup is one of the best, house noodle soup has rich chicken broth with very little chicken meat + veggies, and their bibimbab is pretty decent with lots of veggies + sunny side egg. I'm not really a fan of their Kam Pung Gi as it is mostly batter and not the actual chicken meat with expensive price tag. Their Stir-Fried Chicken tastes good but I feel like it's a bit overpriced as well since the quantity is small. You get the actual chicken meat tho. What I love about this place is that they give you multigrain rice and not those plain white rice. Healthy! Overall, they taste great and whenever I crave for Pork bone soup or other Korean dishes, this is pretty much my go-to. A solid Korean restaurant in town.  BTW, it's better to dine- in than get the food delivered because you get to have their side dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place. I always order their seafood tofu stew and pork bone soup. It's one of my go to place to eat Korean food."}
{"text":"I think this is the first of the Owl of Minerva chain of restaurants there are, but please correct me if I am mistaken.  I also think the lady who is the face of Owl of Minerva works here too but I have not asked fearing that it was impolite.  Excellent Korean food and extremely pleasant service.  It may be a little hard to spot from the street but trust me, in its little Nook of the Chinese mall on Dundas and Spadina, you can't get better Korean food.  However, spice levels are not that high and has a very soothing effect on the palette - I recommend the pork bone soup and Kim Chi fried rice for the winters and their spare ribs and cold noodles for the summer.  Alternative if you're looking for spicy, spicy, spicy - read my review on Ka Chi."}
{"text":"They have the most flavored  pork bone soup in town,others all have kind of clear style soup but I prefer my soup have some kind of thickening over slow cooking.Side dish is just ok but the peanut is by far the most unique side dish in town.(actually that's what keep me coming every time)"}
{"text":"Friendly service, nice atmosphere and decent pricing for Korean food.  The food here is good, communication with the server can be tricky, but I love the chap chay and the Kalbi tang. The bulgogi is all right...I find the owl on bloor better.. Their broth taste nicer.   Came here for a quick eat and that's what I got!"}
{"text":"- hidden on the 2nd floor of the dragon city mall, the owl is a gem  - not a great looking place (read: pretty dingy-esque), but i dont care.  - service is good. food is good. (only had he PBS, which is why only 3 stars at the moment)  p.s. they give out yakult (that probiotic yogourt drink) with the bill! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakult"}
{"text":"This restaurant is well known for its pork bone soup, and is frequented by Asians living in the North York area. I was a fan of the pork bone soup, but from my experiences, nothing else is worth mentioning on the menu. Further, the restaurant isn't very clean (floors, tables, chairs, and menus are a bit sticky), even in comparison to other inexpensive Korean restaurants (e.g. Buk Chang Dong, which is located across the street, is far cleaner)."}
{"text":"Pretty good Korean food in a dimly-lit second-floor windowless part of a boring Chinatown shopping mall. Not quiet when crowded, but when semi-empty, the K-Pop or soap operas are playing. Food was good, normal Korean diner fare, served quickly enough, and the prices were fine (not super cheap, but not expensive for what you get).The owner has several restaurants in the GTA, but I've only been to this one. If you're in Chinatown and don't feel like the regular chow, this place is a good option for authentic, fill-you-up Korean, with lovely warm dishes to satisfy on the rainiest of days.."}
{"text":"I'm so glad to find this place. It was delicious. I had quite a few dishes shared amongst friends.  Bulgogi, spicy chicken, chap chae, pork bone soup and all the side dishes . I love that this place is open till 4am on the weekend. My new fave ;)"}
{"text":"Torontos cold weather in the winter season always got me craving something hot! Can to this Korean place because it was suggested by family to try the \"pork bone soup\".   I ordered 2 dishes the pork bone soup and the seafood tofu soup. The pork bone soup was not bad the meat just came off the bone and you can tell that it has been slow cooking for more than a day, it was seasoned well and spice level was just right. The seafood tofu soup looked spicy but the bite did not do justice as it wasn't as spicy as it looked.   The atmosphere needs a little work because the tables and furniture and chairs looked outdated. I would def come back for the soup though!"}
{"text":"I recently wen there. I ordered the Soon Tofu and my cousin had the Japchae I was impressed with the meal more impressed than Ka- Chi which for the price is over-rated.  Owners were very pleasant and helpful. I would go back and like to try the K-BBQ."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd Owl Of Minerva I have visited. So I am a bit biased as I liked the food on the one location up on Korea Town. So although I found this location far more restaurant-like, I have to say I found the food at the other Minerva to be a bit better.  Either way, as most people now know, you do not come to places like Owl of Minerva for the decour, otherwise you will be very much disappointed.    Now why the low rating? Well, the quality of the pork was by far the worst I have had and I have had a lot. The biggest issue was the pork was undercooked. Not that it was raw, but the meat has/should come off the bone in properly prepared PBS. However on both soups that got ordered we had to literally had to struggle to get to our meat. Which means the soup was rushed and toss to customers way before it was done. That is just badly made pork bone soup. Period. Specially for a place that specifically prides itself in its PBS? There is no going around it. Badly played.   I was really disappointed. Now, having said that I might be back again if other restaurants are busy or it is raining or there is a flood and I need to get to high ground and enjoy a pork bone soup after I have climbed my way up.   Sadly, I won't be coming back to this place in the nearby future. ."}
{"text":"Great late night eats spot in Korea town. Nothing like a pork bone soup to wash down the alcohol with. I've also eaten here during regular meal times and it's just as satisfying."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for dinner service with my girlfriend. I have been to an Owl restaurant previously (@ Waterloo), and I have to say that tonight's service was better than the previous occasion.   We ordered the seafood pancake and the pork and sausage hotpot. The food was quickly served but tasted extremely delicious. The banchan was also delightful."}
{"text":"After happy hour Karaoke, this was a nice place to come eat and not have to brave the cold winds outside the mall.   They've expanded the last time I've been here, and the open space is nice.   We were greeted by the owner and he was very friendly.   They don't just serve Pork Bone Soup here. There's also BimBimbap and Bulgoli, Japchae with rice ($8.99), Ramuen, Handmade Noodles, and Korean BBQ.   Lots of fixings also comes with your meal.  Today I had a hearty Pork Bone Soup which was so filling and yummy."}
{"text":"it is not bad? but nothing special. I will give 3 stars which means normal. The porkbone soup is the most recommended one. Most other food is on average taste compared to other Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"The Pork Bone Soup is as good as everyone says it is. Large pieces of pork bone and potato were submerged in a spicy broth served with a bowl of rice. Don't forget to suck the marrow-y bits out of the bone!  The other dishes we had weren't as good. The Cold Spicy Noodles were forgettable, and the Cold Noodles in Ginseng and Soy Soup sounded great, but didn't taste like ginseng or soy-- more like noodles in watery skim milk.  Service was friendly. The banchan is complimentary and refilled upon request, but they no longer serve the yogurt drink for dessert-- although, the free wi-fi inside Dragon City Mall makes up for that!"}
{"text":"This place really should be called Owl of Micki as I would so love to have this owl all to myself.   First off - wow pork bone soup! Could you be any better? Me thinks not. This soup is so full of spice, flavour, oh and pork! I am a huge fan of Korean flavours as they are so different for many western palates. Owl really does it right - the kimchi and other sides you get complimentary with your meals tasted just like when my Korean friends cook for me at home.   I can't wait to return for their bibimbop and cold noodle bowls - I can practically hear that Owl hooting at me now saying come for a midnight snack because you know I'm open late!   Good service, good Korean pop TV, spectacular food!"}
{"text":"I just love this place, worth a visit when you are in Toronto. The food are authentic and warm you up."}
{"text":"Cheap food, great value, great nutrition  \"Loved your tip, give us more!\" OK Yelp.  What the tip said. The prices are very low and the food is very nutritious and plentiful. Oh, and the staff were very attentive and efficient."}
{"text":"I'm not terribly familiar with Korean food. The only things I know how to order are pork bone soup, and kimchi. Big surprise thats what I ended up ordering!  I was worried it would be hard to find this place on Spadina after reading a couple reviews describing so. Turns out its really EASY. Go into the Dragon mall, go upstairs and there it is. It was around 8pm on a weekday when I went, there was one other table occupied.   1. Atmosphere: its clean. There were a couple flat screen tvs playing loudly some type of asian pop-music talent show...it was a little annoying to listen to after awhile.  2. Food: so yes, I ordered the pork bone soup, thinking it looked like the healthiest item on the menu (for those who have had pork bone soup before, you may well be aware its not that healthy, its just the fat has all liquefied into the broth, so you cant see it). Regardless, it was very, very yummy! I actually like taking the little slivers of meat off the bones, its like a tasty reward for the hard work of finding those pieces. Also good exercise in using chopsticks.  I should mention along with the soup, we were served some pickled appetizers. Most of which was very tasty. I will say the kimchi was disappointing, it wasnt fresh.   3. Service: its really good. My brother suspected the person serving us was the same woman as who's image is on the menu...but I wasnt sure. Whoever she was, she was really nice. It took maybe 5minutes to get our food after ordered, and she came over a couple times to make sure we were enjoying our meals. At the end, my brother wanted to take his food home. On our way out, she noticed the bag he had tied around his take out container was awkwardly done, and stopped us so she could fix the container properly inside and re-tie. Oh how cute."}
{"text":"After months of kinda-sorta fearing this place and its enormous smiling-lady sign, we gave it a whirl.  Gotta say, although merely \"a-ok\" and not a smash hit, we were pleasantly surprised and will likely return.  As others have noted the decor is shabby diner, with the added cache of two rather large flat screen tvs -- glory of glories, they were playing some kind of K-Pop music and dance competition that was non-stop candied entertainment.  I'd kinda forgotten just how hilariously awesome that stuff is!  Anyway, as for the food -- cheap ramen noodles gussied up with fresh vegetables makes for a nice snack or light meal, the banchan was good but not great (and bottomless), and my soon tofu would have been 5 star had it not been entirely too salty.  Ease off on the soy, and they'd be competing for top-tier marks!  The menu is pretty extensive, with helpful pictures for the uninitiated pasted on the walls of the restaurant itself.  I tried asking about a dish I wasn't familiar with and unfortunately didn't understand the explanation.  C'est la vie.  I'll give it a try if I'm feeling more adventurous next time.  Finally, just as a note for diners everywhere:  when you're eating Korean and the nice server asks you if you want more banchan / appetizers, that typically means \"complimentary\" and they're happy for you to partake.  It also means you're an absolute douche bag if you leave a crappy tip.  So reciprocate the generosity, yeah?"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to the Owl of Minerva. I've got to say this place is cute as a button. There are TV screens playing korean pop music which kind of adds to the experience. The service is kind and friendly. We both ordered a beer which they serve in an insulated frozen mug. It stays cold throughout your entire meal.. nice.   This time I ordered the spicy cold noodle and my friend had the pork bone soup. The spicy noodle also known as bibim naeng myun which is a chewy buckwheat noodle with shredded cucumber, pear, daikon, apple, sliced beef, hard boiled egg, and miso chili paste (kochu jang). It was so delicious and quite a large portion.  My friend had the pork soup which I ordered on my first visit. We're both used to the taste of the pork bone soup at Ka Chi on Bloor , this one is just as good, in a different way. Although my friend said she missed the bean sprouts. This one has a nummy black pepper topping.  There are so many items on the menu that I want to try.  I'll be returning repeatedly. Not only is the food delicious, it's healthy and reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss with service staff. I think it is under new mamangement. If you get the korean ajumas they are quick on their feet. If you get the guy, then just go somewhere else my opinion! The food here is pretty good usually opt for Kalibi or the pork bone soup. They upgraded their side dishes it used to be just 3or4 now its 7-9. Tasty very impressed. The service was quite good on the times i like to go are from 2-4pm or 6-8pm."}
{"text":"one of my favourite restaurants from the owl chain. they are like 100 times better than the richmond hill location. their food is flavourful, the waitresses are quite nice and they have more variety in their banchans (side dishes which is a hell yer)   i usually like to order some kind of soup (pork bone soup is rly good). i tried their spicy cold noodle and it was alright. i usually like to order samgyupsal (pork belly) but they won't allow you to grill it anymore if you just ordered one plate which i feel is pretty dumb. you would have to order at least two plates to grill it yourself -_- ($17.99 each)   but yeah, rly good Korean food y'all should give it a try"}
{"text":"This is where my love for pork bone soup started.   I'm glad that there is one that opened up in Chinatown. This place has a broader menu, as compared to the one in K-town.   The pork bone soup here is really to die for. There is plenty of meat on the bone and potatoes in the spicy broth.  Also tried the spicy chicken on a hot plate. Flavourful and delicious.   Oh, who can forget the side dishes. They're happy to re-fill for you if you want more.  You bet I'll be back to this restaurant. This place is great place to experience Korean comfort food."}
{"text":"Typical Korean food in Chinatown. There is a large selection on their menu - noodles, appetizers, soups, stews, rice, etc. The prices are definitely very reasonable/cheap. I got a bowl of soup with rice cake, wontons, and beef slices for $9.99. Food was seasoned well - not too salty. If you aren't a fan of spicy food, do be forewarned that around 80% of the menu is spicy! Good range of  \"appetizer\" dishes with cucumber, radishes, bean sprouts, kimchi and more. Service was good overall, and the environment was nice, apart from the fact that the TV's were always playing live music concerts of Korean artists, so there wasn't much to see there.  Our table of 4 went for dinner on a Thursday night, and at any given point in the night, there were at most 5 tables there, so it should be relatively easy to find a spot there weeknights. They do only take cash and debit for transactions over $20."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place and was disappointed. The pork bone soup was too salty (they make it a lot better in their North York location), their spicy rice cake dish was way too sweet, and the egg omlette-like roll was unimpressive (they used Spam in the omlette that dominated the dish).   Service was very attentive and top notch but the food was not to my liking. There were a lot of people there when I went so they must be doing something right but the food just did not suit my pallet."}
{"text":"Best pork bone soup in the city! Hands down. LOVE the purple rice. Opens late, very casual ambiance."}
{"text":"This Owl is located in the Dragon Mall building in Chinatown on 2nd floor, and it's not too hard to find. Ambiance is similar to other locations, with TVs playing K-Pop and all that good stuff and the staff was helpful enough. Came here on a Sunday night and ordered my usual (Kamjatang) and my girlfriend ordered the Soy Noodle (called something else on the menu.. it's noodles in a white, soy-based broth served cold) and both were good. Although I've been to many different Korean places in Toronto and throughout the US, I gotta say Owl has one of the best Kamjatangs around (or maybe I am just a sucker for oily and flavorful soups..) and this location serves it up just as well as the North York branch. If you are craving Korean in Chinatown, this is a good option for a quick fix!"}
{"text":"Kam ja tang and bulgogi are my all time favourite here. So delicious and definitely worth it. Their food are so good because the feel of home cooked food is there. Love love love."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend evening for pork bone soup and bibimbap. The food was average and I much prefer Kachi which is just down the street. Not sure if it was an off night or not because the first time I came to this location I actually thought it was quite good. They were very fast with the orders and the side dishes are always great!"}
{"text":"Food was good. But the service was really bad. The waitress, fat young woman was very rude. Pushing to give her tips. Never back to that place again."}
{"text":"We came here on a snow day and it was pretty empty inside so service was prompt. Compared to other korean restaurants, I would say this place is average, nothing really puts it above any other korean restaurant you can find."}
{"text":"The owl has always been great in my books, I usually always get the pork bone soup, with a side order of the Kalbi beef short ribs. This place is meh I prefer the bloor street location or even the Yonge and finch one. They always open late this one closes by 2, actually the other ones are 24hr. Really disliked the rude waiter here. Asked for extra napkins and gives me a dirty look? Wtf is your problem. You'll be stuck serving people for life with that kind snobby attitude."}
{"text":"Porkbone soup here is better than most places I've been to in the past. Service is quick and courteous and they even offered us complimentary Yakult yogurt drink after our meal. Great value for your money. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Very pleasant and cheap Korean food.  Bulgogi and spicy squid were both very good.  Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"2.5stars.Didn't have much expectations since of the owls I've been to were kinda disappointing. Nothing really special just thought I'd give this location a chance. The place is very old and look like it went through a flood. The menu was so so since it didn't have some of the most popular dishes other places had. The only reason I gave it a 2.5 was because of the soup base for the pork bone soup I ordered. It was a bit better then the one I've been to before. Not much else I have to say except I won't bother with this place again unless I'm desperately craving and no other Korean place is near."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend usually go to the Waterloo branch and I definitely prefer this location over the one in Waterloo. There is a wider selection of food, the food is tastier and they serve brown rice (which is healthier!). Our server was great. She was friendly and asked if we wanted more side dishes (not a lot of Korean restaurants do that). The price is rather normal for the food served.  I would come back here again. I recommend the tofu kimchi (stir-fried with pork and kimchi). It is one my favorite dishes at Owl's."}
{"text":"The Owl is one of those places that I initially had no expectation, but it kind of blew me away.   First, it's inside of a \"mall\" and is located on the second floor of said \"mall\". It's in the corner and easily missed. The inside is small and nothing to be desired. I kept telling myself, \"I hope this is worth it\". It was warm inside and I remember this vividly because they provided you with small glasses of water, but not really enough to keep you cool.  So then we order. I ordered an appetizer of gyoza and the stir fry beef.  Before the meals come out they bring you four small dishes. One was kimchi, I know for sure. The other was some type of vegetable, one I have no idea and the finale was some type of potato with a sweeter sauce. Delicious. I could have had that for my meal. The other ones were ok, not necessarily bad, but just not my taste.  The gyoza were amazing. The breading was the perfect mix of crunchy and chewy and the pork was piping hot, right out of the fryer.  The stir fry beef was amazing. The marinade had a hint of teriyaki, giving it a sweeter taste to it. It comes served on very, very hot plate and sizzles and pops right in front of you. If you eat too quickly you're sure to burn your mouth.  The onions that come with it are sautéed to perfection as well. And it's under $10 CAD.  Definitely one of the best meals I've had in Toronto and at such an unexpected place! I had no idea I was in for such a treat. You definitely don't come here for the atmosphere, but it doesn't matter because the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place.. It's the worst of all the locations I have been to.   Food was not on par as well as felt that it was more expensive than the other locations.   On the plus side service was better."}
{"text":"It took me a long time to get down to Chinatown to finally try this \"new\" location of Owl. The rareness of good Korean food in this area as well as the restaurant's second floor location makes this something of a hidden jem. When we arrived, the interestingly kidney-shaped dining room was packed with slurpy diners. I went with an order of trusty pork bone soup and my dinner date a rice dish and we were not disappointed.  I think that the complementary yogourt drinks that are served with the bill are meant to help with digestion, but seeing the mess of dishes with all the leftover food pooled together in the collection trolley was enough to conjure images of curdling. I gave the stuff a try nonetheless and realized that tea is more my cup of tea when it comes to digestifs. Good thing the service is super friendly and tea refills rampant."}
{"text":"It seems my udpate from the day after I went has been deleted!!!!!  I got food poisoning all nite long and the following day after I went there!!! I wrote that almost right away to edit my first impression (once I felt better....)  Forget about the food in this place being good!!! It may taste good but can be harmful! I never went back there and never will!! ever never, even if you pay me!  If my update is deleted again, I will simply remove this review from my account!!!"}
{"text":"I was definitely pleasantly surprised as my expectations were very low. I've been to several Owl of Minerva now, and relatively speaking this one was really good. The only downside to this place is that it's slightly more expensive than the ones uptown (or so I've heard).  We got two pork bone soup and one chap jae. The pork bone soup was incredibly flavourful (my friend said less spicy than the one at north york) and the jap chae was good, but a bit heavy on the soy sauce taste. Their ban chan was very tasty and they offered to refill it for you when they see that it's empty. Service is awesome.  My favourite part is the yogurt drink they give at as dessert!  I do warn you though, the soap in their bathroom is so grossly watered down that when you press the pump it splashes all over your shirt..."}
{"text":"Excellent pork bone soup I always come here for that so I couldn't tell you much about the rest but my guest always seem to enjoy as well. Service is quick and a good meal for good price."}
{"text":"I've been to the Owl a handful of times in the past few months.  One thing that really stands out each time I eat here is the service.  Everyone I've encountered is very friendly and helpful.  As a markham resident, I'm used to impersonal waitress service, and this place has always exceeded my expectations.  Foodwise, I usually get Bulgogi, and it comes out FAST, which is nice when you want a quick meal.  My wife usually gets the pork bone soup, which she says is very good..."}
{"text":"I had the bibimbap. It was average. Prices are slightly higher than average. It comes with the korean appetizers, most of which were not to my tastes."}
{"text":"Pork bone soup!  Okay, so I didn't have pork bone soup here since I'm trying to cut down on unhealthy food (but it's sooo delicious), but I did have it at another Owl location. Some of my co-workers ordered it and can attest to its deliciousness.  The waitresses are super busy and will run to get items, but at the expense of ignoring you when you ask to order or when you ask to get the bill. This is the only reason why it gets 3 instead of 4 stars. The food is great. I ordered the dolsot bibimbap (labeled hot stone bowl, $7 lunch special) and it met my expectations. I was supposed to get a pop with the lunch special, according to the menu, but didn't. We ordered one bibimbap to go and it came with a pop (and the usual appetizers, like kimchi).  For those who paid attention, yes I think tea and beef on rice is healthier than pork bone soup :)  Update: I came back for the pork bone soup and was sufficiently unimpressed. There just wasn't a lot of meat, which is really the only reason to get it."}
{"text":"Not all the chain restaurants serve the same menu.  This restaurant located in CHINA TOWN, has the worst food than other locations.  The side dishes tasted somewhat old, and everything was DAMN salty!! I wondered why there are no customers at lunch time.   The amount of food is so small that its almost half size of food served in other location.   Also, in the hot weather, it has no air conditioning, when the North York location has cool temperature.  Im never going back."}
{"text":"We were a group of 6 people so we decided to go try out many of their dishes. We ordered soybean cold noodle (Kongguksu), spicy tofu stew (Haemul Soondubu jjigae), kimchi fried rice and a BBQ order of marinated samgyeopsal and L.A beef ribs.  The side dishes was all right. I never tasted Kongguksu so I don't really know what I was to expect in term of the taste, the texture, etc. Personally, I did not like it. It was bland and the texture of the noodle felt like it was overcooked. I expected it to come as a cold dish, but it was instead kind of warm-ish.  The Soondubu jjigae was ok. I tasted better. The Kimchi fried rice was REALLY good in my opinion.  As for the BBQ order, it was a HUGE disappointment. I went to a lot of korean BBQ and never have they served the meat cooked unless the restaurant gave it as an option. This place was the first that I experienced that served us half cooked L.A ribs and already cooked pork. (And we did not order it cooked for sure) I mean.. what's the point of opening our BBQ table if it was to cook the meat for a few minutes?   As for the service itself...it was ok. We were given the side dishes and plates at the same time the food came which is not a big deal. Our waiter looked pretty confused and stressed so I think he might be new.     Bottom line, I will never return to this place."}
{"text":"Summary: Cheap lunch special, decent Korean food Recommend: if you are in Chinatown and you want to have cheap Korean food  I went to this place a couple of times for lunch. It got a good lunch special. For $9, I can get a dish like pork bone soup or seafood tofu soup. Both dishes are very tasty. The owner is pretty generous with side dishes as well. They also got brown rice option. The option is really big that is hard for me to finish. I think dining in would have better value than take out. The takeout does not include all the side dishes."}
