{"text":"Restaurant inside hotel. Breakfast included with amenities was great. Potatoes are excellent and coffee is topped up frequently (and free)! I got the bagel matinale both days with ham. Bread wasn't too doughy and it comes with mayo packets (but I ate it plain to save calories). Fruit is consistently really fresh. Portions are huge. Waitresses lovely. Would go back."}
{"text":"My 12 year old said that it was the best chicken fingers she's ever had. My lasagna was also easily in the top 3. Fantastic place. I'd write more but I am so full I can barely breathe."}
{"text":"J'adore leur comptoir dans le mail Champlain. Les employes sont accueillant, le service etait rapide et le qualite etait la meme que dans le restaurant."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located inside the hotel, no signage outside to tell people is there. Its a nice place and the hotel amenities complement the restaurant. The food was well prepared and was freshly made. Prices are normal, nothing fancy like in old Montreal and food amount is plenty. I had the penne Mediterranean with chicken and it was great. The table bread is super juicy and warm. They serve breakfast until 2:30 in the afternoon. They close at 2:30 and return at 5pm. Not sure why...

My friends ordered omelettes and they looked great and no complaints...

It was the first time.
They speak French - English - Spanish - Portuguese to help anyone that needs help with the menu.

Decor.. Bland, its just a hotel restaurant.

No negatives but it was not a 5"}
