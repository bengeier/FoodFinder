{"text":"Completely unique and really outstanding. Contemporary Canadian cuisine with Japanese and kaiseki influences unmistakably apparent in the attention  to seasonality, presentation, subtly of flavours, attentive service and d√©cor. On the edge of a lovely heritage village so take a walk afterwards. We cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"We live in the area and noticed that this spot recently opened up recently so decided to check it out. This is my first encounter with a tasting menu, and it was beyond expectations. Every item on the menu was very different from anything I have experienced before, and it was kinda cool to see the chefs prepare the food (looks like a lot of work btw). The staffs were also really friendly. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"A group of us decided to check out this restaurant's food since they recently opened in the area. This restaurant is mainly a tasting menu with some bar snacks on the side. There are two choices to choose from -- one consisting of a 9 course tasting menu, and another with 6 courses.

The food was beautifully presented and tasted amazing. Our favourite was the tendon dish, but the other dishes were fabulous as well. 

As for the ambiance, it was cozy and intimate. The waiter was very friendly and made our group feel very comfortable."}
