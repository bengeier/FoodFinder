{"text":"Had lunch with our family today. Buffet food was outstanding! Service was excellent!! Highly recommend it. Our family will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a weekend and they charged us $15 for the buffet. The food isn't worth the price. There was only one starter and the vegetarian options weren't good."}
{"text":"Excellent food, especially the chicken tikka masala. I have been there three times past month , the only reservation is the tandoori chicken flucates with taste I think with different cooks. The taste is very good when they I think steam the chicken. Good people work there also."}
{"text":"Truly exceptional entry into the Indian Cuisine Restaurants in the Scottsdale and Phoenix metro area.  Conveniently located at the 101 and Shea, it's an easy drive, and well worth the cost of the outstanding buffet lunch.  Unlike some competitors, each dish is freshly prepared every day - no leftovers from the day before.  That results in magnificent freshness and flavor.  If you enjoy great, authentic, Indian cuisine, this must be on your \"must try\" list if you haven't already discovered it.  For those reviewers giving anything other than 5 star rating - if not here - then where do you recommend?"}
{"text":"Went here based on the reviews from yelp and I have to admit, this place is so good! My boyfriend and I shared 2 dishes, chicken tikka masala and spinach dahl. Excellent flavor. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Good Indian food around scottsdale area i should say. Its not authentic but sure worth the money."}
{"text":"New name; New owner; New menu; and all are great!. We were fans of this restaurant before all of the changes and we are even bigger fans now after unknowingly walking in on the day of their grand opening last weekend.  The décor has been refreshed and table settings have been upgraded into a more elegant place setting, without charging you for it. Sam and his crew are still there to make every guest feel like an old friend and the new owner, Reena, could not have been more gracious and charming as we watched her meet and check on all of her guests throughout dinner. However, getting to what really matters, Mint now has two chefs offering a new menu with the always delicious standard fare plus new signature dishes at very friendly prices.  The food was exceptional and I now recommend the mango curry tilapia which was amazing paired with the all too generous pour of their quality house chard.  Can't wait to go back.  JF."}
{"text":"The dosas are huge and delicious. Vindaloo is hot and spicy. The happy hour goes until 7 and is great. Don't forget to get the mint chutney for your samosas. Yum! Will be back!"}
{"text":"This review will be divided into two  1) for those new to Indian food (or only tried Indian cuisine,in AZ, at Tandoori times/ Dhaba/ Jewel of the Crown ) 2) and for people of indian origin or connoisseurs of Indian food   1) This is a great place to try the true range of indian food in scottsdale- something that is not the chicken tikka/tandoori/naan that is the cliched norm. Most restaurants here feature food from North india, Mint has chefs from southern india where the food has more of a coconut base, use steaming as a go to cooking method and use a lot of healthy lentils to make the carb part of your meal. There are flavorful options here for committed vegetarians, vegans and gluten free diet followers. My 4 year old has food allergies of gluten, diary and egg. My go to gluten free food for my daughter is Idli (a fluffy, steamed, ground rice cake) but I seldom order it from restaurants because they add gluten to it to keep them longer, but this one is was perfect and they were very accommodating to the requests. Try the different curry options that are not found in other indian restaurants in Scottsdale. They offer wonderful fusion alcoholic beverages that will be exciting for those not used to the kick from spices with your drink! Also if you are a fan of the mule or mojitos this is a great place to try different takes on that.  2) This is some seriously good food!!! I mean they use curry leaves and spices like my grandmother does! There are rare items here like the Porrotta (a very flaky and true kerala/ceylon style) which is pretty tough to make. They have dosa and mutton under the same roof and they do 100% justice to both- no compromises on taste or flavor. Most importantly this place has fantastic variation, very polite staff, superb mojitos (curry or cucumber infused and many other alcoholic fusions that should have a page dedicated to just that) i mean talk about spicy alcoholic drinks!!, My 4 yr old had wonderful fresh idlis, veg biriyani served in an earthen pot, and a wonderful chat with the server all in one meal. we tasted just the chutneys that accompanied my daughters idli and ordered so much food we had to box it! each one better than the next. Now here is the tricky part- we are so used to indian food in Arizona being north indian but for once there is a great south indian style non- vegetarian restaurant, not located in chandler, and serves equally good vegetarian food, dosas and chaat- boon to those of us indians living in scottsdale.  Places like these tend to open and disappear after a while because of lack of advertising or word of mouth. I found this as a quick option on yelp but was shocked once I was there. Why had I not heard about this when I drive by here every day!?  So being a lazy reviewer (and never for food i could cook myself;) - I had to speak up here cause this.was.awesome."}
{"text":"I like to visit Indian restaurants whenever I can, and this is one of the best.  The food is a little on the spicier side (which I love), and has a South India flare - the dishes are definitely not what you would find at your usual Indian Buffet.  Plenty of vegetarian and non-vegetarian choices, too. This is one of my favorite places, I highly recommend the lunch buffet.  New ownership has improved both the menu and the resturant/ambiance as well.  Five stars."}
{"text":"We had a very good time at The Mint.  The food was very good.  The dessert was delicious.  Our waiter Chandrashekhar was very friendly and quick.  My little boy loved the mango lassi.  The manager came by to ask how we liked everything.  I highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here today for lunch, and it was my first time having Indian food. He had been here before and recommended it, so I agreed and was pleasantly surprised!   First of all, the service was Goldilocks level - just right. The restaurant employees were always there if you needed them - pouring water, taking away used plates, et cetera. One of them, upon hearing me say that I cannot handle too much spice, even helpfully walked over with me to the buffet and pointed out dishes they had which were not spicy, as well as accompanying sauces. They all had big, welcoming smiles on their faces and seemed genuinely happy to see us and welcome us to their establishment! Although their presence was always known, they were not overbearing in any way, shape, or form. They were calm, serene, and happy.  Next, the food, which was *outstanding!* For my first time having Indian food, I was pleasantly surprised! Although the first time I filled up my plate I found the food had a tad bit more spice than I would have liked, I found that the amount of flavor made the spice level tolerable! Though, the next time I went up, I stuck with the non-spicy breads and these delicious little balls of fried potato in a delectable sauce - I forget what they were called! The chai tea and strawberry smoothie were also delicious. I'm sure we'll be back soon! The quality and quantity of the food is well worth the money."}
{"text":"Yes. 1 star. And that too just for the clean cutlery and plates. It has nothing to do with Taste.  We saw that this restaurant opened recently so wanted to try it. But highly disappointed.  First of all, for the 10.99 or so lunch buffet that it serves, there are hardly any options for vegetarians compared to other restaurants. Even the general things like a mint chutney with appetizer, pickles with yogurt rice were also missing.  Coming to taste, either things were too spicy or too watery :(.   I really hope the taste improves in this restaurant but atleast in the near future, I am not visiting it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is super chic, has great service and (best of all) delicious food. I love Indian food and am a vegetarian, while my boyfriend is most definitely a meat eater, and we both left with nothing but great things to say. We ordered naan, chicken biryani, the butter tikka masala, and gulab jamun and it was all super tasty. Even the cinnamon cocktail and masala chai we ordered was delicious. All of the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was very enjoyable. I've already recommended it to a friend, and will certainly be going back.  EDIT: I forgot to mention that they gave me an extra, full container of rice to bring home with my leftovers (without me asking for it) so I basically had an an entire meal left over. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food.  We had veggie somosas, chicken tikka masala and aloo gobi for dinner.  The service was efficient and friendly.  The food was extavaganltly phenomenal.  Best Indian food I have eaten in a long while.  This is a must-go for Indian food."}
{"text":"If you want to get sick this is the best place to go and eat .. It's with kariakudi earlier they screwed up and now it become mint ... The food alway gives you trouble after eating ... Previously cooked food and lot of chances of get sick ... I and my family hospitalized and recently one of my friend also got sick"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Mint Indian Cuisine since their grand opening.  We have gone almost weekly since then.  Our favorite server Sam greets us with a laugh and a joke.  We always look forward to seeing him when we're there.  The restaurant is clean and well kept.  Most importantly, the food is excellent!  It is packed with flavor and freshness.  It is prepared daily, so you know you're getting it fresh on your plate each time.  While we're eating, the only sounds coming from us are OOO and AHHHH!  Keep up the good work, Mint Indian Cuisine.  If you're looking for great Indian food, go to Mint!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place from the days it was called \"kariakudi cafe\" and a huge fan of their dosa. But lately the service sucks. We were waiting for someone to take our order for 15mins, a lady showed up and when we told her we have been waiting for long she did not even bother to apologize. She was extremely rude. Very very very rude people. But I have to give a shout out to one of the servers - Chandru. It's for his hospitality that I might think of going to this place again only if you are desperate for a dosa and have no choice. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Very good Indian food. The service is very good. Wait wasn't long. We were a party of about 10 adults. Even though the order was pretty exhaustive, the food was served on time. The best part, special care and attention was given to kids! Will come back again for sure! Cheers."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant i have been to. Poor and rude service and even worse food and selection. I would not even think off visiting this again. Friends, stay away from this place."}
{"text":"So our favorite family Indian restaurant closed a few months ago and we were craving some Indian buffet on a weekend and decided to try Mint. The food was not fresh.....salad wilted, Naan under buffet heat???  Not made fresh and brought to your table. Tons of bones in the chicken biryani and overall not very tasty.   But unfortunately, that wasn't the worst part. Waited 15 minutes for the check.....there were 4 adult buffets, 2 children buffets and a \"Service charge for $14.00.\"  I questioned the server and she couldn't answer why that was added. The owner came out and said it was a charge the computer added for over 5 people. WE had 6.  What the????  I get my own food at a buffet and your gonna charge me a service fee???  PLEASE.....do yourself a favor, DONT GO TO THIS SORRY EXCUSE FOR A RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"I've had plenty of Indian food but never had chicken tikka masala with tough stringy weird texture in several of the pieces. Given that they give you only 6-8 pieces this makes a difference. Not to mention the yuk factor as to maybe the chicken wasn't cooked properly? I didn't get sick so that's the good news."}
{"text":"Chance drop in on Friday for dinner. A great find!!  Excellent curry and chicken saag. Serving staff is very friendly. Portions are generous and prices are reasonable.   Atmosphere is much more sophisticated than one can anticipate from the outside.  We definitely will return!!"}
{"text":"I could not wait to get the check and leave. What kind of Indian Buffet doesn't have Tandoori chicken?  This one... first and last time eating here. The food was poorly presented and mediocre at best. The wait staff were pensive and difficult to understand. The overall dining experience was most unsatisfying. I highly recommend NOT going there. Uggh... I don't know who in the hell would give this place 5 stars. This place sucks..."}
{"text":"Awful service. Maybe I'm confused but I placed a take-out order here under the impression that it was a restaurant. Like where I ask for food and they make it and I pay for it and leave. I called in and laboriously chipped away at a daunting language barrier to get my order in until someone else took over the call who demonstrated marginally higher English language proficiency. Once the order was confirmed, he told me it would be ready in 30-45 min. No problem. I went in 40 minutes later and one of the gentlemen behind the bar told me it would be at least ANOTHER 45 minutes until the food was ready. They hadn't even started making it yet. Then he pointed to three other groups of in-restaurant diners and told me they had all been waiting a long time and they were all ahead of me in the queue. By my estimate the restaurant was only at about 15% capacity, and yet the staff were already completely overwhelmed, and the restaurant had only been open for an hour. I'm not in the restaurant business,  but I say that any restaurant that reaches catastrophic system failure at 3 tables and a take-out order an hour after opening probably didn't want to survive in the first place. They have decent food here (nothing exceptional), but there are way too many higher quality restaurants in the area for us to subject ourselves to hours of terrible service and caloric depletion to get what they're (sometimes/eventually) serving."}
{"text":"Food was bland ( buffet ).  What's worse was the glass that I was served water in  smelled horrible. I see lacking professionalism."}
{"text":"We love this place!  We had the Mushroom Mutter, the Paneer Butter Masala and the Mutter Paneer and enjoyed all three.  I always have rice pudding and their's is one of the best I've had.  The happy hour drinks are great and only $5.00, we get the lemon drops that are fantastic."}
{"text":"BLACK HAIR IN MY FOOD Yuck! No need for me to go on about any review! So grossed out!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great buffet at a reasonable price with all the Indian favorites and some surprises, too. Best Tandoori Chicken I've ever had. Glassware was clean and the water tasted fine."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried the lunch buffet here, you're missing out. The quality is top notch and the service is wonderful. The choices are vegetarian and non-veg and the chicken tikka masala is good enough itself to make a trip here. All you can eat, including naan and desserts. Some of the best Indian food in the Valley!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best North & South Indian foods in the Scottsdale. I especially enjoy the chicken dishes. After the new owners took over this place it has improved a lot. The new owners do care about restaurant and especially their customers."}
{"text":"I got tired of their repeating menu on the buffet. Also during their weekdays buffet items are not many as they offer lesser price compared to the weekend."}
{"text":"Great quality Indian food .. simple dishes cooked well. Nice ambiance , clean and well managed. This is unlike other Indian food places in valley like which are filled with chaos, horrible ambiance and focus on quantity over quality. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"The food made me sick we ate there for lunch. It was delicious but I was throwing up all day! I had a migraine that would not go away until 10pm. I fell asleep for hours. I wonder what did they put in the food. If you want to enjoy Indian Food  dont go to any buffet go to a restaurant that makes it fresh! Eventhough its a very nice restaurant I do not recommend going to this place because of how I felt."}
{"text":"Went for the afternoon buffet during the weekend.  It was more than 30 min before the buffet closing time and several items were depleted and not filled despite 20+ customers in the restaurant still eating.  Service was non existent and you have to look for people to fill your water glass or ask for napkins.  Food quality is very mediocre and most of the items in the buffet were lukewarm to barely warm.  Quality of food is so so as well.  Whatever they add in the food was making your stomach go all gassy and bloated in a couple of hrs.  Overall, a below average dining experience and food quality.  Plenty of other Indian buffets in the valley which have better service and better quality of food for lower price than Mint.  Not sure how the dinner experience is in this place but the buffet experience put me off not to come back here again."}
{"text":"This place is great! They feature a large array of menu selections to choose from on the buffet line. The restaurant has a nice contemporary theme, and is clean. I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to indulge in some good Indian food. You know a restaurant is good when the people of the culture are eating at it."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant lovely with very friendly staff and authentic South Indian food. With my experience at eating in Indian restaurants in US soil(which is many) I have picked up the knack to choose the dishes based of the staff/cook.  As I realized the staff is from south I made a conscious effort to order accordingly and the dishes turned out great.. below is the gist of experience. Best dishes: Dosa, sambhar, rasam, biryani  Authenticity: 9/10 Service: 9/10( they are a little easy during lunch buffet, at dinner you feel as though you are eating at your grandma's place) Hygiene:8/10 Ambience: 8/10 *Tip: for dinner they have some attractive offers such as buy one dosa get one free on Tuesdays"}
{"text":"Went here today for dinner. The lassi tasted very bad... Rest of the food was all right."}
{"text":"We went here on a Thursday night (05-12-16) and asked one of the waiter's  who happened to be outside on a break if they had a clay tandoori oven. He said they purchased one 30 days ago. My requirement for any good Indian restaurant is that they must have a clay oven. When we went inside they were having issues with their A/C. Since the A/C wasn't working we decided to order (Medium) Chicken Tikka Marsala and some Garlic Naan to go. They gave us a free Apple-Seven up cocktail while we were waiting and it was extremely refreshing. When we got back home we enjoyed the food very much. The chicken was very tender and the seasoned Marsala was mouth watering. What a great find for a Thursday night. The sign out front said that the restaurant was under new management. If we lived in Scottsdale we would certainly be back trying more of the menu."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I live in LA and Indian restaurants are a dime a dozen. Mint is unique and the quality is excellent. Lamb cooked to perfection and drool-able curries with superb flavor. YUMMMM. Now if only they'd open one up in my neighborhood...."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food i have ever had in a restaurant !! I would recommend everyone come here. The service was great I never needed for anything. Come and see for yourself :)"}
{"text":"Great food, nice ambience and quick service, if that's what you want go ahead that's the place for you, I would have given 4 star as quantity served is little less, other than that perfect place for dinner."}
{"text":"This is definitely one the biggest and most incredible and best Indian lunch buffets I have ever been to with Northern and Southern dishes.  Incredible assortment of dishes and chutneys in a beautiful environment."}
{"text":"Quality Indian restaurant that serves buffet lunch and order dinner. Buffet has all the staples and Tikka masala is tasty. Reasonably priced. Also have had the chicken curry and it was good."}
{"text":"No other Indian restaurant in Arizona has matched the Mint Indian Cuisine. This North and South Indian Cuisine has such flavorful dishes. The simple, yet a classic, chicken tikka masala and garlic naan are some of my favorites. You can pick your level of spiciness. Their masala dosa (essentially a giant crepe with potatoes inside) is also pretty impressive. I also recommend their mango lassi, a yogurt based drink. Filled to the rim, their wine is the best deal of all during the happy hours.   Side Note:  - I've been here for their lunch buffet and it's not nearly as good as their dinner.  - If you spend more than a certain amount and use cash, you can get a discount.  - The crooked picture on the wall drives me nuts."}
{"text":"Happy to have visited for lunch Buffett twice.   Wide variety, hot and tasty.  As always, more choices than you should eat.  The selection is wonderful.  The only way to go."}
{"text":"Best buffet I've had so far ..trust me I've tried Indian buffets all over Usa ! Owner is nice and cares about the customers. Tuesday- Thursday it's 12$. Friday's it's 13$ and Saturday -Sunday is 15$.   Again I'm not saying it's anywhere close to the food I've eaten in India !! ( for people who've visited/ lived in Delhi/ Mumbai - places with the best food in the world!! )   They have a little assortment of north and South Indian dishes... so try the idly-sambar- chutney and some butter chicken- naan !!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've had a bad experience.. But it became an unpleasant way to start the new year.  Ugh - the worst thing about a bad experience is when everyone at the table faces a horrible experience that's worse than yours. This very thing happened at Mint.  Us being a party of 6 arrive at this Scottsdale establishment promptly at 7. A nice decor inside with unique artwork.   The list of dishes are a little different here .. For example Bharwan Kofta is essentially malai kofta in an almond base gravy that consists of an overcooked potato spiced balls.  Kofta was okay - not the best. But the meal is not the center of attention here - it's more about the service which created the negative experience. After waiting 45 min a single dish was served and then 15 min later the kofta came out with the naan.  This hit hard when our friends ordered a Mutter Paneer dish and 40 min later they get a Mushroom Paneer.. 40 min later - again a mushroom paneer? Really? What's going on here? Third try - finally get it right.  So word of advice all who order - when you order - make sure you order 3 times before you get something right in your order. These guys can't seem to get it right.  My wife ended up ordering a Masala dosa and was at the restroom few min before arrival. She comes over and finds the dosa cold. When we complain - the waiter tries to convince us that it got cold because she was in the restroom for the three min that she was away at the table. Really? If any of you have ordered any dish fresh at a restaurant - you know it never gets cold in a matter of minutes. That's bull****!! After much convincing, she got her second dosa as expected 30 min later.  While the food that actually came out was tasty - the experience is what ruined our night. So if you feel like you want to go out for an amazing Indian restaurant dinner with rewarding service, then don't expect too much from Mint.   Sadly this won't be a place I'll come back to in the future. Service goes a long way when it comes to customer experience - Mint still leaves a bad taste in my mouth!"}
{"text":"Bland flavor. Too Americanized. Been here twice and both times buffet was horrible. Most of the food was start gone and they didn't make any more even though the buffet didn't close for 1.5 hours."}
{"text":"It is always a good sign when the ethnicity of 90% of the customers matches the ethnicity of the food being served. This was my experience at Mint Indian Cuisine today.   I gave the restaurant a four-star rating for the number of options available on the lunch buffet, the flavor and quality of the food, and the overall customer experience. I was very pleased as well at the number of vegetarian and vegan options on the buffet.  The food was tasty, the staff friendly and helpful and the price reasonable.   While the $11.99 price tag is a little higher than I'd like, the variety of options and quantity of food make it a decent value. If I can have three different flavors for a tad more than I'd pay for one in a non-buffet setting, I see that as a good deal.   I don't see much difference from my previous visits when the restaurant was under a different name, other than the extremely friendly gentleman that greeted me, showed me the buffet and gave me a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"Well I'm not normally one to rate restaurants but....  Critic: Jay Knudson Scale: 1 (worst) to 10 (best)  Visited Mint with 9 other guests. Atmosphere: 7- Clean and quiet enough to hear ourselves. The aromas definitely let you know what you're in for. It's a prelude to your authentic cuisine and gets the mouthwatering started. The crooked art work threw me off so a few pts off there, but waterfalls are cool and giant wine glasses spark conversation. I think the salt and pepper was a formality - not really there for its own use. I think that's thoughtful. Haha Pretty cool to bring a big group as it is a fun place to share foods.  Service: 8- \"Would you like more water?\" they were tentative to our needs and dealt with a crowd that couldn't decide on 2 or 3 samosa plates in a timely manner very well  Food: 8- Eye appeal is what got me. My eyes were bigger than my appetite. Those plates were huge and the chutney dishes were a nicely added touch. They expand the flavors of an already robustly favored dish. And there was definitely an assortment of colors to the food that I don't really always see at the table (bright yellow, green and red everywhere). My chicken vindaloo was a little spicy but overall pretty tasty. Chicken and potatoes are not for everyone but I enjoyed it. And those samosas were awesome! They were freshly made and stuffed with a very tasty filing. The mango lassi tasted like sour cream and mangos. I don't know if that's how they are supposed to taste or what, but it wasn't appealing to me. I won't knock down points though because I don't have a reference for taste. The naan was fun. Garlic and chili naan are your choices and either make a great pair with your meal. The overall freshness of the ingredients could not be identified as most of them were off the shelf, however the chicken cuts were tender and fell apart in my mouth as I anticipated, the chutneys look freshly made, and the chili was fresh enough for me to feel the heat. (spicy) Value: 8: did I walk away feeling satisfied? Yes.   Likeliness to return: Yes- maybe not for dinner though. My stomach grumbled throughout the night as it does with many authentic foods.  Maybe lunch!"}
{"text":"Having been to Mint several times now as a go-to dinner destination when meeting up with other ~Yelp friends~ it's high time I gave my $0.02 about this fine Indian establishment.  I've been to two other Indian places in Phoenix, one in Tempe and another in North Scottsdale. The latter has an excellent buffet (in my opinion the best way to consume Indian food is in massive quantities); I have heard it's better than Mint's, although to be fair I have not tried Mint's buffet. What sets Mint apart to me is the flavor; Indian food is all about the spices and curries, and Mint dishes it out with the best of them.  My favorite dish I've had here is probably the goat vindaloo -- paired with the chili garlic naan and you've got a one way ticket to flavor town. I also like to recommend the classic chicken tikka masala or lamb vindaloo for 'beginners'.   What I'm not so much a fan of are the portions -- for the price (I usually spend ~$20 for dinner) I'd like a bit more meat on those bones, literally; the goat vindaloo, while super flavorful, was 90% bone. You really fill up on naan and rice, but they also only give one small bowl of rice for the whole table, even for a large party. They will give you more, but you have to ask for it."}
{"text":"Great food and service.   Elegant interior.   The chicken tikka and garlic naan were perfect.   I also enjoy their extensive lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Found many good items for vegetarian like dry cauliflower Manchurian, Mysore Masala dosa and mutter paneer with garlic nan."}
{"text":"Ate at the Mint Indian cuisine and really enjoyed the food.  Right spiced, flavorful, with generous portions.  The staff were very friendly and also did not feel rushed with our meal.  Recommend the Lamb Shahi Korma which was delicious.  The veggie Samosas were good but the paneer pikora app was outstanding."}
{"text":"I've read the other reviews. Today I tried Mint because because I just moved here and it's near my house. We love butter chicken and Saag/Palak paneer. I've had a lot of trouble when I've moved finding versions which compare to the one from Palo Alto, CA. This was not the same, but the flavors were delicious and very complex. The take out did take forever, but last I checked Indian Food takes a while. I thought the staff were polite. There were a couple who didn't appear to speak English. Maybe culturally we should forget that this is not a 5 star restaurant and expect that type of service. I find Ethnically Chinese restaurants get bad reviews for service. I'm looking forward to trying other dishes."}
{"text":"nice buffet - with good options for vegeterians"}
{"text":"Mint has an excellent lunch buffet. Delicious chicken tikka Masala or butter chicken is always on the buffet. Naan is included on the buffet and they keep replenishing. Buffet also includes tea found near the bar. Price goes up for lunch on Fridays and weekends but selection does not improve by that much. They are closed on Mondays"}
{"text":"Well we could barely understand the server.. had to have her repeat several times.. no draft beer and beer we had was warm... IPA not good warm! Dinner was ok...ran out of water long time before server returned... will probably stick to Marigold Maison, closer to home, better communication, more welcoming and better beer selection"}
{"text":"Okay so I went back to this place with my family and was amazed how much the food and service has improved since my last visit. The staff was extremely kind and the food was just spot on delicious! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food was ok...  Dessert was nasty....please don't serve canned Gulab jamming... The best part was the tea."}
{"text":"Hi , went there with friend, it was lunch buffet. The Tandori chicken was awfully burnt and the whole food was super tastelessly spicy. They didn't had any lamb dish and fish curry was awful. Very expensive. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"So delicious! The cooking is amazing. One of the best Indian buffets I've ever been to. Bringing my girlfriends here next week! There was tandoori chicken, vindaloo, mushroom curry, coconut chutney. Just amazing naan. I'm sure the menu changes regularly but the mango lassi is so thick and amazing and pairs with the spicy food so well. What a treat!"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed one of the best Indian restaurant meals I've had in the Phoenix area. This restaurant is legit and won't disappoint.  Buffet had two biryanis, and everything was great."}
{"text":"excellent food and service! We go there at least once a month usually for dinner. Buffet is average"}
{"text":"Mint is my go to place when it comes to satisfying my craving for Indian food. I usually get the paneer tikka masala and or the chicken tikka masala. In addition we'll also indulge in their naan which is made in house and bursting with flavor, especially the garlic chili naan. Dine in or take out is great - more than reasonable portions for the price. I also recommend trying the lunch bar during the week. They have a slew of different meals prepared that you can sample from and rest assured you won't be disappointed. Any one of my friends or family that I've brought here raves about the place. If you're in the mood for Indian food go here!"}
{"text":"Very unhygienic place. As soon as we opened the menu, a cockroach ran down the page. Not going back here."}
{"text":"THE BEST INDIAN FOOD IN SCOTTSDALE.   Nice flavors, deep and rich.  The desserts are exceptional.   Drinks are contemporary and delicious.   The service is very friendly and accommodating.  Clean and modern, young ambiance."}
{"text":"Such a shame. This place just changed ownership and the new owners decided to raise their pricing for the exact same food. The lunch buffet used to be comparable to other buffets but not anymore. He is charging $4 more than the previous owner. Food needed to be replenished and was not done in a timely manner. More than 3 trays were consistently empty at the same time. If you expect to raise prices for no reason at all then your service better be on par. Food was ok not great. It's too bad we probably will not return anymore."}
{"text":"Military friendly!  Went there for lunch with my husband because we were in the area. Not only the food is delicious, the service is exceptional as well! Someone instantly bought our lunch and the staff treated us as special guests. Very grateful and humbled!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy going in the evenings when they have a full menu. The food is outstanding, and the servers are incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"I'm giving mint indian just 2 stars based on my experience since they have bought the restaurant from karaikudi palace. I understand when you buy a business the first thing you do is recoup and that means a gradual increase in price. I'll start with the buffet, it's now 15.00 per person Friday thru Sunday, that's more then a dinner entree, I'm not sure they are using halal meat, I did not see the sight above the buffet, the Tuesday thru Thursday charge is now 13.00 dollars per person. The choices are a little different because of a new menu and chef, I was very turned off that they didn't have the traditional rice pudding for dessert, that is a mainstay of an indian buffet. Moving on with recouping, I placed a take out order and asked for some chutneys to go over the phone, when I arrived and got my check, I was charged 3.00 dollars for the 2, 1oz cups. I was a little disturbed about that being that tandoori times down the street would nver do that. To me that's asking for salsa or hot sauce and their should never be a charge for that. The decor has been updated but the service is sub par so it doesn't matter or make a difference, what's missing is Sam and Pandu, they were the face of the restaurant, I would have to say that the service factor has gone down having college students working in a fine dining establishment, not knowing when to approach a table to check in or clear dirty plates during the buffet service. I did notice plates piling up on the table next to us. The last thing I saw and agree with another yelper is the family and friends eating behind the bar, I have my opinion and I'll let all who reads format their own. I'd be happy to go back but they have to figure out a few things to improve/change to be a success"}
{"text":"All I can say is that this restaurant is Amazing! The food was probably the best I've had in AZ. The atmosphere was very nice . The service was great ! I definitely recommend this place !!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and really enjoyed it. A friend recommended this place because she knew there were vegan options. We ordered a few things but the one delicious item was the crepe. The service was pretty decent and the environment was laid back."}
{"text":"Food was good, atmosphere was nice, \"Food service\" was also good... only thing that bothered me was when it was time to pay... We waited 15 minutes before the owner made eye contact with us and we asked for the check, he told the waitress to give us the check and no acknowledgement was made... After 20 minutes the owner looked our way and signaled to the waitress to give us our check which she did. When the credit card was given to the waitress she threw the credit card on the bar and walked to the back to get someone's order, 3 workers picked up the card and threw it back on the bar. My card went into to many hands for my liking. Because of this situation I would not be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I came across this restaurant in Scottsdale.    We came at dinner - great atmosphere, wonderful service and incredible food.   We love Indian food and have enjoyed great Indian restaurants in San Francisco and London and we're so surprised by the Mint in Scottsdale.   If you enjoy Indian food don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  So great to have so many choices, vegetarian and meat.  Also love that dosa and idli are available on the buffet."}
{"text":"First Indian place that I've tried in Phoenix.  Recommended by another Elite. Bit of a drive coming from Gilbert. But totally worth it.  Nice big parking lot outside  Pretty clean on the inside, Indian TV shows playing in the background. Slightly crooked wall picture on purpose  Waiter and waitress were friendly.  I had the tikka masala Lamb. Loved it a lot. Super good. Amazing flavor. Garlic naan in addition was what you should get.  Ate several bowls of rice, as one bowl is not enough.  The naan and the rice with the sauce, I could eat all day.  Totally satisfied after I finished. Only thing I would change, is more meat.   Would come back here again. Come check it out."}
{"text":"Read this review if you want an unbiased opinion from your above average American Foodie/Traveler type.   I'll start by saving some people on here some time. If you are the typical fast paced, want it now, on an agenda type of person then this restaurant isn't for you.   If you are very relaxed, and you will be spending the duration of your meal engaged with the people you eating with and not focused on the precision of the waitstaff then this restaurant is for you.   The best way for me to explain the Mint is to imagine yourself eating in a crowded neighborhood restaurant in New Delphi. Where you are the only foreigner there and the customs of American restaurants weren't used. Picture the imperfect floors, unpolished silverware, no uniform waitstaff, possiblly animals roaming the dining room. Yes, authenticity. This is the Mint. The food is amazing and is some of the best Indian we've ever had. Everything else is 3rd world.   I would eat here again because I know what to expect.  I'm not eating here if I'm in a rush or if I'm already having a bad day. I give it 4 stars because the food was that good and I knew to not expect good service going into it.   A good sign of a great ethnic restaurant is when most of the patrons are of the ethnicity of the establishment your eating in. That is definitely the case here. Bon Apetité"}
{"text":"Ever find yourself craving dosa? Mint is the place you want to be. The dosas here are phenomenal and the best that I have tried anywhere in Arizona. They are cooked to a perfect crunch, the potato inside is extremely flavorful, and the sambar is hearty and perfectly complements the food. I like my food a bit on the spicy side, so I always get a Mysore Masala Dosa at the highest level of spice. It's not insane for those that can handle spice, but will definitely make you drink some extra water.  Now, I know that some people reading this review may not know what a dosa is, but check out my picture. It is a popular South Indian dish comprised of a crispy bread in the same way as a crepe, and filled with delicious spiced potatoes. It is absurdly delicious and will satisfy any appetite. The Mysore Masala Dosa is unique in that the inside of the dosa is lined with some spice as well.  Mint also has an incredible happy hour and they fill their wine glasses to the top! So you really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"The Mint Indian Restaurant is a great find for the valley. There are a few curry restaurants but they seem to fade away with time or get too fancy with the food so there is nothing \"indian\" left in the food. This place has been consistent from the beginning and serves the best quality meat i have ever found in curry. The lamb in the biryani is unbelievable quality as well as the rest of the meat dishes. Service is excellent especially since Kojac is back. Hope it lasts but has been packed again the last few times there. New owner is getting it together."}
{"text":"I went there with my husband the food was very good n as well as service by Chandrasekhar.. We really enjoyed. Will be back."}
{"text":"The menu here is quite extensive, but everything sounded great. We ordered the paneer pakora and veg samosa for starters and they were both delicious. Then for the main we ordered the chicken tikki masala and the goat masala with garlic naan. Also excellent. Everything we ate here was amazing and we would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Az! ***** chili chicken and samosas were delicious! Our server Telly Salavas was very personable and fun!! He made our experience very comfortable. We also had the Korma chicken and cheese naan, very delicious. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Lab Seekh kebabs are really excellent.  Paneer Tikka is good  Butter Chicken in Fantastic  Tandoori chicken is tasty as well"}
{"text":"This review is for the lunch buffet. The staff was friendly and the food was very good full of flavor and fresh. The ice tea with the buffet is delicious. It's a quaint smaller restaurant with reasonable prices. The only thing I would say is awkward is reaching for the food in the second row of the buffet. There are tongs available and glass guards to protect the food but you really have to reach to get to the food in the back of the buffet leaving the front food exposed to arms hanging over it. But that won't stop me from going back for lunch."}
{"text":"I went for a weekend buffet. Biggest pet peeve of mine: when weekend buffet is more expensive than weekday buffet! Like really, how much more will I eat on the weekend vs the weekday?? I understand the economics behind it but it is annoying. Okay. Well since I aired that, I will still visit Mint on the weekends if I was in the area (maybe just give the $30 bill for 2 a side eye). Love the variety. My BF is a meat eater unlike myself. He never complains when I drag him to buffets at vegan Indian restaurants but I feel bad for him. So I have been looking for places that have buffets and  both vegans and otherwise. Mint Indian cuisine fits the bill. The food was on the spicy side (a plus for me), a good variety of desserts, and my favorite sambusa (aka samosa). Love that they have dosas for order. Will try some next time."}
{"text":"Location: this is near Shea and the 101, near LifePower yoga kind of in a strip of shops/restaurants.   Parking: easy and plentiful.   This looks a lot more fancier on the inside than on the outside!  The decor was appropriate and interesting, but much more classier than other Indian restaurants, though a few framed pics were kind of off.   Service:  Excellent! The server and others were constantly coming by and very helpful and friendly.    Food: Delicious and plentiful!  I had some red curry and ate almost all of it.  My friend had some kind of lamb; when we left, the server offered some rice with her to-go food."}
{"text":"We were greeted quickly and seated within 1 minute of our arrival (the restaurant was very slow). The staff treated us very nicely from start to finish. Always kept the water full and checked on us a few times. We ordered the samosa which was great. The two sauces that they provided were very tasty and great compliments. We ordered the chicken tikka masala and the chicken kari (both requested spicy). The tikka was mild and the gravy was a bit on the sweet side for us. The kari was mild as well and lacked the pepper flavor we were looking for. The chicken in both dishes were hit and miss. The dark meat was cooked fine but the white meat was inedible. You could not cut it with a fork or bite through it. Was not good! We also ordered naan which met our expectations. We would recommend this restaurant for sure! We believe we had a bad night for chicken is all. It happens and we understand that. Cheers Always!"}
{"text":"Great tasting Indian food! My husband and I were here for dinner on a Friday. Plenty of parking space available outside, and the restaurant was not completely packed (so no waiting time). We ordered Papdi Chat, Medu Vada, Podi Dosa and Veg Hakka Noodles. Flavors were authentic, except the Indo-Chinese noodles tht were a tad bit over cooked. Special mention of the Sambar and chutneys served with the vada and Dosa ... total awesomeness!!! Service was great and the waiter came back to refill water more than once. Ambience was as expected of a good quality Indian restaurant with some nice music and TV to compliment the meal. A good experience! We will surely be going back!"}
{"text":"High quality and consistent food. Good ambiance. Very tasty authentic south indian food"}
{"text":"It will take you some time to review the rather extensive menu but you will not be disappointed with your choices! The best thing is to order a lot and then take home the delicious leftovers. If you don't like spicy, be sure to ask for mild on some of the dishes as you may be in for a surprise. Otherwise, a mouthful of naan bread should help. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I went for the weekend lunch buffet because we love our Indian cuisine.  It was relatively empty when we went in, only another gentleman dining when we arrived.  The ambiance is a little dark for my liking, but the restaurant itself is pretty.  What concerns me a little bit about standing buffets is that if there are no people to eat it, it just sits there all day.  The buffet selection is wonderful -- it has a lot of dishes that you don't find in other Indian buffets, such as soups and fried fish.  I enjoyed everything that I ate.  The food is much better than what I had when this place was Karaikudi Palace.  Their saag paneer is to die for -- I ate plate after plateful, and I also enjoyed the tenderness of their goat curry, and I don't even like the gaminess of goat so much.  The aloo gobi was fantastic, spiced perfectly with a surprising addition of okra -- I LOVE okra.  The naan was soft and fluffy, though I wish they had a garlic naan option.  The chicken curry had a lot of bones in there, to my dismay, as picking them out between bites was not particularly enjoyable.  Their desserts are also delicious; the gulab jamun was warm and sweet, and the halwa was flavorful.  The only thing I missed was a traditional rice pudding.  I have to say that I love the level of spice in these dishes.  I do prefer my food on the hot side, and I could stand for more spiciness, but I do think that what Mint has is perfect for most people.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful -- he asked us if we tried certain dishes and how we enjoyed the food.  I think I swallowed a gulp of spice at one point in one of the soups and started coughing, at which point, he immediately came over to fill my glass, which I thought was kind of him.  Some of the plates were chipped, and while this doesn't really affect my dining experience, I want to make note of it because with the decor so pretty, the chipped plates really don't belong in the dining room.  Another thing I noticed were the owner's family and friends eating from the buffet as well, probably because business was so slow.  This doesn't bother me, and I don't have a strong opinion on this, though I can imagine some diners finding this unprofessional?  The weekend lunch buffet is $15 per person, which I think is a little high for what it was.  Still, I understand since we're in Scottsdale, and everything is a bit more expensive here than in surrounding areas, such as Tempe or Mesa.  I will very likely return for a quick Indian buffet fix, though I do think that there are better values for your dollar elsewhere."}
{"text":"Worst place ever , the food it's testing only fine , but there is no food for a buffet , it's all empty and they don't refill it  , when you ask for it they said it's coming and ofcurse nothing is coming. We asked for a water and we are getting warm water no ice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant that I've been to in Arizona. The staff is always incredibly welcoming and they are very attentive. I've talked to the owner a few times and he always has a warm smile and a joke when we speak.   I took my grandmother here tonight but I've been coming at least twice a month even though it's a 30 min drive from my house.   I typically eat the lunch buffet but dinner was even more spectacular! I only wish they were within walking distance from here. I'd be their most consistent customer. Thanks Mint!"}
{"text":"First time visit. Wow! The lamb saag was really bright and tasty with tender lamb. The tikka masala dish was really flavorful as well.  Enjoyed the garlic naan and ice cream dessert. We'll be back. (Reasonably priced, to boot!).Best Indian food I've had. Great service and nice atmosphere.  Indian folks eat here, too!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a dosa since 1 hr and when ever I ask them they say 5 mins.worst service"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for five years now. It's probably the best Indian food in the valley.  Being a vegetarian I prefer South Indian faire.  Their dosas and idli/sambar are awesome. Their service is exemplary. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place gets a 4 for food and options but only a 1 for service. You have to ask for a clean plate after a messy appetizer and have to flag the waiter down for drink refills. They do have a nice happy hour with lots of food options. You could probably have a full meal just based off the happy hour menu. I would definitely give them a try but have some patience."}
{"text":"I am not a big expert when it comes to Indian food, but went to quite few Indian restaurants. This restaurant was great. We ordered dosa masala and chicken tikki masala. Both dishes were excellent especially chicken one. The meat was very tender, tasty and different. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Everything is excellent. There are lots of varieties on the buffet. I really like the tandoori chicken and gulab jamoon. Ambience is great. Service is very fast. I'll recommend this."}
{"text":"Great south indian food. Came back for the weekend buffet and thats great as well.  A special mention to the servers here. They are the most nicest people you will meet so kind and generous. Chandru leads the way with his amazingly kind attitude and special effort to make guest feel really happy.   4 stars for the food and a top star for customer service. Thanks."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Would not fill buffet items and when asked, waiter said\" that is finished now\". Asked again and was given no answer. Finally agreed to fill empty trays. No welcome upon arrival and waiter pointed a finger\" Go sit on that table\". Will not come back again."}
{"text":"Very yummy traditional Indian.  Nice surroundings and friendly service.  I have the buffet it was a little tired as I got there a half hour before it was over but all in all good Indian cuisine"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Karaikudi. Marvelously rich sauces and a good mix of entrees...chicken, goat, fish. Mint Indian Cuisine seems mostly vegetarian, with dishes struggling to match the complexity of the richer meat sauces. I always cherish Indian food, so look forward to their evolution. Raised price of buffet to $11. Here are some do betters...soup bowls for soup instead of styrofoam  8 oz cups, small spoons for dessert, and at least 4 desserts for a buffet, instead of 2. There was one fruit, but I wouldn't consider a single fruit dessert. Most of the hour plus time I was there, the fish dish was all sauce, fish empty. I asked twice if they could bring out some fish. Maybe an hour later, it arrived. Since I arrived before 1pm, didn't understand why it took so long to replenish the tray. With buffets, I like to try all the dishes. Since it was one of the 3 non-vegetarian, eager to try."}
{"text":"My fiance and I really loved the food at Karaikudi, and were hoping for a similar experience with the changes to \"Mint.\" The prices went up by at least $3 per dish for vegetarian main dishes and several of my favorites are now gone. The samosas were decent, but everything else was somewhat unremarkable. Add to that the fact that the server disappeared after taking our plates and we had to flag someone down to get and pay our bill. I was hoping that the changes would be subtle and it would still be the best place in town for Indian food: not so much. Everyone was very nice, but I can't justify paying more for food that isn't as good and subpar service. We will not be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy Indian food and have been to quite a few Indian restaurants. Mint is, hands down, our favorite Indian restaurant in the Phoenix area. Exceptionally fresh buffet with a wide variety of choices. We'll be back there soon."}
{"text":"Boy Am i glad that i asked the husband to pick up some dinner on his way home from work.  ~Lamb biriyani with ratia and gravy $13.99 ~Chicken 65 $9.99 ~2 portions of garlic naan $5.98  Overall generous portions and a good meal for $32.96  The Biriyani was nice and the lamb cooked to perfection,tender and juicy.The gravy and raita were better than most restaurants.The gravy had banana peppers which is unusual but tasted fine.Chicken 65 was just fried chicken with red onions,not authentic but again above average.The garlic naan/bread was fresh and soft,something most indian restaurants do right.  The reason i give them four stars is because i had pretty low expectations and the Lamb biriyani caught me by surprise.I'm definitely going to try other dishes on the menu to see if they are as consistent or i just got lucky.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Had eaten here several times under its previous ownership and thought we would give it a try.  Worked our way around the \"waterfall\" and someone came from behind the bar to seat us.  Found a number of interesting options on the menu and ordered an appetizer, two entrees and naan.  After fifteen minutes, the waitress came back to tell us that one of the entrees was not available that night.  We selected another.  It didn't take long for us to notice that a door bell chimed every time someone went in our out.  As there was a steady stream of takeout orders, the bell was chiming constantly.  The bell was necessary because one couldn't see the front door from the bar where at one time I counted five employees hanging out.  After waiting forty-five minutes, and being unable to flag down our waitress, I went up to the bar to ask where our food was.  Five minutes later, one of the entrees came out.  Another five minutes and a second one came out.  We were almost done with these when our appetizer came out.  At the one hour mark, our naan arrived.  I would have given this place two stars as the food, once it arrived, was fairly good.  The final straw was when the check came and either the owner or manager asked if we could leave the tip in cash as otherwise, it didn't come to them???  Never heard that one before.  Keep this up and there will be a third owner soon."}
{"text":"Kind of small buffet of tasty dishes from northern India. If you like burayni and rice dishes this is your spot. Nice interior decor with many modern touches. Tables have white tablecloths and are close but broken up so it doesn't seem that close. Not your typical dining hall feel like many indian buffet places. Service average, but it's a buffet at lunch so no big deal."}
{"text":"Went for lunch buffet at 1pm on a Friday.  Place was packed...ate at the bar.  Great selection in the buffet, incl several spicy dishes.  Buffet selections seemed fresh and warm.  Nice decor, good drink selection.   Will be coming back.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Very bad service. When you are paying 18$ for lunch you expect that atleast food is available but when we arrived at 1 45 pm there was nothing available. We were very disappointed. Think twice before going. There are a lot of better options available."}
{"text":"I have never left a review less than  so why did this establishment receive my fist subpar review ?  The food was on par with other establishments in the Metro Phx area.   Actually, I have no complaints about the cuisine.  The service on the other hand was abysmal at best.  The restaurant is advertised to open it's lunch buffet at 11:00 am.  The buffet by 11:27 am was yet to be fully stocked.  After my initial glass of water it remained empty for the duration of my 70 minute stay.  The expediency to remove dirty serving dishes moved at glacier like speeds. While we sat with 5 dirty plates and an empty glass of the hostess sat and stared at her SmartPhone and the young man stocking the buffet ate his lunch behind the bar.     After all was said and done, two adult buffets & mango lassi ran $33.00 which is a little on the high end even for this area.     If the service was exemplary I would have no problem but to watch the staff loiter around while our drink glasses remained empty and dirty dishes continued to stack higher was disappointing to say the least"}
{"text":"We always go there once a week after work as a group for Dinner. Good ambiance and friendly customer service. Reasonably priced with a long list of menu items. The Chef adapts and tries his best to cater to your needs. The ingredients are fresh and the food tastes really good. We have been to many Indian restaurants and Mint is one of our favorites.  Try their ginger Rasam and Spinach paneer with Tandoor Roti. Its awesome !!."}
{"text":"If you're feeling a yearning for some delicious Indian food, look no further! The menu is predominantly South Indian but the North Indian treats such as Chicken Tikka Masala, Paneer Butter Masala and Kadahi Paneer are amazing as well. I was tired of the sub par Indian restaurants in the Phoenix area but Mint has definitely given me some hope. In terms of taste, Mint is definitely up there with the more famous and highly rated restaurants in places such as LA and SFO. If they keep doing this consistently I'll definitely revise my rating to 5 stars."}
{"text":"The big problem with the lunch buffet at Mint Indian Cuisine is that over half of the food items are indifferently prepared.  A few were quite good, but that does not make up for tough chicken in the Tikki Masala, overcooked chicken in the curry, tasteless vegetarian dishes, and Naan that was next to inedible.  Another problem is the layout of the buffet area; it is a tight \"U\" shape which allows very few people access at one time.  The result is lines even when the restaurant is relatively empty.  On the positive side, the seating is comfortable, the service efficient, and you will probably be able to find something you like.  That something won't be the price, however.  Not good enough for a return visit."}
{"text":"The buffet lunch today was excellent.   The variety of dishes..both north and South Indian ..were well prepared .  The desserts and hot tea were an added bonus.  Service was personalized and attentive.  Good experience and would recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Although the coconut chutney has seemed very watery every time I've been & the rasmalai portions seem tinier than any restaurant I've been to, I love the food at this restaurant. Excellent southern Indian dishes. Perfect amount of spices. Great menu. Good service. Love this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this Indian place. My family and I come here many Sunday nights and the food is great, one of the best Indian places in all of AZ. There are many vegetarian options and I always have options of what to order. The restaurant recently underwent new ownership but our favorite waiter Sam Kojak is back. He is an especially good waiter and has so much energy. Under the new management, the plates, silverware, and napkins became better in quality and the food is still great. The atmosphere is nice and I always see Indian families there-a good sign that the food is tasty."}
{"text":"My husband & myself visited the Mint Indian cuisine & liked our dish order. The red wine was delish, my husband ordered long island ice tea (x2 he turned into a real lush). We liked the idea of evening happy hour. The warm welcoming was nice as well as the bartender!! We will definitely return very soon!!! :)"}
{"text":"My 2nd bad experience. The spicy chicken Biryani had jalepenos in them. Authentic Indian?? Mmmm I don't think so :(  It did manage to ruin the taste."}
{"text":"So Indian Paradise closed.  This is the next closest Indian Buffet so decided to give it a try.  I unfortunately didn't take any pictures as I had my hands full with hungry kids.    Walked in and was seated promptly at a table in the middle of the room.  The restaurant is quite larger than expected from the outside.  There happened to be a bit of a line to the buffet.  I went over to view my options and they had plenty of variety.    Now, I have a few select favorites but I tried some new items so I don't know the names...    They start the buffet with a large tub of these UFO shaped disc patties that a soft moist fluffy cakes (I believe made of rice flour?). I grabbed one as everyone seemed to be getting a few.  I stuck with some of my traditional items, basmati rice, butter chicken, fried dough balls with jalapeños, tandoori and a few veggie items.  The fried dough balls were very soggy with grease, almost as if they went into a fryer and the oil wasn't hot enough.    The tandoori was good but wish it had char from a a grill to give it an extra kick of flavor.  The rice was bland, I know it's steamed basmati rice, but other buffets usually doctor it up with some saffron or other spices just to give it a slight boost of flavor.  The butter chicken was really really good, the only downfall was that every piece I chewed on had a joint left in it which made for extra crunchy pull it out of your mouth awkwardness and yah, I know a lot of people like the joints, I just don't prefer them and it turned the kids off to what was a really tasty dish.  Now the naan, here's were I was really disappointed.  I get my food sit down and I'm wondering if they will bring out my naan in a basket like Indian Paradise did and in the past Tast of India, but no, naan is served in a chafing dish in the buffet.  I go to get some and there is only one measly piece left.  I grab it.  Sit back down and take a bite and it's like a cracker.  Snap!  My kids love naan and they roll their chicken and rice into it but they didn't have any available so they just sat and waited.  I asked the server if there was naan coming and she apologized for the wait and assured me they were preparing it and it would be out soon.  At least 10-15 mins go by and still no naan.  The server came by and apologized again.  A few minutes later and a big ol pan of naan arrived to the buffet.  I told my son to go up in line and get some...  well the kind server dumped half the naan in the chafing fish, came over to my table and starts unloading naan onto a plate for us.  Super sweet and even when I told her we had ample naan she threw down to additional pieces.  Again, that was great of her.  The only caveat was we were almost done with our food our tummies settled over the time waiting and though we ate the crap out of that flatbread, the naan was lacking in flavor. It just seemed like a basic dough with no added seasonings like anise or garlic or cilantro, just butter bread.  I'm sure others love it, I just found something flavorless about it.   So I give this place 2.5 stars for our server being really nice and attentive.  But only 2.5 stars because the preparation of the food didn't keep up with the demand (rice and naan empty) and the chicken having joints left in it.  Will I be back?  I'm really not sure."}
{"text":"In my quest to eat a more plant based diet tried this place for the first time and was not disappointed.  The food was excellent, service was great, menu selection was huge, the manager/owner spent quite a few minutes going through menu items to ensure I chose the tastiest vegan items, the restaurant had good ambiance, was clean and food came out fast.  It's in a strip mall and doesn't look like much but looks are deceiving in this case.  Wine selection was limited but the red was good, so they chose wisely.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am sorry that I can't review the food because I went to Mint after hearing they were under new management and could not get waited on.  I arrived and after getting a menu, I did not exist.  They were busy and I was patient.  Three people came in after me.  The 3rd one after I had been waiting 15 minutes. They finally waited on the the 3 people who came in AFTER me and still did not even acknowledge that I was even there.  I will not return and will tell the large Indian population at work about the non-existent service at Mint.  Note to Mint staff:  All you had to do was to say \"I'll be right with you\" or something..Anything.   But to keep walking by a customer and not say anything is not excusable."}
{"text":"Good Ambiance.  We had the paneer butter masala, vegetable korma and egg curry.   Portions were small for price.  Taste was mediocre. I will go elsewhere next time.  Service was ok, it was a slow Thursday night.  Waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Excellent  food and service!! Ask for Sam Kojak for suggestions if you don't know what to order,  he will .   It is family oriented  on one side and romantic on the other.  Love this place! !"}
{"text":"This rating is based on service, which was atrocious. I normally rate more for food than service, but this time I focus more on service. For those who care strictly about food, I would rate the dishes as follows:  Papdi chaat: 5/5 (spicier than normal) Pani puri: 4/5 Hot and sour soup: 5/5 Salty lassi: 5/5 Butter paneer: 5/5 Garlic naan: 5/5 Mushroom mattar: 5/5 Bharwan (malai) kofta: 2/5  Now ... for the circus show we experienced ...  We ordered one vegetarian curry and 30 minutes later (which is too long to bring out a dish), they brought our food. The problem is that it was the wrong order! They remade the order and 20 minutes later, the food came out. They screwed up the order AGAIN and remade the SAME wrong dish. They remade the order one MORE time and this time it came out in 15 minutes. Overall, we waited over an hour for our food. Ridiculous! When I asked the owner if he would consider adjusting the bill, he said \"What for? We gave you what you ordered eventually.\" I LOLed for real. There was clearly no understanding of service, punctuality, quality control, and making things right. They also had to remake our friend's dosa because it arrived cold. We had to flag the wait staff down multiple times for water refills. They rarely stopped by to ask if we needed anything. They didn't bring our check on their own for 20 minutes and we had to flag them down for that, too.  Unfortunately, we couldn't leave a poor tip because the 18% tip was automatically posted since we had a group of 6.  We will be back for the tasty food and hope that this was a one time, super bad service experience. May you have the luxury of time and the patience to wait."}
{"text":"Ken who is the new partial owner is only about money.  I find him insulting and insincere.  It does not seem like he cares about being welcoming or gracious, just get him the money and to heck with your experience.  He must believe \"GREED IS GOOD\"...  The food is also starting to repeat itself on consecutive days and the quality is going way downhill.  By the way, the fact that nobody ready speaks english or cares to get things correct is reason to not support this business.  Former owner was so caring and the food used to be quite nice.  I'll pass now.  PS.  Ken, us customers know when you take cheap shortcuts."}
{"text":"First time trying Indian Cuisine. Mint hit the spot. Staff was helpful and patient explaining the menu and helping us make menu choices. They earned a loyal customer tonight."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch buffet on a Saturday.  Had a lot of variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian items, many I have not seen at other places and everything was very good.  Especially liked the okra dish and the goat byrini.  Try the dahi toast.  It is like a cold sweet/savory bread pudding.  Difficult to describe but addicting. Very fresh."}
{"text":"We have been to Mint a few times for dinner and the food ranges from okay to pretty good. We haven't had anything truly bad but the quality of the food changes between visits. Dosas are usually pretty good and the chicken saag on today's visit was nice. However, the service ranges from terrible to almost okay, hence the three stars. On this particular visit, our server was pretty bad. He might have been new since we have had a different man or woman in the past who have been a bit better. It does always take a long time to pay, which is frustrating. I would come here for takeout, but I do not like dining in here any more."}
{"text":"5 for the food 2 for the service and the super annoying doorbell!     Came early on a Sunday.  Wanted to love it here.  First thing we noticed as we waited for drinks was the horrid doorbell dinging every time someone entered.     Well, on to what is more important.  The happy hour wine were generous glasses and the food was AMAZING.  BUT, the service was SOOOOO slow.  Delightful waiters, but not very efficient.  We felt pretty much ignored.  Had to call the waiter for drinks, for ordering for checking to see if the 'rest' of the dinner was coming. But WOW were they quick to bring the bill.  Funny how that works.   As my husband said, \"I think the buffet is their thing\".  Probably.  And we may try it or more likely will do take out.     Our dinner was almost TWO HOURS due to the slow service.  We just rarely have time to do that.     All that being said, literally the most amazing vegetarian dumpling thingys, most fabulous Masala Tikka and Dosa ever.  Perfect rice.  Just slooooowwwww."}
{"text":"This is a great Indian buffet with better variety than a lot of them. So why only two stars?  Because of an incident where the manager was petty and unaccommodating. I visited when my daughter was sick at home. She had asked if I could bring her back some  plain naan. When I explained this to the manager and asked if there was some way to pay for a couple of naan, he said that they had a hard rule against selling menu items during buffet hours. I get it, but, given the situation, it was a bad call. Take care of your customers, especially sick little girls. This review would have been a 5."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Had the chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, samosas, and rava dosa. All of the dishes were great and came out hot. Service was terrible. Had to go out of our way to get our server's attention multiple times. Great food but service definitely worsened an otherwise good experience."}
{"text":"Beware customers! Even if you place an empty plate in front of your 2 year old, they will charge you separately for kids buffet!  Good way of minting money Mint!! So if you have to feed your toddler, even if it is two bites of dosa, feed from your plate DONOT keep the plate in front of your toddler!! Otherwise they will charge you for that also..!  Awful service!! Unpleasant faces! Asked for a fresh dosa for my 2 year old (as the ones which were already prepared were hard like pappad!) and they took almost 20 mins to get it and they were also pathetic! Never coming back to this place"}
{"text":"Expensive!  Well, compared to this place before it was sold and renamed.  Pricey, yet you have to use plastic cups and ramekins on the buffet for sambar, rasam, chutney, etc.  Plastic cup for desserts.  And paper napkins.  Wonder why they didn't go with plastic utensils too?    Buffet now has more meat choices, if my memory is correct.  Vegetarians who liked the old place may not be fond of this.  There isn't the same or similar range of Southern Indian dosas and utthapam either.  Some atypical items on the buffet, and you can get yellow or red curry entrees on the dinner menu.  Aiming for an Asian fusion theme? Not sure.  Not a good value here, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Food is better than ever...they even added the hard to find Indo-chinese dishes. The service has been spectacular even with Sam gone for over 8 months."}
{"text":"This place is not the place to go if you are in a hurry. BUT if you want seriously good quality, fresly prepared, delicious food then this is your place.  Tonight we had the chili garlic nan bread, the vegetarian fried rice, the chicken vindaloo and the Chicken Milagu kari - all I can say is it was outstanding!  I have eaten in many Indian Resturants, in many countries but these people consistently produce excellent food that surprises me every time I go there. One of my all time favourites."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!  I went thinking I'll have a small bowl of lentil soup, but lucky for me it was a buffet of many things I've never tried!  I had a piece/ tablespoonful of everything. After 3 plates, I still hadn't tried everything, but I was full.  It was to die for! So fresh and so many flavors! The desserts were dreamy, especially the one that resembled a little boiler potato!"}
