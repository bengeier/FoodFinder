{"text":"Do let me first begin this review by mentioning that we did not actually dine in the restaurant but had take-out delivered.

I have given this restaurant just two stars because I am judging them by restaurant food standards and not just buy food standards alone, if someone were to have made this meal for me at home I would've thought it was very good and very well crafted, now by restaurant standards it was mundane at best.

We ordered the fried platter which had Coconut shrimp, sweet potato fries, one single crab cake and fried calamari, perhaps this may taste different or fresher in restaurant but I don't think it should make a difference since it's only 40 minutes from the time that you order it.

I had coconut shrimp before and this was not very good at all, it was way too much coconut on it, it overpowered the shrimp which was overcooked and very tough.

The calamari was very hard and rubbery and the fried batter around it was not very good at all, it was not fresh neither was the shrimp coconut.

The only good thing on the platter was the crab cake and unfortunately you just got one of those.

The french fries that came with the meals and the platter were wet, limp and a bit soggy, they're not very good at all, probably one of the worst french fries I've ever had and I had frozen no name brand french fries.

For the meal portion we had ordered the grilled eggplant and zucchini wrap with Greek cheese and the chicken with avocado sandwich.

The wrap was average at best, I mean it wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't outstanding and I would've expected better out of a restaurant making something so simple as a wrap to make it taste exceptional, it was mundane.

The chicken avocado sandwich was also very pedestrian, it wasn't terrible but at the same time wasn't exceptional, if you're going to be ordering a sandwich from a restaurant you expect something that's going to wow you or have something to offer that you couldn't possibly do when you are at home. As a side note it really wasn't a sandwich it was more of a burger, buns were hamburger buns the size was a burger but it was passed off as a sandwich, that's really neither here or there just a note it was a sandwich that it said.

The meals also came with a salad which was obviously the bag of mixed garden salad that was thrown haphazardly into a Styrofoam box with a few sliced tomatoes and cucumbers, again as a side dish salad you don't expect much but this is really minimal effort. I read the other reviews and the majority of them seem to be along the same lines of reasoning where the food really wasn't all that great, they have a massive menu that has a lot of different cultures and cuisines, I figured they should stick to one thing and do that one thing well rather than doing many things average or poorly. They have pad Thai for God sake! Do they realize that there are at least half a dozen pad Thai restaurants within a seven block radius, what's more there's a pad Thai restaurant across the street that is legendary with the Beecher's!

Overall I must say the food was average to poor. I can tell that if you have a bland pallet and you're not looking for anything particularly exciting, spicy, interesting or new this to be a great place to go check out much akin to going to a friends place and having them quickly whip up something from the kitchen. It is nothing special at all I have to say unless you are that bland or boring, I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I have only dined here once, but was not impressed.  There was a strange chemical smell (heavy cleaning products?) that permeated the place and put me off my food, which was kind of mediocre to begin with.  It's got a nice patio in the back if you just want drinks.  The menu variety wasn't bad, but the service was a little slow. - even though it wasn't very busy.  There are better places to eat nearby."}
{"text":"We've been here for brunch a few times.  Portions are generous and prices are fair.  Food is ok.  Service is ok.  Very nice patio in the back."}
{"text":"The lunch here was one of the worst in recent memory.  I wish i could say something positive, but i can't.  The food was bland and unexciting and the service was poor.  Avoid."}
{"text":"So I have mixed feelings when it comes to the beach bird. 
We went last night (Thursday evening - made a reservation because Thursday is the new Friday) and when we got there it was practically empty - which I didn't necessarily mind. 
We chose a table and the waiter/host gave us menus. We were asked about drinks but we hummed and hawed over the drink menu so that took about an extra 5 minutes. After he came back to get our drink order we had pretty much decided about dinner so we placed that order too. 
Time goes by....a lot of it....like 30-40 minutes...tick.tock. 
Finally my boyfriend and my mother get their \"appetizers\", let me say this I am no Indian food connoisseur, in fact it's probably on the low end of cuisine I'd like to eat, but I can certainly tell you that appetizer was NOT indian paan bread....it was a crustini with garlic butter, 2 pieces of sliced tomato and a sliver or pathetic cheese. Me and my mom looked at each other like UMM???? 
The night goes on....another 15-20 minutes later dinner is (FINALLY) served. I had the blue crab pasta, my mom and boyfriend has the amaretto butter chicken on basmati and my sister had the four cheese pizza. Thankfully all our mains were fab, my pasta was nice and spicy, my boyfriend cleared his plate insisting he must eat it all, and my sister's four cheese pizza (minus the tomato sauce N.B.) was delicious. 
We decided to push our luck and order dessert (my mom and boyfriend got dessert as it came with their prefix menu), I order the banana foster bread pudding, my sister ordered the marshmellow brownie and the prefix dessert was some sort of indian dessert having to do with milk and balls of some sort soaked in rose something. The bread pudding was TO DIE FOR, it was like heaven on my damn tongue!!!!! GO ORDER IT NOW! 
So overall while the service was SLOOOWWWWWW the food was good (minus the weird app), and in all fairness there appeared to be ONE cook and ONE server/host. Note to the owners, while the server we had was a great guy, give him some help!!"}
{"text":"Mixed bag at the Beach Bird - Breakfast = tremendous, Lunch = good, Dinner = meh. 

Breakfast
Admittedly breakfast is hard to screw up, but still they excelled. Great veggie fritatta, fruit crepes and standby eggs, bacon & toast plate. Coffee was good and always refilled on queue. 

Lunch
Had a decent sandwich & fries, can't complain

Dinner
Two words. Weird menu. You can get Pad Thai, Tex-mex, Souvlaki, Escargot, and Tuscan salad all on the same menu. And nothing seems to be done well... Just mediocre. IMHO pick something and do it well. Don't do 7 types of cuisine poorly. 

Back patio is cool and drinks were good. Just an odd mix of stuff all jumbled in. Weird."}
{"text":"Popped in here last night for a late dinner. It's close to my apartment and i'm still discovering all that my new neighbourhood has to offer.
Right off the bat they impressed us. We waltzed in at 9:30 and they were obviously hoping to be winding down to for night. there was only a couple of other guests seated, who looked like they were wrapping up. But the staff double check that the kitchen was good to go and seated us.
I ordered a Singapore Sling, which was not the best... The appetizer of cheesy cajun garlic bread came to the table and made up for it. Yummm.
I ordered the grilled chicken with cesar salad and sweet potato fries. The chicken was really good with a tomato sauciness. The salad was very plain. No croutons, no bacon bits, no shaved parm. Dissapointing. But the sweet potato fries were great!
I really wanted to try the creme brulee, but alas, my stomach was full to the brim! Another time... I'll come back to try some more dishes."}
{"text":"Wow, I almost feel bad commenting after two 5 star reviews, but this place isn't great.  This is not a 5 star restaurant, and it's not just me, the others we were with agreed.  I'll recount my experience and you can judge for yourself.  If you don't want the details, here is the summary - Their menu is too large for them to do anything well.  Lots of variety but everything is just mediocre.  You see this in Restaurant Makeover all the time and I never really got it until I came here.  There are some gems in the menu, but overall not impressive.

The Scenario:
-------------
Ok, we were there with 35 some odd people.  Basically we had the entire back covered patio area.  They had to pull in patio furniture and all that, but I appreciate they did what they needed to do to accommodate us.  With such a large group, and the front of house being busy they still managed to drop off all of the food to the tables at around the same time so we could all eat together.  Very commendable.  

Drinks:
-------
So we start with some drinks as people are arriving.  I have a beer.  Cheers to them for serving local beer on tap.  Had a nice Mill Street Tankhouse Ale to get things started which was great.  The ladies however were not so lucky.  They start with the lemonade.  It's served with a flavour shot of sorts (raspberry, blueberry).  Well to start, the lemonade was powdered lemonade.  We could tell because of the taste, and because there was a bunch of the powder still at the bottom of the glass.  It was all around bad..  The other mixed drinks were terrible as well...I'll save you the pain of going through all the ones we had, but my advice is - stick with beer, or wine or something that doesn't require them to mix it up.

Appetizers
-----------
We had a few between the 5 of us:
1) Spinach Dip - Looked great, but seriously had no flavour.  Very disappointing as this is a fan fav.
2) Bacon Wrapped Shrimp - Shrimp were cooked perfectly and were a decent size.  The Bacon was rubbery and undercooked (put on after the shrimp were cooked I believe).  The sauce was very bland and didn't add anything to do the dish. Should have passed on this one but the description was good.  Strike 2 on the food. 
3) Bruschetta - Actually really really good.  Great flavour, good size.  We had it with cheese, and strangely the cheese was on the bottom, with the bruschetta topping piled on top.  My Fav appetizer here.

To the first two commenters...I did hear from others at the table that the quesadilla's were good, and so were the calamari...but didn't have them myself.

The Mains
----------------
I asked the waitress if I should have the pizza or the lasagna.  \"Ohhh, definitely pizza\" she says, sort of in a shocked tone.  So I have the Calabrese pizza with tomato sauce, buffalo mozzarella, Italian sausage, red peppers and black olives.  Sauce was from a can, crust was from a package, not baked fresh by any means, and the toppings were good but a bit sparse.  Again, good concept, but not enough focus to make it good or great.  I was disappointed.

My wife and a few others had the Creole pasta.  Just so-so. Mostly a tomato base with some \"Creole seasoning\".  Not bad, not great.  One other had the Callypso (yes spelt with two L's) Pasta, which was really good.

Dessert
--------------
We didn't have any.  Were heading out to the next venue for drinks so we took a pass.

Checking out
-----------------
The bills were a pain but again, to be expected with such a large group.  they did individual bills for everyone, and let us put the tip on which I respected (instead of charging a standard 15%)...yes I left a good tip, the waitress was good given how busy they were.  With that said knowing a group of 35 was coming in, they could have staffed up a bit.

Overall Summary
----------------------
I wouldn't go back to the Beach Bird Restaurant.  The servers were good, they handled the large group well, but the food was just on the mediocre/poor side.  Prices were ok, but a bit pricy for what you got. There are so many better restaurants in the Beaches area to choose from (The Green Eggplant across the street is apparently amazing), I wouldn't waste my time coming here unless it was for the bruschetta and the calypso chicken."}
{"text":"We stopped in last night for dinner. We did have a 2 for 1 coupon.
The 2 dishes we ordered were quite good although it seemed pointless to order the steak salad medium rare as it came well done. I asked for a steak knife and when it was delivered halfway through my meal, the server-Kat saw that he meat was not medium rare. She did offer to replace it, but it would have been another long wait.
I asked for the bill and this was quite an experience! Kat kept walking by and looking at me. After 20 minutes I once again requested the bill.she insisted that she already brought it. Upon further investigation she found it in the kitchen, noting at least it was warm! I said it was probably cold as it has sat so long, This resulted in a very nasty look , and no apology from Kat. All round poor service with attitude."}
{"text":"Very horribly slow service. So absolutely bad that we actually walked out.

We arrived here around 5:30pm and the back patio was only half full. We noticed a lot of agitated people trying to pay, always a bad sign. We waited a full 10-15 minutes just to be brought menus. We ordered water and a beer straight away. 15-20 minutes later and our drinks still hadn't arrived. 

My friend was so hungry that we realized waiting to order and receive food would take the entire evening, so we got up and left. Our server and drinks were still nowhere to be seen as we exited through the front doors.

Judging by the other reviews, this miserable service is quite common at this place. If you're impatient like me or do not have 4 hours to spare to eat a meal, give this place a pass."}
{"text":"This was a great dinner affair! The menu is extensive and well versed. We enjoyed the calamari and seafood fondue as appy's and they were very very yummy.
We noticed upon looking over the menu that there are a fair few fish items from the Atlantic area opposed to most TO restaurants providing fish and seafood from the Pacific. Atlantic is particularly yummy! Not quite as oily.
We each enjoyed a pasta dish and they were each cooked to perfection!
i highly recommend if you ever visit The Beaches area or live near by!
yum!"}
{"text":"GREAT service and menu. Our soups, veggie wrap and veggie quesadilla were beyond improvement. Love this place. Will return next time we visit Toronto. (+ 2 blocks from the beach)"}
