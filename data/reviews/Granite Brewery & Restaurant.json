{"text":"I will admit I've only been here once, recently though. The food is definitely \"Meh\" and overall menu looks pretty uninspired to be honest. They have a handful of respectable brews and are mostly known for their cask-conditional ales that are of a less carbonated, room temperature ilk. As Dry Stouts go, their Keefe's Irish Stout is good and the Hopping Mad Cask IPA has a tasty kick that doesn't kill your taste buds like some (still awesome) American IPA's can. Service was painfully slow in the bar area and I'm pretty sure the bartender was either just disinterested in his job or not programmed with a sense of urgency. Either way, if I'm in that area again and craving a beer, I'd go back and sit on the patio...Summer is just around the corner!"}
{"text":"I went here for drinks after dinner with my best gal. The beer was tasty although for some reason all 3 types I tired had a bizarre head. Not dense and foamy but more like you'd get if you didn't rinse a glass and there was still soap in it. The place was interesting and they had books and games that you could play, however the ambiance, in the bar area at least was a little empty and felt \"cafeteria-y\". The clientèle on this night was pretty \"hobo-y\". All and all the staff was friendly, the price was right but I'm not sure if I'd make a special trip."}
{"text":"Anyone who says the food isn't great here hasn't tried the curries.   I am addicted to the Granite's butter chicken, and my fiance loves the lamb curry. We eat a lot of Indian food, and these curries are some of the best in the city.   Some of the kitchen staff have been working there since day 1 (23 years ago), so they've had time to perfect these things. There are special menu items every week, so if you don't want curry but you're looking for something different than the usual pub grub, give those a try. Though the wings are pretty tasty too.   Hey beer drinkers! If you're only interested in over-the-top in-your-face boozy craft beer, you can take your business elsewhere, and everyone will be the better for it. The Granite is an English style open-top fermenting brewery. Their beers are going to taste different, they will be more subtle than what you expect from a craft brewery, but they all have their merits. My favourite is the Darkside black IPA, though at 4% the Summer goes down easy on a hot day."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here.  We just discovered that they have a huge place on the back which is not visible from the front. There's also a patio which seems to be really nice in the summer.  We started with the beer. Their good variety of house-made beer should satisfy anyone's expectations.  We started off with the soup of the day \"Tomato and Parmesan\" which was way better than we expected. As our main dish, I had the \"Shrimp and Chicken Linguine\" and hubby had the \"Chipotle Lamb Burger\". The portion of both foods was pretty generous and we both loved them for their taste as well.  The service was quick and to the point. We were well taken care of despite the fact that it was a rather busy day for them. We'll be regulars here for sure!"}
{"text":"Still trying to find a damn good brewhouse in TO.  I'd brew my own if I could find a half decent home brew market.  Look... this place sucks if you are looking for good beer.  Their IPA was closer to a coors then a Dog Fish Head (if you get that, you know what I mean).  Skip it.  Go to Mill St."}

{"text":"This is one of my standard places to go to when I feel like relaxing with a pint of GOOD beer.  I see how this place might not be everybody's cup of tea (or should I say pint of ale?)  -- especially if you don't care about beer that much) -- but if you do like beer, I urge you to give it a try.  I've been coming to this place for over 7 years now, and beer is certainly the main reason I come here.  LOCATION I find the area around the pub somewhat depressing.  It's right on the corner of two major roads, there are old unsightly apartment buildlings all over the area.  I live near Eglinton a bit west of Yonge, and I think I'd go here more often if the walk to this place was more enjoyable.  As it is, Granite and Twisted Kilt (another place with notable taps in the area) are about equidistant from me, and I choose to go to TK more often partly because it's a nicer walk and it's located on a fairly upbeat stretch of Yonge.  But then, I know I am unusually sensitive to this sort of thing (I have no idea how people voluntarily choose to live in suburbia for example and go to huge ugly malls for entertainment, ugh!)  DECOR & ATMOSPHERE It's not a very fancy place.  I best like the little section near the entrance, the one with all the books.  The back room feels too large, too isolated, gloomy and devoid of personality (they might have a fireplace back there, but that does not salvage it).  The front patio is tiny and lacks any kind of appeal - you will have to stare at the worst of midtown's \"architecture\" and scream to be heard over the Mount Pleasant traffic.  The back patio is much cozier - and sheltered from the rain too (even if it is a vinyl sheet they stretch over it).  They have a new big TV near the front and a few smaller ones, but the sound is never on - that's the pub's policy, apparently.  There are the books I mentioned and some trivia cards on some of the tables.  There might be board games - but I never asked.  SERVICE A couple of times over the years I've encountered rude service here, but that was over 3 years ago.  Once it was a rude guy who seemed impatient with us the whole time, and at the end openly scoffed at his tip (and it was a generous tip, especially considering the service, but we dared to include some pennies among the coins, which he told were going straight into the garbage, 'cause he has no room in his pockets to carry such worthless stuff).  Another time we showed up about an hour before closing time, and were greeted by the same guy who told us the pub was closing now, since it was a slow night.  Those two experienced (spaced fairly closely together, as in within a couple of months of each other) almost put me off this place for good, but I haven't seen that guy there for a while, so he might not work there anymore.  Other than that, the service has been quite good.  The waiters are all friendly and some are real sweethearts.  Food and drink generally arrive pretty quickly.  BEER Ah, this is where this place shines.  They brew their own stuff, and it's darn good stuff!!!  My personal favourites are Best Bitter, Best Bitter Special (dry-hoppe and cask-conditioned), and Peculiar.  Gin Lane (\"barley wine\", 9%) is also an interesting alternative.  When locally root beer is available, it's an interesting alcohol-free alternative.  (I find that most places have extremely underwhelming non-alcoholic drink selection, so I get all excited when I come upon a place that offers some interesting beverages in addition to the usual boring overpriced line-up of ultra-sugary pops and not-very-good-juices).  There is also a beer store, where Granite beers can be bought to go in growlers.  FOOD The food is not this place's forte.  Occasionally they manage a surprisingly decent special, but for the most part the food is not well executed.  The fries might be fresh and real, but the side veggies are definitely out of some sort of frozen package.  Salad dressings taste like overprocessed storebought crap.  Still, food is edible enough, though, that I come here anyway: I order food just to fill the tummy and then concentrate on enjoying the taste of the beer.  BONUS Free wi-fi!  This could be a not-bad place to get work done over a couple of pints, if beer gets your creative juices flowing better than coffee does."}
{"text":"Stick to pub food because this place reached too high for summerlicious. Salad was tiny and wilted and beef ravioli in rose sauce with lobster was oddly bland. Desert was tiny and uninspired. Beer was good but pricey."}
{"text":"Might just be the best pub in the area. They brew a number of their own delicious beers, the food is high end pub fare (honestly it's great), the staff are friendly, and the overall environment is top notch.  I'll be back many times."}
{"text":"My husband and I got married at the Granite and we wouldn't have had it any other way. The back terrace was the perfect place to host our small ceremony and the back room was perfect for the reception.  We had approximately 80 guests and to be honest I wouldn't go too much over that for a sit-down  meal as the seating was a little cramped, but it didn't really dampen anyone's spirits. The whole back room and courtyard were ours and while there is no bar in the back, there was never a prolonged delay in getting a drink. We had a dedicated service staff and they were very attentive to my husband and I as well as our guests.  Ron was very professional and was great to work with, he and his staff have done a lot of weddings and have things down to a fine art.  We had to account for a number of dietary needs among our guests; vegetarians, vegans and one with celiac disease (no gluten). Ron and his team were able to modify our buffet menu in order to accommodate all the different dietary needs and with little impact on the cost per person. The best part, everyone loved the food! Thank you Ron and the rest of the Granite Family for making our special day so memorable."}
{"text":"The beer is good, but not nearly one of my favourite microbrews in Toronto.   I had the ribs and wings. The ribs were just terrible. I have never had such dry ribs in my life, I wanted to send them back but I was just too hungry and had plans shortly after.  The wings were good, nothing special.  The server was awesome. I wish I could remember his name. He was an older guy in his 40's who wore glasses."}
{"text":"Rawwrrrrr growls the jugs on the left side of this cask ale heaven.  Yes the food is averagely good, but that's not why you're here.  I'm going to drop a tip while its hot right now... You can buy the beers to go up until 11pm!  I suggest the summer ale.   You'll never be buying from the lcbo again!"}
{"text":"Eaten Sunday Brunch, A Saturday Afternoon lunch and a week night dinner at this pub since we moved in across the street 6 months ago.  The place is always somewhat busy and the servers are attentive and the food is decent and well priced.  It is a very casual local place that we go to when we just don't feel like cooking.  Suits our needs and the menu is big enough to appeal to all!"}
{"text":"This is a great place.   Fantastic original beers are brewed on site.  The food is good and so is the atmosphere.   I come here often."}
{"text":"I, too, am surprised at the subpar reviews this place has gotten - especially considering how C'est What? seems to have performed better on Yelp.  I went to both when I was in Toronto and found Granite Brewery far superior.  I am a beer snob of moderate proportions, but it's definitely overwhelmed by my inherent, unquenchable love for beer.  That is, I prefer the good stuff and I go out of my way to find it, but if you handed me a PBR I'd probably be happy with it.  When I went with my friend, we started out by ordering the sampler platter of beers and I thought that most of them were quite good.  One - I think it was the high-hops content variety - tasted a little bit like it was drawn from the dregs of the keg, but the other kinds were full-bodied and rich.  I've had better beer before, certainly, but beer made by monks who do nothing other than live in Belgium, chant, and make brew is going to be better than beer made by an establishment that needs to make money by doing other things.  That said, I found the Old Peculiar here to be delicious.  I considered taking a growler of it home, but didn't want to deal with customs.  Maybe I just went here on an \"on\" day for this place, but the service was fast and friendly, and I thought the food was quite good.  I ordered a grilled fish sandwich with guacamole which was fabulous, and my friend got the mac and cheese.  She found her dish a little too spicy - it had jalepenos in it - but said the flavor was good.  So... I have to say I don't know why this place hasn't performed better in ratings, but I guess I happened to hit it on a good day.  Or maybe I just drank enough beer that the entire world was glorious, regardless.  Minus one star for the somewhat odd location and the fact that the one beer tasted like it had been dredged from the bottom of the barrel.  Four overall."}
{"text":"I just held a party for 27 people (including kids) at this place. Booked a reservation a week ahead on the patio and everything worked out perfectly. Nice outside patio in back perfect for summer and winter eating. Also have free parking available underneath the Brewery. The food was fantastic. I had the Jerk chicken pasta. Nice!. Service was great. Everyone at the party seemed to have a great time. Recommended."}
{"text":"I so pale....  This place was horrible....  we went there exclusively to get the Dark side IPA and guess what? they didn't have it !!! Oh nooooo !!!  but let me tell you the whole story...  We went in and the whole ambiance was weird.... we were forced to sit backwards (that is facing away from the table) just to be made a mockery of for doing so.  There was an entomologist convention going on, or something similar because most of the people was focused on the fruit flies because they were e-v-e-r-y-w-h-e-r-e... so annoying! Later on, it became a big big hassle as a melee of blind people was stumbling and bumping into the tables and walls while trying to run away from them, until we got it under control, we made an example of one of them... then the rest just fled temporarily.  When our food arrived to the table we were harassed by a grumpy lady that was yelling at us repeating that we were not supposed to be table 117 !!! (go figure), then she continued with her outburst by pointing fingers at other waiters and general public...  The food was not good. We ordered the burger Nochos, the meatloaf Nochos and the chicken club Nochos. The burger was too peppery, and the meatloaf was \"all right\" and the chicken club nothing to write home about.  As far as the beers, the summer ale Nochos was OK, just OK and The Hopping Mad Nochos was about 2 and a half stars.  Bottom line, the place is run-down and dirty. I'm praying we don't get tummy trouble.  After thoughtful consideration we have decided to ban it. Yeah, you heard me, its forbidden !!!"}
{"text":"Came to this place with my husband for summerliciouse menu. What a disappointment. Food was below any bar average. I don't understand how come this place has such good reviews. I had fish with rice. The rice was just plain dry rice from a rice cooker without any sauce or seasoning or oil. Never had such horrible rice anywhere.  Interior is outdated and feels very old. I have to admit that beer was very good, even though I don't drink normally."}
{"text":"Hit or miss with this place. I've thoroughly enjoyed taste testing with the tester paddle, the seasonal specials were fun. As for food, the drunken mac and cheese is amazing. I went back because of this, but I ordered a chicken burger and it was just OK. Service also a hit or miss - the inconsistency is a bit frustrating."}
{"text":"Consistently good service. One waitress, over many, many years, wasn't interested or accommodating. All others, every time, are great. Full of smiles. These people know their food, and the craft beer is second to none. Been going to this place for over a decade, and don't see that stopping anytime soon. Lots of different places to sit, and two patios: the back one is amazing. Always busy ... no wondering why! Only a handful of beers, but each is a taste treat and brewed right there in house. Tremendous, from a beer perspective."}
{"text":"Slow service.  Average, at best, food.  Unremarkable beer (Peculiar is okay, otherwise, urgh).   It is beside a really good cheese store though, so that's something. Maybe just stop by the retail store for a growler of Peculiar, and then go pick up some fancy cheese next door and then just go home. It'll taste better, and be cheaper too."}
{"text":"So hit or miss it's not even funny. Don't even attempt going here on a \"special occasion\" night---when Winterlicious or birthday parties are happening. The hostess was a MESS...literally as if she had no social skills or received an ounce of training. We got there an were told \"there is no room.\" No offer of how many minutes it would be or offer to put our names down (um, isn't that your JOB?!?) Complete incompetence. People were seated out of order in front of us, but when we got to the back room there were at least 6 open tables. They need to do something about acoustics to manage the noise level---you can't have a conversation. Food was \"meh\"....overpriced, bland ribs and greasy quesadillas with cold chopped tomatoes inside. Our food came out of order, too. Overall, I had been looking forward to a nice family dinner out and left irritated and stressed. We are not returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Took my Dad here for Father's Day.  The atmosphere was quite pleasant on the back patio.  We chose a table in the shade, though there were plenty of tabled in the sun as well. The waiter was quick to take our drink order, and my Summer Ale came to quench my thirst.  Sipping on the beer, I expected more from the brewery.  The beer was unexceptional.  The food was OK.  I had a steak salad, my Dad ordered a three cheese, mushroom omelette.  The portion size was fine, the flavours OK.   Would I return, yes because the patio was nice.  Hopefully the other beers are better."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch during the Christmas holidays with family. Selection of food is good also for vegetarians. Had the blackened salmon salad. Very good. Others had fish and chips, burgers and fries and a rack of ribs which was apparently a little dry.   The service was good.  The waitress nice and efficient.  Prices are a bit high, but I've seen worse.  Would go back for sure. ."}
{"text":"The beers are fab!   Great outdoor area in the back in the heat of summer, nice atmosphere.  The food is hit and miss -  fish and chips are a hit, apps are mostly breading on their crab cakes and calamari, asian dishes are a miss - why even offer these? Just stick to what you know, great basic pub food."}
{"text":"Haven't had the booze here yet, but the food is pretty decent.  Nothing to write home about, but if you're looking for a cheap bite of food, it's a very good option.  (Okay, my only big complaint is the use of mannequins in the decor of the place.  SO SO SO CREEPY, holy crap.)"}
{"text":"Quaint restaurant, with decent food and beer. They also offer free parking although if planning to drink then that won't be of much help.  Tried their beer, my favourite is the raspberry beer.  Also tried the passion fruit beer, which smells amazing but still prefer the taste of the raspberry. Also tried their regular lager, also a favourite of my husband.  Hamburgers and wings were great and staff are very friendly. Great spot midtown!"}
{"text":"I actually don't mind it here but a) the beer is supposed to be the main attraction and b) the beer isn't that good.  I mean, it's way better than macrobrew junk at bad pubs, but it really isn't notable craft beer.  It probably would have been something special in 2002, but the craft beer explosion means that you can find better beer in other places where beer isn't even the focus.  I definitely wouldn't recommend this place to someone who regularly drinks quality craft beer."}
{"text":"Great local spot to grab craft brews and cask beer. The food was on point and the waiter was warm and welcoming, he knew everything on the beer and food menu. We didn't wait long for anything and the food was very good, the atmosphere made me feel like I was at my grandparents house but a bit darker, there were bookshelves along the wall and a lot of other great decor.   Don't skip out here, go and enjoy an Best Bitter Special!"}
{"text":"If you don't know the beer, you'd better know the food ...our experience tonight is that training is needed here, server knew neither. Missed opportunity.  The food is fine, the beers are fine, but nothing wows. Ambiance is nonexistent."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, each time the food has been fresh and tasty. It's more family restaurant style food then pub fair but a great selection. had the lamb burger and salad and it was the perfect portion size. The beer is okay.. nothing special in my opinion but since it's so close and I like the patio I'm sure I'll be returning."}
{"text":"The Granite Brewery surprised me. I have walked by this place a hundred times before and my impression from the outside has always been that it's just an old dive desperately in need of a makeover that never gets much business. The reality is slightly different.   First of all this place is a microbrewery serving 8 to 10 of their own ales, brewed in house. The beers were quite good and a nice change from the typical brews they seem to serve in every pub in this city. They also sell these by the case or keg to take away.   The décor, as assumed, is dated. It kind of feels like you're sitting in your grandparents livingroom if they still had the same décor they had when they were first married.  Despite appearances this place is BIG. They have two small front rooms and a big dining room in the back with a fireplace.  The clientele was mostly old. Like retired white hair old for the most part.   The menu is extensive, everything from brunch, to dinner to late night pub food. The nachos were absolutely loaded with toppings to the point that I don't think we found a single plain chip in the mix. Perfect. I've heard the rest of the menu is pretty tasty too.   Oh and I almost forgot about the service. It's extremely friendly and accommodating and they have their own free parking lot below the brewery.   I went here with low expectations and came out fairly impressed. I'll be back in the summer to chill on their patio.  ***Tip: Their beer store is open until 11pm Monday to Saturday. This information is key if you run out of beer after the beer store is already closed***"}
{"text":"As an out of town - heck, out of COUNTRY - business traveler, I love to take in some local establishments and leave the chain places for other times. Had seen their ad in the Best Western guide - and thought I'd give it a try. The food was incredible - LOVED my  Hawaiian Chicken sandwich - great combination of flavors. And the service was awesome!! Given the opportunity, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Because I live in the area, there is always a growler from Granite in my refrigerator. I really like their seasonal beers. There is also a buffet style brunch on Sunday. It's nothing amazing but pretty deals for what you're paying."}
{"text":"English-style ales and consistently good food ... how can you go wrong? The Granite provides a great offering of their own brews (try a flight)!, plus a menu with a whole variety of choices (personally, I love the Greek Salad with a piece of salmon added on top.)   Friendly service, CLEAN WASHROOMS (this is important, people) and tasty craft brews ... love this place."}
{"text":"Average beer. Average food. Average service. Slightly below average decor. I was really hoping for more in terms of beer styles and food quality. Seems like there is a local following and a nice patio out back but still a very average experience overall."}
{"text":"1) Place-5 2) Food-3 3) Service-3 4) Light-3 5) Price-4 Total PFSLP=18 Good place for beer with friends. #pfslp"}
{"text":"Highly palatable upscale pub fair with fine beer brewed in house. Great for a Thursday burger and pint to start off or great for Sunday brunch after a three day bender."}
{"text":"Went to Granite brewery for Winterlicious ($28/person) a little while back, this was my 2nd visit to the pub. The first visit was a number of years ago, coming across the pub by accident and going in to grab a bite to eat -- I fondly remember the food being quite decent so my family and I came back for Winterlicious this year to try their food out. The restaurant is located right on the corner of Mt.Pleasant and Eglinton.   For the location, they have parking, which if you are anywhere along Eglinton area can be a pain at times so that is an A+. When you first enter the restaurant, it looks tiny, a bar area, seating to your right and left, but as they lead you to the back, there's a huge dining area! Comfortably seated at pub tables here and there.   We ordered their soup - which was sweet potato and sour cream that night; two orders of jalapeno poppers; one order of mushroom and goat cheese salad and a calamari appetizer to share. All the food was good - I would say typical of pub style food, nothing fancy but filling and to some extent satisfying. The calamari app was quite large and crispy. For entree, we ordered three prime rib with sweet potato mash and vegetables and one lamb shank with mashed potatoes and vegetables. I will say this about their meals, THEY ARE HUGE. They are of massive proportions so go hungry. We ended up having to pack essentially more than one whole meal. The prime rib was cooked more medium as it was smoked but was also soft and quite tender for medium. I would say that the one downside is that it was a little salty but not unbearably so. My mom's lamb was dry unfortunately, no matter how much sauce she used to cover it up, it seemed slightly overcooked as the meat itself was not tender. She finished about half and just packed the other half home. Desserts were of small proportion - but probably good because we could barely stomach it after the meal. They weren't anything special at all. We also ordered a mini beer flight, not at all expensive and tried four small beers - a great way to get to know their selection before committing to something so you won't hate it!  Overall, if you're looking for a hearty meal that will fill you up and you enjoy pub style food, I would definitely recommend. The waiters and staff there are friendly and try their best. The restaurant is definitely worth coming to try for a night out."}
{"text":"A decent place. Came here to grab some food, and I ended up inhaling some quesadillas, burger, and crab cakes.  The food was good. The service spotty. Basically just another pub.  Did not try the beer so I cannot comment on that selection."}
{"text":"All I can say is that customer service goes a long way!  They are super nice there!  I went there with my parents for Winterlicious last weekend.  I got an appetizer of spring rolls (delicious).  I ordered an entree of \"tofu and vegetable chow mien\".  When I got it, I noticed that there was chicken in it!  I'm a vegetarian and I did check and there was no description of chicken in the menu.  When I brought this up to the server, she apologized immediately (she didn't realize there was chicken in it either) and they got me another one asap and didn't charge me for my meal.  I'm glad I alerted them that there was chicken in it because it was their only vegetarian item for Winterlicious, so they may run into it again.  One of the servers there was vegetarian and he had planned to have it for lunch, so I'm glad I was able to let him know before he got an unexpected surprise!  The vegetarian chow mien was delicious though.  I got tiramisu for dessert and it was very good as well.  It was nice, comfy, lots of room, bright, decent decor.  I don't drink beer, so I don't know anything about the brewery.  It was close to my place and had a vegetarian option which is why I went out with my parents for Winterlicious here.  They both enjoyed their meals as well.  The customer service is what made me really like this place.  I don't eat out  much but I'd probably go back again at some point."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed that people would use the word Grim to describe this place. This place, located at Mount Pleasant and Eglinton is a really superb venue. Walking into this brewery (which makes it's own beers on site) is like walking into an old english pub. The decor is classic old England. the dark wood, the floral curtains, the great photos on the wall all help create real great feel.  If you are a rib fan then you must try their stout marinated ribs.. they are delish!  I tried pretty much all of the beers and they all were incredibly unique. For a truly memorable experience, makes sure to ask for the owner, Ron Keefe. Talking to him about his brews, you can see someone with a true passion for what he does. He will help you pair your beer with your food (rather than wine with your food) and I'm sure if you ask nicely he will even let you see into their open fermentors.   As patio season is fast approaching, you can definitely wet your whistle on their spacious back patio."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to the area a few months ago, and visited Granite Brewery 2 times. We really enjoy their beer, especially Ringberry, excellent thirst quencher for hot summer weekends. We also like their food, we tried chicken, fish and lamb dishes, all were quite delicious. We will definitely visit again and recommend to our friends."}
{"text":"This brewpub is pretty hit or miss. The back patio is great and the food is pretty good, but the beer isn't anything to write home about and the interior is downright dreary. It's kind of like what 80s Toronto thought a pub should look like.  I had the chipotle lamb burger, which was a bit sloppy, but the lamb was very good and the sauce was great. The chickpea soup was a pleasant  surprise -- it had a bit of a kick to it.  I gave this place three stars because the service is very friendly."}
{"text":"Grabbed a spot on the patio at the end of the season. After a great run, we were starving. Ordered a pint and my stomach screamed for a burger. No question, Stout Drunken Burger with fries was what I needed.   The burger was fabulous. The burger patty and fries are both made in house. Both were quite tasty. I was so hungry, I didn't take a photo of it. I don't think I've ever done that before.   Our server had a great sense of humour even though the place was packed! There was an event in the back room, but many of the guests stuck around to have a few drinks. He was so calm; this must happen often. It's a large venue. Decor is a bit dated, but it's an English pub and it looks like one!"}
{"text":"The ambiance in their library room is the only redeeming quality of this place. Staff was inattentive, food unspectacular, and beer particularly substandard. I had high hopes. Should have scaled them back dramatically.   Indie Ale House isn't too far away, and it's better in just about every way imaginable."}
{"text":"We came for dinner as part of the Old Toronto Beer Tour. This was our last stop from an exciting day of drinking and sightseeing. We ate from a fixed menu and we were welcomed by the owner of the establishment.   I can't comment about the regular menu and our service was very attentive being part of this tour. We arrived around 6:30pm and this place was very busy. They were also hosting a wedding reception in the back of the restaurant. I have to agree with the other reviewers that the decor is dated. Washrooms at least are modern and clean.   On our fixed menu, we had Roasted Striploin as our main with Garden salad and Bruschetta as appetizers and Apple Brown Betty for dessert. Each of the courses was paired with a different beer. At this point, I couldn't tell whether the beers were good or not but what I can tell you is that none were as memorable as the beers I had in the other stop of the tour. If I have to pick one, I'll go with Granite's Peculiar for me.   The striploin was excellent along with the mashed potatoes. The sautéed vegetables were okay. The rest of the dishes were okay with the exception of the dessert. I didn't like the dessert. The bruschetta reminds to the one that I make at home.   Not sure if I will come back on my own. Food is not bad, standard pub fare so no surprise there."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a Robbie Burns Supper. This is the second time I've visited the Granite on this occasion and it did not disappoint. I'd say that the regular pub menu is not my fave and I'd give it a 3, but the Burns Supper is a 4.  For $60 taxes and grat included you get the following (and each course is piped in-- not forgetting the traditional addressing of the Haggis):  The most amazing volcano of hot cheesy herb bread. I had no idea that this was Scottish, but who gives a care, it's delish!!  The second course is a traditional Scotch Broth with mutton and pearl barley.  Followed by the beloved Haggis. I say 'beloved' because I think that I am actually in love with haggis. I totally might marry it. The dark ale served with this haggis is the most perfect beer and food pairing I've had to date. The Haggis brings out a lovely raw cocoa note in the beer.  Then is a smoked prime rib with neeps and tatties. The smoking of the prime rib adds lots of flavour and is a nice alternative to the roasted meat we've all had before.  And then the trifle... who doesn't love whipped cream, custard, fruit and cake soaked in booze? I'm not sure that they soaked this particular one in booze, but it was yummy.  I should mention that each course is served with a nice craft beer and the meal os topped off with a wee dram of scotch. I would have preferred this earlier to pour over my haggis as I'm not a fan of scotch, but it's always nice to be generous an play giveaway with your neighbour. Because I love it when someone does this for me.  Overall, a great event for a solid price if you like poetry, haggis and bagpipes. I do."}
{"text":"The Granite Brewery has been a mainstay at this location for several decades. It serves a wide variety of craft beer for almost every palate. I was surprised - and very pleased - this establishment is still located here. A lot has changed in this area and within a few blocks of this intersection.   My father had the full rack rib dinner -- and by far -- it was one of the largest racks he had ever been served. He loves his ribs and this meal did not disappoint his taste buds. I had the large Greek Salad with the Appetizer of the week called bruschetta with avocado and melted cheese. Each of these menu items were delicious and I did not feel that the kitchen skimped on the quantity at all. For those who love lamb, there were even a few menu items of this delicious meat -- very few restaurants carry this in Toronto, unless one goes to Greek Town, located between Pape & Broadview along Danforth Avenues"}
{"text":"Not a shabby place to hang out.  We came here for some wings and beer.  Beer? Great. The pint of roundwood was quite nice.  Wings, not too bad. The suicide wings were a little overcooked but actually quite spicy. I was pretty happy about that.   The service was friendly and the place was pretty busy on a Friday night. I won't be rushing back any time soon, but if I'm in the area and thirsty for a pint, this is a decent place to go to.  Apparently there's customer parking underground, but I found that sign a little too late."}
{"text":"I've been here twice during lunch time - the second time to overwrite my first experience (since this is close to work). The first time, the food AND service were terrible (very dry chicken wings). The second time, the service was exceptionally bad and the food good (the souvlaki wrap). I've found them to be short staffed (which is palatable if they're nice about it). Except, what you get is a blase, cold \"deal with it\" attitude which is very turning off.  If I really need to go back, I'll go for the souvlaki roll but get a take out instead."}
{"text":"Hats off to the chef- the Gnocchi Jambalaya was amazing, especially since the waitress asked me how spicy? i said im East Indian ..i can handle a lot, and i guess so was the chef. Probably the best Jambalaya i ever had. It changed me idea of how the dish is supposed to taste. I usually get the Jambalaya at Boston Pizza, but now that I have tried this it would be comparing Burgers Priest to McDonalds.  The ringwood beer was really great as well, sweet and went down smooth. Servers were friendly, and try to get seated by the fire place in the winter. Also there is a large mirror which is pretty trippy.  They have a extensive menu and are really accommodating to Vegetarians as well.. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I am really most sincerely baffled by all the positive reviews this place gets. We couldn't sit on the patio (private party), so that may have made a difference in our overall experience. Certainly the grim (not charming or quaint) decor from the 1980s didn't make downing some barely mediocre microbrews any more pleasant. But the food was just plain meh. It was edible, sure, but bland and unoriginal. At least the server was friendly. ... On the whole then, it's definitely not a place for the young and trendy.... Or the not so young and me, since I won't be back."}
{"text":"Granite brewer feels less like a brewpub and more like an old English pub. I recently came here on a Saturday night with a couple of friends. We came here for a post dinner drink so this review is based not on their food but on their beer (we did order a dessert).   For beer we got a sampler of 9 of their house beers (and 1 root beer), the sampler was very reasonably priced at $11.75. Unfortunately none of their beers really blew me away, one of their IPA's was pretty good, the Irish stout was true to the style but other than that the beers really lacked any complexity of flavour which I have grown used to from the local craft beer scene. The house made root beer was delicious and easily my favourite \"beer\" of the night.  My friend did want to order dessert so we ended up getting a slice of carrot cake with whisky sauce. The cake was delicious, sweeter than your average carrot cake, it was very moist and the whiskey sauce added a nice caramel flavour, this was a hit and I'm pretty sure I ended up eating most of it.   The restaurant itself is pretty large with a huge dining area in the back and a small room in the front. It is definitely fashioned in the style of an English pub with bookshelves and a fireplace, all in all quite cozy. The service was satisfactory, our drinks and food were fetched quickly. Overall the beers at Granite are nothing to write home about but if you are looking for a cozy spot to hang out at for a reasonable price (especially for the area) then it may be worth a visit."}
{"text":"I went here on Thanksgiving Monday and it was the most depressing thing ever. The restaurant was filled with old people (and by filled I mean 1/20 full). There's no fancy decor or sense of pride about the ambiance here. And the food was god awful.   We ordered the thanksgiving meal, turkey, potatoes, stuffing, veggies, cranberry. The veggies were obviously of the frozen variety, the mashed potatoes were chunky (which I guess is nice, because it means they weren't instant) and the turkey tasted processed beyond belief. The beer sampler was pretty good, but like Brad said, none of them stood out (although the root beer was tasty). The service was pretty terrible. The waitress seemed frazzled and disinterested in serving us, and there was a ridiculous procession involving there being no pumpkin pie. Then there was pumpkin pie, then there was no pumpkin pie. Eventually we got our pumpkin pie but I was so sick from the crappy food I didn't care.   They might have better food on non-special occasions but I wouldn't recommend this place for a Thanksgiving meal - or for a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Beer: Really good, house micro- brew Food: Adequate, but definitely not gastro-pub Service: Good. Very friendly staff Patio: amazing patio in the back, like an oasis in the city. Small front patio as well Inside: Was probably really nice once, but now is aged and feels like an old age home dining room (especially the back area).  Parking: Free underground parking Kids: amazing place for kids. Friendly staff, kids menu. Fast service.  Groups: very big place...great for an after-game team outing."}
{"text":"Food here is classic pub grub, so definitely nothing upscale. I got the taco and it was okay and hit the spot, but my expectations weren't really that high to begin with.  The selection of beers fell flat. We got a flight of beers and it was all pretty watery. Would not recommend for beer-enthusiasts. We selected a hop-focused beer and it tasted more watery than a typical Coors."}

{"text":"Came here for a retirement party the other night.  As noted by Mitch S. the atmosphere was 'meh.'  We were fed the hors d'oeuvres of the Granite Brewery. Once again, another 'meh.' Cut up vegetables, samosas from Costco and thin pieces of cheddar cheese ...  I don't drink alcohol anymore, but the watered down, overpriced fountain drink was okay I guess.  In Toronto, I've experienced better. When I retire, my party won't be here."}
{"text":"Wow, I totally forget about this place--which is too bad because based on the one time I tried it, it was really good.  It was either Vday or St. Patty's Day or something like that back in 2012.  I met a friend so we could eat (and have a drink) before whatever event (probably a lecture) at the Toronto Camera Club which is just down the street.  If memory serves, I had a Reuben sandwich or something similar.  I recall enjoying it.  The beer was certainly good.  I can't recall the value factor or service but I definitely made a mental note to return.  But I never did.  That is life in Toronto, right?  There are just too many choices.  And when you have to take 2+ TTC vehicles to get to a restaurant...well,  it is often easier to just find something in your own backyard.  Don't let me sway you against this place though.  if you are in the area, this is most certainly worth a visit.  And there is enough in the area (Vortex Records!) that would actually qualify this restaurant as a destination spot, especially if you are into beer.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"First of all the place has a dingy grammas house feel to it, especially in the back not even a TV nothing, its miserable. The food was sub par and VERY overpriced at $16.95 for a 'meh' meatloaf. The beer is...well, have you ever heard of granite beer? Steam Whistle, Amsterdam, Mill St... not Granite and for good reason. End of the day my wife and I spent $85 for a shitty night and will never be back."}
{"text":"As a craft beer guy, I was actually looking forward to visiting as this place has been open for over 25 years, brewing English styled ales in midtown Toronto. Prior to recent, midtown wasn't a frequent visiting spot so this place always escaped me.  From a venue perspective, they have a small streetside patio as well as a much more impressive back patio, complete with both sunny open tables and covered sections for the rain prevention. The inside of the place is more in the traditional restauranty pub vibe.   On to what matters... The beer. Their menu boasted about 10 different brews, and the flights are decently priced, coming in just over $9 after tax for 4 x 5oz samples. Oddly enough, the beer I like the most was the Ringberry. This is a crisp and clean drinking ale with a nice raspberry flavour infusion. It had character and smooth drinkability, and made a perfect patio beer to start the day with. The rest of the beers I tried weren't anything to write home about. The Galactic Pale Ale was the standout of the Pale Ales I tried. Of the 5 or so different Pale Ales or IPAs, the only one over 50 IBUS was the Black IPA (meh). It's also worth noting that a handful of the beers were cask conditioned, which admittedly can be a selling point if the beers are full flavoured and can deal without the added carbonation... But both the Hopping Mad and standard IPA I had were both lacking to me.  I didn't eat but will say the food menu was pretty massive with lots of options. As for if thats a good thing or not, I'll leave that for someone else to review. In the end, in the name of craft beer and patios, I'll still come back as Midtown Toronto doesn't have anything much to compete as of this point."}
{"text":"So let me explain why I gave the Granite Brewery 3 stars. Personally I think the pub lacks atmosphere and it feels more like a mediocre restaurant...Not a good quality for a pub...So that would earn it one or two stars maximum.  Although, as the name 'Brewery' would suggest, the beer here is quite good. I like the variety, the fact they brew it themselves, and that you can purchase it to bring home. I LOVE that the beer is actually quite good, probably the best draught you can get in the Yonge and Eglinton area. So that's a solid 4 stars.  Put it together and you get 3 stars! Go out and give it a try, expect awesome beer in a meh atmosphere."}
{"text":"Heard from a friend about this place a while ago, a bit out of the way but finally tried it in the summer (like 6m ago).   beer: A or A+. wide selection of beers for your enjoyment. try different ones! you are in a brewery!!!  decor: indoors is a bit... eccentric and slightly creepy.. sorry i don't like the two dolls sitting there. but oh my gawd the patio is to die for! go in the summer and sit on the patio, it's so pretty and peaceful i love it!!  food: meh. it's bar food. nothing was memorable. burgers and fries are ok, guess if you don't expect fantastic it's alright.  I'd come back for beer.. on the patio... maybe get fries."}
{"text":"I want to like the Granite more. But the food is over-seasoned/salty, there's too much reliance on prepackaged frozen sides (chips, hash browns, etc., pre-battered, tough, frozen calamari, etc.).   The craft beer is all over the map. Some is bland and almost tasteless; others are great. Ask for a taste before you commit to a pint.   With a kitchen that put some care into the old pub standards, and sources fresh ingredients, it could be a super spot."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing.  We had a huge party there last night and they were wonderful, food was great and a bunch of us stayed afterwards to eat and drink more the place was busy, but not noisy and you are always treated as if you are the only person there.  The food is always great quality, great price.  One of the best casual places in the city!!"}
{"text":"The beer passport app was what brought me here. The brewery felt very hidden as Mt Pleasant and Eglinton since there's ongoing construction all around.   At this brewery, you get to select cask beers, rotating drafts, and beers on tap, which was a bonus for me since you don't find very many breweries with all these selections. During our visit we tried the Galactic, Best Bitter, Lady MacBeth Scotch Ale, and Ringberry. They each REALLY had their own unique taste, and I really enjoyed all 4. We opted for 2lbs of chicken wings & fries ($24) to pair with the beers.   I'd love to come back and try their other options, or at the very least grab some bottles to go :)"}
{"text":"The food was good.  They had Malbec as a wine option.  The gentleman that served us was very very nice and friendly.  The have free parking!  I was very happy about this visit except there was a bit of a smell when walking into the place.  Other than that, I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's birthday and tried their Winterlicious menu for $28. I had the daily soup which was good. However, I was not impressed with their IPA braised lamb shank. It was a bit bitter and the sides were bland. I usually finish my food but the mash potatoes was not worth stomaching. The tiramisu was good but only the size of a fist. Didn't try their beer so I can't comment on if it was good. My friends did like their beer. The service was good though."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch and definitely has that pub-y type feel to it...with a non traditional menu.  They have curries!  I didn't try them, but others did and said it was good.  I has the almond crusted sole with basmati rice and cous cous (this is what the menu said, however I guarantee you that isn't what I got...it was more like orzo).  So either they ran out and didn't tell anyone...or they don't know what cous cous is.  The location at Yonge/Eg is great.  Central location to meet up with friends and just chill.  Which is what happened at lunch as the place was packed - and it is pretty big!  there is a certain charm to it, however it's just a laid back place.  If you want something special, keep on moving."}
{"text":"This place is consistently OK.  The food and the service is good but nothing special. I've had the ribs a few times and would recommend them.  The location of the bar and the fact that they brew onsite makes it a good place to grab a few beers with some friends, but unfortunately they close relatively early every single day so this place only works for me on weekends, at lunch - pretty restrictive that way."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, having had dinner 2x before. This restaurant has a cozy front dining area and a larger dining hall in the back!  The women's washroom is large, modern and clean.  In my different visits, I ordered the jerk chicken salad and the steak and portabello sandwich. Both items by themselves are filling dinner meals!  The steak sandwich is delicious but there is no need for bacon -in my opinion!! The bacon ruins it.  It's too many flavours and can turn it into a fatty mess in your intestines! I asked for the gravy on the side, so you can turn your sandwich into a less unhealthy meal.  The beers are great! The last time I was there, I ordered the Irish Roast Stout and yes, it has a strong coffee flavour. It also described a chocolate flavour but my palate could not pick up the chocolate hints.  In the past, I've had the raspberry beer which is soooo refreshing and fruity!   The servers are great. Friendly, professional and attentive."}
{"text":"I love the Granite Brewery and consider myself to be a loyal patron of this fine midtown establishment.  I've been visiting this pub for about a decade now, and absolutely adore their house-brewed craft beer.  They conveniently sell growlers of their beer to-go and you can take it home If you were so inclined.  The Ringwood pale ale is a favourite of mine, and I find myself constantly going back to it.  Their Jerk Chicken wings are incredible, and are undoubtedly my go-to choice when I am dining here.  I have also tried their burger, ribs, and steak and found them all to be exceedingly delicious.  Kudos to the Chef, he or she really knows what they're doing!    The service is great and attentive, the staff here is fantastic and I have never had a negative experience at this place over all the years I've been coming here.  Their patio in the back is really tranquil and a great place for brunch on a warm summer day."}
{"text":"I have no excuse for this place.  I don't get to it nearly enough and that is yet again a failing on my part.  I apologize.  Every time I have been up there I have always been treated to really good food, really tasty made-right-there beers, and staff that know what they're talking about.  The first time in here was completely on a whim, but the return trips have been more exacting.  The menu, as solid as any that you'd expect in a pub, is basic and tasty, and if nothing else, complements the beers brewed their quite easily.  Now the beers, well, here we go.  There's several different varieties on tap as well as some seasonal faves (e.g., summer ale, Oktoberfest).  My biggest problem is in my desire to reacquaint myself with the taps, I find myself running them, going from one to the next trying to determine what the best of the bunch are.  Two things happen.  First, my taste buds become so overwhelmed that I eventually cannot discern the last beer from the one before it.  Second, well, what do you think happens after a bunch of beer.  Do yourself a favour.  It's a five minute walk from the subway station.  Seize that opportunity.  I guess I could try to go through the taps in two or three successive trips, but my nose keeps bleeding when I go north of Bloor.  This place however is worth the jamming of tissue up the nostrils."}
{"text":"Went to the Granite Brewery on a Friday night around 7pm, with a party my in-laws, (4 adults 2 kids) for dinner. The back patio was full (which made me a little sad -- it's very nice back there!), so we opted to sit inside and were quickly seated. The decor inside is large but still feels like a cozy pub, with views into the brewing area.   Our party had various allergies to things like gluten and nuts plus two picky kids (you know how it is), and our server was very friendly, helpful and patient in taking our orders. They have a separate gluten-free menu as well.  The food overall was tasty. The nachos supreme ($16) was loaded with toppings and were not soggy at all, a common pitfall of pub nachos (they were also gluten free!). The fish and chips ($14 for 1 piece) came with a huge piece of fish and fresh cut fries, plus tartar sauce a bit of coleslaw. The french onion soup ($7) was cheesy goodness.  The only food that was a bit disappointing was the sausage rolls served with gravy ($10) -- they were the appetizer of the week. They seemed like Pilsbury pigs in a blanket with hot dogs in the center as opposed to a flaky pastry sausage roll that we were expecting.  As for the beer - we chose the cask conditioned IPA and the Ringwood blonde ale from their fairly wide selection of brews. Both were lightly carbonated and deliciously refreshing -- the IPA was only lightly hopped and the Ringwood was a perfect summer sipper. There is a bottle shop next door for those who just want to grab a growler and go.   I would definitely come back for solid pub food, service, and beer."}
{"text":"This is one of those reviews, where everything is, well, average.  Nothing to write home about and nothing to criticize.  The BEER:  I'm on the whole rather disappointed with their beer.  If you're tasting through the menu and start to wonder why it tastes so similar, there's a reason.  They have open-top fermentation, so they can only use 1 type of yeast in their brewery.  I find that this limitation really reduces the true-to-style nature of many of their beers.  The best were the ones on cask, but overall pretty underwhelmed.  The FOOD:  Firmly average burger and fries sort of joint.  Passable nachos of commercial chips.  Ribs were probably the best, but not worth the cost.  BTW, if you order your chicken wings spicy, they mean it...watch out!  The SERVICE:  We were a table of beer geeks that ended up getting served by a beer geek...that was definitely fun.  Despite the slightly alarming hipster-stache, he really knew his beer and brewed a lot himself.  He was also pretty good at facilitating some samples and comparison tastings.    OVERALL, this place is pretty average.  If you live near Yonge and Eg, and want to stay local, go for it.  If not, it's not worth it--it's nowhere in the league of say Bellwoods Brewery or Barhop."}
{"text":"Definitely great beer, best bitters was both our favorite brew. Ringberry is like juice that is a great patio beer fun and sweet. We got the steak wrap it was good and my spouse loved that they have veggie sticks. I got the Mediterranean turkey burger was very good with a butternut squash soul, which was so yummy. The crab cakes are all filler we were disappointed in that."}
{"text":"For a place so well located and spacious, it has immense potential, but alas it fails to deliver. The staff need training. It feels like I'm being served by a bunch of boy scouts. They clearly do not employ any professional servers. There doesn't seem to be any leadership or anyone qualified to really train these people. They're all equally oblivious. They mean well, but just don't know any better.  The food sounds great on the menu but invariably disappoints. I've had at least four different entrees there, each time hoping to hit a winner, but nope.  Atmosphere-wise, they're all over the place. No consistency. There is no way to tell what their target demographic is. Is it seniors or students or families or rich businessmen or the artsy crowd? They aren't even consistent on whether or not to play music. Some days they do, some days they don't.   It's too bad they can't decide on their branding and atmosphere, and train their staff accordingly, because in this neighbourhood, they could easily outdo the other establishments, but they really fall short."}
{"text":"The beer here is underwhelming, but otherwise, it's a neat place. Definitely an older crowd, and a little dated in terms of decoration and ambience, but in a quaint way.   The beers all taste the same and were super underwhelming. Alternately, my friend ordered a mixed drink and said it was quite good.   The food was your average pub fare, and it tasted good! Service was super friendly, and accommodating.   There is parking under the restaurant, so don't bother trying to find it along the street."}
{"text":"I've been to Granite Brewery a few times now. The service varies, from occasionally very slow to average to good. I like the food here, which is like classic pub grub.   Most recently I had the Drunken Mac and Cheese with bacon and jalapenos. It was a smaller serving than you'd expect, but probably a good size considering all the fattening ingredients! But maybe it could come with a side of vegetables? It tastes really good, and is the perfect amount of heat. I think the cheese could be sharper, but I just really sharp cheese. I also really like their quesadillas. The Key Lime Pie (my favourite dessert) was delicious, a good size to share between two, but probably no more than that.   I recommend going in the summer when you can sit on the back patio."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in TO for a number if reasons and what has prompted me to finally start a yelp account. They are my favorite microbrewery in the city.  Beer: The ringwood ale is a very agreeable and unique beer even for people who aren't beer drinkers. I highly recommend it if you don't fancy the more bitter beverages.   Food: I can't say much about the food since I order thr same thing every time (suicide wings extra crispy) but I have heard good things from people I bring and recognize some regulars who must enjoy it. The suicide wings are my favorite wings in Toronto and the reason I frequent The Granite. They have a good taste, you break a decent sweat,  but they aren't as painful as Duff's top two flavours.  Service: Friendly staff that knows their stuff. The first time I went they gave me a few complimentary 2 oz beer samplers while I took my time figuring out which one I preferred. Low turnover from what I can see."}
{"text":"Really wide menu with lots of daily specials - large seating area and free parking in the lower level.  A good feed with gernerous serving, - great onion rings.  Service is pretty zippy and friendly/ highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday afternoon for lunch on the patio. (We were hoping to check out the back garden but it was closed in preparation for a private event.) The inside of the restaurant has a cozy pub feel, seems like it'd be a nice place to come for a drink during the winter.   The majority of the beers here are pretty hoppy (IPA section on the menu is quite large) but yesterday I tried the ringwood and summer ale which were both tasty and I imagine less bitter than a lot of the other options. Food is average, I had the chicken souvlaki wrap and my boyfriend had a club sandwich - we both thought they were fine but a little dry. We had a 2 for 1 entrees coupon which influenced our decision to go here (although the max cost was $12 and both our sandwiches were over $12 - so we got a discount on bill rather than actual 2 for 1 deal). Overall a totally okay experience but certainly nothing special - if I'm looking for a patio lunch in the neighbourhood I'll probably go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am really surprised at the bad reviews -- this is one of my favourite spots.  The menu is what I'd call extended pub food. There are the requisite burgers, sandwiches, wings, etc. with some more elaborate pastas, stir fries, pub curries, and steaks. There's nothing really unique or fancy, but it's all done really well and it's all fresh. The fries are real fresh-cut potatoes with the peels on, and they are to die for. (The only thing on the menu that isn't really edible is the pizza -- overcooked and too salty. Then again, I rarely expect that a restaurant that isn't a pizzeria will have good pizza.)  A couple of people mentioned having brunch there and the service was bad. I've never been in for brunch, but I know that the dinnertime-and-later staff are great guys who are friendly and always remember what we order. I love the atmosphere, it's quiet and relaxing and warm, and not pretentious or fake.  The beers are all phenomenal, especially the Old Peculiar and the Gin Lane barley wine. They've got nine different varieties altogether, with a couple that are seasonal. At under $6 a pint before tax and tip, it's affordable as brew pubs go.  Yes, there may be an older demographic there sometimes. It is not hip, swinging, or happening. It's Mount Pleasant, what do you expect? Get over it, and have some really good beer and food."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place since before I moved to Toronto, and was glad to find out last night that it's still a great spot for fantastic food and beer.  The service was quick, super friendly, and everything was as good as could be expected.  Too bad there aren't more craft brew places like this in North Toronto."}
{"text":"You may be thrown by the old gungy looking decore when you first enter. I was, but my friend insisted that their food was good so I gave it a go. It turned out that the food was not bad indeed. I have been back a few times now and have developed a few favourites. The stuffed chicken is quite yummy, their burgers are pretty huge and tastey, and the beer is good. I have also tried their fries supreme, and that definitely got a two thumbs up.  The service is mostly nice and helpful. They have free wifi, which is convenient and there is plenty of room to sit.  Honestly, if they upgraded the decore just a little bit, and maybe dusted, I would give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"I went in here Sunday morning... I guess they have a Sunday breakfast buffet that goes on every week. I took a peak at it and it looked decent, but I was there to try the beer. Beer and eggs just didn't sound too good to me.   My fiancée and I ordered the beer flight of all 8 beers and the root beer along with an appetizer sampler. Over all none of the beers were that impressive. The stout was the only one I remember being pretty good, but the best one was their root beer. The price for the beer sampler was really good I think it was only $10. But my biggest problem with Granite was the service was terrible. I know it was Sunday morning / afternoon but there was only like six tables and two waitresses.   If you're a beer nut and have to try all the brewery's in Toronto then give Granite a try. Or if you're working at DraftFCB and looking for a lunch spot then Granite could work for you. But if you ask me just go to Mill Street and skip Granite. Granite Brewery isn't that great and pretty far from the downtown."}
{"text":"Meh. We only had nachos - but they were not great and that's being polite. The cider and beer were fine, but the service was awkward and not very friendly or warm.  The space inside is quite large so it would be good for a large gathering, but not if anyone is particular about food or service."}
{"text":"Granite Brewery is a micro-brewery at Mt Pleasant and Eglinton and despite only opening at 11:30am on Sunday, they make a pretty good brunch. They also have lots of seating and is great for booking off for large groups.  The chicken souvlaki was a bit dry, but the brunch fare was great. The lobster mac'n'cheese was cheesy and greasy with lots of chunks of lobster. The crispy avocado wedges were just right between soft and crispy. The sauce that came with the crispy avocado wedges was great too, a sort of chipotle mayo. Currently, they have a Winterlicious menu on which is pretty good for lunch when we went.  Free parking makes it easy to organize gatherings - you just need to tell them how many people you have. The underground parking entrance is located on east side of Avenue Rd, south of Eglinton. If you see the Shoppers Drug Mart, the parking garage entrance is immediately to the left of it. Grab a ticket and drive in. You will need to remember to get a token to leave!"}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper tonight at the Granite Brewery with friends.  Gord had Drunken Macaroni and Cheese (without jalapenos).  He said it was goodand he'd get it again.  I had Butter Chicken Curry.  It was also good and there was a bit of a bite to it.  I'd get it again.  Natasha was our server and she took good care of us."}
{"text":"I never knew about this place until a friend recommended we go for Summerlicious. We were out on the patio on a Sunday afternoon for a $15 meal. Couldn't ask for anything more....that is until I saw their beer menu.....Bloody brilliant.   I'd label this place as a diamond in the rough. Great food, great service, great times had by all."}
{"text":"Good beer and I'm glad to have a microbrewery in midtown, but this place was still disappointing. My server didn't know much about the beer on tap so couldn't really offer an informed recommendation, and something I love about brew pubs is the server's usual enthusiasm for beer. The food was uninspired, as was the decor, which is just your typical dark wood pub style. This place needs a makeover. Check out what others are doing, like Bar Volo, Indie Ale House, and Bandit Brewery. I think this place has potential but not if it continues as it has for the past 30 years. They also have a small retail shop in the bar where you can purchase cans and growlers. They're open on stat holidays, which is a plus."}
{"text":"I did not like  beer very bland, poor service and very dirty.  The place had a very bad smell. Will never go back."}
{"text":"My partner and I had our wedding reception at the Granite and the five stars are specifically in regards to our wedding.  It was a fantastic low-stress experience and I would recommend the Granite Brewery to anyone looking for an in-town (and therefore transit accessible), all-inclusive event venue that doesn't require a lot of work or input to make it happen.  We found Ron and the whole staff very accommodating for our needs (dietary restrictions for the menu, dropping off centerpieces and a card box a few hours early on the day of, they printed out and posted our seating chart because we didn't care about making a fancy one).  Overall, it seemed like we were welcome to customize things where we needed to or wanted to, but we weren't bombarded with options or encouraged to over think it.  Several of our guests complimented us on the reception venue.  Our (gluten-free) dinner was great.  None of our friends drink the domestic beer that would have been served at most of the venues we first found, so the beer here was a welcome highlight!  The staff who worked our wedding could not have been any friendlier than they already were.  Most importantly, we felt taken care of and like we didn't need to worry about anything.  It looked fantastic, too.  We provided flowers for the tables but otherwise didn't try to decorate or compete with the room.  I would especially recommend the Granite Brewery to anyone who just wants to get married without worrying about a lot of things."}
{"text":"I agree with my esteemed reviewing colleague Vanessa G.  This place is grim, dark and strangely desperate.  I can recommend it only to those returning from a long sea voyage with nothing to their name except gift certificates to this place.  (Sometimes pirates pay out in gift certificates, I hear.)  Anyway, the decor is old and faded and vinyl; ambiance is non-existent.  The food, for its part, is somewhere between semi-edible and uninteresting and while the service is with a smile, it's nothing to write home about.  It dawned on me as I ate there that everyone in the restaurant, staff and patrons alike, looked a bit glum - as if we were in a Siberian Gulag kitchen in the winter of 1921, doomed to another six months without sunlight, wrapped in used medical bandages (used by others) for warmth.  Yes that's it!  Imagine someone transplanted a prison from last-century Siberia, added a bit of Pseudo-Country Flavour and plunked it all down in Mid-Town Toronto.  Not good.  I half expected the library ghost from Ghostbusters to appear in one of the dark recesses of this place, paging through War and Peace - a novel as tedious as the restaurant itself.  Dostoyevsky himself would give the place a look and decide it was TOO depressing.  I suppose I shouldn't expect much seeing as this place's specialty is its beer, not its food.  But come on - you've got restaurant in the name...let's renovate once every 37 years and maybe shake up the kitchen a bit, shall we?  That's a nice restaurant.  Don't cry!  There there.  One day you'll fix yourself up! (Or close down)"}
{"text":"So the Granite has been around for 25 years and the decor certainly reflects that! Don't be thrown off by that and all of the blue-hairs frequenting the place (there literally is a retirement home across the street) because the beer and food is fantastic.  I live at Yonge and Eglinton and when I want a relaxing beer and a good bite to eat I walk to the Granite....far better pub food than it's surrounding competitors (Scruffy Murphy's, Fox & Firkin, The Unicorn) and far better beer too!"}
{"text":"We were married at the Granite October 8th,2017. From the moment we stepped in there just looking for a place to get married we loved this special place.  The service, the food and the drinks are consistently great!! You always feel welcome there like you are a friend not only a customer. Ron the owner was so easy to speak with and help plan the wedding. He put up with my many questions and was always kind. I do not know all the staff names there but they were all fantastic.   Special shout out to Chris!!!  You are amazing and we miss you.  We need to get in there for drinks and dinner and see you.. We highly recommend this place for a wedding.  It was a perfect day.  The sun was shining and we married outside in the back courtyard which is a little slice of heaven. The dinner which was a buffet was delicious and the party was great.  Drinks were flowing , people were laughing and the dance floor full. We would not change a thing. Thank you Granite Brewery!! Tara and Dan"}
{"text":"Granite Brewery is a fancy restaurant with their fancy wood and fancy wallpaper. Definitely not a plain-looking restaurant.   We got their 2lbs of Mild Wings and shared a Cuban Sandwich. The Cuban Sandwich tasted way better than I expected, will probably order it again. The Wings were pretty big than normal and very fried.  Servers were very cool and polite.  Washrooms were cleaner than I expected."}
{"text":"Gorgeous June day, and we're looking for a restaurant with a patio. Granite Brewery turned out to be perfect. Huge shady canopy overlooking a courtyard full of trees and singing birds, next to a sunny set of umbrella tables and a big colourful wall mural. Saw groups of relaxed people of all ages chattering happily and enjoying the food and drink. My three course meal which included a steak in brandy mushroom sauce, garlic mashed potatoes, and SURPRISE! brussel sprouts perfectly done was succulent and flavourful. The waiter was caring, attentive and knowledgeable as he gave my daughter her first Shandy, which she really liked. They were out of the advertised pecan pie dessert, but offered a photo-worthy chocolate cheesecake with whipped cream and blueberry pie with vanilla ice cream. No one was disappointed.  We are definitely going back; this is truly a summer place."}
{"text":"Maybe it's unfair of me to review a brewpub when I don't really drink.    But then, nobody says I'm obligated to imbibe, and if they have wait staff, and a menu, and food, they're faire game, right?   Anyway, unless they're serving skunked-out old beer, or the keg pressure's too high/low, or the temperature's just off a pint is a pint is a pint. Especially if I feel like a bottle of Corona or two to go with my nachos.   So I'll stipulate that I haven't tried their in-house brews. Instead I met up with friends for a decidedly Jack-and-Coke evening. The Jack and Coke was great, considering Jack had left the building.   The Granite is a huge sprawling space at the corner of Eglinton and Mount Pleasant. Ample parking is undermined by a byzantine payment scheme that requires you to leaver the garage, traipse outside and then re-enter the building. Or you could just bus in from Eglinton Station. Or walk.   The vibe is split between committed older drinkers, locals blowing off steam, and during the summer, newly of-age kids (I presume) who find drinking in such a hangout a really grown-up thing to do.   Service about what you'd expect. Lots of offers to top off drinks (alcohol and otherwise), and long waits for food. Did I mention the nachos? Good, because I had to a few times on this visit. They arrived lukewarm, a pile of greasy loose meat on stale crumbling chips, blanketed with cheese and a few loose veggies; altogether inconsistent but I'm sure awesome if it were my first time in a bar, or if my palate wore beer goggles."}
{"text":"This place is grotty and depressing. What is needs is a good dusting and some refurbishing. It reminds me of an East London pub where the old men hang about smoking cigarettes, betting on horses and asking me to \"shake me arse...(luv)\".  I'm getting itchy just writing this review.  They did have a large uninventive pub food menu. I didn't eat anything but everyone else's food looked pretty mediocre, and it came out a bit too fast, which is never a good sign. Cold fries.  The serverwasn't particularly friendly but he got the job done."}
{"text":"The restaurant is much larger than it looks upon walking in. The bar section is very small but there are plenty of tables and booths and an outside patio.   Service was very friendly. I told the server I was vegan, and he was very knowledgable of the menu and what I could eat. The pasta was good. Nothing amazing. My friend really enjoyed his veggie burger and the fries were pretty tasty.   There were a ton of beer options, since it was a brewery. The server was able to point me towards the fruity ones and I actually enjoyed some of them! Normally, I don't like beer.   Overall fine experience. Nothing outstanding but good."}
{"text":"Excellent food and nice selection of beers and cider. Great service and atmosphere. Enjoyed our 20th anniversary meal before going to guns n roses."}
{"text":"Guys. The granite is not great by any means.   Well-located, yea.  Decent in-house brews, sure.  But it's downhill from there.  The place closes kind of early. No more drinks after 11:30 on a Saturday (huh?) and kitchen closes by midnight. Weird.  We just managed to get a platter and PLEASE BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY the crab cakes had me doing uncivilized things for two days straight. I'm talking MILD FOOD POISONING and severe everything-out-now-ness.   I share this not to humiliate myself but to spare you the gastro-implosion.   Apart from two crab cakes (that's all it took), I had two wings. It was all tasteless. Oh, except the sweet potato fries. Those were ok.  Just keep walking down Mt Pleasant for real crab cakes and stay closer to Yonge and Eg for proper wings and a better beer selection.   I RECOMMEND- only having alcohol. I tasted one house beer I would describe as a light and flat Heineken and had some decent red wine.   EXTRA TIP- no smoking on the patio."}
{"text":"Served by Evan, such an enthusiastic great guy. We ordered from the lunch menu. Steak rare, chicken sandwich and the salmon filet. The food for pub grub was amazing, so full of flavour. Although it is a bar/pub mainly which I have been to thousands I think my second experience here today was one of the best. Thanks Evan and see you again soon. Ps....We were not friends until today."}
{"text":"2.5 Star  The Beer Flight ($11.75) for 9 samples + root beer is definitely a bargain at Granite Brewery & Restaurant.   However, I found most of their beer they brewed lacks character and personally I am not a fan.  The Carrot Cake with whiskey sauce and whipped cream ($5.99) on the other hand was a winner. I only able to have 1 bite and then the whole slice was gone so fast...  Granite Brewery does feel dated, maybe it is its charm but it is definitely not my pint of beer!"}
{"text":"The Granite Brewery has been doing it for longer than almost any other microbrewery in Toronto. This is one of my favourite spots in the neighbourhood. We tend to make it out once every other month or so and I've brought beer-loving family from out of town.  The decor is not fancy: classic pub in the front, Grandma's basement in the back. But it is really comfortable. A great place to bring kids too; we never feel uncomfortable and we can usually get a reservation for a large group on fairly short notice.  The food is average, above average on a few items. My personal favourites are macaroni and cheese with jalapeno and bacon, and the fish and chips. Where this place stands out is the beer, no surprise. My favourite is the Galactic Pale Ale, which is hoppy without overwhelming. Not a lot of new hipster beer styles like sours, Granite brewery focuses more on classic English pub varieties. They have a Bitter on the menu and I just tried a Mild on a rotating tap.  In short, a great family spot with great beer."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there to check out their Winterlicious menu. I had read a bunch of reviews and more or less knew what to expect. Overall, I side with the more positive reviews on this place.   Beer:  My husband was excited to find a local brew pub (we're new to the area). He tried two beers--their stout and the Peculiar. He's had better stouts, but the Peculiar he really liked. I tried the root beer and it was definitely tasty.   Food:  With the Winterlicious menu, the best part was definitely the mains. Our starters were pretty tiny and nothing terribly special. The regular-menu starters definitely looked better. This was in part due to my terrible, brain-dead decision to order a tomato-bocconcinni salad in January... But then again, maybe they shouldn't have even put it on the menu!  Our mains were good, though, and even a step up from the expected pub fare. My husband had a butter chicken, which was probably one of the better butter chickens we've had. I had a braised lamb shank--very tasty, tender and excellent value for the Winterlicious menu. There were options on the regular menu that looked tasty, too.  Dessert was... fine. Not bad, not spectacular.   Service:  We found the service to be excellent. We ate up by the bar area. The staff there were super friendly and attentive, quickly (but not obnoxiously) clearing our plates after each course and checking on our drink levels. There was a private party in the library area, but this didn't affect the attention given to us at all.  Decor:  Again I say, it's a pub! It's nothing spectacular, but it was cozy enough to have a casual dinner. The library room also looked nice. We didn't see the main dining room.   Overall:  We'd definitely go back. It was a chill place to hang out with friendly service, good beer and decent enough food! If you're looking for a fancier, foodier meal, I'd go elsewhere, but for a casual meal with some good beer and relaxed atmosphere, this is not a bad choice!"}
{"text":"I came here once and the service and atmosphere were fine, but the food was pretty awful.  Like something I could have made myself in five minutes in college.  The beer is nothing special either."}
{"text":"Tried out the local brew pub and sadly was disappointed with the Granite Brewery.  They are celebrating their 25th anniversary and the beer and menu are that old.  The beer they brew is old school style and the menu uninspired. They seem to be resting on their laurels when they could be so much more. They are in a great midtown location, have an amazing rear outdoor patio and ample space to accommodate large groups. The service was lackluster and not responsive to my basic needs.   Each of their beers have the same note, my meal was flavorless and I feel overpriced based on other local options. I would like to recommend them but I cannot. I say keep on walking down The street to some fab restaurants.   Cheers"}
{"text":"Excellent Beer .... good spot to relax and spend time with friends... I live in this area and it is really convince to pick up beer. They open until late, which is a good advantage  I like the IPAD beer and the berry beer (which is most of the time they just have it during summer)"}
{"text":"So it's really simple. I walked in and sat at the bar. The beer I ordered was terrible, waste of $7. My fault I ordered it, I put it off the side to make sure Kevin the bartender would see I wasn't pleased, he didn't ask thus he didn't care.  The chicken wings I ordered were burnt, not my fault, but since the bartender didn't have the courtesy to ask about why I pushed my beer off to the side I figured that I wouldn't get any sympathy for the wings so I ate them.  Then, after I put down my credit card, it felt like a thousand years before I was attended to...especially annoying when the bartender walked back and forth 15 times and the credit card machine was in plain view.  So that was my experience, I was never a big fan but this was the last straw for me, I will never go back."}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious...and for a pub...the food was superb! I ordered a lamb shank dish...amazing...and my fiancé ordered a chicken makani dish...also amazing! We were surprised how good the Indian dish tasted despite it not being an Indian restaurant. Service was quick. The server wasn't the friendliest but was knowledgable about the beers. If you're into milder beers, try the ring wood and gin pale ale! Very tasty."}
{"text":"How have I not tried this place before now?  A 5 minute walk from my house and I can leave with a Growler?? Yes, please! We went in on a Saturday evening for a few beers and snacks. I've walked by here before, and it's never looked particularly busy, but maybe that's because everyone is enjoying the great patio in the back. Again, HAD I BUT KNOWN!   I'm not usually one for sweet beers/cidres, but the Ringberry was fantastic. After getting a sampler, I ordered a whole pint! We also tried the Hopping Mad, the Summer Ale, Peculiar, and the Irish Stout - all of which were great, but the ringberry was, by far, my fave! We also ordered a massive basket of fries (for $5!!), add a side of chipotle mayo and I left very happy and relaxed!"}
