{"text":"So native Beijingers don't go to dayali for Beijing duck or anything of that sort, and no wonder why because their ducks don't even stand a chance against regular Chinatown BBQ places. The skin was dry and the meat even a bit hard to chew through. In fact Cantonese restaurants are way better at getting the authenticity right. Frankly the other dishes were the basics a babysitter in china could cook. Maybe it was just our choices.   The wait was definitely not worth waiting for, kinda felt bad for people waiting outside, hope you've a better time. My friend got a VIP card when it first opened and wanted to get rid of it before our course ended. In Beijing, dayali is a little run down, but all of a sudden it becomes extravagantly decorated in Toronto, honestly not worth going for the facade."}
{"text":"I like Dayali... but only for the Peking duck. The rest of the food is extremely greasy, subpar and lacking in flavour. Even my friends who don't eat Chinese food that often can notice the difference between the food at Dayali compared to the food at other restaurants like Asian Legend in Toronto. As other reviewers have noted, the service at Dayali leaves much to be desired. I find if you don't speak Mandarin, it is difficult to get anyone's attention.   All this being said, I do like the Peking duck here. The duck here reminds me of the ones in Beijing, which is difficult to find here in Toronto. Unfortunately that's the only thing that I like to eat here.    Also worth noting - the VIP card does not work at both Toronto locations. I.e. the Dayali card that you bought at the Gibson Drive location will not be accepted at the new Hwy 7 location.   Food - 7/10 Service - 5/10 Atmosphere - 8/10 Value - 6/10 Overall - 6.5/10"}
{"text":"Excellent roast duck! The restaurant in Beijing had thinner and even crispier skin, but this is probably the closest we'll get in North America. Service is ehh...not great, not horrible. You'll need to be a little aggressive to get staff attention, whatever, I came here for the food not the service."}
{"text":"I had been to this one three times. The food is great and tasty. Last time we went, one got food poisoning badly!  Dec 2015 I went and had dinner with friends. We ordered Deep fried Pear, Signature Roast Duck, Steamed Lotus Root Stuffed w Sweet Sticky Rice,  Fried Sweet Potatoes w Salted Egg Yolk, and a Tofu soup with Egg Yolk. The food tasted good, so before we get the bill, we bought a membership card to save a bit.   However, one friend experienced food poisoning symptom around 2~3 hours after the dinner but the rest were okay as they did not eat much. From the packed dishes, we found the Tofu soup had the problem, a few slice of Tofu were BAD!  I give it a 3stars as the food tasted good and price is fair. But the food poisoning is not fun. I will not go there although I just got the membership.   I can give the membership away if anybody needs it.."}
{"text":"ULTIMATE SCAM   If it was possible to give a zero star this restaurant certainly deserves it. When they advertise buy one roast duck and get second free, they present you with a \"coupon\" to redeem the free roast duck at your next visit. Let me just say, when i went to go redeem the coupon on the next visit i was told in order to use the coupon i have to pay tax on the regular value of the duck and 30% gratitude on the entire bill.   Overall, your \"free\" coupon is a scam. The tax part is arguable and debatable, but the \"required\" 30% gratitude on the entire bill to USE the coupon is quit pathetic.   Save your time and go somewhere else with better service and not a money grab."}
{"text":"It's new and it become my fav since my first visit. During past month, my friend and I had been there at least 5 or 6 times. very good food at low price.   BTW, I only be there at lunch time so far, because all my other friends told me the dinner time are too many people, unacceptable waiting time"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst peking duck I had in my life.  We asked for the difference between the regular duck and their gold duck. The answer was we get some extras side dishes. We say ok lets go for the best. So we were told the wait time was about 20mins. It took almost 40. When the food came, there was little plates of the usual stuff that you eat with pekin duck. Are some grapes, crunchy dough, and spices worth the extra? No. We felt being ripped off. Now the food does not taste better than others places we tried that included the soup and lettuce wraps for the same price. Service is slow and non existent. I`m dumbfounded that ppl are still lining up at this place."}
{"text":"Food was decent but two stars Bc the service here is absolutely terrible. Servers don't listen and ignore your table. Empty dishes piled up Bc the servers are not removing them when the new dishes arrive. Don't bother refilling or bringing you hot tea. Due to the lack of service and care free attitude of the management I would never come back."}
{"text":"First of all, when we arrived at the restaurants, there were a lot of people waiting at the front gate. After we took the number from the front desk, it took us approximately half an hour to be seated.  I wouldn't say the environment is fabulous but I am Chinese so I don't really expect anything spectacular from a Chinese restaurant. We ordered the Beijing grilled duck, which is not bad. But it is not comparable from the one I had in China.  The skin there is crispier.  The tastes of spicy chongqjng chicken and the mao xie wang are fair. The steamed Xiao long bao is not really juicy. In a word, the food taste is just fine and don't expect a wow because they are not really gourmet styled.  If I want to eat Chinese food one day and it is nearby,  I would go to this restaurant but it is definitely not worthy of driving for like one hour just for that.  Oh by the way, despite that majority of the restaurants in Major big cities in China accept credit cards, they only take cash or debit card here, which is not surprising for me."}
{"text":"Only come before for the duck. It tasted good but they don't slice it in front of you which should be part of the experience, I believe.  The rest of the dishes were definitely subpar. Service is slow (other than food service). The place is usually crowded.  Cash or debit only, be aware."}
{"text":"Really tast good, they are original north Chinese tast. I like this restaurant so much. I will often go there."}
{"text":"Terrible duck. I ordered the Peking duck and asked to have the duck cut up into pieces after the duck is skinned. Well, the skins were served hot as they should be, but the bones were stone cold. I don't get it. Only way for this to happen would be the duck was pre-made (as supposed to made-to-order), and they microwave the skin but forgetting to microwave the bone. And they don't let you see the waitress skinning the duck like in other restaurants, so you really can't tell if everything was already pre-made in the kitchen. We complained to the waitress and asked to have the bones corrected, the waitress willingly took the dish back to the kitchen, no problem here, but the bones were returned to us in less than two minutes - piping hot. Horray to microwave technology. So clearly the Peking duck was not authentic, this place is over rated.   Lastly too much MSG. We ordered the garlic broccoli and my tongue was numbed after eating only half of the dish."}
{"text":"Very very very very awful service. None of the wait staff ever cracked a smile. One waitress spilled soup over my 5 year old son, did not apologize, made a face like I was wrongly accusing her, and simply walked away. The duck was average, but paid twice the money one expect to pay for Peking duck. And they charge extra for everything from the sauce to scallions, one dollar per item. And you need to buy a three year membership to qualify for a lower menu price. Very gimmick, probably to lock you in so you have to go back, even with the extra poor service. Not recommended. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"The most disgusting Chinese food in Toronto, all dishes were flooded with oil, service was extremely bad and it was wasting our time to wait for a table. Cutleries were very dirty and dishes came 45mins after ordering.   We had few time of serious diarrhea immediately after the dinner.   I would never ever come back even for free. For your own health, please please please don't come here!"}
{"text":"I signed up Yelp today just to write a brief review about this dreadful, rotten to the bone restaurant.  Didn't get a chance to try the food, nor carefully observe the decor. In fact, we only stayed for 3 minutes. The attitude of the waitress was appalling to a point it was actually comedic and entertaining, and worth writing a review about.       One of the chairs had some liquid stuff on it, so we asked the waitress to exchange the chair for us. She responded by tossing us a paper towel, and rudely tells us \"Clean it yourself\".  Outraged as I was, I actually did try to clean it. But it turns out the liquid was some kind of syrup or sticky paste. The end result was the paper towel getting ripped and cemented all over the chair. I than address the issue to the waitress again, trying hard to maintain my composure, asked her in an unreasonably polite manner to switch the chair for me. Unfortunately it was a futile effort. She went berserk on me like I just killed her dog or something, and says \"There is a chair right beside you, change it yourself!!\" That very moment I decided I am done here. I don't care if the taste of their duck can elevate you to an orgasmic phase, I am outta here. As we were leaving, I can still here her yelling, what she said was something like WTF if translated in English.        If anyone of you got a fetish for extreme bad service, or an awesome in-your-face yelling, I would strongly recommend this restaurant. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"PEEEEKIIIIINNNGGG DUCK!!!!! Best in the city...skin is super crispy and meat is still juicy and flavourful....other dishes I had were great also....think it was braised cabbage with pork belly and a spicy stew type dish with sausage pork and veggies. Place is great as you find different dishes than your typical Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is just bad. Okay, not just bad, REALLY bad. I consider myself somewhat of a Connoisseur of chinese cuisine, and this place is maybe the worst i have come across in a long time in the gta.   Here is why;  Its new looking, and well appointed with fancy chandeliers, but dont let that fool you. Look up CLOSE and you will see that the place is actually filthy. We got there just when the place opened, at 11:30 on a sunday morning, and the chairs we were seated in were clearly dirty, and we had to wipe them down with wet wipes. There was also some wierd looking plum on the floor under the chair. I casually inspected a few other tables and they clearly had the same problem. Im guessing its because saturday night is a busy night and they didnt have time to clean up. Not a good start.    We had a group of 5, so ordered a few dishes. I will comment on a few. The Peking duck was good. Not great, but adequate. You would expect however that for $40 you would get a bit more than just the first usual course of the cut up outer part, but also some part of the rest of the duck made into another dish or at least the meat pieces by themselves on a separate plate; but no, there was no second duck dish forthcoming which was very disappointing. Many chinese restaurants cut up the rest of the duck and turn it into a supplementary dish or dice it up and let you eat it with lettuce pieces... Not this place though. Its clearly a money grab. They use the rest in other dishes for extra $ flow. I should also mention that they dont cut up the duck in front of you, which is the usual way i have seen it done. Are you actually getting a whole duck, which is what you pay for? Maybe, but i suspect probably not.... Just an observation.   Next egregious error imho was the fried rice. You would think fried rice is a dish that you cant screw up, but they manage. We got the shrimp/pork fried rice. It was just aweful. Minimal if any shrimp or pork, and the rice was dry and hard, and lumpy; it looked like it was thrown together VERY quickly, with no attention to how it actually turned out. It was bland and tasteless. A disaster dish. Embarrassing for a chinese restaurant to put out.   Final dish i will mention is a lamb dish. Lamb is a difficult meat to cook properly, so its not a surprise the amateurs in this kitchen would totally screw it up. Seasoning is important to any dish, but dumping  haf a pound of chilli peppers on top of a random meat is not seasoning. Its just wrong. It removes any other flavor that may (or may not) have been there. Just amateur.   On top of all of that, the service is slow, and certainly not with a smile. Better bring cash or debit card too, as thats the only payment they will accept, just to make sure they gauge you for every last cent they can.   If you are looking for quality chinese food in the area there sre much, much, much better choices in the area that are equally nice, better priced, and more importantly have much better food.   Im am writing this review about 15 minites after leaving this place after my one and certainly final visit to this place, in the midst of some serious gastrointestinal upheaval, not a surprise by any means.... IF you choose to eat here, good luck."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a birthday dinner, so we had a group of about 11. Given the name, there was a certain level of expectation for the duck. We had ordered 2 and what came looked closer to 1. For each one, it came with a little tower which had all of the toppings and heated wrappers. There was a small plate of skins to accompany and the other plate was the duck meat.    Never mind the lack of meaty morsels on tap here, 2 things stood out. Grapes (why?)...and NO lettuce wrappers! The slices of meat were just too small and thin. There was still some flavour here but just not what I was hoping for.   We also ordered a number of side dishes: meatballs, spicy tofu, fried rice, dumplings, ribs, soup and frog legs. These were alright, the tofu and ribs being the standouts for me. The dumplings however didn't cut it.  When it was all said and done, we split at about $28 per person. Fairly reasonable, however we were left wanting more. More duck!  The waiter was nice enough and no real negatives in terms of service however I don't think I'll be returning for the food."}
{"text":"For the price they charge, the service not up to that standard. You practically have to eat (hurry) and leave, the bill was on our table without we asking (how thoughtful lol). We will point to our table and sat ourselves down. And bonus for a \"setting up table in front of us\" show. Well we also have to ask for our menu (I guess, they are expecting you not to go thru the menu) I would suggest not to try their Peking Duck for that price, a lot of places can deliver the same quality with half the price."}
{"text":"Very authentic Beijing cuisine. Very close to what you will taste at the Dayali restaurants in Beijing."}
{"text":"Really really bad service, will never go back again.  ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????cashier  ???????????????? ??????server ????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????"}
{"text":"We came on a Tuesday night and was glad we made a reservation. We were immediately seated but we had to flag a server for the menu. We ordered the Peking duck, sit fried cabbage, spicy clams and hot and sour soup. All these dishes seemed ok. My in laws particularly liked the clans as it had a kick to it. My husband liked the cabbage. It had a lot of flavour being fired with garlic and bacon. The duck which should have been the highlight was ok. I felt like it got too hyped up that we expected something more. Overall, I might be back but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Long waits... Enough said. Good duck meat though and fast food coming to the table. However they missed one of our dishes. Would i come back? If i had 45 mins to wait in line for a table. Also very inefficient wait setup. No numbers with tickets given out so really you could jump ahead of someone."}
{"text":"peking duck (special version) is really good. spicy frog, beef, and those typical sichuan style dishes used to be excellent when it just opened. now it's just ok. i'd still come back for the duck"}
{"text":"Service, so bad. The stupid waitress prefer to leave the table reserved and unseated but not to share with others in the waiting line. Will not come back"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to this place. Went there with my family on New Year's Eve. We were lucky enough to get a reservation for the night. They serve the best Peking duck in the GTA no doubt about it. They are also doing this buy one get one free coupon if you share their WeChat messages on wechat. And two Peking ducks for $30 is a really good deal in my opinion Other items on the menu were just ok. Nothing else stood out or tasted really authentic. Nothing was too horrible either.   The service on the other hand could use some improvement for sure. We waited 20 minutes before our drinks were served.  I'll have to be back to use the two coupons of free ducks!"}
{"text":"Do not like it. We definitely would not go back.  We ordered no. 2031 on the menu: stone pot duck with rice noodles.  Not even a piece of duck.  100% duck bone and duck fat.  For the price of $10.99, it is robbery.  Complained to the waiter at the end of the meal.  We got a $2.00 deduction from our bill. I do give them credit for this gesture.  The dessert No. 5001 Gold dayali pear was just sticky rice flour made into a pear shape with a little bit of sweet red bean in it.  Inside was mostly empty. It looked different and impressive but definitely not worth $2.00 each.  We also had the half price special Peking style steamed tofu for $3.49.  This was the best of the the three we ordered.  No complaint about the service and the room was a bit crowded but still pleasant.  We would not recommend this restaurant and will not return."}
{"text":"Great interior , beautiful presentation and awesome tasting food .. Too many choices , Peking duck , skin needs to be crispier but still one of the best around markham .. Get extra onion and cucumbers .. Some dumpling were good too .. A lotus root dish with meat was super tasty and crunchy .. Wait staff as expected .. Would def go back again .."}
{"text":"The food is alright. It's not bad.   But I have to complain about the service. IT IS BAD!   First we had a reservation table and they did NOT reserve a table for us.   Second, we ordered the peking duck and they only gave us one plate of the skin and the veggies. That is not enough for 6 people. We asked numerous times for additional plates, and the servers served us with frown faces and seemed like they were not willing to give us.   NO ONE gave us a smile and every server FROWNS while serving.   At the end, we STILL gave 15% tips after tax (which is clearly enough), then this female server still got the GUTS to ask for more tips and claimed we did not give them enough tips..  WTFF??? seriously, need to improve the service!!!"}
{"text":"Came here based on a recommendation, and frankly the duck was great, and tasted as close to what I could get in Beijing. Aside from that, the service was slow and the execution of the dishes were sloppy. We had the dessert pear come second, and the dumplings came after we asked for the bill, and the dumplings were dry. Our bill came to just under $80 including tip, and I could honestly say it was totally not worth it. The $20 VIP membership gives $1 off most dishes (over 2 years), which means you need to save $10 a year which means I would need to go at least twice a year. Based on the quality of the food and the mediocre service, I would not go back and advise people not to get attracted to the membership. Unless the service and quality of the food improves, I would recommend that you spend the $80 somewhere else."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Probably using microwave. It was very weird all the dishes is at the room temperature."}
{"text":"A little far from downtown, but worth the time. The package is a good value, and the dishes are really delicious. My friends from Beijing said this restaurant is much better than its chain stores in Beijing. Highly recommend the flavored eggplant and the  sesame sauce in the \"lapi\" is quite original."}
{"text":"Northern Chinese Food @ Warden/North of Steeles... north of the TNT plaza.  Came here for the Peking Duck and it was good!  They first serve the \"most crispy\" part of the skin, and then later with the rest of the skin, and the meat can be made into a soup.  Different from the usual peking duck, how it is also served with sugar and some crispy noddles.  There is also some grapes on the side (wonder if it's always like that the authentic way?)  Anyways, it was really pretty good.  The other dishes are 3-4 star.    Yes, there is a $20 VIP card that you may purchase in order to received discounted price for their dishes.  Definitely worth it if you like the food and think that you will come back.  Busy place, a good half hour wait even on a weekday (evening).  Apparently they let you call in to RSVP.  Good idea if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Just a note, that yes, the wait is THAT bad. They don't take res for less than 5 people. It's not a big restaurant and it's just crazy busy ... we went at 5:30 and there was already a small wait, that got worse and worse. The duck is ok. The duck skin is great... the oil, the fat, all good. Their flour wraps are too dry though.   The rest of the menu is very good (as in the giant variety of dishes they offer)  This place is worth a visit with a reservation but the duck is not AMAZING or life changing"}
{"text":"A more upbeat and contemporary northern Chinese restaurant. The foods are not always consistent, one time they may nail but the others may be a total miss. The price is on the expensive side for this type of restaurant but the place is well decorated."}
{"text":"This restaurant combines delicacies from different provinces in China.  If you want comfortable seating, good service, nice decoration and different than traditional Cantonese, Shanghainese or Peking food, then you should come to this one.  But be prepared to line up and wait unless you come very early or late or have a reservation.  We order 3 different styles - that consists of 3 different bowls of meats in different spices.  Something special but not too enchanting for me.  The bean curd is very smooth and tasty.  The sweet lotus root with chestnut is cut into thin slices, very tender and the sweetness goes inside the lotus root.  One of the best one tastes so far.  The dessert is the Golden Pear.  I guess the name Dayali in Chinese means Big Pear.  You can't image how a Pear becomes such a delicious dessert.  We also come on a weekend lunch Dim Sum.  The Ginger Vinegar Pork Knuckle is very good.  The service comes with it is good too as every time we finish one knuckle, our plate is replaced.  You can see our plate is always clean and tidy!  The most famous dessert is the fruit pancake - surprise to find it in a Chinese Dim Sum restaurant.  The restaurant membership is for 3 year.   It is rare as almost all restaurants the membership is just for 1 year."}
{"text":"I went to Dayali on a weekday night at 7:30pm. We made reservations for 6 people ahead of time, so our wait wasn't too bad. Before sitting down, we were already settled on getting the VIP pass since it knocks down the price for each dish by about a dollar. Come here more than twice and the $20 fee for the card would be all worth it.   Shortly after being seated, we were asked to be moved to another table since a larger group was waiting. Unfortunately, we were moved to a tiny square table meant for groups of 4, no more. After reasoning with the waitress, they were not able to move us back. This was NOT impressive.   Just when we thought things could not get worse, Mr.Grumpy Waiter comes over to take our order. After ordering, we asked him if we should pay for the VIP card now or later. His response? \"$20\". We repeated our question and got the same response. Third time was definitely a charm, as Mr.Grumpy Waiter angrily commented: \"I already told you twice. $20. *opens palms for money*\". We were fuming at this point. He took our money but we did make sure to ask to his supervisor for our money back and to do something about his horrible attitude.  Back to their dishes, we decided to continue to order their famous Peking Duck wrap, a couple of the half price dishes, the Aspic meat jelly cubes and baked pumpkin fries. The Peking duck stole the spotlight - the skin was crispy and duck oil oozes out once you bite into it. The meat was soft, and you get like 8 plate-ful of choices for sauce/sides. Everything else was good, a little on the spicy side but I didn't mind.  We also order the Golden Pear for dessert. There's no pear in the dish, just that the crispy shell and carrot stick is shaped like a pear! It's filled with red bean and was certainly an interesting dish. Suggestion: share one with a friend, you'll probably be full before ordering this anyways.  My rating for their food is probably a 3-4 star, but their service is completely outrageous. No matter how good the food is, I don't think I will be back to take this BS from them ever again."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite place to go to for Peking Duck, usually on weekdays there's never a full house so you get seated right away. The service is abysmal and waiters are usually standing around talking amongst themselves: unfortunately quality of food has become lower than what it used to be; DON'T order the eggplant dish! There's literally nothing but eggplant and TNT store bought sauce. A little disappointed but Peking Duck is still pretty good."}
{"text":"The famous ??? from China with the famous Peking duck. We've been told that this place is always packed so we went there early, around 5:30pm and the restaurant was already filled with people eating. We got like the last table and people that came after had to wait for a table. Their menu had member's price and non-members price, really, be a member to eat Peking duck? They serve 2 styles of Peking duck - the traditional ($32) and the signature ($39) which comes with all these fancy side dishes ... not worth the extra $7 so we got the traditional. The duck itself .. it was serve on the duck plate which was pretty cute. They don't cut the duck in front of you so you have no idea if they rip you off, is it the whole duck?? I doubt it. We also don't see the duck carcass like the usual places where they serve it as soup but you have to pay extra $3 for a bowl (not a big pot either). Th wraps came on a plate, not even in a steam pan to keep it warm. You need to pay extra to have it in steamer. The duck itself, nothing special, mediocre compared to other Peking ducks in GTA. The skin was not super crispy.  Next was the mashed Chinese yam (??) dressed with blueberry sauce - this was a very interesting dish. It's not mashed potato but mashed ?? and then it is piped into shape of a sundae. It is then top with blueberry sauce. It is very refreshing as it was served cold, great for summer time. Another plate, steamed glutinous stuffed lotus root - the presentation was very ugly, sauce spilling all over the plate. The slices were unevenly cut and very little glutinous rice in it, lots of empty holes in the lotus root.  We had the stir-fry rice, it was ok, very oily though. And finally, we got fried taro sticks. At first, we thought this was a dessert dish but it wasn't sweet. Overall, the service was so-so, very rush to get you out of the table. We didn't wait in line but if I had to, no way I would have as it is not worth it. The famous Peking duck was mediocre, expensive compared to other Chinese restaurants, again, I would go to another place. Don't know why there is such a long line-up all the time."}
{"text":"One of my favourite games to play here is \"Count how many Canada Goose jackets are in the restaurant.\" Because, almost every other person and their mom is wearing one in this restaurant. Kind of ironic considering we're all here to eat the peking duck, but I digress...  I've been here three times with different groups of friends and family members, and have deduced one thing. Come here for two things, and two things only: the peking duck and the sweet potato fries. They are delicious, made to perfection, and worth the visit, while everything else will leave you unsatisfied or completely underwhelmed (and you can get it at other restaurants for much cheaper.)  The service at Da Ya Li is probably the most disappointing thing about it. Servers speak little to no English, which would be fine, but are almost never there when you need them, and the food takes forever to arrive. Several times, we had to ask for extra eating utensils (because our table of 9 only had 5 plates,) refills of water, or something else that really should have been taken care of. For a place with astronomical prices compared to other Chinese restaurants that serve similar fair, you should have the customer service to back that sh*t up.  On a bright note, the peking duck is fantastic and filling and the atmosphere is lovely. My family bought the VIP card and it just wasn't worth it for us, but do consider getting it if you're going to be coming back often."}
{"text":"Loved it so much the first time that I couldn't wait to go back.  The wait was a little long.  The VIP card is worth the $20.  But the second time around some dishes were a little disappointing.  The duck was delicious, but some of the other dishes were overpowered by spice.  Although still good."}
{"text":"Total sketchy practice.  While the food is good I will only give them one star with their sketchy practice!  Basically we had a free coupon for a free roast duck, when the bill came down, everything seemed fine, the receipt said free roast duck as an item and what we didn't realize was that the item said free but there was a price of $42.99.    We manually added the all the items and found out $42.99 was added to the bill total even though it's supposed to be free.  When we complained to the server, she was not nice at all, she basically said when you pay with your card at the counter, they will adjust it for you.  We asked what if people just pay cash or they do not pay attention to this, you're scamming people like this.  She didn't say anything and took the receipt away and when she came back, she crossed out the $42.99 but added a mandatory 13% tips.    How many people actually thought they had a free roast duck but ended up paying for it and not realized?  I was shocked but my friend was not because he had seen many bad discussions of their practices on a local Chinese forum.  My friend actually held a birthday party here where he had put down deposit for reservation but it never showed up on the bill for the deposit she had already paid.  DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!!!  Very sketchy business practice."}
{"text":"I'm from Beijing. But I didn't go to dayali in Beijing a lot. It is a cheap and home style restaurant there. This one has ok tasted roast duck. But I have to be picky since I ate many better ones. But definitely good for in Toronto.  Other dishes are decent."}
{"text":"Come here for the peking duck.  You will be wowed by both presentation and taste.  Most menu offerings are reasonably priced if you apply for their VIP discount card and taking into account the cleanliness of the place (it looks very clean) and the more upper scale decorations than many other Chinese restaurants, it's worth a return visit.    We usually order staples such as the peking duck, as well as the salad and the tofu dish (large blocks of tofu cooked in some sort of delicious brown sauce).  The other dishes such as the sweet/sour fried pork cutlets and eggplant dish are good as well.   There will be a line up when you arrive for dinner, so if you have a party of 5+ people, I recommend you calling ahead to reserve a table.  Another plus for this place, is that their peking duck is usually in stock, unlike other Chinese restaurants I have been to where you have to call earlier during the day to 'reserve' a duck in case they sell out."}
{"text":"I can see why this place got such terrible reviews- because the wait is horrendous and the service isn't great.  I came during holiday season on the 27th and had to wait about and hour and 15 minutes for a table for 3.  The wait was long, but they had melon candy at the front and in SF it's not uncommon to wait that long so we sucked it up.  I actually liked that they took your order right as your table was being set up. That saved a bunch of time and the food came out quicker.  We got the duck, ma po tofu, lotus stuffed with sticky rice, pork dumplings, and some meat dish with bean curd wraps.  I was pretty impressed with the duck as well as the ma po tofu, which was the best I've ever had.  My sister, having gone back to China a couple of month ago, said that the food was more like Beijing food than the other places we go.  I think that the food is really quite good here, but yes, the wait is horrible and I probably wouldn't come again unless I could make a reservations (5 ppl minimum)."}
{"text":"Good beijing duck compared to other restaurants in the city"}
{"text":"it has one of the best and authentic peking duck in toronto, and all dishes here are very authentic and good. the VIP card is worth it, it gives you a few bucks off each dishes and is good for the entire year. a few downsides: 1. only cash and debit cards accepted. 2. the service quality is not good at all. it is sometimes non-existent. you would need to grab napkins/chopsticks from nearby tables, and sometimes even if you get the waitress' attention, they might not bring you what you have asked for"}
{"text":"One of the worse restaurant that I had ever been in. I went there to try their signature bejing duck dish and ordered the more expensive one and what we got was a small plate fill with a small portion of ducks...which isn't even the whole duck like what it said. Not only that the service was the worse..took as 15 mins untill one of the waiter came and took our order and it wasn't even busy. And they can't even do a simple job of getting a can of coke..we had to ask three waiter to get one can of coke! And in the end I pay more than $50 and gave them a very little amount of tip for their bad service and they wouldn't let us leave without paying more tip!!!! I will never go back to this restaurant. I would rather starved to death than going back. So save yourself the time and money and don't go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Yup service sucks. Hour wait to get seated. Had to get up and get your own menu, just like another table did. Took another 10 mins to flag someone down to order. Staff are just unaware.   Food is ok. Will have to come back for the duck. Interesting concept with the membership."}
{"text":"Our first meal was on a monday night, without a reservation we just managed to snag a table for 4 at 6pm.  It was packed shortly after with awaiting patrons spilling out to the streets.  Since we were coming back the following Saturday for their duck, we decided to try some other dishes instead.  We ordered the following dishes on the first night:  Salty liver slices in dipping sauce - completely flavourless, like liver boiled in hot water and sliced up.  Also didn't look anything like the menu photo.  Aspic meat jelly cubes - room temp and dry (should be slightly cold, wet and a touch slimy), same dipping sauce as the liver.  Very odd dish, would avoid.  Sweet n sour pork - more for the kids, but way too much batter, complete fail  Silky Tofu in brown sauce - hearty homey feel to this dish.  Trio of veggies/mushrooms in hot oil and soy.  One of the better dishes.  Kidney in hot oil and soy.  Temperature wasn't quite piping hot enough, but at least the kidneys seemed fresh and the flavour was good.  A bit of pepper buzz as well.  Shredded carrots, garlic, sprouts, bamboo and fungus - standard dish  Clear noodle in brown soup - boring carbs filler  Rolled pancake with meat - one of the better ones in town, but there's many places that do this well too.  Green onion cakes - mediocre  Duck in spicy soup and noodles - the soup and spices just overwhelmed it, couldn't taste the duck flavour at all  Over all the night was borderline fail in terms of the food.  We did buy the $20 VIP card, which entitled us to $1-2 off almost all the dishes.  If you go 2 times, you pretty much get your $20 back and them some.  Service was efficient, better than some Cantonese places I've been to in GTA.  Final bill was only $66.89, quite reasonable for the amount of food ordered.  Upon our return on this past Saturday night, our reservation was for 5:15pm (yes, that early!) and we still had to wait 15 mins for our table, as they still haven't got their booking times quite right yet.  This time we ordered the following (prices are after the VIP discount):  Gold Medal Peking Duck $36.88 - actually quite nice.  You start with the thin duck skin only, to be dipped in sugar and eaten as is.  You can really taste more of the roast flavour this way.  Second was the duck thinly sliced with the meat.  Again, with the delicate wrappers and thick/rich sweet sauce, it's one of the better Peking duck places in GTA.  Not quite as good as the ones I had in Beijing this past June, but better than most of the other Cantonese places in GTA (Peaktop, Brilliant, Chung King, Maple Yip, etc).  Extra skins are $3.99, a bit pricey.  Deep fried duck bones $2.88, you can choose 1 of 3 ways it is cooked, we chose the spicy style and again it was nice and crispy.  Peanuts and Spinach $4 - standard dish.  Skewered Bullfrog fried legs $10.50 - we choose the spicy cumin style, nicely done and well spiced.  Lots of meat on the legs.  Didn't taste like chicken!  Tofu with crab brain soup $8 - I wasn't crazy about this, as there was this gritty texture to it.  My Beijing friends enjoyed it.  Baked Pumpkin fries coated with egg yolk batter $8  I've had a lot of egg yolk coated deep fried foods in the past, and didn't find this one was crispy enough nor had enough egg yolk flavour.  Lion's head meatballs in rich broth $4.00, one of the better dishes of the night, the soup was quite nice and meatballs were tender, flavourful and huge.  Quite consistent with the Beijing chain's version, according to my BJ friends.  Fish slices with spicy & sour veggie soup $13 - pretty good soup as well, fresh fish slices, good balance with the sour and salty level.  Lotus roots slices in spicy hot pot $7 - again ingredients were fresh, lotus roots cooked just right and crispy, and spicy level was about right  Diced spicy eggplant $7 - another good dish if you like this style of eggplant  Pork Belly with sticky rice and steamed buns $11 - amazing signature dish, again well replicated from the BJ chain, lusciously rich pork belly covering the sticky rice on the bottom.  One of my favourite dishes, and the kids loved it too.  Spicy Black fungus $5 - standard dish  Gold Dayali x2  $3 - looks pretty, filled with diced duck meat inside a slightly salty and sweet crispy shell (like a dim sum dish)  Pot stickers $6 - standard dish  Peking style spicy lamb $11 - another tasty dish if you love lamb, can get a bit oily though when you hit the bottom pieces.  We also ordered a bitter melon dish, but it was way too salty and we returned it, and they didn't charge us for it.  Final bill was $141.47.  This second meal was much better than the monday night meal.  It was almost like it was a different chef.  They still do not have a liquor license as of this past weekend.  They do take Visa."}
{"text":"Dayali offers excellent Chinese food with big portions at a decent price. The Peking duck here is pretty good. The skin is nice and crispy, the meat is nice and tender. I would say their Peking duck is one of the best in the GTA at a reasonable price.  Aside from Peking duck, their dishes are pretty good too! My favourites are the noodle salad and handmade glass noodles. The noodle salad is a thick wide clear noodle with lots of veggies and pork. The handmade glass noodles are glass noodles in a duck broth. I recommend letting the glass noodles sink in the broth for a while before serving as the noodles are pretty hard when they first serve it.   They also have a VIP program where the offer a few dollars off each dish. The card is $20 and is valid for 2 years so it's a pretty good deal if you visit a handful of times each year."}
{"text":"The signature peking duck was a huge ripoff! For $32, all we got was a small plate of duck meat, some cucumbers, scallion, and peking duck sauce that was not authentic Peking duck sauce. For about half the price, I can go to a regular HK style restaurant and get their sliced duck which tastes better. The other items on their menu are somewhat fairly priced. Service is horrible compred to ther similar chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"At first, I felt disoriented by this place. After all, I'm an elderly Anglo from the Beaches, so coming into a place that's in a sea of parking places and right beside a Keg isn't something I'm used to. Whatever happened to streets up here? The lineup was long and the restaurant had no places I might consider quiet, private or intimate  as a place to talk with friends. The service was totally impersonal; indeed, we ordered our meal through an internet service so it was ready shortly after we were seated. But our two friends recently arrived from Beijing helped us make some excellent selections and we got into the swing of things in no time. If you want genuine Chinese food oriented to people from the Beijing area -- not the Hong Kong style dominant in Toronto's downtown -- this is it. The place is owned by a Chinese chain.  We started with long yam and blueberry; fantastic! And then black mushrooms, again cold, and again fantastic. And then came the Peking Duck. It's my first and I thought it was delicious too. As a side dish, we had lotus root and yam, which was the only item that could be described as spicy, perfect for me, mild for my friends, and a bit too much for my wife. They brought us bottomless jasmine tea, but didn't offer any booze, which I think is terrific-- why should it be pushed, when alcohol isn't good for anyone. In my e-book, Food for City Building, I argue that food is a major vehicle for multiculturalism or interculturalism -- where cultures learn from each other. Unfortunately, for not fault on its part, that is not the case with Dyali. Packed as it was, my wife and I were the only Anglo's. This food and this food experience, need to be experienced by everyone. So get adventurous and learn about your Greater Toronto Area neighbours."}
{"text":"I visited with my family for an authentic Peking duck. I suppose the experience was too authentic because we had trouble communicating with the servers as they mostly spoke Chinese. We ordered the Peking duck, fried rice, fried yam, and some soup. The Peking duck tasted great. I just wish there was more of it. I think we ordered medium or regular size and it was not enough for a group of 3. Everything else tasted just okay. I would attribute our experience to the fact that we could not decipher the menu well enough and the servers were not very helpful. I visited this place because of all the recommendations from Chinese friends. If I make a second visit, I will bring at least one person who can speak Chinese."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. We had a reservation and still had to wait 25 mins  No one brought us a menu or utensils for 10 mins. We had to get up and get it ourselves, even a pen to check off the menu. We asked for another bowl and it took 5 mins.   Service was the worst ever! Ignored us even when we made eye contact and waved at them. Even if their good was gold, I wouldn't come back.   Now for the food....  Fried rice was plain, tastes like it was fried with just soy sauce. My friends can make better...  The duck seemed anorexic.... Wasn't much meat of it, poor guy.  Honestly nothing impressed me where I wanted to eat more. Usually at Chinese restaurants I like most of the dishes, but nothing here...   We only went for the hype, but now we know..... Never again. Ever."}
{"text":"Overrated by many!!!!  My family and I (4 of us) arrived at this restaurant at 8:00pm and saw a massive lineup and waited for 45 minutes for a seat thinking this place must be at least half decent but we were in for a rough ride instead!!!  We ordered the Peking duck, duck bone soup, 4 \"Bo\", deep fried toro roll and hot plate lamb.  First the service, waited for 10 minutes before someone brought us tea and our tableware, waiter/waitress ONLY speaks mandarin.  After placing our order, they gave us desserts first then our other items and Peking duck came last (waited for an hour for the duck), the entire dining experience was off beat since they gave us our food in whatever order they feel.  Tea refill was also am issue, may times their wait-staff simply walk right past our tea pot and ignore the refill signal (cap off).  Service mark:  1/5  Food quality was BAD.  Most items are simply covered in massive amount of oil, food was made with massive amount of MSG (we ended up drinking 5 kettles of tea), their so call \"Peking Duck\" was very disappointing, first we waited for an hour for this duck to arrive at our table, then they gave us these very ordinary BbQ duck pieces which was OK quality at best and their Peking duck wrap was simply supermarket grade stuff.  The duck came cold and with massive amount of oil on the plate which leads me to the conclusion of them simply adding an already BBQed duck from another place and just add oil and dump it into an oven to make it seem like Peking duck.  Food quality:  1/5  Renovation was nice and comforting.  The place has high ceiling, open concept western design with a touch of Asian decoration.  Seats were comfortable and tables were nicely planned out.  4/5  Pricing was another issue.  They want customer to sign up to their so call membership for an extra $20.00 so you can save an extra $2.00 per dish.  Everything were pretty much in the mid price range but quality of food were in the lower price range spectrum.  Our final bill was $100.00(tax and tips in) for the 4 of us and we all agreed that we would have rather paid $100.00 to eat 4 bowls of well made Pho then this place which saids it all. Pricing 1/5  If you are the type that would like to go to a nice place to eat something different then this place is for you, but if you are the type looking for good food, forget about this place and look elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you like pekin duck, the VIP card is worth it. It is 20$ for 2 years but we got our money worth after 3 visits. Now, this is indeed a chain from Beijing and I was surprised to see thibgs like lotus roots filled with glutinous rice on the menu, but keep your expectation in taste low. No, it is not gonna blow you away. Still, one of the best pekin duck you could get in this town."}
{"text":"Mind that if you decide not to pay tips, the guy behind the counter will first tell you in three different ways that you really, really should; and when you say you are not comfortable being asked like that he will demand you to give a reason - why on earth did you choose to commit such a felony - almost like an interrogation. Then you can imagine the face and taunt you get walking away feeling affirmed of your original decision.   Adding to that, the waitress will also come to you to make sure you know they work on low wages and how hard was her day. As if we're responsible for their \"misery\".  I have no words except \"Wow\". I was seriously thinking of going back again. Good to know now I can save the money for something that doesn't make me feel disgusted afterwards.  As to the dinner itself: The food was ok. Quantity is good; quality-wise just alright: many dishes tend to be too salty. Seating was very cramped. The tablewares were not exactly the cleanest - understandable in this busy season. Very basic serving involved. We were 4 adults 2 babies, spent $155. No one ever asked us how's the food.  We tried to be cheering, not to leave bad words in the Chinese New Year - sort of a tradition. But this is just unbelievable."}
{"text":"My Friends and I like coming here for the peking duck and with a group of 6 we can order two orders. There is a pricier one and a cheaper one, we do one of each, mostly because the pricier one is more photogenic. It has more of the side dishes but really isn't necessary because we all just like the basic style of eating our peking duck. Wraps, Duck, hoisin sauce and onions, done! The rest of the duck we do the soup option, this soup is super flavourful.   The signature sliced boiled fish in chili oil is also quite good if you like the Sichuan pepper that is really numbing. The sprouts soak up all the flavour, but I find the fish won't be too spicy. It looks more frightening than it is for people who don't eat too spicy, just try it!   They have a rice in the rice cooker, and you pour sauce in and it is definitely a crowd favourite. It is also very filling in case you have friends who have bottomless pits for stomachs.   They also have a member system, you pay for the membership and they price items with the normal price and member pricing right on the menu. It is worth it if you plan to come often and with groups.   Service is usually pretty good. It can get hectic here so make reservations."}
{"text":"Everything else is mediocre, EXCEPT the duck heads.  They are fantastic, and I just can't get enough of them.  The service is alright, and their other dishes are too mediocre in my opinion. Remember to make a reservation before you go there, as the place gets very crowded and the waiting time is very long."}
{"text":"Correct me if I am wrong. Isn't this place famous for their Peking duck? I can get better duck in any BBQ stores in GTA. Other foods was just okay.  Came in on a Thursday night around 8:30 and this place was still very packed so I did not expect too much from service but the hostess and server/ food runner did a pretty good job. I saw lots of exciting things I would like to try on the menu but I don't think I wanna go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Worst customer service!!!! Called early in the afternoon to make a reservation. The lady on the phone said they don't take reservations and said they would have tables available at 7:30pm first come first serve. Got there at 6pm. Front hostess said we needed a reservation and only take reservations for party of 7 or more. Why do they not  clearly state their reservation policy? I saw more than half of the tables were free and asked to be seated. They said we had to wait. Waited 45 mins and still no table. Would not go back ever again until they clearly train their staff."}
{"text":"Okay I so needed to write an update on this place. I want to know how to open a second Dayali chain because man...this place must be racking in the money like no tomorrow. I have been here many times since and I am not sure why. Well, first of all, it's a new restaurant (and new way of eating Peking Duck) that has brought us to take our out of town relatives for a new experience. And, we always get the private room (there are two), which you must order a minimum of $300 for the small room or $350 for the larger room. The private room is why we can tolerate this place because outside is absolute chaos, mayhem, and HELL!  Last night, we had the door closed to our private room and there were so many people outside waiting that we could see them pushed up against our glass door, as if they were splattered on. I was first to arrive to the restaurant and I couldn't even get in. And when I got in, it was impossible to get someone to look at me, and when I waved to the tall man (I think he is part owner) he looked at me, continued to talk to another woman while looking at me, and then looked away. I really have to learn that skill as while it was really rude, more so, it was really creepy. If I can creep the heck out of someone with just one look, let me have it please.  The waiters are just worked to the dickens I suppose. Service is not bad in that they are rude (although their looks and comments to you could be defined as rude) but it's just that you have to ask for things over and over and over again. And when you ask, they give you a 'ugh' look. There are just too many people for them to care.  Our bill came out to $400 and change which included a big lobster, steamed shrimp with garlic, various egg dishes, various fried pancake dishes, three large bowls of soup, fish, and three orders of Dayali's famous Peking Duck (done in three ways). Nothing goes to waste so we also got Duck Soup, and Fried left over duck pieces done in two ways (Peppery and Plain). Really, the food is cheap because can you imagine ordering all this at a Lai Wah Heen for $400? Nope...more like $1500-$2000. Furthermore, we got the VIP pricing which makes the food even cheaper.  So, why do people come to this place when the service sucks, the food is average (in my mind), the atmosphere is so bad (busy, cramped, people smoking and horking right outside the restaurant) and it's their way or the high way? You can't make reservations if you don't have more than 5. One time, there was a group of 6 where two people did not show up. The owner came up to them and said you can't have this table. Go back in line. And they did. And they waited patiently for two hours.  My family has been there for 5 times now and still it's not like managers greet us and welcome us back. The attitude is distinctly we don't care if you never come back. We have so many other people willing to take your spot. And if you are coming back, then see? We are doing something right. So I guess it boils down to money and how cheap the food is.  And this brings me back to my initial question...how do I capitalize on this brand name? How do I make loads of money off people who are willing to make reservations but still have to wait for 3 hours and if they don't have the right amount of people, still stay and wait for 3 hours more?!?!"}
{"text":"Peking duck isn't something i have regularly all the time, so I've only been to Dayali a few times for special occasions.  Location is fairly spacious with almost all-white decor, though despite all their space I felt the tables were too close together.    I ordered from a set menu that included peking duck.  The portions were smaller than I'd expect as if they are trying to go a more gourmet route.  The meat and sauces were great, it's just unsatisfying to go have chinese food for dinner and for the portions to be small.  Other than that, none of the other dishes are too noteable.    Service was unimpressive.  This is not a language barrier, because even if you spoke chinese to the servers, they will barely pay attention to you.  This isn't uncommon for chinese restaurants, you just expect a bit more because of the fancier decor."}
{"text":"A standard set of Beijing duck is more than 30 dollars with only 10 slim pieces of green onion and cucumbers. Very expensive."}
{"text":"This restaurant tried really hard to be high end northern chinese cooking. We tried several dishes, but most were average at best for a higher price point. You mainly pay for the fancy decor.... and the NSYNC music in the background. We tried several dishes, and ma-la numbing spice poached fish was very well done. I normally dont eat numbing spice, but it wasnt too spicy and the fish was perfectly cooked with lots of flavor. Peking duck was average. The crab/egg yolk soup was almost inedible, because it was too rich in egg yolk and one spoonful was much too rich. The food also comes out at all different times, making it hard to have a complete meal.  Although in Markham, staff is mostly Mandarin speaking (not canto) and does not understand any english.  Oddly enough, they dont take credit card for a \"higher end\" restaurant. They have a weird membership they try to sell to you (NOT free) so that you get slight discount on their menu prices. Overall, a 2.5/5"}
{"text":"It was so much fun to put in percent tip 0 We never do this. Two of us from our group of five are bar/restaurant staff. We NEVER leave no tip. This place was such a comedy of errors. Everything was wrong. We ordered a milkshake. Took about an hour of follow up before we were told they did not actually make milkshakes.  We ordered soup. We're outside the restaurant now. We've left. The soup never came.  The server didn't know if the soup was coming. To quote: \"I don't know.\" Everything took forever. Didn't even have the yelp app on my phone anymore but installed it again just to leave this. What a disaster."}
{"text":"The Peking duck portion was tiny (for $32) and very mediocre. It wasn't properly crispy like peking duck should be,  The waiter was rude and very slow. We were left alone the whole time, even after we finished eating. We waived around in vain. When someone FINALLy showed up at our table, we ordered the fried pear dessert (I thought it'd be quick) and asked for the bill.  We had to wait over 15 minutes for the pear (had we known we wouldn't have ordered it). It was just a pear shaped nian gao (sweet rice dough, like mochi) filled with some red bean paste, then breaded and deep fried. It was unnecessarily oily, and quite bland.  The final bill came to over $45, and that was just for the duck and the single pear. Won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"The price is a little bit expensive , the dish is OK . Service is so so.  But the gold duck is good !"}
{"text":"Came here for family dinner and reserved a room. Although they stipulated a minimum spending of $300, we actually couldn't meet it (and believe me we tried REALLY hard, but the items were just very fairly priced) but I think we only ended up around $250 for about 10 people. Strangely though I actually found the duck the most disappointing. We ordered both the regular version as well as the special version. Portions were small, and flavours were lacking. The rest of the menu though was really enjoyable. Perfectly sized for the family with each dish being really reasonably priced in terms of quality and quantity I think I would prefer going to this place for casual family dinners as opposed to large celebratory ones.   Overall food was great, but for the duck which is the most expensive and also supposed to be among the main things they're good at. I would still definitely return though since like I said their smaller dishes are quite good and flavourful."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch and the heat wasn't even on...everyone (at least 4 other tables) was wearing winter jackets and the servers were unresponsive, scrolling on their cell phones. They turned on the restaurant lights about 10mins after we sat down. What kind of restaurant doesn't turn the lights on after opening? What a joke.  We literally waited 20 minutes for anyone to come take our order and by the time someone responded he'll be with us soon, he was off doing something else again. This place is one of the poorest maintained restaurants I've ever been to. Not to mention the dump of cigarette buds by the front door is embarassing. No care is taken at this place and you don't need to go in to realize. There are plenty of better places around here."}
{"text":"The Peking duck is to die for,  I've never had Peking duck as good as here!  Aside from the duck,  none of the other dishes stood out -  we had dumplings,  green onion pancake,  fried rice,  and spicy shrimp in peanut sauce.   Go there if you want Peking duck,  otherwise look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Really good Peking duck in the city (although they do give less duck than most other places), but it is so popular that wait time can be excruciating. Aside from duck, the other items on their menu are just on par, so not quite worth the wait."}
{"text":"You have to order the right dishes to enjoy the food in this restaurant. Since this is more like a northen chinese cuisine, dont order steamed fish or lobster. I dont think they are good at seafood.   But they are good at cooking meat, expecially duck. Of course, that is the specialty of this restaurant. Try to choose the upgraded one as it tastes better and has more sides."}
{"text":"Some of their dishes were a hit, some were a miss, and most were just laden with oil.  Keep in mind, this is pretty much what you would get in China.    Hits:  The duck skin was good, the pork belly with sticky rice and buns was tasty, and I really enjoyed the frog leg skewers.    Misses:  The pork hock had no flavour.  Sweet potato fries were coated with an egg yolk batter but it was just so greasy and heavy tasting.  The mashed potato with fruit purée made to look like an ice cream sundae?  Blech.    Some other dishes we tried:    fried liver (oily) chicken with green chillies (oily) dessert rolls filled with taro and sesame on the ends (fried, therefore oily) vegetarian dish with lotus root (oily)  Looking at all your food sitting in pools of oil is just so unappealing.    Just be more selective with your order and you will fare better than my first experience."}
{"text":"I've had many Peking duck in the past and I really enjoyed this place. The skin is very crispy and not very fat. I've read many reviews about the service, I can't say that we experienced bad service. Our tea pot was filled in a timely manner. I do think the place is over priced and the bad thing was the lobster. Very dry! We also had the fish cooked in oil and pepper. Whoa! Talk about dumping a jug canola oil in a bowl! The fish was good and not fishy. Overall I'd go back just for the Peking duck. :)"}
{"text":"The peking duck was very good. I think this is as close you are going to get to authentic peking duck in Toronto."}
{"text":"Very fun place, great tea. Duck was alright. Surprise factor 10/10. Very exciting.  Ordered a duck and got 5 pieces of skin. Whole table was frozen. Shocking~~. Luckily the rest of the duck found its way to our table xd"}
{"text":"We decided to celebrate Mother's Day here which was a mistake.  First they didn't want to take reservations for a party of 5. So we went early, around 530 on a Saturday.  We had to wait 25 min. When we were finally seated on a tiny table, we ordered 2 Signature ducks, a few other dishes and availed of the crispy fried duck bones which I clearly said and wrote to be seasoned with only salt and pepper. The order came fast.The duck bones were spicy, clearly not following instructions. I had it returned but the 2nd time it was the same spicy bones with cumin. There wasn't anyone who could understand us. They also did NOT give me 2 coupons for their buy one get one free promo because they said they changed the rules and it is now related to the We Chat app, the mechanics of which I could barely understand. Overall, our experience was not pleasant at all."}
{"text":"Okay food, WORST service EVER!  I've never had the desire to write a food review, but I had to write this to warn people to stay away from this poorly management slave trade. I reserved a table here for my mother's birthday after hearing great things from friends. While the food was mediocre, and the price was average, this was the WORST dining experience I have ever experienced. The service personnel all had huge attitude problems. They will bring over food when the table has no space, and will ask you to carry it with your hands! After speaking with management, it turns out that half the employees are brought directly from China's main office, and speak no english at all. Even when asking something as simple as a napkin in english, they will fail to understand and be offended that you can't speak chinese instead.   I would not recommend this to anyone, especially if it is for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Food was decent but not outstanding. Service was lousy during lunch hours. Food came very slow and our server was rude. We ordered the roasted Peking duck set and we asked them if it comes with a lettuce wrap after we finished the duck. The server sounded almost angry saying we have to tell them we want that when we order the duck set. Most of the food were tasty and well repented except the rice with meat. They simply put their ugly rice cooker on our table and let us scoop in it. With the price we are paying I definitely expect better service than this. I won't come back"}
{"text":"This place was ok...nothing really stood out to me.  The people who work there barely spoke English and it seemed like they didn't want to help when we asked for something.  Our initial server who spoke better English was good, but everyone else...it was like talking to a wall sometimes.  Even while we were still in the middle of eating, the waitress brings us our bill and we weren't even done.  Everything we ordered was basically, \"just ok.\"  The Peking duck...there was nothing special about it and when we asked for more hoisen sauce, they said it cost 2$??  Really?? To just squeeze out something we can get at the grocery store?    Anyway, I could honestly say, the one thing I liked that I ordered was the spicy potato stack thing they had however there was no spice to it.  Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday night at 850pm. Once we decided to order there's no one around to take the order when we finally found someone he told us we have to wait 10 more mins because the chief is eating."}
{"text":"I recommend calling ahead and getting a reservation before heading to this restaurant. This restaurant is smaller than other Chinese places and there is usually a wait.  I also recommend getting the VIP card for $20 for the year because you can save anywhere from $1 to $4 dollars per dish if you have a VIP card.  Our family didn't get the peking duck the last time we went but in my experience the duck is pretty good compared to other places. It isn't amazing but worth a try if you haven't before.  My favourite dishes are the cold noodles - which is the perfect blend between spices, the crunchy cucumber and the peanuts that add to the dish. Other dishes include the frog legs in a spicy Sichuan sauce, the sweet potato fries dipped in egg yolk and  any of their dumplings.  If you are looking for good quality Beijing, Sichuan food, this place is a good place to go. The food can be pricy but also can be cheaper if you know what to order and not indulge in their more expensive dishes."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of authentic Northern Chinese cuisines! The type of food is exactly what you would get in a similar restaurant in China, which is rare considering how many Chinese/Canadian restaurants are in the GTA region. The atmosphere is great, and service is relatively fast and attentive. There is a VIP card option, which costs $20 but will save you $1-3 every dish and will be worth it after approximately 2 visits.  In terms of food, have not had a bad dish here in several visits. Some of the food is a bit on the mild side, but it's never been disappointing. The spicy dishes are super flavour, so if you can take the heat - it's definitely something you shouldn't miss out.  Overall, our absolutely favourite Northern Chinese restaurant in the GTA region."}
{"text":"Eating in there right now. Worst service u can imagine. We have to sit ourselves cuz no one is to greet us.  We have to stand up and goto the front to get the menu and we have to call a few times before getting our tea. And last but not least we dun even have utensils to eat with and we have to yell out cuz no one listens!!!Ppl seem like they got up the wrong side of bed. Never again.  The one star is for the food."}
{"text":"I will say Dayali is a nice place to have some Chinese comfort food, a taste of home, not very fancy or special, but delicious! On their well-designed menu book with many color photographs, there are a number of selections that are able to satisfy everyone's favorite.  My friend told me Wudalang pan-fried Meat pie is very good and I just can't agree more. Sauteed shredded pork in sweet bean paste also tastes great. I really enjoy DIY a tofu skin wrapped pork with thinly shredded cucumber and green onions.  If you like something spicy, Griddled clear noodles and Chinese Cabbage is highly recommended=)  The Signature Roast duck is average and the soup made from the bones is just ok.  I'm not that into the Braised Pork Knuckles. The texture is very soft, which is good. However, it is not well seasoned and tasteless. Stewed Fish Head is also not my type. The flavor is weak.  Overall it is a good dining experience. But I still have to mention that the service in Dayali is below the average(yes, I'm saying the guy working for the reception with a not welcomed face), which seems normal in most of the Chinese restaurant. What a pity."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Wait time for the duck  -5 stars Horrible services -3 star  Cleanliness -1 star  Quantity of the duck -1 star Since cannot put negative 5 stars.. Have to give them 1 star"}
{"text":"Where's the zero star rating? Came here for dinner with family. I order this snow pea veggies  and was surprised there was century egg in there. I check the menu and no where it says there is this egg in there. I couldn't eat this because of my pregnancy so I spoke with the waiter.  He rudely says why I didn't ask if there was century egg in here. WTF??? The description says plain veggies in soup no where it has this ingredient. If I knew why would I order this? He was rude and argument on why I didn't ask and would not cancel the order for us. I had to order another same veggie that says saute which funny didn't have anything. This place is rude and a joke. Nothing special and have no respect for customer. All the other dishes weren't that great. If you don't want any surprises on your food, I would not go there. Like other reviews here, we got stomach ache afterwards.  Poor service, non hygienic place."}
{"text":"the only reason why you would come specifically to this restaurant is for the duck, which is absolutely to die for. These guys made their name specializing in duck in China, and then expanded overseas. the duck is served sliced into extremely thin slices Chinese style, and then it is wrapped at the table in a very thin pita by those who are eating. duck bones can then be made into a soup which is made immediately after slicing. the duck set is small, I would recommend one duck for every three people in addition to other dishes."}
{"text":"Suckity suck suck.   Such a fancy layout yet the food stinks. They try to be all creative but it falls short. Never been so disappointed in a Chinese restaurant. I'd much rather visit first Markham place food court (which is pretty good tbh)   Hot and sour soup: nor hot or sour. Tasted weird as ever.  Blueberry yam : should have known something that looks like a sundae but is actually yam would suck but I'm adventurous. It was very sweet from blueberry jam and then you get weird warm yam flavors. Bizarre.  Soup dumplings : no soup.. dry. Just oil inside.   Jellyfish : it was super hard like eating cartilage. Super intense black vinegar to boot. Best part of the dish was the cucumbers. can't f*k that up right?   Peking duck : the cut of the pieces were all wrong. They try to make it different by giving you sides of fried potato pieces and dried cranberries. Just not good. The wrap were big and dry as well. Sucked.  Dumplings : probably from T&T frozen section. The only part of the meal that tasted like it should. Sucked.   Meat pie: at this point, we didn't even wanna touch it.   I would rate this place negative if I could. I don't know how many times I've said the work \"suck\". And not in a good way ;)  Please avoid for the sake of your stomach people!  #savethestomach"}
{"text":"Went there for some family lunch. Wasn't too busy, and so was surprised at how crappy the service was. Had to order water three times just to get water, and had to ask for hot water for the tea three times just to get the water. When the server did come, it was like she didn't give a crap about us and had some attitude.   The reason why I gave it an extra star is because of the food. The Peking duck is fantastic. it is a must try for everyone and it is their signature dish. I don't know about getting the fancy dish where it comes with cranberries, and what not. I think the ordinary order without the frills is fine.   This place isn't a cheap place. I would say it is about $30 per person depending on what you order, ect. Maybe its just that we are heavy eaters, but this place was pricey.   Overall, would go again for the Peking duck, but thats about it."}
{"text":"The only thing good here is their specialty roast duck. Don't even think about service here. You are lucky if you leave the restaurant feeling you had a normal meal out.  Feel free to ask for my experience. My conclusion is, the duck is not good enough for me to go back there."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about this place, so I was pretty excited to try. Came with a bunch of friends, so I didn't make the reservation. Turns out that there HAS to be minimum of 5-6 tables to make a reservation and if you arrive and don't have 5 people at the table, they deny your reservation on the spot - that was pretty annoying to start with. So we waited for the rest of the party to come and the staff kept coming up to us asking if we were ready - another annoying snippet of the night. Friends came and we ordered.. The food arrived relatively fast and fresh. For me, the dishes weren't anything special. Not like I haven't tried most of the dishes there. This restaurant is just a typical Chinese cuisine with a name slapped on that has good rep for their ducks.  I must admit, they chose a really good location to setup shop. Where all surrounding restaurants are Western, this place stands out and would definitely catch the attention of older Asian individuals being dragged by their next of kin to a \"gwai lo\" restaurant.  Before I forget, their staff were outright rude. We asked for separate bowls for soup and the lady gave us the most atrocious cut eye. Was that really necessary? It wasn't like she was going to wash them anyway..  Horrible reservation tactic in my opinion, pushy and terrible attitude = 2 stars."}
{"text":"I didn't know that DaYaLi was a chain prior to coming.  I just figured that Peking ducks which hail from Beijing (formerly known as Peking) would be good - or maybe not?!  IMHO the Cantonese-style Beijing duck is much better.  We got the Gold Medal Roast Duck ($38.88).  This includes:  Roast Duck Pancakes Condiments (scallions, hickory sticks, salt, cucumber, grapes?! Yeah, they went there, but the grapes were surprisingly good)  The duck was on the leaner side but then I realized that the leaner duck is meant to compensate for an additional plate of duck skin which is 100% pure fat when you bite into it.  (This comes as a separate plate from the rest of the duck).  The duck itself lacked any real flavour and was rather bland.  The pancakes (wrap), especially the very first ones were so dry I thought I was eating raw dough.  No elasticity at all.    You can choose to have the duck carcass made into a soup or deep fried.  We went the deep fried route.  Not much to chew other than skin and bones :p  Other than the signature roast duck we had Fish in Chili Oil which you may not think is spicy, but before you realize it, your tongue starts becoming numb.  The peppercorns that infested this dish were also highly annoying and only added to the numbing of the tongue.  The fish itself was tender, though lacked any real flavour.  But that maybe because my tongue was numb... This is turning into a circular argument now...  The Stir-Fried Pork Intestines were really tender and quite flavourful and beware the peppers, because your tongue was already tortured by the Fish in Chili Oil.  The Ham Hock (cold dish) was quite flavourful but not that interesting to look at in terms of presentation.    The veggie dish we ordered was Stir Fried Lotus Root + Water Chestnuts which I really enjoyed because it was crunchy and flavourful.  We did end up trying the DaYaLi pear which is like a sweet version of a Ham Sui Gok except instead of minced meat it's red bean paste inside.  I wasn't that thrilled by it and they were definitely stingy when it came to the filling.    At 9PM people were still lined up waiting to get a seat.  I wouldn't stand more than 15 minutes in line.  Most of the dishes I had here were flavourless and oily.  Don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Food was weird to me. Mostly strangely sweet idk. Not good to me besides Peking duck.  Service is absolutely horrible. It was getting late and my family asked for someone to take away some of the dishes and they said something about how the servers were done. Everyone was standing around and stuff."}
{"text":"What's funny is that if this restaurant was in Montreal, it would most likely be much better rated (likely 4-5 stars). But since the standards for authenticity are higher in the GTA, Dayali seems to somehow fall short with most people.   The interior is quite nicely decorated, with neutral colors and a lot of light. The menu is quite beautiful and the service is fine. The availability of private rooms on the side is a big plus, as many families prefer to have a more intimate setting for their gatherings. This restaurant is mainly frequented by Asians, and the menu covers a broad selection of dishes from different parts of China. Some are closer hits than others, however. When I went there during the holiday season with my Sichuanese family, we ordered a whole table of food - most dishes were good, but others, like the Kung Pao Chicken, were just off (it was sweet! why would they ever do that?!).   Nevertheless, we had a good time, and probably would go back next year. Unless we find a better place.  Tip: They have membership cards that give you discount!"}
{"text":"Nothing particularly outstanding. It fits in the category of clean and looks good. If you're looking for food that actually has flavour (esp. wok hay) other than spicy, hot or fiery, then you will need to venture elsewhere."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner at 6pm on a Friday night. When we arrived, we were asked whether we had a reservation or not.( we were a party of 9) I said no and the waiter told us that we could have a table, if we vacated it at 7.30pm, for a reservation.  We said fine.They only have 2 - 10 people tables. As soon as we sat down we decided to order quick. The wait staff are pretty friendly( for a chinese restaurant). The waiter brought all the kids a glass of water each, they even re-filled the water without us asking!!   We ordered the duck. It was really juicy and the meat has a fantastic smooth texture.( due to having no salt and seasoning placed onto the duck before cooking). Cantonese roast duck has flavourings placed inside and out, which makes the duck meat texture different. We got the duck bones deep fried - lovely dish Glass Noodles - The kiddies all loved these Special Fried Rice - Was above average Beijing Intestines Dish - This was something we have never eaten before, it was fine Kidney Salad - OK, it had five spice dressing on it Cold Duck Wings - These were ok too Cold Pigs Feet - These were good Chinese Brocolli - Ok  The VIP card costs $20 to buy and is valid for 3 years. This gives you the VIP pricing for all dishes.(minimun $1 off dishes)   Overall, we had a pretty good meal.  Service was quite good.  But there was a big wait for tables, all the way outside! We will definately go back"}
{"text":"Over priced. Decor is extremely misleading. The decor looks high end (by Chinese standards), but the food does not compliment that. Better ducks elsewhere. Significantly better noodles elsewhere. Some of the other dishes were too salty. Oh, did I mention the horrible service? The servers were great at walking around and walking around some more. They weren't happy to be asked to clear empty dishes off the table. Definitely not helpful and less than useful. I'm not returning."}
{"text":"If you want bad food, really bad service then this is the place for you! Wait staff barely spoke English. Food took forever to arrive. Peiking duck was a disappointment and over priced. Soggy meat, skin and meat attached to each other and skin was no crunchy at all. Shrimp fried rice came with one shrimp, and arrived half an hour after we ordered it. Other northern Chinese dishes lacked flavour. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"If you like Peking duck in a grand presentation with a good ambiance,  this is a good place.  Forget about service, this place is packed , you have to wait for seats, wait for tea refills, wait for your bill.  Food  is good with decent prices.  Tips-  -go early to get first dinner seating around 6:30pm   -Parking is a nightmare- go across the street to park on the right side of the restaurant   -Don't forget to try their lamb basil served on a warmer- tasty"}
{"text":"I think you have to be hard core Chinese to like this place. Flavours and the amount of chili did not impress my taste buds at all. PK duck was descent, but not worth coming back for.  I don't recommend if you are a CBC. It's so loud here you can't hear yourself think or have any kind of conversation."}
{"text":"If you're coming solely for the Peking Duck, then there are many more other choices. Northern Chinese food is pretty strong in flavour which is customary and Dayali was no different and they kept to that.  Normally it can also be very very oily, which they slightly modified for Canadian long standing Chinese and those who are being starting to be more health conscious (1st star) 3rd star really belongs to the best dish of the evening. The gwai hua tong yuan ( Osmanthus aka sweet olive glutinous stuffed balls). Most places only give a handful of the Osmanthus flowers, but Dayali gave a wonderfully good portion making the soup dessert wonderfully fragrant and amazingly delicious. (2&3stars!)"}
{"text":"BEWARE OF SCAM. Please do not come here.  Food is mediocre and not worth the high price point. I tried to use a free peking duck coupon and was told I would have to pay tax on the free duck while paying a required 30% gratuity on the entire bill. Does that sound like a \"free peking duck\" to any of you? Sounds more like a scam to force a 30% gratuity on the bill. Please do not visit this place and allow a despicable restaurant stay open."}
{"text":"This review pertains specifically to the 160 York Boulevard location but I just wanted to share about this terrible chain restaurant:  BEWARE OF SCAM. Please do not come here.  Food is mediocre and not worth the high price point. I tried to use a free peking duck coupon and was told I would have to pay tax on the free duck while paying a required 30% gratuity on the entire bill. Does that sound like a \"free peking duck\" to any of you? Sounds more like a scam to force a 30% gratuity on the bill. Please do not visit this place and allow a despicable restaurant stay open."}
{"text":"Never again.  I've been to the Dayali in Beijing and loved everything about it. Hence, when I found out they opened in Richmond Hill I had pretty high hopes for it. However, it turned out to be a case where high expectations were met with greater disappointments.   The food first of all was not even close to the standard of their Beijing counterpart. Portions were a lot smaller, and the saltiness in their side dishes really masked the original flavours of the ingredients. The duck was sub par in terms of their crispiness of the skin.   My biggest complaint however, is their terrible service. We waited a very long time to be seated because no one was at the front to greet us. We specifically told our waitress that my brother had peanut allergies and indicated for certain dishes to be peanut free. The next thing we see is our salad with a pile of roasted peanuts on top as garnish. Certain dishes were also forgotten and we had to remind them multiple times to have our food served. After the unpleasant experience, we just wanted to pay and leave. However, the waiters basically ignored us even after making eye contact. We had to go up to the waiters who were chatting amongst themselves to get our bill.   Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner as this was my first visit, I had no expectations aside from seeing pictures online. The venue is quite clean, but I find it a bit on the cramped side. Maybe that is just me.   Onto the food. As this place is known for their duck, we ordered the Peking Duck. It came out in a fancy dish with a warming element in the centre to keep the wafer thin dough wrapping for the duck moist. Otherwise the dough wrapping will dry up. That's a nice gimmick? But I wasn't convinced with it. The duck tasted just okay, nothing fancy. Plus we ordered a ton of other dishes, and the duck was overshadowed by it.   Maybe I am just a \"meats and potatoes\" kind of guy, so the food at this place is very rich and not for me."}
{"text":"Bottom line: This is a new location of this restaurant and if you like you some bejing eating, this doesn't dissapoint. They could give me more soy milk though =P  What I ate:  I had a bunch of things and I don't remember it all but included were frog legs, beef noodles, dumplings, and others.   What I think: For me, bejing food has strong flavour and delicate dishes. What you should be going there for is there Peking duck. It's one of the things they're known to do well here. However, the beef noodles and dumplings were good too. They weren't the typical kind you find around town. The soup of the noodles carried a distinct beef flavour to it. More times than most, what you find isn't as natural (in taste) as the one you get here. The dumplings themselves were clearly handmade and delicious too. Oh, and the frog legs? Taste like some good tender on the inside, crispy on the outside chicken.   I also ordered some soy milk. It's a tiny glass even for a dollar. I'd probably stick to tea when you go here.   Final thoughts: as far as bejing food goes, come try this restaurant and try their new location too - the line to get in is a lot shorter (for now). If you're unfamiliar with Chinese food in general, this will come as a twist to your favourite and standard dishes."}
{"text":"It's a good place for authentic Peking duck (signature roast duck). However time after time, the amount of meat and skin we get is very inconsistent...sometimes it looks as if they split one duck into two portions.....while we are paying for a whole duck.   The other dishes REALLY need improvement..and we've probably tried everything at least once on the menu.  Service wise has improved a bit - the girls used to be very unprofessional, rude, and didn't keep their eyes out for tables needing their service. Could depend on who is working...but the first two times we went I was shocked at the attitude.   Decor is nice..but ventilation is bad and you end up smelling like oil upon leaving!   Conclusion is...go for the presentation and the duck if you don't mind it being overpriced. Try to stay away from anything else to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"The food at this place is okay, nothing special, but the service is beyond terrible. none of the waiters or waitress respond to your request, and for the most parts ignore the customers. i have no idea why people come here, as the food is not spectacular the price is expensive, and the service is terrible. they do have another chain store, but it is not better then this one. i would not recommend to place to anyone who just wants good northern chinese food, or good chinese food in general. as there are tons of chinese food places in markham/richmond hill. no reason why you have to go to this joint."}
{"text":"Called a day before to confirm the earliest time we could arrive for lunch.  We were told 11 am.  We arrive at 11 am the next day only to be told they open at 11:30 am and they were still cleaning.  I asked if we could wait inside the restaurant until 11:30 but both of the girls working did not understand what we were saying (they didn't speak English or cantonese, or very little).  Finally a third woman told us we could not.    We ended up going next door for dim sum."}
{"text":"I read about this place in the recent Globe article on Toronto's top ten Chinese joints. So I rounded up 3 of my high school buddies and we headed up to Markham to check out the Gold Medal Roast duck. It was a disappointment for 3 reasons:  1) Service, service, service. I know there's an old school charm to Chinese restaurants with poor to middling service. However, I'm at my wits end about accepting that there are cultural reasons for poor service. There are many examples of fine Chinese dining with great service, and Dayali's was disappointing. Maybe they aren't catering to me (I don't speak Mandarin).   2) The Globe reviewer must have skipped the Blueberry Yam. I'm sorry those flavours shouldn't go together, unless it's done by some skilled mind. The rest of the food was middling at best.  3) The decor is nice and clean. And it feels authentic in there, but I felt like the place has no distinct personality. I need something to draw me in, and nice wallpaper isn't going to do it for me.  I wouldn't go back or recommend."}
{"text":"Premium Peiking Duck is ready to serve within 5 mins. It did show the dish is not freshly made by order, cold and pity. Also portion is not as usual as I ate in other restaurants. Quite disappointed."}
{"text":"I remember. My vacation to Beijing. It never happened. However, do I should I take flight across the ocean? When Peking Ducks fly my way. In the G T A.  Gold Medal Roast Duck ($38.88)  Roast Duck Dry Wafer Thin No Oily Skin Until you Bite in.  Containment field, once you breach it, the oil escapes. Natural flavours lack intensive addictive seasoning. Meat of complete bland un-roast-like tenderness. It's a different animal all together(vs cantonese). Go and figure it out yourself.  Golden Pear ($1.50 each)  Not everyday you can eat Golden Pears. I can eat a few of these for app and dessert. Rare chance you'll see me eat Fruits."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend, reservations is required as it is a fairly small restaurant. We wanted to try the premium Peking duck which was basically presented differently (more upscale). They charged extra for the presentation, next time would probably order the original one as the toppings are practically the same. Peking duck was great, would probably only order that and the glass noddles in soup next time. You most likely will have to order more wraps as there isnt enough. We also chose to add soup for a couple bucks which was well worth it.The other dishes we ordered were the spicy chicken(really spicy!) , pork ribs (found a bit dry), fried pork (nothing special). Lastly we tried the cumin flavoured beef - had a bad after taste and half the dish was onion. Overall would come back just for the duck!   Also they have a vip card ($20) depending on the amount of dishes you order might be worth while as the savings could be quite good. Plus you can just it for the next 2 years!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night for a surprise 50th bday dinner in the private room. First impression when I walked -- very  formal and elegant for a Chinese restaurant, wait staff distributed around the restaurant  ready to serve the patrons.   We experienced some difficulty communicating with the hostess (her English wasn't great) when we gave her the name for the reservation. When she finally figured out which reservation we were with she gestured in the direction of one of their party rooms. She didn't escort but shouted to another waiter where we were going as we were walking over. Not the best first impression, service-wise.  The party room was very nicely decorated with crown moulding, upholstered chairs, even fake props on the bookshelf. Each person was served a glass of ice water-- a sign of things to come!  Somebody else from our party ordered so I can't comment on what was on the menu but here's what we ate. The first several courses came all at once: A dressed green salad (not bad, dressing was quite good), mashed yam mounds with blueberry sauce which looked identical to soft serve ice cream with blueberry sauce (okay), lotus root stuffed with glutinous rice (quite good), chicken in brown sauce (very good), tureen of rib soup (great flavour and spice), braised pig knuckle (okay), lobster (standard), spicy shrimp with cashews (really good!).   I liked that things were unexpected but well balanced. The dishes started on a sweet note, gradually moving to more intense flavour and spice. I particularly enjoyed the chicken and the spicy shrimp.   The next set of courses: Peking duck in 2 courses (skin only and then the meaty slices) with pancakes and condiments, steamed whole fish, trio of vegetables, frog legs stew, fried rice, Vancouver crab with chilli and Szechwan peppercorns. For dessert, fried pear shaped red bean dumpling. Everything was very good but the highlight was the duck for sure! Dishes were quite spicy and intensely seasoned... Lots or water glasses bring refilled and some people started tapping out!"}
{"text":"The food is really good there. I think we ordered a little too much hence, we were stuffed after we left there. The Golden \"pear\" is really tasty. My son loved it. I am so happy that we ordered the duck  which is what this restaurant famous ed for. Overall,  it is a good experience  will come back again. Maybe will try the other location to see the difference."}
{"text":"The regular peking duck was okay, the wraps were too chewy; the dumplings were below par, also tried the hunan pork which was good.  The pear desert was good but they don't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"First, I'd like to start off with saying that Dayali has a membership card, and two locations. The membership card does not apply to both locations. It only applies to the location you bought it at. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure Dayali isn't a franchise, so this separate membership card thing seems like a bit of a money grab to me.   Second, I'd like to mention that when we made our reservation, we were given two seating times: 4:30pm or 8:15pm. Okay then.  Third, the servers don't know how to solve problems. We thought we didn't order something that came to our table, so we asked the server who brought it. He said, \"I don't know\", but made no effort to find someone who did. Along with this, they would make more money if they double-checked what people ordered. My aunt tried to do them a favor and circle the items we ordered. She missed two. The servers didn't check. Thus, there were two items we ordered that we ended up not getting, and deciding we didn't want/need anymore. I suppose this is both good and bad for us (I wanted those two dishes).  Finally, the food. Most of the food we had was just okay. We had a pork aspic, pig ear and bamboo shoot, duck tongue (more salad than tongue), fried meatballs (cute, small, juicy, crispy, but a tad salty), house special Peking duck (not worth the cost, but looks kinda special), taro rolls with some kind of sauce (sauce was missing and no taro taste, but this is a crispy, slightly sweet, yummy thing), chilled spinach with peanuts, homemade noodles in soup (half price menu section, but the more expensive half of half price...however that works), fish head with pancake, yellow croaker?, minced beef and tofu egg drop soup (good for price, but very little minced beef), duck bones with cumin (salty and not enough cumin to be called cumin flavored), sweet and sour pork ribs (not enough meat for the bones we got, and tiny ribs), boiled pork dumplings (nothing I couldn't make at home), etc. There wasn't anything particularly outstanding, or particularly good for the prices we paid. The fish head with pancake had a big fish head with very little meat. The pancake is like green onion pancake sans green onion, and the sauce was good, but for $30, I'm expecting more than starchy pancake and sauce.  All in all, I expected more. A lot more."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, for the most part, but it's definitely not cheap.  Had:  Signature roast duck - Duck skin was super crispy. Duck meat was super tender and juicy. Came with 8 flour wraps? Also came with cucumber strips, green onion shreds, deep fried potato matchsticks, craisins, spiced salt and sugar. Also hoisin sauce, cuz hoisin and duck are a match made in heaven. For $36.99 or something around that price, it's definitely not cheap, but it was worth trying. Duck bones in spicy salt ($2.88) - if you just order the duck, the bones don't come with it. Yeah. Kinda a ripoff. That being said, this is a good add-on. There is no discount for VIP's. It comes in three flavors/cooking styles. Spicy salt is the one we chose. It was heavy on the salt. That being said, the skin on the neck was crisp and the neck meat was juicy. Taro filled sesame rolls - cute presentation. Crispy exterior filled with a glutinous mashed taro concoction. It was slightly sweet and had a good chew. I liked how the ends of the rolls were dipped into sesame. This one I'd order again. Xiao long bao - for $6.99 (discounted VIP price), they're still not worth it. There's 9 of them, but they don't have soup in them. Yeah. They really shouldn't be called xiao long baos if they don't have soup in them.  spinach and peanuts - $3.99 (discounted VIP price). Fairly good portion for price, but spinach was a tad salty. Other than that, nothing to complain about. Tastes strongly of sesame oil. Signature Peking style lamb - shredded lamb (think super thin hot pot lamb) with spicy cumin salt, green onions and cilantro. Quite spicy. Other than that, quite tasty. Also a tad salty. Dayali specialty pear thing - Not actually a pear. A glutinous rice dumpling shaped like a pear. Supposedly a dessert. Wasn't sweet. Pretty, though. Some kind of minced pork pancake roll thing - I remember this one was definitely not cheap. The ingredients used to make it seemed quite cheap, though. It's like a green onion pancake with green onions and seasoned minced pork on the inside. It was crispy, but not particularly memorable.  All in all, not a bad place to eat (especially if you don't get the duck). I would suggest making a reservation, though, because at dinner on a weekday, the restaurant still filled up."}
{"text":"Change of pace from typical Chinese food.   It's a once in a while place for us.  Decor and seating is very nice.  Certain dishes can be salty.   Price is not bad (if you use the VIP card which you buy for $20 cash...bit of a scam)...there is two prices-Normal or VIP.   This place can be busy so if you have a lot of people, reserve a table.  Another thing is a lot of the staff can only speak Mandarin (English and Cantonese is optional).  Lastly only cash or debit."}
{"text":"Had dinner here today with family after a 1 hour wait. They didn't take reservations for tonight, so it was 1st come 1st serve. My family comes from northern China, so a lot of the menu options felt pretty nostalgic... until the actual food came. Typical Chinese restaurant food, i.e. very greasy, cornstarch-y, and salt-loaded. We asked for no MSG, but certain dishes like cold noodles must come with MSG due to the pre-packaged sauce. The food definitely felt more authentic than Chinatown options, but I was disappointed by the lack of truly vegetarian options (watch out for meat slices in their veggie stir fries) and the copious amount of oil.  Overall-  Food 3/5 - Taste was a times bland (i.e. the okra dish) or overcompensated by the taste of salt or spice. Unhealthy for sure. Decent portion sizes for the mains, but small serving sizes for desserts. Nothing special - I thought my family's home cooking could probably beat many of their dishes. Their Peking duck is supposed to be very famous, but we didn't order it tonight.  Value 4/5 - Not bad, e.g. $8.99 for many dishes. Family-style, would recommend ordering many dishes and sharing. Unsure if this is true for everybody, but we had to order rice/carbs separately as rice didn't come with the vegetarian dishes.  Service 4/5 - Friendly servers, but they're really busy, so infrequent service. Food takes 5-15 mins to arrive. Venue 5/5 - Large (but not large enough since HUGE long line clogging the entrance at all times) and clean. Classy looking chandliers. Clean and modern washrooms. Really loud and chaotic since many large groups and families come here."}
{"text":"Basically the Peking duck saves the day in this restaurant :( some dishes were reused from the previous opening or day, cashew nut was all soggy with oil. We had to return it along with another beef dish (forgot the name of the order) I'd strongly recommend visit this place with Chinese speaker for better communication. Overall, you're good to go as long as Peking duck is the main theme of the visit :D"}
{"text":"The service was quite poor. They forgot several dishes and had to be reminded. The waitresses and waiters were very rude and walked away mid-sentence. The food itself was mediocre and taste was just not present. The sauces and soups were all overly salty and ill prepared. The portions are reasonably sized and are adequate for sharing. Price wise, this place is not value for your $. The worst part of the meal was going in and seeing large rats at the front door, scurrying around, and coming out and seeing dozens of mice near the rocks. While there were none visible inside the restaurant, the facilities were poorly maintained. This place looks nice at first glance, but don't let it fool you.  Food: 3/10 Service: 1/10 Value: 1/10 Hygiene: 1/10 Aesthetics: 3/10  I do not recommend this place and I will not be coming back anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"My family and I had been wanting to try this restaurant for a long time.   We finally checked this place out and are quite disappointed. Although authentic, the flour wrap was quite thick compared to numerous other places we've tried. The duck wasn't very greasy, but they also didn't slice very much Peking duck, which was surprising for us. I'd say its about 2/3 of what you'd expect from most Chinese restaurants. We had the remaining of the duck put into a soup, which was a lightly flavoured, but not spectacular.  The eggplant dish was pretty tasty, but a bit on the oily side. Nothing has beaten the ones I've had in China.  The Walnut chicken is tasty, but again, a bit on the oil side and had few walnuts in it. Has some minor spiciness, but probably my favourite of all the dishes I had.  The service was good and attentive. If you call to make a reservation, you might not get seats on the same day, so it's better to show up. We had the egg dipped sweet potato fries too. A bit sweet for me, but good if you like sweet  deep fried things.  Overall, I wouldn't come back for Peking duck but the service was decent and broth was OK.  I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Came here with some guys from work.  Had Peking duck (very nice!), some kind of fish in oil (ok, kinda weird - it was some fish in about a gallon of oil and hot peppers), something with taro paste that resembled deep fried rolls (dang, those were goooood), some garlic green beans (dang, I'm going to need a pack of breath mints..), pigs' feet (fatty but fabulous), and shrimp (eaten with shell, due to laziness - call me spoiled, but I like my cooked shrimp to arrive peeled).  Probably missing something besides that.  The restaurant was clean and classy, and the food was quite good (though I admit I came in with lowered expectations due to other reviews).  The service like most Asian restaurants was sub-par and required flagging the server to get service, but that's par for the course - I don't think there's a single authentic Chinese restaurant I've been to that takes things to the extreme with service like a Western (eg. Jack Astor's) place would.  Can't comment about the value, since someone else paid, but definitely worth a return visit.  Probably a 3.5 stars but not much negative really here, so rounding up to 4.."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks very nice, but the dishes were slightly below my expectation, this place is just overrated."}
{"text":"Summary:  OVERRATED. Decent food bogged down by high prices and poor service.   My family has been planning to check this out for a while after all the hype. We were sorely disappointed.   Their signature Peking duck dish only comes with the duck skin wrap and no lettuce wrap. You get a duck bone soup or duck bones as a consolation prize.  Not worth it at all.   We ordered 2 cold dishes (vinegar chicken and sweet and sour pork ribs) which were decent.   We ordered Chinese broccoli and a spicy cabbage with pork slices for veggies. They were tasty but too oily.   Shrimp fried in coconut bits was the best dish we had. Followed by lamb slices in sour sauce (pickled veggies) on a bed of glass noodles.   In general, most dishes were too oily or salty. Reminded me of the cooking in northern China. Think all those chili oil dishes that are really greasy.   Service was non existent. No one came to clear the empty plates or change our small plates. Dishes were served without any introduction so you didn't quite know what it was.   Overall this was a disappointing experience. We were reluctant to leave a tip even though we were a party of 13. Thankfully we were seated next to clean dishes and napkins so we could serve ourselves.   I highly recommend going to Grand Lake Chinese Cuisine (Tai Woo) at Kennedy and Highway 7 for better Peking duck and seafood at very good prices."}
{"text":"This restaurant is SUPER busy. I think it's a bit over-hyped; the main reason they have so many customers is because they have a membership card that you can get for $20 and get discounts (~$1-3) on dishes. This is a restaurant chain that used to be super popular in China. I say used to be because I visited a couple of years ago and my family members there say the quality has really declined. Anyway, I can't say if that reflects on this restaurant but the brand name definitely draws people in.  The food is okay - not super great. They have some odd stuff like sweet fries breaded with salted egg yolk and what appears to be ice cream with berry drizzle but is really some kind of mashed root vegetable. Those were pretty interesting to try.  If you intend to come, call ahead. However, I think they don't allow reservations for under 5 people. After looking at the menu, you will probably consider getting a membership. Remember how long the wait time is (approximately an hour) and think carefully about how frequently you will come back to eat, and whether or not the membership is worth it."}
{"text":"It was okay, food is a more on the pricey side here. Service is poor like most people said. If you ever need anything, you'd always have to call someone over however, whatever you need, it will take forever to get if at all. The duck is good, but wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Will never go again! Poor service, had reservation and still got shuffled around until we got fed up and refused to go anywhere else. Menu is a bit pricey for the type of food your getting. Peking duck is ok, not the best I've had in Toronto considering this is their specialty. Service were poor as they can't even speak proper English to understand what you want and on top won't listen and cut you off. Food does not come with proper utensils and had to constantly remind them of food that had to come out. Will recommend you stay away, don't waste your money and time."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 4 stars but we had to wait for over 45 minutes and we were told it would only be 30 minutes. I know it's not their fault that its busy but still.  As for the food, we got the duck, sweet potato fries with duck yolk, and fried rice. The food was really good and price reasonable, but expect to wait to get a table"}
{"text":"This place is great for authentic Northern Chinese cuisine, especially the vaunted Peking Duck.  Service, however, is inconsistent. Most of the time it's just fine, but there was a case where our waiter forgot to provide us the bowls of rice we ordered. The rice came half an hour later, but in a giant bowl rather than individual ones. Other than that unfortunate mishap, they are expectedly professional."}
{"text":"Five star for the Peking BBQ Duck. Four star for other dishes. My favorite BBQ duck in GTA!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Poor service. English is not really spoken by the servers. When we tried to get their attention, their response was \"huh?\", and we had to point to what we needed. It was difficult to communicate.  Food is mediocre at best. Peking duck was not served two ways (maybe I'm just used to that and I don't know if that is an authentic way to serve) and was definitely prepared ahead of time. Oily, soggy, skin not crispy. Ordered a rice dish as well, which had a unique flavour, but my fiance found a piece of plastic in it."}
{"text":"Make reservations before coming here! The waiting area was quite packed when I arrived - good thing I made a reservation beforehand or else I'd expect the wait to be at least 15-30 mins.  Dayali's chef's recommendation was the peking duck. It came with the typical side dishes for it - the wraps, cucumbers, green onions... It also came with grapes, which I thought was a weird combination with the rest of the food..) The duck meat slices were too thin, but it was very crispy.  I'd recommend the pumpkin fries, diced spicy eggplant and especially the fatty pork with steamed buns - soo good! I wouldn't recommend the spicy fried duck though, it was too dry and too spicy for my liking."}
{"text":"Food is very very good, a bit expensive. Service could be better, but otherwise their Peking/Beijing duck is really good, (dare I say) just as good as it was in beijing."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for me.  My family and I came here for my birthday dinner. I called to make reservations the week of and got it no problem. They were pretty strict with us around seating. My aunt came half an hour earlier but they wouldn't seat her until our reservation time even though no one was at the table we got. Make reservations. This place is busy on weekends.  One waiter had a bad attitude, but service was ok. On par with what other yelpers said.  For 7 of us, we ordered:  Signature duck: the skin was crispy and the meat was flavourful. I didn't really taste the difference from other duck places so for me, it wasn't the \"best\" in town. The display of the fixings was impressive though. I give them that. A+  Black fungus: cold and soft. Not bad. B  Spinach and peanuts: I liked this dish. It was a good veggie with a nice northern Chinese spin with the peanuts. B+  Jelly fish: I liked this dish. It was very flavourful. A  Handmade glass noodles: this was delicious. Made in duck soup. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. A+  Pork ribs: oddly paired with French fries and Chinese chips. I can imagine they were there to soak up the oil. The cumin and salt was overpowering. The meat itself was dry. Was pretty disappointed by this dish. It was pricey too. C  Dried fried fish: it was paired with spam and some other veggies. It didn't look appealing, and I actually ordered the wrong thing, but it surprising tasted good. B+  Frog legs: very juicy and big legs, but extremely salty! B  Sui long bao: not any different from other places that made this. For a simple dish, it was good. B+  Onion pancakes: nothing special but tasted good. B+  Fried rice: nothing special, they didn't screw it up. B+  We didn't get any desserts because we had a cake. When they brought out the cake, there was a candle taped to the box, but the servers there were too dumb to bring a lighter.  Despite the service, I would like to come back and try their other dishes. I liked the northern China style of food prep. It's best to come with a group so you can try more dishes.  There is free parking underground."}
{"text":"Fast Read: 1) Peking Duck Skin - The must try dish 2) Other Dishes are hit and miss 3) VIP pricing on menu....ugly. 4) Great for big group as they have private room 5) Long waiting time  Good: One of the best Peking duck skin in GTA I am not sure about the new QJD, but I will say this is close to Beijing Quality.  We had a private room for 17 people.  It was a little cramped, but it's hard to have a 17 people gathering in a round table.  The other dishes are hit and miss.  Bad: Waiting time is usually long, reservation still mean long waiting time. Whoever taking reservation on the phone is a little forgetful or might mess up your date, time or name, so make sure you double check your reservation on the day.  Don't expect much service.  Ugly: VIP pricing - I personally don't like it.  Minus one star for 2 tier pricing, I feel like second class customer.    I think there's better way to do loyalty program."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, priced ok, and came fast.  The washrooms need to be a lot brighter and cleaner.  The restaurant was packed so there either needed to be more or better waiters. It was extremely hard to get their attention, almost seemed like they were ignoring us on purpose. We had to get the takeout containers and bags ourselves. And it would have been better if they knew to bring a clean set of bowls and spoons when the dessert soup was served."}
{"text":"I came here mainly to eat Peking duck. We were a table of 7. We made a reservation so we didn't have to wait in line. The line gets pretty long during dinner time.  The dishes here are very delicious and the presentation is great. I enjoyed the duck. We also ordered the signature dayali pear. It is a deep fried dough pastry, not actually a pear like we had initially thought. We also ordered sweet yams with blueberry. It was too sweet and it was served as an appetizer instead of a dessert which was a little funny to me, especially considering that the dish was cold too.  Price is reasonable too, about $30 for one duck. If you purchase a VIP card for $20, you get a discount off each dish. Their menu lists regular prices and VIP prices."}

{"text":"Worst service I've had in a while. I usually don't leave reviews but service was so bad I actually lost my appetite to eat and took my food home... and compelled me to write this yelp review... manners are non-existent with most of the staff... Peking duck was mediocre."}
{"text":"Duck is not too bad but other food are all too oily and greasy. Too salty. Customer service is slow. We asked to change table and it toke more than 10min."}
{"text":"The most disorganized operation in restaurant business. Both Markham & Richmond Hill location. First experience was 14 months ago and we had waited 2 hrs and we've asked the hostess and she just totally ignore me then we decided to leave. Our second experience was yesterday we figure to try out their Richmond Hill location, supposedly space is a bit bigger but not better. numerous of customers were screaming how come their tables were given to another people behind their line and the hostess also ignored them. We waited for an hour and I finally decided to leave and say final goodbye to this establishment."}
{"text":"Dayali used to be a place that I would go to for a good reliable peking duck when it first opened. They don't take reservations (unless you have a party over 7 people) and around typical dinner times they are pretty busy, so that wait can be about 30 minutes to an hour. This is the reason that my last two visits here were around 9:00pm - to avoid the line-ups. Both times we've been disappointed with specifically the service. We usually get the peking duck of course, but the last time it seemed like the duck as pre-cut and didn't have the typical skin crispiness to it. The eggplant was very salty, whereas it felt that the salt was missed in the duck soup! The service was horrendous. They were attentive to get your orders in, but once the food came, it was very difficult to get any service. We had to walk up and grab our take-out boxes on our own. All the waitresses and waiters were sitting at a table playing on their phones. We understood that it was near closing time, but it's still unacceptable with customers are still actively dining at the restaurant. Would I come back? I'd probably give their Steeles location a try, I've had good duck here before and I still have faith that it could be found again as this is a reputable franchise from Beijing."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last week and was disappointed about the duck and the signature breaded dayali pear with red bean.  The duck was bland and dry.  The signature dessert didn't have much red bean filing.  Got high expectations but were disappointed.  Their other dishes were good.  Taro roll with sesame dressing was the best.  It's crispy, hot and with just the right amount of filing and sweetness.  Surprisingly, it wasn't oily at all.   Came here  for lunch today, but disappointed even though we didn't order their signature duck and dessert.  The wrappings of the steamed buns with meat filings were dry and  thick.  There weren't any soup inside.  Beef soup noodle had only a few small chunks of meat. The other dishes were all very oily.  The service was awful.  It's slow and not attentive at all.  The waitress never came back after the food were served, and our tea hadn't been refilled.  Disappointed by their service and the oily food today."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing, and so good. But I have to say service is really not that good. WE booked a reservation for 6:30pm and we didn't get seated until well after 7pm. IN general service was quite slow. We ordered two orders of the peking duck - the duck is quite well roasted and the skin was crispy, so i would have to say for what they are known for, it was delivered up to standard. I also liked their toppings becuase it's more than just the celery,cucumber and carrot that usually goes with it. WE also ordered this rish dish and it was AMAZING. It literally came in a RICECOOKER lol... the waitress mixed in the sauce and evyerthing but oh my gosh that rice was so tasty and delish! BEcuase of the huge wait and being so crazy busy and the seating atmosphere isn't the greatest, I would come back eventually, but i'm not dying to come back, the food was great, i just wish their service was better."}
{"text":"I had wanted to try Dayali for so long, so my expectation could be too high, but our first lunch visit was disappointing.  We got a table fast. The services was effective if lukewarm.  The food was below expectation.  The white transparent noodle was too spicy (2 stars).  It was more spicy than Indian food.  The fried rice was just bad - some bites of rice was raw; it tasted bland; there was barely any minced meat.  It was seriously over priced at $6 (1 star).  The meat pie was the only shining star of this meal.  It tasted rich.  (4 stars).  Overall, 2 stars."}
{"text":"This review might be a little favorably biased. A few co workers brought me out for dinner and picked a place they knew I wanted to try, so I was in good spirit before we even got there. Nothing that I experienced lessened the mood at all. The place is.. elegant and tasteful.  Servers were pleasant, but I don't think our main server spoke any english.  Probably a good thing one of the party was from China. We had the duck of course and a few other dishes I do not know the names of.  Something with bacon and some kind of spicy crispy vegetable?   Chicken with eggplant, rice and the Dayali pear.  Got the pears because of reviews here, no one really wanted a pear but when I explained that they were not actually pears but a red bean pastry I got some foodie cred.  So thanks for that Yelp. Everything was great, I didn't have to pay and after the bill was paid we received a offer of a free duck on our next visit.  Great night."}
{"text":"There's a lot of signature and unique Chinese dishes here. The eggplant and tofu were both delicious, however very expensive. Similarly, the duck was also 43 dollars (nothing will ever beat real Peking duck) and came with ten shells (how are you supposed to fit an entire duck into ten small shells) so you have to buy more, and if you're willing to pay that much for duck it's fine, but it was definitely on the pricier side."}
{"text":"Over decorated and priced food, with bland and stale taste.  Duck was not fresh, soggy and no flavours at all.  Worst was the service, impatient.  RUDE and sloppy!  3 times here, not once an exception.  Piece of utter mainland crappy services imported from Beijing.  If you want the Beijing service, you can find it here!"}
{"text":"Food:  4 stars Service: 1 star  Our family of 9 (6 adults, 2 children, 1 toddler) visited the restaurant on a weeknight with a reservation at 6 p.m.  When we arrived on a particularly warm evening, the restaurant was almost full but they were not running AC which made for a very uncomfortable dining experience.  We also noticed that there was a 3 hr limit for their parking.  The restaurant strives to be nouveau luxe with its high ceiling and fairly opulent decor (well, for a Chinese restaurant) but falls short because of bad space management.  I can tell you with 99% certainly that they have crammed in too many tables for a restaurant that size.  We had a hard time getting to and from our table without bumping into someone else's chair or the serving carts and we're not large people.    Uncomfortably crammed in our table, we ordered 11 dishes and I must say, their food did not disappoint.  I did not order the dishes so I can't say for certain what they're called on the menu but I can list them from my taste memory.  Lamb with cumin, cilantro and chives, Fresh whole prawns steamed with garlic, Braised pork hock, Braised pork belly with sticky rice and buns, glass noodle in sesame broth, Regular Peking duck, Duck soup, Beef and scallion pancake wrap, Snowpea leaves in garlic sauce, Spicy daikon and carrot pickle, Steamed fish with mushrooms.    All the dishes were above average and considering the fact that my father-in-law who is from Northern China gave them a thumbs up (well, compared to other Chinese restaurants that claim to serve Northern Chinese cuisine), I'd say Dayali's saving grace is their food.  Everything else was just irritating.  We were there for a birthday dinner and we were rushed out by the staff who were busy cleaning our table as I was still feeding my daughter from a plate which they tried to take away.  It was also pretty disgusting to see one of the staff splash leftover water from one of our cups over the lazy susan to use it to clean it all the while we're still sitting there.  That's pretty brazen.    Again, no change table at a family restaurant just made the uncomfortable visit that much worse.  Would I return to Dayali?  Maybe.  But it's really just too far out of the way to go and endure the bad service again.  I would, however, consider ordering take out if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers a unique take on Chinese dishes.  The Peking duck is probably the best around Toronto.  There are spicy toad legs (they are spicy and huge) and other really authentic and delicious dishes here.  The food is more authentic and closer in style to China than HK Chinese food.  You will also notice that the menu has regular and VIP pricing.  The VIP pricing is if you have their membership card (which you can buy).  Gets super busy but they do take (and honour) reservations for larger groups."}
{"text":"Peking duck. Peking duck. Peking duck.  Pear dessert was good for $2.  Bad thing about this resto, it does not take credit cards!!!!"}
{"text":"Even though  best known for their Peking  DUCK their seafood  is equally  good and our waitress  was patient  and nice.Located in a small plaza the interior is clean and bright . looking  forward  to returning  and trying their signature dishes."}
{"text":"Returned last night with a large party, and dined in one of the private rooms.  The service was much improved over my first visit, whether this was doe to the special room or not I don't know.   The duck was every bit as delicious as before, and the pancakes, notably, were exceptional, a bit thicker and heartier, didn't stick at all, and we had no problem securing additional ones.  Stand out dishes were the tofu with crab roe, a delightful soup really, that made one colleague, from Shanghai nostalgic about home (and very happy). We also had Ru Zhu, a Beijing hot pot with various pig organs -  lung, liver, tripe, kidney.  Not for everybody for sure  but a super dish,deep funky flavour but in a good way.  Peking style lamb was just as good as visit #1, as were the roasted duck bones. The country style tofu was delectable as well.  Shredded Pig ears were a great cold dish, just the right amount of crunch. My only complaint was that all the food -- and I am not mentioning about six other dishes -- came out all at once and overcrowded the lazy susan."}
{"text":"Good place for cheaper meals at good quality. Remember to get your membership card and some dishes are almost 50% off!"}
{"text":"Came here as one of the recommended restaurants by the Globe and Mail's top 10 Chinese places in the GTA. To be honest, after trying a few of the other recommended ones I wasn't expecting to be blown away.  We had a reservation for 6 people so we didn't have to queue in the huge line (although it did seem to move quite quickly)  Ordered: Lion's head (Meatballs) Gold Medallion Peking Duck (+ fried duck bones) Peking style Lamb Country style vegetables Bullfrog (one of their 'signature' dishes, had 3 peppers meaning super spicy) Shrimp and Egg Scramble Steamed Plain Buns Spicy Eggplant Golden Pears for Dessert  The duck was kind of a let down. Yes, the plate of skin itself was crispy and delicious, and the wraps were presented nicely with all the different condiments, but I couldn't taste too much of a difference between Cantonese style Roast Duck and Dayali's Peking Duck. The Bullfrog was great, tasted like poultry, but also mind-numbingly spicy (probably as spicy as Sichuan Mapo Tofu). The meatballs and vegetables were great too, as well as the buttery/eggy goodness of the shrimp and egg scramble. The plain buns were ordered by my Chinese grandmother to dip into all the rich oily sauces (apparently Northern Chinese people didn't have rice to soak up those sauces so they either made noodles or bread). The eggplant was great too, only 'one pepper' on the spicy chart. Would pass on the deep fried duck bones though, after the novelty of knawing on the first one it was a little too much. The pears weren't that great; mostly fried outter batter with very little red bean filling inside which is a major negative for a red-bean lover like myself!  We bought the VIP card ($20, valid for 3 years), which entitles us to 1-2 bucks off per dish, but it was moderate to a little expensive (approx 22 per person after tax and tip) for a Chinese restaurant.  Didn't mind the service too too much, it's more about the food for me - but on that note I would say it's Ok if you want an indulgent rich meal once in awhile."}
{"text":"Will not repeat.  Poor service - late arriving guest at our big table, staff provided him with a cheap plastic folding chair, despite available empty dining chairs throughout the dining room.  No soap - in the men's room, I asked an employee to refill the empty soap dispenser. He asked and came back telling me \"they have no more soap\". So, how do the employees wash their hands?  Poor duck - this part was unfathomable. The wrappers were tired and dense chewy.  - From a summer 2016 experience."}
{"text":"I was actually pleasantly surprised after today's visit because I came here on two occasions about half a year ago and really disliked this place.  However, I went with a bunch of friends today and was quite surprised.   Wait time: It's a busy restaurant - be prepared to wait.  A smart thing to do is if you are with a small group, share a table with another small group.  Your wait time will shorten by a lot.   Peking Duck (regular) - We ordered the regular one and there were 4 of us.  It was pretty good.  The only thing is that there weren't enough blinis for the 4 of us but when we ordered another plate, we ate less than half of it.    Chinese broccoli - This was cooked in a broth and while it made the vegetables flavourful, a fore-warning is to not drink the broth as it is quite salty.   Duck soup - We added $2 to get a duck soup.  Personally, I found the soup quite bland and nothing special.  Not worth it unless you really like soup with your dinner. It was, however, a very big portion.   Lamb & spring onion dish - This one was very good.  The lamb was pleasantly spicy and there was a nice strong cumin flavour - but not overbearing.  I highly recommend this to lamb and spicy lovers!   Overall, I think you just have to order the right stuff.  One time, we ordered these yam fries - do not do it!!! It was horrible.  Their spicy dishes seem to be their specialty though."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 6 ppl. Had the typical duck, and other dishes. Been several times and was better before. I have the VIP card so it was pretty reasonably priced. The VIP is $20 good for 2 years and each dish is a couple bucks cheaper. So technically if you went once with a group of 5 of more the $20 dollars is there already. Good catch to get ppl to go back.  Service is a bit off. It's really hard to find a server. Without VIP most likely won't go back"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a couple of times after reading good reviews and word of mouth. I first came here with my coworkers and it was good. We ordered the signature duck, diced eggplant, sweet and sour cold noodles, fried rice, and some others I do not remember. The second time I came, I brought my family.  We ordered the signature duck, pork hock, Chinese broccoli (which was not available and we were given yu choy instead), spicy stir fried beef, sweet and sour pork tenderloin, sweet and sour cold noodles, and diced eggplant, which never came to the table, so we cancelled it.  The food was decent, but not great and not worth the price we paid for it, particularly the duck. It was incredibly fatty. My family (parents and grandmother) were disappointed that they didn't slice the duck at the table and that the food was nothing spectacular as they could make the same dishes at home.  This restaurant seems to be getting too much hype and it's not as good as some people say it is.  Service: Terrible. Staff not attentive and not friendly. First of all, make sure you make reservations when you get there. I was calling all evening on Tuesday and and Wednesday morning but it was constantly busy. I couldn't find the hours of operation anywhere online..so I assume that they are closed on Tuesdays? Secondly, there is one waitress there who was there both times I dined and she was not friendly at all. During my most recent visit, she came to our table twice and when we asked for more time, she stated that we have to order quickly because there was another group coming in at 7:45pm..Very rude. Third, when we got to the restaurant and were  told where our table was, the guests from another table was in the process of taking our place settings and chairs for their own tables. The wait-staff took at least 10 minutes before they replaced everything.  i don't think I would ever return again."}
{"text":"I remember few years back, this place was packed and parking at this plaza was full. Last night we were there, everything was empty. I guess many similar restaurants are opened near by and this places wasn't as good anymore.  The dishes we had weren't that great but was okie. We can eat better dish somewhere else. For example, we had this vegetable dish, but the vegetable was tasteless, so we dipped the soya sauce below but it still tasteless, so what you need to do is to mix everything first and then put in a spoon to eat. For the peking duck I don't see much difference from other places but they have more options to choose from as duck dishes after they skinned the duck. For the dumpling, the meat in the dumplings were tasteless too, I guess if you look at the positive side, it's healthy :)  If someone invite me to go there again, I might recommend them somewhere else."}
{"text":"Never had the Peking Duck dining experience and was thrilled to have a local transplant from China to guide me through the menu. Without her, I'm not sure how the experience would have gone.  I expected a tasty treat of an experience, and was rewarded.  Service was extremely busy, and I'd hope they could hire additional help."}
{"text":"Pretty fancy place inside, quite a few chandlers and they have 2 private room, it's a small place tho, they don't take reservations unless more than 6 ppl, we waited 45mins on a Monday night....major language barrier if you don't speak mandarin or fluent cantonese, the waitress couldn't even understand me when I requested more tea......service is pretty shitty here, they barely came over to take our empty plates away  On the good note, the food comes out reallyyyyy quick surprisingly, the duck was the highlight of the night obviously since this place specializes in duck....the duck was very juicy and tender, extra wraps are $4 for 10 ppl, the homemade noodles were good as well, other than that everything was either mehhhhh and nahhhhhh Pretty pricy of you don't have a VIP card here, thankful we had one  I would only come back here just for the duck and the noodles  Oh yea another good think about this place is that they have a picture menu book for us illiterates lol"}
{"text":"Oh Dayali! Why do so many people go crazy over your food? I don't get it. Perhaps I'm used to Cantonese style food, but it's not just that. Your fried dishes taste and smell like your oil has not been changed in several months. Your duck has potential, and so do your beef noodles, but I've had better. Yet, the wait time and the line-ups are long!! The presentation of some of the dishes is great: blueberry & mashed yam and the deep fried pears. The service is also awful, good luck flagging someone to get some water; however, I promised that the stars they got would not be based on service because I have come to expect this. I was really hoping to give you 5 stars based on how popular you seem to be ... oh well, maybe next time."}
{"text":"Terrible service. If there is zero star, I will choose it. Slow service messed up order. 15 minutes just waiting in front desk to pay. Wtf?!!"}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant enough to make excellent use of the VIP card. Generally, the food is very good and plentiful. This time, though, something happened beyond the apparent menu change.   We chose the regular duck over the signature duck this evening. The duck is pretty good compared to the duck I've had at several popular places in Beijing. Tonight, the duck was moist and delicious, but the skin could have been a bit crispier. Not a big deal. The pancakes, however, were served on a plate instead of the usual steamer. Since the pancakes are so thin, they quickly became too dry. I am not sure what motivated the restaurant to switch to a plate for service.  I noticed there is an option for duck bones now which we gladly ticked off on the menu. I chose the cumin-spiced option and I'm wondering if the take home box of bones will make it to midnight before I eat them.  Normally, I would choose the slow cooked pork with steamed buns or the pork shoulder casserole but this time we chose pork liver with wood ear and vegetable. We considered sending the dish back because the starch had separated out of the sauce leaving a clear puddle of oil on the place and clumps stuck to liver. It's too bad because the liver was tender and cooked well but suffered for the fatal flaw in the preparation of sauce. The garlic and few carrots in the dish were undercooked, as well. It's like someone was not paying attention when the dish was being prepared. We had never experienced that until tonight.  I have a weakness for bean noodle and spicy sauce but this time we ordered spinach and peanut as a cold dish. It was okay, but left me wanting for the noodles. Usually upon ordering, I immediately get excited because I know that the cold dish should be arriving soon. However, the spinach dish didn't arrive until we had already started eating the hot dishes.  A carb fix with satisfied with an order of corn bread which arrived hot and moist. It was that or the meat pancake which is always tasty.  Dayali, I imagine, strives to be a family oriented restaurant with family sized portions that offer good value. Of the all times I have dined here over the past few years, I'm sad to say that the quality tonight was really off the mark. I feel like something has changed, and it's not just the menu. I want to come back, but I'm apprehensive now."}
{"text":"Dayali seems to be a pretty popular restaurant, but I'm really not sure why. We went on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was filled. A big group of people were waiting to be seated but we got a seat right away since we were just a party of 3. Ordering is through checking off items on a sheet. A very nicely printed and bounded photo menu showcasing their food was provided. From that, I had pretty high hopes for the food but was soon disappointed.   The servers were not attentive and the whole environment was too cluttered. We did not get a complete set of utensils and none of the servers noticed until we asked. We ordered 4 items which came one at a time. The last dish did not arrive until we were almost done eating and after we inquired about it.   Dayali's concept of good food is just to drown everything in oil. We ordered the Sliced Boiled Fish but what came was a tub of oil. It's true that the flavor wasn't bad, but I couldn't eat more than two pieces of the fish due to the amount of grease coating each piece. This was labelled with 3 chili but wasn't spicy at all. In comparison, the Stewed Duck Wings labelled as one chili was 10x more spicy. Overall, the meal was disappointing. Perhaps the signature Beijing duck could've redeemed the experience slightly but I really don't care to go back again to try."}
{"text":"Ordered Beijing duck and an assortment of dishes for 10+ people. As a beijinger, I have a great deal of pride in my hometown but food is not one our specialties. Same for the restaurant, everything is too salty. The duck was good but nothing you couldn't get somewhere else. I have to recommend people sat away from Beijing food (not necessarily this restaurant)"}
{"text":"This place gets two stars only because of the crab stew. I'll start with the only thing thing I liked about this restaurant. The crab stew was delicious, the sauce was rich and flavourful. A wonderful combination of savory, sweet and spicy with a medley of flavours and textures. The potatoes and rice noodles were perfect and absorbed the sauce so nicely. The meat was soft and fell off the bone and the crab meat was sweet and tender. The shrimp was slightly over cooked though so it was tough to get it off of the shell.  Now to the reasons I'll never be back.  This shouldn't even be called Peking duck. If it was called roast duck with wrappers and toppings and the price was more reasonable I'd probably be less critical. We ordered the standard style Peking duck, the pieces of duck skin were dripping with fat and had substantial amounts of fat attached to the skin. There was even fat pooling at the bottom of the serving platter. Peking duck should be crispy! With that much oil even the crispiest skin would become a soggy mess. The wrappers were so dry it was like eating paper and the portion of cucumbers was barely enough to finish the wrappers. Also, they did not provide a spoon for texting housing sauce.  And it costs $35 for only *one* course, which makes it just shy double the cost of every other Peking duck place I've seen in markham ($40 for 2 courses)! The lettuce wraps aren't even available here. Overpriced and poorly made.  Then, the service. I tried asking get how many courses were included with the Peking duck, waitress number one snatched the  order sheet and then walked off without answering, waitress number two was in too much of a hurry to answer a question about the Peking duck as well. The third waitress was nice and helpful but the service aside from her was horrible. They even forgot to bring us our rice, we ordered a few bowls of plain steamed rice and had to remind the waitress about the order. I'm used to service at asian restaurants, my family adores going to Chinese and Japanese restaurants but this was hands down the worst service I've ever encountered.   If it wasn't for the service I might have considered going back for the stew, but I could never recommend their Peking duck to anyone."}
{"text":"Clean and quick service. Good menu selection. I am not a northern Chinese good expert so I can't comment on authenticity.  Not being to eat spices, I still have a good range of dishes to choose from. Stable good quality."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant it has my favorite dish yAs I love it here. So full ordered too much good but they are too delicious? this restaurant only accepts cash and debit card though"}
{"text":"Finally a real Beijing franchise (unlike the fake Quan Ju De in China Town) I was really excited and asked my relative in Beijing for recommendations. They told me not to expect much since Da Ya Li is not well liked by real Beijingers.  Obviously my taste buds are a bit spoiled by real Peking duck in Beijing, my first thoughts on the food is about the same. It's not that special. The sliced duck isn't as crispy and thin as what I had in Beijing. Aside from that, they obviously didn't serve a whole duck portion of sliced duck skin and meat for one order.  Good things about this restaurant: - nice decor - clean and well renovated washrooms (very rare in Chinese restaurants) - VIP card ($20 for 3 years) for discounts.   Things I'm not impressed with - does not allow reservation for parties of 4 or less - servers are rude at times  My fave dishes - scrambled egg with shrimp $4.99 with VIP card"}
{"text":"You should make reservation for this restaurant. Service wasn't the best but it's still ok. Servers were to busy to pay attention to you but still nice when you asked for service. Cash and debit only. Get the membership card for discount. I've bought by membership for $20cad one 8/2017 and it's good for 2 years. Foods were awesome."}
{"text":"Food was ok but service was HORRIBLE!!! They had so much attitude...we booked a large VIP room 9 adults, 5 kids and two babies, they said the room only fit 12 ppl so the two waitresses from the front kept giving us attitudes and cut eyes...but it was a CNY dinner so we decided to ignored them and we ordered full table of foods for example Peking duck, steamed fish...etc.(the pic only showed half of the food we ordered).  They told us our time slot is 5-7:30 and then gave us the bill at 7, the bill is $565 and we gave them less tips(10%) for their services."}
{"text":"I've had some varied experiences at Dayali.  Order the right things and you're good; order the wrong things and oh man can it get weird really quickly.  So first thing first, always get the peking duck.  Don't even think about it, just do it.  If they just served peking duck and nothing else, they would probably get at least 4/5 stars.  Everything else, proceed with caution.  So the last time I went here, we ordered the set menu because there was 8 of us and we got served some of the weirdest foods I've eaten, and I've eaten some weird stuff.  Here's a few that topped it:  - Deep fried yam fries with a coating of duck egg yolk - Savoury egg flan with dried seafood that was really pungent - Frog legs (which is fine), with spices that numb your mouth, literally.  Like how your tongue feels after you got your cavity filled. - Pigs ear in gelatin, served cold - Salad with cold chicken hearts  I pretty much eat anything, so I still ate the food.  It was just weird.  My friends kind of just stared and gawked at it a bit.  They also do the whole upselling bit that was really annoying.  They would say that they only have the larger lobster and not the 3.5 advertised on the menu so that's an extra $100 dollars.  Or they don't have the fish and they try to substitute it with something else that was less expensive.  Service overall reeked.  The peking duck is still good though, and most of the soups are probably safe, at least the ones I've tried."}
{"text":"terrible service; employees completely ignored us when ordering, treating us as if we didn't exist. Had to call for them at least thrice before they showed up. If it was possible, I would give this place 0 stars overall. The place looks luxurious, but the food sure isn't. food: generally very oily, presentation sucked area: untidy, space around bar ruined my appetite. our table was also dirty when we arrived and they didn't bother to clean it up. also, our eating utensils were not washed properly."}
{"text":"I have come to this Dayali location several times since they opened, it can get quite busy on weekends so reservations are a must.. though I find that even with reservations, you still have to wait 10-15 minutes for your table.  First off, Dayali offers authentic nothern Chinese food so it really is a hit or miss depending on your preference..some dishes can be too much for my liking.  One very popular dish at Dayali is their peking duck, which comes in two sizes..the smaller one is a small plate of duck, wraps and one plate of each topping (sauce/onions/cucumbers)..the larger one comes with more toppings and slightly more duck, which is the one displayed very nicely in some of the pictures fellow yelpers have posted. You can add $3 to get a large bowl of duck soup which is very delicious and flavourful.  The prices here are very reasonable for their large portions, if you buy a membership card ($20, valid for one year) you get the discounted price on the menu, usually a few dollars off every item.  This restaurant is usually very busy and all of them speak mandarin, little to no staff speak/understand cantonese and english; it is quite difficult to comminicate if you do not know the language. The decor in the restaurant is nice, but they do not do any upkeep, so you can tell that the decor gets quite dusty."}
{"text":"Came to dayali on a cold rainy weekday for dinner at 7 30pm. Lucky for us that we were seated immediately. Our waitress told us that usual weekday nights for a party our size we would require reservation to skip the wait.  When dayali opened few years back, it was always a special treat for us to come and enjoy Peking duck. (Also because mom had special membership card which had since expired.) But this time that we came, our Peking duck was served almost immediately after we put in the order and was not hot. Everything else we ordered was nothing too special either. My all time favourite Chinese yam with blueberry sauce lost its special touch as well."}
{"text":"I was debating between 3 stars and 4 stars. Wish I can do 3.5 star. Services was not great, not worst but we had to constantly looking for the waitress. Beijing duck was bad but the rest of the food was good. For the price, it's worth the try and the seating is pretty comfortable.  Don't get the Beijing duck."}
{"text":"The food is actually great here. The service is not bad, but english is not their forte so you need to have someone who knows what they're ordering here in chinese. Mandarin is the main language. My fav dishes are: glass noodles, broccoli, spicy frog leg skewers, but mostly everything is done well. Haven't had a bad dish here, unless its not to my taste which isn't the quality of the dish. My friends love the jellyfish and peking duck. The egg yolk battered sweet potato fries are great too. Very busy and loud. Generally very clean and well decorated!"}
{"text":"Lunch time during a long weekend was pretty quiet. No complaints about no reservations or rushed service for us.   Peking duck was good, not great.  But definitely not bad. A little pricey, though. Me and my wife enjoyed the BBQ bullfrog, for $3 a piece, why not!  Kids also loved the sweet and sour pork."}
{"text":"great food. maybe im just used to it but I dont mind the impersonal service or the loud chatter.  Been impressed both times I've been to this resto. Just make sure to make a reservation before hand because there is always a line.  Food is bit pricier than other chinese \"banquet hall\" style restaurants (with the big round tables)."}
{"text":"Service is pretty good. Cost is fair for the type of food. Quality of food is pretty good. Had the Peking duck, croaker fish, pepper lamb, salt and pepper beef tenderloin and spinach. Overall I do like it and would come back."}
{"text":"DaYaLi Beijing Roast Duck is a chain from China. Came in a group of 5, and they told us that they don't have tables for 5 and that we had to squeeze into a table for 4. I assume they didn't want to waste a table for 6 (round table) on us and rather seat us at a table for 4.   We came here at 6:30 on a Thursday night and had to wait about 20 minutes. Wasn't too bad, and somewhat expected. Given that it's a mainland China chain, there were alot of people from mainland china here. Lots of mandarin, very little canto. Servers first reaction is to speak in mandarin...not canto and definitely not english.   You're able to purchase a membership (which I believe is $20). Members pay discounted prices. Otherwise the non-member prices are generally $1 or $2 more per dish. Seems like its only worth it if you come often.   We ordered 8 dishes for 5 people and it WAY was more than enough food.   We got the regular order of the peking duck and not the fancier version. I think the main differences are (1) more condiments (e.g. grapes, etc.) and (2) the wrappers are heated by a candle. The peking duck was very good and was the highlight of the meal.   Ordered a bunch of different things. All of which were disappointing:  - Fried grated potatoes...which weren't fried and basically boiled and soaked in soy sauce - Spicy chicken was okay. Essentially like popcorn chicken.  - Baked pumpkin was not crispy at all. Very soggy.  - Steamed soup dumplings were packed into a tin steamer and not that good  - Scallion pancakes were decent   Would say duck was a 4, other dishes are 1-2. Service is 2.... so overall 3 seems a little bit generous. If I were to come back again, I would just get duck."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad at all. As a chain store in China, i expected much worse, but the food was good. They are of course famous for their duck, which is great. The extra set up isn't really necessary on the side of the duck, or the order of deep fried duck bones - but hey i had to try it and probably won't do the adds on again.  Flavour wise, it's great. If you think you're going to come here often enough, they have a VIP card for 10 or 20 bucks which gives you a pretty decent discount everytime you go."}
{"text":"I'm not picky or a Beijing Roast Duck connoisseur so I only have compliments about their duck. The duck skin was crispy and tasted great; they serve the entire dish with cucumber, the wrap, the paste, and a green onion. There's actually 2 different ducks you can order, the cheaper one just comes with that standard stuff (what I usually order).  This place is really popular and doesn't allow reservations for less than 6 people, so I usually come for lunch and show up around 1hr after it opens on a weekend.   Service is decent, we were never really left waiting. Ordering is easy, you just check things off on a piece of paper.   In general, their dishes may seem a bit pricier compared to other places but I find them all very good. You can get a VIP card that gives you 10% off every dish, if you pay 20$. The VIP card is valid for 2 years."}
{"text":"We went on my birthday and to be honest I was very disappointed . We ordered gold medal duck for $38.88 which is overpriced. I didn't see the duck but a small plate of duck skin and a medium plate of duck skin with meat. It Tasted ok but that's \"Toronto\" standard. Everything else was terrible . Either tasteless or too salty or too dry. I don't think we will go again ."}
{"text":"We were craving for some authentic Beijing duck so my friends recommended this place. We had a late breakfast so at noon we didn't order too much, only two dishes for two people.  We had the duck 34.88$ and duck skeletons deep fried for extra 2.88$. That was a good deal for a side dish.  The duck tasted OK but the slices were too thick. The pita was so dry and they broke when wrapping the duck. Such a shame. I gave up the pita and only ate the meat.  All in all the duck was average.  The service was not nice. Waitress were chatting with each other all the time. The tablewares were very dirty. Other customers had to send the tableware back for clean ones. I just wiped my plate myself."}
{"text":"Dayali's on point with their peking duck! The duck was really moist and was just perfect with the hoisin and spring onion. The restaurant is nice and clean staff is attentive. Great chinese restaurant addition"}
{"text":"Food is good and there are lots of choices on the menu. It's a busy spot so you may have to wait. The downside is very slow service and food arrives at a very slow pace. Full bar. Underground parking is nice too."}
{"text":"Cantonese BBQ duck has more authenticity than this? Some of the comments made my day. No, the reason peking duck is called peking duck is because it is originated from Beijing, the northern Chinese, it is totally different style than Cantonese restaurant. If you want Cantonese style, please stick to Chinatown.  Also, 38.88 CAD is not that pricy for peking duck in Beijing, and this is Toronto. And naturally, how peking duck is served is you only get the best cut of the meat, the rest, with the bones, the duck confit, goes to the soup.  I'm not saying their duck is that good, if I were in China I would never come to this chain. But at least it is peking duck in Toronto and I don't have to chew on the bones when I eat my duck like barbarians do."}
{"text":"Not the best:  1.  Waiters walk through the waiting area with uncovered food as a short cut to various parts of the dining area.  It is unappetizing to know my dinner unnecessarily passed through a crowd.  2.  It is certainly a popular restaurant - whether it is good or not is another story.  Considering it is surprisingly fortunate to have people waiting to eat, they should develop a better system for telling guests when their table is ready.  Instead of providing a beeper or texting the patrons on their phones, they rely upon an overwrought maître de who periodically yells out numbers in Chinese.  3.  Our waiter was not user friendly.  I went to the restaurant with my wife and son (three of us together).  We sat at a table for four people.  The waiter hurriedly served all our dishes and tea in the empty place at the table, which was inconvenient.  The waiter also was rude in failing/refusing to answer questions or being short in his responses.  We asked for spoons, which were not provided until after the third time we asked.    Sure, the restaurant is busy -- but at these prices and after a long wait for a table, my family and I deserved far better service.  Dissatisfied customer."}
{"text":"This place is pretty pricy for the quality and portion of food they provide here. Inwent there two or three times back when I had their VIP card promotion with the dishes getting $1-2 discounts, but even then my family didn't really enjoy the food as much as we wanted to given the discount. I found out after the fact that this place was on the  list of restaurants had food safety issue  in the  past and has since changed owners. My extended family decided to try this place again and I'm surprised there's still a lot of people eating here despite the quality of food. Service was mediocre at best, and if you don't speak Cantonese or Mandarin here you're going to have a hard time with the servers. In my most recent visit here we ordered a duck soup and got a lamb soup instead. After we told the server the server took the lamb soup away without saying a word and brought back the duck soup after a couple of minutes...without a word! I speak Chinese and they don't even bother communicating with us. There are much better restaurants around there I would not bother to go to this place again."}
{"text":"This place is not what you think. Not only the quality of food is bad but the servers are like a bunch of headless chickens running around.  We ask them for stuff they immediately forget about it and there is just no management.  The peking duck was terrible. Im sorry to say our duck was luke warm and the wrap was ice cold. Then the braised pig thigh was dry and chewy. Alot of the other foods that we order was no taste except for heavy vinegar flavor.  Couldnt taste anything else."}
{"text":"This has been my very favourite Pecking Duck place since it opened in 2014! And it still is in 2018! Its the first real Pecking Duck place in Toronto. The canto styles ducks are 'roast duck' , not the real Pecking Duck \"beijingtianya\". This is a chain store straight from Beijing!  Their Pecking Duck is the best in Toronto I would say, compared to the newer ones like QuanJuDe, Dragon Buffet...  Some people say they have bad service, but you go to this place for the delicious duck you cannot find anywhere else, not for the service!  Also, in Chinese restaurants, you HAVE to wave your hand at the server, so you will never get served! Lol it's just different cultures. When in Rome, do as the Romans do...  Their duck is really specially because the super crispy skin!! It literately melts in your mouth. If you get the full version of the duck around $40... dip the just crispy skin (without the meat) in sugar... it's heavenly!  Also, with the full version, you can get plenty of cucumbers and scallions for your wraps!  QuanJuDe is another chain restaurant serving Beijing duck, but is 3 or 4 times the price. I have to say their duck skin is not nearly as crispy or melt in your mouth as these ones.  Also, out of all my years of going there, I have had bad ducks here as well. Sometimes the duck is really pale, it's not roasted properly. Once, it was a bit sale, not crispy enough. Then I figured out a pattern! They have the best chef on Friday and weekends. So if you go on a Wednesday lunch, you may get a stale duck...  I also recommend getting the duck soup to go with the duck. It's really good for just an additional 2.99 or something. It's that cheap because you are paying the duck already.   Other than that, their dishes for other Chinese food are also really delicious!"}
{"text":"Dayali makes Peking duck as well as I've ever had it, even in China. If duck is your priority, go there and try all the unusual condiments that come with it.   If good service is part of your enjoyment, maybe get your Peking duck elsewhere. It flagrantly favoured Chinese guests and larger parties. We were 2 and nearly the only non-Chinese, so I practically had to trip a server to get some attention. English proficiency to explain foods was a problem, but hardly unique to Dayali.  If you want more than duck, the rest of the extensive menu was intriguing but much of it was unusual and we're versed in Chinese cuisines. A mixed vegetable and a fried rice dish were very good, as was a novel (to us) cold fungus. We'd like to have tried others but I asked our server about a few selections and was told we wouldn't like it, so we stayed with the more or less familiar. I'd gladly go back as part of a group including Chinese as cultural bridges.    Dayali is cash or debit only, no credit cards."}
{"text":"You do get what you paid for, even though it's a bit pricey. Menu is quite vast so you get a lot of choices. Only thing that didn't made sense to me was the \"membership\" thing. Note: Be sure to make a reservation.   In a tiny plaza/square behind the T&T supermarket at Warden, where the Chatime is, you almost wouldn't expect this kind of place to exist here. Parking lot is small so it can be hard to find a spot if you come here on the weekend, especially when that Chatime is always packed.  The restaurant itself is quite spacious, not what you would expect from the outside. Decor is also modern, clean, and very bright. The waiting area is a decent size for a Chinese place so you won't be shoulder to shoulder with people hungry for a spot.  Dishes are a good size. Personally I think this place is good for groups and not a 1 on 1 dinner kinda thing. Must try is the Peking Duck and wrap; comes in a nicely organized presentation with a heater to keep the duck and wraps warm, which was a pretty simple but smart idea. We ordered a number of dishes since we had a bigger group but tbh pretty much everything on their menu (at least the ones you've heard about) are pretty good. They are a bit on the salty and greasy side, but as is with most Asian food.  Don't think I'll be a frequent customer but the dishes were pretty good. At least not something you can find everywhere in town.  Prepare to see the bill at a good number though because this place is not cheap."}
{"text":"Its ok, that's it.  Not very impressed with the Peking Duck...the wrap was cold, and the duck serving seemed small.  I know there is a 2 hour limit on dining, but I felt pushed out by the wait staff...not cool at all."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is getting all the bad reviews. I have been here a few times and it's honestly not that bad. Giving it a 3 star because of the terrible service and the place is a bit filthy.   Food wise - we came here for Peking duck, they do a pretty good job in comparison to a lot of other Chinese restaurants in the GTA. Obviously you can never compare to the quality back home but it's really not that bad! The skin is charred perfectly! Other items on the menu are pretty delicious and well made as well.   Service - well it's a typical Chinese place, what service are we talking about? Just doesn't make any sense to me though because the place is considered fancy with the decor and everything. Hours are weird.. we came here for late dinners both times at around 8ish... the staff started to kick people out at 9:45pm... really, why?  Overall - I would come back despite of the service. Where else can you have cheap and delicious Peking duck otherwise?"}
{"text":"We, party of 12, decided to come here for dinner. We were celebrating our friends' new born baby. Since I know the owner of this restaurant, he got us a VIP room which was quiet and the decor was quite nice.   This review is solely based on my experience here so there's no bias here since I know the owner.   Dayali, that's pretty much Peking Duck written all over it in Chinese name. My expectations were quite high for this joint. The Peking Duck arrived 5 minutes later when we got our orders in, leading me to believe they prepare them ahead of time. Why can't they cut the duck in front of us like other restaurants, such as Peking Man?!  It's suppose to be part of the experience to have it cut in front your table. The Peking Fuck we ordered was fatty and skin were soft. Isn't suppose to be crispy?!  We also find that our other dishes we ordered were super oily and saucy. Gave me heart burns and had to take Tums.   Will we come back again?  In terms of food, not for awhile.   Food:  2/5 Ambience:  4/5 Service:  3/5 Cleanliness:  4/5"}
{"text":"Literally so disappointed by this restaurant. We missions about 30 min from North York to get here for some Peking duck since it was named one of the best. When we first got there, we were pretty excited since it was pretty clean - surprising for a Chinese restaurant. When we looked at the menu, we found that a lot of traditional Chinese dishes were not present. One of my favourite soups, the corn soup, was not anywhere to be seen. Nor were any noodle dishes like really? No chow mein. In the end we decided on beef and egg soup, Kung pow shrimp, Peking duck - traditional, and the stir fry Chinese broccoli.   In terms of food, it was absolutely horrendous. The beef and egg soup contained so much cilantro that I could not even eat a scoop of it. The Kung pow shrimp was just bad. Had to wash it down with some sprite after. For the Peking duck, we were disappointed to say the least. Especially compared to the Peking Man restaurant that I reviewed before, the portion size was surprisingly small and did not come with many options. There was the bread dough thing with some sauce, green onion and cucumber. Gladly, they did give us some more when we requested it. Now the stir-fry broccoli were the only thing that we could eat. It wasn't very filling but we had to eat something.   Our bill totalled to about $100 for 4 people but it was definitely not worth the trip or the money. If you're looking for a good Peking duck place I'd much rather suggest anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"The food itself is interesting - they serve Northern Chinese cuisine, and the plate sizes are a bit smaller than the usual Chinese \"sharing\" plates.   We tried the Peking duck, which was fine - it wasn't anything that'll blow your mind, but it's served in a cute duck dish. Also tried the braised pork hock, which was fan-TAST-ic! Fall off the bone and the skin fatty-noms. To offset all this fatness, we ordered the black fungus dish cooked in chicken broth, which was had a good crunch to it. Next was the fatty pork with white buns - so very fatty, so very delicious. This was the BF's fave dish, and it really NEEDS those white buns - otherwise it's just too intense of a dish! We finished off with a veggie dish in spicy oil. This was just SLATHERED in oil, and wayyy to overwhelming with the spice. Rather than waste it, I just rinsed off some of the oil/spice with hot tea.  The service was not great. The wait was almost 40 minutes, and there was no reservations allowed of groups fewer than 7. Whenever we called the waiter over, there was never a smile or acknowledgement when we asked for something. Ex. Can we get more tea please? response: walks off.   Overall, the food was good in flavour, but simply too oily. The black fungus, the pork hock, the fatty pork - all of them were soaked in oil. This may be the style of cooking, but excessive all the same."}
{"text":"The deco is nice but food is really average, tried the regular rosted duck (not the gold medal one which comes with heated wrap and peeled skin), it is definitely not as so called best in GTA. It is ok but no better than other places I've been to like Peking Man. The wrap is too dry & thick, the scallion &Cucumber is not enough. The worst thing is, you have to wait for an hour to get the duck after you are seated, not to mention the tremendous wait time at the gate. Price wise it's at the middle range ($20/ea for us). Considering the wait time I'll definitely not come back."}
{"text":"The Peking was nothing special. I personally found the duck a little disappointing. The pieces were small and some of the pieces were dry. The pastry to duck ratio was off as a result of the small pieces. In terms of the taste of the duck, I did not particularly enjoy it as the sauces that was included did not pair well with the pastry and the meat. The presentation of the dish was good,  and there was good variety in terms of the side dishes.  In addition to the duck, we ordered the \"Lion Head\" meatballs, Siu long bao dumplings, fried dumplings and a bunch of other dishes that was neither bad or amazing. In total our party ordered 15 dishes and nothing really wowed us. Despite the disappointment in terms of the food, the service was really good, our server was very helpful.  Our group ordered 15 dishes in total and the bill  came up to just under $200, which is very fair in my opinion.  Overall, I felt like this restaurant was below average and although the price was very fair, we could have spent the same amount of money at another restaurant and had a better experience."}
{"text":"I've been to the original location several times and they were always really busy especially when it first opened. I came here a couple times as well with larger groups and its okay. We always get two of the Peking Duck which is not bad, but I've definitely had better. I liked the salad, eggplant, and cumin lamb dishes we ordered. We also ordered a soup which I didn't care for as well as some appetizers/dim sum dishes which were all average to sub par. In general, I thought the duck was okay for the price but all the food was too salty/oily for my liking. I somehow always end up coming back here with people who want to eat duck but it would not be my first pick for dinner. Decor is fine, typical for what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant in the area. Service is really hit or miss though. With that said,"}
{"text":"The food is microwaved,  what restaurant does this? We order a few dishes, most of it taste not fresh, and one of them is cold,but the plate is warm, we asked the server, and she said, the dish is made in the morning by their chef, and they just microwave it, she can take it back and microwave is again. I would never go their again!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to give this place a try after driving past the plaza a few times and seeing the constant mob of people waiting to get in (it must be good if everyone goes there right?).  We decided to go early (ie. 5PM for dinner) and still had to wait a good 20 minutes before getting seated.    Of course we had to try their duck, which was (as expected) good.  The skin was very crispy and the duck itself was tasty.  The presentation of the flour wraps was different and interesting, but the wraps themselves were kind of dry. They had all the standard side condiments that you would expect for the duck, but if you want more there is a charge. We also tried their dumplings, where were very standard.  You can get good northern style dumplings at many other dumpling restaurants in the GTA.  We wrapped our our meal with a cold noodle and fried veggies which were both pretty good, although nothing to rave about.  Overall I would recommend this restaurant if it were not for the ridiculous wait.  I don't think there is anything that extraordinary here that I would wait 40+ minutes in line for.  As we were leaving the restaurant after our meal, we had to weave our way towards the door, I guess we should be happy with our initial 20 minute wait."}
{"text":"Dayali newest location just opens up in Richmond Hill.  The interior feel a lot more spacious and with more small tables good for 2 or 4 people which is welcoming since reservation is not accepted for 5 or more people.  Obviously, one should be ordering Beijing Roast Duck but for tonight I decided to try out other items on their huge menu.  Stewed Large Meatballs in Brown Sauce ($3) ??? - A-OK but was a little cold when served  Sauteed Shredded Pork in Sweet Bean Sauce ($9.99) ???? - standard  Stir-Fried Pea Sprouts ($9.99) ????  - standard  Steamed Buns with Meat Fillings ($6.99)  ?????  Rice Noodle in Spicy and Sour Broth ($3.29)  ??? - lack spiciness or sourness, cheap carb filler  Signature Breaded Da Ya Li Pear ($2) ??? - My favourite item of the meal, #everythingtastebetterdeepfried  Though there were only 2 tables at 9:15 pm, 45 minute before closing, The kitchen was extremely slow. I almost want to leave when the steamed buns and pear just took forever to be ready.  Might be back again for other items. Hours of opening though was odd since they closes 10 pm daily, a little early for Chinese restaurants?  Waitstaff is super nice, really apologetic for the slowness of the kitchen and even let me yell at him a little."}
{"text":"3.5 Star  DaYaLi Beijing Roast Duck Restaurant is one of the largest chain of restaurant in Beijing China. This Markham's location is the first ever branch that opens overseas or in fact outside of China. Dayali not only famous for their Roasted Duck but others dishes from Beijing, Sichuan, Shandong, Cantonese and Huaiyang.  Trying to call for a reservation but apparently need to have more than 4 people to reserve. Oh, maybe I should get more people?  Arriving on a Saturday 5:30 pm for a really early dinner. And there was like 1 hour wait. Be patient.  Gold Medal Roast Duck ($38.88)  - Nicely presented on a warm that keep the crepes warm - The condiments are set up in little plates surrounding the warmer: green onion, cucumber, sauce, dried cranberries, fresh grapes, sea salt and 5 spices salt - Skin are super crispy and thinly sliced, like eating chips! But with a mouthful of goodness of duck fat when I crunched into that! -  The sliced duck meat is really lean and  nicely presented on a swan like plate, really buttery but a little different than the other duck I had. A little bland so that's the reason for the salt!  Golden Pear ($1.50 each) - I know I want that when I saw it on the website - These are NOT really pears with a sweet potato outer layer stuffed with red bean inside! - Not overly sweet and not oily..   Lotus Roots and Chestnut in Black Bean Spicy Sauce - Lack the spiciness and the texture of lotus and chestnut are really similar - Boring in taste, mouth feel and presentation  Fish with Sour Cabbage  - I was surprised at how simple but how good this is - The fish though not the best quality went well with the sour cabbage and some preserved chili!  Chicken Stew Mushroom Soup ($7.99) - Mushrooms..tons of mushrooms.. - Chicken..tons of chicken - ginger, chicken and mushroom soup according to my Yelp Friend has \"special\" health benefit?! I am taking notes...  Service is fast and efficient. Too efficient when they trying to clear the plates even before we finish!   Everything taste good and priced reasonably but the duck was a little letdown. And the Menu is huge!! It will take me multiple visits if I going to sample more items on the menu!  Get the membership card which is good for 3 years give your special member pricing in case you going to visit again!  I might be back again to Dayali but definitely not on a busy weekend for dinner!"}
{"text":"Tasted worse than it was before, which was so sad. The signature Peking duck was expensive and not enough portion any more."}
{"text":"DaYaLi Beijing Roast Duck Restaurant's roasted duck is mostly likely as close as you can get in Toronto! This is not your typical pseudo deep dried duck in roasted duck disguise! It is the real deal! The restaurant was packed during lunch. It is well worth $29.99 per set ($31.88 without VIP card)! Even my price sensitive tiger mom raves about DaYaLi Beijing RoastDuck Restaurant!  If you've never had real roasted duck before, I would urge you to try DaYaLi Beijing Roast Duck Restaurant! I am already planning my next visit! Nom nom nom!!  Appetizer: Chinese Broccoli Rabe with Edamame   It has a slight wasabi flavour. I would recommend this dish as an appetizer to kick start your meal!  Pickled Chili with Phoenix Claw This is not for those with a weak stomach or without an adventurous palate! We commonly refer to chicken feet as phoenix claw. Chicken feet just sounds unappetizing! It's all about positioning and marketing! Try if you dare!  Chicken Kidney Salad  Again, not for weak sauce! This was my favourite dish! Fried peanuts, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, cabbages, lettuces with marinated chicken kidneys in a braised five spice soy dressing.  Braised Tofu with Pork The tofu was so flavorful from the bold gelatinous five spice bean paste sauce!  Entree: Roasted Duck ($29.99) Roasted duck is a must at a restaurant specializing in roasted duck! Duh! Not ordering it would be as offensive as walking into steak house and ordering steam chicken or other blasphemous dish! A plate of crispy duck skin is served with a side of szechuan pepper salt and sugar for dipping.   Chinese style-pancake is served with duck, spring onion, cucumber and sweet bean sauce. You can assemble little arts and craft projects by wrapping the aforementioned together! This debunk the hard-working Asians ethnic stereotype...unlike diligent shawarma house owners, our chefs are too lazy to wrap it for you.    Pepper Salt Duck Bone In other words, this is the mastery of reuse, reduce, recycle. The restaurant re-purpose duck carcasses into pepper salt deliciousness! No complains here! :)   Be prepare for long line ups!"}
{"text":"Booked for 7pm on Saturday. Packed with people, had to wait a bit. Had Perking duck, BBQ, potato dish, salad, tofu crap roe soup, fried rice, beef with Chinese celery (no photo), Dayali signature pear dessert. Best was perking duck. Second best was fried rice and Dayali signature pear. The other dish are ok. BBQ was too salty for me. I was impressed that restaurants are full packed and many still waiting on the line to get a seat when I got out of there like 9ish. Overall I would come again to try other dishes. I wanted to try dim sum and pan fried pancake but next time :)"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant's menu. Everything is very new and atypical of Chinese cuisine, which I appreciate since most cuisines these days taste very similar. The ambiance of the restaurant is very refreshing and spacious; the menu consists of a myriad of duck and other dishes.   Definitely recommend their western style salad, mashed root vegetable with blueberry sauce, and their Peking duck! The spicy options are good too.  Although the food tastes good, I always have a sick stomach after the meal... Something about be oiliness of the dishes makes me feel ill."}
{"text":"Garbage- service was poor, quality of food was decent. If their peking duck is the staple, it's not worth it. This place doesn't even deserve 1 star"}
{"text":"With the wave of immigration from mainland China, there has been an influx of amazing northern Chinese food in Toronto.  All in all: Dayali is a fantastic place to get Peking Duck.  We ordered the Signature duck dish - the duck skin was crispy, the meat was juicy.  However, I have to say, they were a little stingy on some of the cucumbers and sprigs of spring onion, however the additions of spicy salt, deep fried noodles and dried cranberries were very unique.    The other dishes were also quite good.  We ordered a vermicelli in soup, and it was delicious.  There was a nice blend of flavours in the broth - some fish, some meat.  The stir fried celery with cashews was good - the celery was crunchy and mildly flavoured.  We ordered some stir fried beans in a hot pot, with some peppers that really packed a punch.  We also ordered some xiaolongbao, which were unfortunately, terrible.  The wrappers were dry and all the soup had leaked out of the dumplings ages ago.      Staff were brusque and efficient, but this is no different than any other busy Chinese restaurant.    And in terms of a wait, we arrived at 5:30PM on New Years Day, and waited maybe 15 minutes.  Not too shabby."}
{"text":"Duck is horrible!!! A little expensive, member card is not worth, I went there on a Tuesday so there is no waiting and service is good. Duck is definitely not worth that price and not the traditional Beijing duck!!"}
{"text":"ONLY DEBIT AND CASH. Good, that's out if the way.   3.5/5. Decent pricing, but pricier than what you'd expect from regular Chinese restaurants. I ordered the Mixed Salad, and Beef and peppers (I'm not sure what it was listed as on the actual menu), while my friend ordered housemade noodles and braised eggplants. Together, it came to a bit over $36 after taxes.   Service was quick to get food to us, and they didn't really ask us anything after they delivered it to us. Not atypical for a Chinese restaurant, so I didn't mind! Gives us more time to chat uninterrupted :) The mixed salad arrived first, and was unexpectedly very tasteful and fresh. The dressing was complimented perfectly with the scent and crunch of peanuts. I recommend this dish the most at Dayali.  My dish came after and it wasn't as good as I would have liked. The meat didn't taste very fresh. It was chewy...like hard rubbery chewy. The peppers were okay. It had A LOT of oil. My friend's noodles were decent and priced at an affordable price - just a note: they have bits of meat in the dish. The braised eggplants also had some meat in the dish. My friend is trying to be vegan, so she didn't expect this. If you're vegetarian or vegan, ask what's strictly non-meat first! We had a menu with pictures, but I guess the meat in the noodles was too small to be pictured clearly.   I wouldn't come back here besides to introduce people to the salad. The interior is very nice though. Comfy chairs and a good amount of table space."}
