{"text":"I have seen rats here not once when I was outside but twice. A friend was talking us into a late night bite until we witnessed a rat in the lobby... disgusting"}
{"text":"Decent shawarmas and falafels. Good prices.   I'm a big fan of the people working there. They are very friendly.   As for atmosphere, it has a takeout or pizza-joint kind of vibe. It is clean, but no kind of fancy (which is totally fine). They have a nice HD TV to watch while you wait. It's pretty much always on the news when I go for lunch.   I love that this place brings a little cuisine variety to the neighborhood lunch scene. I just wish it tasted a little more awesome."}
{"text":"Great late night food options - but it is a tad on the pricey side compared to other spots on the street.  A Shawarma or Falafel combo (w/ fries and drink) will cost you around $10, but it is quite a lot of food.  You definitely won't go to bed hungry.    The staff is very friendly, and the service is quick.  Just like most places, this line can get very long as the bars close - so be prepared to wait.  The establishment is rather large with many tables, and serves as a great spot to spend some time after a fun evening dancing your tush off down at Dive Bar."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and beer selection. Had the sauerkraut balls, very tasty! Would visit again when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Middle of the road food.  It is absolutely a 3 star, nothing more, nothing less.  Gyros are tasty but a little messy. The gyro meat was cooked on a rotisserie, but cut off and stored till you order food. Probably a product of not having high traffic.  Prices are high, but you typically get a gyro combo for lunch for less than it shows on their menu???"}
