{"text":"We really enjoy this place. It's more of a restaurant where you can dine and have a conversation as opposed to its related counterpart, 416 Snack Bar, which is our go-to spot for late-night comfort tapas, cocktails, and extremely loud hip hop music.  This place is casual, dimly lit, with a good ambiance. We've only been on a weekday night and it's always been perfectly occupied (busy enough to be happening but not too busy to wait to be seated). We haven't been on a weekend and a reservation may be needed then.  The plates are not for the less adventurous eaters and are meant for sharing - each dish seemed ideal for 2 people. Our favourite was the Tagliatelle with crispy tongue and chanterelles. We loved the latkes with trout. We also liked the butter lamb croquettes.  I would highly recommend this place for a date or for 4 people. It looks like there's a table at the front that seats 6 or 8 people. We'll be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some small but phenomenal dishes and chill out evening with excellent cocktails then People's Eatery is the place for you! I have to rave some more about the cocktails! Extremely creative and delicious!"}
{"text":"cool vibe - good food, really enjoyed the atmosphere.  Would def. recommend."}
{"text":"We ordered pretty much as per Yelp's recommendations - General Tso Fu, Potato Latkes, and Peking Duck. They were delicious. The GTF tasted like Agedashi Tofu but with  a Chinese glaze. The smoked fish potato latkes tasted like something from Karelia. Peking duck was served 3 ways. First consummate in a cup, then roasted duck with generous portion, and then fried rice. Great service as well.   Love the Cantonese lessons in the washroom \"a la Macaroni Grill\". And the instructors were bantering each other, and the conversations were monotonus and hilarious! Definitely worth checking it out!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on Saturday, she had been before and really liked it.  The 2 stars comes from the fact that the value for money was really poor. The portion sizes were tiny. We order 2 apps (the latkes and the quail), 1 plate (scallops), and the smoked fish platter. The server said it would be enough food, yet after the meal, we were both still hungry, and we are not big people. For a $90 meal, you should NOT leave hungry. (We each had a drink too).   In particular the scallops plate was crazy small for $14 - more like an appetizer, and even then it would be considered small. Literally 2 scallops and 3 pieces of veggies. And the scallops were thin too, it almost seemed like 1 scallop sliced in half. The \"veggies\" were 1 piece of radish and 2 other pieces of veggies. Everything was bite sized. Although the presentation was beautiful, this dish felt like a complete rip off. I have dined at some really nice places all over the world, and unless you are a Michelin restaurant you shouldn't be able to get away with this.   As for the positives, the atmosphere was great and so were the drinks. And the food itself was fine, the latkes in particular were quite good. The service was fine too, but nothing to rave about.   If you are looking for a nice atmosphere and unique food and drinks, sure. If you are looking for a great meal, then there are better options for your money."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent cocktails!! Very unique dishes, and thoughtful drink ingredients. Staff are excellent at helpful with all choices. What a gem on Spadina!!"}
{"text":"I was here on a Saturday night with a group of around 10 people.  The actual place is very small and does not accommodate large groups very well.  If you do plan to go,  don't go with more than 4 people.   The beer selection is decent.  I wish the food and service was the same.  Right off the bat the waitress said that everyone will receive food at different times depending on what you order.  Initially we thought that would be a 20-30 minute difference max.  Some of the group got their entrée about an hour or so after myself and other finished.  It was that fucking bad.   The portion size is pretty small as well,  but you'd think you'd get more for the price you're paying.  A lot of people got the duck entrée,  reviews make it seem like a popular choice, but  shit was bland yo.  I can't believe it took them that long to make bad food.   The waitress wasn't very helpful and was pretty much never around.  Even though we were sitting right next to the kitchen.  Don't do this to yourself people.  You could throw a rock and hit a better restaurant then this place."}
{"text":"Come for the latkes, stay for the latkes. I love this place.  Friendly and delicious.  Great place to take a date!"}
{"text":"Best meal ever with exquisite food, fabulous service and comfortable surroundings. The tasting menu is a delight from start to finish with great balance of flavour texture and color in each course. I loved the salad nicoise and soon tofu but most of all the amazing arrancini. The owners were attentive and accommodated our preferences and it was a very memorable experience. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this spot. The food was fantastic, the music was spot on, and the drinks were great. Will definitely visit again next time I am in Toronto!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really cozy and intimate--this is a great place for a quiet dinner or a special date.  The food is billed as small plates, but the portions are perfectly sized for a single diner (so nice to be served exactly as much as I want to eat!)  The staff was accommodating when we added an extra person to our reservation, but they did mess up the bill and we had to flag them down to have them correct it.  The menu is small, but I understand it changes regularly, so it would be interesting to visit in a few weeks and see what they're serving."}
{"text":"I ate here for a small party for a friend. The food was delicious, they even accommodated me with a wide variety of vegetarian options. Drinks were awesome and so was the service. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"3.5/5. Came here based on a friend's recommendation but I wasn't overly impressed. The concept of fusion dishes was cool and the presentation of the dishes was nice but I did not Peking Duck (3 ways) was exceptional. I recommend the Hwe Dup Bap, thai Salad and fried tounge sandwich. I would avoid the Miso scallop if you are in a group (individually sized / overpriced)."}
{"text":"One of my best friends was recently celebrating an important milestone and they decided to go to People's Eatery. It is definitely very hipster, which is fine with me as I frequent and enjoy a number of places on Ossington, even if I don't fit the bill. This place takes hipsterism to a whole new level of arrogance.   It wasn't that busy that midweek night. Our table was certainly the largest in the place. There was no mistaking that we were celebrating a special occasion because my friends had brought balloons. Throughout the night, the guest of honour's drink kept on running out and we waited so long for the waiter to come around again that we went up to the bar on a number of occasions hoping for faster service. Nope. With three staff behind the bar, one on the computer, one polishing glasses and one obsessing over an espresso, all making eye contact with us but not acknowledging our presence, we waited... and waited. Eventually, I had a few words with the bartender and his face told me that he took great offense to me asking for slightly prompter service. He grudgingly poured our mixed drinks and inexplicably delayed our round of shots.   My friend is a chef at a top 20 Zagat rated Toronto restaurant in its cuisine. When I eat with him, I take his advice. That night we ordered oysters for our table of 10+ guests. He took one sniff of the oysters and didn't eat one. Some other people had some but I didn't join them. The wait staff didn't even notice the majority of them went back and charged for them nonetheless.   If you enjoy high-priced, mediocre food and drinks served at a pace that is convenient for the staff, this is your place. Or, if you know the secret hipster handshake, you may get better treatment."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to coming here and was a bit underwhelmed. Service and drinks were good, but food was just ok. We were also seated in what felt like the hallway and had to constantly lean to the side when people walked by, which was frequently. Glad that I tried it, but likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Was in a group of 12 guys. I didn't organize, but it sounded like they were generally accommodating. Table wasn't ready at the time of the reso but not a big deal, 15 min wait. I was late anyway :)   They brought us all their best dishes.   - Peking duck pancakes (3/5), but I'm spoiled having lived in Beijing - general Tao tofu (5/5), 12 guys ordered extra portions of this. If this is the case for tofu you know it's good - smoked fish (4/5), pretty fresh and the bagel bites were delicious   I don't recall the other dishes, but overall good service good food good ambiance. 4/5"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, welcoming atmosphere and delicious food! Will definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"My first time here & I loved it!!  The food was delicious & the service was great!   It is a tapas/ sharing food style. They're small portions so I recommend that you order a few and try out different ones! I recommend the watermelon salad and the BBQ quail. They're mouth watering delicious!  They also have a variety of drinks so this is definitely a good place to grab some drinks."}
{"text":"Have been here on multiple occasions and always have a great time. Dimly lit, sexy space with a great vibe and even better tunes.  What I've eaten: The peking duck 3 ways. Tasty stuff and a fair amount of food for the price. Comes with lettuce and tortillas, rice, a nice sauce, asian pear, and some crispy noodles for texture.   The potato latkes. Oh man. Can't rave enough about these. Crispy, salty goodness topped with trout, sour cream and roe. Unfortunately only comes with 2 per order. I could eat 20.  Tongue sandwich on a pretzel bun. Im a sucker for tongue so this went down well. Love the pretzel bun. Don't think it tops the Black Hoofs tongue on brioche but still a worthy opponent.   What I drank: A bit of everything. Nice wine and beer selection and although the cocktail list itself is small, the awesome bartenders there can whip up anything. Just tell them what you like!  Needless to say, Ill be back. Still have to book that tasting menu! (And eat my weight in latkes...)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite new places!   The place is super cool. Great energy and vibe! Service is always amazing. I've tried almost everything on this menu and was pleased!  Recomendations: potato latkes, fried tongue sandwhich, watermelon salad and the smoked fish platter!! Sooooo tasty!   Drinks are really really good as well! Bartenders are super freindly and the service is amazing. Sit at the bar!!!"}
{"text":"great fusion food. right on spadina reflecting the heritage of the area and modern day. flavorful beautiful dishes in a friendly comfortable atmosphere. sat at the corner of the bar and watched the slicing dicing and artistry of the dishes being prepared. magical!"}
{"text":"My partner and I enjoyed a great dinner at Peoples Eatery. Our service was fantastic - every single recommendation our server gave was spot on from wine, to starters to the duck platter.   Our favourites included:  - butter chicken lamb croquets - kibbeh - crispy pork - this might be sacrilege but my favourite part of the duck platter was the duck fried rice - scrumptious.  A long time fan of Chef Dustin Gallagher - I noticed that they even have a steak frites on the menu - could this be the famous one formally of Grace?! I think so. Tip - best steak I've ever had, now I know where to get it.  Also worth noting - great music! Loved the atmosphere. Its fun and refined without being stuffy and pretentious."}
{"text":"I am impressed. And I am Chinese. I am not usually impressed with overly trendy spots but I know good food when I taste it and combined with the funky decor, it somehow works. Not to mention the good drinks. I was told that the drinks weren't anything to write home about but I have to disagree. I think it was the best Dark & Stormy I've had in the city. And I had about 5 different ones that week.  Everything was a gourmet twist on Chinese food and dim sum. The tongue sandwich was so tasty that we had to order more. The twist on Peking Duck worked for us - everything from the five spice to the sauce to the Asian pear. I was sure that I wasn't going to like the fish platter because I come from a city with probably the best sashimi in North America, but I really enjoyed the different flavours. Loved the seared mackerel.   Definitely bring a group and order everything!"}
{"text":"People's eatery is one of those cool non Chinese restos  popping up on Spadina Avenue  Came here for lunch on a Tuesday and was pleasantly surprise that they have a very affordable lunch special. $15 for soup + sandwich +salad. I was not a fan of the matzo ball soup. I found it to be too salty for my taste.  I did however really enjoy the chopped kale salad and  the roasted beef  sandwich that was served in a pretzel bun. I like that they have their windows and doors wide open during the summer as It gives the illusion of eating at a patio. The staff is nice and friendly.  Overall solid spot if you are looking for something other than Chinese in Chinatown."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed by People's Eatery and I have been there A LOT!!!   The staple Tso Fu is worth writing home about/telling friends about and I get it everytime.   The Lamb Croquettes are so flavourful.   I tried the Peking Duk order last night for the first time and was blown away - the platter itself comes with a small appetizer soup that was ridiculously good.   Suffice to say, I will be returning time and time again."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends after a concert.  The decor is nice, cozy and the staff are lovely and quick to tend to you.  Our friend had a coupon for a \"free snack\" Our free snack was the latkos which are little cakes with trout to top. They were delicious!    We ordered a few more things off the menu including cow tongue sandwiches -with a pretzel bun and delicious mustard. I have never had tongue before and was slightly skeptical but would eat it again and again after this! So good.   I had the chardonnay which was so lovely and buttery.   We also had the sweet bun which was okay but I would definitely take the tongue sandwich over it.   There was a great vibe here that felt really chill even though the food was amazing. Not too often you find the best of both worlds. Chill atmosphere+amazing food. Win for me!"}
{"text":"I do indeed hope the excellent people at People's Eatery see this.   1. The place is beautiful, much of the food I have eaten has been delicious and interesting, fun, and the concept is wonderful. (Though they do not quite have Torrisi chops yet...)  2. The fish platter is a conceptual failure. Let me explain:  --a main delight of appetizing is the sheer abundance of the fish. The fact that the lox piles, in luscious glistening folds on a bagel, and overflows the sides is part of the point. The small slices (no matter how good) that are served here miss out on this essential feature. (This can be solved by accepting that ingredient cost is not always infinitely malleable and serving much larger pieces of fish and offering only a $45 platter...or more...charge more, but make it like I'm at a friend's apartment on the LES).   --Possible counterargument: We aren't doing Russ and Daughters...this is more like a sashimi platter. It is meant to be a delicate and focused experience.   --Rebuttal to this counterargument: Then why are you serving it with cream cheese and pickled onions and horseradish? Either we are having a precise and uncluttered experience, or we are having a celebratory oily fishstravaganza. You guys are mixing them in the wrong proportions. If you think I'm wrong....fine: de gustibus non disputandum. But please at least offer yourselves the chance for a rethink. Your spot is so damn good. I want you to kill it. But the problem I have outlined above is not get-overable in my mind.   tl;dr You could drop (or re-work) the fish platters and you would have an even better restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is honestly insane. In a good way. I used to live right on Spadina and this was my favourite spot for drinks, bites, dates, catch ups, you name it. It's been a little bit but I still go whenever I have an excuse, and here's why.   Food. So good. So many things that I love to order. It's great to start off with some crispy latkes with smoked salmon and creme fraiche. The tofu cubes are similarly lovely and easy to share. I've also enjoyed the watermelon + feta salad sticks. If you are really tucking into a meal, the smoked fishes platter and/or the duck platters are wonderful. Totally different from each other, yet playing together so beautifully. The smoked fish is like a suped-up bagel platter with the fanciest house-made, house-smoked fishes and accoutrements. The duck platter holds the most delicious lettuce wraps, but also a little soup to start and again, INSANE fried rice packed with edamame. I also enjoy the lamb croquettes with a butter-chicken-like sauce? Not calling it the right thing, but you'll know it when you see it.   Service. Always on top of it. Sweet people. You'll be taken care of but left enough to your own devices, so it's perfect for deeeeeeep talks.   Vibe. Always hopping! Seriously, there are always some humans having  good time here, even right when they open. It's truly a spot for any time."}
{"text":"good food. Fusion chinese based. Owners are amazing, dj and chef are top. Lamb with curry, corean salade are my fav."}
{"text":"The menu has something for everyone. There are nods to some of the great cultures/cuisines of Toronto.  Although the plates are made for sharing, you will not leave hungry.  The Korean salad (although I wish it had more fish) was delicious and definitely a must."}
{"text":"Great fusion cuisine. Each dish was a delight. Service amazing. Had no reservation but it wasn't the usual we need the table by...they were polite! Sat upstairs would prefer downstairs, oh and great cocktails.   We've been to this restaurant probably five times. The food is consistently amazing and the wait staff a close second. Highly recommended. Only downside is a limited white wine selection."}
{"text":"Relaxed but professional service and great atmosphere. The tasting menu was fantastic and the wine pairings were spot on.  Honourable mention goes to the carpaccio which was amazing and the duck confit.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"big healthy salad\" through Uber eats. It came to about $15 after tax and delivery. The food didn't look ANYTHING like the picture. The picture showed a big heaping bowl of greens, and what I got was a tiny takeout paper box with soggy wet kale."}
{"text":"An awesome addition to Chinatown.  If you want evidence that the Spadina is evolving, People's Eatery is proof served on a silver plater. This hip bar is unlike most of the restaurants that it calls neighbour.  Came here on the weekend and they had a DJ playing. The place was packed and it's obvious why. The food was amazing. I tried the Thai chicken wings for $7. Got about 5-6 pieces of chicken. Each dish is meant to be shared with the table just like a traditional Chinese meal. Cocktails were also delicious and ran in at about $10 a drink. They also give lucky Chinese candy in lieu of mint candy when you get the bill at the end which is a nice touch.  The decor and atmosphere was a pleasant surprise. Great to hang out with friends or for a date. Music was on point and the real taper candles at each table was a nice touch.  The one knock against them was the slow service as it took awhile to get my drink (ordered food and drinks at the same time and the drink came just after the food). They are really nice though so it makes up for the speed.  As you leave the People's Eatery at night, you step out back on to the quiet night street of Spadina and leave the music behind."}
{"text":"First time coming here for an after-work meet-up (highly recommended by a colleague).  Interior is a bit dark, suitable for the dinner mood.  Restaurant is literally located in Chinatown, but without a big sign (so just be a little alert when finding it).    Great service - waiters were very attentive (making sure we have water, asking us if we need help on drinks/menu) and checking on us regularly to make sure we are okay.  Food overall was good - a bit on the pricer end.  Most of the food is Fusion style with a mix on Asian based concepts dishes. Portions are meant to be for sharing - perfect if you want to try a variety of things.  I can't recall all the dishes I ate - but some of the memorable ones include: * Butter lamb croquette - the chutney really adds a nice flavor to the croquette, without overpowering the lamb taste.  And it's not too fried/oily.  Smoked fish appetizer - fish were fresh.  Waiter was informative on explaining what they were.  And it's eaten like a build your own taco style - so can't go wrong on what you put in your selection  Peking duck - you drink a small hot soup before this is serve (kinda cleans the palette).  Served with traditional sesame pancakes and fused with romaine wraps.  Duck was nicely done and eating it both styles were very suitable.  Overall I enjoyed my first time coming here - would definitely come back (maybe in the summer) to try their tasting menu."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. We went for the October 2014 tasting menu upstairs. One word: amazing. Two words: perfect pairings. The dishes were a festive mingling of flavours across the spectrum of taste that flowed together naturally. Wait staff were friendly and very knowledgable. I've been raving about the meal and recommending it to friends ever since.   First course was a Sicilian salad paired with vermut negro - lovely pairing. I've been getting into bitters lately so this was a nice new taste for me. The salad was a beautiful balance of salty and sweet flavours, soft and crunchy textures.  Vermut bitter was a real extension of the dish.   Second was miso scallop and Chardonnay. Presentation was fun - over a single serving hibachi (I'm sure there is another name for this but I don't know what it is). Scallop, radish, eggplant. One piece of each. All very complimentary along with the dry sweetness if the Chardonnay.   Third course was corn bibimbap. Pairing was a wheat beer. Another fun dish! My first time trying this traditional Korean dish. The bowl exploded with flavour and was velvety soft and warm. Comfort food for a cold day.   Fourth was veal brisket and a gigondas. This dish was so rich and hearty. The brisket fell apart easily with the touch of my fork and melted slowly in my mouth. A light sauce accompanies the dish as well as a rich and creamy pave potato. And I've never met a gigondas I didn't like and especially one paired with slow cooked meat.   Dessert was a sweet meillefeille coupled with a mixed cider and gingerbeer. A crisp finish to a decadent meal.   My favourite meals stick in my head forever and this meal is one more do those; very memorable. We'll be back monthly to try everything this team of people puts together. Bravo!"}
{"text":"So my whole fam jam came here two weeks ago prompting me to do a re review, this time with less snark about a shitty barman. My aunt really likes it here and decided we should try it with the family. We got a bunch of dishes, the benefits of big group and small plates and I an now give an honest review of the food and the service  Service: super quick and they kept folding my napkin when it fell on the ground, kinda disconcerting (one star)   Food: latkes were meh and the tofu was super salty but the duck and the chefs take on El pastor was amazing. I didn't get a chance to try the liver cause my mom and aunt ended that pretty quick. (two star)   Funny story: so my mom is a big top chef fan and very much flagged down Dusty the chef to make awkward conversation with him. Well done to him for putting on a smile and making Mom's day. Plus one star."}
{"text":"I came to the Peoples Eatery on a recent Tuesday on the recommendation of a friend. I'd be happy to take their advice again.  It doesn't fit the area particularly well, but that is a compliment to the Peoples Eatery, not Chinatown.   We only popped in for a quick drink but were soon persuaded to sample the snack menu. There was a lot of great smelling food at the tables around us! I tried the steak tartar and a couple of my friends had the sashimi salad, both were very nice and reasonably priced.  I'd love to come back and try out their full tasting menu in the near future.  Quick Edit: This could easily be higher than three stars overall, but I would need to sample the full restaurant to give a full review."}
{"text":"An evening of good beats and vibes, inexplicably tainted by a passive aggressive female server (pale skin, long brown hair) who tragically thinks service is her job. Apparently, the People's Eatery is a throwback to the Eastern Bloc, where the gatekeeper of provisions will mete out starvation and slow service as a punishment to anyone who dares ask for a menu of the unlisted things that is being describing too fast and unappetizingly.  \"Syrup with ice\"? Ergh.  It is possible to get a 4.5% watery Chinese $5 bottle beer, or $13 cocktails.  Bar skills looked promising, food looked great (as we were seated in front of a cook preparing salmon croquette with lots of care).  But sadly, the service prevented us from finding out.  Good thing we had friends there with some provisions, and were willing to mitigate the hunger and thirst by sharing."}
{"text":"Loving the Spadina history and culture concept. Nice restaurant layout. Slightly pricey, but *delicious* bites. Enjoyed a pleasant local cider (Waupoos) and then kept it in the mishpocha by sharing the whitefish salad bagel toast with wasabi tobiko, fried tongue sandwich on pretzel bun with pickles & mustard and latkes with pastrami-cured trout, sour cream and salmon roe. Didn't enjoy the rushed service even though I understand that they're \"new and hot\"."}
{"text":"This unassuming restaurant with literally no sign finds its home in Chinatown, surrounded by traditional chinese restaurants and bubble tea cafes. I ordered the general tso-fu, BTC, and pork belly, along with a tokyo sour cocktail on the side. Sadly, I had higher expectations since I read the yelp reviews prior to visiting. While the general tso-fu tasted good, it was extremely salty and over seasoned. I was gulping down water after the first bite. My favorite dish was the BTC, I have a thing for \"rare\" meats, and this did not disappoint! The flavors intricately danced on my taste buds and I would of ordered seconds had it not been so pricey! The main reason I give this restaurant 3 stars is because the dishes are quite small, even the entrees in proportion with the price. Its hard to get \"full\" here even after ordering 3 dishes. Last but not least, the pork belly wasn't as I imagined. It was bland and I wish I did not order it. The tokyo sour was very unique, who would of thought to put egg white in an alcoholic drink? Service and ambiance was super romantic, and if you have money to spare this is a nice place to bring a date!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the food, but very much on the loud side--tough to talk. Super service, even at the bar, with solid wine suggestions from bottles not on the by-the-glass list. Would go back in an instand."}
{"text":"Great take on peking duck, very filling.  Whitefish dish was great too.  Pictures speak for themselves.  Great for dinner, late night snack."}
{"text":"By far the best restaurant I dined at in my visit to Toronto. Let's start with the drinks - Sade knew exactly what she was going,  she definitely put an artistic spin on each cocktail. The food was AMAZING! The lamb croquettes are a must,  the Moroccan eggplant will transform your palate and the pecking duck was perfectly cooked! For dessert we had the bread pudding-like with toffee and sour cream topping. Whoa! My husband were talking about it for days! A must for anyone visiting our who lives in Toronto and has never been!"}
{"text":"1 of my new fave restaurants. The food is amazing!  Very cool vibe, and it's a great spot for late night food"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place so many times and finally made a pop in on Saturday night for some drinks.   Started with one of their cocktails that sounded nice. Unfortunately it was a little more bitter than I was hoping for so I made the conversion back to the oh-so-reliable wine. Their wine list (by the glass) isn't overly extensive. I think they had about 4 options for each colour. However, I was content with my choice.   Of course this place is known for their general tso tofu so after a few drinks, I couldn't resist. Deeeeeffffinitely worth trying! Mind you, I could do general tso anything!!   Really cute spot and service was top notch at the bar. Note: this is a smaller joint but really cool/chill vibe."}
{"text":"cold food, Bad service. Maybe it was an off night and the workers werent focused on making our experience memorable. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"Food was AMAZING!! Wow wow wow. However, service was slow but friendly,"}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance, especially the beats. Only had oysters and some ginger drink - lots of ice. Will be back for a proper dinner."}
{"text":"This place is pretty small, and the portions are small as well. Came here on a Saturday night, but ended up at the bar - so remember to make your reservations! Got the peking duck for two, and while it's not the real-deal peking duck, it came pretty damn close. Too many peas in the stir fry for me, but overall it was pretty good. Recommend getting one more dish (not from the appetizer menu), since the portions aren't that big if you're hungry. But the ambience is cute, and I'd definitely recommend coming here if you're not sure where to go for dinner on a Saturday night!"}
{"text":"We wandered into this place by asking The Food Gods where we should eat after our touristicalness of the Hockey Hall of Fame. The Food Gods steered us right. Tucked away in a row of unremarkable eateries is this remarkable gem. As a Fat American Tourist I know a thing or thirty-seven about eating.  It's small. We sat at the bar with chef Dustin and Alex who was working the following night and was in the apprenticeship phase. Alex looks Sidney Crosby's twin brother. Alex if you get low on cash and scruples you could make a small mint hawking autographs in Pittsburgh.  Fun beverage menu. Good bartender. Food was a delight. The watermelon salad was refreshing, the tongue sandwich was tender and chock full of flavor. Get the Peking Duck platter. Be prepared to argue over who gets to hog the rice and duck confit. Then realize the portion is generous enough for three. Fun, good, excellent value. If the wife hadn't been in a hurry to get back to the hotel and sleep I'd have stayed and drank/ate my way through the menu."}
{"text":"For Chinatown? This is so not Chinatown! It's the smallest restaurant/bar filled with the biggest flavors and truly unique dishes. Try the chanterelle toast and the HBD salad. Definitely my faves of the night. The Peking duck was good but not great...I think the duck fried rice and the duck consommé are the star side dishes of that plate to be honest. But seriously, come here and eat their food. Such a unique twist on Asian cuisine!"}
{"text":"I love this spot. Great food and drinks, and a great atmosphere for hanging out with some friends."}
{"text":"It's definitely one of the 'quieter' bars downtown. It does get pretty packed but it still feels intimate + everyone is very friendly and helpful. The Crispy Thai Pork is really yummy and so are the Potato Latkes. It's one of my go to places for dates, hanging out, just chilling in general. The drinks are good too!"}
{"text":"Seems like there are a lot of Chinese fusion restaurants recently ever since the chef that opened R&D won MasterChef Canada, but so far my experience with Chinese fusion restaurant had been disappointing.  Peoples Eatery was not an exception either.  I came here on a weekday with three other friends, my friend was able to book a table of 4 and they were kind enough to sit us at a room.  The overall decor is nice and very hipster, same with the room we were in, but this place has like no AC and ZERO ventilation. Sweating like a pig during dining is not the best experience.  Let's talk about their food, we ordered the General Tso Fu, Deli Whitefish Salad, Asparagus, Masu Donburi and the BBQ Beef Short Ribs. Portion is super small and they expect you to order a lot of items to share with a group, I'm okay with this tapas style approach as long as the price is reasonable.  When your $22 dish is also relatively small, we have a problem.  Food tasted mediocre and I can't see where the fusion is in each dish, maybe because they used one Asian ingredient per dish? I think out of the dishes we ordered, we were impressed with the Deli Whitefish Salad. Great use of wasabi tobiko on bagel toasts.  Overall 2 stars, super humid restaurant with overpriced food and mediocre tastes."}
{"text":"This is a real hidden gem, I eat out 4-7 times a week all over Toronto and states and really loved the easy going hipster vibes and good food!"}
{"text":"Great place! I love the music (old school hip-hop) and the atmosphere. I tried the peking duck, which was fantastic to share with friends. 9/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Bloody amazing food! Everything we ate was fantastic. Told the staff how much we enjoyed it and was introduced to the owner Adrian who gave us a tour of the facilities. The upstairs has a prix fixe menu complete with wine pairings. Can't wait to try that. In the meantime I've told all my pals This is the new go to place."}
{"text":"Woww small place but amazing food!!! The duck, pork, salad, everything was just so good!!!"}
{"text":"Service was okay. Food was good but tiny portions."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for a Friday night using tab. We decided to try the July 2015 tasting menu for $65 per person (for those who want wine pairings as well, it is an additional $35).  Food - All the dishes were fantastic. Some stand outs from this tasting menu include the liver pate, the tuna sashimi and the dessert was amazing (a strawberry shortcake with compressed strawberries). Although each dish was tasty, I was surprised by the lack of Asian influence in the dishes for this tasting menu. Despite the higher prices, I feel that the quality of the tasting menu is worth the higher price.  Service - Great. Our waitress brought over extras for us to try during our dessert, including a dessert rose wine. I thought that was a nice touch to end the tasting menu.  Ambience - We were seated on the second floor, which feels less lively compared to the first floor. I would recommend asking to be seated on the main floor if you want more of the trendy/lively atmosphere, especially on weekends.  I will definitely be coming back to People's Eatery."}
{"text":"Food was decent, definitely not worth the hype and whopping prices.  We heard so many good things about People's Eatery online so I finally decided to check it out with some friends last night. I was expecting to be wow'd at this Chinese-Jewish fusion restaurant but was disappointed with both my expectations of the food, portion sizes, and the prices. We ordered a few things off the menu including the following dishes:  Smoked fish platter - $55 for 4 - they give you the equivalent of approximately 100 grams of fish with a roll of cream cheese and some bagel chips. So not worth it. Sad assortment of pickled cucumbers, 4 large capers, some pickled beets and onions & dollop of horseradish. We were in shock when it came out as my friend kept repeating how robbed he felt at what was in front of us. \"For $55, I can get a decent steak and this is what they bring out?\" Just go to Schmaltz Appetizing and get a bagel for $15 with the equivalence of what you get here.   Black bean sea bass - The look of disappointment that was on our faces when this dish came out should have been caught on camera. My response when the waiter brought it out was \"that's it?\" To which he responds by \"it's 2 filets!\" My friends all chimed in with \"that's the size of a micro-penis\" \"is it a filet for ants?\" \"Did we order from the children's menu?\" The flavour wasn't anything special and didn't do justice to the fish.  Tongue sandwich - We were all excited to try the tongue sandwich and we weren't disappointed by this dish, it was tender, flavourful, paired with pickles and horseradish mayo put together on a pretzel bun. For $7, I would expect something a bit bigger but was again disappointed by the size. It was equivalent to a slider.  We also ordered the BTC salad which was tasty and an interesting take on beef carpaccio, yet left me unsatisfied. Again the $16 price point is completely unjustified.   After several other dishes, we left hungry and unsatisfied. My experience at People's Eatery is equivalent to dating a guy and discovering he has a tiny penis. No matter how great he is, he will never satisfy my needs.   Our last thoughts as we paid a $229 bill was \"Should we order a pizza to the restaurant?\""}
{"text":"Awesome place to go to when u just want to have a couple of glass of wine or beer and snack on awesome flavour filled food.  It's a hip chilled place with awesome music just to lounge on and have a good time.  It is a bit pricey...well it's a tapas kind of place so it might be cheap looking at the menu but it comes in smaller amount and can add up.  So just keep in mind to go to a good Chinese restaurant for dinner first if ur not willing to spend big bucks for drinks and snacks."}
{"text":"I came with my friends to celebrate one of our friend's birthday and she's craving for Peking Duck so we thought we give the place a try. It's located at the heart of Chinatown and it's a fusion Chinese cuisine overall. We were really impressed on how everything they served and it's a good, cozy, unique experiences overall. Good wise taste amazing but again we're paying for the experience, in my opinion. Would recommend to everyone else to try it!"}
{"text":"Smack dab in the middle of Chinatown is this place. Offering twists, fusions and concoctions borrowing from all the local cultures. Kinda ballsy in chinatown, don't ya think? It absolutely works though. :)  I had seen this place so many times and heard good things about it. So when the opportunity came up to try this place and I jumped at the chance.  I was impressed from the get go. Customer service was incredible not just from the servers but from anyone that worked the space including the owner. Nothing felt contrived or forced which  was pretty cool. They seemed to genuinely enjoy being there.   On to the food. Portions are absolutely meant to be shared. You won't be full by ordering 2 dishes. Go with friends and try at least 4.  When went with recommendations that didn't steer us astray.    We had the general tso fu - a sticky, crunchy deliciousness! Highly recommend! The butter lamb croquettes were such a wonderful bite - I wanted to eat everyone elses share. The morroccan eggplant was incredible. Try it with every element its presented with - you won't regret it.  The crispy thai pork was interesting because it successfully paired jackfruit with pork belly.  The star of the dishes was the duck. Tender and flavourful. Very well executed dish.  We finished with a customer favourite dessert - a sticky toffee pudding made with maple. This was heaven.  Drinks? Yes! I had the monk mule!Very nice balance of flavours. One of the first times that the ginger didn't take over the flavour!  Would I return? Ohhhh, hell yes!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to Peoples Eatery. Both the food and the atmosphere were great. The Cornish Hen was absolutely amazing; it was juicy and flavourful, and it also came with a bunch of great sides.  I also recommend the General Tso Tofu; the tofu was deep fried to perfection and covered with a delicious mildly spicy sauce. The HDB, a Korean style sashimi salad, is a great starter for sharing as well.  Our waiter was very friendly, and he was always quick to refill our waters. Overall, this is a great place to check out in Chinatown!"}
{"text":"4 of us came for drinks and snacks at lucky red.. But they were closed for a private event.. So we went across the street to people's eatery. Very expensive for Chinatown. Drinks were about $10-13... And weren't that great. My gf got a drink that tasted like Chinese medicine on ice. The general tao tofu was good.. But not for that price point. Foie gras not bad. Eggplant very small. Sashimi salad was actually was very flavourful and refreshing. Overall, portions are tiny and taste was not on par for what I'm paying for. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Decent small plates and a stuffy-cool atmosphere make this a decent choice in an area devoid of much else in its category. The pork buns and watermelon are its best fare."}
{"text":"I am torn on my review of this place. The ambiance, service and food is excellent (4 star level). However, the portion sizes are sooooo small for the price (2 star level). It comes down to an opinion regarding value for money. If you are able to order without any consideration to price, you are bound for a excellent meal. If you don't like hemorrhage money on a meal, you are going to get a couple nice mouthfuls but plan for another meal nearby right after.  Came on a Saturday night for a double date and we ordered the curry lamb app, HDP salad, the sea bass and the pork belly. The curry lamb and the HDP salad was delicious, but only provided a mouthful of food each. Both the sea bass ($32) and pork belly ($20) were entree level, both were well executed with great flavor. The sea bass was lighter of the two but still fresh and well balanced. However, even at entree level, the dishes were small. I expect to be full after eating a $32 dish but I was still hungry afterwards. Expect to order a minimum of three to four dishes per person in order to have a complete meal.  We went nearby for crepes and icecream afterwards, or I would definitely have stopped for a second dinner so I wouldn't go to bed hungry."}
{"text":"OK, super cute ambiance but the food left more to be desired.  We ate: - Duck course (2/5): While the rice were awesome, the actual duck and lettuce wraps were mediocre. - Potato Latka (2/5): No texture, no memories - General tao tofu (3/5): Not bad - Sashimi salad (5/5): The only thing I would go back for  Probably will not be back :("}
{"text":"Such a good spot for a Friday night and here's why:   1. The atmosphere  The music here is fantastic if you're into drake, r&b, etc. It's such good vibes - peoples eatery reminds me of a hybrid of drake hotel and cactus club. If you're lucky, you can get a little private table facing their wine cellar on the first floor.   2. Great service  The staff here are on point. Every time I've come here, the staff have been great entertainers, helpful and given great recommendations. We even learned a few wine tips from our server once.   3. The FOOD Highly recommend:  -general tso fu -potato latkes  -oysters  All of the above are so so good. I'm allergic to soy but I'm willing to suffer for the general tso fu lol this is definitely a place you go to for light apps/snacks though  People's Eatery is kind of a hidden gem in Chinatown - highly recommend for a chill spot before you go out on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"one of my favorite spots.  servers are relaxed but attentive, food is usually spot on.  fish platter is gangbusters.  good beer wine cocktails.  food misses every once in a great while but overall experience is worthwhile"}
{"text":"A big fan of these guys, 416 Snack Bar is excellent, this isn't AS good but sticks to the same formula. Inventive small plates in a trendy setting with excellent cocktails from behind the bar. It's a little pricey for what it is but the food is good, the service pleasant and despite coming away feeling a little hungry the quality of the food makes up for it. It was very busy and a little cramped so make a reservation."}
{"text":"I fell down the stairs here in early June and fractured my tailbone. Poorly lit stairwell with no signage and slippery steps.  Food is mediocre (been here twice prior to the stair incident)"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service was slow. Not enough staff. Our waitress was also serving a group of 16 people and was too busy. Ambiance is relax but a little loud in the room upstairs. Wine was warm (room temperature). We asked to chill it, which she did.  Worth the group menu at 55$ (way enough food)."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 6 people a week prior for a Friday and the entire process was seamless.   Really great customer service from the waiter (wish I remembered his name) and the food was much better than I expected for a snack bar.   I prefer the overall food and vibe over 416 Snack Bar (I think they're the same owners?). Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"We only came here for drinks. It was recommended to us by a hip cool bartender from Cold Tea. The atmosphere is trendy but not presumptuous. Best of Q Tip was  album was playing. Just the right amount of chill vibe we were looking for. We didn't get anything to eat here. They get highest ratings for cocktails. This is on my list for one of the best cocktails spots. Blake, is a true mixologist, cocktail master/wizard, and just freakin dope. Just by asking you for your preferred drink or mood, he blended up liqueurs and made delicious potions not on the menu. Must try the pineapple rum drink (I only remember this drink bc its on the menu). But pretty much whatever he makes. Can't remember them but here are pictures. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Sounds like a place Dwayne \"the Rock\" Johnson may visit.  The people's champ may go to feast a variety of snack foods.  He may choose the delicious tso-fu which was the best thing I had on the menu. In fact General Tso-fu sounds like a great wrestling name who's finishing move might be the \"PETA pit\" or something like that.  The char shiu boa (pork bun) and oysters also deserves honorable mention.    The sabich and panipuri were average.  The pineapple with coconut creme and lime was a finishing move more like Hogan's lam leg drop as opposed to the electrifying people's elbow.    They have a nice beer selection  but none of the cocktails raised my eyebrow.  As for the staff, I found they had a Rock-like arrogance although not nearly as annoying as other places.  For example, after inquiring about beer choices off the menu I heard the bartender telling his co-worker about the great new beer they got which he didn't even mention to me. I could hear the voice of the rock in my head emphatically stating that \"It doesn't MATTER what beer you want!\"  I'm stuck between 3 and 4 but will go four since the food in general was good and I'm intrigued by the set menu and some of the other items on the menu.  I just hope next time they don't act like a bunch of Jabronis."}
{"text":"Trendy, delicious, friendly, and good location + great staff and music. at night it's a fun bar with a dj and good ambience! During the day it's a great place for a snack and a drink.   All in all, this place is a great place for a date! If it's a first date or a night out for a married couple, this place is good. It's not super cheap, but the dishes match the price. Delicious. Also it shows you aren't cheap a la mcdonalds ;) don't expect to fill up, but that's another reason I say it's good for a date. You won't be super stuffed and you can dance.   I can't wait for them to open the second floor.   This place is literally one of my favourite spots in Toronto and I would take tourists here (and have!). It also appeals to a broad demographic.   Why 5 stars? It's an open concept and you can see the kitchen. They even have a small food prep station at the bar. It's stylish and trendy. And the best reason is the staff. You'll feel welcome!"}
{"text":"You guys,   this restaurant is simply incred! Every bite was mmmmmmmmmmmmmm. The location is kind of random, but at least you can get your phone fixed 17 times at the neighboring cell phone repair stores."}
{"text":"Candlelight ambiance is nice...but like 416Snack Bar, this is just trendy and overpriced... and is just contributing to gentrifying China Town.   Food is tasty. The menu is purposefully all over the map. I get it. It reflects diversity of Toronto.   But then the dishes are so small, it's tough to share (which is the concept) and tough to have as one entree. In the end, the average person needs to order 4 dishes to feel full, but you're now left with having experienced various flavours, textures, cultures and fats... if you're over 35, you're probably going to have a stomach ache.    You can spend the same amount of money and eat at some very nice restaurants in the city with better food, service and atmosphere.   The value equation is just off."}
{"text":"Every single dish we tried was impeccable. Personal standouts were the lamb croquettes, miso glazed eggplant, tofu and duck confit rice. Their cocktails were fantastic and the service was incredible - 5 star experience all around!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that stands out for me?  How about the words LET DOWN! They pre set meal was lame, lacked flavours, variety and creativity. How many ways can you slice and pickle fish and make it interesting to your customers?!  We sat on the top floor so good luck getting a drink that didn't take more than 20 min. If you wanted to go to the washroom you need to leave bread crumbs behind you to find your way way back from the basement.  The only positive here was the one staff member who was left to serve our group of 12 , haul food up a \"hill\" and fetch drinks from down stairs.  Not my type of place. Skip what ever hype this place has and go to a place that can deliver satisfaction."}
{"text":"This place stands out on spadina, food is good, vibe is good, music is good. What else do you want? I tried the sabich, small little taco like sandwich but very tasty.  Try it next time ur around!"}
{"text":"Don't get the Peking duck. The non Asian foods are yummier here. The Peking duck was dry and no skin. It came with lettuce wraps and duck rice to wrap in the rice? But minimal duck to be honest.  The service was fine at the bar but the owner or manager was rude. He came over and I asked him 'what are we doing'. He said you're moving over one seat. I asked him why. And he said ' so that we can maximize our seating'. We were in the middle of eating the Peking duck wraps. I said we're in the middle of dinner. To which he replied why are you getting so upset, that that's how they always do it at 416 snack bar and here. I said I've been there and wasn't asked to move. He said well too bad.   I wish he would have asked us to move instead of telling us to. Its not a big deal after all.   But even so, don't get the Peking duck."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. The Peking duck some 3 ways was phenomenal. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Decent. Nice. Asian-Jewish fusion.  Best part: the 45 day aged Australian wagyu. Meat succulent, super tender and flavorful on the inside with a great tasting seat on top. Impressed by the accompanying tempura too. Well done.  Worst part: rancid mildew smell that soaked through the menus. Very off-putting.  Everything else: pretty decent, from the ambiance to the fried tongue sandwich, Peking duck, tofu, and whitefish salad dish.  Then why a meh review? Because our share for two came out to $127. I get that price shouldn't drive reviews, but at the same time, this was just a bridge too far."}
{"text":"Really slow service (I had to ask for a beer twice from 2 different servers and we had to wait 30 minutes for the bill, before putting on our coats and hunting for a server). On the plus side, the food was awesome, especially the peking duck, tofu, and steak tartare. Reasonable prices and great decor. I would go back again, but with the expectation of sloooooow service."}
{"text":"It was pretty good--very eclectic.  Peoples borrows from Chinese, Korean, Middle Eastern, Indian, Italian, Greek and Jewish as well as other cuisines.  Frankly for me I think it is harder to do a lot of things equally well.  Of our selections I particularly like the Peking Duck three ways the most.  I found the dishes to be a little small and pricey.  Maybe a nice date night or drinks and snacks before the show.  Not sure I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Given my love for 416 Snack Bar, why wouldn't I like this place?  My picks: 1. Butter lamb croquettes: hard to go wrong with lamb (usually) but these well-portioned cubes are done amazingly well with great accompanying sauces.  2. Jamaican braised beef: (yes i have a thing for red meat) 3. dessert: Pouding Chomeur (not sure if this was just a Winterlicious thing). This.Was.So.Good.I.Died....of.Joy. Warm and cold and sweet and moist all at the same time.   Structured like an old cozy house with different spaces. Good for groups.   a quirky aspect: the washrooms play language tapes instead of music. I've experienced how to learn Spanish, and another language I wasn't familiar with."}
{"text":"Wow, this part of town is sort of changing, sort of not. People's Eatery has a lot of things right, especially the service, but the food can still use some work. I tried the sauerkraut beer, which I thought was a perfect summery brew and followed it with a (pricey, $7) well shot of Bourbon.   The fact that this is the 416 Snack Bar folks tells me that the food will continue to evolve and improve but on my last trip there were probably as many misses as there were hits. It's still 4 stars though because in the neighborhood it is a total standout for getting drinks and chatting away a few hours."}
{"text":"My 500th review!  For my milestone review, I wanted to go to a good solid spot and be wow'd by flavours.  Checking yelp and the top 100 Canadian restaurants, Peoples Eatery seem like a good choice and it really was.  Drawing inspiration from across Asia, the menu is an homage to all of Asia ... taking classic dishes and then the kitchen changing them up with modern twists.  The service here was on point and a clear strength of the restaurant.  In the heart of Chinatown mayhem, Peoples eatery sticks out and yet fits in with it's surroundings.  A chic black minimalist entry gives way to a long bar and then a smaller modern dining area.  Wooden mosaics creates a warmth to the area and keeps it from being too sterile.  In most downtown restaurants, the bathroom is downstairs... just a warning to anyone average height or taller, the stairs down is a treacherous gauntlet and this is coming from a shorty.  One unfortunate drawback of having the great open window in the front... all the fruit flies from Chinatown's groceries make its way here eventually.    Service here stands out among its peers... not only was our server was attentive, warm, and really knowledgeable about the menu, we had two other servers in addition to the manager pop by our table to ask how the food is and see if anything else was needed.  I dont think I've had some many people interested in knowing how our experience was.  Service is definitely a 5 star.  General Tso Fu - Savoury and spicy crispy shells covering custardy smooth tofu.  This was an interesting take of the North American General Tso Chicken.  This was less sweet than most places and had a nice strong kick from the dried chillis.  It also had a bit of salty pungent hit from fermented black beans.  I really enjoyed this appetizer and recommend it!  I know black beans is usually very salty but if they could have taken it down a notch, it would be perfect.  This is the perfect way to breakdown any eye rolls you get from carnivores when you say tofu.  A must get!   4.5/5  Butter Lamb Croquettes - Another crunchy app but this time with a lot of tender shredded lamb encased in a crunchy batter.  The addition of the sweet chutney & yogurt is a nice compliment to the stronger curried lamb.  The lamb had a mild gamey flavour to let you know you're not just eating a plain old chicken.  A true carnivore would like this app.  A near perfect app... I enjoyed it and think it could have taken a bit more spice for curry. 4.5/5  HDB salad - An interesting and fun salad ... it comes with many ingredients where you mix tableside.  It had a lot of fun components that added the crunch... crunchy puffed rice, crispy lettuce, and more vegetables added to it.  The tobiko gave it a salty pop of flavour in every bite.  The trout and gojuchang were mild components and shouldnt scare anyone off from this 4/5  Peking Duck - I've eaten Peking Duck in some of the best restaurants in China which specializes in this.  I know this is not authentic and NOT meant to me... it's their homage and take on it.  Knowing that ahead of time, I still ordered it to see how it would be.  I would say their smoked duck breast was well done... perfectly medium and nice juicy slices is a great way to enjoy the duck.  There was 3 parts to the platter... shiitake mushroom duck consomme, the smoked duck breast with the wrappers, and shredded duck fried rice.  The consomme was potent and highly flavourful.  I could only drink so much of it as it was quite overwhelming.  In the platter, the duck is not similar to traditional Peking duck but I do like how they served theirs (smoked and cooked medium rare).  They offered two types of wrappers (long romaine lettuce and the more traditional steamed pancakes) and gave you variety on how you want to build your own meal.  The sauce given was not the usual sweet hoisin sauce but rather a very pungent bean sauce.  I didn't enjoy it as much as the traditional hoisin but it was a good counter to the sweet Asian pear matchsticks.  The fried rice had some bigger pieces of shredded tender duck with edamame & peas.  I did find the fried rice to be a little oily with some of the rice a bit lumpy.  With all 3 dishes, it was a solid take on Peking duck and a nice dish to try. I wouldn't necessarily order it again as I would probably like to try other options on the menu. 3.5/5  Overall, Peoples eatery is a vibrant and great spot to enjoy modern Asian cuisine.  There are wonderful flavours (the 2 apps are highly recommended) here and the service exceeded our expectations.  If I'm ever in the Chinatown area, I wouldn't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Not really impressed with this place. I guess I was misinformed but I arrived thinking this was going to still be a relatively cheap eats kind of place, given the previous restaurant and it´s Spadina-Dundas location.  The food was reallllly expensive, I could have eaten at Patria or Byblos for the same price. The portions were ridiculous. I ordered a sashimi salad for $14, and it literally came with 2 tiny tiny pinky-finger sized pieces of sashimi on top of maybe half a cup of various greens. It blew my mind.   They also billed us incorrectly, we had ordered 4 orders of the chicken dish which was priced at $12, and on the bill they charged us $14 each. When I pointed it out, they mumbled something about how they had recently adjusted the price of that item.  Anyway the decor and ambiance are great but just don´t go here without knowing it´s going to cost a lot. We each had two dishes, so about $25 or $30 per person plus tax and tip, and I basically went home and had to make a second dinner afterwards."}
{"text":"A good first impression from the people who brought us Snack Bar.   The food was good as expected. I didn't have a chance to try too many items, but the persimmon 'salad' with parmesan oil was a most refreshing in idea and taste. As with Snack Bar, the great staff definitely add to the experience.  The cocktails were also on point and I can always appreciate a bar with a pisco cocktail on the menu.  The venue was quite packed and very loud for a Sunday evening. Overall, a great place if you are looking for a happening place with good music. but maybe not the best for catching up with an old friend!"}
{"text":"Good Location, Great Atmosphere, food is good but not on the cheap.. The Small \"Tacos\" are great and I was happy with the trout. Overall was satisfied and would recommend."}
{"text":"The place is trendy and service is great. In terms of food, it is the popular tapa style. We ordered two platters and two appetizers. The dishes are Asian fusion combining Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Korean and Japanese. The taste was good, but not good enough to wow. The tofu was a bit over cooked outside. There are better places of similar style in town."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is stuck in the middle of little China town. You'd miss it if you weren't looking for it...but you should!   The menu is ever changing and never the same. The decor is comfy and welcoming, the staff are knowledgeable of all their dishes and give excellent service...my water was never empty!  The food...the food is some Of the best I've ever had! If you're looking for flavours and multicultural cuisine, this is hands down the best spot!"}
{"text":"Great spot with a diverse menu.  Love the flavours and the staff are super friendly and helpful.  Tastes from all over and dont forget to check out upstairs for a quueter spot!"}
{"text":"Really like this place! Great food and drinks. Will be back again soon. Great spot in the summer and the second floor is great too."}
{"text":"BCT salad plate , Lamb brochettes, nice cocktails. Old school vintage vibe. I liked it a lot."}
{"text":"Disclaimer - I am friends with one of the staff, but other than a hearty hello and a gracious good-bye, I received the same (exceptional) service as everyone else that was dining there while I was.  Had a wonderful date at the restaurant - I'll break it down a little:  Atmosphere: It's an awesome spot for drinks/food/lounging, but as the night progresses (after about 10PM), people have more and more drinks, and the music (very good, by the way) volume increases to compensate for the volume of the guests, it can become a little difficult to carry on a conversation. No complaints at all - it's a by-product of people who are enjoying themselves!  Service: Top-notch. As most dishes are snack-size, they're delivered quite quickly with the dish described by the staff - a touch that I quite like, especially when there are lots of exotic ingredients. Dishes are also happily explained, which is nice given the exotic fusion of most items. I also liked the fact that at least of the staff visited the table with food or drinks to deliver, it gives the place a more intimate, relaxed feel, that everyone is working together to show the guests a great time.  Food: Very impressive. An eclectic menu that pulls from very different influences and delivers powerful tastes and a veritable symphony of textures. Many of the dishes have a perfect combination of smooth/saucy/crispy/crunchy going on all at once, which, when paired with the core flavors of the dish makes for a legitimate 'wow' experience. Additionally, the Peking Duck platter takes the snack game to the next level with generous portions of finger-friendly bits and a very cool take on an Eastern classic dish.  Favorites: The Fried Tongue Sandwich is sensational - the slight crisp that they put on the pretzel bun sends it over the top.  I'll be back for sure - the Smoked Fish platter is calling to me..."}
{"text":"Nice little gem in Chinatown, out of the ordinary. Lots of sexy amuse-bouches, creative cocktails, and friendly staff!! Definitely coming back!! And highly recommended...."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try the duck here for a while since I love asian fusion food but this is one of the rare moments where I feel like the original is a lot better. The serving size is tiny for $40/dish. I felt like the only addition that was made to this dish was the lettuce and pear which were both underwhelming."}
