{"text":"Great little Italian eatery. Highly recommend the stuffed hot peppers and the wedding soup. The pizza looked very good too! BYOB, NO COORKAGE FEE ( : Did I mention the prices are reasonable? Give it a try. Gret find"}
{"text":"Their coconut chicken salad was absolutely delicious. The flavors of the chicken, grilled pineapple and cranberries worked really well together.  I was pleasantly surprised how tasty it was. Best salad I've had in a while. I also like the variety of salad dressings. Service was a bit slow but still good. If you are looking for a non-chain place, this is your place . I like the menu. I'm tempted by the deserts but haven't had any yet."}
{"text":"For not being much of a breakfast person, this place got me to change my mind. Everything taste home-made, delicious. Their lunch and dinner is good as well but the breakfast is by far the best. Staff seems a little unorganized other wise they are friendly. Looking for a good sunday morning spot. Go to Casey's!"}
{"text":"Down home and delicious!   My dad loves the Italian omelet, so this is a frequent breakfast spot for my family.   It's a great, affordable dinner spot. Great Italian."}
{"text":"The waitress was nice   But the food took TO LONG ( 30 minutes) Just pancakes and an omelette  The place was empty   Food average"}
{"text":"This food is absurdly good. Poached eggs and hollandaise are what I've eaten at pricey East End brunch spots. Scrambled eggs are soft and fluffy, not overcooked. Tasty, well seasoned everything. Coconut chicken salad is exceptional; lightly breaded, real coconut, juicy and seared to perfection. Mixed greens in all salads. Housemade dressings to die for. Wedding soup - absolutely top of the heap in the whole region.   Great, now I'm starving."}
{"text":"Always good food at Casey's! My favorite place for breakfast, usually a wait but well worth it. Staff is great and food is consistently pleasant for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! The homemade Pizza crust is awesome!"}
{"text":"I can only speak for the breakfast... but, boy oh boy, was it good?! Traditional style breakfast offerings, cooked to perfection, good serving sizes - all at a completely reasonable price. Can't go wrong with Casey's for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Subpar food. Maybe it was the day but both myself and partner felt our food tasted old and fatty. Nice service but wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I've only gotten takeout from Casey's. I ordered Fettuccini Alfredo and Spinach & Artichoke Dip. The staff was very rude when I picked up my food. When I got it home, they didn't include the bread with the dip. So now I have dip and nothing to eat it with.. Food was very average. Won't be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"I've been to Casey's a few different times. The food is always good! The menu is long but not the kind of long that is completely overwhelming, so that's wonderful!  The atmosphere at Casey's is likely what keeps people coming back. It's like walking into your gammy's living room and dining room. Except that you have to pay for your food, and no one is asking you who you're dating and why you're not married yet.  If you're from the area, no doubt you'll run into someone you know. You'll have to decide for yourself if that is good or bad - love your neighbors? It's good! On the lamb? It's probably bad!   The one thing that Casey's is known for (at least from my experience or the people I know) that is not that great is the wait time. When you go to Casey's set aside a decent amount of time, because you will be there for a while. I'm not sure why causes the length... Possibly that there isn't enough room to hire other servers? They certainly have fit in as many tables and booths into the room as could legally be fit."}
{"text":"The last time we were there we called ahead and still had to wait 45 minutes for a table. we were seated and had a party of 6 (2 kids and 4 adults) and we sat for another 25 minutes and no one ever waited on us besides menus when they seated us and even the host was getting drinks for tables he sat after us but not us. We after another 5 minutes got up and left... I may be trying them again tomorrow and I will update then!!"}
{"text":"Comforable restaurant with a large menu and dependably good food. I don't think I've had anything I haven't liked except the creamsicle cake, but HEY, how often do you find that on a menu??  If you miss your grandma, come to Casey's.........there's always enough that I feel like I'm the youngest person in there.  Reliable with good food and a friendly wait staff. You will have to wait for a table during peak eating times."}
{"text":"This place just no. It is completely below average food and the ambiance leaves a lot to desire. Yea basically just do not go is what I recommend."}
{"text":"Ate there this morning. Bacon was burnt, they forgot to add mushrooms to a 'mushrooms and cheese' omelette, and to top it off I ordered a takeout bowl of soup and honest to God the waitress sneezed into her hand holding the styrofoam soup container and then said 'I'll go get your soup'. This is not my first bad experience here, but it sure is going to be my last. This place should have a lot higher standards if it's going to keep operating in Oakmont."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for brunch on a Sunday.   It took a long time to get seated, when there were tables available. They do have coffee for the wait however, which is nice. This seems to be a popular place with the sunday mass crowd.   We ordered both of the specials.  The first was a crab and veggie omlet, which was decent, but nothing to write home about.  The second was a french toast covered with cherry preserves. These were pretty much pie filling cherries, and the french toast was fairly generic bread. Thus, the flavors on a whole were overpowered by the canned pie filling. If I wanted that, I would make a mountain pie."}
{"text":"I've had many very good experiences here over the years but today's not so much...waitress is miserable and all of the lights are constantly flickering like we are in a haunted house...we won't be back for a while..."}
{"text":"Have had breakfast and dinner at Casey's and enjoyed both meals. This restaurant is kind of a throw back in time because the owner actually cares both about its patrons and the food. You will feel at home eating here enjoying good quality food and service. Forget the chains, eat at Casey's, the price is right and you are treated like you are a friend. Comfort food but with specials and  don't forget to bring a bottle of wine , there is no corkage. Nicely decorated, comfortable surroundings and good food plus BYOB with no corkage. My kind of restaurant and open 7 days a week!. Lots on the menu to try for breakfast, lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Nice little place on Allegheny River Boulevard in Oakmont. The food is decent but nothing special. They server average American dishes."}
{"text":"Wow,, what a great hometown restaurant, I believe if you cannot say nothing good, do not write a review, just move onto the next place, this place is awesome the staff is amazing, they also let you bring your own bottle, they treat you like royalty, the chef is impeccable, he always outdoes himself, the owners are great they take pride in the restaurant and she treats it like her own child, the staff are Very friendly very attentive you cannot be the food the taste the service, I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Great food great service their mushroom soup is fantastic!!! Great horseradish dip!!!"}
{"text":"They serve pasta with sliced white bread.  You know, like Wonderbread, except not as upscale. Skip this place and treat yourself to a meal at 7-Eleven, which has better food, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is good and fresh. Service is slow and most of the regular servers and front desk are not too friendly. They are always pretty busy with Seniors dining, but should treat their local families and 30-50's patrons better. BYOB is a good perk and food is worth the wait. My to-go's are usually skimpy or messed up, so be sure to check before you leave or just dine in. All in all as a local going their for years - def try it!"}
{"text":"Casey's is a great little place to have omelets and classic breakfast food. The portions are huge.  The eggs benedict is pretty good too. The services is good and parking is easy. You can take a walk in the adorable town of Oamont to work off the calories after!"}
{"text":"Decent food, but not the best service (slow). 40+min ticket time and louder than average noise levels. Nice little place though, if you're not in a rush and don't mind a little dust."}
{"text":"Standard breakfast/brunch/lunch type food. Cheap pricing. Gets very busy at breakfast on the weekends. Not a very big place to begin with"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the food and 3 for service.  This diner was recommended by a coworker so we went for dinner one rainy evening.  We were seated right away and our food arrived quickly. We noticed there seemed to be a few regulars eating at nearby tables.  Our waitress came by our table once to ask us if everything was okay but spent the rest of the time catering to the regulars and we felt neglected.  Needless to say the food was adequate and filling and the service sub-par. Cute country decor where pro golfer's signed plates adorn the wall."}
{"text":"This place is BYOB. Bring a bottle of wine to have with dinner. NO CORK FEE! There's a wine and spirits just a few feet away. The service isn't all that wonderful, but some of the servers mean well. However the wait for the food is usually worth it in the end. Nice change of pace with it not being a chain."}
{"text":"We were starving so the place was good enough. It is quaint and cute. The woman who seems to run the place was not welcoming at all and would be the #1 reason for me not to ever return. The employees seemed stressed, some more welcoming than others. The bacon is paper thin. The potatoes were good. The prices are decent. Overall, I would never recommend this place but would go back if there was nothing better around."}
{"text":"Casey's.   This is a local hot spot. Oakmonters love Casey's! It's definitely got a very southern/homey feel to it. I like coming here for breakfast with friends on a weekend or something. I like to come when I have a lot of time because it not only looks like you are in the South but feels like it. It's slow. Everything is slow. But when you're catching up with friends over breakfast...slow is kind of tolerable. Kind of. However, if I'm in a rush or just want a faster eating experience, Casey's ain't the place, ya'll (see what I did there?).   You know how they say if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck then it's probably a duck? Yeah. Casey's is really like a diner. Maybe that's very well known? I don't think they claim to be a diner but it tastes like a diner. So, I feel it is a bit overpriced for the quality of food.   Breakfast is tastey. It's a diner kind of breakfast - just more expensive.   Have time to kill? Want to step into coziness? Casey's. Try it."}
{"text":"I always come here when I'm in the area for the Italian wedding soup. I've never had better. It's homemade with tons of little meatballs, shredded chicken, spinach, carrots, onions and pasta. Very hardy soup. The place is very homey. The food is all Home cooking. This was the first trip for my entire family and they loved it too. My son had the kids cheeseburger and fries. It was very flavorful unlike most kids burgers. My husband had open face roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes. And I had the lunch special, half a tuna sandwich and fries. I added a cup of the wedding soup. Also took Home a quart of the wedding soup too. Our bill came to $40. The wait time for the food is a little long when they are full and it's hard to move around in the restaurant. They have more tables than they should. Never disappoints though!"}
{"text":"Food is decent here, but service can be slow at times. Once waited 15 mins for a glass of ice water that I asked the waitress and busboy for and never got it till the waitress came back with the check. But it is a decent place for such a small town."}
{"text":"Joanie was our server and she was very attentive. We got the Italian omelette and a side of fresh fruit. This place definitely does breakfast the right way. Fresh ingredients and hot off the grill. On a side note, we were able to observe one of the prep cooks in the kitchen. She spent the entire time peeling, chopping, and preparing carrots in the back. Everything is fresh here. Very impressive."}
{"text":"My husband is the from the Verona area so anytime we are close by and could have breakfast or lunch we are sure to stop at Casey's in Oakmont!  My first time there I had the chicken salad on a croissant and about 7 years later I haven't really ordered anything else! It's so good that I can't help but order it every time! I usually add a wedding soup to complete my meal and it's perfect!   The place feels so real. Meaning the older couple across from us was seated and the waitress already knew their order.  People are greeted by name and the staff is friendly to first timers. The decor is like Cracker Barrel but real, not manufactured by a chain. I always feel at home, almost as if I'm sitting in my grandmas dining room.   Sometimes there's a long wait and the bathroom is way too small but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Big menu, big portions, great price. Wait staff is always friendly and fast. Meals are just like homecooked. Plus you can walk the boulevard before or after. This is our go-to family place for lunch or dinner - a fantastic neighborhood spot. We love Casey's!"}
{"text":"I have been a 'diner' fan as long as I've been alive and craved a good plate of home cooked food, whether in the middle of the night after clubbing (in my youth) or for a good lunch (in my current elder state). Pittsburgh used to be awash with good diners. The Gazebo in Shadyside, Ritters, and a handful of others were damned good food, reasonably priced, and 24 hours. Most of them are gone, or like Ritters, just not as good as they used to be.  I would classify Casey's as a glorified diner, leaning a bit toward 'family restaurant' without the big chain homogenized 'off the Sysco truck' conveyor belt 'Denny's' fare.   Casey's is a pretty darned pleasant little neighborhood place to stuff your face with some decent food. Featuring (according to the menu) \"Mum-mum Tolerico's authentic Italian and specialty recipes, including homemade sauce, dough and meatballs made fresh daily\".   Oakmont is not a regular destination for me, unless I'm hitting the Miller Antique mall, or checking our a car cruise, but when I'm there and the idea of food starts rumbling in my stomach, Casey's is the FIRST place I'm going to hit.   I've had several of their sandwiches. From the Reuben, which is a standard Pittsburgh Reuben. Ok, but nothing to rave about in front of a New Yorker, to the Fish Sandwich, which is a very good and flavorful fish sandwich with a tasty and slightly zingy batter. AND - they serve it on a bun intended to fit a piece of fish. That always wins points in my book.  Friends have had burgers which looked very good, and I've seen many other plates whizzing past that looked very good. The fries are real potatoes with remnants of skins, and not poly fries pressed out of a corporate playdough machine. The coleslaw is different but very good. I'm definitely cool with different when it is done well and tastes good.   The menu is quite varied, with a short list of appetizers, to pizza and stromboli. Daily specials are posted on the white board as you enter the spot, the a nice list of dinner offerings as well.  And apparently to our waitress' chagrin, they serve Coke products. I always ask 'Are you Coke or Pepsi people?' and when I asked, she kind of frowned and grunted 'Coke'. Which of course made ME smile, since Diet Coke is the only soda I drink.   The atmosphere is comfortable, friendly neighborhood gathering spot for food. No over the top atmospheric kitsch, nor is it a dive. It's clean, the staff is friendly. On our last visit the waitress was a hoot, and that just adds to the comfort. Talk to me like a person. Joke with me. Be real. That wins me. Uppity attitudes, and flat out automaton personalities will send me away. This gal was great.  I wouldn't call it a 'destination' dining experience, but you can bet that if I'm in that area, it's the only place I'm going to go for food.  And overall, the immediate neighborhood is a very pleasant reminder of what a 'Main Street' of small town America could and should be. A handful of very small specialty shops, cobblestones, and nice folk.  However, I would not recommend dessert. Not because their desserts are bad. I wouldn't actually know - because just across the railroad tracks is the Oakmont Bakery. Take a short walk to jiggle a little extra space in your belly, and cross over the street to dessert heaven.  What's Cookin' at Casey's? Enough to stuff!"}
{"text":"My wife and I heard good things about their breakfast and how busy they get, so we stopped in on a late Sunday morning around 11 am. We expected to have a little bit of a wait, but were seated immediately. They have your standard breakfast fare, but it isn't quite a \"local diner,\" as it has more of a Bob Evans-type feel.   The positives: I ordered the country omelet, which was filled with mushrooms, peppers, onions, cheese, and ham. It wasn't greasy at all and was pretty good. So was the Mancini toast.  The negatives: The plate of fruit my wife ordered was a major disappointment for her, because it was basically canned mixed fruit with some bananas and strawberries thrown on top. You could taste the acidic juice it was swimming in. We had hoped a local, family-owned place would have fresh fruit. The raisin toast also tasted stale and didn't have any sweetness.   Lastly, the coffee was pretty bad - which is hard to do.  I still give it 4 stars because the eggs were good, which is the main staple of any breakfast anyway."}
{"text":"While visiting my aunt, we decided to go to What's Cookin' at Casey's. Small quaint place. Nothing fancy but food is reasonably priced and the place is very clean. Street parking is your only option.  BYOB and no cork charge."}
{"text":"Despite friends loving this place, have tried it now 3 occasions...2x for breakfast and 1x for dinner.    The food was ok, not great.  The 2x times for breakfast - the first time the breakfast was not real good (service was good).  The second time was a \"walk out\".  Appreciate getting coffee while waiting but once we were seated, no one came for our table (I actually do not think any servers were assigned to our table).  After 10 minutes, we got up and left.  The dinner experience was similar experience...ok but there are other places/options in my opinion that are better.    I can't and won't give it 2 star or less - better than that but service was not good twice and ok once and food was \"ok\" at best.  If I could give it 2.5 stars, I would.   Not the best by far and not the worst by far."}
{"text":"What's cooking at Casey's? Nothing overly delectable at this Oakmont fixture, but it's filling + moderately priced. The standard breakfast fare needs a bit more flavor, especially the home fries. And the pancakes were a little too dense for my liking. The dinner menu favors Italian w/ the calzone easily taking the 'best value' title. Overall, their food has been hit or miss over the years as has their service. However, it's still a decent option to \"eat local.\""}
{"text":"Although I am rarely in Oakmont, my best friend lives there and has taken me to Casey's a few times while I am visiting.  We went for dinner on Saturday night and I had an amazing salad - Casey's Famous Caesar Salad.  The addition of tortellini was really great and the grilled chicken was perfectly seasoned.  This was a large salad that I could not even finish and came to under $13.  The only complaint that I have is that service was a little slow initially, but it did seem like they were slammed with customers because their food is so good!"}
