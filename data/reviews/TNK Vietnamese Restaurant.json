{"text":"I think the best Vietnamese food can be found in the NE and T&K definitely supports my theory.

They're known for their Banh Hoi (a special way vermicelli is prepared) with various styles of meat fillings that you wrap into rice paper, so we got an order of it along with Banh Xeo (a large Vietnamese style crepe stuffed with pork, shrimp and bean sprouts), my parents ordered a large soup (not Pho lol but I can't remember what it's called) and my boyfriend had the grilled beef and spring roll vermicelli bowl.

Plates of freshly washed lettuce and herbs were brought out with our food and we all dug in. There was enough Banh Hoi to make 10 or so wraps (depending how much you put in your wraps) and the Banh Xeo crepe was crispy and had a hint of coconut (I normally don't eat this since I'm not a fan of bean sprouts)

Definitely authentic Vietnamese food that's worth the trip to the NE, and for 6 people to be fully fed for under $100 it's a steal!"}
