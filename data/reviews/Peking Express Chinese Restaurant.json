{"text":"nice man with a nice business. new cook who cant cook. 3 times the salt in my tofu dish, not genuine szechuan sauce, just thin drippy soy.....GET A REAL COOK WHO CAN COOK. the meal was basically inedible because of the excess salt content....I feel sorry for the owner who has to hire inexperienced cooks. i think the cook was mexican. can mexicans cook chinese food? POSSIBLY, BUT NOT AT THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Last night we wanted some Chinese Food. This location was new so I called to find out about there menu. The girl said they don't make lo mein.  I name a couple of foods I liked and none of them we're available,   plus. Some foods that they did have Like Orange chicken were over priced.  The worse was this was over the phone.   The girl. Was too rude for words,   we didn't even go in to find out how the food was.   And never will."}
