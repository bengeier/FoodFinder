{"text":"We have had sushi dinner and lunch special there and found the food fresh and really excellent.  Wide variety on the menu and a great dining option for the Monroeville Mall area.  Also very reasonable and accommodating."}
{"text":"Hi Sapporo. First time here for us people who are always on the lookout for a new and good dining experience.

Nice new restaurant. Nice well trained service. Nice new outstanding interior. Nice and friendly new owner and manager. Nice try all the way around. 
We enjoyed our experience here, our food was not outstanding, it was okay,  but everything else was very good.  My best advice is keep trying and improving Sapporo.

We will wait a while and come back and check you out for improved food freshness, recipe flavor and will be looking for the yum effect.  Improve that sushi freshness too.
We are very much in favor of your success and wish you the best throughout your start-up phase."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new place, and we have been meaning to check it out.  We will for sure be back!

There is an extensive menu.  Sushi, chinese, japanese, and curry options, so there is something for everyone.  

As strange as this may sound, the highlight of the meal for me was the free appetizers they gave at the beginning of the meal.  There was a \"hot cucumber\" item (for lack of a better term) that was simply amazing.  The cucumber bits were still nice and crisp, but had a hot tangy flavor to them.  I asked if I could get seconds and they were nice enough to oblige.

My fiance and I split a Rock N Roll and it was tasty.  Not that original, but we both enjoyed it.  It had a lot of flavor and each of the flavors did stand out.  

I ordered the chicken teriyaki dinner bento box and was quite pleased.  It came with my choice of soup (I had hot and sour), a sald, white rice, and then several choices for sides.  You were able to choose either tempura vegetables, chicken katsu or seaweed salad, shumai, Gyoza or a spring roll and a choice of one of three sushi rolls.  It was a bargain for the amount of food you got at $15.  

My fiance ordered one of the traditional chinese dishes and was quite pleased as well.   

Service was quick and attentive, even with my multople requests to refill my water glass.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My mom and I just stumbled on this place after deciding we needed to grab a bite to eat, and man am I glad we did.  This place is not just Chinese, its not just Japansese, its not even just a sushi bar.  They have Indian, Chinese, Japanese, and many many more delicious options.

My mom and I started off with a nice sashimi appitizer and I was happily suprised when the waitress told me they did not have a certain kind of fish because she would not want to sell something to us that she did not think would be the best quality.  I would rather not have all my dining options than be served old seafood.  Reguardless, what she brought out was delicious, and very inexpensive.

Our meals were also delicious.  I even got to tailor my order to have it cooked with garlic sauce rather than the traditional brown sauce.  This place is also BYOB!  You should check it out if you like Asian Cuisine."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary and had the shashimi appetizer, pad Thai, sushi and chicken and veggies. Everything was amazing! Such a find in monroeville. We didn't have to wait and the staff was so friendly. The food was fresh and fantastic. Also the pre-appetizers they give u are great! I love the spicy cucumber. Everything is so reasonably priced too! Will return often!"}
