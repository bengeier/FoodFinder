{"text":"Always solid burgers. Very good crispy fries. I had the salmon sandwitch and it was very good too. Relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Meh... short review for posterity sake... bland burgers make me sad.wont be going back... unless its my birthday... then its free right?"}
{"text":"We always go there to watch games. 
I dont understand why this place is so underrated. 
Love their burgers, salads and most importantly the tiny sundae. 
Service is great and they always send us coupons. If they put more big screen tvs, i will update my rating to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Meh. This place doesn't suck, but it's not very good. The only time you should really go is if it's your birthday so you can have free beer.

Their menu is incredibly boring and extremely overpriced for the quality of ingredients that they use. On my most recent visit, our table got an order of Nachos to share. With chicken, it cost $12.50. It was nothing more than a plate of tortilla chips covered in Day-Glo orange cheese, jalapeno slices, and gray (eww) dried out chicken pieces. I also had a burger as my entree, and the beef tasted a little funky, like it had been reheated in a microwave--almost metallic. My dining partner had a salad that she seemed to enjoy, but it's hard to mess up a simple green salad. Sadly, I've been here more often than I'd like to admit because they host Team Trivia on Tuesday nights. My boyfriend and I decided to start going somewhere else for trivia when we recently won and got a $40 gift certificate and weren't excited to use it because it meant we'd have to try to consume more of their crappy food. We spent it mostly on booze instead."}
{"text":"This place is great for birthdays. You get your glass mug filled with beer, soda, or juice with unlimited refills, while also getting a very small ice cream sundae at the end.  The burgers were very tasty and cooked as requested. Our server was very good and on top of refills and food came out of the kitchen pretty quick.   I liked the atmosphere in the dining area with tv's mounted throughout the restaurant.  The bar area was not huge, but I could see it being a fun atmosphere later on in the night."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with my meal this evening, actually I didn't even come close to taking more than two bites. I ordered two burgers to go and was unpleasantly surprised when i got home less than 1 mile from The Nitty to an ice cold meal. The burned, and soggy Bruschetta Burger is actually only a burger with a piece of mozz cheese and sprinkles of chopped tomato and a few flakes of freeze dried basil.  Also, the french fries had probably been prepared 45 minutes previous. This might be a place for a free birthday drink, but definitely not a place for anything else."}
{"text":"This Nitty Gritty I would have to say is not as good as the downtown madison one and the sole reason is that it is way too small for how many people generally go there. Also their dartboard and such is not well placed and becomes a nuisance when trying to return to the bar for another drink. They have good drink specials and its still got that classic nitty atmosphere but not great..."}
{"text":"Good place.  Gritty sauce is yummy!!!  They do a decent job of food and the atmosphere is great.  Come here on your birthday.

Daughter ordered Mac & cheese.  She hated it. So I tried it. Disgusting. Tasted rotten.  Don't order!!!!"}
{"text":"Went recently for my own birthday, since I really didn't want to put much thought or effort into planning my party. Even though it was a Friday, we didn't have to wait for a table. Service was prompt and they put up with our group that had people straggling in. I really enjoy their chipotle burger, and another of my group loved how her steamed veggies were cooked. I did get a mixed drink from a friend and it did come tasting weak/watery (I didn't personally order it, so maybe I missed something if I would have looked at the drink menu). The whole experience was good, but not spectacular, at least try it for your birthday once!"}
{"text":"the nitty gritty gets 1 star from a lifelong patron... because I can't give it zero tonight.

We were out for my fiance's 30th birthday. 

I grew up going to the Gritty to celebrate and we bring relatives when they are in town on a birthday.

Tonight however was deplorable.
if we weren't going to see a movie afterwards we would have just left and gone elsewhere (may have been faster actually). 

We were seated at the weird table upstairs that is in the center of the room and crushed up against the bar. All the boothes were full so that's understandable.
what is not understandable, is that we sat there for over 10 minutes with NO service at all.
no hellos, no be right with yous, no waters etc.
I went up to the bar and asked the 4 servers behind the counter if they knew who our server was as we had been waiting awhile.
they saw the table I pointed at and after some faltering, gave me the reason that our server just hasn't had time to get to us...
I said ok and sat back down.
about the minutes later our server Ellie comes up.
no apology.
she thanked us for our patience.
that really irritated me as we had been waiting for 15 minutes!
so I responded well we didn't really have a choice did we?
we had sat so long with menus we knew what we wanted.
I ordered water, and a double brat sandwich with fries. while my fiance ordered I realized that the single is on a pretzel roll, which I would rather than the doubles hoagie.
He ordered a burger and waffle fries, and an appetizer of cheese curds for us to split.
I apologized and said I would actually like to change my order to the single brat basket please.
ok fine.
Some boothes had cleared up so I requested we be moved there.
we were able to move, and I was very appreciative of the accommodation.
our \"food arrived\" very quickly, and I was almost ready to say wow!!! the speed makes up for this so far... but then we looked at our food.
my fiance's order was correct, but there was no appetizer. 
my order was a double brat, with no side, or the raw onion I ordered.
when I explained this was wrong, she seemed very confused and when I explained what I ordered she told me she thought I meant a single....
the excuse doesn't make sense but ok.
unfortunately I realized that it was wrong while I started squeezing my ketchup on it.
she took my basket and walked away.
no apology.
my brat came back immediately!
but when it was set down in front of me, it was a single brat alone.
she asked if it was right and I explained that the brat was but I had a basket (?).
She told me that my fries were cooking and she wanted to get me my entree right away...
ok, that is good because I am starving and my fiance had finished his burger already ( I insisted he eat his BIRTHDAY meal hot..while I waited).
my basket of fries emerged with a basket of curds. 
so I ate my side while my fiance picked at our curds.
I asked for our check and explained we were getting to a movie afterwards and just wanted to get it while we still had her at the table (she was seating a table of 11 people... who had no water for at least 10 minutes )...
she asked if she could interest us in mini sundaes to \"make up for it\" and we declined...
we took our nephew here for his birthday in september... and that isn't an apology, it's part of the birthday experience. 
we declined.
she brought our check and explained she voided \"that stuff off so our check is right\".
pleasantly surprised, and impressed I expected perhaps the app to be free.
what she meant however, was that she deleted the mistakes she had made, so our bill was correct.
we checked our bill and she was nice enough to wait for our card because we were wanting to leave asap. 
she ran the card and apologized.
and that was our major milestone birthday experience...

as someone who has waitresses for years, I understand the challenges of the job. 
however shame on you for not having basic apologetic instincts to such crappy service.
and an even bigger shame on you to the servers behind that bar who all knew we had been waiting for so long, to not help out and bring us 2 glasses of water, simply because we weren't their table. that isn't even including the fact that they were unapologetic, as well as what appeared to be annoyance with me.

embarrassing for your business."}
{"text":"It's the birthday spot!  Ever since I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday last year, he insists on making it his tradition.  

I have never been here when it is crazy packed, which is one of the biggest appeals to me.  It's not overly crowded like the downtown one, so I can actually move around.  I am not entirely sure if there is a specific time where it fills up or not, but, I have been here all times of day and have yet to see a completely full house.

The burgers and other food are delicious, as to be expected.  Our personal favorite are the cheese curds.  In fact, they are a must when we come and need sustenance.  We always order extra gritty sauce, too, because, well, it's yummy.

The service here has always been friendly and prompt.  We always end up staying longer than expected because we love talking with the bartenders, who are always fun and have fantastic people skills.

There are usually some pretty great drink specials for every day of the week at all times of the day; so if you're on a budget, there will be something to make your wallet happy.

My only complaint is that the last 2 times we have come here, we have used our 2 for 1 burger coupon and the discount was not applied to our check; so, we have had to remind the person closing us out or even have had to drive back to get the adjustment made, which is a bit inconvenient, but it is what it is.

That won't stop me from coming back, but I will take some extra time to look over my check going forward."}
{"text":"It's the Gritty, so if you've lived in Madison for any amount of time you pretty much know what to expect. First time at this location, service was great, food was good and the Birthday special can't be beat. 

Its obviously going to be a little more relaxed and low-key than the downtown location, you have a view of a parking lot and Gammon Ave instead of campus, but you know that going in. We weren't there with kids, but seemed pretty open and kid-friendly."}
{"text":"This place is usually a fave but the recently its been not so good. The food is passable and the service is pretty slow especially on semi-busy nights. It took our party of 6 two hours to get our food."}
{"text":"We have been to this Nitty Gritty a bunch of times and usually would be a 4 out of 5. The food is above average and prices aren't to bad. Food always seems to come out a longer than usual.

I could tell tonight was not going to be good. My wife asked our waitress what the drink specials were and she said \" i think we have some but i dont know what they are, they are on a board over by the bar.\" As i lean around my booth to look she says \"o you can't see them from here they are on the other side of the wall at the bar.\" So you would think she would go look......you'd be wrong.  So i then tell my wife while our server is there that i guess she will have to get up and go look at the board herself, as our waitress stans there and says nothing. Nooooo \"let me check on those for you or heavens no you shouldn't have to get up yourself when its my job or i should know the specials.

So we never found out the specials but ordered 2 burgers. Mine comes out with the wrong cheese on it, and to her credit she says do you want a new one? However ive waited tables for 6 years so it shouldn't have even made it out of the kitchen like that. However we have a 2 year old so this is not an option to wait for another burger to be made.  After that we see our waitress 1 time every 10 to 12 minutes.  Sat with 2 empty drinks for about 10, then other staff deliver refills, a box for food and the bill for her.

Weve been here about 5 times before but honestly with all the restaurants Madison has to offer, we probably won't go back, especially if she is out waitress again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place in the world! Service can be hit or miss (usually younger high school aged servers) but the tasty burgers are so worth a trip every time I'm in town! My favorite is the roasted garlic burger with cheese curds. The curds come with a side of gritty sauce for dipping--yum! Recently they have added a $10 burger basket which comes with any burger, fries and beverage! A great deal considering a burger alone is about $10 anyway. Don't forget that on your birthday you drink free all day! Best way to celebrate!"}
{"text":"The food,service and hospitality is always exceptional. One of the best kept secrets at the Gritty is the grilled Alaskan Sockeye Salmon sandwich. It's the best in town!"}
{"text":"It's the Nitty Gritty! Its a chain with the best possible birthday deal aka free drinks all day of your birthday!!! That includes a range from beer to milkshakes to plain old soda. its your pick! you also get a shout out, a balloon, and a glass to keep. 

now for the food, nothing here is that amazing. The burgers are decent and the cheese curds are nice since you can make them a side, but nothing stands out too much here. There are some good happy hour times, but be aware that there are more birthdays that fall everyday of the week so sometimes you'll show up on a random tuesday and be waiting for a table for an hour. 

service is mediocre at best and the environment can sometimes range from ok to divey.  

happy drinking, because thats the only reason you should really come here."}
{"text":"The same excellence you get from the other Nitty Gritty restaurants, only in a smaller, quieter (generally) atmosphere.  The Strawberry Fields Salad is not only a clever play on a great Beatles tune, but outstanding.  Huge fan of the gorgonzola and Washington apple salad with raspberry vinaigrette (add salmon) too."}
{"text":"I really like this Nitty Gritty location. No offense to the downtown location but this one is a little more sane for semi-quiet dinners or a cool trivia night. The brunch is always satisfying and the cheese curds are one of my favorites in Madison. I highly recommend the Falafal Burger for an interesting alternative to a Veggie Burger."}
{"text":"Great burgers and great atmosphere.  And hands down the best coleslaw I have ever had in 37 years of life.  The steakhouse burger was very good and from the kids corner, the mac and cheese and Abby's grilled cheese were superb.  I will return to this fine establishment."}
{"text":"I like the variety of burgers that they have - and that they can do them gluten free. It can be a little loud, especially at nights or during sports ball. If they had a GF fryer, I'd give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good local bar and great staff. I feel like one of the staff every time i am there. Love the Gritty!"}
{"text":"I live 2 minutes away (walking distance) from the Nitty Gritty in Middleton. My friends constantly tell me that they are very good and you also get this very cute miniature cupcake for your birthday when you dine in. They also told me that their cheese curds were the best and that i should really try them, and so i finally did. I walked to the Nitty Gritty with six dollars in my pocket, thinking ahh, i doubt i would need this much for some cheese curds, but i still took it with me to be safe. When i entered the building, i went up to the counter and ordered the cheese curds for take out. I didn't ask about the price nor did the waitress tell me anything so i just waited there for a fair amount of time until i got my food. the waitress the gave me a reciept that read $6.59 total and i was a bit suprised. Obviously i was short of money by 59 cents but the waitress kindly gave me the 59 cents and waved it off. After i left my money on the counter, i walked back home and opened the small container that contained only a couple of cheese curds, each the size of a quarter, and along with it a ranchy dipping sauce. I will say that the cheese curds were pretty good and the sauce, i very much enjoyed. i give this a 3 out 5 because i thought for such a small portion of chees curds, they went a bit over priced. this was my first time getting food from the nitty gritty but it probably won't be the last."}
{"text":"Wow, Why haven't I reviewed this place yet? Alright on to the show, I had stopped in here for a little happy hour refreshment one blustery Tuesday and was about the 3rd person at the bar. Place was deserted, I though whatever.... 

I had a soda and some cheesecurds, real men drive sober ya know. Cheesecurds were available in two options, white cheddar and yellow cheddar. The white cheddar ones aren't uniformly shaped like the yellow cheddar ones. They give you this sauce to dip them in. All appetizers are 1/2 during happy hour so that was a plus. 

The cheesecurds came out and they were..... ok... I've honestly had better cheesecurds. The sauce was rich so I didn't use a lot of it. The curds were far too small and some seemed over fried. My better half had a mixed drink, (name escapes my mind right now) and she said it was bland."}
{"text":"-always get a fun atmosphere with the Nitty
-our server said he could but didn't want to order us drinks out of hassle
-bartender had to look up drink recipe/lack of experience"}
{"text":"The worst places I've found in the Madison area still manage to be 4 stars, at least to me. The beer selection here is on the small side but they have some nice ones. The portions were a bit small for the price, but the food was delicious. I was happy to have two types of cheese curds to choose from, as the mozzarella can get melty, but the cheddar stays firm. I got grilled cheese with extra cheese (because Wisconsin) and it came out super-melty and every bit as cheesy as I wanted it to be. Grilled cheese with a side of cheese curds? I had the waitress convinced I was local, when I was by far the farthest traveler to the dinner. And yes, other people enjoyed their food, it wasn't just me in a cheese coma oblivious to their suffering.

I think the birthday thing would get annoying after a very short while. I dealt with it for one night. But that could deduct another star if I were a local. Fortunately, I'm not."}
{"text":"Watched the Packers here. Popular place for birthdays. Good food too... Seemed like a draft of smoke came in when the door opened which was annoying... But overall a great environment."}
{"text":"You know I hate to do this but I have to agree with Vickey M.  The Gritty burgers are something of an acquired taste.  They taste good to me because they bring back memories of the 70s.   They do have good flavor but are somewhat messy and there are better burgers than the Gritty.   
The bar was more fun when it was small.  We don't go there anymore because often it is so busy that we can't really enjoy the place like we used to.
But I would stop by again for the Gritty Burger.

I recently learned that the gritty burger recipe was changed in the 80s sometime?   Correct me if I'm wrong.   We did think the burger was somewhat different from what we remember.  Now we know why.  The old burger that everyone loved was way better than the new one.
We think they need to enlarge the place and bring back the original burger if they still have the recipe.   The sauce was the bomb."}
{"text":"The last two times that I've stopped here the service was slow. If it were not for the people I would give them a better review. Lots of staff walking around but not helping customers. On top of that the food has slid to average. Not the same as downtown. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Nitty for years for birthdays. I can't say that I've ever had a remarkable meal, but it's a classic for birthdays in an area that doesn't have any other restaurants close by. Free drinks on your birthday in a free mug. Burgers here are pretty good!"}
{"text":"Tonight the fam got Nitty Gritty takeout, and for me it was a disappointment. I had suggested the NG because I'd been craving chicken tenders all day. In the past, NG's chicken appeared to be hand-breaded and had a decent dose of pepper in the breading to give it some flavor. Tonight's offering was a step above cafeteria chicken strips. Flat, factory-breaded, flavorless, and all of them with that gross gooey translucent strip of whatever you get in cheap chicken. Making it worse was the addition of soggy fries and not-as-good-as-I-remembered Gritty sauce. For almost $10, I'm calling this a total bust. Yet another restaurant I can cross off the list for upping price and cutting quality."}
{"text":"The Nitty in Middleton seems to live off of its name recognition. The food is so-so at best. I had the premium Prarie Farms burger. To bad it was completely unseasoned. Toasting the bun on a $10 burger would've been a nice touch and would have added som texture. Why bother to pay for a premium products if they aren't properly prepared. I also think the menu is in the pricey side for basic so-so bar food. The choice of sides did yield a nice surprise - fresh asparagus spears.  

This meal was a disappointment. There are few places that can pull off a decent burger. You want a great pub burger... Hit the Eastside - go to Players."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink or a burger. Pretty good brunch menu too!
Trivia on Tuesdays is pretty fun as well"}
{"text":"Nuh uh. Nope. No no no. My daughter wanted to eat here for her birthday this year, having eaten at the one downtown successfully 4 years ago. Her birthday, her pick. Plus, she delights in the free mug of soda and balloon. She's a birthday sell-out and I think that must be how they suck you in. 
But, I digress. Our order took an aggravatingly long time to arrive and our glasses remained empty after having drunk their contents while waiting. There was a Packers game on and many of the wait staff were watching that. I don't know if that was the hold up, but it was a bit irritating. 
When our meals finally arrived, my children discovered that the insides of their burgers were very pink. Waaaaay too pink for medium well, which they ordered. It was scary pink and super soft--like raw hamburger generally is. When I told our waiter about it, he was completely uninterested in helping fix the situation, and instead, argued with me about it for quite a while, finally saying, \"That's what medium well looks like\" in a tone that suggested that I was simply too stupid to know the difference. I'm not. Finally I convinced him to humor me and take them back to be cooked through. He did so with a smidgen of contempt.
As a side-note, my husband's burger was to be well done and was also pink, though not raw.
Still no drink refills.
No one offered a discount, a refund, a free soda while we waited, and especially not an apology. Obviously we won't be back."}
{"text":"Far in my past are the days of rushing to the Gritty the moment it opened on my birthday and getting started on my free beer in the short time -- ok, hours -- before my friends arrived. However, a group of us comes here on summer Thursday nights quite regularly to take advantage of the outdoor patio with a lovely parking lot view on $3 craft beer night. If you're there for the 10 o'clock Power Hour, it's almost like every day is your birthday because the High Lifes are just a buck. Throw in some appetizers (the wings are great for a non-wing place) and of course, the occasional Gritty Burger because for the love of all things iconic to Madison, we are at the Gritty! The staff, from the bartenders to the servers on up to management, has been great to us every time. West Side pub options are somewhat limited, but the Gritty helps solve that problem."}
{"text":"The Gritty doesn't disappoint. Good food, good drinks, and excellent service. The downside? Because of the birthday popularity (unlimited refills of soda or beer on your birthday) this place is always busy. This isn't always the \"I can't get a table\" busy but it is the loud, \"can't hear myself think\" busy. Whether it's rowdy college kids, rambunctious 10 year olds, or middle-aged midlife crises, be prepared to spend your meal in silence because you won't be able to hear your dining partner unless they've brought a megaphone."}
{"text":"I felt a little bit like I was in a Chuck E Cheese due to some nearby birthday shenanigans, but the Texas burger I ordered was a solid 4 stars. In my opinion, this is one of the few restaurants in the area with a genuinely delicious burger. Nitty Gritty is probably not a place I would visit with my husband on a date night, but it's a great place to take the kids!"}
{"text":"My stomach is still not right after eating there two days ago. My sister-in-law was sick all day yesterday as well.  I'm not a fan of the Nitty Gritty but for some reason my family wanted to come here.  We were seated upstairs even though the restaurant was empty at 11a on a Saturday. The waitress was friendly enough but once our orders were taken she was MIA until the food came out 25 minutes later.  I had to go downstairs to refill our drinks.  There must've been 15 employees there, most of them standing around.  While the food tasted good, it obviously wasn't cooked properly or had some other issue I'd rather not think about. My brother ordered their fried donuts, took one bite and pushed them aside.  He said they tasted just like their fries and everything else they deep fry.  My cousin's burger had so much gritty sauce on it that it literally poured out of the back end when he took his first bite.  My aunt ordered the same burger and hardly had any gritty sauce on hers. 

Service at ANY Nitty Gritty is typically slow and spotty, even when it's not busy.  I find their food to be average and way over-priced.  I know it's the \"Birthday Bar\" but you can typically drink for free at a lot of other places with better service and food (and you don't have to stick to tap beers).  Silver Eagle allows you to drink rail booze, tap beers AND they give you a free burger and birthday shot - so the Gritty's birthday specials CAN be beat."}
{"text":"We came here a handful times after Dotty Dumpling's and I went through a brief break up (but no worries, we've learned to love each other once again). Burgers are okay. Like some have mentioned, the burgers are an acquired taste--I don't think the beef patty was thick enough or had much flavor, and the toppings on the burger just didn't meld well together. Spinach dip that we got once was pretty good, though.

Another thing that really bothered me was that when I ordered mini hamburgers for my kids I looked at the patty and they were still pink. My husband and I don't mind ordering burgers for ourselves medium, but we try to hold that off for the kids. Granted, we did not specify that we wanted our kids' burgers well done, but I was surprised that wouldn't be common practice for kids' food.

On the other hand, it is a fun place and good for parties with kids and/or a crowd. The beer selection is decent, and you get a very nice mug if you eat here on your birthday. My son also loves the video games here.

All in all, a decent restaurant. There are several places in Middleton or West Madison that have better food, but it's a nice place to go to have a good appetizer and maybe split a burger with a friend on your birthday."}
{"text":"Stopped here to celebrate my Dad's upcoming 89th birthday, proving you're never too old to have a good time at the Nitty Gritty. Burgers were great and their beer list is extensive, with lots of choices from both near and far. My Dad enjoyed the attention as well as the birthday treats. Thank you for helping make the day special."}
{"text":"We called ahead and made a reservation ahead of time. Upon arrival our table was not ready and we had to wait 45 min for the table to be ready. We were on a schedule and this is why we called ahead and made a reservation. Once seated our waiter seemed like he had no serving experience or training, no one was apologetic for the long wait time. The server asked what we would like to drink but, before anyone could answer he would just walk away. It took multiple times of this occurring before anyone had drinks and some of the drinks that were ordered never arrived or were wrong. We told the server we were ready to order as we needed to be out at a specific time, the time I had reserved if sat close or on time to that requested time we would have had 2 hours from start to Finish. After waiting 45 min for a table and now over 20 minutes to get drinks we were at less then a hour to order, eat, pay and leave. Trying to order went the exact same way as trying to order drinks one person would order and he would just walk away, after numerous times waving him down to come back to take everyone's order we finally got all orders in. Food arrived quickly, but no silverware or napkins were given. So once again we had to find the sever to bring us napkins and silverware. No one stopped back to check on us or refill drinks. We had to find the sever to get our checks and multiple checks were not correct.  I am a server and I work in a busy restaurant I know that serving can be overwhelming at times and yes mistakes happen. This experience was the worst service I have ever received. I am not sure if it's a training issue, or if he was overwhelmed or if this job is just not for him. I have never had a bad experience at Nitty Gritty before this experience, maybe it was a off day or there is a lack of training or managing of team members. Nitty Gritty is a fun place to be and the food is always good but the service we received during this visit has made me want to visit a different location on my next visit."}
{"text":"I was in town for training at Epic. Wanted a bar with good food to watch baseball playoffs. I remembered the Nitty Gritty near campus from a previous visit, so tried the one in Middleton close to my hotel.

BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich - Outstanding!
Waffle fries - Excellent
Capital Amber draft - very good
Atmosphere - Fun
Service - great.

Too bad it wasn't my birthday.

It seemed that everyone there had a birthday celebration in the group.  That's their thing.  I'll go back, even if it's not my birthday."}
{"text":"Delicious pork sandwich with coleslaw and very attentive service at modest prices in a rustic atmosphere"}
{"text":"This past weekend I was visiting Madison for a conference and ate at the Nitty Gritty with a group of 50 people. The service was outstanding, friendly, attentive and quick. My water glass was never empty. The restaurant has two levels with high ceilings and polished wood floors. A relaxed, clean atmosphere.

My table of 5 started with chicken strips, good and standard and spinach dip. The spinach dip is excellent, extra cheesy and hot served with chips, and fresh veggies- carrots, celery, broccoli and cauliflower.

We all had burgers and fries. The burger was enormous I could only eat 1/2. Pretty good deal for around $6.

If you are in the area I recommend  the Nitty Gritty."}
{"text":"It's an annual event to hit Nitty Gritty on (or around) my birthday.  I always enjoy the new mug and whatever I can fit into it that day. :)

On top of the mug and free drinks, I do enjoy their food - hopping around the various burger options depending on how I feel that day.  The food is consistently good and always prepared as ordered.

It's a clean, friendly environment.  Service is always friendly and prompt.  I have no reservations taking the family there, or meeting with a work group for drinks."}
{"text":"The food was good. Our server  was terrible. I would rather have mediocre food and great service, than great food and terrible service. We went there on the 14th of August and were seated upstairs. Firstly, there is only one drink menu on the table. So right from the start we were put off a bit when I asked our server what beers they had on tap and he points to the drink list in my wife's hand and lets me know that the choices are in there. After he came back with our drinks I asked about the cheese curds. They have an order of the white, and an order of the yellow curds. I wanted a mixture, but was curtly informed that they are already sorted and cannot be combined. Which, is fine if they won't do it, but I don't know because he didn't go ask someone else. Then when my wife ordered her food, he asked her what side she wanted. She didn't know what the sides were and asked. Instead of telling her he pointed, once again, to the menu and let her know that its all in there, and also that its the small writing by the burgers. When she asked about what kind of fries they served, he told her I don't know, fries. Very frustrating. I have only tipped a flat 10% a handful of times. This was one of those times. It was such a let down because we were pretty excited about trying out the Nitty Gritty."}
{"text":"Maybe I missed something about this place, but after three tries, I just had to stop going back hoping I would finally feel the magic. The burgers are okay, but there are better ones in Madison. 

The last time we were there, my son's chicken sandwich was overcooked, and they charged more money since he got it on a pretzel bun instead of the regular bun. Our burgers were unremarkable - not that flavorful or moist. The buffalo wings were greasy and actually not hot when we got them. And the last night we were there, a Friday at about 6:00, the place was full and the service was terrible. As in waiting over fifteen minutes after I had piled all the dirty dishes at the end of the table as a hint that we were way done before the server came by wondering if we wanted anything else. 

And somehow, with four people, no alcoholic drinks, two appetizers, and four sandwiches, our bill was over $70. That's US dollars. Before the tip. They charge extra for everything - ranch on the side, cheese on a burger - everything. For a really marginal meal and lousy service, that was way too much money."}
{"text":"You used to be so much more. Great servers, great food, a place I couldn't wait to return to. The service has been getting progressively worse. Last time I visited, my friend ordered a veggie burger and the wrong toppings were put on it. It was sent back to the kitchen for correction. We were sitting by the window where you could see the food prep. We saw the cook touch raw meat and then saw them touch my friend's burger. This time, the service was abysmal. The waitress even apologized for her lack of attention. Gave us free drinks, and coupons. However, when the restaurant became less crowded, she sat at the bar on her phone. I had to flag down another waitress for assistance. After we finished our meal a different server cleared our dishes And we waited 20 minutes for our check. We never saw our check."}
{"text":"Nitty Gritty is a decent sports bar with a pretty good atmosphere. It looked like if it is your birthday that this is definitely a good place to be as I think you get free food and drink day of your special day! To start the meal out I went with the cheese curds which honestly were pretty dang good! Great battering and really good dipping sauce! The server steered me towards the Nitty Burger so of course I went won't big Nitty (12oz). To be completely honest the best way I can describe it is it's your typical bar burger. Nothing too crazy, not going to disappoint, but also not going to impress. It was a decent meal but nothing to write home about"}
