{"text":"We have been to Oceana a couple of times and have found the food there is really hit and miss. For a fine dining experience I expect my food to be consistently top notch, and unfortunately that does not appear to be the case here.  Before my review of our dining experience I do have one thing to note;  On our most recent visit to Oceana we made a reservation through Open Table. The next day I noticed I had several missed calls from what turned out to be the restaurant. Thinking there was a problem with my reservation I called them back on my way home from work. First I was asked how long we planned to stay because they had booked a reservation a short time after hours. (really?!) Through the course of the conversation it became evident the Gentleman had phoned the wrong person and we WERE the later reservation. At this point he asked if we'd be willing to come a little later to avoid a conflict with the earlier reservation.  Okay, sure.  I try not to be a difficult customer when I don't need to be.  So we bumped our reservation a bit.  Then I was told they wouldn't keep my reservation without a credit card on file.   As I was driving (don't worry I was on hands free) I said I'd phone back. The lady I spoke with later on explained that this was to debit my card $50 in the event we missed our reservation. We dine out frequently at both casual and fine dining restaurants and I have never been asked for a credit card deposit to hold my reservation. If this is something they require, then it should be listed on Open Table as opposed to spamming my cell phone all day long after the fact.  After expressing my concern over this practice she eventually offered to keep my reservation without a credit card.  A nice gesture perhaps, but against a policy that shouldn't exist in the first place.  As far as our actual dining experience goes, we found the service to be outstanding.  Our server was attentive, helpful, and friendly. I also found this to be the case on our previous visit. The serving staff really do a great job at Oceana.  There is also a decent wine list, though it is a little on the pricey side for what they offer.  Onto the food....  As mentioned before, the food here is hit and miss, and we got a bit of both on this latest visit.  While we waited to order our server brought out some bread and olive tapenade. The tapenade was plentiful and delicious!  If only we'd had more than about 3 or 4 tiny slices of bread to enjoy it with. The loaf of bread was very small and very hard to cut (only half of it had been pre-sliced).  Not much better than \"day old\" quality in my books, which is certainly not what I expect in a fine dining establishment.  For a starter I ordered the Kale Salad. A very simple dish but quite tasty.  I'd recommend it except it's a very small portion for the $9 they charge.  For our main course we ordered the Filet Minion and the 10oz New York steak.  The Filet Minion was \"good\".  No complaints there.  The 10oz New York - though ordered medium well - came out medium rare at best.  I ate it regardless as I didn't want the hassle of returning it. The flavour was mediocre and it wasn't a very good cut of meat at all. It was also the smallest \"10oz\" steak I've ever seen.  The vegetables etc. that came with our meals were very nicely done.  Overall, the mains would be put to shame by your local steakhouse, and just don't hold up to \"fine dining\" quality in any respect.  For desert we had the Tiramisu and the hand rolled Baklava.  The Tiramisu was quite tasty, so no major complaints there. With that said, it was not quite up to the quality level of other restaurants of this calibre.  The hand rolled Baklava was excellent!  Very nicely done. The portion was the big disappointment in this case.  Two tiny little pieces of, from what I could tell was the best thing on the menu.  Contrary to what some of the other reviewers have said, I don't mind the decor at all.  It's classy and romantic.   The atmosphere isn't contemporary but I don't think it's supposed to be.  In any case I'm not sure if we will visit Oceana again. The food just isn't on par with their prices or their competition, and the arrogance of attempting to charge me for a reservation is the final nail in the coffin.  With so many other fantastic options here in Calgary, these people really need to step up their game if they want to keep my business."}
{"text":"Our family of 4 went for a special dinner Valentines weekend. It was quite nice, but overpriced for what we were served. Food was good- but just ok, nothing spectacular. Service was slow- we had dirty plates on our table for almost 10 minutes after we were all 4 finished eating. The waitress at the other table offered a list of specials to her table & even options of oils or butter for bread... our table was not given any info on specials or any options for anything. I felt like maybe we were inconveniencing her in some way.  I highly doubt we would return, there are many other restaurants to choose from that woiuld make us feel more welcome and better bang for our buck."}
{"text":"Good sized portions.really fresh fish and nice atmosphere. I was surprised it was not busier on a friday night.  We live nearby , I could will be back. Good service and nice location on the river."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner to celebrate a special occasion and we were disappointed. We found it was average. The patio is great and the service was good. The atmosphere... hum... Some people were quite noisy: a lady seemed drunk and was very loud, another one was listening to music on her iphone and a guy started playing music as he came with an instrument. He played well for sure but I'm not sure it's what customers expect in this kind of restaurant.  The scallop & jumbo shrimp capri with linguini were good but a bit flavorless, it was missing something in the sauce. The cajun pan seared sea scallops were very fresh and very good but the sides were average... mash potatoes with scallops is definitely not the best match!!  The tiramisu is absolutely not a tiramisu.... at all.... And the chocolate cake is quite basic. So it's ok, but nothing special there and it's not to the level of its cost."}
{"text":"We went as a group of around 40 or so people as part of a staff Christmas Party/ Dinner at the beginning of December. The underground parking directly across the street was much welcomed as the weather was quite cold (worth 4 stars all on it's own!). I thought the ambiance was very nice, but not too formal. It allowed us as a group to feel very comfortable and relaxed to be ourselves. Also, everyone was super friendly!  The girlfriend and I shared our main courses...  Appetizers were: -Lobster Crustini                                -Baby Back Ribs                                -Mini Beef Wellingtons  Soup:                    -New England Clam Chowder  Main course:        -8 Oz Filet Mignon with Nova Scotia Sea Scallops                                  -Charbroiled Alaskan Halibut Filet with market fresh vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes                                  Drinks:                  -Caesars- ordered extra spicy  Dessert:               -Tiramisu-- Not the best Tiramisu ever, but still very rich and tasty...   ANALYSIS: All three appetizers were perfect! The Baby back ribs seemed out of place compared to the other menu items, but were very delicious. The New England clam chowder was served very warm, but not too hot. For someone who is not a big fan of soup, I actually quite enjoyed it.  I had ordered the Filet Mignon medium rare, and was not disappointed! Perfect to the second, and full of natural flavor.  The Scallops were very tender, but not too chewy or underdone. The Halibut was very moist, and melted in our mouths. Even the Caesars were perfect (And I am very, very picky about my Caesars!!) Note: although the drinks themselves were perfect, they were the only item that took forever to recieve once ordered  The food and the fast service, even though we were a large group, was outstanding. The serving staff were very organized and had the timing right on the money. Everything was served at the the right temperature, and the servers were very attentive and it was easy to get a hold of their attention.  Oh, and one more thing-- the plate presentation was spectacular! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I am all about supporting local businesses but this place needs Gordon Ramsay to come in and kick some ass. The highlight of the meal were the oysters on the half shell which were great but after that, things were just really average. I am fine with average when prices are moderate but this place is EXPENSIVE. An example - Seafood Marinara (Frutti De Mare) here is $26.00 where at other restaurants, similar quality and presentation is $8 to $10 cheaper. Wine service was terrible, usually the waiter follows service procedure which is a general tasting of the wine to ensure it is serviceable.  Not here though as the waiter ripped the foil, popped the cork and proceeded to fill up both wine glasses before sampling.  A major faux paus and left me wanting the $20 corkage fee back.  The Oysters Rockefeller were plain and uninspired and I got the sense that the hollandaise sauce was the powdered mix you get from the supermarket. The seafood quality was high but at these prices, there is no panache, creativity or sizzle put into their presentations.  On my colleagues plate, the Sea Bass entre the garlic mashed potatoes looked like they were served with an ice cream scoop which was mentioned by someone else. This might cut it in a hotel banquet setting but not at an upscale place like this. An entirely forgettable dining experience here."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Oceana... not only did a friend recommend it (which now has me seriously reconsidering our friendship!) but it's located in the building that formerly housed La Caille on the Bow... what was an old Calgary iconic establishment in the 80's, just West of Eau Claire Market on the bank of the Bow River... still a great looking upscale place from outside... alas, inside it's gone quite a ways downmarket (think Red Lobster meets The Keg)... and for restaurant prime time on a Friday, it was DEAD... maybe 12 people for a place that seats 100+.  As you do in a seafood restaurant, I stuck with the fish... the oysters on the half shell to start were ok other than the cocktail sauce they were served with.. a nice piece of grilled halibut (that was actually quite well prepared...) but it didn't seem to quite work with the ice cream scoop of mashed potatoes and some lazy grilled winter veg.  Service was ok but certainly nothing to write home about... I suppose if there was a good thing, it wasn't terribly expensive oysters, two mains and a bottle of decent white ran a little over $100... unfortunately, it looks like they will forever be stuck in the land of mediocre and ordinary; for me, I'd rather spend a few more dollars and go to Catch (or even the downstairs lounge at Catch)."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've been to Oceana, I think it's because it's just on the edge of downtown that it never dawns on me to come here. Opportunity arose when my manager suggested we dine here our team lunch.  My coworkers and I trekked over; it was a bit chilly on our walk so we were all relieved we got seated near the toasty fire place. I was in the mood for pasta so it worked out that their lunch menu featured a seafood linguine (scallops, shrimp and mussels in a garlic butter sauce). Everyone else got an array of seafood laden meals (except one coworker who got beef medallions which were surprisingly tasty)  The portions are moderate, quality of the food and service are top-notch. They do have daily lunch specials for about $20, but if you're thinking dinner it will cost you a pretty penny ($30-$40 range for just your entrée)"}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Oceanas has become my go to for business lunches and dinners. No matter what my clients or myself order we always walk away satisfied. The fish and chips are always top notch but i must say the eggs benedict on crab cakes are fantastic! I only wish the staff didn't look at me like i was the devil himself when i request fries as a side. And, if you provide bread...please just provide it. As of late the servers ask if you would like bread but if you accept you'd think you just asked them to do something painful. Take this particular issue out of the equation and the service, like the food, rates a 4 on my personal scale."}
{"text":"The complimentary bread came out cold, not just room temperature but actually cold! The salad was a waste of time, to the point of whoever made it should apologize to the dishwasher for making him/her clean the plate wasted on it! I could make a better salad at home. Just some greens like it came out of a packaged lettuce mix sold anywhere and other than the rare piece of what I believe to be fennel there was nothing in it! You can't completely rely on the dressing to make a salad appetizing and with the dressing they had it might as well have been a generic store bought dressing. The lobster bisque had no lobster flavour or any discernible lobster in it at all. I always believed there should be actual pieces of lobster in a lobster bisque, guess not. Both the fish dish and the steak dish was under seasoned, at least the potatoes were ok.   The best and only good part of the meal came in the form of ice cream that arrived with the apple pie. Wonderfully rich and filled with vanilla flavour it was great. Unfortunately it was the only actually good thing we had all night.   In summary don't have the Big Taste salad or bisque or cod or steak! A very disappointing evening, Oceana you've lost 2 people for good! Thoroughly dissatisfied!"}
{"text":"Looks like a really nice place but there food wasn't the best. Oysters on the half shell were warm, steak was dry.. nice place but could use better food."}
{"text":"Took our Admin group out for lunch on Admin Professionals day and a great meal was had by all!  Great service, friendly atmosphere, all round great meal.  For reference, the Fisherman's Platter is fresh, delicious and a lot of food.  Other favorites are the Arctic Char and the Halibut Salad.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I have many meals at Oceana, including business dinners and celebration dinners.  The food and service have been consistently excellent.  They have a private room for special functions and meetings.  The scallops are the best I have had.  The shrimp are very tasty.  The seafood pasta is excellent.  The beef is terrific as well.  The fish is fresh and brought in regularly.  Quite frankly this is the best seafood in Calgary.   You need to try it and make your own decision."}
{"text":"When I told the waitress that there were bones in my chowder she said 'that is normal', then I mentioned that it was also cold... She said she was sorry.   Well.. That was the beginning of a mediocre meal.  I had chosen the $35 dinner special; chowder, arctic char and creme brûlée.  Fish was fine, veggies were cold and the mashed potatoes were plated using an ice cream scoop.  My desert was flavorless and contained something hard and white...  To be honest, the potatoes were the best part of the meal.    The kids ordered pasta ranging from 26 to $35.  They finished their drinks and were never offered another.  Our table of 8 ate the bread we were offered, and although we asked for more, it didn't arrive until immediately before dessert was served.  The pear flambé wasn't flamed, and was so sweet that a 13 yo boy could not eat it. Apparently the chocolate cake was absolutely spectacular.  Our bill was $456.00.    Pretty location, pretty waitress, pretty awful dinner at an absolutely criminal price."}
{"text":"Very good food.  I went here for a work dinner and we had family style Italian food.  The filet mignon was excellent and the scallops we had as appetizers were great.  There was plenty of food to go around and the atmosphere was awesome too."}
{"text":"The food was okay. I went as part of Big Taste, and the lobster bisque was amazing. The prawn pasta was ok. The really disappointing part was the service. I went with a group of friends, and our table of 4 young professional women was treated quite poorly. When we walked in the hostess saw us, sat the group that was before us, and came back to help the people who came in after us. That couple pointed out that we were actually next and the hostess just said \"well, do you still want me to seat you?\" making the other couple feel quite uncomfortable as well. We insisted they continue being seated. Sadly our waitress wasn't much better. She was clearly not impressed serving us, and made us rearrange our own plates, etc. She wasn't overly chatty which would have been fine if we hadn't been able to hear her chatting up the more mature tables around us. The worst part by far was when we received our bill. It came as one amount, and she expected us to quickly do the math to split the total as she waited. She finally decided to give us a moment to calculate, reminding us to \"include gratuity and gst\" before walking away. We calculated our totals and each paid separately. Simple math calculations could tell her that our bill was paid plus her tip, but she told me to open the calculator function on my phone and proceeded to tell me to add up each of the amounts we paid to ensure we had paid enough. It was completely insulting. We all have university degrees, good jobs, and were dressed well. We just happened to be under 30. We're a polite group too! We all worked in stores and restaurants during school, and I get that there's bad days. But this was beyond that. I can speak for all of us when I say we won't be going back."}
{"text":"HUGE WINE PRICES ! HUGE FOOD PRICES! HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!  it was our first time here and we came with a groupon.   The feeling was we were 'on the cheap' by the staff.  Decor is so old and dated.  Servers wander around aimlessly ...sloppily attired for an alleged high end restaurant.  more concerned about their iphones and chattering with eachother. the bread came out not just cold but ICE COLD!  i see another reviewer had the same problem.  Food was mediocre.  Should not be advertised in a fine dining catergory.  Gordon  Ramsey .. where are you ?  This place needs YOU!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other review. Decor was trying REALLY hard to be upscale but failed... seemed to me a little like a nightclub with it's lights on?! (if that makes sense).... of course I had gone for lunch... perhaps at dinner, the darker lighting would hide some flaws??  Food:  Oyster Rockefeller - I disliked a lot. Felt it was dry, and not cohesive. Calamari - it was ok, nothing above normal Halibut salad - Halibut was pretty good. Sole filet meal - very buttery, tender... it was ok, again nothing earth shattering.  Luckily, we had a GC so it lowered the price of the bill which was nice.    Conclusion: Overpriced, wanting to be high-end, but not succeeding."}
{"text":"Excellent service, uneven food, decent portion size, and strangling prices.  Nothing wrong with being an expensive restaurant, but you'd better be really worth that money.  In my personal case, we absolutely enjoyed the service - super polite, accommodating, helpful, flexible, useful. Total attention, no nuisance - and very relaxed. I loved that none of the people serving us were making \"important\" faces and striking fake \"we are expensive\" acts while helping us. Thanks guys, and respect for being professionals.  Food... Well, here is the gotcha. I loved the menu - an interesting Mediterranean twist of a seafood, with some quite original plates. And mostly - but just mostly! - quality of these plates was simply great. Worth every penny.  However, talking $$$$ and bringing a salad with dull, \"second day in a row out of the fridge\" leaves? Really?? Why??? That was a big fail. And there were a few other items of \"this could be better for a bill size\" type.  Not really fatally disappointed, I would like to give Oceana four stars - I do believe that raising the quality of food to 100% is something totally possible. I'd like to give them another try one day, and will update my review accordingly.  I can absolutely suggest you giving this place a try as well - the more opinions, the better. And you would definitely get something upscale-ish. As much as this level is generally represented in Calgary.  PS: Oh, and their parking is a joke. And a bad one, really. Just so you know and plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Came here for Calgary Big Taste on a weekday night with my cousin and her 1 yr old child.  First off, wonderful staff! They were super friendly and patient.  The lobster bisque is delicious, actually have lobster meat inside.  I ordered the cod loin with laksa broth. Cod was cooked perfectly, didn't over cook at all! The broth, yum, perfectly spiced! Dessert I ordered the pear flambe, that was too sweet for my liking."}
{"text":"Really good... The halibut was very good and healthy.. The mix plates to share are very very big!!.. But they are good as well... The service was friendly too...  I really enjoyed this place and I would go back.."}
{"text":"Been to this place a dozen times or so, dating back to its roots on 4th Street. Greek Salad, Clam chowder, Halibut and chocolate lava cake. Always good, always walk away feeling that i made a great choice for dinner. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Definitely trying to hard with the decor but i liked the place. I was in Calgary visiting my son and i had bought a Groupon to try this restaurant. Because of time constraints we could not do dinner but we did lunch instead.  The location of the place is great. in a great area of Calgary, very Downtown and cool.  There were only a few people in the restaurant that day for lunch, we were seated by a window, which had a nice view on the outside so it was nice.  They had lunch specials, which is what we had, my son had the Salmon and rice pilaf and i had the peppercorn steak with mash potatoes and salad. Everything was solid. Our waiter though, was not overly friendly, but after spending time in Calgary i learned Canadians (maybe only Calgarians) are very cold, so this did not bother us.  He was though quick and service was ok overall.  Now the only complain i have is that when the check came and i informed the waiter we had a Groupon, he kinda made a face and proceeded to tell me that the Groupons were only good for entrees, or for dinner and i could not use it for lunch.  I told him that i had made a reservation before hand and i had mentioned the Groupon to the manager and he had said there was no problem. He said he had to \"go check\" and came back after 10 minutes and said \"there will be no problem to use the Groupon\". So that was pretty lame on his part, since the point of Groupon is to get people to try different venues and they can in turn get new and recurring customers.  I have to admit we were both pleased with the food, but if it was not for Groupon i do not think it'd have tried this place as the reviews were not very positive.  Overall, it was a good experience and i will likely be back to Oceana when i go back to Calgary."}
{"text":"Love Oceana!  We haven't been to Oceana for a while and decided to pop in for a birthday lunch.  We ordered: -Grilled Octopus for the appetizer - So tender and so delicious!  That squirt of lemon makes the octopus sing!  So having this the next time we are at Oceana! - Chilean Sea Bass with Parmesan Cheese crust - Very delicious dish.  That Chilean Sea Bass just makes my mouth water when I'm typing this!  - Arctic Char - Due to a diet restriction, this was specially made with no sodium at all and it tasted so good! - Orange Roughy - Delicious and moist fish dish. - Prawns - Wolfed that down so quickly!  Giant prawns!  Dessert:  3 layer Chocolate Cake - courtesy of Oceana."}
{"text":"Three stars?! Gimme a break---one of the best seafood dinners I've had in recent memory. Great ambiance too!  Awesome fried oysters, Parmesan encrusted sea bass, and sautéed pickerel  were all heroic---not to mention the best sweet potato fries EVER!!!  If you find yourself in Calgary make sure you try Oceana!!!"}
