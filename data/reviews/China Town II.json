{"text":"a few things to say about this place.

1)  there is nowhere on earth that rice would naturally be that shade of yellow/orange.  crayola is even scared of that.  with rice so bright it possibly glows in the dark, you have to wonder what it does to your insides.

2)  so this is cleveland's china town district, huh?  only 600 square feet?

yeah, comedy would have been just writing that last sentence.  and that's it.

don't come here if you want some authentic delicious asian cuisine.  but if you're out and about and want something fried and chinese like, this is the place.

felt a little dirty, though.  i'm just sayin.  but you don't want to think about that as you're picking up your to go order."}
{"text":"Now that I've been here twice, with excellent results, I am adding another star.

Tried the vegetable lo-mein...deliciously greasy noodles of the gods.  We also tried the chicken with broccoli, kung pao chicken, and of course that yummy, scallion-laden wonton soup again.

The woman behind the counter was very courteous and quickly screamed our orders behind her so the cooks could get cookin.'

No schmutz on the forks this time.

Pints of food (instead of quarts) proved to be plenty, and we still didn't finish everything.

Also, a relaxed, community feel as all the Sunday night lazies like myself wandered in in pajama pants and hooded sweatshirts wanting their Chinese food.  It kinda reminded me of being in college."}
{"text":"Before eating here last night I have written off fast Chinese food forever. I wouldn't eat any of it from suburban Chinese restaurants due to the chewiness of the meat and the overall nastiness of the entire dish. 

I had the crab rangoon-- just OK, egg roll-- delicious, greasy and exactly what the doctor ordered. For my entree I did the hunan chicken (no onion) with white rice-- best I can remember having and some chicken lo mein-- very nice in comparison to other places. Here's the kicker, chicken & tostones-- fried chicken, and fried plantains. This was surprisingly delicious and was so cheap, please try. 

The next time I'm in the mood for some greasy, fast, Chinese food this is where I will go. Can't wait to try the wonton soup, it sounds yummy."}
{"text":"Good for the hungry, not for your diet.  Get the fried rice when possible.  Walk up is best, menu is common but the food satisfies during the cold and enteral winter that is Cleveland."}
{"text":"Fast, but not very friendly.  I ordered chicken chow mein but received chicken chop suey.  No delivery also! The highlights were the triple crown I ordered for myself and the gigantic, very tasty egg roll. The fried rice had lots of tasty bits mixed in too."}
{"text":"Cheap and will satisfy your Chinese junk food craving. I noticed that they wait until you arrive to cook your food if you phone it in, so I just walk up and order. I have not had to wait more than about 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Food was banginn! The orange chicken and vegetable Lo mein were both amazing definitely ordering his place more often"}
{"text":"This place could not be worse!!!  Started out bad, and went down hill from there.  I called in my order of 6 spare ribs, and a small pork lo mein.  When I pulled into the parking lot and left my car, I was immediately approached by a guy asking for spare change.  My patented reply of \"sorry I cannot help you\" was met with a response of \"that's how people get hurt\".  Really???? On my way to get Chinese I need to be threatened?????  I don't blame the take out shop for this, but I certainly blame the plaza owner who is all too quick to tow peoples cars who either by design or error park in the plaza when shopping in the West Side Market.  Get some security dude!.   The plaza owner is by no means a friend of Ohio City.  Sorry, I digress.
Got my ribs and lo mein and could not wait to chow down.....Opening my spare ribs which were in the same sized pint container as my lo mein I had to wonder what the hell they were???  About 16 1\" pieces of something that tasted nothing like pork ribs.  Maybe pork knuckles, or pork toes, but definitely, definitely NOT pork ribs.  Wish I knew how to post pictures of that mystery meat on Yelp.   After the spare rib experience i was in no mind to even try the lo mein.  That went in the disposal.  In closing Stay Away - Stay Far Away!"}
{"text":"It's good if you're hungry and in a rush for some Chinese food. From order to them actually having it ready is about 8 minutes on average, their filet mignon egg rolls are actually really good. Not much seating inside, it's mostly a pick up and go place. Affordable lunch specials, your serving size is good, selection of food is like any other Chinese spot."}
{"text":"Had their General Tso's dish for lunch. Nice sized portion for the price."}
{"text":"Don't do it to yourself. They will never get another dime out of me and I mean that. First, the woman that answered the phone spoke very limited and broken English so she didn't understand the order. She talked over me in stating she understood the order and still got it wrong. Went to pick up my food and not only was it wrong, she lied about what was in the order (never mind a customer potentially having a food allergy). I didn't check the order until I returned to the office because I was pissed that didn't give me the proper change and I had to go back. 
The biggest tip off in places like this that they are ripping you off is they don't give a receipt. I went back to get my receipt and my correct change and she calculated the order again minus the amount I gave her and the correct total. Its just the total excluding the money tendered.
The food and service are not good enough for this kind of mistake or behavior. It wouldn't hurt for the Board to check this place for cleanliness or at least people should post then they are not given the correct change."}
{"text":"Going to agree with Tim S, great when you're hungry and other places are closed. I've been coming here for at least fifteen years and I swear they're open way later some nights than their posted hours (which I can't say for a certain \"late night\" sandwich shop on W25th that always closes early). 

You get what you expect, cheap Chinese food, filling and usually works well reheated the next morning. 

None of the people speak english very well, but that's OK. I like putting fresh squeezed lemon juice on my egg rolls, and they always give me one when I ask.  Definitely a good, go-to place. Solid."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a fan. Not 'Yay!'

This is exactly the kind of take out Chinese food that I want for exactly the price I want to pay for it. Is it the best in the city? Absolutely not. Is it the greasy, tasty numbered-menu Asian fare you're expecting from a place with generic food pictures on the wall? Bingo.  I can only speak for what I've had so far: General Tso, Pork Egg Rolls and Wonton Soup. I think I spent $10 and I had three full meals worth of food. All were spot-on. It's exactly what you expect it to be. 

Cleanliness is a bit on the iffy side but honestly, I'm fine with it. I've worked in enough restaurants to know what it's really like and what most places get away with. The food was great and it didn't make me sick. Cool."}
{"text":"This little, Chinese take-out joint falls perfectly in line with my occasional laziness when it comes to making din-din. 

You know what I mean. It's a cold night, your fridge has a wide variety of condiments, but no food--basically, it's getting late and you can't eat just ketchup. (Not that you've tried...)

China Town is close to my place, has that traditional, quick-fix, Chinese taste that you can trust. It's not super special, but damn if it doesn't hit the spot! It's greasy, even when you order vegetarian dishes, and that's how you want it. 

Some stand-outs: the wonton soup is actually really tasty! Lots of scallions and tons more wontons than you usually get from other places. The broth has that good, salty flavor, but not to the point of raising your blood pressure through the roof. 

Also, the service is always honest and sweet. Just this last time I came in they gave us free drinks for no reason. They really do bust their tushies around there to give you great service. 

Might I recommend that you 1) Order your food to go and enjoy it at home  (with a location like that and late night hours, it tends to attract creepers and men who are most likely picturing you naked) and 2) Go for the white rice. Their fried rice isn't their strong point, in my opinion. 

Good, cheap, typical Chinese food. Open late, courteous--now if I could only convince them to deliver."}
{"text":"This little joint has a nice sized menu, but not very quality or satisfying. After recently moving, I've been trying to find a new go to Chinese Restraunt. I ate at the Great Wall and was similarly letdown, but was hoping this would be my new Chinese food spot. I order the beef with broccoli lunch special. It came with a side of pork fried rice. I'm personally not a fan of this style fried rice. I also order the crab Rangoon's and an order of steamed dumplings. The Rangoon sauce was on point, but this is one of those places where they stuff a bunch of cream cheese in the center, and hope you don't notice there's no crab. The dumplings were too doughy and the stuffing was no good. The conversation I had with another costumer while waiting for my meal was better than my meal, and the staff is very friendly. I like that the kitchen is open and you can watch them cook your food. If you're up for good company and bad food, this is the place for you! 
I took the vegetables out of my food and made my own white rice at home in an attempt to not waste the whole thing."}
{"text":"Closest Chinese joint near Tremont.  They have pretty good wonton soup and shirmp chips.  I question the cleanliness...dude cooks with flip flops on..lol.  Its good hangover food (which is often how i roll).  If there was a different one close by I would switch..but for now..Míngtin jiàn!!"}
{"text":"They messed up my order (the man taking orders on the phone barely speaks / understand English) and then when fixed it, overcharged me for the incorrect thing so I just left anyway. They were fixing several other people's orders while I was waiting for them to fix mine. They were also rude when I told them nicely I did not order sesame chicken, which doesn't even sound like chicken lo mein. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"this might be the worst chinese food i've had in cleveland, and thats saying a lot. i've never seen lower quality chicken. i'm going to bed hungry tonight instead of eating this food."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty good the couple times I've tried it. Tonight I tried a new dish, vegetable chow fun which was thin white rice noodles mixed with vegetables. It was a big serving for less than $8 -- I'll probably cook up more vegetables with my leftovers but my dinner was good. I grabbed a couple packets of their hot sauce and added them before I ate it. I wanted to leave a review since it seems like so long since they had one - it's good. Oh, 50 cent fee for credit card -- I think because I was under $10 but either way, they didn't tell me, they just changed the total when I handed over my card."}
{"text":"rat infestation!
my boyfriend informed me they have rats running around he repaired some machinery, he told me they were dead rats stuck under the fridge the guy hacked it off with a cooking knife i cant believe it!. i already called in the health inspector please dont eat here for ur own safety they know they have rats and im ashamed I have ate her also!"}
