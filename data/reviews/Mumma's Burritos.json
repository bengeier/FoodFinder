{"text":"Seriously, what is wrong with this place? I gave it a second shot from a bad first experience, and it was even worse. The food looks like a blind or maybe someone who DESPISES me made the food. I used ubereats. Learned my lesson. Eat here if u like to waste your money."}
{"text":"Very nice burrito joint have been there more often then before. Should try their smothered burrito really worth getting it. They even have signature burritos now which have different unique flavor that won't make you bored eating it everyday. Very organized place with excellent staff... 
Quick in service than other burrito places. Also have LLBO license so now one can enjoy their fav beer. Their evening and weekend specials are really cool $7.99 for any size any meat burrito with a canned drink and chips and salsa cannot beat that plus the over all experience you get."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie. Only had this place the one time. They delivered which is awesome. Had a burrito which I ordered chicken and beef mix. Was nice and not dry. Didn't kill my stomach. Had a quesadilla with the works on it. Really good pink sauce they served with it. And an order of nachos, which could of used more cheese in my opinion. Oh and the salsa wasn't bad but tasted different from any salsa I ever tried. Will be my new Mexican food place for sure"}
{"text":"i love this place! The staff are friendly and inviting, the food is great and the prices are affordable! They also serve alcohol, which is a huge bonus!"}
{"text":"To start off the review ill name some of the pros that enticed me to enter in the first place. Colorful design, signs that show special and location were al evident. The interior is very nice and clean (restaurants fairly new).

we were met with some servers who were certainly fast paced. I do like the efficiency however It was hard to hear when the words are meshed together. We ended up getting a steak burrito bowl, veggie nachos, chips and salsa and a drink. Now the bowl was ...edible? however steak lacked alot of flavor, the ingredients looked as though they were not finely cut (ex. Large pieces of red onion overpowered the whole thing) The nachos were minimal (they were however only 5.99), it felt like it was nachos that you would make at home in a quick rush. I do not see this place doing well just due to the lack of flavour in the food.  

A big let down for a mexican foodie like myself."}
{"text":"We had this food delivered and the food was very good! I would buy again. The only complaint I have is the quantity was not sufficient."}
{"text":"We don't get Mexican food often so this was a rare treat. The food was really good but the best thing about our experience was the service. The lone server, despite being fairly busy, was super friendly and took the time to answer our questions while still speedily getting the job done. We were very impressed."}
{"text":"I finally got to try Mumma's Burrito as I was always discouraged from coming in due to parking and being next to Sheridan College. I ordered a beef burrito and I was kind of disappointed. It really was not anything special with regards to taste and portions, but I really wasnt surprised as I felt like the person at the counter really wanted to push me to add more toppings to my burrito when I clearly stated what I wanted TWICE. In addition, the layout for the front counter made little sense as I went to the front counter to place my order, pay towards the right side , and pick up my food on the opposite side. 

I will compliment them on being LLBO, their prices were somewhat reasonable, and I received my food much faster in comparison to Burrito Boyz. 

I am pretty sure I wont be returning as I am picky about meat having flavor and quality ingredients (beans was way more sauce than beans)."}
{"text":"Such nice employees , really friendly , they know how to keep a conversation going while making your food. I got a beef burrito with a Mexican pop and it was delicious ! Compared to mucho burrito , this place is way better !"}
{"text":"It was edible... But I won't return. Had a chicken burrito and chicken quesadilla. I ate the burrito but it was not enjoyable at all.  Half of girlfriends quesadilla is still in the fridge two days later and that's after K ate 1/4... I don't think she liked it. Keep going east until your hit Burrito Boys in Vaugh."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. I was sceptical to try this place because of the reviews. However I really enjoyed my burrito bowl. I got the shredded beef. All the topping looked fresh and tasted fresh as well. The salsa wasn't that spicy. I would go back."}
{"text":"Just had a burrito and their fry-chos it is one of the best I've had!! 
I've been vying to get her for the longest time and it was worth the wait. I will be coming back as long as the food keeps comin like this.
I'm going to tell so many ppl about this place. Just bloody amazing!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. But the flavors were unimpressive, the spice level from each burrito where varying and a lot of the taste was overshadowed by their overly generous amount of green onions. The meat was pulled steak, pulled chicken etc. So you got very small flakes of meat, very disappointing. The taco shell was stale and chewy, like Tostito chips you forgot out over night, simply put it was disgusting. The tacos were incredibly small and unfortunately we all felt the boxed taco kits from the grocery store were more flavorful.
The chicken quesadilla was more green onions and cheese, next to no meat to be seen. This won't be a repeat order, as I can make better myself. A complete waste of $63 for this skip the dishes experience. Never again. 
They get 2 stars just for the Jarritos drink variety and that's something they never cooked.
I literally sat here pulling out huge chunks of green peppers from the burritos... not impressed.
I hate to say this about any restaurant, because generally there's something good... but I truly could not find a single item other than the pop. Stick to Old El Paso kits from your grocery store, because you'll get better quality food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch. They have $6 burrito of the day lunch special. With a drink comes to around $8.25. The first time I went was beef burrito. The second time fiery chicken. The burritos were good. Typical of most burrito places I have been to."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Good Mexican food. THEY DELIVER(on orders $20 or more)! Good prices for a delivery. Better prices at their place. Vegetarian food too. Very kind lady on the phone to help me as a first time customer with NO idea how to say Mexican foods. They take credit cards or cash at delivery. No debit for delivery. 

Long story:
10:06 AM
I need Mexican food...but I don't wanna get up... 
I get on yelp, find like 3 places and none deliver or can't deliver for less than $100 worth of food.
Call this place expecting to starve because I'm too lazy to get up and go to taco bell. 
Ring. Ring. I fart. Ring.
They pick up. They help me order. 
ORDERED:
Vegetarian burrito and a few bean and cheese quesadillas plus an energy drink.
The door bell rings. I roll out of bed and tumble down the stairs. 
Open the door and say
\"Yeah so the tv busted up and I can't watch game of thrones. Fix it up man I got warranty.\"
Random brown guy at my door just unpacks some food containers and I just go silent and pay the man. A tip of course. 
I eat the food and well now I'm falling asleep and losing my gusto for writing any further. Good food. Energy drink only lasts so long so I'm on the road to zzzzzzzzzzzzz."}
{"text":"I used to come here everyday ( literally every single day when I lived on the school's residence) as it is conveniently located close to the Sheridan Davis Campus. I love their burritos words cant even explain. I always used to get the naked chicken and it definitely was the best meal I've had in college. It's like I know I am eating good when I eat here. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the staff have always been friendly and provide great service. I suggest a tip jar! The burritos are great as well, very fresh. Cheaper than chipotle and tastes just as good if not better. They have a loyalty card as well where you can collect stamps for free food. Who doesn't love a free burrito. I've only ever had the burritos and burrito bowls which are great. They're spicy chicken is crazy spicy if you're into that. An employee let me try it which was great bc I couldn't handle the heat and got the regular chicken. I've suggested this place to my friends and they love it too. Check it out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is tucked behind the Sheridan Davis campus in a small strip mall. There is a parking lot but it fills up quickly.

You can take out, dine in or order from Skip The Dishes. The staff here is really nice and the food is terrific.

I always order the the Devil's burrito (vegeterian level 1 heat). Its delicious and the hot sauce is ghost pepper sauce. My family orders the vegeterian burritos and they love rhem. This will be one of our go to places from now on."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Mumma's Burritos.  I've never heard of this chain but was in the area so thought I'd give them a try.

I ordered a large chicken burrito combo ... burrito, pop and tortilla chips.  My burrito had rice, black beans, chicken, mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, corn, salsa and burrito sauce.  I love burritos and this was a yummy one.  They quickly heat up the wrap, then put on your ingredients (there are lots to choose from) and then grill it.  The chicken and rice were hot and everything else was cool, which made for an interesting contrast.

The fellas working behind the counter were friendly.

I'd stop in at this chain if I was near one again."}
{"text":"My brother and I finally had a chance to try this place after driving by many times. We went on a Wednesday night which meant it was chicken burrito day! A regular size burrito for $6.49. Each day has a different special (please see the picture attached for details by day).

We were greeted by a very friendly young man who was very helpful and accommodating. He also informed us that there is delivery which is great news.

Burritos come in small or regular sizes. It was tough to finish the regular size so I may do the small next time. Toppings are very fresh and you have the option of whole wheat or white tortilla. Avocado is extra so with tax for the 2 chicken burritos came to $16.81. Not bad! The burritos were still nice and warm when we got home and we thoroughly enjoyed it.

They also have steak, fiery chicken, and a vegetarian option. Other people there also ordered the nachos which looked good. 

Price, service and quality were great. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Put a very minimal amount of chicken in the burrito.. Plus, not so much variation of meat when we got there. Gave them two stars since they had daily promotions and not a long wait at the line unlike any burrito joints"}
{"text":"I came here on the way to my sister's house. I was craving a burrito, but I thought I'd try something besides Burrito Boyz. The seating was a huge upgrade from your typical \"take your burrito and gtfo\" setting. I got the steak burrito and it was alright. Not as plump and dense as I would've expected, but the flavour was on par with Burrito Boyz. I was a bit disappointed that they wouldn't honour the \"Free chips and salsa\" check-in deal. I showed it to two different employees and they both were unaware of such a deal and were very hesitant to honour it."}
{"text":"Nice people, nice location, stale chips, not \"real Mexican\", generic menu, empty place, and the price was higher than the price here on Yelp. Unless you are nearby and need to eat a mediocre burrito, you are better off going to Burrito Boyz where everything is hopping... or better yet, drive to Buffalo and have Mexican food made by Mexicans."}
