{"text":"I am really surprised to read that many glorious reviews. The food was mediocre, and their fish was not fresh, to say the least."}
{"text":"Top-quality sushi. I don't eat there as much as I would like to because it's a like pricey, but totally worth it. The scallop sushi just melts in your mouth..."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! Affordable too?! I love it!! This is my new favourite sushi place. A very small but tidy and clean space. They have two small tables for 4 ppl to sit, which is great. Their spicy salmon rolls are yummy! I love their miso soup too! Not like those overly salty ones at Ayce sushi places. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Ordered Sushi #8 and Sushi Tsuka for two people. Bill came to $50 and change. That would be pricey in a sit down place, but this was takeout from a hole-in-the-wall. The food was fresh and the fish was pretty good, but I can get comparable quality from any number of other places for literally half the price and will do that in future. I won't go back until they lower their prices."}
{"text":"What? Japanese owners? I love it. Had to try this place since it was nearby and had great reviews. The service was very friendly.  Very small, not for dining but fabulous for take out. Got to practice my Japanese while I waited. Ordered the hamachi nigiri, spicy tuna roll and soft shell crab roll. Devine. This is my new go-to sushi take out joint!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the best sushi takeout place in all of Toronto. 

Tomo is a great host and often tries to accommodate his customers as much as possible. The quality is top notch - you will not find anything better."}
{"text":"Simple, no frills shop with fantastic sashimi. Service is quick and friendly. Slightly unusual hours, so I sometimes call ahead to make sure they're open. Great for takeout and parties."}
{"text":"Today, Zack was all, \"WE GOTTA GO TO THIS PLACE.\" Our plan was to walk from work, which to me was INSANE because it was the first disgusting winter day of the season, and the restaurant is located west of Bathurst (Sushi 930, get it? 930 King). \"WE'RE FOOLS,\" I thought. \"I can go across the street for sushi,\" I thought. Well, I'm a pantywaist.

As soon as I saw the glistening trays of fresh sushi, I knew we were in for something above par. My vegetarian maki set (yam roll, cucumber roll, veg dragon roll) was expertly prepared and paired with REAL pickled ginger. Although delicious, I gazed upon Zack's Sushi #8 with jealousy and fishlust, for it seemed to me to be the freshest looking fish I've seen in this city aside from my LEGENDARY meal at Hiro. Sampling his california roll and white tuna instantly brought me back to that summer I lodged in a pineapple under the sea.

So yes, it was worth the bitter winter winds. The prices are a little higher than average (does vegetarian maki have to cost $15?!), and there are only 2 tables, but pick it up and devour in the comfort of your own home. 2nd best sushi I've had in Toronto, for sures."}
{"text":"So after reading all the great reviews for this place I decided to give it a try.  It is conveniently across the street from where I live.  My husband and I ordered Sushi #8 and the Sashimi Sakura.  The Sushi #8 was good, we liked the variety of sushi we got, however the roll that was included was just okay.  The Sashimi on the other hand was really good, a fresh selection of fish.   We got approximately 17 pieces, however the girl on the phone said it usually comes with about 13 to 14 pieces.  The Sashimi came with a bowl of rice as well and we received two miso soups, however we did not order the miso soups, not sure if each meal maybe came with one.  Our bill came to about $45 which is pretty reasonable considering the amount of fish we received.  Overall a really good sushi place, we will definitely be ordering from here again.  

Note: The hours on yelp and on their website are not correct.  They do not open until 5pm on Saturdays and they close from 3 - 5pm Tuesday to Friday for prep.  I recommend calling ahead to see if they're open and to call in your order, ours took about 35 minutes to prepare."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi I've had in Toronto. It's delicious and the fish is very fresh. Even though it's only take-out, I definitely recommend making the trip over."}
{"text":"If you go to somewhere north(maybe J-town or Taro's Fish), of course you are able to get good quality of sushi/sashimi. But it's just so far to get there for me. Sushi 930 is located by Bathurst*King West which is very easy access from downtown. Their sashimi is very fresh and best sashimi I tried in Toronto. When I have a bad day, I order food from here. Their service and food always remind me home(Japan). It is pricey but it's worth trying! The other day, I ordered \"Sashimi Sakura\". It had a variety of sashimi: Uni, real crab meat, scollops, squid and lots more. Once you try their sashimi, you won't want to try the other sushi places. But if you are looking for something cheap, it's not a place to go."}
{"text":"what i liked, 
the spicy salmon maki, thick cuts of salmon. 

what needs improvement,

a bit neater preparation in the maki, falls apart
more rice vinegar for the sushi rice
dryer and crisper nori
shrimp tempura roll cold, if freshly fried it should be warmer
spicy version of the rolls are $1.50 more, bit much for sriracha and mayo imho

the spicy salmon maki was good, prices a bit higher than normal for sushi takeout."}
{"text":"Its pretty good. The sushi is fresh and the combos have a decent variety. The lack of decent lunch specials makes this place less attractive as someone who works in the area and is usually looking for lunch though."}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab sushi and sashimi take out in the neighborhood. I live in Liberty Village. Fish is fresh and good quality. Staff are friendly and service is great."}
{"text":"Signs of why this place is super good.

- I have friends who come from as far north as Bloor to just get take out
- even though at work my department has other options for sushi nearby, this one is the number one choice
- they remember mine and colleagues regular lunch orders each time as soon as we walk through the door
- super sweet service 
- it is the closest place to where I live and my go to place for sushi
- they do great lunch combos for less than $15 

Okay so like I said already my review is a combination of my views and a bunch of other people I have eaten with from here. They have like two tables so it is more of a take out option which is fine as both my house and work are close to here. 

Of the hundreds of times I have been there they have always been consistent in service and quality of food. There are not many places in Toronto that can do that."}
{"text":"The sushi here is great. For people that really enjoy sushi made by Japanese people, this is the place. The sushi is fresh and my favorite order is maki roll. Great place!"}
{"text":"So I'm a descendant from Japan and I don't eat fish. Yeah, it's weird but hey, I grew up eating mac n' cheese with hotdog weiners. I do, however, know when I'm eating some authentic japanese food. I tried this place out because I've heard good things about it.
I ordered the vegetarian maki. The guy who took my $16 (it's pretty steep for vegetarian but after devouring it, I won't complain too much) asked if I ate fish and after i replied with a \"negative\". He said \"me too\" and I asked \"oh rearry?\" and he said \"nah, just kidding\" haha! you so funny man! 
There was a special on the board for a shitake & avocado roll that wasn't on the menu so it's probably a good idea to ask if there are any deals for that day. 
My meal came with a somewhat bland miso soup. It wasn't the worst miso soup I've had. Just a simple version. The vegetarian maki contained a \"dragon roll\" (avocado neatly wrapped on the outside - it looked pretty), a couple of cucumber rolls with shiso leaves and a yam roll (which isn't covered in batter so if you want grease, you're not getting it with this order). Normally, vegetarians get the shaft when it comes to vegetable rolls. We get stuck with cucumber and avocado and if we're lucky, shiitake. Sure, this combo had cucumber and avocado but it was done with flavour! yes, not just plain rice rolled around a piece of cucumber! The shiso leave added a nice touch and the rice was not gooey and bland. 
This place reminded me of Sushi Marche that's in the east end on Queen. I'm sure the fish sushi here is excellent, judging by just eating cucumber, yam and avocado!"}
{"text":"I'm going to have to agree with the 2 and 3 star reviews on here. 

I wasn't impressed at all with this place, nor was I impressed with the food. I usually consider sushi as \"food made by Japanese wizards\", but this time it just felt thrown together for how long I waited..

The order took over 20 mins to prepare for 2 maki sets, which were priced considerably HIGHER than some of the best spots in the area (Raaw or Koja, for instance).

To be fair, the vegetarian maki set was actually really well done with the flayed avocado on the top and the lettuce bed of garnish, but the salmon/tuna maki set looked like they just threw it into the styrofoam container in a big damned hurry... Additionally, they were the POOREST CUTS of fish I have tasted in a sushi dish to date... Boo.

Your safest bet is to take a 15-minute stroll over to one of the 3 other sushi gems in Liberty Village instead (From high-to-low : Raaw, Koja, InJapan) and get your fix there. It's cheaper, and miles beyond what you'll be left with here..."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant but unfortunately the food wasn't all that great. When I first walked in there and saw the prices, I said to myself, \"It must be super good here!\" I went home with giddy expectation, alas, I am left with an empty plastic with disappointment on my taste buds. 

I ordered the Maki Roll Set, which includes the California roll, spicy tuna roll, and spicy salmon roll. Or at least I think it was supposed to be spicy! It's a subtle hint of spiciness, which I'm not impressed by. Nice and fresh ingredients, but nothing so special that I'd pay $18 again. 

I'm a bit sad. I recently just moved to Toronto from Vancouver, and I've been craving for some sushi. The first sushi place is here, which left me wondering why, why is the price so expensive for this ordinary maki set. The miso soup was too bland, and makis just weren't true to their price calling. I don't mind paying more for extraordinary sushi, but this just wasn't it."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi at fantastic prices. I'd rather head straight to this place than any of the eat and dash sushi joints on bloor although the location is slightly out of the way for me.

The fish is reasonably fresh here, and you get a good variety/amount in some of the combo sushi/sashimi plates. This more of a take-out place-only two tables and sushi is their specialty althought there are a few cooked items on their menu. I had the sashimi plate-good cuts of fish, about 20 pieces for 17.95. Also tried the dragon roll-very tasty and tightly rolled. I would stick with the sashmi or maki as a personal preference because the sushi rice can be a little mushy sometimes. 

Owner of the place was very friendly and chatty delving into everything about the sushi business during my visit. :) Nice to find a casual yet good quality sushi place in Toronto."}
{"text":"I read some great things about this place on Yelp so I thought I'd give it a try. 

The owner is definitely very knowledgeable and stresses that he only uses the freshest fish. I can attest to that. 

I ordered a 15 piece sashimi and a roll.. although I thought $30 was a bit much for it(it was just for me and he made it to order knowing it was just for one person) I would still order it again, purely for the freshness.  He gave me a compplimentary soup too.  I thought I wouldn't be full after eating it all, but I was and it was delicious.

One thing that's super cool about this place is they give you a little plastic dish for your soy sauce. I am always scrambling when I get home to find something to put it in. Somehow a plastic tupperwear container just doesn't complete the meal, know what I mean?  So this special and thoughtful touch is very cool in my books. 

I think I may have to order from here tonight, just because now I'm craving it and I don't feel like cooking dinner. Yum. White Tuna Sashimi, here I come! :)"}
{"text":"It's kind of in the middle of nowhere and super tiny as its a takeout spot, but it's some of the best sushi I've had in downtown Toronto. It's run by a Japanese owner who is friendly and he gave me some complimentary sushi to go with the rest of my order."}
{"text":"FYI, I'm going to write this one while the food is still sitting in my belleh.

The Sushi here is pretty good. I would say above average in fish quality, but you are going to pay for it. At if you want to eat at the restaurant you best hope its not raining, since this place is mainly a take-out venue.

The good food...
Salmon Sashimi (fresh, thick pieces)
Tuna (Red not purple, fresh)
Unagi (not as crispy/sweet as I prefer, but good)

The great food...
Yellow Tail (this kicked serious ass. Worth holding you down and beating the snot out of you if you happen have some on you while venturing into a seedy back alley. Not sure why you'd eat your sushi in such a dangerous place but  hey, if that's your thing it's your thing.)

The bad...
The miso soup was probably the worst I've had. Bland and tofu-less. In fact I didn't finish it (and I'm the type of guy will choke down almost any food I've bought rather than let it go to waste. I just couldn't be bothered this time.)

r"}
{"text":"It's good sushi. Not great. Not bad. But good. And a lot overpriced. I spent $30 for lunch - 16 pieces."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi in the area. The place is somewhat difficult to find as the sign is not too noticeable. It's quite small as many patrons come to pickup takeout instead of eating inside. There are tables to seat 6 to 8 tightly in the establishment. 

We were lucky to fit and were kindly greeted with Japanese hospitality. Our first order was the small combo that had a variety of rolls add well as nigiri. I have tried other places but was pleasantly surprised. The prices are more expensive than my usual North Ktown establishments but given that it's downtown,  it is reasonable for the area.

Quality is nice and fresh plus the dragon roll was especially good. I would definitely come here for takeout but I think I saw a sign that they delivered. We stayed slightly later than their closing time and were not rushed. This is now my go to sushi place in the area."}
{"text":"I really like the fish here, it's very fresh and taste very good. A tip, call first to put in your order or you may end up waiting a long time. I called and it was a 45-50 min wait and then I waited further when I got there. But I'll get to that later.

I love Sashimi so I ordered the Sashimi Momiji. I'd say there were really 5 cuts of fish, but really only like 9 pieces. They had this one fish that was like almost julienned, no idea what fish it was but that was my favorite.

The packaging is kind of like what I'd find at those sushi places in malls, but it's still nicer packaging that like styrofoam. They probably had a selection of salmon, tuna, snapper and that little cut up fish that I have no idea what it was but just melted in my mouth.
I also liked the little dish to put my soya sauce in. Too many times I try to find a small container for the soya sauce for takeout and I end up using some overly-large tupperware.

The price point I think is probably right for the quality of fish, but with that said it's more expensive than many other places because quality is a bit better.

The wait though was like really long. Everyone is polite about it, waiting until they get their food. I may order again because it does taste good, but I will make sure to order well in advance."}
{"text":"The first thing I have to say about this place is \"pricey\".  For a hole-in-the-wall, take out joint, they sure do know how to over price their food.  

Had their small party platter that came with tuna, salmon, shrimp and crab Inari (2pcs each), spicy salmon roll, California roll, shrimp tempura roll, avocado roll and cucumber roll for a total of 40 pieces that was $48. The quality of the fish wasn't bad but wasn't spectacular either. And for $1.20 per piece it wasn't worth it, especially since most of the items were veggie rolls.  I've had better variety and better quality fish in a party platter from Japango and their sister restaurant Yuzu No Hanna for a lot less. 

Also ordered two pieces of unagi sushi ($5) and a spider roll ($14).  The unagi was amazing.  I love unagi and almost always order it when I go for sushi, and this place did a great job with it.  The $14 spider roll was definitely over priced.  I normally see spider rolls priced between $11 - $13.  For $14 it should have been amazing, but it wasn't.

Considering that they obviously have far less overhead than other sushi places (i.e. it's a hole-in-the-wall, take-out joint) they marked up their prices way too much for what they offer."}
{"text":"Had sushi from here delivered. The food was pretty good, but felt pricey for the portions and quality I got. Fish was fresh and their roles were made well too. Have definitely been to some better sushi places with better quality for the same price."}
{"text":"Here's the thing: if you read through the reviews, you'll notice a trend.  Those who give it fewer than 4-5 stars or didn't think they got their money's worth where the ones who ordered the maki.  Don't make that mistake here.  Sushi 930 has some of the freshest, best sushi fish in the city, and ordering anything but the nigiri means You're Doing It Wrong.

It's not quite on par with Kaji or Yasu, but I would put their nigiri head-to-head with anywhere else in the city, at half the price.  The fish melts your mouth, requiring no soy or wasabi, as it shouldn't.  Their prices used to be even lower, which was downright crazy, and over time they've raised to a more reasonable level, but still nowhere near what you'd pay for the same quality elsewhere.  Yes, you will need to wait, and yes the takeout trays are flimsy and cheap, but if all you care about is amazing, well-prepared fish: here you go."}
{"text":"Full disclosure - this tiny, perfect Sushi 930 is mere steps from my front door... But the quality, variety, & freshness truly stand out.   Chef Tomo & his staff go above and beyond to delight the palate earning many loyal fans, and repeat customers!!   Could not recommend more highly!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to eating raw fish, I definitely want the freshest cut on my sushi plate. 

This little resto may appear to be nothing spectactular from the outside. I was sort of deterred from going thanks to its nearby location to the \"lovely\" Palace Arms Motel, err, I mean hotel. But don't let appearances fool you! (Okay, me). At least three people, who have no connection or relation to each other, have recommended this place to me. In fact, their responses were delivered with wide eyes and large grins, accentuating on how \"goooood\" the place was. One night, feeling pekish and lazy to make dinner, I sauntered over to check it out. Now, if you ask me about this place, I will also have the same big eyes and large grin: Sushi 930 is \"goooood\".

The fish is definitely fresh, and decently priced. I'm very particular when it comes to sashimi (I've had decent to awful) and here, it's definitely fresh. I've also heard that the chef can accommodate a dish for you if there's something in particular you like. I haven't tried doing this yet as I'm on a mission to try all of the items on the menu first. 

You can eat-in but it's a very small restaurant, primarily a \"pick-up dinner after a long day at work\" kind of a place. But it's definitely a neighbourhood favourite."}
{"text":"Ordering California Rolls from this location and then complaining it sucks, is the equivalent of ordering a Big Mac from The Keg, and then complaining that the beef is tasteless, over cooked and has the texture of cardboard. I know, this place looks like a take out joint, because when it comes down to it, that is exactly what this eatery is. 

But understand - this isn't the joint to pick up fast food sushi. You can go across the street to Bibap Express for cheap sushi, that will fill up your belly but not your soul.

Having eaten at Ja Bistro, Yuzu No Hana and Yasu Sushi in the recent past, I was thrilled to find this joint right beside my new abode, given that the quality is up there with those restaurants.

The fish from Sushi 930 is always tasty and obviously prepared with care every time (even if presentation is not always lovely). Luxuriously fatty pieces of salmon or sea bream, delicately seared, melts in one's mouth. The Amaebi is so fresh, diners should be surprised the shrimp don't jump off the little black trays.

I see a lot of people complaining about the prices in this thread - I can understand why because the fact is, it does cost more. But this is one of those cases where you get what you pay for, and maybe you get even a little more. 

Sushi 930 is truly a neighbourhood treasure."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, good prices, good value (good portion size).

If they only delivered I would be eating this every week. Unfortunately they are a bit far from me to be my staple sushi take-out place, but I highly recommend this to anyone that lives close or has a car."}
{"text":"After going back and forth with my current female friend about dinner preferences, (\"Pizza, Thai, Greek, Mexican?\")  I decided to do what I knew was a sure thing and hop on to Yelp to see if there were any nearby spots in between our respective spots in the city (I'm in LIttle Italy, she lives on Queens Quay), that we both had not been to but looked tasty enough to give a chance for a romantic evening.

Lucky for me, I managed to discover a gem: Sushi 930. Buoyed on by overwhelmingly positive reviews and being a bit of a Sushi aficionado myself (and a believer that the Japanese delicacy is kind of an aphrodesiac), we agreed to meet at their King & Strachan location. 

When we stepped in we found to our shock that there were only two(!) tables in the entire place, which means they're more of a take-out joint. Fine with us though. It could be worse and the food could be great...which it was.

We ordered Dragon, California, and Dynamite rolls along with some Miso soup and Edamame. There is a certain taste and texture to Sushi that is made with care and love, and in my opinion, the chefs at Sushi 930 have huge hearts: The fish was melt-in-your-mouth buttery and Maki sizes were large without being difficult to eat or dip in Soya. Even the Edamame came out at a perfect temperature and generously seasoned.

Both of us agreed that we would go back to Sushi 930, next time for take-out."}
{"text":"We've been visiting Sushi 930 every week for the past year.  They always have fresh tasty sushi and is a bargain for the quality.   Still, be prepared to pay a little more than average for a treat.

I recommend Sushi #8, Sashimi Sakura, or custom order."}
{"text":"Yes four star at a minimum. Bit pricy but what a tasty place! It's a super small shop and all they do is make sushi for take out. And it's unreal. Great spot for lunch. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Didn't find the fish was of particularly good quality. Wasn't inspired by the premises. Food was below average. Don't get the fuss. Much rather go to Raaw in Liberty Village."}
{"text":"Never judge a sushi joint by it's cover. 

At first glance (if you even glance walking by), its just another typical sushi joint on king st. This was my first impression upon stumbling on this oasis. I have been coming here for a couple years now and it's still one of my top picks for lunch during work hours. 
Its definitely small, however it has a welcoming feel when you first step inside. There is only a couple tables so most people just get take out.  Be warned, it gets really busy at lunch. Try to call ahead of time to be the rush. 

Alright, now the food. Fish is fresh, real fresh. They have the standard combos but I generally like to let the owner choose my fish for me. He always takes pride in letting me know the new menu items he has in that week. Horse Mackerel, Uni, etc... all good choices. #8 is good if you want a bit of everything.

If you're close by, you should give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I really expected much better reading the reviews. I ordered the #8 and it looked very sloppy, at least two pieces were broken in half. Two pieces of the order were SLIMY so I had to throw them out - the shrimp and I think it was squid or yellow tail (didn't get a chance to eat it since it was slimy). I just re-read the menu and I notice the #8 is supposed to come with spicy tuna roll...what? I swear I got a mix of salmon and tuna roll, not spicy. The service was friendly but overall I'm very disappointed. The only thing that was good was the salmon, tuna and eel and a separate order of the dragon roll. 

Not sure what flavourful fish everyone is raving about because other than the what I mentioned above everything tasted like nothing.

Oh the shiso leaf actually tastes more like cumin than mint :)"}
{"text":"I found my favorite sushi takeout place!

I ordered the Sushi No.8 combo based everyone's recommendation and I'm glad I did. There was more pieces of sushi than I expected and the fish was very fresh and tasty. There were some tuna rolls with spicy sauce which were very good -- they do not use chopped up tuna which all other sushi restaurants do which is a very good thing because you can really tell how good quality the tuna is. I am always fearful of spicy tuna rolls because the chopped tuna that's used is often trimmings from their sushi/sashimi and masked with a spicy mayo sauce.
At first I thought the side of wasabi was too little, but they also put some wasabi in the sushi so the amount was just right.

There are a couple very thoughtful touches that other sushi places should follow. Sushi 930 does not use the very annoying, useless, unenvironmentally-friendly plastic grass garnish that everyone uses. They use a piece of shiso leaf instead which is really nice because it is edible. Shiso has a unique subtle mint flavour and supposedly to be a digestive aid, so after you're done with your sushi meal you could nibble on the leaf. Just to warn you it's a bit of an acquired taste.

Another thoughtful touch is that they give you a small plastic dipping dish for your soy sauce. This should be a must for any sushi take out because you can never find a place to contain your soy sauce and mix in your wasabi (other than the cumbersome sushi tray lid).

I also ordered a side of seaweed salad, but was too full from the sushi to get to it.
I also received a complimentary miso soup with my order which was very tasty.

The place is strictly a takeout place, as it is very small and only have a couple tiny tables with next to no ambiance, and they don't offer beer or sake to enjoy with your meal.
The couple that runs the takeout place are so very friendly and nice. I will definitely be back, often!"}
{"text":"I may be overselling it, but I avoided sushi in Toronto for months after having sushi in Tsukiji, but this was the place that got me over the freshest sushi I have ever had.  

It is remarkbly fresh.  It is a little pricey but in the end, you are probably paying $2 more than you would at any other place but the quality is well worth the slight premium.  

The staff is super friendly, but its definitely a take out joint.  I think they also do delivery as I have seen the guy and girl that works there walk around King during the day."}
{"text":"I rarely eat sushi [I'm a steak and potatoes man]. But let me tell you when I go for sushi, it's got to be fresh. It's got to be good. Before tonight, I was in Hawaii, and you are up against real fresh fish on that island!

Sushi 930 is fantastic. The people there make you feel like you are in Japan, and you have to order to go. It's a take out place [tiny store front] and they are chatty in there. You can tell they do this, for the love of the food. And it shows.

I got the Sushi # 8 [highly recommend it]. The 8 pieces of sushi they give you change daily, as it is based on the fresh fish they recieve that day.
I got White Tuna Sashimi [To F*$!#ing die for]. Oh the texture of the tuna. I just want it again. NOW.
And I got a california roll, just cuz. Top Notch.
And they have the ginger that is so juicy, and thinly sliced, and just. Oh Damn.

Now for my wrap up.
Amazing Food. Check
Amazing Sushi. Check
Amazing chefs. Check
Decent Prices. Check
You'll Love it. Check

I recommend getting the Fresh Fish, or pieces with fish form this place, as that is what they are all about. The Sushi. The Fresh. The Fish.

Enjoy your take out friends. Let me know how much you loved it too."}
{"text":"Just popped in for lunch, ordered up combo 1, california roll/ avocado roll/ spicy salmon, (+ a salmon hand roll on the side). The first thing I noticed and really liked was the taste and texture of the rice. It wasn't overly sweet and you can tell it was well made. The slices of fish were nice and chunky, fresh tasting as well. 

Overall really satisfied with this spot considering the west end has so many poor options. Grab it to go or sit in their cozy spot (seats at most 6)!"}
