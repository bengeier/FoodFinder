{"text":"We may have gone on a very off day, but the service we received was awful. We sat down and received our menus. Within 2 minutes waitress approached table no smile no welcome ..,ready? We asked for a few more minutes. Approached us again ready? I then noticed an item I was going to order however wanted the spicy version. No joke back and forth back forth and she approaches table to state extra dollar, I asked why? It's a change was the response. I fully understand if you are changing food item all I am asking is spicy sauce and menu stated same price for spicy vs non-spicy version. We left without ordering and unfortunately never got to taste the food that is so highly praised. We may have hit a wrong day.  For a measly dollar they lost potential clients.    In hindsight we located another wonderful Sushi restaurant who provided A++++ service and their sushi was delicious. We've returned three times to this other location."}
{"text":"We ordered the small combo for dinner, which is 31 piece combination of sashimi, nigiri and maki. This combo was the perfect size for our appetite that night and the sushi was pretty good - the sashimi was fresh and the spicy mayo they used for the spicy salmon roll was yummy! The combo came with miso soup and salad, but they were kind enough to give us a couple of extra sides - calamari and a small bowl of noodle in broth.   Customer service was good and the waitress was friendly. I'd come back again!"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch after shopping near-by. Service was horrible. not offered any tea or water for 15 mins. server came with my meal, offered me kim-chi, then never brought the kim-chi. finally got the kim-chi and it tasted awful (like the worst kim-chi i've ever had). ordered cold noodles - it was just ok. went to pay the bill and gave me the wrong bill. server didn't even apologize. overheard the server screw up someone else's order by not putting avocado in a california roll?!!"}
{"text":"Tataki roll and Haemul Tang soup was on point. Food is handled with care and ingredients are of good quality. Best hot pot Ive had. It was nice having food not over salted for once."}
{"text":"Really fantastic, tucked away restaurant. Was up in Richmond Hill for an event and started the night off here. The owners were extremely attentive and the food came out quickly/was delicious. Probably because we were a bigger group, but everyone received complementary soups/salads to start and ice cream to finish. Great place to stop if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend.  Don't go at busy times (6pm-8pm) or anniversary specials.  Go at around 5pm or after 8pm, otherwise place will get busy.  We went on a Sunday.  Food was fantastic.  Service was great.  The sashimi was amazing.  The best place in the world to get the best sashimi is at the Tokyo fish market where the fish is super fresh.   This place is the closet thing in GTA IMO."}
{"text":"This review is based on my takeout experience.Decided to try this place out because we live in the neighbourhood . We got takeout and ordered 3 different rolls. The tataki roll supposed to have scallop, \"crab\" meat and torched white tuna. It was 90% \"crab\" meat and tiny bit scallop, and it was escolar not really white tuna - which is typical at most Korean-Japanese restaurants. The spider roll had a lot of cucumber as filler and the crab was small - the same class of soft shell crab used by most Korean-Japanese restaurant. I guess the black dragon was the better one (California with shrimp tempura and BBQ eel on top). I hope mediocre Japanese restaurants like this will try to use better quality ingredients - because customers will notice and will not mind paying more for it. Just because all other restaurants of the same genre are doing things one way doesn't mean you have to follow and not aim higher. I may give them another try later when I crave Japanese food and is lazy to drive farther, hopefully they will improve."}
{"text":"This restaurant easily deserves 5 stars. Excellent food, great price, great service, nice people, etc. This is the only sushi restaurant I go to anymore. Support this place!! :)"}
{"text":"Perfect for a rainy friday evening with the kids. Ordered the Sashimi+Galbi+Tempura bento, Chicken Terriyaki Donburi kids meal, Pork Donkatsu kids meal and a six pc avocado roll.  I love that Oyaji has kids meals for $7. Lots of chicken, veggies in the donburi and the donkatsu looks like a regular adult portion. Avocado rolls have large pieces of avocado. Their rolls are the perfect size, generous on fillings and just the right amount of rice.  Didn't get it this time but my favourite is the U-don Oyaji Combo Special (U-don+3pc california roll+3pc spicy salmon roll+3pc shrimp tempura).  Owners and servers are very friendly, reasonable prices, great portion sizes and lots of parking."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in the area. Generous portions, especially the sashimi and sushi pieces. Always fresh. The combos and platters are great for take out as well. Prices are reasonable. The staff are friendly and caring.  I will always come back to this place."}
{"text":"Excellent place for sushi and select Korean dishes! Sushi is fresh and Korean food is very tasty. Would love it if they had more Korean dishes like the classic ones such as Gamja Tang or Kim Bab. Great customer service too."}
{"text":"Really yummy and fresh sushi (especially for the price, I had the 18 pcs Maki Set C for $18.02 after tax)-- comparable to Mi Ne up Yonge a bit.  The service was friendly and quick, no complaints.  Atmosphere was enjoyable and pretty quiet (went around 4pm on a Wednesday, only considerable noise was from cp24 playing on the tv), the restaurant is clean and well maintained, booths are available in a separate section, however we chose to sit in the main area.  We did receive (unexpectedly) a few free appetizers-- calamari tempura and crunchy noodle soup.  Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi I've ever had. Every dish here (whether it's Korean Japanese food) is fantastic! Not to mention that they always give you an extra free sample of food to try (tonight's was fried seaweed...delicious). The price is very reasonable for the quality ingredients and the service was impeccable. This place is a great choice for Sushi or Korean food."}
{"text":"My family loved our lunch here. It is a relatively new restaurant and we hope it stays because it has a nice variety of dishes, they have Korean side dishes even if you order Japanese food! and the family who owns it are very kind and generous. My husband and I ordered Korean (tofu soup and seafood noodle soup) and my parents ordered sushi rolls and a sashimi garden salad. We were all eating from eachother's plates because everything was delicious! Right amount of spice, homemade noodles and not too much rice in the rolls. A great addition to the Richmond Hill food scene!"}
{"text":"best most underrated sushi place in Richmond Hill ^_^ lunchtime specials and sushi boats are awesome here. plus they have Korean food"}
{"text":"Oyaji provided a great dinner experience! They have a lot of options on their menu, including sushi, sashimi, bentos, udon as well as Korean fare. For a party of two, we decided to share the sushi + sashimi + chicken teriyaki dinner and the spicy salmon roll. We also got to try their new summer roll, which consisted of large chunks of salmon, avocado and crab. Portions were very generous, especially for the spicy salmon rolls, they definitely did not cheap out on the salmon as the rolls were large and consisted a generous amount of salmon. The sushi and sashimi were all very fresh!   The service was also great as the staff were super friendly and attentive to customer service! Service was quite fast as we received our food in a very reasonable amount of time, yet quality of the food was not compromised. I will definitely be returning to try some of their other offerings!"}
{"text":"Got the Oyaji combo, though the menu may look kind of small in portion that serves for 3, it'll leave your stomach filled right and happy.   The quality of food is amazing even small appetizers like the shrimp and veggies tempura are perfectly deep fried to the nearest perfection. They are generous with the sashimis as they keep them thick, fresh and tasty. They also serve you udon included in the combo, with a broth that leaves a happy tongue as well as a refreshed feeling.  Service is amazing as they are the most polite as they can be, normally would not rate a restaurant 5 stars but the service, cleanliness and the quality of the food combined it is really hard not to give a 5/5.   Thank you had a great experience!"}
{"text":"I came with a friend over winter break to catch up. On the outaide, the establishment definitely looks small but the interior is quite deep. The atmosphere is quite quaint and quiet. Our meals came with small appetizers, which is always a plus but our entrées were quite tasty as well. The staff was courteous and was patient when we had trouble deciding what we wanted to order. Overall, it's definitely somewhere you can take a date or your family to have a nice dinner."}
{"text":"The service is great and food is pretty good. Only downfall is parking. It's shared with Women's fitness club and depending what time you go, you won't find any parking at all. They do have reserved parking but only few spots. It's a close drive from home, walking even would be fine.  The quality of food is good and made very fresh. I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Solid food with very reasonable prices. We arrived at around 7pm on a Friday to order takeout, and the place was really busy. We waited around 35 minutes before we were able to get our food. For two people, we ordered a chirashi, a bento box (bulgogi, 4 pcs sushi and tempera) and a salmon-avocado-tobiko roll. Tip: there's a 10% discount if you order takeout and pay with cash. The total came up to be about $40. Portion sizes were good, fish was fresh plus they gave us free miso soup and salad too.   Will definitely return in the future for takeout and maybe dine-in if it's not too busy."}
{"text":"I ordered the sushi lunch special. Sushi pieces had decent amount of sashimi and tasted good. The rolls had a lot of stuff inside and tasted great. The lunch special came with other kinds of food to nibble as well. For a $10 meal, I was very pleased with the experience. Food, service, and the interior were all excellent. I think this restaurant deserves more than a flat 4-star rating. I definitely want to come back."}
{"text":"Now, one of the best place to sashimi-takeout for me, and even when I visited near closing time, the server was really kind enough, and also put ice-pack on top of the sashimi box to keep it fresh for 30 minutes of driving. The last call is until 10:30PM, so it's very sweet place to order something Japanese at late night, too. Recommended! :-)"}
{"text":"First time coming here for dinner and it was a great experience.  I ordered the Chirashi and the fish was fresh and portion size was generous.  My husband ordered the bimbimbap and really enjoyed that as well.  The beef comes raw and becomes cooked as you mis it in tge hot stone bowl.  We also got the Fire Viking roll which was tasty and fun to see.   They gave 3 a few free appetizers as well including soup, salad, mini noodle, grilled salmon head, korean sidedishes, and icecream.   Service was friendly and excellent.  The plaza looks old on the outside but inside is clean and comfortable.  I would come here again when craving sashimi/sushi but don't want ayce."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in terms of quality that I've had. They give you free side dishes to start your meal. The tataki roll is the best roll, I've ever tasted. The waiter/ waitress attends to you constantly to make sure everything is up to your liking. They also give you free desserts (mango pudding) when your finished. It's not all you can eat but the sushi quality makes up for it and fills you up anyways."}
{"text":"Had a very good meal with friends. Four of us shared a variety of dishes and it was excellent. I especially enjoyed the Soon Tofu soup; a nice level of hot spice and just really tasty.  The table ordered Gyoza Yaki and Korean Pizza to start. They were just great and a perfect start.   We ordered two soups; the Soon Tofu for spice lovers and a Crunchy Noodle soup for the others. Just wonderful.  We followed with Beef Teriyaki and a Oyaji Roll. All just perfect.  The staff were very attentive and friendly, and the restaurant had plenty of cubicle style seating as well as larger, private cubicles for larger groups."}
{"text":"After a long day at school today and standing up to bake for five hours really made me hungry.  I was totally crazing for some quality sushi and sashimi.  However, it was pretty late already, and I was uptown so I was scrambling to find out which sushi restaurant to visit.  At the end, I decided to go to Oyaji since it was closed to where my parents live.  The servers were all really nice as I got a warm welcome fron each of the server.  The decor was really nice with a lot of wooden decoration which makes the place very organic.  I love the sashimi and sushi, they were really fresh and tasty.  I would love to mention the salmon belly sashimi which was the highlight of the meal.  It was so fresh and melt in my mouth.  And the bbq beef ribs were well balanced with charred and sweet taste.  The customer service was just outstanding and I would come back again."}
{"text":"Oyaji sushi was a great experience for a more authentic sushi experience as opposed to many all you can eat sushi restaraunts. Our server was very polite and prompt with service. I constantly could see her checking on our meals progress and was there to refill our water and take our plates for each step of the meal.  I ordered a bento box with sashimi, chicken teriyaki and sushi. Our meal started with a number of appatizers including a salad, miso soup a calamari ring and another noodle soup. Our entree included everything as expected along with rice. The portion size was very good. The fish was of good quality and the chicken was well cooked. We even received ice cream at the end of the meal. I would recommend this restaraunt to anyone looking for a nice authentic japanese meal."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0  Came to try this place as I was in the area before dinner and I am glad that I did. If you are looking to satisfy your cravings for some simple yet higher than average quality Japanese food with fair prices then this is the place to be.  Oyaji Bento (Sashimi + Galbi + Tempura) - A great combination if you are looking for both Japanese and Korean BBQ Short Ribs. Portion size was very reasonable and everything was on point. The rice that accompanied the dish had a nice texture as well.  Tataki Roll - The white tuna was fresh and tasty. Rice to filling ratio was perfect. However the rice could have been on the drier side so that the individual grains are still visible and intact.  Service was friendly, attentive and efficient."}
{"text":"First time been here, the price is reasonable  but the quality is below average.  We order the medium sushi maki and sashimi boat, the sashimi ( especially the sweet shrimps, didn't tastes fresh) the uni are like water, and the only one tasted alright is salmon.   For the sushi, I don't understand why they put wasabi in the middle of the rice without telling the customer, beside that. The rice are hard as stone and no vinegar taste, feels like I'm eating overnight rice along with wasabi,   the quality of sushi is ridiculous, comparing to the sashimi, the texture of the sushi are bad. Feels like I'm eating a pieces of rubber.   Overall. I probably won't comeback anymore, if you're looking for cheap sushi without the quality, it might be a fit for you but I rather pay more to get a decent, fresh quality sushi to myself."}
{"text":"A middle of the road sushi joint.  Prices are just okay and I would have to agree with a previous reviewer that the quality could be better.  We ordered the medium combo sushi boat and while the salmon tasted pretty fresh there were other pieces of sashimi (like their red tuna) that didn't.  Quality is inconsistent.  They also have a lunch menu available Monday-Saturday which was reasonably priced.  The place is just okay.  I wouldn't make a special trip to come here though."}
{"text":"Great value for the money!   This is a small, Korean-owned Japanese restaurant and it was our first time coming here! We were a bit concerned about the freshness of the sashimi when pulling into the square (it's located a small outdoor strip mall) but re-assured when we saw a decent number of families here on Labour Day.  We took our time ordering off the menu (they do not have lunch specials on \"holidays\" - this includes Stat Holidays) and I ordered the Bulgogi + Sushi + Tempura Bento set ($16.95 @ time of writing), while the rest of my family split the Small Sashimi Combo (can't remember how much this was) + a Fire Dragon Roll ($14.95) + Mixed Veggie + Shrimp Tempura ($6.95).  The food came out amazingly fast, and was very fresh! We were all served sides of salad, miso soup (with tofu, mushrooms, and seaweed), and noodle soup (with a clear broth and tempura bits sprinkled in) along with our meals.   The sushi that I had in my bento set was of adequate freshness (a bit smaller than I expected), but the tempura was lovely - not too greasy and very crisp (my bento also came with a side of japchae). The quantity of food was more than filling enough for me!  The sashimi combo was very fresh - an assortment of lightly seared white tuna, snapper, salmon, salmon belly, tuna, and even cooked octopus! The Fire Dragon roll was also outstanding - a very thin layer of rice of seaweed was used to hold the contents together, and the seared salmon + bonito flakes on the top lent the roll a nice smoky flavour.  This place is a little more expensive than your average asian joint, but well worth it for the quality!"}
{"text":"Fire viking roll contained tempura shrimp and topped with shrimp - the roll was wrapped in tin foil and was lit on fire - the rice got soft/ mushy, still a yummy roll with the sauce they had on top  Small sushi/sashimi platter - quite average, wasn't the best sushi I had and wasn't the worst  Very friendly staff members, reasonable price  Overall decent sushi place to go to"}
{"text":"It may have been just bad luck, but the cuts of fish I got in my sashimi platter were thick and full of sinew. The nigiri had way too much wasabi in it, felt like my mouth was burning the entire time.  But then again, I showed up to the restaurant near closing, so I'd take my review with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"Amazing service ... 2 complimentary soups... 1 salad. The sushi is so fresh the serive is amazing ... ask for a private booth"}
{"text":"Delicious food, everybody is very friendly and good prices. Great alternative to tomo, as it's not as busy and better prices. Plus we love all of the complimentary food at the beginning of the meal and free ice cream at the end"}
{"text":"Is was ok. With all the competition nearby you have to be extra special to win in the Sushi game. I found everything to be just ok-good. The sashimi donburi was decent but I found a muddy after taste with the snapper, the red tuna was a bit tough and overall the temp of the fish was a little too room temp for us. The shrimp tempura was low quality. The shrimp were tiny, same as you would find at AYCE. This is a cheap shortcut they shouldn't take as it affects not only the shrimp tempura app but also all rolls that have this ingredient. The salad needs a lot of work. The Cali roll was falling apart by the time it got home. Sorry just not good enough to get my repeat business."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been here twice. The first time we came here, the service was prompt and the waiter/waitresses were really attentive. So clearly the food was good enough to make us come back here again, since most of us don't live in the area.   So the second time we came was on their 1st anniversary event, which offered 50% off all foods. We took into consideration that they would be busy due to the sheer volume of orders and customers, so we didn't necessarily mind waiting for a table or even our food. However, they were completely unprepared to handle the amount of business that the event would bring.   With that said, I can confidently say that I have never experienced such poor service in my life, at any restaurant. I've been to really busy restaurants, and yet they were still able to accommodate for us. So here's a point form version of why this was a horrid experience.   1. I did not get any of my orders. I ordered a medium combo sushi boat and a salmon avocado tobiko handroll, and got nothing. We asked them multiple times whether our food was coming, and they said they would check. However, long story short- they somehow mixed up our orders, and gave our sushi boat to someone else. We waited 2.5 hours for this, only to be told that they could make it if we gave them another 20 minutes. Honestly, if it was going to take 20 minutes, I feel like they could have mentioned it the second or third time they said they would check on our order. I was literally falling asleep while waiting for food.  2. My friend didn't get her udon. Our one friend got his food pretty promptly, and the reason is that it was kitchen food rather than sushi. However, I'm pretty sure udon is categorized as kitchen food.  3. We had to keep asking servers for tea or water, because we never got anything the moment we were seated. And it took ~15-30 minutes for us to get drinks.   4. Pretty much every single person who was seated after us, got all their orders, ate, paid and left. We only know this because the restaurant was basically empty with exception to a few people waiting for takeout, by the time we left.   5. It took 1 hour just to get 2 rolls, in which I'm pretty sure my handroll could have been included in that.   6. No one bothered to tend to us, regardless of how many times we pushed the call button. The button was obviously functional because we could hear the ding. So the only time we could actually flag a server down was when they brought food or by physically waving them down as they walked by.   7. No one apologized for the poor customer service, instead they kind of just whispered as we left. One of the waitresses apologized as we asked for our bill, but she didn't really know how to handle the situation.   Overall, I feel like our patronage was not respected by them. We aren't any less important than the next customer, and we are still paying for our food. Like I said at the beginning, we understood that they were busy; however, that is no excuse for treating customers so poorly or giving preference to other customers over us.   Time is our greatest currency, and we can never get it back. So that's approximately 3 hours of my life that I will never get back from this experience. The only thing I got to eat was the complementary miso soup and salad. At least McDonalds gave me my meal promptly after this.    EDIT: After the third time coming here, their customer service was a lot better and they understood the errors from their event. While our second experience was poor, I would recommend giving this place a shot when it isn't busy. Bumped up to 4 stars, since their portioning is generous."}
{"text":"Thursday night visit and was here about a month ago, the service both visits were kind and friendly and they have the Korean style table button for attention. The second visit seemed to be short staffed, the only server was extremely busy and forgot a few things, but I don't blame her.   I recommend getting the oyaji combo it can feed 4 people and if need be just get a other maki roll on the side. The combo comes with a wide variety of foods sushi and Korean, udon noodles, ribs...   The food was overall pretty good. Sashimi was fine  the spider roll was good. I wasn't a fan of the spicy salmon. The pieces were huge and so much going on with the toppings. It's my favorite maki roll so I'm a bit tough on it. There's a big bowl of udon to be shared as well.   Ice cream at the end if you get oyaji combo."}
{"text":"This restaurant is memorable mainly because we received a bunch of appetizers on the house. We were a group of 8, and ordered a large sushi and sashimi boat, along with the fire viking roll and spicy pizza.   We all received salad, miso soup, and a tiny bowl of noodles to start. Then, lo and behold, the waiter comes out with two plates each of calamari, grilled salmon, and raw oysters- all on the house! I was surprised that we got so many free appetizers. They also gave us mango ice-cream at the end of our meal.  The sushi was pretty good- I like that there's a lot of filling and a minimal amount of rice. The sashimi was average and did not taste very fresh. The spicy pizza came with spicy salmon on top, and was very savoury and crispy. As for the fire viking roll, it came out wrapped in tin foil, on a sizzling hot plate. The chef then lit the plate on fire. To be honest, it was cool to watch but I feel like the fire did not add to the taste at all.   In terms of service, the waiter and waitress were friendly, but they didn't come back to check up on us at all, after serving all the food. I suppose we were expected to use the 'call' button to request for service, but it would be nice if they came back to check up on us at least once, considering the restaurant wasn't even that busy for a Sunday night."}
{"text":"The food is alright and i have been a regular customer because the place is close to my house however the manager that works there is so rude and does not accommodate customers what so ever. All she wants to do is charge customers extra money even though you are taking something out of your order to replace it with a cheaper item!! All she wants to do is over charge customers. I introduced many people here as well and although they liked the food the rude service and manager are not worth it on top of the over priced food and we have all stopped coming here. Many of my friends and family also thought the same thing and didn't think it was worth their time and money. I wish they changed the manager at least but oh well their loss because they lost a lot of loyal customers. There are many better places with the same menu and way better food and customer service."}
{"text":"We used the come her a lot and the food was amazing. From my knowledge, there's a new owner and food has been getting a little sloppy."}
{"text":"I've been ordering takeout from Oyaji for more than 2yrs and I've never had a problem with the quality of food or service. In my opinion they are one of the best Japanese/Korean restaurants in the area by far. I've always have been greeted warmly and the food has always tasted fresh as well ready on time. Those that say they are on the level of ayce must be out of their minds."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the staff were very very nice. We ordered two rolls and edemamim(I dont know to spell it:/) and they were amazing. Before our food comes they brought us Tea, 2 kind of soups, small salad and 2 pieces of something like it was like chips! Then our rolls came and after we asked for our bill they brought us two scoop of ice cream!!!! Very amazing loved their service and would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"My to go place for all korean and jap food :D a little far from scarborough but it is worth!"}
{"text":"One of our regular places.  Excellent and friendly service in conjunction with good food.  The sashimi and sushi is very tasty and more importantly fresh.  Off the beaten path but that's not a bad thing since parking is a breeze.  Good value, good service, good food!  Definitely worth the hunt to find this place the first time since it will be easy to find when you come again."}
{"text":"Excellent! I came here with my mom for the first time, and it won't be our last.  We came specifically for Korean, so can't speak to the Japanese part of it.   We ordered a bibimbap (9.95) and seafood pizza (11.95).  The customary appetizers came first and were very enjoyable, as they were different from the normal types. We received a tiny noodle soup and herring(?) with radish. We also got soup and salad for both of us, even though it technically is supposed to come with only for the bibimbap (according to the menu).   Seafood pizza came first. It's huge! Very thick with plenty of shrimp, squid and crab sticks. The veg in it are green onion, cucumber and mushroom. We ate half and packed the rest (8 pieces in total).   To our surprise, a second round of appetizers came, marinated peanuts, kimchi and spinach.   Bibimbap was also huge and had lots of beef, egg, and veg. The stone bowl was sizzling, and gave the rice a nice crunch without burning it. I have to say that the bowl part is impressive, bc so many places just put the food in a hot (or not) bowl, and leave it at that. Our stone bowl actually popped along with the sizzles. Well done!  Last was a nice dessert of green tea ice cream. Just the right size, not too big, not too small :)  The decor of the place was very nice, evenly spaced out so you won't feel squished in even if the place is full. Plates and dishes were very nice and pretty. Ceramic, not plastic.   Staff was very friendly, polite and everyone was smiling. Great service and prompt!  Last thing, and for all the Asians out there, this is a big point. Elderly Asian parents typically tip 10% of the pretax bill. For us this is $21.90, which means they would typically get $2.20 tip. My mom asked me if I had a couple of dollars. I threw it in along with some extra, making the tip a bit over $4. My mom didn't say anything and tucked the money into the pocket to make sure it won't fall out. You can't get any better than that right? That's how much she was impressed with this place!"}
{"text":"Located in a relatively non-descript plaza in Richmond Hill, had it not been for the great Yelp reviews we probably would not have ventured here for dinner. The restaurant is sectioned off into booth-like table arrangements to create a more intimate setting. Although the place appears fairly small, there is additional seating in an adjacent room.  Unlike many Japanese restaurants closer to where I live, this one serves a la carte options.The menu is extensive and I noted they have quite a few yummy sounding options for maki, set courses, as well as sushi and sashimi platters served on those fancy wooden boats. Our chicken teriyaki set meals came with 9 pieces of assorted sashimi and some sushi. The chicken was moist and flavourful and was drizzled with a nice teriyaki sauce . It was served atop a bed of sautéed vegetables (although proportionally heavy on the onions). This was preceded by miso soup, another soup with noodles and broth, as well as salad. The sashimi pieces were thick cuts of fresh-tasting fish. To my disappointment they put wasabi in their servings of sushi (as opposed to having wasabi on the side), but I suppose I should have mentioned to the wait staff that I preferred it without wasabi. Our meals also came with green tea ice cream. The prices are reasonable, especially considering the sizeable portions.   Besides good food and a nice quiet environment, what really sets this place apart is the attentive service. We called 10 minutes before arrival to reserve a table and it was ready when we arrived. The staff were very friendly and attentive throughout our meal. And when hubby forgot his iPhone at the restaurant, the staff were helpful in locating it and had it ready for him when we returned 20 minutes later to retrieve it. As sad as it is to say, I'm not sure one could say the same would happen at many other establishments. For this reason as well as the decently priced delicious food, we will be back when we find ourselves in the area."}
{"text":"Came with colleagues and I still love this place. They had ac on during this awful heat wave!  Their chirashi looks good but I cheaped out and got the sashimi lunch instead which has 12 pc with rice, salad, salmon teriyaki, and noodles. The rice didn't have sushi vinegar and I think that's because it wasn't chirashi.  Anyway the sashimi was great! I like how they had this potato noodle soup as an app. Very tasty.  I'd come again. Their sashimi is thicc, boi"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food, very nice and peaceful place after lunchtime during the week. My husband and I were in a bit of a hurry so they made sure to get our order right out. Definitely good place , great prices. I would recommend"}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly staff and great quality sushi. I've always enjoyed my meals."}
{"text":"Came here when it was almost closing after attending a performance at the Richmond Hill Arts Centre. It was empty and we got to sit in a private booth. The appetizers were generous, with a salad, miso soup, calamari, and some noodles immersed in soya sauce. I don't know if it's because they're closing soon or just our luck but everything fried (calamari and spicy salmon dynamite roll) was EXTREMELY soggy.  Oyaji Sashimi ~$18 (18pc raw fish) Definitely not frozen which is the best part about this place.  Matsu Sushi ~$15 (12 pc sushi, 3 pc spicy salmon, 3 pc california roll) The california roll was my favourite! However, there was just an inexplicable amount of wasabi hidden in every sushi piece! It was powdered wasabi too which is probably why it had huge bursts of flavour. I felt like crying during the meal.  I'm disappointed and probably won't come back, despite the good reviews here."}
{"text":"Oyaji sushi is a lovely small family-owned business. We have never dined in, but have ordered takeout several times. The sushi rivals mi-ne sushi, but the price is better ! We always call ahead when ordering takeout, and our order is always efficiently fulfilled. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is really upsetting.. For their 1st Anniversary Event 50%off Day. November 5th. I've taken into consideration that they were really busy and had a huge line up. I've worked in restaurants and even taking into consideration of their backup orders. But they didn't handle our end result well at all; which is big deal in customer service.  Being said, that was the worst experience I've Ever. had.    1. My friend didn't get any of her 4 orders, zero.   2. We didn't get our water or tea until 30-40mins after asking 3 different servers.  3. Other people who lined up got seated 45min-1hour after us got all their orders, ate, paid and left. While we stayed hours later still waiting for our food.  4. No one would come to our table no matter how many times we would hit the call button, we were completely forgotten and neglected.  5. We waited 3 hours... Got Less than half our orders and be told it would take another 30mins to get the food.  6. They gave our big Sushi Boat that takes the longest to make.. And gave it to someone else. They didn't come to tell us and decided not to tell us at all until we asked, and that was after we already waited 2.5hours and they said they could make it but would take another 30mins.  7. The owner didn't even come to apologize to us, only our waiter for the whole ordeal.  8. The whole place was full, even with a long line up when we were seated and when we left we were the only ones with 2 others at the restaurant.  *This is really upsetting cuz we came for the first time one other time before this and we had an Amazing experience here and then we get this...   Really upset.   Edit: I've been contacted by one of the business owners (Kyung K) and been given a sincere lengthy apology and would like for us to experience another 50% off day on them.  One of my friends who was their that day would really like to take on their offer.  I'll be back with another review once we go back."}
{"text":"The soup I ordered was very good. We also received complimentary tea, mini soup and green tea ice cream! Friendly Bedienung"}
{"text":"Place is located on what the locals call the downtown of Richmond Hill.  It is a bit hard to spot unless you are actually making your way out to have a meal here.  It is located on a side plaza and near the corner of the plaza, so keep your eyes peeled.    One thing I say I do like about the place is the fact that they have these little buzzers on the side to let the waitresses and waiters know when you need them to come by.  Food was.......to my particular taste relatively average.  Friends of mines were asking me for advice on sushi restaurants, and due to some relatively stellar reviews on this place, I was expecting maybe a bit more than what the reality was.  Sushi was warm and not to my tastes, and udon....meh I have had better.  Tempura was disappointing as the shrimp they used I swear AYCE Sushi places uses bigger shrimp than theirs.    There was also miscommunication sometimes whereby the waitress serving continuously forgets that you have asked for tea multiple times and the fact that it seems like the buttons that you use to let them be aware are often ignored to an extent.  Now, I do want to let everyone know, that if you are actually looking for sushi places within the vicinity as in the closest areas within a 5-10 km range, this place might be considered a 3.5-4 star rating.  However, due to the fact that I generally like to go around to eat and try out new trendy food places and locations, I can not give it higher than a 3 stars."}
{"text":"Oyaji Sushi is a hidden gem! We came tonight for a last minute birthday dinner for my daughter.   From the moment we walked in we were greeted with a friendly smile by Mrs Kang.  Once seated we poured over the large menu for about 15 minutes before deciding on gyoza appetizer, medium sashimi platter, assorted dragon maki boat, tempura udon and a salmon teriyaki/don katzu bento box.  The friendly waitress surprised us with complimentary miso soup, noodle soup, salad and seaweed crisps. They also brought 6 gyoza, enough for each of us at no extra charge.  The food was fresh and delicious and came quickly but with ample time in between so that we could enjoy each of the dishes at our leisure. The waitress also brought a complimentary grilled salmon head that was so flavourful.  At the end of the meal they served green tea/mango ice cream as well - with a birthday candle for my daughter.  We will definitely be back again to try other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is great! You can't go wrong ordering anything here. It's all so good.  Staff is incredibly friendly too."}
{"text":"Very decent Japanese food. Sushi was well made with good rice consistency and taste. The presentation of food was well done. Fish was fresh. Staff were super friendly and attentive. There was a kids menu that they were trialling this weekend. I don't think it's particularly of good value, although the kids did enjoy them, especially the juice and ice cream part. The restaurant even gave us adults free ice creams too. That's how good business run. We had a great dinning experience. We will come back again for sure. Prob will try their Korean food next time as well."}
{"text":"Came here in a referral basis was a little shy but I can say, hands down a 5 star experience.  The service was wonderfully filled with smiling faces and the food is absolutely fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I secretly cursed @modernpicasso who booked this place bc i felt it was going to be expensive and unsatisfying - two common traits of food venues that are chosen by him . It had the atmosphere of a legit Japanese restaurant that reminded me of the time we dropped close to $50 and left hungry but I digress.  Galbi Bento - this box was excellent and came with thickly sliced white tuna, salmon, and red tuna sashimi.  The galbi was ok and came with a bed of vegetables. The tempura had nice assortment of shrimp, mushroom, sweet potato, broccoli, green pepper and onion. This box was satisfying.  The noodle shot appetizer was great and the  salad was decent and not over saturated with dressing like most japanese places.  I finishes off my gfs sashimi donburi {like chirashi} and it was decently plentiful for 12 bucks.  Service - adequate, use a call button to summon them to your booth. Could use more frequent check ins to ensure we had enough tea etc but I forgive you.  Pleasant surprise - FREE ICE CREAM. I chose green tea but have no idea what it tastes like bc my gf ate it all as I typed this REVIEW. bitch... Other choice is mango.  Bill for me was only 23.67 plus tip for the generously portioned Bento.  I am happy.  The tea served was free and tasted decent and not cheap.  Value 4/5"}
{"text":"When I lived in Richmond Hill this was my go to sushi place. I have not been here for some time but glad to see their quality of food and service has remained great! Wish I could come here more often!"}
{"text":"I was passing by this old plaza and along the sudden I saw sushi place there, I was shocked that plaza can handle such a restaurant. Anyway we decided to stop and have a dinner. First of all we saw prices and we couldn't find all you can eat and we assumed it wouldn't be good for that amount of money but we were wrong, first of all we have been served with complementary food which made me half full already. We also decided to order sake and lady asked if we want medium or larger so we decided large, she brought us tea pot with sake WOW...anyway food came in and I was shocked of the potions, they were huge and good quality was amazing. It literally took us 2 hours to finish food we ordered and sake. I would recommend you to try sweet and spicy karaage, really tasty chicken! Other than that huge place, clean and big washrooms so go and try!"}
{"text":"Very satisfactory. This is a family run restaurant so it feels really nice and cozy inside. Service was great! They were all very sweet and welcoming. I like how they start you off with the crunchy noodle soup, which by the way was very well executed compared to the rest of the jap restos in toronto. Their sushi was excellent too. They use very fresh ingredients and have just the right amount of rice. Their Korean dishes are made very authentically too, especially the spicy fish soup. My fav roll there is the Tataki roll. So happy a nice jap resto opened up in that area."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Their customer service is meh. After sitting for 10 minutes we had to ask for menus. We asked for a platter of sushi and said to not put fish eggs. The platter comes, and has fish eggs. They did replace it, which is nice. While the sashimi was good, the dynamite roll was super salty and the sauce on top was too creamy. I love sushi but have to say I did not enjoy my meal there the other day."}
{"text":"I recently stumbled on this Japanese restaurant as we were attending a Paint Night at Dunlop and Yonge.  I've so far returned twice.    The food portions are amazing.  The Kalbi is incredible.  The sushi is fresh.  They also have a children's menu however when we brought our kids, they only wanted california rolls and the like.    Staff are great."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place considering its kind of in a crappy plaza, lots of parking and excellent customer service, came here twice and I believe it is a mom and pop place....its a korean owned japanese place serving both food types...we tried 3 of their bento boxes and they are very very filling, they give you miso soup salad, noodle soup, fried tofu and spicy white carrot with fish....generous portions and pretty good food, loved their temperas and we got the tataki sushi which was hmmm hmm hmmmmm, prolly one of the best sushi places in richmond hill....also this is not a ayce place, their quality trumps those ayce Will come back again"}
{"text":"A small Japanese /Korean restaurant tucked in a small plaza on Yonge St. north of Major Mackenzie.  When you walked in, you'd notice the cute japanese setup and divided sections for each table. Because we were  seated on the other section on the far end side, our table has 2 service button on each end to call for service. Service is fast, staffs are friendly and nice.  We ordered the medium combo platter which consists of 28pcs assorted sashimi and 28pcs mixture of sushi and rolls, $49.95. Also got the classic maki platter which has dynamite roll, spicy tuna roll and California maki roll total 27 pcs $27.95. Sashimi are fresh and portion is good. Spicy tuna maki is really spicy! The only thing i didn't like is the rice on the maki or sushi, it's kinda dry. These platters came with fried crunchy seaweed(oily), miso soup, noodles with miso soup in a teacup(love this) and Japanese salad(fresh) . We also ordered Tempura shrimp(disappointingly small), Gyoza(taste good but just ordinary), and Kanpoongi (korean chicken with sweet spicy sauce). The Kanpoongi came out hot and really spicy so we ordered additional rice to go with it and I enjoyed having it together, really good.  Overall experience is good. Quality of food is mediocre. Pricey for the quality of food and amount of serving."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Richmond Hill! A quiet and lovely place to grab a meal.  One of my favourite Japanese restaurants to go to. The quality is good and I've never had a problem with my orders. You definitely pay for what you get!"}
{"text":"5+ stars for the food, 3 stars for the service -  We ordered the tataki roll, boston roll, and Uni shushi. All 3 dishes exceeded my expectations..I was especially blown away by how much food and how superb the quality is for its price.   The tataki roll is filled with scallop, and topped with torched tuna. The scallop melts in your mouth and the tuna adds the perfect hint of after taste. The boston roll was fancier than I expected it to be, with one of them topped with Uni (my all time favourite food). The avocado in the boston roll was very creamy. Uni sushi was fantastic for its price, $7 with lots of Uni on the rice! I will definitely come back again for all three of the dishes!  Serive is where we weren't too happy about. To be blunt, there wasn't much service. No one checked up on us or refilled our tea. There was a button for us to push to request for service, which was fine and absolutely understandable; however, our waitress never returned to our table (forgot to refill our tea) twice after asking for tea refill. In addition, it was just weird and slightly awkward to press the button 10+ for tea refill, tea refill reminder, etc during a meal. The server's attitude was very sweet and kind though."}
{"text":"One of the best places for teriyaki and sushi in the area, without a doubt. The price is a little higher than I'm used to, but that is in my opinion acceptable as the quality of the food is quite high.  The whole meal was delicious and our server was always pleasant and very kind throughout our visit. I will be definitely eating here again!"}
{"text":"Their Hwae Dup Bap, Galbi Soup, and Small Sushi & Sashimi platters are great. The place is clean, the staff are friendly, and price is reasonable. I approve this sushi house. :)"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and had the Medium Combo which was the sushi boat with a total of 56 pieces. 22 sashimi, 26 sushi, 3 piece spicy salmon roll and 3 piece cucumber avocado roll if I'm not mistaken. The service was great considering it was pretty busy and only two servers working. The sushi boat was very good, everything was fresh and it was a great price for all of that."}
{"text":"Note from palate: I like this place except for the sushi, stop ordering the sushi!   Service is courteous and friendly 5* Price avg Korean food 5* Sushi 2.5*   First dining experience was for Korean food amazing! second time was take out and forgot why I wasn't over the moon for the sushi and forgot why. So the third time for sushi again, I remembered it's not Japanese style and taste it's Korean style. If that's cool with your palate and stomach then you are in for a treat my friend cuz it's decent! But unfortunately for my tummy I let it down...again. My mouth wanted to taste the traditional Japanese sushi which has a   different flavor in the sushi rice to the sauce for the spicy ruin rolls. This place was either using the kimchi sauce or just plain Sriracha on the spicy rolls and it wasn't tasty as the one would expect, I had a hard time finishing my dinner. The texture and taste of the sushi rice also was not on par for Japanese style so again not what I was wanting.  But the Korean food here is authentic and the service is very polite and attentive, the restaurant for dinner is always mostly full and in a cozy atmosphere in a quiet plaza. I would visit again for more Korean food but skip sushi in future."}
{"text":"We got a tray of sushi as a take out. The sushi was great tasted good . Just one small comment make the pieces smaller that will make it more enjoyable, just my opinion. Definitely will order there again ."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Lots of parking. This is a casual place with both Korean and Japanese options. They have takeout available. You can pay by credit, debit, or cash. More of a family type run restaurant. They do not use fresh wasabi, not many places do sadly.   Menu - (4/5 Stars) Decent options, they only have limited variety of fish and/or shellfish. So if you are looking for something that isn't popular they may not have it. Be sure to check their menu online before going. Because this restaurant serves both Japanese and Korean dishes, they don't offer that many Korean dishes. But it is good enough if someone wants Japanese food or Korean Food they can either both.   Customer Service - (3/5 Stars) Found that their service is pretty random. Sometimes they can be attentive even when busy. While other times, when there are only three tables, the wait staff was less attentive. She was at the back of the restaurant or in the kitchen talking to the cooks/chefs. They do have a bell to ring for service. So, it is up to your own disgression on how you like your service and on the times you come. The staff is friendly.   Price - (4/5 Stars) Their prices are on the lower side compared to other Japanese/Korean restaurants. Good portion size for their value.   Quality - (3/5 Stars) Their prices reflect on the quality, which is why I gave 3 stars. I have tasted fresher fishes elsewhere. Not much different than AYCE quality, maybe slightly higher. However, if you want to be economical on sushi, then this restaurant is a good choice to meet that balance. I have ordered both Japanese and Korean food options, they were decent. The roll portions are good with the rice ratio, not overwhelmed with rice like some other places.  Presentation - (3/5 Stars) For Korean dishes, nothing really fancy, but for the Japanese, they were okay, I have seen better and more creative presentation elsewhere. It isn't poor, just average.   Freebies - water and tea, crunchy noodle soup, and a random appetizer from their kitchen, usually it is deep fried seaweed. Depending on what your order, you can also get house green salad and miso soup.  Items Ordered in Multiple Occasions - Tempura ($8.95) - It is okay, nothing specticular. - Lunch Menu - 6 pieces Spicy Scallop Roll & Spicy Salmon Roll ($14.95) reasonable price, since it included salad and soup - Seafood U-Don ($11.95), it is okay, nothing specticular.  - Chirashi Donburi ($15.95), not too much fish variety mainly salmon, red tuna, albacore tuna and white tuna. - Cold Noodle - cold buckwheat noodle with cold broth, half boiled egg, 2 slices of pear, sliced radish, 2 slices of beef, and julienned cucumber, serve with mustard and vinegar (Seasonal - $9.95) One of the few places that contain more than 1 piece of beef and pears, pretty good during the Spring and Summer seasons - Sushi & Sashimi Small Combo ($30.95) - Best for 2 people, includes soup and salad for both, pretty good deal and if you want more food you can order different rolls or an appetizer. Pretty good price compared to other places.  - Sushi & Sashimi Medium Combo ($46.95) -  Best for 3 to 4 People, similar to the above combo, but you do get uni (i.e. Sea urchin) at the time.  - California Roll ($5.95) 6 pieces, 3 to 4 cm in diameter good rice ratio, good size - Oyaji Bento - 9 Pieces of Sashimi and 6 Pieces of Sushi with Chicken Teriyaki. It is okay, nothing specticular.   Overall, it is an economical Japanese Korean restaurant, more budget or wallet friendly, which is one of the reason I do go back there to eat. But if you are looking for higher quality sushi or sashimi, then this isn't the place for you, especially if you have a picky tongue. You can taste the difference in quality."}
{"text":"After reading reviews on many closeby japanese restaurants, we'd like to give it a try and would say its food quality and the service meet our expectation.   Four of us ordered a medium size sashimi boat, sea urchin sashimi, korean bbq rice and the \"fire\" roll. The sashimi is fresh and includes a wide variety of fish and other seafood (including the sea urchin and shrimp). korean bbq is just nice and absolutely an perfect alternative for people who just want some hot food.   The bill went up for around $140 after tip, which is fair. I would suggest you should make a reservation before coming, because the place is kind of popular but not very roomy."}
{"text":"I have ate many Korean/Japanese places, but this restaurant is probably one of the best ones ever been to. We got the seafood pancake, sushi (forgot the name :(), and stir-fry noodles. The stir-fry noodles was the BOMB. I highly recommend the noodles to everyone. The portion was just right, not too big not too small. The staff members there were also very friendly, they were happy all the time and they were very well mannered. Reasonable price, and out side, lots of parking."}
{"text":"Edit - Been here very frequently that past fews months and each time got a stomach ache from their sushi.  Their cooked food is still very good."}
{"text":"Oyaji Sushi did a good job to give this location which used to be a Korean restaurant a brand new look. I love the deco and a lot of tables have partitions that give me a lot of privacy.  Lunch Special has 18 items to choose from with a good mix of Korean and Japanese dish and of course sushi and sashimi starting from $8 that includes miso soup and salad.  #9 6 pc Sushi with 3 pc of Spicy Roll and 3 pc of California Roll ($10)  Maybe because of the cold weather, I found I was still really hungry after finishing my lunch. The sushi is one of the smallest size I ate. Small piece of fish and where did they get such a small shrimp? Tuna was that funky looking pink colour. The roll though was quite good.  The side includes garden salad, seaweed salad and glass noodle salad.  Service was friendly and efficient. Either wave the staff over or just ring that bell by the table.  This review is based on sushi alone, so I will need to come back and try out other cook food option and specifically the Korean dish. Will definitely do an update after that experience."}
{"text":"Drove right by this restaurant when looking for it. It is tucked away and their sign isn't all that visible from the main road in the dark. I was there on a Sunday night for dinner with my family. My first impression walking in was that the place was clean, bright and well-maintained. We were the only table and two other parties came in while we were there.  They first served each person some miso soup, salad and some noodles. We, then, ordered the Oyaji Combo (meant for 2 people but can definitely be for more) and 3 additional rolls: the Tataki roll, the Oyaji roll, and the Tiger Roll. The combo came with 15 pcs of sashimi, 6 pcs of sushi, a dynamite roll, shrimp and vegetable tempura, 6 pcs Galbi, seafood udon and BBQ Salmon Head. For dessert, they served green tea ice cream which was done right. They froze each bowl so the ice cream didn't melt as fast. Overall, everything was delicious! And what made it sweeter was that the prices were very reasonable!  The service was also great. There was a bell at our table that we could press to notify the server to come to our table. The server was friendly, smiley and made the dining experience very enjoyable.  For the quality of food, the service and the cost, it'd definitely a (hidden) gem!... wish more people knew of this place!"}
{"text":"Oyaji sushi had perfect service and food!  When I walked in, I was greeted by the polite server who let my friend and I sit wherever.  As soon as we sat down the server brought out some nice hot green tea. The prices were a little higher than expected but still fair. My friend got the hwae dup bap and I got the chirashi donburi (15pcs sashimi on rice) sashimi was fresh and there was a nice variety. I tried my friends hwae dup bap, it was delicious! I know what I'm ordering next time! The highlight of the night was their service! The servers were super polite and frequently checked up on us. Also you'll get extra service with a yelp check in ;)  I will definitely be returning and I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"My first time in this restaurant. Almost missed it while driving and searching for it. Sign is too small. Not too appealing from outside. It's dark inside. But the food is the main thing. We ordered the medium combo boat for $46.95 which comes with 56 pcs of 28 pcs sashimi, 22 sushi, 3 pc California rolls and 3 pcs spicy tuna. I find the sashimi slices a little on the thin side. There's one fish that taste like tilapia. Not a good choice for sashimi. We also ordered the shrimp tempura appetizers. Staff are friendly. Other than that the rest are good. I'll come back to try the other dishes in the menu."}
{"text":"The food was good. We ordered a sushi boat, rice dish, bento box and some appetizers. All food was very good with good portion sizes. We were also given small free appetizers such as miso soup, salad and this small noodle in a cup all very good. We weren't sure if it was what we ordered that came with all these small free bonuses so I wouldn't guarantee they will also be given for others. (This was for dinner)  Overall the food was good service was nice and fast. Will most likely return."}
{"text":"-Great service: friendly staff, very fast in bringing out the food -Calming ambience -Beautiful presentation -Traditional Japanese atmosphere -Gyoza was juicy and crunchy: delicious -Miso soup was the perfect temperature and tasted great -Sashimi tasted fresh and was arranged beautifully -Meat was very soft -Stir-fried seafood and bbq beef short ribs a bit on the salty side, but with the rice was good -Great noise level, peaceful and able to talk comfortably in the booth. -If you pay cash, you get 10% off the bill  Overall, all the food was delicious, staff were very friendly, and I have no complaints. Would definitely come again, and highly recommend it."}
