{"text":"They've been putting a lot of effort into promoting, and I decided to give them a try this morning. I got a bacon/egg breakfast burrito that I had to throw out. The bacon was almost exclusively GIANT chunks of fat, and there was nothing in the burro other than the bacon and eggs. Positively inedible, and I'm not usually all that picky. Why 2 stars? The tortilla and salsa were great. Go figure."}
{"text":"Try Googling \"chili verdes Phoenix\", and you get 2,000 hits for places to get green chile _________ in Phoenix. That is why it has taken me so long to review this place. They should have called it something more unique, like \"Chili Verdeberto's\".  The generic name is only part of their problem. The location is a bit unfortunate as well. I've seen many businesses come and go there. Sadly, the spinning signs of desperation are already present - the flappy flags, the pennants, the offers of free tacos or coffee.  But I really, really want them to stay open. Chili Verde's is my go-to for a late-night last stop to pick up a trio grilled mahi mahi street tacos with pineapple salsa. It's the only thing on their menu that I have tried, and it's pretty good, so I get it every time.  Trust me on this, and give them a try!"}
{"text":"If you've a hankering for a taco, might I suggest taco bell?  I was enticed to try this place out by the guy spinning a two for one sign out front on my way home from Costco a couple of weekends ago. The food was still not worth two for one prices IMO. We ordered six tacos between the two of us and we started out by needing to remind them of the two for one price after they wanted to charge us $18+. Obviously they don't care enough to pay attention to their own marketing efforts.  Since there is no \"inside\" to this taco shop, we took our order through the drive through and went home. I was excited to try out their taco's, but disappointed after doing so. Even at the BOGO price, its still too much for a taco. They all seemed less than flavorful and in need of some serious hot sauce. Since their salsa didn't seem to do the trick, it's was a good thing I keep a selection of hot sauces on hand for just such occasions.   Because it's never a good sign when you have to remind someone about how to do their own job or needing to provide your own sauce to make something palatable, I'll leave this experience in the 'learning' category. I certainly have learned that I don't want to come back.  Happy Yelping Phoenix!"}
