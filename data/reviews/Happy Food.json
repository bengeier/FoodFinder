{"text":"Well what can I say...this place has been around for what seems like forever and if your hungry enough can be quite good. Especially, if you don't mind dirty tables, an occasional roach and a cashier that is a bit on the intense side. But on a normal day Happy Foods is less than satisfying, especially when you have more than a few choices of really good, clean Chinese food spots within the area."}
{"text":"One of the two most incredible Chinese p
Food spot I've ever been to.. and the other one is closed. I've been going here since 1990, sane lady, same people, same great food!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 1988 and I've always been very happy with the food. This is primarily a lunch Establishment with the best food, prices, and quality service in the Valley. This is the only place that I know of where you still can get a lunch that fills you up for a mere $5. The dinner menu is more or less identical to the lunch menu with bigger portions and an average of $1.50 more for each dish. The quality of food between the two different locations (Baseline and Central) are of the same caliber. You simply can't beat the combination of great tasting food, filling portions, and affordable price! This food is on par with both Pei Wei and P.F. Chang's except for the fact that it is far cheaper!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time last night after reading a bunch of reveiws on google. Alot of people dont understand that the culture that real Chinese are from. The owner isnt rude just very blunt and truthful. They dont want you to get the wrong things or over order because they dont like waste. Peopleare way to use to asian amercan fusion foods like Panda express, that when they have the real thing they arent happy with it... \"Oh the teriyaki chickin is saltly\" yes real chinese teriyaki chickin is saltly.... \"The food is served in paper and Styrofoam cup and bowls\" yes most real old fashion palaces serve it this way becase it cuts on cost. 
The food here is very good and very real. You get a great quantity and the fact that I took the time to find out things about them and just understand their culture made the owner, the younger girl and the cooks smile and were happy that we did. Thank you Happy Food for you authentic awesomeness."}
{"text":"I went to lunch with a co-worker. What the place lacks in glamor, makes up for in  really good food at  a reasonable cost. I've been coming here on and off for about 20 years and this was my co-workers first time. I checked the reviews since it's been awhile and found a mixture of both positive and negative. I told my co-worker about the reviews and he still wanted to go. I had the Happy plate and he had chicken fried rice. We both greatly enjoyed our meals and plan on returning."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I've ever had, and I always make it a point to go there whenever I'm in Phoenix. I always get the teriyaki chicken. Yes, teriyaki chicken isn't strictly Chinese food, but I have never found any better. Other amazing dishes: lo mein of any kind, sweet and sour chicken, house fried rice, egg rolls are great, and more. The place itself has a seamy vibe but most great Chinese food restaurants do. Hands down, if you are in the south Phoenix area and want some Chinese pickup, order from them. Takes about 15 minutes for them to prepare it and your taste buds will thank you. Plus, big portions so you'll have breakfast/lunch/dinner the following day. If you've got 4 people, you'll spend around $50-$60."}
{"text":"This place is damn tasty! Best Chinese I've had in Phoenix not an exaggeration I love this place!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a kid, love it to this day. Same ladies there every single time! Don't get scared if they raise their voice a bit, they tend to do that!  My personal fave is the shrimp low mein!"}
{"text":"I gotta admit - this was the first Chinese food place that my mom took me to and I grew up eating Happy Food... but i MUST admit... it's not that good. It's nostaliga that forces me to grant them another star. 

Located inside a very seedy and rather run down strip mall on one of the roughest intersections in the city, Happy food has not changed ONE bit since I was a kid, the same tables, the same wallpaper, the same bossy and quick talking cashier. But what has changed is the arcade games they have on one side of the resturant. 

There is a large glass topped counter with a box of take out menus and a register as well as their condiments and utensils but beneith the glass are photographs of their many dishes. My favorite is #23 Pork AKA Sweet & Sour Pork. It is simply friend nuggets of pork served without veggies or pineapples and the bright red sauce is served in a styrophone bowl for your dipping pleasure. Their egg rolls are awesome as are the chicken wings. My mom loves their Egg foo young and the cashew chicken. I the sauces of both dishes to be too heavy and salty. But that's just me. Everything on their menu is good EXCEPT the Mongolian Beef - it tastes... fishy. I couldn't even take a second bite. *shudders*

Happy Food is SWAMPED during lunch hour... so much so that they are known for denying orders placed after 11:45AM and it's impossible to get a table there - because they're all filled with patrons waiting for their take out. Sooo... call ahead or wait until lunch hour is over. because it's DEAD after 1pm! lol, I've seen it!

Their food might not be the best in the city, but they have a very loyal customer base who have been going there for years like me! It's a serious hole in the wall and offers decent food at very decent prices!"}
{"text":"This place looks like its been there forever, I walked in and walked straight out. They might consider updating."}
{"text":"The BEST Chinese food I've ever had its not so nice but they give you a lot of food and it's so good I LOVE IT SO MUCH."}
{"text":"By far the WORST dining experience I've ever had in my entire life.  Whatever you can imagine being bad...  it is.
I can't think of a situation where I would be compelled to even THINK about entering this disgusting cesspool again.  The proprietors should be ashamed to serve that mangy heap of flyblown buzzard bait and call it food.  And the service...  I've been mugged by people with better customer handling skills.  If Yelp would allow zero stars...  that's what this place would get.  In fact, they should incorporate a negative star rating...  that would be more appropriate.  Enough said.  Eat here at your own risk."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years... Even with my parents. This place is always busy , so you know it's good. Great food and service always!"}
{"text":"The lady at the front is mean and impatient, please know what you want before you approach the counter...or walk in the door for that matter. Everything is extra. No free refills. No outside drinks. No public restrooms. But the food is ok, good munchie food. Decent prices and good lunch specials. Too much of the food could cause upset stomach however...I think we go there because it is the only Chinese food place near us. However, we DO still go there...and the food is good when you are hungry. I think because of the history behind it, it is definitely one of the South Sides must do's. It is no Ming and Gee (Glendale, AZ)...BUT, people like it."}
{"text":"Old school west side fav on the south side! When we were younger Moms used to hit up this spot so as I grew older I would go with all my friends etc. I haven't been to Happy Food in years until yesterday. I had never been to the Baseline location before and my Papa Bear had never been at all! We ordered to share - 1 large chicken lo mein, a small crab puff (4) and a small chicken wings (6). The lo mein had good flavor but the noodles were over cooked and gummy. The crab puffs were just ok. Nothing exceptional about the flavor and the chicken wings were the STARS!.....Very moist, juicy, crunchy and flavorful. Definitely recommend those! Overall, a good meal and we'll absolutely return for another try on a new combo."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good you get a lot of it for the price. 
the teriyaki chicken is real Chinese teriyaki chicken. it is going to be salty, not sweet the sweet kind like you get from Panda Express (an Americanized version). 
I did talk to the owners and they did immigrate from China so your getting real Chinese takeout. She is really nice and if she seems abrupt and short with you, it's because she's busy she's just doing her job she's not rude she's just you know getting it done."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years definitely love this place. The shrimp fried rice and fried chicken wings are the best."}
{"text":"Traditional Chinese recipes which is great however when it come to cost I'd say the food is not up to it. The service is horrible and the food is only decent. I Won't come back that's for sure!"}
{"text":"It is a home favorite that I visit more then family  when I come From LA  everyone I bring in always come back...Its a family tradition that we stop here before heading back home...egg rolls to die for"}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want cheap, fast Chinese food. If you have a difficult time figuring what you want to get or what the meal looks like, their walls are filled with pictures of the food. It's super easy to order, fast and convenient. Nothing is over $10 here!"}
{"text":"It had some good reviews so i thought i would check it out.....naaaaaahhhh......wasn't good enough for me...as soon as we were ready to order( since it was 8:35 and they close at 9pm) the lady said \" we close at 9\" lol....wow.....like do you want business or not!!!! I could've went somewhere else but since i did have a four loko....i was a little not all there lol...anyway to make story short...you NEVER, NEVER TELL A CUSTOMER WHAT TIME YOU CLOSE ...I....the orange chicken i ordered was nice and crispy but it didnt have that orange spicy kick to it, i asked for brown rice and got white.....another disappointment. I wont b back..."}
{"text":"This place has fast service with phone call orders, they have never screwed up my order in 20+ years. Taste is great, prices are great and that's all you need. Don't expect great service, just straight forward customer service to fulfill your Chinese craving."}
{"text":"Very good food n swift service, it was raining outside tonight so this real quick to go food was perfect"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Perhaps not the best place to eat in doors but good take out food.  I would give it a 5 but not the best customer service or ease to order.  When you walk in you will see the menu displayed on the wall and each item is numbered.  So one assumes that the number correspond to that plate.  Well it doesn't.  Other than that and food itself is very good, and the portions are big.  Price is right."}
{"text":"I hope this place never changes or goes away. I love this place!!! :)

Just be aware of wait times, this place gets seriously busy!! Otherwise, this place is a joy and the food is so good! I'm getting hungry just thinking about this place."}
{"text":"Positives first! 
Food is always fresh, hot and ready quickly when I order carry out!
I have fallen in love with their pork fried rice! It is seriously addictive!
I come here at least 3 times a month just for this one dish & a small order comes out to $5.21 total.

Cons:
Price seems a bit high for the area of town and portion size.
However I don't mind paying for quality food. 
Staff can be short worded and not as friendly as one would expect however I don't mind because I only get take out so my interactions are limited. 

Go try this place its a for sure win!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese take out place in south Phx. We're been getting food here over 10 years. Same owners n same quality of food. Big portions too! My fav is the egg rolls, shrimp fried rice."}
{"text":"If you want to enjoy eating your food don't go inside. The place makes your skin crawl. And the food is pretty blah as far as I was concerned."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and really fast service. The woman in there was really nice. Good for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food, on the west side of Phoenix, and I've been coming here for almost 10 years.  I've tried other Chinese food restaurants in the area, only because they deliver, and I always regret it.  I wish Happy Food delivered, because I wouldn't be tempted to stray.  The food is delicious, and they have the best chicken fried rice.  It's always perfect.  I don't know why people complain about the price.  It's quite cheap, and everywhere else costs more.  I spend about $22.00, and the same items cost me $25.00-$28.00 elsewhere, and Happy Food is always better than elsewhere.  I've never had any issues with any of the employees.  They are not rude, or even chatty, but I go there to get takeout, I pay, then leave.  Customer service is overrated, anyway."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in all of Arizona! Highly recommend the pork fried rice and sweet and sour chicken #happypanda"}
{"text":"Okay! So this place is better than any Chinese food I've had here in AZ. I used to go to some spot off 91st and Thomas UNTIL I FOUND HAPPY FOOD! Lol it's always busy. Stays with a line (for takeout) cause the place isn't very appealing. The staff is a bit rude and unfriendly. But the food is worth it for me... The only reason I gave four stars is cause THEY DONT HAVE SIRACHI!!!! But I just take it home and use my own! Try it out."}
{"text":"this is my favorite chinese place to go so far. its cheap, local, and the food is awesome but its a regular old restaraunt. my favorite is the restaraunts special: a big ass plate of pork, chicken, and shrimp with carrots, water chestnuts, and some other vegetables that taste gross by themselves but irresistable with this plate. the order takers are two chinese ladies who are kind of hard to understand but like i say at all restaraunts: take ur time and make sure u know what u want. everything will go smoothly after that. what sucks is that theres not alot of drink choices but i like that they have alot of juices for the lil ones if you dont like them drinking soda. i love az iced tea. best time to come is lunch when they have all their specials on. if youre lookin for a chinese restaraunt, dont even thinki twice. jus go to happy food on 67th ave and thomas."}
{"text":"Cheap Chinese food, especially their lunch specials. The restaurant looks dirty, I was afraid to see the restrooms. My first boss always told me to look at the restrooms and you know how the kitchen looks. I got food for lunch for me and my wife. It tasted good, but we both regret it in the evening. Not going back there...

Go here if you like to spend your night in the restroom!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, even after moving to Scottsdale it is worth making the trip all the way over here. Best pork fried rice ever."}
{"text":"Been eating here for over 3 years and my last visit was about 8 months ago. I was waiting for my food pick up and well. Lets say there were a little family of Cockroaches crawling up and down the table. I got a little throw up in my mouth and just walked out. I know the place has never looked the cleanest. I draw the line at live insects in the building."}
{"text":"Great Ghetto Chinese food! Place is a bit run down but then again it's been there for years. Easy menu with lots of pictures. Make sure you ask for extra sweet-and-sour sauce cause they're kind of stingy with it"}
{"text":"The food is great. This time the customer service was pretty good and fast. I will definitely be back the best Chinese food in west Phoenix."}
{"text":"Used to always get their white rice because it was the best around. Their portions are really good for their prices. One if the better places nearby."}
{"text":"oh dear, I hate to be mean, but I am from Southern California, and, when I see the cardboard boxes and the little red & white to go containers, I have high expectations people! The orange chicken tasted like doughnut batter and the sauce was just weird. the chow mein was not authentic, the meat had weird gravy sauce. I honestly have never had this type of Chinese food, sorry!"}
{"text":"Have come here for almost 20 years. Egg foo young is the best. Egg fried rice and pork fried rice are also favorites, though a little greasy. Egg rolls are good. Note: if you get any sweet and sour, orange, sesame - chicken or pork, the sauce comes in a seperate container and the sauce is runny. If you say \"sauce together\" they thicken it up and add it to your protein. Just be sure that you are on your way to pick up quick, otherwise crispy battered chicken can get soggy."}
{"text":"This place used to be a customer of mine when I was in the linen rental business before I retired,food was always good and plenty for a reasonable price. I have to laugh about the comments about \"rudeness\" posted below,the owner lady is really the Chinese Version of Seinfeld's soup Nazi hang out for lunch there and enjoy the show you'll leave smiling."}
{"text":"Not bad at all! Love the BBQ Pork and crab puffs. Not a fan of the fried rice though."}
{"text":"I'm really into greasy Pork Fried Rice and this place supplies. I also love their medium-sized egg rolls. I grew up eating this stuff, but I no longer have a gall-bladder  serious. Buuuuuut, then again I think this rice-as-entrée should be paired with Hot Fries or Hot Cheetos and a Slim Jim. Throw in an Arizona Green Tea for hydration. Yupp. 

This place is super cheap and delicious!
You can also play the arcade game they have, classic."}
{"text":"Food is good, fresh, and fast.  Appearance is not good, but don't let that full you.  They have an A rating last time I checked.   If you live in the neighborhood, worth checking out."}
{"text":"Number 11 And a side of chili oil please! Thats all I reccommend you can call pick it up and leave! Lol 6022688010"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We used to eat here a few times a month, before I had surgery and can't eat it anymore  we call them \"happy bi*ch food\", yes, the owners are rude IF they don't know you. They are so nice to us since they know who we are from going in there. They've been around a really long time, so clearly they are doing something right! The sesame chicken am bomb, the crab puffs are really good, my boyfriend loves the Mongolian beef and the sweet and sour chicken. Seriously a good place."}
{"text":"Hmmmmmmmm..... i dont know about this place. A friend from work recommended it to me saying it was the BOMB chinese food. Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!! Hell Nahhhhhhh. Food looked like it was Ummmmmmm doggy dog food. It looked like Slop with the heavy Sauce over the food. Not tasty at all, AT ALL!!! The only two things i liked was the egg roll and the fried rice. But to that it wont make me come back for more. I eaten at better hole in the wall chinese food joints.

That reminds me, gonna slap my friend upside his head for recommending me to this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese food place in az. Simple great flavor sand best bang for your buck ."}
{"text":"The ladys here are hella rude but there food is bomb tho i love the Mongolian beef bowl"}
{"text":"I have had chinese, and then I'VE HAD CHINESE!  This was great food!  Best food is the fried rice.  No,..its not some fancy restaurant, but its the best.  I always call our order in on my way home from work and in 10 minutes its hot and ready to take home.  This is good food and I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had an Arizona thus far. Went there twice in one week. Sweet and sour chicken is the bomb.com"}
{"text":"The food here is always delicious.  A little bit pricey for being a small restaurant that is mostly take out. The portions are good and can usually feed 2 people.  Service is okay, but when getting take out it doesn't really matter all that much."}
{"text":"I spent $50 on food only to ask her for some sweet and sour sauce and her response was doesn't come with your order and $0.50 each. I was pissed off because I just spent $50 and you charging me extra for sweet and sour sauce. Never again will I return."}
{"text":"Yes I come to Happy Foods to order $50 worth of food and I asked for sweet and sour sauce. So she tells me that doesn't come with your order it's $0.50 extra. I just spent $50 and you could not give me sweet sour sauce guess where I won't be coming back to.... customer service skills none!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have been in business for over 30 years and theres a reason why. There food is good. Period.  Ive had several items, but the pork lo-mien is my go to. Crappy area, but dont let it fool you. They have good stuff inside."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever!  If you can get over the authentic Chinese customer service and forget the fact it is not 5 star - you will love love love the food!  Been coming here for 25+ years and I drive 15 miles just for it!  Best egg rolls and Cashew Chicken! Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Small little Hole in the Wall place with some of the Best Shrimp Fried Rice I've had in awhile. Bite size shrimp in every bite and served on a styrofoam plate that was overflowing with rice..."}
{"text":"They have the best sesame chicken I've ever had. Yeah, there's tons of other good stuff, like the Mongolian beef or vegetable lo mein, but I keep coming back for the same thing almost every time. Prices are reasonable; you can get a meal for 2 for like $8. Is it in a crappy part of town? Oh heavens yes. But that's how you know it's legit. Don't wuss out, go out of your way to try a tasty, local restaurant.

Service is really nice, and they get your order out with haste. I just wish they'd bring back the 80s arcade machines in the dining area."}
{"text":"best chinese food in Az .
. here 35 years!!!!! soooooooo amazing. so sweet lunch time deals are great"}
{"text":"Great place for carry out. I would ignore the bad reviews customer service is next to none. Have manners and they will to. Best pork fried rice and sesame chicken"}
{"text":"I am very very very picky I have been eating here since I was a kid and prefer it.  I literally am known by name at both baseline location and Thomas which I dont mind egg rolls with chili oil and chicken fried rice green onion extra please lol I love their sweet n sour chicken sauce on the side only thing is I love their batter it's so yummy especially when fresh my oh my is it good"}
{"text":"Food is good, customer service is horrible, they all have attitudes especially this older really thin lady"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Chinese food I have ever had in my Entire life. The fried rice was rice with soy sauce on it and heated up. The sweet-and-sour pork is cooked way too much and wicked dry. I took two bites and threw it away I'm sorry happy food but you don't serve happy food you serve sad food"}
{"text":"The food is good... bomb. but the people are rude as hell no customer service typical of most Chinese food restaurants u guess at least the majority  a the ones in California are always rude that's how u know it's authentic."}
{"text":"The food is really good , the price needs to be reduced or the portions increased but overall i enjoy my visits."}
{"text":"The restaurant was grimey and their menu was overwhelming. I was disappointed because it was American Chinese food versus transitional Chinese food. I figured I'd give it a shot anyway. The food was mediocre. Unfortunately, I won't be going back because I can get better American Chinese food at Panda Express which is cleaner and in a better area. I gave two stars because I was greeted and they were friendly."}
