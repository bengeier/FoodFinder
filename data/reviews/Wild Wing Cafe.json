{"text":"Great service so far. It's a Sunday around 8:30. We were seated immediately, and the waitress too our drink orders before we even settled into the booth. We ordered wings and the nachos to share. Ultimate nachos are plenty to share. Wings are always flavorful and hot. Oh and they're playing Real Housewives on one tv, Law and Order on one and the Olympics on others. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 8 on a Friday (today) 4 adults, 4 kids. Place was not full, maybe 70% of tables had people so sat right down.  waitress was nice and pretty good, a little slow with napkins and silverware though.  Seemed she was used to serving drinkers.  She recommended a good beer that was not on the list.
My gripes:
--kitchen ssooooo slow.  Our kids are pretty well behaved for elementary schoolers and they were saying, loudly, how hungry they were after 30 minutes after we ordered.  Finally food came... just the kids stuff!  ADult food came about 5 minutes later.  Food was hot though, so I don't put any blame on the waitress.  
--kids meals are *small*. The oldest kids were 9, and they were still starving after they ate everything.  And these are not big kids, just normal average weight kids.  The 6 year olds were still hungry.  

Goods:
--waitress, as mentioned
--food was good at least.  I had the veggie quesadilla though, which says black beans on the menu, and there were not ANY black beans in the thing.  Not one.  It was warm though and pretty good."}
{"text":"I really like this place and eat here often. The menu has a variety if things to choose from, not just wings. Everything I've tried so far has been pretty good. It can get pretty crowded at times causing a bit of a  wait but we have always been able to get in and out within an hour during lunch time."}
{"text":"Couldn't eat here.

Walked in to an almost empty restaurant and sat down. After a few minutes we were greeted by friendly staff and were brought waters. When we received our water we noticed things floating in my glass. Then noticed their 93 health rating score. We got up and left before the staff came to take our order. Totally disgusted."}
{"text":"Our poor experience with this restaurant started as soon as we walked in. We requested a booth and pointed at one and the hostess said you don't want to sit there because it is broken. So she seated us in a booth adjacent to that booth. Upon sitting down we noticed the table was poorly cleaned, so we just decided to wipe it off with paper towels. After waiting a few minutes the waiter greeted us at our table and handed us menus that were very sticky and torn half way down the middle. We ordered drinks and an appetizer that were very good. We then ordered our meal and waited and waited and waited. We finally got the attention of our waiter and motioned to him from across the room that we did not have our meal and he ran to the kitchen. He comes hurrying out with our food and said \"it was just sitting back there\".  The food was incorrectly prepared and was cold but we had waited so long we decided to eat it anyway without complaining. The food was delivered to the table without silverware, which we had to ask for. As we are eating we noticed fruit flies buzzing our salad. When we finally got our bill paid and were exiting our booth the adjacent booth collapsed on 2 customers. And to add insult to injury as we left the restaurant our shoes were sticking to the floor. Won't be back!  P.S. The restaurant was only moderately busy."}
{"text":"Most unusual policy I have ever encountered......

Tried to eat at this establishment, and it came up short.  

Two people in the party, and told that there was a substantial wait (Tuesday night) even though there were several open tables.  When we enquired with the hostess - there were several parties ahead of us, who could have EASILY been seated on the available tables, we were informed the a 4-top table required at least 4 people in the party!!

Not only do we not eat there, several other potential parties were leaving for the same reason.

Travel 60-90 nights per year, throughout the country, never encountered this silly rule.  Never coming back here.  Sorry Wild Wings - you lose my $$$"}
{"text":"I was there for the first time today with my wife and kids the atmosphere pleasant the food was good and reasonable priced the sevece was good it was nice and clean my wife enjoyed the all you can eat chicken bar the music was very versatile.It would be a place I would go to again.On the lighter side I would look to go with out the kids so my wife and I could enjoy a couple cocktails"}
{"text":"Lunch for two at 2 PM. We ordered 5 Fried Chicken fingers (with sweet potato fries) and a chicken sandwich with fries. The fingers plate was fine (besides the random onion piece in the bottom of the honey mustard), but the sandwich came out as a salad. Smh. He pointed out which one he wanted originally, and even wanted to show her on the menu when it went back to the kitchen. ... The sandwich that came out wasn't what was ordered (it was also missing the tomato from the sandwich it was suppose to be).

To be the only people in the place ordering food (others were at the bar and playing the golf game), the fingers and COLD sweet potato fries took 20 minutes and the (now to-go) sandwich took an additional 25 minutes. We were seriously the only people in there eating and our meal took an hour... When the place was dead!!!!

We also felt like our server was not thorough and did not pay attention. ... We even had to track someone down because we couldn't find any staff around.
Sad first visit considering we live right across the road.

Really disappointed. (Music was cool though. I.e. slipknot, godsmack, etc.)"}
{"text":"I visited this location last weekend at around lunch time. It was practically empty except the wait staff and 2 other tables which was fine with me. My server was very friendly and attentive so my drinks were constantly being replenished and she checked on me atleast every 5 mins. Now the food........I ordered the 12 piece wings with a side of fries. I did half and half wings with the Red Hot Bleu and Island Jerk Flavors. 
The red hot and blue wings were pretty good but the Island Jerk wings were disgusting and burnt to a crisp. They were just plain naked wings with some kind of spicy dipping sauce on the side. I was really disappointed with the wings but everything else seemed to be ok. I french fries were piping hot and the portion was huge. If I decide to return, I will not be having the Island Jerk wings again. They were just AWFUL!!!!"}
{"text":"My chicken sandwich was great, they seated 9 of us with 3 kids happily and the loud atmosphere drowned out any noise they were making. Not a classy joint, but hey."}
{"text":"Wow! Great food and even better service!! My waitress, Haleigh, was superb! I have a gluten allergy which makes dining out anywhere a bit of a challenge. Haleigh was so knowledgeable and able to give me lots of recommendations! This is the best, most helpful Wild Wing Cafe I've been to in the Charlotte area. Everything was very clean and the service was fast. All of our food came out just as we had ordered it, which is especially important with an allergy! I will definitely be stopping by again when I'm in the Epicenter!!!"}
{"text":"This place has fallen off. At one time my family were regulars. The final straw was our last trip. The place was cold literally freezing we mentioned it to the manager & we simply got a shrug of the shoulders. The place is filthy. The restroom is on the same level as a porta jon. The wings are so small they shouldn't have even been plated. We mentioned this to our waiter he simply said they changed vendors. Will never be back!"}
{"text":"Eh...   Good variety of wing sauces/rubs.  But it was average.  Plenty of tvs to watch football but they are very awkwardly mounted so you have to crane your neck to see more than 1 game."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for lunch on Monday. We were expecting the usual average food and atmosphere but it seemed like the adults had called in sick and left the place to the kids for the day.

I will start with the hostess who was running around the whole time with waitresses and the kitchen staff instead of greeting guests. When we were seated we were right next to the landshark surf board. I specifically remember the exact seat because there were dust balls attached to the wall that were flowing in the air. It looked kind of like seaweed flowing in the ocean. The table and floor was dirty too with napkins and french fries under the chairs. It wasn't busy so I cant imaging the staff was so overwhelmed with guests they couldn't clean up when people left. The dust thing on the wall had to have been there for a while to get that big. If the part of the restaurant the guests see is dirty what do you think is happening in the kitchen near the food you are about to eat?

After a while our waitress seemed surprised when she stopped over and mentioned we hadn't gotten our food yet. A few minutes later it came out and my wings were dry. If they soak the wings in hot sauce before serving them how long to they have to sit around to dry out? The whole situation was gross but we were hungry and the food was at least hot (maybe they warmed it up in the microwave and that dried the sauce out).

The whole thing was really disappointing because we both love wings, but at least there are other options around."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came to Wild Wing for the very first time and were not very pleased. Upon arrival sitting at the bar there were tons of dirty plates,napkins and cups that had taken awhile to be cleaned once we sat down. When it was cleaned off the bartender NEVER told us her name, asked if we'd ever been there before or informed us of any food specials or drinks. In the middle of our food it took a very long time to receive any refills. Lastly while sitting at the bar we noticed about 6 to 8 staff members hanging out at the bar on their phones and eating a taco bowl of some sort right in front of customers. Not in the back of the restaurant but right on the bar is where all of this occurred. I know I was not the only customer who noticed this but having previous restaurant experience we were never allowed to eat at the bar on the clock or not, have cell phones out or to casually stand around at any point. I was very disappointed with my VERY FIRST experience at this Wild Wing location and will never go back."}
{"text":"It is what it looks - a college sports bar. Our waitress was nice and attentive, but the table was sticky, our appetizer (onion rings) took too long to come out and the food itself was sub par. We probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. How hard is it to get silverware? By the time we finally received it, our food was cold. Our waitress had the personality and the speediness of of a rock, and the manager was made excuses for the poor service. Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Been there three times and SERVICE sucks.   Lack of attention from wait staff.   Waiting this time for 15 minutes and then walked out.   Never going back to this one again."}
{"text":"Since this initial review, my wife and I have become friends with the night manager.  She has taken the time to get to know us both, listened to countless suggestions, and put some of our suggestions to use.  Highly recommend Wild Wing, and it's great to have my neighborhood bar back."}
{"text":"I try to keep in mind this location just opened. But....the food was so salty that we couldn't even eat it."}
{"text":"The wings are very dry. No flavor and mind you I had 5 different sauces. Better off throwing 27$ away, I tried to give it away to the homeless and they wouldn't even take it. What a shame. Never again..... What a shame,really had a taste for some wings."}
{"text":"Good food, service and also a decent drink special. I typically go in and hang in the bar area (always clean, and friendly service) but have also entertained work folks there and has always been a hit.  Wings are good, with plenty of flavors, and you have to try the buffarella (sure i spelled this wrong). regardless, good stuff at Wild Wing."}
{"text":"Really tasty wings with a variety of flavors if you can get a seat with view of the tvs, a good place to watch some football. Like the wild wings I have been to many, many times in Charleston, it can also get some pretty decent local bands if that's your thing. Just keep this in mind though if you're expecting to be able to talk (or hear) before you go!"}
{"text":"Removing two stars for limited parking area and poor service. 

-Long wait for appetizers 
-Served food without providing any plates
-The food was not hot just warm"}
{"text":"Lookin for good food after a movie at Epicenter on a Sunday night.

The wings were meaty and tasty. Bigger than average. I got an order of 16 and could only eat 10 with a side salad. Got 2 flavors. Lime and garlic. Both were good.

Service at the bar was poor. Had 2 servers and was very slow. I had to ask for refills and service.

Dessert was terrible. I had brownie alamode. The ice cream was crystallized ice milk. Horrible.

Would not return/("}
{"text":"Place is a shit show. Absolutely zero organization. Really in need of a management change. Very slow service at the empty bar. Dirty dishes everywhere. 
Order a gin and soda, bartender gave me a gin and tonic. Was going to ask for it to be remade, but the guy never came back."}
{"text":"Brand new Wild Wing that a friend took me to.  The one thing this location has over the others is:  it is actually an okay location and it is clean.  Of course it is brand new.  
It is a cookie cutter of the others.  You pretty much know what you are going to get when you walk in...  For me, it is the overdone, over promised, under delivered product once again.  Mediocre at best food driven by cold beer.
Servers were trying their best and I do give them a big thumbs up for trying... being it is new and all.

I am sure they will find their place in the market."}
{"text":"Ever hear the statement, \"If their bathrooms aren't clean nothing else is\"
Wow were these bathrooms trashed.  Not just dirty, but over the top off.  

This is just a cheap, dirty place.  
As a sports bar I give it a 1 maybe 2 stars.  Tube TVs?  Are you serious?  Almost all of them were tubed... hello?  Welcome to the 90s.
Food is a 1 but I guess it depends on how much you drank.

Service was bad, and I mean bad.  The server even said so, which kind of made up for the bad part of it, but still... it was bad.

I find it kind of interesting that the server comes over with a leg brace on and freely tells us that it was due to a slip and fall in the kitchen.  Shocker... 

I honestly just can't see any of my friends ever pulling me back into this place.  
Parking-Sucked
Bathrooms-Sucked
Service-Sucked
TVs-Sucked
Food-Sucked (but was probably the best part, and it still sucked)

EEEK..."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch at 11:45am with nobody to greet us at the door. Sat down to a sticky table. Ordered 6 each of ragin cajin and lemon zest, but all 12 wings tasted the same. They were also dripping with oil and soggy. I asked for a wet nap because of the excess oil dripping all over me, and the waitress only brought a single wet napkin. Worthless, flavorless, dirty, nasty, poor service. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Wild Wing Café is a local family sports bar and restaurant serving Buffalo wings, food, and beer across the United States.


 34 Wings Sauces from Virgin to Braveheart!


 Good Place to watch Sports, have drinks and the best wings!"}
{"text":"The food was all right. But the service was horrible.  We went there with a group of 16 for my sister's 30th birthday. It was fine when we first got there but one of our people was in a wheelchair and thus made the night worse. First they wouldn't out a short 4 top in the section by the long high top(where we were). Then the manager refused to put enough tables together as we needed to keep them for other guests.  We were all eating and drinking.  No one was just sitting drinking water. So it was horribly awkward. The waitress was slow and inefficient. We got drinks one at a time and food was so slow some people finished before the others had their wings. No one knew where ye food went though the server wrote in order what we wanted. Meals were messed up. But worst of all we had to go to the bar to refill our water and sweet tea because NO ONE would come refill our glasses. The manager made us unwelcome though we spent hundreds of dollars. It was my first and last trip to this place. No thank you."}
{"text":"A very common type sports bar with great food yet very spacious. I have always had great service every time i go.. The bar is always stoked with tons of drinks and brews. Very knowledgable staff and TV screens everywhere you look with your favorite games always on. I really enjoy going here considering there is so much unique signage and memorabilia on the walls. Definitely a cool place for the college crowds to drink, Wing and the Chicken Feathers are absolutely the best in town with so many sauces to choose from that will have your head spinning. Definitely a great place to visit if your at the University Area and is located every so conveniently  off the Highway."}
{"text":"I got married today and I brought my very small family wedding party here for drinks. The woman sweeping the floor had her purse on her shoulder, the hostess barely said two words and we waited for over 15 minutes with not a server in sight. Everyone decided we should go somewhere else and a woman at a table whom had been on her phone with HER purse on the table the entire time told us good bye have a great day. I can only think she worked there for making that comment. The hostess did not say a word as we left. Thanks wild wings. We ended up spending over $400 at Fleming's. Good job"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good.  Wings are above average with some flavors that are awesome (Slayer, jalepeno chedder) and some that are unremarkable. Other menu items are excellent.  I recommend trying the LA Toaster sandwich at least once.  The wing bar is hit or miss--more often than not the wing bar is out of wings and you have to wait several minutes for a refill (which usually is short lived as the people waiting swoop in to grab the wings).

Service has gotten better.  I don't know if they got rid of the some of the problem employees or they quit, but I've noticed the servers that seem to have been the worst are now gone.  That's not to say there aren't bad servers there--but it's ALOT better than it was a few months ago.  During the lunch rush there does seem to be too much socializing at the host station--but whatever--overall service is decent.

Complaints: I have really revolve around the constant self-promotion over the muzak.  I'm already here, I don't need to hear the commerical every 5 minutes.  Second, there could be better training at the host station.  There is no reason that people should be waiting to be seated when it is obvious there are numerous tables open.

Bottom line: Definately a great place to eat.  Just don't expect quick service or something spectacular.  Of course, if you go to WWC expecting a Blackfinn enviroment--then you are the problem...not the resturant."}
{"text":"Love this place. Different flavor wings from mild to wings from hell. Cold beers good drinks and the food is really good. Always fun great music I highly recommend this place if you're in the area..."}
{"text":"Horrible serves, server never wrote anything down our order came out wrong and we ordered nachos which she never ordered I had to go to the server station to find her ask about the nachos. Ask for the check server just dropped on the table then walked away. Will never go back"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is small but it stays fresh and hot. So a good choice for lunch. Evening and weekend the service will be hit or miss. If it's during a sporting event the TV's will be blasting and food service seems slow.  Food quality is fine. There is a big sauce selection and chicken is available several different ways. Salads are good, cold, and fresh. I am getting hungry thinking about the food so we will be checking in this week."}
{"text":"We like the Spartanburg, SC location.  Good food and pleasant, but inexperienced staff."}
{"text":"I'm not from this area at all. So I don't know much from this area. I love the location and was very surprised to see how big this place. The wings were great. Nice and fresh. Order something small, the food is very filling. The service was a little slow, but I think it's because it's Christmas eve."}
{"text":"While our bartender was nice enough. Very forgetful. And neither her nor the bartender that came in after her knew how to do their job adequately. Food was good for bar food. The staff just didn't seem to be trained properly nor were sufficient enough to their job at task."}
{"text":"OK food with terrible  service and deceptive pricing.  We were seated promptly but it took forever for server to come by to take our order.  We told him we'd be ordering portions throughout our stay.  For the first half he was attentive. Then he disappeared.  Our last round of food took forever to come out and he clearly forgot about my beer order.  Come checkout time I was charged $5.50 apiece for my beers but menu said $5.  He was incredulous.  He said \"I'll go talk to him\". I saw him laughing with the bartender then he came back and said \"you can go talk to him\".  REALLY??!!  I am never coming back."}
{"text":"It was a real disappointment that I come to an establishment where I crave a simple thing which is chicken wings. I come in to get in a table and the hostess didn't even acknowledge us and just grabbed menus and started walking to the table without saying a word. Then I finally sit down at the table and asked about what flavored vodkas they had. They said they had none which was surprising since I had them before. So just to prove a point, I went to the main bar and asked for my drink. They magically had it which was phenomenal. I came back to my table and asked to speak to a manager in which he responded he didn't care etc"}
{"text":"This place is pretty uninspiring.  I feel like you can make anything edible with the magic buffalo sauce - but this was still pretty lame.  They have some all you can eat wings and tots bar during lunch, but I did not partake.  Next time I have a chicken craving I will probably hit up Chick-fil-a or Zaxby's instead!"}
{"text":"Just tried to get a table at Wild Wing Cafe for the first time as we are new to the area. Had the rudest experience since moving to Charlotte. Someone needs to explain to the hostest that her position it to greet people, let them know how long the wait will be and then take note of the parties' name. Unfortunately, she believes her position is to very rudely tell us she has no idea how long the wait will be and that tables will open up when the football game was over. We stated the game was in the first quarter and she then explained very slowly as if we were idiots that yes a table would open up when the game was over. Her counterpart then said the kitchen was really backed up so it would be way longer than 20 minutes. Guess Wild Wing Cafe doesn't want business from new people living in the area. Happily eaiting at Piedmont Social....they thank you for the business! #worstfirstimpressionever #wildwingcafe #piedmontsocial"}
{"text":"Always loved the Wild Wing franchise, but this one was SO DIRTY.  Food was good and server was pleasant but food took 25 minutes with only 5 tables occupied on a Saturday afternoon. Table was sticky and remained so even after cleaning. Floors had debris and restrooms were the worst I have seen. Makes me worried about the kitchen. We will never return."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worse customer service I have ever observed. Once seated it took the waitress over 10 minutes to ask what beverages we want and another 10 minutes to bring them. The restaurant was not at max capacity. I would not recommend eating here at all."}
{"text":"This is a pretty much American Food average place.  Nothing really to shout about.  They do have karaoke on Wednesday and also have other events like live music, beer pong, poker and other miscellaneous events throughout the week.  The place could be amplified if they had better drink specials in my opinion, something the place lacks.  They have a pretty big patio too, so some outdoor events would be nice to make the place more lively at night.  Food is hit or miss in my experience.  Fried pickles were horrible, but the nachos and fried mushrooms were off the chain.  Good college hangout or a place for local apartment people.  Just an average joint in my opinion.  Too many of these chain places in Charlotte already..."}
{"text":"Was a Buffalo Wild Wing fan but started going to this Wild Wing Cafe recently and loved it. The atmosphere, people, food, and beer all make it great. The manager there when I usually go up, \"Fitz\", is a riot and will make sure you have a good time. I have never been there and not had a great experience. Also the trivia on Wednesdays is awesome!"}
{"text":"ordered a shot, received an imitation. Mac n cheese was straight from the blue box, to the microwave, to my table. won't be doing this again."}
{"text":"FAITH IS AN AWESOME BARTENDER.  The lunch special- 20 wings, a plate of French fries and a salad///////  12 bucks. AND IT WAS GREAT/////WTF DO YOU GUYS WANT.  24 oz beers for 3 bucks.  This place is worth the visit."}
{"text":"Come here for the first time see how they are try to order a mixed drink they didn't even have the right stuff for it ordered another one it takes it nothing but like lemon ordered a rum and coke and it was all rum order two orders of the boneless wing 12 piece when was rolled and barbecue sauce other one was in Teriyaki didn't even look like they were rolled in anything order cheese fries didn't get it until halfway done with our meal then appetizer server didn't really know what she was doing either thanks you need some more training probably will not be back"}
{"text":"So yes, I realize that I am a Veggie, reviewing a place called Wild Wing Cafe & normally a place like this would rate 2-Stars for having like 2 menu items I could order..... 

But I knew what we were getting into when we walked in & I knew it would be a challenge to eat here & my coworkers actually CHOSE to take me here after & told them multiple times I was veggie so can't really fault the restaurant..... and the fact you offered anything veggie at all, earns you a happy 3-Stars

Veggie options consist of: 
Fried Mozz Sticks 
House Salad - but I had to ask they HOLD the bacon bits 
Baked Potato 

Coworkers [all nasty carnivores :-) ] are regulars here; they have the frequent diners card; & they looooooove this place 

Chicken Wraps, Shrimp Skewers & Burgers were the day's choices & they all raved about how delish their lunches were - clean plates abound

Also passed by a buffet, filled w/ different wing flavors - people all around w/ plates piled-high w/ wings so I can def vouch for the popularity of this meaty cafe

My plain house salad was plain, plain, plain iceberg lettuce but *lots* of cheese so there were def points for that....but maybe a carrot or tomato would have been nice too

But NO bottled water?!?! What's up w/ THAT?!?! 

So overall this is good for the \"regular\" folk who like meat & drink soda or sweet tea but if you're veggie who likes bottled water & are hankering for a sandwich or something other than a plain salad or potato, try elsewhere

We SF people are SO spoiled & picky!"}
{"text":"my first charlotte review....me and th came down to check out my new pad and working area and we were in the mood for some wings and burr..so we hit up what was closest and this was the place...i had the garlic garlic garlic, fajita something, and bbq sauce...horrible descriptions i know....but i was satisfied with the meal and the wings came out fresh out the fryer and were plump...my friend told me he likes the flats...i asked whats flats and its the one thats not the mini drum stick....WHO KNEW"}
{"text":"Cool place to come watch the game, eat , and drink beer! We stopped in Sunday to watch the football game. Great service , friendly staff. There was no wait and great seating with every game on. That was a crowd pleaser. They also had a DJ. The food was okay, I got the chicken feathers with grilled veggie skewers. It was close to $13. My fiance had wings, fries, and a beer. We paid $30. Kind of pricey but again if your a sports fan its well worth it."}
{"text":"Great live music. But poor service from the front door to the table. And dirty! Lots of trash and old chicken wings under our table."}
{"text":"Its what you would expect. The lunchtime wing buffet is a good deal. They no longer use a buffet line but make your wings to order in any flavor. Good deal."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!  Service is terrible, management has no service recovery skills.  I would recommend avoiding this restaurant until they get their stuff together.  We waited over an hour to get our order and it was wrong.  Waited another 45 mins to get the correct order and food was cold and look like it had been thrown together as an after thought.  Manager brought our corrected order and didn't even apologize.  Our waitress \"Amanda\" spent her entire time talking with another table who were obvious friends and we had to flag down others to bring us needed items including silverware.  Was a total bust for a birthday lunch."}
{"text":"I'm giving this establishment 2 stars because although the service was horrendous..or shall I say our waitress Sierra was horrendous, the food was great. I will start off by saying that she took our order and we got our drinks and that's the last time she came over to check on us. I had to constantly look for her bc our drinks were out and she was upfront talking to her coworkers instead of near the back where she had 2 tables that she effectively ignored the entire time. Needless to say it was unpleasant. Hot wings with no drink and a waitress who was not concerned at all with her customers. Service terrible...food was great though."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere in this place. Great Customer Service ! A great chill spot to eat if you're hungry after watching a movie in Charlotte, North Carolina. I highly recommend this place. It's open until 2AM."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in Monday night at 10PM and ordered immediately cause we were hungry. There was probably 3 tables here in total including ours. We waited way over 45 minutes for overpriced & small 12 wings and a turkey sandwich. Their food is fine but this was unacceptable.
Last time we came, no one sat us for 10 minutes and my boyfriend had to go search out for someone to seat us. Again, food was fine but this restaurant is not organized.

A lot of good wing sauces to choose from and nice server though."}
{"text":"Came here for my 21st birthday. I was with two friends and we got 1 beer, 2 tequila shots, and 2 cocktails. The bartender, William, was so kind and paid for my entire tab because it was my birthday. He was such a sweetie! The atmosphere is super cool and pretty inexpensive!"}
{"text":"I'm on a never ending quest to find good wings in Charlotte so I was surprised I didn't visit this place sooner. It reminded me of a Buffalo Wild Wings knock off but luckily I love BW3's so that's a good thing. It was quieter than I expected when I went on a Saturday night (especially quiet for a football night) but again, thats a good thing. Efficient service which was appreciated seeing we were going to catch a movie right afterwards. I found at these types of places you sometimes have to flag your server down which definitely wasn't the case here. There was a decent crowd but you could definitely carry on a conversation, watch a variety of games and enjoy the food. Speaking of which, I was pleased with the wings --I got the Gold Rush flavor which is a semi hot honey bbq and the sauce was tasty and the wings weren't all fatty how some other places are.

All in all, a good place to get some grub, have some cold ones and watch some ball. From reading the other reviews, I need to hit this place up on the Buy 12, get 12 wing night!"}
{"text":"We usually sit at the bar, and that always been good. This is the 3rd time we've sat in the seated area and everything is absolutely terrible. 

Our service was awful, the drinks were unusually bad. I don't have high standards for alcohol, and my rum and coke was undrinkable, the soda was beyond flat. 
We had to wait about 10 minutes for plates and silverware while our appetizer got cold and then after having to ask a second waitress, we got 3 plastic forks (there were 4 of us) 

Drinks took forever to arrive and my husbands margarita was completely forgotten about and never delivered after we ordered it. 

He went to the bar to just order a beer and the bartender didn't even acknowledge him so after about 5 minutes he just gave up. Not to mention the tables are SO sticky. 

Idk if it's cause it's a football preseason night or what, but this is the last time we will be coming here. Terrible"}
{"text":"THIS IS A REVIEW BASED ON ONE BAD EXPERIENCE AFTER MANY MANY GOOD ONES!

Let me start by saying that my family and I have come to this location for YEARS.  My husband AND my father (and now most of the rest of the family) LOVE the wings here... We generally split a couple of big platters and a few house salads... great food and a good relaxing atmosphere with WONDERFUL service...

HOWEVER - Yesterday (Father's Day - Sunday, June 17th, 2018) we came with the same number of folks as always (7 adults, 3 kids)... We were quickly seated and ordered some cold sodas.  I didn't notice at first as I've been getting over a cold and thought it was just me that was warm, but the A/C was off... we were told that it was (A) broken, and (B) had been broken for a few days.  Right off, I'm not happy that they're open as this is a Charlotte summer and it was way upwards of 95 degrees and counting.  They had no fans going, and they refused to open  up the doors to the outside for a crossbreeze... 

In any case, and against our better judgement, we decided to tough it out in the name of Father's Day and wings.  We ordered at 5:20pm... the restaurant was NOT full nor very busy (largely due to the A/C being broken)... by 6:20pm (yes, an hour) our SALADS had not yet arrived.  My mother suggested (optimistically) that we move to the other side of the dining room to be out of the way of the sunlight.  After discussing it with the staff, we moved... and then, my salad arrived along with one of the many plates of wings.  Firstly, my salad plate was HOT.  I mean as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp hot... And the wings on the plate were dry, shriveled, and looked like a disaster.  At that point my husband and I had had enough... We told the family we should try another restaurant, we offered to pay for our drinks (the server refused our money as she wa beside herself with anxiety), we tipped our waitress who had done NOTHING wrong... Apparently, the kitchen was understaffed (again, probably due to the A/C being broken)... and she was profusely apologetic.  

I did not see anyone who seemed to be a manager.  At no point did anyone in charge come see if we were ok or apologize for the wait or lack of cool air... I have NO idea who runs the place, but when your air conditioning goes out in June in NC, YOU CLOSE THE RESTAURANT.  I cannot see how being open was either legal or sanitary.  The longer we waited the more we each started mentioning how if it was this hot out in the dining room, the kitchen had to be a nightmare... and with raw chicken meat, that's not a recipe for a healthy gastronomic experience.

In short... I won't be back until I'm good and sure that they have their proverbial ish back together."}
{"text":"Monday, two of my coworkers and I ate here. We should have known it was bad when during lunch there was no one in there, well one guy at the bar. Our waitress was decent, no personality. Our food came out and we just had a bad feeling. The place was disgustingly dirty. Ever since Monday, all 3 of us have been sick, unable to hold much food down. Not sure what this place did to the food, but it obviously destroyed all 3 of us. If you want food poisoning please go to this place! If you don't, then STAY AWAY! They need a serious deep cleaning of this whole place!"}
{"text":"Awful place. Service absolutely sucks. 45 min wait for 2 on a Monday at 1:15pm?!? I counted at least 8 uncleaned, empty tables. Piss poor management. Not only will I not ever return to this location, I will not ever go to another one period. Great job guys."}
{"text":"This is a good place to visit for lunch. I never been to this location before today and was shocked by the size of it when I walked in---it's huge! They have a wing buffet for lunch for $9 or $10 offering wings, tots, mac n cheese, etc. so thats a solid option to get if you are looking for some quick.

Their Gold Rush is my favorite flavor (honey bbq with a little spice) and I want to try others but always feel the need to stick with old faithful. I got the Buffarella wrap today and it was fresh, spicy and filling and the name left me feeling extra girly. And they have steak fries, which just rocks. Reasonable prices for lunch but my only gripe was having to flag down our server for our check---being lunch with limited time we had to get back to cubicle land!"}
{"text":"Me and my two kids came for late lunch to enjoy the wonderful chicken wings. It was not our first visit , although it's been a while. Our waitress Suzanne was very pleasant ,helpful and quick. We have definitely enjoy the time. Thank your."}
{"text":"Good food.  It's very large, slow on weekdays so don't think you're gonna party there but it's a good place.  Menus changes a lot so it stays fresh.  Staff was a tad on the slow side considering it was dead but she was super friendly.  Overall a good joint for some wings and a couple brewskis"}
{"text":"If u looking for a place starring Patrick Swayze come to wild wings .its loud real loud feel like I'm in the vip the music is good the for all ages"}
{"text":"Came for lunch with coworkers and it took about 40 minutes to get our food. When it finally came out it was old and dry. The broccoli had brown spots and the onions and mushrooms were very dry. The restaurant was basically empty too..."}
{"text":"So we checked into this restaurant and the wait for 2 dad with 4 kids was 30-40 minutes. We decided to walk next door to dennys. What a debacle. Read that review on their page. An hour later we walk back into wild wings and ask how long the wait is. With a 25-30 minute wait, The hostess remembered us! She immediately sat us and our kids. We had appetizers in only a few minutes! It took a while to get our food but they were packed full and super busy. It still was a better experience then the other restaurant we tried. I happen to like the wild wing food. But the service I received was just phenomenal."}
{"text":"I went to Wild Wing Cafe this weekend for the first time in a long time due to poor service and I must say they really stepped up their game. Our bartender Ned was so awesome,  fun to cut up with their service was great it was 110% better of an experience that I've had the first several times being there and I feel like giving credit where credit is due. I don't know if it's new management or what  ( the new GM Chris  stopped by the bar and spoke to us to ensure our visit was up to his standards  he was super friendly and professional ... really gave off a  we're all friends vibe  which is what you want in a bar ) the live music was great it was a fun atmosphere ...they've really Turner act around and for all the people saying it's not a good restaurant need to give it another shot. Restaurants have to work out their Kinks. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I really hate to give a bad review because I love the space. We had Queso for an appetizer, it was very good. But that is all the good things I can say.   Emily was our server.  She was distracted and did not do her job.  Waited for a beer for over 20 minutes. She was sitting at a table with a man. Had to ask the server who brought our food,because it wasn't her.  She then brings the beer and offers the explanation that \"someone\" was supposed to tell me they were changing the keg.  Ummmm. You are the server, was that someone supposed to be you?  My nuggets were overcooked and difficult to eat. Husband's wings were also dry.  Probably won't be back unless there is a band we absolutely would love to see.  And we won't be there to get a meal."}
{"text":"Took 30 minutes to get a side salad and a chicken salad.  Both salads were poor in presentation and I got the impression the kitchen does not care.  The bar tender was a space cadet and could not make a gin and tonic.  I have had way better."}
{"text":"I used to go to Wild Wing Cafe all the time when I lived in Southwest Charlotte.  I LOVED their food, atmosphere, and prices, plus it was close to home.  Since moving, though, I hardly get an opportunity to experience Wild Wing anymore.  There's this one in the University area now, though, and I've gone there only a couple of times on my lunch hour.  Why only a couple?  Mainly the wait time.  Both times (once probably 2 years ago and once just this week) I've gone there during lunch, the restaurant was practically empty, and we still had to wait 30-35 minutes for our meals after ordering.  Seriously?  Did the cook not show up?  Is he/she still hung over from the night before?  Everything on their menu can probably be cooked in 5-10 minutes.  Maybe it's time to hire some new cooks?

On the positive side, I was very impressed by their expanded menu.  I already thought they had an extensive menu before with lots of fantastic choices, but now Wild Wing has even more goodies to choose from.  I went with an old standby, though:  \"Chicken Feathers\" (grilled chicken fingers) with China Syndrome sauce (mmm...spicy!).  You can get either fries with your feathers, or celery and blue cheese.  But you *cannot* get fries AND the blue cheese (for the spicy chicken) without paying an additional 50 cents.  And don't even try to request another tiny cup of extra sauce.  That'll be another 50 cents, please!  Luckily, I've learned my lesson over the years, and Wild Wing does a pretty good job of coating their chicken with sauce anyway.  

My partner ordered the Bleu Cheese Basil Burger.  He said it was one of the most amazing burgers he ever had, so I tried a bite of it.  He was right.  It was amazing and SO full of flavor.  Italian marinade, crumbled blue cheese, and basil mayo = freakin' fantastic.  

I guess most people who go there at lunch go for the all-you-can-eat chicken wing bar.  Some dribbled in as we waited for our orders.  I overheard someone stop one of the servers to remind her that the bar needed restocking as well.  Seriously, what's up with the kitchen at this location?  Shouldn't management be all over this?  I'd love to frequent Wild Wing more often at lunchtime, but I'm pretty soured on having to take an hour and a half for my lunch break just because the cooks can't grill some chicken and fry some fries in less than 30 minutes?  I can understanding waiting if the restaurant is busy, but when there's only 2 or 3 tables filled in your huge restaurant, come on...

{"text":"Been going here for 4 years.. Going downhill fast.  Poor service, dirty and food quality has gone way down.  Stopped in today.  Bathrooms were dirty,  service was slow and food was not what it used to be.  The \"new\" items on the menu were \"new\" 4 years ago."}
{"text":"The boneless wings are terrible. Food is mediocre at best and prices are definitely not worth it. Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Especially in a working suburb like the UC, lunch should be tasty, easy, and (above all else) fast. People out here aren't looking for fine dining (and Lord knows, Wild Wing Cafe is not fine dining) but they are looking for something fast and convenient. Ostensibly, this is what WWC offers. On a slow Tuesday at 12:30 pm we were the only customers in the place. They must have shut off the ovens, because our simple orders took more than 30 minutes to arrive. That's not okay. I cannot devote an endless amount of time to this enterprise; my lunch hour is finite.

And the nachos weren't even that good."}
{"text":"1st impressions are everything right? Well I will never return again. I'd love to tell you about the food, I'd love to tell you about the beer, however, I can't. Saturday 3.22 a group of 6 of us entered wild wings at around 11pm. We were quickly sat by a hostess. That's pretty much the end of our experience. We sat at our table for 20 minutes trying multiple times to flag down a server, manager, leprechaun, or anyone who would get us food and drink. After 20 minutes of no success we left saying how bad that was to the girl at the hostess stand, we were shrugged off. The next day I sent wild wings an email.... It's now Thursday, no response thus I assume you don't care about your customers."}
{"text":"Finding Wild Wing Cafe when I moved to Charlotte from Orlando in 2004 was a blessing.  I was a regular at Florida's Ale Houses and missed their Zingers (chicken fingers smothered in hot sauce that you can't find just anywhere).  Wild Wing Cafe was the only place in Charlotte that came close.  WWC has over 30 sauces to choose from -- mild to \"wild!\"  My favorite sauce?  Jo Jo's Red Dragon Wing.  It's sweet and spicy.  And when I feel daring, I order the China Syndrome sauce...but pay for it the next day.  Oh well...  Live in the moment!  

The prices for their apps and entrees (sandwiches, wraps, salads, wings, fingers, etc.) are fantastic.  Top it off with a beer on special and you've got yourself a cheap night out!   

David's Chicken and Friends (diced chicken, hot sauce, bacon, cheese, and ranch dressing on top of nachos) on the appetizer menu makes a great entree to take small bites from occasionally when you're sitting with friends drinking beer.   And for you health conscious people, they have \"chicken feathers,\" which are unbreaded, grilled chicken fingers dipped in sauce -- also a tasty treat!  (But you have to order an extra side of sauce -- for 50 cents! -- because the \"feathers\" don't hold onto the sauce like the regular fingers do.)

Now onto the bad...  In the past few years, this Wild Wing Cafe has lost their liquor license 2 or 3 times (I've lost count).  For a place you go for wings and beer...that's not good.  Wings with Diet Coke just isn't the same.  And this resulted in server turnover...and poorer service from the new recruits.  Hopefully they're getting their act together and will revive WWC to the fun place it once was.  Also, parking here is a nightmare.  There's one small parking lot which usually fills up quick.  You're better off parking on the street into Ayrsley or in the lot across the street.  

All in all, WWC is a fun, inexpensive, good-tasting place to go for a casual meal with friends.  Be sure to check out their website for a listing of nightly specials.  Especially on Tuesday nights when they have \"Buy a Dozen, Get a Dozen Wings Free!\"  And don't forget the sports events and live music throughout the week!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. At best, it's alright. I wouldn't want to rush back here anytime soon though. Typical American food (check), loud atmosphere (check), average waiters (check)."}
{"text":"Since Whiskey River wasn't serving alcohol anymore we went over to Wild Wings. There wasn;t anyone at the door so we weren't sure if they were still open but we went to the bar. Our bartender was very nice and the drinks were good.  The place is big and the whole staff seemed nice."}
{"text":"Expensive, wings were pretty awful and the service wasn't too great either. If your going to spend the money, don't go here..."}
{"text":"Waited 15 min for drinks, waited over an hour for food. Waitress was awesome but everyone supporting was horrid. Food was okay, but when you're starving cause you've waited so long anything tastes good."}
{"text":"For the second time in a week I went to WWC and had issues with my orders. This time was the last straw though. I will NOT be back! I ordered 12 wings (Wet) got home, bone dry. Call in and was told to come back for a replacement order. Get that one and can see the sauce leaking through the box....get home, it's all oil. AWFUL! NO celery NO blue cheese. WTF?!?!?"}
{"text":"Good food - wings, hot shots, etc.. Service leaves some to be desired - depending on when you go.  There's some great servers for tables.  Bar definitely could use servers who enjoy their job more and people more.  They tend to talk only to the other servers - pretty annoying for travelers."}
{"text":"I would give them a 3 at this time.  I thought the wait staff did a good job and the food came out really fast.  The place was clean as well.  I give it a 3 due to the fact the food to me was ok, I have had better at other Wild Wings so they are still learning.  I would say they will be a 4 in no time.  I would go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Got there and it took a while for the hostess to seat each individual party. 

After sitting it took 20 min to someone to even come up to us and we ordered drinks and food all at once. She was nice. However, after waiting another 50 minutes we asked about our food and it was third in line to be cooked and would take around 20 minutes. We decided to get up and leave at that point.  

We then went to 5 Guys next door and got our food in around 15 minutes."}
{"text":"When I go for wings, I prefer to pretend they're not actually from a chicken. While I'm not a fry-gal, please grill, bake or fry my wings so I am not reminded that it once had skin on it. Well I took my work team here before a Checkers' game since we had some picky kids with us who apparently love Hooters (and I refused to take a work group to Hooters) so I thought this was a good choice. Uck. The wings were so soft that you can see where each feather is plucked out. Blech. The sauces tasted good, but the wings seemed really under done and the meat in the middle was oddly chewy. I definitely prefer wings at Quaker Steak and Lube, Lebowski's or even Burger Co.  Odd.

As for the rest of the crew, DH went for the healthy option and got a grilled chicken breast on rice and that poor thing got the most anemic looking meal ever and it was tiny. As soon as I saw it I knew he would be hungry. 
Luckily the dad in the group who brought his Hooters-loving sons got a massive platter of wings, grilled \"feathers\" and tenders so there was lots leftover DH could munch on. Apparently the breaded  tenders were a massive hit and were quite good (and why it wasn't a 1-star review).

As for service, we had to ask if we could place an order and when the server came back to do so, he literally said \"Whaddya want?\"  I think he was irritated that he was wearing coveralls and a cowboy hat for country weekend. Anyway he warmed up very slightly during the meal, but it was definitely evident he did not want to be there, which made us not want to either."}
{"text":"Went to Wild Wings for the first time back in May for a meal of wings. They were offering Tuesday buy wings, get free wings.. My roommates and I had them and we all enjoyed them. The service was slow, but the wings were well seasoned and the bbq wings I had were great."}
{"text":"Never again.

UGH...I absolutely hate giving bad reviews. I mean, there always has to be something good about the food or experience...to act as a saving grace to the review. So to be fair, I would have given this place at least 2 stars because our waiter was very attentive and they had a live band Saturday night which was awesome. 

However...here is where they lost the star...my food literally made me sick. I opted for the turkey burger and fries and it didn't look appetizing but I figured not to judge a book by its cover. It came out on a multigrain bun, lettuce, raw red onions and chipotle mayo.

I can only describe the taste as bland and rubbery. Very unappetizing. To top it off the fries were not crispy or hot, so that was very bad as well.

The longer I sat there the more my stomach began to hurt and I ended up paying for the meal all night.

Not good, and I don't see any redeeming qualities and I have no plans on going back."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of the Epicenter, but if you are downtown anyways, this is certainly a good choice for watching a game.  No way I could give 5 stars with $15 parking.

No sports last night, but bought some apps and some beers after hearing about the battle of the bands.  Great music, cool vibe, friendly service, and a wide variety of bar type snacks.

One note, didn't really see the sign when walking up, but saw the emblem in the frosted windows."}
{"text":"Ordered to go through grub hub. It came extremely fast but the order was messed up. Ordered buffalo chips, got plain chips with a side of blue cheese. Nothing even remotely Buffalo. Paid for extra ranch, got no ranch at all. Buffalo wrap was soggy with hot, bitter tasting lettuce on it. Won't be eating here again."}

{"text":"The food is good the wait time to be seated sucks, the service is super below average they could do better. No one has a sense of urgency. Good luck getting a drink at the bar when you sit down unless you're a regular. Took forever to get my drink but they are quick to drop and pick up a check. Oh don't bother trying to call in a order for pickup it's faster to drive there and order they never answer phones. I've tried calling one night for over 15 minuets on my way home. You think I got anyone? At that point I was over it and it was too cold to get out and wait another 35 minutes to place an order. Do better, service is key to maintaining your customers or else this place will probably go down soon."}
{"text":"Went inside on a Sunday and the place was dead. Should have known there was a reason why. The food was absolutely terrible. The wings dry and hard. The fries rubbery and cold. Took one bite and decided to go somewhere else. Will not be back."}
{"text":"The food looked like it was prepared in old grease and had a taste to match. Wings and fries were over cooked and dry. It's cheap but you definitely get what you pay for. I won't ever be back. I would rather not eat at all."}
{"text":"Wings and Steel Town spuds are pretty good here. Fun environment. Always busy, which isn't a bad thing. Parking here sucks as you can probably tell from other comments. Also, prices have gone up recently which makes them a little overpriced compared to other wing joints."}
{"text":"The only sound in this restaurant are the grumbling of people's stomachs because of slow service. Literally there is no background noise. Very uncomfortable. None of the waitstaff seems to care, or in the kitchen for that matter (cold, soggy hamburger buns, mozzarella sticks with no cheese inside of them). For real a terrible experience and this is the only review I've ever done. Something had to be said. I've been to a different location that was very good but this was complete garbage, disappointed we even had to pay."}
{"text":"Husband and I visited Wild Wing Cafe for the first time, yesterday. This will also be the last time I will go back there! We ordered to-go and sat at the bar to wait for our order. 

I observed the bartenders dip used drink glasses in water, wipe them off with a napkin, and place them back in the glass rack to be used again. The hanging glasses looked very dirty. One of the bartenders made a drink but forgot to put salt around the rim. The waiter who was taking the drink to their customer, reminded the bartender that she had forgotten to put the salt around the rim.

The bartender had an attitude and got another glass and dipped it into this nasty contraption that was opened with water and salt in it, she then poured the drink into the new glass!

The whole bar area was sticky and dirty! 

My husband ordered the mild flavored wings and I ordered the ginger flavored wings. Both were awful! The ginger wings had no taste to them. When we got them, they were already cold, which means they had been done for a while but no one bothered to pick them up and bring them to us faster. We waited for our order for about 25 minutes!

In situations like this, I always point to the manager as the culprit! Poor management translates into poor service! Never again!!!"}
{"text":"I like wings.

We stopped in here before a concert and had a pretty good experience. They had a great selection of wings on the menu as well as other items. I had the Gold Rush and the Wild West (marinated in ranch, not saucy). The Wild West were a nice twist from the usual flavors. This place is much better than a Buffalo Wild Wings. 

We sat at the bar to get faster service and were well taken care of. Our waitress disappeared for a few minute before we ordered, but the other staffed picked up for her. The server spilled some ranch when he brought our order out, but he was quick to apologize and bring more.

My wife had a flatbread and salad, but wasn't a huge fan of the first. She did enjoy the salad though. She did steal a few wings and liked those.

Not a bad place to eat if you are in the epicentre area and looking for a casual,affordable and tasty meal."}
{"text":"FOOD: 4/5 STARS
SERVICE: 3/5 STARS

I've only been to this location, and I've only ever been for lunch during a week day. The all-you-can-eat wings for $11.99 draw me in. The wings are pretty solid, and they have a lot of great sauces. I'd definitely recommend the jalapeno cheddar (really not too spicy), the gold rush, and the crazy daisy.

Service here on the other hand is extremely slow. Don't come here if you're in a rush. Doesn't matter what time of the day, or if it's empty or packed ... always slow."}
{"text":"First thing I noticed when ordering a dozen Buffalo-style chicken wings was that 70% of the leg bones were broken on my plate. I then asked my friends if they saw anything similar within their orders and they all replied yes. So, let's just say, if you find cruelty to animals unappetizing as I do, you probably don't want to eat here or anywhere where this supplier chicken parts is used.

Beyond that, the wings were standard fair. Nothing special. Standard beer selection.The place is filthy. I don't expect to be visiting there again."}
{"text":"Been here twice....my first and last time! Cold, rubbery tenders. Service extremely poor and no one cares about the PAYING customer. Glad they aren't the only Wing place in town. Buffalo Wild Wings will keep my 3 night a week business."}
{"text":"My Family made a stop by Wild Wing Cafe after a Panthers game. Drinks took a little longer than average but soon did we know it was only the beginning. Waited 30 minuets for appetizer before contacting the Manager. He was kind to promptly bring out the appetizer although at this point on, we received zero service from a manager or waiter for the remainder of our time in the restaurant before finally getting up and just leaving without receiving our entrees. over an hour later might I add.

Worst restaurant experience we have ever had - no Exaggeration
I blame management - No care in the world and you can see this carried over into the employees. Employees checking their phones every 5 minuets when drinks are empty and no food on tables. I am appalled. We were very hungry and upset leaving this establishment. Will never return. 

Isn't there a TV series that helps Failing restaurants? Prime candidate right here!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill in the past year. I live uptown and every time I go it's not busy but I get slow service.  Today my family went and again no one else was there and the service was slow and food was awful.  Me, my son and daughter got home and had upset stomachs.  Never will I eat there again."}
{"text":"Definitely love this place... clean, affordable food, not to mention live band every other weekend... only drawback is that other than weekends not much is going on here... maybe cause of the particular location i go to but meh. still all good.... the wings are definitely to die for.... spicy Asian and Caribbean jerk is serious business.... definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"We came over here to eat lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The place was not busy and service was a little slow. Additionally they seemed to have run out of silverware so they gave us plastic ware, which is a little strange. The ambiance seems good but I did notice that they could give their ceiling fans a cleaning...there were chunks of dust hanging off of a few. 

Ok the food... This place is not allergy friendly. My friend ordered the char grilled chicken salad. Apparently everything cooked on the grill here uses butter. They did not offer to cook the chicken or anything in a pan, so sans chicken was her salad. And they charged her full price for it. I ordered the chicken feathers, and they tasted like gas or fuel used to light the grill. I tried to cover it up with blue cheese but that didn't help. My fault for not sending it back. On a positive note, our other friend enjoyed the buffarella chicken wrap and my husband really enjoyed the wings. And it's always a plus when there are wet-naps and soft napkins."}
{"text":"As the meal progressed the service got worse.  My wife had to find the waitress (who was playing on her phone) to let her know we wanted dessert.  I joked that our ice cream was going to come out melted because the waitress would never check on the food...yes the ice cream came out melted.  If you have all day to wait, this is your place.  If not, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"What an all-around great place to go! My buddies and I go here often to watch football, go for Tuesday trivia nights, or just for a casual lunch. Also makes for a great casual date if you're dating the type of girl that's into wings and sports!

The wing selection can't be beat... they've got about 20-25 different sauces. I like BWW, but the selection here is much more complete. I'm one of those people who enjoys extremely hot food, so my choices in sauce may be different from yours; I typically go for Habanero Hots or Chernobyl, or at mildest the Hot. Anything else to me is boring, but everyone's different. If you want to try the Braveheart, I would request just one to start with. I could put down a few of them but definitely not a dozen of them. They are VERY hot.

I am somewhat of a wing purist but I have heard great things about the boneless wings. The few times I've had other things on the menu, they've always been good quality-- chili, burgers, etc.

Great beer specials too; this location has been doing $3 Sweetwater draughts for a while now (Sweetwater Blue and 420), which is usually what I go for.

Definitely stop in and give it a shot; one of the best wing places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars I would. Ordered 18 bone in wings, different flavors, and received 18 boneless nuggets all jumbled together in one box with sheets of paper on top. Ordered and even paid for extra ranch and received one. Who uses one ranch for 18 wings? When I called back to tell them the order was wrong the manager (Octavious?) proceeded to argue with me and tell me I was wrong, even though I had the order receipt in my hand. Terrible customer service and food. Also ordered a sampler and it came with half of the items missing."}
{"text":"Two hours waiting for two hamburgers, a fajita and an appetizer... during recess from a nearby and widely advertised convention."}
{"text":"Shouldn't even get a star b/c I usually get to go a lot and evidently you must need a masters degree to add extra celery now b/c I get it all the time and they told me I couldn't have it and one one my orders was wrong and b4 I could place another order the girl was pretty much done w/me. They need to hire people w/some common sense and stop hiring people who acted like they just got off the party from the night b4. When I called to tell them about them messing up my order the girl didn't even get my name or even care to apologize to me. Won't go back for a while."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of the service at this location, but I'm in love with the Flaming Parmesan wings and there are so many games going on that the so-so waitstaff isn't a distraction."}
{"text":"I came in on Valentine's Day  because they have $5 salad on Wednesday. My trainer bragged about this place so I decided to give it a try. As I sat and waited for my salad, I noticed floors that could've been cleaner, and overheard conversation I probably shouldn't have from someone who worked there.

I ordered the chef salad minus the ham. It was ok. It didn't knock my socks off. It was a salad. My trainer said they are larger if you eat there so I may go back just to see if that's true. Otherwise, I'm not busting down the door to get back in there. OH...speaking of doors. When I arrived no one was at the front. I stood there a while before someone came up to assist."}
{"text":"Every once in a while, I'll get a \"hankering\" for wings & want the variety that only Wild Wing Cafe offers.
Luckily, this location is the closest one to me.
My favorite wings are lemon pepper, wild west, red, hot & bleu, ranchilada, & island jerk.
The employees here aren't the best, they're not very attentive. Even trying to be seated, you can't find anyone to seat you.
The layout of the restaurant is spacious, I never feel cramped."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken tenders, waited an hour then was told they didn't have tenders.. this was the worst experience I've had at a restaurant.. I never post a review but this place is very unprofessional and unbelievable.. they all the sudden had no food to order.. after waiting an HOUR!!!"}
{"text":"Drinks are good! We were upset that  they don't serve food after 11:00pm. We weren't planning on going there but just ended up there while at the Epicentre. Next time we will come earlier for the wings. They make a great apple martini."}
{"text":"Great place to end up on a Friday and/ or Saturday night. I staggered in here after a Checkers hockey game and listened to a cover band with a few buddies. 

Very conveniently located in the upstairs portion of the EpiCenter, the interior layout of this uptown location is pretty snazzy. I've been out to the Wild Wing in the university area and was surprised to see (what seemed like) a little more square footage at this location. The food and service are pretty good here for what few times I've been. The atmosphere is very much like any other low-lighted bar. The crowd varies throughout the week and weekend, especially on the weekends when live bands are booked.

In addition to food, I am always pleased with a late-night restaurant that carries over drink specials into a Friday and Saturday. This is kind of a big deal if I have a DD and want to get a few. 

Overall, a great restaurant for late night, but also any time of day really. Pretty sure they validate parking also."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town on a college football Saturday. The servers had no clue how to change games nor did they care. Took over 30 minutes to get an SEC game and everyone just said \"I don't know I just work here\". No management in sight. Food is average. Service below average. Cleanliness below average and you can smell the smoke inside from the outdoor smoking deck. This certainly isn't a sports bar. I'm sure if you want to sit at the bar and do shots its a good time."}
{"text":"the wings were ok, some the sauces for the wings were good like the honey lime siracha. 
the buffalo chicken salad.....that's another story......just check the pic out...smh....this was in my salad!!!"}
{"text":"Well, I've eaten here plenty of times and the last 2 times....I don't know what happened. I love wings and hopefully this place will be my goto spot..BUT last 2 times I ordered....the wings had hardly any seasoning on them. The waiter actually brought more seasoning out to the table....really!!!?? 
And what happened to the size? I don't eat large wings, I like them normal medium size. I did not enjoy it at all, spoke to the manager who confirmed they used a different vendor for the chicken and thats why they were larger....the guy at the next table chimed in and said yeah...I noticed that too!
Will give this location another chance....there are other locations"}
{"text":"Wings were really good. I had got the regular wings with gold rush and china syndrome sauces. The fries were good more like wedges. My henny and coke was a little weak but that's ok."}
{"text":"Our waiter was great but the lady who dropped our food off was rude and didn't ask if we needed anything else. She dropped the food off and walked away. Not to mention almost EVERY time I eat here, the wings make me sick. I've learned my lesson this time and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We came in for the grand opening yesterday! It was great! We go to Wild Wing Cafe in Charlotte and when we lived in Forest City, we used to go to the one in Spartanburg. For the first night the food and service couldn't have been any better! :) It was super busy, but the staff did good and the wait time wasn't too bad! We sat right by the stage. Tokyo Joe was the band, and they were so much fun! As far as the food goes, if you want wings, get gold rush sauce!  The best appetizer is steel town spuds (fries). Will be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Sunday after a home football game, they weren't overly busy (thank god) but they were still overwhelmed. Server (Laura) was really nice but was set up to fail. Tvs were weren't tuned to the late games until half time?!?! Unbelievable!!! Bathroom was disgusting. Food was alright. I wouldn't go back, they need management help big time"}
{"text":"First Visit.  Wings were great.  Lots of flavors and crispy.  Liked the setup. Leadership needs to get every thing on point with obsession on overall cleanliness especially in restrooms.  Trash was full and lots of moisture in floors in Mens room.  The food and beverage choices are great and there's no reason the staff can't turn it around and get on track.  Need more teamwork to focus on friendliness and looking out for each other.  Every one should care about all of the customers and communicate with each other.  It's a wide open place.  Just keep your eyes open and everyone will be better served.   We'll be back.  Impress us next time so we want to keep coming."}
{"text":"Good service, good food.  Only gave it three stars because they don't give you enough dressing for the wings, then charge you 50 cents for a second one and two something for Ice tea..  Got the cherynobyl wings.  They were hot.  She warned me, tried to talk me out of it.  I like it that way, so they were good."}
{"text":"Ordered 30 wings to go. Got home and when we saw the size of the wings we're amazed. They were so small that in reality it was the equivalent of maybe 15 normal size wings. Used to go here a lot. Will never go back again"}
{"text":"I gave it a two star because the food is always so good but the wait for a server to get to your table is crazy! I went last week and it was steady not to busy but not dead. Me and my 3 year old waited atleast 30 minutes for someone to come up and this was after I got up to ask who was serving us. The server got there we ordered a lemonade and water and since the wait was so long I ordered our food at that time, the food got there in about 10 minutes of that and we still have her to receive our water and lemonade, I had to go to the bar to get our own drinks. When the food was brought out it was brought out by a different server and we didn't see our server until she brought us the check. We got our own refills from the bar and had to ask a different server for different things! Worst experience ever and it was all because of they sever! I left no tip, I server for 5 years and to see this server on her phone sitting at other tables talking and not checking on us or making us a priority at any point makes me want to never return!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this review after countless visits with the same issues in different forms. Your order will more than likely be wrong or you will have a long wait if you dine in. 

I called in an order and was given an estimate wait time of 30min. No issue I arrived about 35 minutes later , the order was ready. The issue it was the WRONG order. Completely inaccurate in an effort to speed the process I tried to call and now no one is answering. I give it a few minutes call again they pick up and hang up. I was upset and requested a full refund. 

The service every time I have dined in or out is slack and pure sorry and lazy. At some point and time you have to take accountability and make the right wrong with customer service recovery and employee training. The manager on sight refunded us however I would advise to not be a patron until some re training is done with the staff."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointing.....

Not sure I have ever seen such a poorly ran establishment. We arrived on a Saturday evening fully expecting a wait, was told it would be about 30 minutes.  No problem. We quickly observed there was numerous open tables and while we still didn't say anything a family of 4 arrived shortly thereafter with a special-needs son.  To our shock they were advised 45 minutes, with absolutely no consideration and again by now there were more open tables. Not sure they realize what that family has to do to prepare for an evening out. Absolutely un-called for. 

Needless to say, we walked out and have no plans on returning"}
{"text":"For starters I love the atmosphere at this location.  It's more of a neighborhood gathering place on the weekends.  They have 3 stars only because my last visit to the bar.  I wasn't serviced right away sitting at the bar, took them about 15 minutes to come up to me and when leaving I waited on my check forever it seemed like.  Business was not overly busy at the bar.  I come here for the wings.  I absolutely love the wings and knowing they having many gluten free options on sauces is a super plus in my book!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. Came with my family on vacation. Pretty much all of our orders were wrong. The waitress even came back to triple check what I wanted and still got it wrong. We also ordered appetizers and I don't know about anyone else but appetizers come first not with the meal.....kinda defeats the purpose. I don't know about the wings but the rest of the food really wasn't good. At the end the checks were separated and were wrong and my aunt got charged my moms bill on her credit card even though she had her bill in hand and my mom already paid. Bad night? Maybe.....not worth the hassle or money though when there are a few other places to eat in the complex. I will say though that they were pretty nice."}
{"text":"food is ok if u can get it.  rarely do they stay open their posted hours.  mostly close around 11pm.  do what u say and say what u do.  very unreliable."}
{"text":"Good service but the \"dry rub\" wings are terrible.  Wings are overlooked, hard, and not labeled.  We complained to the manager but he refused to change them.  

Definitely won't be back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  On a good note, our server was great and kept drinks full during our hour long wait for food.  Restaurant was pretty much empty so wait should not have been long.  My order of chicken salad sandwich was never even brought out and 15 minutes after the rest of our party was served, it came out with warm chicken salad in it.  Turkey avocado wrap came out with no avocado, side of tots were never served and the mozzarella cheese sticks must have been flash fried because the cheese had 'magically' disappeared from inside.  Will never try this place again!"}
{"text":"I would give you a 0 if I could. You have the distinction of being the only restaurant I've ever walked out of unserved. Our waitress brought drinks, tea and  glass of wine. We waited about 40 minutes. We ordered 12 wings. We noticed that a family with 3 small children that were there before us and still hadn't been served. We saw our waitress socializing with another customer, but why not?  She didn't have any food to serve. We paid for our drinks and left. The manager chased us out the door but he didn't offer anything to help. Just an \"I'm sorry\". What a terrible experience!  I won't go back. Bad thing is, I've been to this franchise in other cities and it was a favorite."}
{"text":"We love wild wing cafe from Atlanta & Raleigh but we terribly disappointed when we stopped here during our trip to great wolf lodge.  Other than our waitress this place was horrible.  The men's room was disgusting.  The broccoli and celery were rotten and we to send back.  Our table had no finish on it so everything stuck.  This may be a fun college bar but not a good family choice."}
{"text":"The wings are great! We had the garlic and the lemon pepper and both were good. The blue cheese is phenomenal, it's garlicky and among the best I've had. The celery was fresh and if you visit as many wing spots as I do you know this isn't always a given. I saw the reviews and am always up for a challenge and I'm here to say whoever scores this place bad is wrong, it's a great sports bar with great sports bar food. If you want the food and service of an upscale place, go there. This is neighborhood-like, mixed crowd, welcoming, and has good service and good food."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 2.5 star but three as being reasonable. Pricing is typical like any other franchise restaurants. Very disappointed in the wings since they are small and your paying more than what you get. Better off going to Buffalo Wild Wings or Hooters. My order was off by 2 wings and had to wait for my waitress to come to let her know and corrected the issue. Customer service is decent but needs a little more communication at this location since no one is on the same page. Also got a salad for order and no utensils. Had to wait almost 10 minutes to get the help I need. Would give a second chance since taste was pretty good."}
{"text":"The food is ok. But I have never been to a bar that has put me in a bad mood. The bathroom was out of toilet paper in the ladies room. There was no sound in the restaurant for at least 20min so we sat in an awkward silence. The bartenders attitudes were so bias and negative. I sat for 30min before anyone offered to refill my water or asked if I wanted another drink. I actually heard the bartender say it was going to be a \"shitty night\". The only reason that this place is still in business, with the attitude of the staff, is the fact that they are in the epicenter and tourist are going to come here regardless. Never coming back again. Wack."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some GREAT wings this is the place for you! I love wings and this is my favorite wing spot. However, if you are in a hurry or starving do not come here because they take forever to serve your food.
Honestly my stars are only towards the food and the price. I have been here so many times and when the service is not horrible it is just okay, but those damn wings keep making me wanna come back!
On Tuesdays they have 2 for Tuesdays which means whatever order of wings you choose you will get double for the same price! Like buy one get one free. 
My husband and I both chose 6 wings and ended with 12. I had honey mustard and garlic, garlic, garlic. My husband had honey, lime cilantro and some spicy Parmesan flavor. 
Of course we both loved our meal, but as mentioned before it took forever for the food to come. 
I will be back here for sure, but only for the wings :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time dinning in this location. 
My husband and I got there around 7pm the restaurant was busy but not too crazy.
Our waitress was the best! Very attentive and helpful she gave us some tips about the menu and we placed our order. I had the garlic garlic garlic wings and my husband the shrimp tacos. We also had the loaded chips that were AMAZING!
The wings were great too. Wild Wing Cafe has the best wings in my opinion.
The only thing that got me a little disappointed was the fact they don't have the two for Tuesdays where you get double order of wings for the price of one order.
Other than that I have no complaints and definitely will b back :)"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. My chicken sandwich tasted like a bar of soap. Sub par service and overpriced food. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I came here for a friends happy hour bday event. It was okay but honestly I wasn't all that impressed. The wait staff was mediocre and the food that was laid out was okay but I've had better bar food. The drinks were decent and their beer selection is decent but overall I wasn't really impressed with the place. Parking is limited and really a pain so be aware of that as well.  The location is convenient to my work but overall I don't think I'll be coming here again unless a friend insists."}
{"text":"Well I thought everything was fine until I realized they screwed me over. I went in at lunch, ordered wings and fries and then after I was finished found out there was a wing special that was cheaper and included a salad. The bartender \"forgot\" to tell me. The card she then handed me with the special was so old and torn up. This is not a new special. Make sure you ask. Otherwise they are just trying to run up your ticket."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. By far my favorite place to go for wings in the area. They have a huge selection of sauces and a few runs. I like their platter where you can choose 5 different flavors. Also their loaded fries are good. I typically go late at night as they are one of few places open after 11pm."}
{"text":"I used to love this location. I have visited many times, frequented during my lunch hour (as I live and work in the area) and always had fairly good service. It took a lot of convincing to get my fiancé to agree to go with me as he had a bad food experience from another location (it made him sick). I FINALLY get him to go with me and we decide to sit outside as it was such a nice day out. After about 15 minutes of sitting out there, a hostess finally came out to talk to us. Not realizing she was a hostess, I asked if we could place our order as we had been sitting there for a while. She took our order (by memory) and explained that our actual server (Jackie I believe) was in the weeds. I apologized and said we can wait, she said no big deal she will get everything going. Just to point out, I watched her do this with the other table who came out on the patio, there had been another table, but they got up and left after waiting about 15 minutes with no greeting. 

 I will give credit where credit is due, and our food came out timely, although I watched our appetizer be taken to another table and put down in front of the guests only for them to say, um this is not ours (again it was not our actual server and or the wonderful hostess bringing the food out). Our meals were then brought to us by a man who we both believed was just another server and or host. He did ask us how things were, but since we thought he was just another server/host we just said fine. Our actual server checked in on us twice and the second time we asked for our check since things had been taking so long we figured asking for our check at that moment might get it out to us by the time we were done eating. We thought wrong.

 After another 20 minutes, finally I became impatient. I went into the bar and asked for a manager, the man who had brought out our food stated he was a manager (news to me as he never advised us of this before). I told him that the service had been very slow and we had been waiting for our check for quite a while. He explained to me that our server was behind and I explained that I did not care just please get me the check as we have things to do. He advised he would take care of our check to which I stated, no there is no need, we just would like to pay and leave. He then stated that if I had an issue, I should have let him know from the beginning. I was in shock that he said this, but I just said \"Ok, please get me my check\" and walked back out to my table. 

 I told my fiancé what happened and he said \"He talked to you like that?\" I said, \"yes, it really caught me off guard.\" My fiancé stood up to go in and have words with the manager as he did not like he was basically talking down to me. The manager had already started to come out to the patio when my fiancé asked why he would rudely talk to me. This is where I became completely baffled. The manager actually started arguing with us, stating that if we had a problem we should have let him know. I explained to him, he doesn't have a pin or anything that shows he was the manager so we didn't know. He then stated very sarcastically \"well I'm sooooo sorry I don't have a pin that says I'm a maaaanaaaageeeerrr\" I looked at him like he was nuts as I have never been treated this way, especially by a manager. I explained to him that both my fiancé and I had been servers and we know how things work and if someone is this behind, you find a different server to help them out. He basically blew me off, which again upset my fiancé. At this point my fiancé did drop a curse word and asked the other table how their service was (to which I explained to him was not the best idea, however he was beyond livid at this point). The argument was becoming heated and I finally stopped the manager (who again I couldn't believe was arguing like this, we simply just wanted him to not give us excuses and say I'm sorry but he argued and talked down to us which is completely unacceptable). I asked if we could simply pay and leave as this was crazy, and he said \"I'll just take care of your whole meal!\" Now mind you, he said this very rudely and loudly almost like we were just there in attempts to GET a free meal, which was not the case, we pay for our meals every time and we tip very well having been servers before.... we just wanted to leave as we had spent far too long there, had things to do, and were now being yelled at by the manager for reasons that were not our fault but the restaurant's itself. 

 We walked out and just felt so frustrated and embarrassed. It was like we were watching an episode of Kitchen Nightmares where the manager argues with the customer that they are wrong which in every episode that happens, it is pointed out that kills the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here only a few times but not enough to really know the restaurant well. Today my wife and I went at lunch and the waitress suggested the wing bar. I was starving so I thought ehh why not. Well after only getting 6 wings because they were low and I was being considerate I never got to get anymore. People were lining up inside the restaurant to get plate full after plate full and were even still eating while standing in line. I was on a tight timeline for lunch today so I learned I'll never do that again. Even our waitress was getting irritated and was asking people to stop standing at the bar waiting on food. I feel like I was ripped off. Came hungry and left hungry!"}
{"text":"When my dad and I had come in we had ordered drinks and then she left and came back and we ordered food. She then asked what drinks we had ordered and it had been 8 minutes and she didn't put the drink orders in. I ordered the Guacamole as an appetizer and it was really good, nice and cold and seasoned well. my dad and I had finished the guacamole and the waitress hasn't been seen since. She came with our food in about twenty minutes and I had a Grilled Chicken sandwich and my dad had 2 grilled shrimp kabobs and 2 veggie kabobs. Towards the end of our meal my father had asked for a water and she forgot twice to bring it. He then asked for the check and we left. The food was good but the service was terrible. The only thing that came fast was the check."}
{"text":"First, the food was okay. Nothing to rave about.
Second, the service was absolutely horrible. There were six people in my group, we all showed up within 30 minutes of each other and half of them had to wait about 15 minutes just to get a drink. Our server, who's name we didn't know, was pretty slow. She brought all our food out separately, and didn't even bring out one of our group members side item at all. When it was about time to go, I asked for the checks and she only gave me my check, so I got my card out and was just going to clarify that everybody wanted their checks, not just me. I sat with my card and check in my hand for at least 15 minutes. I made eye contact with my server twice while I was waiting for her to come back, she didn't come back either time or even give acknowledge me. She eventually gave the rest of my group their checks and took our payments.
Third, overall the cleanliness of the restaurant was okay. The floors were dirty, but it was a Saturday night in a sports bar during football season. I wasn't bothered by the little dirt that was on the floor. I was bothered by the ceiling, the ceiling looked like it hadn't been dusted since the building was opened. I couldn't get a clear picture of the dust, because it blended in with the ceiling. It was absolutely disgusting though. If I would have noticed that before I have started eating, I honestly would have left. I don't even have words to explain how gross the amount of dust accumulated on the ceiling was.
Overall, I will probably not be returning to this location. Bad service, gross building, and okay food."}
{"text":"BEST bartender in the Carolinas ! TODD at the bar... LOVE him.. My long lost boo took me here on our first date .... We sat at the bar and had Todd whip up one of my fav drinks that I frequent out west... a Snakebite... He made those for me all nite.. and asked if I was sure that I really liked them.. IT was enuf to make us come back EVERY nite to pregame when I am in Charlotte with my boyfriend...Live music on the weekends.. get there early enuf to get that bar stool and talk to Todd.. No joke.. He will take care of you in the end.. :-)"}
{"text":"I have previously had a number of bad wing experiences.  They have been under cooked, many times near raw, and just tossed is bottled hot sauce.  Yuck!  So I was more than a bit hesitant when our two grandchildren and wife opted to have dinner at the Wild Wing.

The menu will knock your socks off, so make sure you are wearing socks as I don't know the potential consequences rising from their menu.  Many, many options ranging from wraps, sandwiches, kabobs, ribs, steak, hamburgers, pizza and...drum roll...WINGS.

Not only wings, but an entire page of sauces with an easy to read color scale of heat intensities.  And which sauces would be good on ribs.  Many were very clever and intriguing.  The choices were difficult with the sauces, but then to determine what to order further burdened, although pleasantly, the diner.

I opted for the ribs and wing combo, choosing a sauce for each item.  Wife had chicken strips with a hot sauce.  Grandchildren, stuck to corn dog bites with smiley-faced fries (really!)  and pizza with mac-cheese, so their lives remained stable, full of unhealthy high calorie food and unchanged.

I quaffed a local draft lager, chosen from a beer menu with at least a dozen drafts and many more bottled brews, along with lots of wine and custom cocktail offerings.

My wings were simply great.  Fried crispy they were perfect...no sogginess at all and the sauce, that I only remember in my mouth,  was yummy.  The ribs were also excellent rivaling ribs served at rib houses.  The unnamed sauce complimented the ribs making a good combo.  The fries were wedges and were also fried perfectly.

Must get the name of their deep fat fryer, type of oil and/or name of the fryer person.

Wife's thick, large hunks of chicken were quite a meal.  Those three pieces were at least double the standard chicken fingers.  Her hot sauce lit her fire, but she did not break out in any sweat.  She simply lost all feeling of her lips and had to pause occasionally to catch her breath and eat pieces of my celery with ranch, made in-house, to cool her pie hole.

The kids consumed great quantities of ketchup as part of their gourmet meals and had no complaints.

In fact, none of us had any complaints at all."}
{"text":"Customer service is garbage! We sat at the bar and the 3 \"kids\" working behind the bar didn't acknowledge us. They were joking around with each other. So we took it upon ourselves to reach over the bar and grab a menu! Finally one of them noticed us and acted like we were bothering her on her job! We watched as several other people sat down at the bar and received the same type of service!"}
{"text":"I have been in here a few times now, and have not had a bad experience yet. This is a typical WWC, same decor as all of the other locations. The wings are very good, and they have a better beer selection than the WWC in Ayrsley. 

Not much else to say, very typical for a chain wing place; lots of TV's, sports bar feel, and lots of \"interesting\" decor on the walls. 

All in all not bad. Definitely worth checking out if you happen to be in the Epicentre."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE ON YOUR LUNCH  BREAK. It takes way too long. We got there at 12:15 and didn't get our food until 12:50pm. Seems a little long to me. I ordered a wrap with fries. When I finally got my food, the wrap sauce was wrong.. and the fries weren't on the plate. The waitress told me she would bring that out separately. I didn't get the fries until I was already finished with the wrap. Definitely will not come back."}
{"text":"Decent place to grab a beer. The food, including their highly advertised wings, are good, not great. But it's well worth the money. Staff is wonderful. Great place to grab a beer or catch some live music."}
{"text":"Review edited from July 2017 visit to September 2017 visit.... I changed my mind and decided to come back and try them again after I heard there was a new GM. We went during lunch on a Friday to check out the wing buffet but ordered 12 wings each instead due to limited flavors/variety at the bar.  Tried a few different sauces and found the sauce and meat quality and wing size to be quite decent for the price. I love how the WWC boneless wings (aka nuggets) are very lightly breaded and loaded with sauce. 

I however must admit that I prefer the UNCC area's WWC lunch AYCE wing special - not a bar, more like a tray of 12 wings (2 sauces), then they bring you 6 more of your choice cooked to order until you say stop. Although usually I only get the first 12 (since it comes with a drink, soup/salad and fries), if this location had that option I would have given it 5 stars. 

Our waiter Will was fantastic and recommended a sauce to try as well as got me hooked on a new flavor.  Decent prices, good quality and a very accommodating hospital staff a huge improvement compared to my first visit.  

Keep it up team, and I'll definitely make a few return trips here since it's closer to home!"}
{"text":"$4 Margaritas and Tuesday night trivia! Can't go wrong there!"}
{"text":"Specifically chose to go at an odd time knowing it just opened a month ago.  Walked in to lots of open tables and were told 15-20 minute wait. Ended up being a 45 minute wait. Wanted to keep it simple and order wings and cheese fries. When the wings were brought to the table, they were cold. Really good flavor,  but cold. Think they precook a bunch and just toss them in sauce when ordered.  Went 10 minutes without any drink while eating hot wings. The entire place was struggling. Not impressed.  Don't think they will make it for very long."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that my rating is only applicable to this location only.  I have been to Wild Wings all over the southeast and they are fantastic.  That being said, this one was terrible.  We ordered the hot shots, big fat fries covered in cheese and wings.  The hot shots were ok, the fries looked like someone sneezed some cheese on them, and the wings were luke warm.  I almost sent them back but I didn't has anyone ever seen the movie \"Waiting\" yeah....I don't send food back.  I went home and within 24 hours was experiencing...gastrointestinal disturbances.  Needless to say, I will not be going back to this location.  The only reason they didn't get one star is that the service was timely and the wait staff were pleasant."}
{"text":"We went first night as we are from out of town asked to watch the quail hollow golf tourney that was literally 2 miles down the road they looked at us like we had three heads. Then proceeded to put it on the big screen we thought great, but they seated us in the furthest away table from the big screen it was not viewable from our seat so the server who was awesome put it on a smaller tv by our table. This Tv had a line running down the middle of it. The manager was on the ball and promplty moved us to a table in front of the big screen. We ordered the chef salad and had a good experience even though they were out of ying ling beer on tap. So we went back the second night had a good experience however the food was mediocre but the service was good and the manager remembered us from the night before. They did bring out our appetizers then two seconds later they brought our entree's. So for the third night we went back the service was terrible we had a new server who didn't know the menu at all and had absolutely no people skills. I ordered a turkey burger with coleslaw and my spouse ordered the chef. The server comes out and stated they were out of shrimp for the salad so we asked if we could substitute chicken for the shrimp. Then the manager came out stated that they 86'ed the salad because they were out of shrimp and to pick something else so my spouse ordered the chicken feathers with veggie skewers. Then one minute later they brought out my sandwich I had asked for no mayo and no tomato. The burger was dry and overcooked (or sat under heat lamp to long) the lettuce was shriveled and there was no cheese or onion as the menu stated. I sent it back as the manager came again asking what is it that I want on my sandwich I said I want what is stated on the menu with no tomato and no mayo please. So 10 minutes later they bring me a second sandwich and this one was correct. However 45 minutes have passed and my spouse received nothing while I have received two sandwiches. Finally the server comes back drops off the chicken feathers after I have already eaten doesn't even put it in front of my spouse and states want another beer? Really can't even put it in front of the person who ordered It? By that time my spouse had enough and just wanted to leave without eating. Did I also mention again no golf tourney on the tv we asked if they put it on the person trying to put it on did something wrong and had to reboot the tv so we asked if they could put it on in our booth again tv was not working it was breaking up while tv at next table had it on and it was fine. Very sad that they put this server out on the floor she clearly did no t know the menu and both the server and the manager had to look at the menu to see what the turkey burger came with. 

The male manager and first two servers we had were excellent."}
{"text":"Wings were super crispy - got half hot and half wild west/ranch flavor - and the sauces were perfect. Excellent service at the bar with two bartenders constantly checking on me."}
{"text":"I dropped in for a Yelp event which normally showcases the host restaurant.

Event was 6 to 8 pm and I did not get out of work till 6pm in Statesville so did not make it till 7:15 and by that time, everything was gone so this review is going to be a brief one since it is only on the facility and service. I wish I could extrapolate on others in chain because the Wild Wind down in Steele Creek but I can not make that assumption that one in the chain equals all.

Nice Sports Bar atmosphere although bit noisey Service in general was good.

Otherwise, noe descript

Physical tacitly was good abeait a bit noisy

Overall observation: Nice location and remodel is good.,  Can not evaluate food quality since this was not a normal flow and nvere did get a chance to try the local offerings and that is the mail reason I came. I enjoy some of their locations but don't know now this one stacks up.

Bottom line is try at your own risk.  Can not evaluate food since I never inexpert that.  Service was average for an event but does not reflect a normal dining experience.

Comes down to I can not evaluate the food sense  ever had a chance to try any.. Can not evaluate the service since we were special event and attention was diverted elsewhere.

While this was a special event and thing are normally different, suggest you wait till a couple more reviews come in to show that everything  ahs improved. 

Otherwise, can not recommet"}
{"text":"A group of us went to a this location today to watch the Panthers game.  We first tried to order a Margarita. .they were out of all flavors...ordered wings and frys..frys came out 20 minutes before wings....asked for a knife they were out. ...ordered brownie was told they were out if ice cream."}
{"text":"Ok this is gonna be long.....
If I could give this place ZERO stars I would.
We are sitting outside in the outdoor seating area. Let's address the seating area out here first shall we?
We walk out sit down and we see two tables with groups of people smoking ALL THE THINGS. Hookahs. Now normally this isn't a problem. BUT! There's some sort of affiliation with these people and the waiters/waitresses. Friends/co workers off the job?. Whatever. They obviously know each other. Well. So well that the waitresses stop and associates every time they pass by! And they aren't the only things that are being passed around. No sir. Other things are being passed around. Drugs. Yes you read right. Drugs. I saw on not one occasion but TWO! That's right two occasions where there was transference of money and drugs by the waitress and someone sitting at the table. He first thing me was cigarettes. The second time, white substance in tiny clear baggie all hush hush. Not only are drugs being passed around but they are cursing like sailors! So loud. This is NOT good for business people. Not only that happened but our waitress gave us cold wings and charged us for something we ordered but never even got!!! I'm so very disappointed in this establishment."}
{"text":"Well we came to Wild Wings Cafe' because it was May 5 and everywhere else was packed. Well my food was good I had the Veggie Dilla. And my husband had wings and he enjoyed it. There is DJ here tonight. The tables feels dirty.  This might be little BUT they bought my margarita out in a regular cup( like what they put soda in) . There was a few small TV that I could barely see. Waitress was nice. We had no silverware, I had to asked the hostess."}
{"text":"So first of all Wild Wing Cafe is hands down my favorite wing spot. I've frequented this location many times and have always had great food and service. I've moved further away from this area and I'm not able to get here often so when I found myself hungry and on this side of town I jumped at the opportunity.

FYI parking is usually a challenge here since the parking lot is small and shared with other businesses in the strip and I think they're pretty strict about towing for parking in marked spaces.

Anyway, we were greeted upon entry which was expected but the girl who took us to our booth made little eye contact, walked off with menus without indicated that we should follow her and just wasn't very personable. 

We were seated in the bar area and literally sat there for over 20 minutes with no service. We were busy talking and looking at the menu so we didn't notice how long it had been. I kept trying to make eye contact with the barely busy bar staff to no avail. Finally in frustration I threw my hands up and at the same time a server from the other side of the restaurant came over to help. He apologized for the wait and informed us that it wasn't his section but he took our orders anyway. After he left our real server showed up. We told him we'd been helped already and he said \"ok\" and walked off! 

I rated a 3 because our food was good and hot and though service was slow, our adopted server tried to be attentive. I probably should've complained to a manager but honestly I was just ready to leave. Like I said, usually it's cool here but it's been awhile. Hopefully tonight was just a fluke."}
{"text":"So first let me say that I love Wild Wing Cafe. We came here around 9:30 pm and the restaurant was not full AT ALL. The hostess immediately informed that there was a 20 minute wait. We started to leave but then asked if we could order at the bar. We stood at the bar and were literally never acknowledged. The folks at the bar were already complaining that they had never received refills and that the service was horrible. We literally had to flag down 1 of 2 waitresses at the bar who took our order but never made eye contact. We ordered the Wing Sampler with three flavors and Wild Fries. When she was inputting our order into the system she yelled across the bar to confirm our order. Very impersonal. I don't know if they were short staffed or what but that is no excuse for poor customer service.

We waited almost an hour for 1 order of winds ONLY because we 1. Already paid for them and 2. Were genuinely curious at how long it would take. 

They appeared to be more focused on pouring drinks than anything else. I saw the most diligence from the busboys.

At least the wings and fries were hot (we had been sitting there so long we decided to eat there.) but we only had 1 ranch and 1 blue cheese, no napkins or silverware, and no sour cream that's supposed to come with the fries. People were leaving and going to other much busier restaurants and eating before us. Apparently this is a regular issue at this location. Save yourself some time, hunger pangs, and frustration and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Service is horrible at this location, saw other waitresses more than we saw ours.  Not to mention the AC is off so it is miserable.   I've currently been waiting for my check for 20 mins with no site of the waitress.....  Wonder how much longer they will keep us waiting."}
{"text":"The worst Wild Wings experience I've ever had!  They were out of the wine I ordered and the vegetable skewers, random!!!! In a big city on a Saturday night, no restaurant should run out of basic items! When we did get our food it was awful, they did the right thing and comp'd our meal but was still an overall buzz kill!!!"}
{"text":"AVOID!! I'm only giving a star because I have to. I have been here several times and it gets worse every time. Tonight we ordered garlic, Thai, ginger and bbq. The only one that had any flavor was the bbq. They were all small and over cooked. On the up side our server was fast, efficient and pleasant."}
{"text":"There are a few positives: the wings are (usually) good, there is a pretty good variety of beer at reasonable prices, and there is live music on Fridays.

Beyond the above-mentioned things, I can't find any more positives.  I used to go to here regularly but due to poor service and inconsistent food quality, I have become a more and more infrequent customer.  With several other newer sports bars in this area, I would expect Wild Wing would step up their operation. They haven't."}
{"text":"I had the turkey burger and it was okay. I was turned off by the brown lettuce on sandwich. The waitstaff is rude and it took forever for our food to come out. Also the parking is terrible! I had to drive around for about 10 minutes just to find a park."}
{"text":"Waited 20min for drinks and when we fimally got our water it was nasty, we've been here for an hour and a half waiting on our food and we only ordered wings."}
{"text":"Wild wings, my corner hideout deliciously laden with more wing and sauce flavors than my palate has had the opportunity to enjoy, primarily as I tend to order favorites, unless with new friends and feeling adventurous. Until trying this location, I was not much of the \"traditional sports bar\" participant, BUT, due the level of smiling friendly service and lip smacking wings to entertain me while football is on, they have become a go to spot on Thursday note and other primetime football periods. I'm thinking of having a placard placed on a spot so I can become the Norman, of this one.(Cheers reference)"}
{"text":"PHEW! & Holy Cow!...this is one of the worst opening weeks of a restaurant that I've ever experienced.  It's amazing how service breaks down when there isn't a strong leadership team to keep the morale & standards up.  Despite everything that did go wrong, we were one of the fortunate tables that got seated & received our correct food; food was great.  Server was working hard and completely understanding. I recommend you either wait a few more weeks or simply cross your fingers.

It is now September; this is my follow-up visit since opening week.  The only improvements were that wait time was greatly reduced & managers weren't giving out apologies like Pez dispensers.  The staff has no sense of urgency to perform any work related tasks; texting on their personal phones seemed more important.  Wings were either over cooked or arrived cold; they are no competition for the leading wing restaurant."}
{"text":"Consumer: be aware! Met two people for lunch, all three of us had something different to eat, we all ended up with \"food born Illness\". After my experience I've heard from other co-workers they've had similar experiences."}
{"text":"After some disappointing supposedly Jamaican jerk dry rub wings at the bowling alley below, I needed to right my wing fix so we checked this place out. 

Place was pretty empty on a Tuesday night so that was to our benefit since we had a group of 15 all ordering wings separately.  It took a little bit for our wings to come out and not all orders came out right but the majority were pleased.  Our waitress was very accommodating and quick to resolve any issues, too. Without having to ask, she also got us all individual checks.

My wings were tasty and I was able to get all flats which I prefer.  Wings come in options of 6 pieces with one flavor, 12 pieces with 2 flavors and so on.  You can also get a combo of half bone-in wings and half boneless.

The music was good too... with Lauryn Hill and old school playing.  It sounded like they were streaming music as there were some ads in between.

Overall, Wild Wings Cafe hit the spot!"}
{"text":"This is terrible. We waited 40 minutes to be sat. Then 40 minutes for the appetizer. No sign of wings yet. There are open tables all over and I think I've seen three servers for the entire restaurant. What had happened to this place??"}
{"text":"The only reason it didn't get a 1 star is because I enjoyed the waiters and the drinks here are pretty good. Other than that nothing special. I ordered the onion rings as an appetizer only to get 6 huge rings with tons of batter and oil. The batter wasn't that great either as it was coated with some spices and a good amount of Monosodium Glutamate (MSG).

I then ordered the Philly Cheese Burger. It's sort of a mix between a Philly Cheese Steak and a Hamburger. The burger itself wasn't bad. The let down in the burger was it was pretty expensive for a burger (which wasn't even that big.) I think I should have just stuck with the wings, but that's it. I don't think I will come here to eat again, but to drink with friends I will be back (even though the prices are a little expensive for day to day hang out.)"}
{"text":"5 stars for awesomeness of the food and vibe - minus one star for parking!  David's Chicken and Friends is the BEST!  Always get as my main meal."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: I'm a vegetarian, and I know that a chicken place can't be expected to cater to my lifestyle. That said, the food is not very good, outside of the chicken. My friends LOVE the chicken!

The service is also pretty slow, and the bar regulars can be super obnoxious. It's also pretty loud in there. All in all, I won't go if I can help it, and waiting to pickup food for my friends if I don't think to order ahead of time is grating. I won't eat in if I can avoid it. Don't order the flatbread--it's gross and sad.

Going in for bingo night is alright, but not worth it for me."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Had a party of 10 for lunch, which I know can be difficult, but there were only 3 tables seated.  For a Tuesday lunch.  We got a variety of items, not just wings.  Only two of the sides were wrong.

I had a salad to start.  Some of the lettuce was wilted, and the cucumber was almost rotten.  The wings were much better - 6 Slayer, and 6 Red, Hot & Bleu - but they were not very hot, temperature-wise.  A couple were downright cool.  The tater tots were completely unseasoned, though they were fresh from the fryer.

I'll go back to Wild Wing Cafe, just not this location.  The other I have been to a few times (south Charlotte) is far better."}
{"text":"I never got a chance to eat here because:
1. Hostess was rude
2. There was 5 2 person groups in front of us and they refused to seat anyone at the 4 toppers because they had a rule that only 3 or more could sit at the tables(hostess quote).

On a Tuesday night where there are 6 options within a stroll, seems odd I would have to wait 25 mins to eat a wing. Get a clue management. Salsas right down the way, friendly and fast #forgetthewait"}
{"text":"Came here for 2nd half of the super bowl. A wild wing with an edge compared to others. A Live DJ and TVS every where. Our server was DJ. Want to thank him and wild wing for a great second half. DJ never missed a beat. Wild Wing in Ayrsley section of town. Go eagles"}
{"text":"I will never ever eat there again. My daughter and I went in for lunch on Saturday. THERE WAS VERY FEW CUSTOMERS. Took forever to get our horrible meal,. The waiter obviously didn't want to be there. I wished I would've taken a pic of our plates, just plain horrible."}
{"text":"Decent guacamole but terrible wings. They have a good selection of sauces, but the wings are not crunchy at all. Meet is tough."}
{"text":"Can't give this place a 1, because the food is great, but the service at the bar was atrocious. The bartender was too preoccupied with a few people at the opposite end of the bar, so the end I was on suffered. Had to seek out my own utensils, salt and pepper, etc.
Get a table and enjoy some wings, just don't sit at the bar."}
{"text":"FRAUD ALERT!!! My card was charged a $10 tip I NEVER authorized here. Service was absolutely terrible but I still left a cash tip, she server wrote in a tip after I wrote \"CASH\" on the line and signed the restaurant copy. DO NOT GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Second time I've come here, this time with coworkers. 

The atmosphere is the usual sports bar/rustic hooters vibe. Nothing special, except for a big stage in the middle of the place. Apparently they host bands on weekends. . . 

Service was ok - we had a large group so it wasn't very fast, but the refills were done well and there wasn't a crazy lag between when we ordered and when the food came. In retrospect, that should have been a tip - no way you can make high-quality product for 20 people in 10 minutes unless the fryolator is in overdrive! 

Regarding the food - very average. The signature items (wings) are ok, but I've had much better at places like Buffalo Wild Wing, Hooters and Even the ol' Cheeze Moz' pizza place (I miss their coal-fired wings!). The buffalo sauces are very mild, even if you get the very hot ones. . .It's a personal pet peeve, but if it says 'hot' it should be HOT, not less mild. Some friends had the pulled pork sandwich and declared it mediocre at best. I had a salad too (trying to stay healthy) and it was about as vanilla as you can get. 

Overall, the only advantage of this place is location (EpiCentre). Even then there are better options around - 5 guys for Burgers, Jason's Deli for salad, Blackfinn for wings, etc."}
{"text":"do not spend ur money in this place! THEY  don't care! burnt wings!  Management does not care , go to Buffalo wild wings instead!
How is this place still in business\"   serving underaged drinkkers..!!!!  Women puking in the bathroom stalls! REALLY??"}
{"text":"Only eat here if nothing else is open. The tables were sticky, the menu was sticky, the door to exit was sticky (do you sense a theme?) We ordered a few different kinds of chicken chunks (at least they don't call them boneless wings) and a fajita wrap. The wings were only warm, the wrap was cooked okay but way over on the veggie to meat ratio (very little meat.) The only saving grace were the potato wedge fries. The service was poor at best. We had a waiter who was on his first day, which is fine, but help the guy out. We asked him three different questions and each time he had to go ask a manager. The first question was which version of fries were the best... I rarely score a one star, but his place unfortunately earned it."}
{"text":"I attended Wild Wing Cafe on a thursday evening and did not have to wait for a table.   I was with two other people and we chose to eat in the non-smoking section.  Unfortunately, there really isn't a difference between the non and smoking areas because we were accosted with cigarette smoke throughout our meal.  If smoke REALLY offends you, I would recommend you ask the host/hostess to seat you in the far corner of the non-smoking section.

I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and the chicken was extremely HOT.  Now, I enjoy spicy buffalo wings but the chicken in the wrap caused me to choke a bit from the intense heat.  The fries were good and the prices are very reasonable.

I don't plan on going back because heavy cigarette smoke and game-watching are not my idea of good night out."}
{"text":"I think this will be a 4 soon. They are still working out a little on the cooking. 

The place looks great. A very friendly attractive staff. The service was attentive and the food was served fast. 

The wings were seasoned correctly but slightly soggy. The same with the fries. I have seen some reviews that said the wings were undercooked, but ours were fine in that regard. They were just not as crispy as we expected. At a high level it is an above average chain restaurant. We would come back if in the area."}
{"text":"Appetizer: a small dish or drink taken BEFORE a meal 
We have been so very disappointed the past couple of times at Wild Wings specifically with the timing of the appetizer. Tonight, we specifically requested we get our appetizers before our meal. Yet again, our appetizer and meal came out AT THE SAME TIME. This is so frustrating. Tonight we ordered 2 appetizers and drinks and told our waitress to put the appetizers in then come back and we will order the rest of our food thinking that would help with the timing. It didn't. When we expressed frustration, our waitress just said sorry and continued on with her duties. We LOVE Wild Wings but this is extremely frustrating. Also, the service has not been on par lately. It has been slow. Tonight, our table was not completely clean and there was an empty beer bottle that stayed on the table even after they cleaned it before we sat down. Not the best experience tonight. The food was very tasty but it's hard to enjoy 2 appetizers and 30 wings all at once."}
{"text":"This is the worst place I have ever been in my life. It took over a  hour to get food. I ordered lemon pepper nuggets and it was pure hot sauce and vinegar. I sent them back and asked for plain nuggets and got wings. After almost 2 hours I still had no food. To top it off she wanted me to pay for them before I got them. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THE PLACE AND WILL NEVER RECOMMEND ANY ONE TO GO. THEY DID NOT EVEN OFFER ANY THING BUT WE WILL RECOOK YOUR order. Who has 3 hours at lunch time to wait on wings that are not right.  I will not give this place any stars. It the worst place I have ever been and the worst service in Charlotte"}
{"text":"So after a terrible experience across the way @ Whiskey River....We came here, this place was awesome. The band was really good, the wings where cooked perfectly and Raven was our server, she was awesome! Friendly greeting at the door, my drink was never left empty and we are all smiles! Thank you for fixing my Charlotte experience! (Live in LA) I recommend Wild wings for a good time!"}
{"text":"2nd and last time I will ever eat at this restaurant. Maybe 5 tables being occupied in the entire place and half the tables had left over food on them and were not cleared.  They sat us down at a table that had chicken all over the seat so we sat ourselves the table next to it.  They were out of coleslaw.. of course.  Getting ready to leave and they tried to sit another family in the same seats with the same chicken grease and pieces all over the seats. Waitresses were to busy eating in the area they fill the drinks up it to worry about they're customers. I will certainly never go or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This was about my third trip to Wild Wing Cafe. I had been before for lunch and often their all-you-can-eat-wings-and-tater-tots-bar. It was, at best, meh. 

Today I decided I would forgo the sticky-hands experience of wings and order some boneless wings. Or as they call them here, \"nuggets\". They had a sampler platter... choose 5 wings or nuggets of 5 flavors  - 25 wings for around $20. I wanted to try several flavors so I went with that. 

I would bother to remember the flavors I tried, but it hardly matters:
 
In a word - Sucked. 
In two words - They sucked. 

In case I'm not being clear - All 25 of these boneless chicken nuggets sucked big-time. 

The flavors ranged from salty to oh-my-God-but-that-is-salty. . 

But, not one to turn away food in front of me, or send something back, I did eat about half of them, but that stopped once I ran out of ranch dressing and blue cheese to liberally coat these disturbingly scrotum-like \"nuggets\"."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is even better.  I'm in town for a business weekend trip and the staff is amazing.  Coming from Los Angeles, not used to being served with such delight. Definitely be back"}
{"text":"Lorddddd......Sat here for 10 mins AT THE BAR, thennnnn waited another 10-15 for her to take our order, and it wasn't even busy at all, before even being spoken to! Kind of disappointed because WW is one of my fave restaurants back home in Charleston. Hopefully they will improve their customer service immediately. Food was okay, but also took forever to come out. All we got was a quesadilla and Buffalo shrimp. Smh.  I'm used to much better service in SC!!!"}
{"text":"Every single time I go here, I regret it. I don't understand how you have a 45 minute wait and there are a dozen empty tables. They never staff up for big nights like concerts so half the restaurant is closed. The bar isn't any better. Sat at the bar with a friend tonight and took bartenders 15 minutes to acknowledge us. She threw two menus down and left again. Took 10 minutes before she tried to take our order. I also got a cocktail which was only half full in the glass (??) and when I ordered another cocktail ( three times cause she kept forgetting), I never got it. I've never had good service here, so no more of that."}
{"text":"In the midst of the DNC, after the Daily Show taping, we easily found a space to grab a bite here.  Five of us all agreed some wings would do just fine for our late-night appetite, and I've always found Wild Wing Cafe's wings to be consistently delicious.  The service was quick and friendly and yes, the sampler platter with Medium, Red Hot & Bleu, Jalapeno Cheddar, Red Dragon and, my new favorite, Island Jerk were, again, all delicious.  The loaded skins we shared beforehand were amazing!  Perfectly crispy on the outside, and light fluffy on the inside.  My mouth is watering all over again!"}
{"text":"I will never eat at hooters or Buffalo Wild Wings again. The only negative thing I have to say is the traditional wings are a bit small I wish they were bigger but other then that the wings are always cooked perfectly And they have a huge selection of sauces to choose from . Great place to have drinks and go in on some all you can eat wings"}
{"text":"I like this place. But as a sports bar, not having the SEC network is a little ridiculous. You're on the border of South Carolina and cannot even show the game? That's unacceptable. It's not that expensive to have as a business. Just saying... heading to Buffalo Wild Wings for my game"}
{"text":"While waiting for our food, the family beside us left and wished us luck. They waited 40 min for their food and as everyone's food arrived, someone in their party was told what they ordered couldn't be made. We waited 50 min for our food and we had to request silverware once our food arrived. I ordered grilled chicken and received fried. I ate it anyway. Who has another hour to wait? Our server said the manager would come to speak with us but we never saw him. As we left the parking lot we saw 6 staff members standing out back smoking, one of those being the manager that never came to speak with us. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came in late at night after just flying in. Tasty food made with good ingredients (had the fiesta fajita wrap) with a decent enough beer selection. Worth a try.

Bartender was a little slower to get to me but she was serving a full bar by herself."}
{"text":"My lunch buffet experience was good. The food on the bar was consistently warm and fresh. My waitress was pleasant and polite. My only criticism is I would enjoy a few more flavors of wings on the bar. Considering the price I can't be upset with the selection."}
{"text":"Wild wings never disappoint. From the friendly staff to the amazing food. The local drink selection are amazing. The bartender staff is friendly and will always chat if they have time. And if you aren't sure what you want to drink tell them what you like and they will make something great for your liking."}
{"text":"Came back again for Tuesday's buy 12 wings and get 12 wings free. They never disappoint. Tried the slayer wings and some sort of spicy Asian. Both were great. I love the taste of the slayer but I wish it was a little hotter. Service was great. She kept the beers coming. Had a coupon for a free appetizer so we tried out an order of their new nachos on chips. Great meal and I will continue to come back on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre, service is terrible. I have only been here twice and both times were friends suggestions. I don't care much for their food, and the service is really bad, our waitress was busy sitting down at a table having a personal conversation with a man she knew rather than serving our table. I had to stand up and walk to her table to request my check."}
{"text":"I prefer BW3 for this same kind of experience, but this place is ok. This branch is brand new, as William S indicated, so it's clean and the staff has that squeaky, newly trained feel that's kind of nice the first few times you go to a place. 

The beer is cold, the fries are salty and crispy, and the games are on. It's what you'd expect from this kind of sports bar/chicken wing shilling establishment. It's not my scene exactly, but they do what they do well."}
{"text":"Servers are all trash. I've been coming here for years and I left town for the last 4 years.  It's totally different. They are not professional and welcoming. My wings weren't cooked right and they were small and shriveled up with sauce thrown on them. My server got an attitude because we asked her for extra utensils, then while waiting I look over and sure enough she's standing there talking and laughing with another server. Finally after 5 minutes she looks over at me and I guessed she realized she never got us our utensils so she went to the kitchen and out walks another server bringing us what we asked for. Nothing said, just dropped it down on our table and walked away. You guys need better management because these servers obviously feel comfortable doing these things."}
{"text":"It used to be good. But recently the quality plummeted badly. I don't wanna eat here again! Tasteless wings. Bad servers. Nothing is good about this place now!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the lemon pepper wings. The sauce is good I wish it had more lemon flavor to the wings. The sweet potato fries tasted processed, I will not order those again."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the wings and chilli cheese fries! I always go for the Ranchilada and Red, Hot, and Bleu sauces. They're a good combination of spicy and flavorful."}
{"text":"I have been to the WW in Asheville I Guess more than 30 times always great food service and drinks. BUT... there is something about The WW At this location and one other it seems like it must be KFC.
     IT all started about 230pm I guess I had passed by this location a few times but, decided to stop. They had a all u can eat wing and soup I think (I am trying to forget). FIRST THE SERVER DID NOT HAVE A CLUE. So I get to the buffet line 4 dried out wings and no soup. I stopped 2 employees and asked about the food they looked at me like I was from MARS...I and I guess 4 people waited for wings nothing came out. I LEFT 3 dollars on the table for the tea and was out of there. I CALLED THE PLACE a few moments later and spoke with a bartender who sounded like he was on crack that said he was 'in charge right now\"HE kept repeating over and over what I was saying so there must have been some sort of medication... issue so I hung up.
          I called their Corp office and spoke with \"David\" who said he was a district manager he said the bartender should not have been in charge and laughed about it   ????After he tried to sweep it under the rug he invited me to another location and told me it would be better and after about 3 weeks sent me a letter with a gift card..
         So after about a month I was stuck in traffic pulled off and decided to give then one more chance... NOT goin to go into the terrible service while there you can message me if anyone wants details.. Anyway got wings to go got home opened the bag and a ROACH CRAWLED OUT DAMM. !!!!!! I called the CORP GUY and he said there is no bugs in that store...I ASKED HIM THEN WHAT JUST CRAWLED OUT A CHICKEN WING? Again he invited me to the location on Ardslye his FLAGSHIP LOCATION NOT ANY BETTER I GAVE UP ON WILD WINGS IN THIS AREA"}

I stopped 2 employees and asked about the food they looked at me like I was from MARS...I and I guess 4 people waited for wings nothing came out. I LEFT 3 dollars on the table for the tea and was out of there. I CALLED THE PLACE a few moments later and spoke with a bartender who sounded like he was on crack that said he was 'in charge right now\"HE kept repeating over and over what I was saying so there must have been some sort of medication... issue so I hung up.
           I called their Corp office and spoke with \"David\" who said he was a district manager he said the bartender should not have been in charge and laughed about it   ????After he tried to sweep it under the rug he invited me to another location and told me it would be better and after about 3 weeks sent me a letter with a gift card..
          So after about a month I was stuck in traffic pulled off and decided to give then one more chance... NOT goin to go into the terrible service while there you can message me if anyone wants details.. Anyway got wings to go got home opened the bag and a ROACH CRAWLED OUT DAMM. !!!!!! I called the CORP GUY and he said there is no bugs in that store...I ASKED HIM THEN WHAT JUST CRAWLED OUT A CHICKEN WING? Again he invited me to the location on Ardslye his FLAGSHIP LOCATION NOT ANY BETTER I GAVE UP ON WILD WINGS IN THIS AREA

{"text":"We dropped in here tonight for a quick dinner, so decided to sit at the bar. Mistake. There was one bartender working and 12 or so people sitting at the bar. It took us 5 minutes to be acknowledged, and another couple of minutes to get a drink. The bartender appeared to be hungover, high, or just didn't give a shit about his job. I honestly have never met anyone so apathetic about his job. I would have given him a break if he looked stressed or slammed - but he didn't. It took 25 minutes for us to get our wings- 5 minutes after the guy next to us got his wings (and he sat down 5 minutes after we did). Apparently our food was brought to the wrong table. That wasn't acknowledged until I asked where are food was. When we finally got our food, it was lukewarm. Not exactly how you want wings and fries. Never once did manager offer to help him, nor ask customers how everything was. 
Having worked in the restaurant industry for several years, i was shocked he was a bartender. Usually that position was reserved for the higher caliber employees. It was something every sever strived for. This guy seemed better suited to be a bus boy. 

A woman sat down next to us and I told her she would have better luck being in a waiter section. 
Very disappointing experience made worse because of lackluster service. Won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The spot was pretty busy. Being seated was no wait; however I waited a while to be serviced. I didn't mind because I was in no rush. This was a night they had $3 bud lights. I got a loaded potato chips appetizer, which was pretty good. Definitely a good spot to watch the games, grab a beer, and hang out. Just don't be in a rush."}
{"text":"Love the all you can eat lunch wing deal.  Favorite wings are the garlic garlic garlic and Boss.  Ranchildas hit the spot also."}
{"text":"Wings unusually small tonight and they did not provide wet wipes. Drinks were nice and strong however."}
{"text":"2 out of 5 starts because of terrible service. Management needs to get a better handle on the restaurant, and their employees.  The food was decent, otherwise I would've rated 1 star."}
{"text":"Probably the worst one of them all. I work nearby and have had lunch there at least 10 times. The prices are decent but the food quality is hit or miss. The service is normally good, but the reason for my low score is due to the slowness and wait times to get your food. On a few occasions, I've had to get my food to go, after waiting over 40-50 minutes for my food. Also take in mind, this place isn't that busy around 12-1pm for lunch. You'd think it would be, but it's not. 

This week, I had another terrible experience. I went to the bar to place a to go order, it went normal. The bartender was nice and attentive, but leave it up to the kitchen to mess things up, as usual. 45 minutes went by and nothing. The bartender went to check on my food and came back and told me they gave my food to someone else. She asked if I wanted to wait for another one, but at that point my lunch break was almost over. Who knew how long I'd have to wait. So, I told her no. She asked if I wanted a coupon and was actually trying to right the wrong, but I declined and told her I wouldn't be back to use it. 

When I call my food in, it isn't that big of an issue as I know I can just leave work later to make up for the slowness. But on a few occasions I'd get back to my office and the food just didn't taste right. Which is why I prefer to order the food in person. It's safe to say at this point that I won't be back ever. I never see the same staff there so that tells me the turnover is pretty high, it's no wonder they can't get any consistency."}
{"text":"The wings are much better at DD Peckers or Moosehead.  The wings here are just boring!  Boring Boring Boring!  The sandwiches are 'eh'.  Luckily they get good bands that come through and the service is actually pretty good otherwise who would come here?  It is a great place to watch any game, tons of tvs and good beer specials!  But I judge a lot on food...sorry WW Cafe!  Lucky for you you are in a good location because there are MUCH better options!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. Service was beyond slow, took over 30 min for our food to get there when the place was pretty much empty. All of the food was over spiced. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but when we picked up a sampler today, the wings were so burnt, you couldn't tell the difference between the flavors, which is super disappointing."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative star I would.  We went in with a group of four last night before a concert. We waited for an hour and a half and never got seated even though when we left there were 23 tables open. This place has serious management issues."}
{"text":"Went while on a business trip. Loved the wings, service was second to none. TVs galore even at the booth. It was a bit loud so if you are looking for a quiet place, look elsewhere but this is a wing place so enjoy the unique flavors available."}
{"text":"Loud and dingy. If you're a wing place you should a least have good wings. Service was great and that is all."}
{"text":"Great spot!! It's been a favorite of mine since 2010. I guess living across the street from them for 3 years didn't help lol. But they've got a solid menu. Over 20 flavors of wings(my go to meal). And daily food & drink specials. My wife actually just hosted my surprise bday there last night. She knows me too well. Food, sports, and booze under 1 roof?? What more do you want??"}
{"text":"In Charlotte area for business - a few coworkers and I decided to visit for lunch time. Wings were ok really, I've had waaaay much tastier wings at many other places including BWW. 

Sauces weren't bad / again just normal quality. 

5 stars for service
5 stars for parking 
3 stars for food taste and quality 
5 stars for options on menu"}
{"text":"I was a little worried from some reviews prior. Tonight during the Big East tournament the server was attentive, read back our order and continually refreshed my drink without any issues. The order came in less than 30 minutes and was almost perfect except for the carrots with the wings were not fresh (I know that isn't exactly what everyone else looks for) otherwise we would have had a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Go with a group and split a couple of wing samplers. Their hottest wings are called the \"Bravehearts\". They'll definitely make your lips tingle, but I've had spicier food. It's a great place to meet for a drink, with the buzz of Ayrsley all around.  It's nothing worth driving across town for, and frankly there are plenty of more interesting restaurants nearby. But if you're looking for a beer and some bar food, this place will fit the bill."}
{"text":"I arrived here with couple of friends to watch our first Panthers game for 2010/2011 session. We enter the vicinity and there was no one at the front counter for us to be seated so we waited and finally decided to pick our spot. 

We were lucky enough to get two servers since one was under training. She was trying to figure out what to do, where to get stuff but she was sweet, fast enough to bring out what we needed which is perfect. 

They have huge projector right in the middle and LCD TVs all around so you can't miss a game even if you try hard enough to avoid one unless you go there during off game time. 

This place is getting only three star because of the fact that our food sucked big time on multiple orders. My friend ordered medium spice wings and they made it so spicy, they couldn't eat it more than four piece. I ordered veggie stuff which came out soggy and finally we ordered chocolate molten cake, which was cold and hard. 

Chili's at university has the best chocolate molten cake in town."}
{"text":"My friend flew in from Philly and arrived here late around 11p. Now he wanted to have some wings so I thought Wild Wings would be a perfect place to go. 

We arrive at the EpiCentre location and we waited seven minutes before anyone came for us to be seated. They were not busy at all. Anyways, so we were seated and no one came to ask us for drinks for another fifteen minutes. 

Finally, a server came to ask us for drink and she told us that they ran out of food. All they have is fries. So we just got up since my friends wanted wings. 

The reason I gave them three stars, because server was nice enough to recommend us couple of place in the EpiCentre so we don't have to go far."}
{"text":"Stopped in here late Saturday night for some drinks with the crew.  They quickly accomodated 15 of us around 10:30pm at night.  They were busy, but not too crowded and there was a live band playing on the stage mostly 90's stuff, but occasional current covers.  There's nothing unique about this place because it's a chain and it's a sports bar, but we really had a great night there.  

Our waitress said she was really busy and a little overwhelmed, but I thought she did fine!  She was quick and very attentive.  I had a Coors Light and ordered the wings \"hot.\"  All drinks and food orders seemed to come out quickly and there was quite a variety between chicken tenders, nachos, LITs, shots, and the sort.  All were quite happy with their choices and the service was great too."}
{"text":"Came in late to get take out after working out.  Waitresses walked by me while serving others. Not even a \"hello have you been served\". I sat at a table near the bar for 3min.  Came in with the wrong color on my skin.  Finally traveled to the bar to get service. Never recommending this place to anyone..."}
{"text":"I am a huge wings fan.  Living in Charlotte, almost everyone who sells wings claim they have the best.  I have been to some places with pretty good wings but my favorite is still at Wild Wing.  They crisp the skin the way they should be done and they are the only one's that I have found that have sauces hot enough for me to my liking and also a couple that are too hot for me to eat many without needing some milk.  I like their lunch buffet when you can get as much as you want for about $12.  They have plenty of TVs with sports so that is a big plus for me."}
{"text":"One of the worst wild wings I have ever been to. I used to brag about this place when I was little but this new one sucks. First we sat down right after walking in and waited 15 just for a coke. After that we had to wait 20 minutes for us to even get a server. Then they burnt our food and didn't tell us that's why it was taking so long. So we waited another 45 minutes for our food. The wings they brought out where wrong and never brought me the right thing out that they said they were making for me. So we talked to a manager and they only offered us 20% off and our order wasn't even right. Horrible customer service and horrible management. The managers acted like it was our fault."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a late lunch. Nice bar. Everything is new. The bartender was adequate. It's a new place and have a few kinks in the hose here and there. I think they will get better. 
I would recommend it but don't expect a 5 star experience. It is just chicken."}
{"text":"There is a fine line between a live band adding to the atmosphere and being flat out annoying. Went to the Arsley location the music was way too load. We approached the manager and he basically blew us off. Two miles away is a Buffalo Wild Wing same or better food and our ears will not ring when we leave."}
{"text":"I give up on wild wing cafe. How the hell do you run out of butter on NFL playoff weekend?!?!? You have a grocery store right across the street go buy some damn butter. We come in with a party of 5 starving and we don't get told that there isn't any butter until we start to order after our drinks even made it to the table. Being out of butter made it to where our entire table's order was ruined. This is the 2nd wild wing cafe i'v been to in the past 2 weeks that i've had an issue at, looks like I need to start going to Buffalo Wild Wings like I am right now. How about maybe next time you have a sign at your front door saying you are out of half your flavors or have the hostess let everyone know so they don't have to wait 15minutes for a table."}
{"text":"Hot mess express!!! Our food came out twice cold! When they remade our chicken feathers they literally reheated the 3 I didn't touch and sent them back out let's not notice I didn't eat the 4th cold one, it just sat on my plate. The sad part is they weren't busy and now maybe I know why."}
{"text":"We love this place. We used to live within walking distance so we would go here almost every weekend and never had a bad experience. The food did sometimes take long, but that was usually when the place was packed. Plus, the wait was worth it because the food is delicious! We tried so many of the different flavors of wings and there wasn't one that we didn't like. Their dips are awesome. We love getting the Triple Dipper with hot spinach dip, chile con queso, and the best of all ... buffalo chicken dip. Soo good! The waiters and waitresses are always nice, friendly, and attentive. Their wraps and sandwiches are good too, though we usually stuck with the wings just because we are such fans. Anyway, they definitely deserve a 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"Worst dinner experience ever.  Went with 19 people the music was so loud you could not even scream at my family.  Will never go back"}
{"text":"Made 2 stops here while in Charlotte for business.  First stop was pretty good.  Ordered a bunch of things and shared.  Oh and wings are bogo free on Tuesdays! 
Wings -thai and ragin cajun or something-5 stars
drunken shrimp-5-these are a must!  Great bread for dunking! 
mile high ult nachos-5 great amout of toppings for chips.
slider sampler-peeps, litttle b's and bbq pork slidesrs-4
2nd trip was during a big game day-Panther's in playoffs (sorry panthers) so the place was jam packed!!  We expected this.  We started a tab at the bar until a table was ready and had to stand.  okay by us.   Then got a table maybe 1.5 hours later.  Again ordered more stuff to share.
flatbread pizza tomato basil-1-horrible excuse for pizza. Elios is better.
dip sampler-spinch dip which first came out cold when we ordered it hot-3
buffalo chix dip-1 (be ashamed of your self Wild Wings for not knowing how to make a good  buffalo chix dip? Really)
chile con queso-2-sucked but not as awful as the buff chix dip.
Quesadilla-3  
Good thing worked paid for the food however we still aquired 160.00 bar tab!  
Stick with wings and nachos here.   And don't forget the drunken shrimp!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location before and had great service--on their super busy trivia night no less. Sadly this experience fell very short. I was on a business lunch with 4 other people. Thankfully, I hadn't recommended this place. I'm a former server. I understand people have off days,especially when things are busy, but I could only count 2 other tables in the whole restaurant--including the patio table. 
Salads (for the wing lunch special) were served, and we had to ask for silverware. Not a big deal. 
I ordered a turkey burger. It took about average time for our food to come out so no complaints there. When my turkey burger came back a regular burger, I had to wait 10 minutes before I could even ask her it was a turkey burger vs a regular burger (they look and taste different)--and one is temped to preference, the other is not. I ended up taking my burger to go. One person's side came out incorrectly. We practically had to tell our server everything we wanted (beers, etc including extra orders of wings for the people that had ordered the all you can you eat wing lunch special.) in the 10 seconds when she visited our table before she darted away from the table like we had the plague. When we asked for the check, we had to ask another server there if she could run the card for us because we were just sitting around trying to get back to the office. If I was paying, I would have asked to speak to the manager, but I think this review is sufficient. I'm not sure what her priority was, but it didn't seem like she even tried to pretend that it was us. 

If something is off--understaffed, etc, please let your table know. I would have been more understanding."}
{"text":"Given this place's reputation, I was expecting quality wings and sauces. I ordered 12 boneless wings, half braveheart half habanero hots, and they were of astonishingly low quality. Basic red pepper flakes, no hint of any habanero, extra salty and vinegary like tobasco, and they were served ice cold. All 6 people in our group were disgusted by our orders. 

The only saving grace of this place was their buffalo chicken dip, which had a cream cheese base and had a great tang to it. This is a cool place to hang out, but a terrible place for a hot wing connoisseur."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service, extreme lack of management. Over an hour, did not even get all our food had to split food so everyone could eat. Asked for manager and one never came"}
{"text":"Small crowd on a Monday but that didn't help with very poor, cold food. Ordered fried mushrooms and 10 wings.  Mushrooms were cold and greasy with the tempura batter soggy.  Wings were colder than the shrooms.  Spoke with the manager who was unconcerned.  Walk across the street...better wings, atmosphere and service"}
{"text":"I worked for WWC in charlotte for a while and LOVE their food. I was extremely happy they opened a WWC in Gastonia where we bought our new home. We have tried this place 4 different times now and it seems to get worse with every visit. Hostess (if present) is always rude and makes us feel like we are burdens for coming to eat at the restaurant. Food is always under/over cooked. The food has taken over an hour to come out twice, which I know the cook/prep timing for the dishes so when the manager tried to lie to me it wasn't very impressive. The waitresses there are either not involved enough, show no professionalism (I'm married and one waitress made a sexual comment about myself and the guy friend I was there with. Totally baffled.), and seem to not care about their clientele. I don't write bad reviews unless I sincerely feel they deserve it. We have even complained to the manager about an entire plate of Wings we didn't eat because it came out after an hour COLD and with the wrong sauce and the \"best they could do\" is comp half the order. Please, save yourself trouble and do not eat here. I have been making the 30-40 minute long trip to the Charlotte location if I crave WWC. So worth it. This staff needs corporate rehabilitation, they give WWC such a bad name."}
{"text":"Okay short and sweet. Food was good, once it finally showed up. Emily tried to take good care of us, but the rest of this place did there best to work against her. Some of the slowest , worst service ever."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with coworkers and was very underwhelming the wing flavors didn't match up they didn't come out piping hot and the dark atmosphere was a cheer up for me either. So needless to say I'm not rushing to come back!"}
{"text":"Don't go to this place either hungry or thirsty. My wife and I try to give a place at least three chances, everyone can have an off night. However, this place has blown on all three occasions and all with the same problem. The service is awful. The wings are flavorful but the size of them are so small you'd have to eat large amounts just to be sated. But, the worst part is the sheer ignorance of the management and the bar tending staff. Order their not so special specialty drinks and you'll be blessed with a blah tasting overly sweet sorority girl concoction, but order anything else and just watch as the blank dum stare washes over their faces. I do give them one star because you can get a cold beer, sit at the bar and watch sports on TV. They also offer a all you can eat wing buffet for lunch, but at $12 that isn't cheap."}
{"text":"I'm no stranger to other Wild Wings Cafes and I'm a fan. This particular ones service was a little on the slow side. The slow service annoyed me more than usual because there was very few other customers in the restaurant. My wife and I only ordered some wings, no appetizers or anything, and it took 40 minutes. 
 All was forgiven when the food did come out. Very fresh, flavorful, and piping hot! Everything I expect from Wild Wings Cafe. The waitress was apologetic for the wait which I appreciated. I can't say if this is normal for this location or if something was going on just that day. I would go there again."}
{"text":"This is a fun spot in the epicenter to watch a game and eat good food. There's a bunch of TVs all over! They've even gone out of their way to seat us where our game is playing.They have a lot of different flavors for wings. I really enjoy their homemade ranch and blue cheese.
 Service has always been great, even in large groups. 
I can't say anything bad about this spot. We stop here every time we're in town to kill some time before we fly out."}
{"text":"My favorite wing joint with about 34 different sauces to choose from. Fried shrooms and ranch dressing are great too. Live entertainment so it's pretty noisey."}
{"text":"Used to eat at the location at Ayrsley about once a week for  along until they started going downhill. When location opened locally, was very hopeful that the quality was back. It was as far as the service. Our server Was Brianna and she was extremely attentive. We ordered chips and salsa, chips were stale and the salsa was waaay to chunky, the taste of the salsa wasn't bad, just the enormous size of the cuts were off putting. Wings were over cooked. Not the worse wings I've ever eaten, just not what I was hoping for."}
{"text":"I guess some of you guys went on some bad days or something. I just left from there and it was great. Service was friendly and timely with everything. Food was great. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best wings and service. Waitress was not annoying, food was fast. Wings are crispy and baked with one of many flavor choices. The meat inside is juicy. I could not have asked for a better dining experience aside from the obnoxious meatheads screaming and yelling at TV screens."}
{"text":"Food was horrible! Service was slow. I came during lunch on a Tuesday. Only 2 waitresses working. The All You Can eat bar was never replenished. They had bugs flying everywhere because of their bay doors being open."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. This was my first time at Wild Wings and I think it will be my last. A friend suggested it as a place to eat before a movie we were going to see. We went around 5:15pm on a Friday it was dead inside. Should have been hint number 1. Then we get seated and our waiter seemed very new and possibly just got off training. He was nice enough though. Took our drink orders which took forever to get. Then as he was writing down what we wanted my friend noticed he wrote wings instead of boneless nuggets. She corrected him on my order and we watched him cross it out and write in the correct order. So shocked and surprised was I when my order comes out as wings. UGHHH. I let the waitress no that I actually ordered nuggets and that is when it became even worse. It took 20 minutes for new nuggets to come out. 20 MINUTES! And they were the smallest pieces of chicken I have ever seen and I ordered the mini order of just 6!!!!!!! I didn't say anything at the time but when the waiter came back and asked me how they were I said ok, but it took soooooo long to get them out after the mistake that was made by YOUR TEAM and he just chuckled lightly and said yeah. No apology and nothing. The minute he brought them out too he just sat them in front of me with no apology for the wait or anything and zoomed over to talk to his friend. Poor Customer services guys. I will make sure to tell my friends to steer clear."}
{"text":"Solid BWW-like place in uptown. Fair prices for the location, great selection of sauces, and pretty great service for how busy it was. Probably won't blow your mind but will satisfy your wing craving. I am an out-of-towner just here for the game btw so take my word as an outsider"}
{"text":"I am rather shocked that a place that prides themselves on wings cannot provide a better product.  If you are in there for the buffet and you enjoy a variety of wings, this is your place.  If you want a high quality wing in great buffalo sauce with a variety of heats and fresh made Blue chesse, stay away.  
What you will get is an over cooked, tiny wing that has very little meat on it.  Some people like that apparently."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food. No problems with customer service. Price ranges are good, not to expensive, not to cheap."}
{"text":"Stopped in at the Ayrsly Town Wild Wing Cafe, at the recommendation of the hotel bartender, and prettaaaay prettaaaay prettaaaay pleased.

Cheap beer and trivia on Tuesdays, and a buy 12 get 12 deal.  We had the Flamin' Parmesan and the hot, and the Flamin Parm was mmmm mmmm. 

They were good meaty wings, and the beer kept flowing.  To top off the night, the winning trivia team name was, \"my couch pulls out, but I don't\""}
{"text":"We recently stopped into Wild Wing Cafe with some friends as we were told they had the best wings in Charlotte. We tried the Ginger Wings which were very delicious! We were a bit disappointed as they were out of some craft beers and being that it was very slow the service wasn't that great but we loved the food and atmosphere and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Came here to watch a Panther's game on Football Sunday and, not only did they have the game on almost every TV, has the sound playing through the restaurant and they also had a DJ there playing tunes during the commercials and doing giveaways. It was a home midday game, so the place wasn't crowded at all. We found a high top right near the bar with no problem and started with some beers on special. I had a Sam Adams Octoberfest for $4.

For food we ordered the app trio with potato skins, spinach dip, and mozzarella sticks all of which were very good. I particularly liked the spinach dip and it comes with tri-colored chips. My fiance also ordered wings and claimed they were very good.

Most impressive here was the service. We were checked on regularly first of all, but then when we went to pay and use a coupon, the register wouldn't let the register ring both that discount and the beer discount ($1 off the Sam Adams from $5), so the manager came over and spoke with us directly and we told her \"no big deal, it's just a dollar, we'd rather save the $5 from the coupon\" or something similar. She was super nice about it and also wound up giving us 4 more coupons. Very pleased with my experience here.

Only gave it 4 stars because it's bar food and nothing quite out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I went here for a yelp event.  It was really fun.  This is a newly remodeled space, so it had a great ambiance.  The food was good and the beverages were even better.  Check out their outdoor space!  It looks like a cool place to hang out and watch people.  Definitely, catch a panthers game here too!   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good wings, lots of choices on flavor. I had the lemon pepper and the ranchilada, both were tasty.

Service has improved here greatly in the last month or so. The bartenders are extremely attentive and friendly and go out of their way to make guests are taken care.

The menu is huge, so I would suggest checking WWC out several times to get a grasp on everything they have to offer.

If you're looking for a great place to catch the game on Sunday, this would be it."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere ,  Great Wings what more do you need.  I am a frqent flyer at buffalo wild wings and my personal opinion is that Wild Wing Cafe beats them by a long shot!  I went on a Tuesday night with a few girlfriends,  it happened to be half off night and also bingo night.  So much fun! Wild Wing Cafe is located on a street full of \"best in town wing spots\" and from the few I've tried this is the best place yet!   Definitely will be returning again!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout wings from here while I was in town for work. The wings were really good, there were expansive flavor choices,  and it's pretty cheap. I can't comment much on the atmosphere but suffice it to say the short time I was inside, I couldn't tell if it was more like a TGI Fridays or a wannabe club. It was confusing at best, albeit entertaining."}
{"text":"Love  the food... Hate the customer service.. call in order come in 10 mins after it was gonna be ready... had to go to bar this is where shit went left I walk up and the bartender and someone was talking not about anything big just talking but didn't feel the need to see why I had be just standing looking at them... they finally say something and then walk away from me no problem going to get my food right.. nope the bartender walks off to have another conversation so I wait 20 minutes for a all in order I was 10 minutes later picking up smh I wish I was in Charlotte they get you in and out plus it was cold so I know it had been ready ?"}
{"text":"#1 Terrible service 
#2 Told hostest we would be at bar for the wait. Never came to get us skipped over us
#3 took 35 mins to get food order
Ordered 3 appetizers  1 came...
#4 got wrong food order and also didn't get drink order correct.

Been to many wild wings  recommend others not this one"}

{"text":"If there was a \"0\" star this place would get it, we wanted to watch the football games - which may be the only thing this place is good for - it took 40 minutes to get our wing order,l they dropped off the wings - no plates or napkins and no explanation of which wings were which. before ordering our meal we asked how long it would take for burgers and salads and the waiter went to the kitchen and they said 15-20 minutes - another 40 minutes later the food came out. The Mojitos were warm. The meal came out and the Gouda burger came out without the fired opinion straws. Our first clue should have been that the place Wasnt crowded at 5pm on Football Sunday... The manager did take off 35% off the bill - it's not worth the time - and the food was mediocre at best . Now  at checkout they put the wrong amount on our credit cards so we now have to wait even longer. Took another 10 minutes for them to figure out the bill."}
{"text":"Worst service ever... I was sitting at the bar, it's busy and my bartender was dealing with another customer so I said \"excuse me\" to the male bartender because he was infront of me making a drink.. He ignored me .. He left and came back and was making another drink which I said \"excuse me\" again and he responded \"WHAT!?\". I've served before and never in my life have I ever came across a server/bartender that responded \"what\" to a customer..."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. I hate when serves don't write orders down. Our server was so confused on what wings we order, she messed up the flavors. On top of that we ordered nachos, she asked if we want them first, I said all at the same time would be fine. Wings came out first....after about 20 minutes it was apparent she didn't order then. When it came to pay the bill, she dropped off the tab, didn't say a word and walked away. Then proceeded to take another eternity to come back (which she didn't), my friend had to bring the bill to her. One of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. I know it's a corporate but come on, train your staff to be professional at the very least. Never again wild wings never again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go here because we were waiting for our movie to start.  When we walked in there were 5 people standing at the hostess station.  After we were seated it took about 15 min for our waitress to come by to take our order.  We decided to share the Slider Sampler and an order for wings.  The wing flavors were very over powering.  We had to ask for plates, twice.  Also we had to ask for refills.  When we were ready for our check, it took a bit to find our waitress.  She was all around the restaurant.  She was nice, but not very attentive.  I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"I like Wild Wing Cafes in general. They have a great beer selection and always have great music. The food is pretty good as well.

The only downfall to this location is parking. If you are going on the weekend, plan to have a very difficult time finding parking.  People who plan these complexs need to tak inter consideration the occupany of all the business that are going to be there!"}
{"text":"I have been to a ton of Wild Wing Cafes all over the south and they are all similar.  Good food and great live music. They have some good drink specials and an okay selection of beers on draft.  

If they are extremely busy, the service will suck but that usuallyhow it goes anywhere."}
{"text":"I liked this better than Buffalo Wild Wings. I had the grilled chicken feather with Spicey Asian marinade. It was simply really good food . Great spot for lunch. Too bad the parking is limited."}
{"text":"This place sucks! Slow and Poor Service. The food was mediocre and the drinks were watered down. How does it take over 30 minutes for salad? The world may never know...sighhhh. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Looks like every other wild wing nothing special. Decent staff they are nice and keep track of you. Beer menu needs some work they only have one local. Menu is the same as other locations. Great for wings and they usually get you right in. Parking really sucks though it's right and not a lot of them."}
{"text":"I had stopped going to the epicenter location due to horrible service. But I was craving their fried mushrooms so I said what the hell. So I get seated and spend the next fifteen minutes waiting for service. No luck so I left. I would of complained to someone but that would of meant someone there actually acknowledging that I was there.This is by far the worst customer service in the epicenter. I hope they go out of business."}
{"text":"This place use to be ok. But it seems some of the new hostesses are rude and not sure what customer service is. Now when I do go I try to deal with 1-2 waiters that I know. Otherwise I wouldn't get any help.
Not to mention a couple of times a friend and I have been there was told there was a wait with tables open. And we sit outside! Once finally outside there more than 4 tables open."}
{"text":"We arrived in Charlotte after driving from Raleigh and were desperate to watch the Yankees win the world series.  Our hotel was near the airport so they recommended Wild Wing as a decent sports bar.  So off we went on a 20 minutes drive to eat and watch the game.
   Yes, it is a sports bar.  Yes, it has multiple monitors.  That satisfied our baseball viewing requirement.  How was the ambiance?  It was a sports bar. It was COLD.  It was fairly loud, but didn't feel intimate in the least.  The high ceilings and decor probably doesn't help in that area.
   The food?   Just okay.  Wings were so-so.  Onion rings were kind of gross (actually it was the puddle of grease under them in the plastic bowl they came in).  We got a heaping pile of BBQ chicken nachos that was kind of disgusting too.  I got a bowl of the white chicken chili that was decent.
   You know when you go out to eat and you can't help but devour food that you know is mediocre and really bad for you?  This was the situation.  My colleague and I both agreed we had just eaten some really bad food.  
    I am adding a star because when Hideki Matsui hit a home run, the whole bar broke out in a cheer....so for the fact that there were Yankee fans there, I have to upgrade my review.  
   My advice if you need to go here?  Get a designated driver and then drink so much you won't taste the food.  Make sure your health insurance is paid up...."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in on a Thursday night at around 11 PM to get wings.  Was told upon sitting down at the bar that they were out of chicken wings.  Say what??  Out of checking wings at a place that has wings in the name.  Ordered cheese fries instead.  Took half hour to receive.  Bartender was nice."}
{"text":"Jalapeño Cheddar wings and beers! Can't ask for a better place!

Good staff, awesome service, and greasy view of the TVs."}
{"text":"Sorry WWC, had to downgrade you from 3 stars to 2.  If you go here for lunch, be prepared to wait a super long time for the food/service.   I don't know if it is been because we have gone when the place was short-staffed or not, but it seems to be a continuing trend (has happened 3 times now).  The only really good thing is the lunch wing buffet and you can get your food right away.

Granted we only have 1hr for lunch, but when you spend the 40mins of the hour waiting on food, you end up shoving the food into you so you can't really enjoy it.

Poor server seemed to be cooking the food as well since she would disappear for long stents at a time.  

You are still on my radar WWC, but you are on the short list to be ousted from our lunch options up here in the University area. :("}
{"text":"Like the location.... needs improvement as far as service goes.  This is pretty much your typical Wild Wing Cafe... just located in the Epicenter - bigger... but not necessarily better.  The wings I had were ok, but I was pretty super hungry that day and also we were downing some cheap draft beers while watching Sunday afternoon football.

Was expecting there to be more people and a better atmosphere for football, but it was okay.  Seeing how it wasn't that busy, it was really hard to get our waitress' attention in getting what we wanted ordered.

The TV's were also all positioned everywhere... and we got a weird table so we spent most of our time careening our necks to see certain games.  I like how some sports bars make it easy to see EVERY game."}
{"text":"Well after 2 years, I decided to give WWC another shot and went here for lunch with a few of my colleagues.  

All of us were under the impression they still did the wing buffet.  Apparently they stopped that.  But they do the all you can eat wings and I sort of like the new setup better than the choice of 6 wings that are baking under heat lamps.

The new deal is you get a choice of soup or salad and then a choice of 2 flavors of wings with a total of 12 wings at a time.  So every one at our table ordered a different flavor of wings so we could sample each others.  I ordered the Atomic and Red white and Blue or something like that. I was looking for my own heat and then a cool down.

One of the problems I've had with my previous visits here continues.  The service is sloooooooooooowwwwwwww.   Salads came out 25 minutes after ordering and my dressing was wrong.  I ordered honey cilantro lime and received sesame.  Drinks also took forever to get refilled.  

Also the spice levels are actually a step below what they should be.  You'd think Atomic would be hot but it was actually medium.  The hot were also medium and the medium were mild.  

Add to that the the parking situation is terrible here and it just makes me want to stay away.  But let's focus on the positive -- at least I raised this a star from my previous review!!!"}
{"text":"Great service !! Go see my boy, Ovie, he'll take real good care of you! Sports and yummy wings! What more do you need!!?"}
{"text":"It was a busy night, so they told us about a 30 minute wait. Ok, no problem, we just went over to the bar for some drinks to burn some time. The problem though was the fact that we walked by several open tables that suited our group size. We just wrote it off to maybe being down a server. That was until they sat us forty minutes later at one of those very tables that was open when we walked in.

The bartender was good. He moved quickly and was on top of things. He also worked with our server to transfer our tab to our table. A simple thing that many places will not do so it was appreciated.

Our server at the table was also good. He came by often and was friendly. His visits got a little too space out toward the end, but overall it was good.

There are plenty of televisions to catch the game, or many games for that matter. There is a large bar area and a lot of regular seating as well. They had a live band in later in the evening. I am normally ok with this at a bar, but it confuses me at a sports bar. Especially with so many great 8pm games on. Also for whatever reason it was very warm inside. It was slightly crowded at times, but not enough to justify the excessive heat.

The food was ok. I ordered 8 boneless wings in the flaming Parmesan sauce. The sauce had decent flavor, but was certainly not flaming. The wings were large, but slightly over cooked. Not burnt, but overly crisp.

I also ordered the Steel Town Spuds with tater tots. You get a good sized portion. The tots come topped with ranch dressing, bacon, scallions and melted cheese. The flavor was ok. They brought out some buffalo sauce to dip it in and that made it much better."}
{"text":"Visited this location with friends tonight to see a friend's band. Our friends waited 90 minutes for an order of wings. No joke. 

Bar is not well staffed so good luck getting a drink. 

I can't see a reason to ever return."}
{"text":"I went here to catch Game 6 of the CHA-MIA first round playoff series.  I was not impressed.

Our server greeted us after we'd been sitting there for five solid minutes.  The first thing she asked was \"Do you know what you want?\"  We'd never been to Wild Wing Cafe so no, no we did not.  We ordered a couple of beers and the buffalo chicken dip appetizer while my wife decided what entree to get and I tried to decide which sauces to get with my wings.

We ordered our food.  I got the wing/boneless combo with China Syndrome and The Boss.  My wife got the Philly Hoagie.  About ten minutes later, our server came over with our appetizer.  She put it down and stood there, waiting for us to take a bite.  She said \"I can't just stick my finger in there to make sure it's hot, so I wanted to make sure it's warm enough.\"

What?  Really?  It's chicken dip.  Does she trust the line cooks that little that she doesn't think they can heat the chicken dip up properly, or had it been sitting in the window for so long that she wasn't sure if it was hot any more?

That question was answered when literally one minute later, a food runner came by with our entree dishes.  So we got to eat the chicken dip while our main courses rapidly cooled.  Oh, and the dip wasn't even really hot, but I let that slide.

The good: the boneless wings were large and juicy, and the China Syndrome sauce was pleasingly spicy.  The Boss on the regular wings was excellent, as well.

The bad: the wings are tiiiiiiiiny.  I don't think I've ever had such small wings at any establishment.  Also, I got 5 flats and 1 drumstick.  Per another Yelp review, apparently if you ask for all drumsticks there's no upcharge like at most other places, but I wasn't aware of that and didn't know any better.

My wife's hoagie was sufficient, if over-cheesed (with...American?  Ugh) and the steak fries were okay if a bit mushy.

Service was slow and barely adequate, but there were a bunch of TVs.  We left after the third quarter, if that tells you anything (not due to the fact the Hornets were losing).  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Upon entering, this place takes the initial feel of a sports restaurant, with so much team paraphernalia draped throughout the place. They have a pretty big bar area with a good selection of brews & pretty good tv viewing. While the atmosphere inside invokes a large sports restaurant, the outdoor patio area is relatively small but you'll always be in the shade.

The wings aren't anything spectacular & I'm not sure how they won best wings in Charlotte by Creative Loafing. Nevertheless, they do have tons of sauce choices, but the prices are really unreasonable. If you aren't going there with a large group that all want wings, then expect to pay quite a bit per wing. For me, the wing quality just doesn't equal the price you pay. So the wings are better than average, but you can find plenty of places serving better ones for cheaper.

Other than the wings, the other menu items are actually pretty good too. From slider burgers, to wraps, you can usually find something you're in the mood for, & I really haven't had anything I wasn't happy with. But once again, I just think the prices are a little steep for the quality of food you're getting. 

So overall, I'd say Wild Wings is a nice retreat to watch a game or grab a brew, but make sure you go with a beefy group to order the wings in bulk, or else expect a pricey tab at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Side order of fries overpriced but it's ok,  parking isn't the best but the atmosphere is nice for a wing joint"}
{"text":"Decided to go here after the movie and it wasn't crowded, but the service is super slow...maybe because its Monday...who knows. Any way ordered our food and it took forever, when we got it , it was cold but ok moving on. I got ready to put my burger together and I noticed a clump of beard hair melted with my cheese..ewww I will not be back!!"}
{"text":"Trash! When we came in to be seated we were told there would be a 45 minute wait. It was st.patricks day so it was pretty much busy everywhere so we figured we would just wait. We were told that they were not going to call us to be seated so we needed to keep checking on our table. We checked on our reservation about every ten minutes to assure they would not give our table away. After waiting for 45 minutes I go to check on our table and was told \"the kitchen is closed now\". Why would you have us wait just to waste our time! Completely unprofessional and unapologetic. If I could give less than one star I would."}
{"text":"As I type this, on a full stomach it's now 6:08. We sat down at 5:11, waited, waited some more. The floor manager finally came up and asked if we had been helped. 

Apparently, we had been sat with someone on break. We are assuming it was one of the waitresses who was smoking in the middle of the parking lot we had to wait for two of them to move out of the way so we could park. 

Anyways, the manager gets our drinks for us since we had been waiting for awhile. One of the glasses of water had lettuce in it. By this point, we are laughing, what else can you do.

We get a server pulled by the manager. Our order in for the Queso, 30 wings, tots, and a kids meal. 

Didn't take long for the food to come out. They sent fries not tots. No biggie, but come on now. 

To recap the events: dumb girls in parking lot, long wait, lettuce water (which I took as dirty dishes), wrong food sent out. 

Queso was pretty, but kinda watery, I dont even know how but it was really thin. 

Corn dog kids meal was ok, my kid said they were over cooked...he is 7. 

Our wings were actually really good. We got jalapeno cheddar, atomic, garlic garlic garlic, hot, and loco Bueno. All good, and served hot. 

Fries, and tots were good. 

The gnats and flies were absolutely insane too. I was swatting my entire meal. 

Now our service started out rough... well we had none so it started out non-existent. 
David ended up getting ua put on him. It was my first time having him, but out friends are familiar, and actually raved about him. Now we know why, I would have given this place 1 star if he hadn't turned our experience around. 
He was literally the only one who looked like they were working for the longest time. Bouncing around from table to table while a bunch of girls huddles in groups talking. Except for a thin girl with bright red hair she seemed to be on it. 

We were there for well over an hour. I Wasn't to mad about it, but my suggestions to the owner are as follows: 
First: Make David your trainer & do whatever it is you can to keep him. This is my 3rd time here, & my first time actually semi-happy, or at leaat first time I've left happy. 

Second, pay attention to your staff. Watch them, see who isnt working, and c clean house. They aren't serving any purpose to you. Probably why you have horrible reviews. 
Third, a person who acts like they are in charge (manager guy)should NEVER bring a dirty cup with multiple bits of lettuce floating in it to a customer. Pay attention!! 
Fourth, fly traps. I get you have open doors but maybe some plants, a few sticky tapes hidden in strategic places. 

Fifth, your kitchen staff isn't consistent. See suggestion 2, I shouldnt get good food every third  visit. Thats about 120.00 bucks I've spent, b/c you don't seem to comp shitty meals, and only 43.00 of that I was happy with.

I'm just a lowly Yelp reviewer but, work this shit out. 

Thats all I have."}
{"text":"We will not be returning here. I gave them 3 stars because our server was incredibly friendly and efficient. 

Food is overpriced. My fiancé got 12 boneless wings for $12.00, half of them were incredibly small. He felt like he had eaten 6 wings.

My chicken feathers came on a skewer and were overcooked, taking away from the flavor and making it incredibly difficult to get off the skewer.

Our total bill was way too high for what we got. The only perk was seeing several football games at once."}
{"text":"Service . . . ugh.  People in my party always tip, someone considered not tipping for the first time ever.  We still tipped but that should give you an idea of just how bad it was.

Long story short: spent a lot money on drinks and food and there were multiple order mistakes with our food.  Kitchen was so slow we didn't send any of it back.  Waitress brought wrong change and was surprised we would want our change and she couldn't just keep it.

Health score 82, lowest I have ever seen."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience at this Wild wing. On a Friday night I went out with my friends and I got a call from my boyfriend saying as they were seated the 17 year old hostess  slipped his 25 brother her phone number, they laughed that off and ordered dinner. Then the waitress began to sit down at their table( very inappropriate) and tell them about her personal life, her boyfriend and hinted they were not faithful to each other, no to mention she served them each 6 + beers getting them both drunk. I understand if someone orders it you serve it but really you should know not to over pour two people there by themselves because then how will they get home. I was asked by my boyfriend to come get him when my friend and I arrived it was very loud because they had a live band which was probably the only reason I'm giving the one star. We sat down and according to the boys the waitress was no longer her over friendly self like she was before. Shocking, we stayed about 15 minutes and when I went in the bathroom all three stalls were filled with girls puking their brains out, crying, screaming, and one laying on the floor. I decided to hold it as I crawled over the drunk girl on the floor, proving this was really a class joint. I know a bar cant really stop people from getting drunk but be responsible enough to tell someone no if they reek of vomit and cant stand up straight. I recommend to all the ladies in Steele Creek don't send your husbands or boyfriends to the Wild wing if you don't want them getting hit on by the staff. There is a time and place for flirting but work is not the place, I'm all for getting a good tip but being forward is highly unattractive and makes people not want to come back. Hope management reads this so the can do some house cleaning but I won't know because like I said we will not be back."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is horrible. I came in to make a to go order & the person at the bar was on their phone. They looked at me, saw me waiting, and proceeded to keep texting on their phone. Then they were so busy talking to others that no one gave me my food when it was ready and I had to request someone to hand me the bag."}
{"text":"The service here was more than disappointing. We were sitting down for 15 minutes before a server even came. The food wasn't cooked all the way and the service was weak. I would not recommend this place. If you're looking for a wing place, try Buffalo Wild Wings because the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday to watch the Panthers game. Got there a little late and I didn't think I would have a seat. We sat at the bar for about 5 minutes and then table opened up. I don't think the wait staff knew so I had to go tell them but all in all the table was cleaned and we ordered food. We started with the burger sliders. my boyfriend demolished them before I could take a picture. He said they were good. Then we ordered a platter of 30 wings. They sauce them in increments of 6 not 5 (weird right) anywho. and order my favorite Steel town spuds! Everything was delicious. I also ordered a margarita of course. LOL Food was great, only compliant is the panthers lost but Wild Wings can't help that. LOL  I will be back to this place."}
{"text":"I used to love going to Wild Wing Cafe in college back in Charleston. I have tried the Wild Wing in Ayrsley 3 times and each time I say to myself, never again! After this last time, I had to write a review and vow that I would not give them another chance. The wings were cold and the bathrooms were dirty as usual. The whole place just feels gross. Go somewhere else for wings!"}
{"text":"I have been to all the Wild Wing Cafe locations, and this one is by far the best. Needless to say we ordered the wings. Along with that, we ordered the House Chips... SO, why was it better?
Well, the wings were perfectly done and still hot when they got to the table. The house chips were COMPLETELY cooked and crisp (unlike the other two locations where they seem to be oily and soft). 
Our waitress (Samantha) was great... she checked back with us several times for drinks... and followed up on the quality of the food immediately. 
Overall, a good experience and we will go back."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of WWC to begin with, but unfortunately it is sometimes a go-to for partially edible food product when in the area of the \"Epic Center.\" But, let's be honest it needs some serious help. Understaffed, under-cleaned and under-managed. I would've assumed - you know what they say when you assume - that with an area like this you would strive to be the best as possible with all the competition around plus all the bodies that show up to the e-center. I guess I'm wrong.

It's a huge place, but I've rarely seen a lot of people there. Sometimes it can take awhile to get seated - especially when it's empty. The staff always seems overwhelmed, which takes you back to my point about understaffage.

Several draft beers to pick from, some locals - Charlotte restaurants should be proud to carry local beer. There are so many great choices in the area!

The food is marginal. It's edible, but certainly not over the top in any way.
It definitely needs a pick me up."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I had the ginger wings and it was surprisingly good. When it come to me it looked plain but it was full of flavor. I also had the potato skin with bacon and cheese and when I picked it up the oil literally came dripping out like an open faucet. This place does not really stand out in my opinion. It is unremarkable. No different from any other wing joint but the food is good."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Got the spinach dip and it was mediocre. Wings were good but small compared to local wing places and over priced!"}
{"text":"Food is good. But the service is incredibly slow and I mean.. Really really slow. Step it up!"}
{"text":"Visited after panthers game my husband and I wanted to find a good place to get wings and watch football, we were seated immediately but walked out after reading through the menu a few times and did not receive a single word from the server at the table, not even a \"I'll be right with you.\" Can't review the food as we waited around 10 minutes before escaping after no service from our waiter."}
{"text":"We got there and I had concerns.  Restaurant is dingy, and not maintained well. Bathrooms were not kept up, soap dispenser was dilapidated and almost out, no paper towels and visually dirty. 

So we ordered wings in a total of 5 flavors. This is what they specialize in, and what we were after.  It took forever to get them out to us. I mean like, a long time. 

All I can say is not bad. Not great, I guess good flavor, but combine the atmosphere, cleanliness and wait time, not worth it."}
{"text":"We visited 2 times during a 2 week business trip.  We had a rule of no repeats, but it was so good the 1st time we gave it another go.  The 1st trip was a friend/coworker,  a 3rd party coworker, a friend from the area who joined us later, and me.  We shared drunken shrimp, chipotle jolt and thai wings, sliders, and an order of nachos. The food was great, the wings was spicy and flavorful. The sauce in the drunken shrimp was a beer marinade that you could almost drink straight it was so good.  I had several cherry limeade vodka drinks.  On our 2nd trip, my friend and I returned the day of the Panthers playoff game. We literally spent the entire day/night there, it was so much fun.  Our food was disappointing this time however.  We had a dip sampler and the only good dip was the hot spinach dip.  The waitress brought us the cold one first, but then corrected the order.  The queso was mediocre and the buffalo chicken dip was just gross.  We also ordered a tomato basil flatbread that was terrible.  We had an amazing one at BlackFinn a few days before so we were disappointed by this one which was simply some cheese slapped on a tortilla. However, we relocated from the table to the bar, enjoyed the atmosphere and our many, many drinks, and had a really good time despite the disappointing food that day."}
{"text":"I only come here when friends want a run-of-the-mill wings and beer to watch a big game. The food isn't bad but it isn't great. The wings are fine but a little pricey, and if you've been to Wild Wing Cafe or Buffalo Wild Wings, then you know what to expect.  In my opinion, for good wings at a good price, just go a couple miles down the road to Wing King Cafe, a more \"local\" bar atmosphere.  

However, I was pleasantly surprised by the individual television screens at some of the booths there. 3 of us shared a booth with screen which made it pretty convenient to watch the game and chat at the same time. 

Servers were nice but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"First of all its so loud in there you have to yell for your waitress to hear anything you are saying. Secondly, the waitresses shorts were wayyyyyy too short for me. I didn't order wings for whatever reason. Instead I got a sampler that had mini hot dogs, mini chicken sandwiches, and mini burgers with fries. It was OK but I've had better. The bathroom was not the cleanest and I have serious issues with nasty restrooms in restaurants."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would! Wait took forever and there was so many open tables. Sat at the bar for a while, while we waited. Once we got a table we got the rudest waiter I've ever met in my life, he clearly didn't want to be there which made it awkward for our group of four. Food took an hour to come and still got our food orders wrong. So rude!!!"}
{"text":"No stars. Went on sat around 7pm.Not busy at all. 
Tables needed to be cleaned. Place look sort of dark and dingy.
We sat outside.  After waiting 15 min for someone to come to take
Drink order we got tired of waiting and left.On way back out door two 
Waitress were talking to hostess. They will not have to worry about 
My business.My wife and I drove about 30 min to try this place out..
Very disappointed...don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Floors gross, no one had anything in order, sat and waited for an hour for food in the middle of the afternoon. No compensation for the wait only a oh I'm sorry for your wait. Food was incorrect when we got it and decided to leave at this point. Would never go back here again. I would give a 0 Star if I could."}
{"text":"I don't know if their servers do any work, I had to track them down to put an order in for terrible food...its a joke"}
{"text":"These days there are a lot of different wing styles and recipes and some of them are really really good.  This is not the case at WWC.  They haven't kept up with the times and the wings are disappointing.

The restaurant is somewhat dirty and it has a smell that is also not appetizing.  Sure the beer is cold, but if you have to list that as a highlight, the bar is set way to low.

I'm done coming here."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. It's your typical sports bar, nothing phenomenal about the food or ambiance, but it gets the job done when you want to drink beer, watch football and down some wings. The one positive it has going for it is that they serve VERY oversize salads that are really good. It seems as though it's missing something; I can't really put my finger on it. But it feels as though it could be so much more if just a little more effort and care were put into this place."}
{"text":"This place just opened in Gastonia, NC. The kitchen is still working out timing and cooking issues. I ordered The Boss wings and the Coppers - one dry rub and one wet. The wet were under cooked with pink chicken and the dry rub came out black and over cooked on one side. Most of the runners and waitresses are high school seniors getting their first experience at service, or so we were told by our waitress. Our party of five food came out fast but the party of three table behind us waited almost an hour to get their food. With our fast food delivery quality was not great but the table that waited for a long time quality was on par for this chain restaurant. Again speaks to timing. We were charged extra for a cup of ranch for each of us that should have came with the wings. We asked to speak to the manager to correct our bill and show the quality of food but after a 15 min wait after the request we were told he was tied up in the kitchen. We had spent enough time in the establishment and just paid our bill this time. Unfortunately, we all boxed up most of our food not for fullness but quality. It will feed the pets instead of sending back as kitchen waist. I'm giving 3 stars because with all new openings kinks must be worked out. The selection of draft beers is great and not the usual five or six you regularly see. I've ate at Wild Wings before and it can become a favorite wing spot. The closest one I had before was in South Charlotte, an hour away. This one is at least only 30 min away from my current residence. Let's hope this one gets it together."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Absolutely horrible.
Where to begin....

1.  Room-temperature beer
2.  Apathetic manager who did not want to hear my group's complaints about room-termperature beer
3.  The WORST guacamole I have ever put in my mouth, hands-down
4.  Otherwise mediocre food.  Nothing whatsoever stood out as good.
5.  It's at the Epicentre, which just sucks anyway.

I will never make the mistake of returning to this abortion of a restaurant again."}
{"text":"I loved this place. All I had were 2 types of wings, 22oz of beer, a mini hot dog, and some pretzel bites but that's all I needed to put a huge smile on my face. 

The pretzel bites were soft and buttery and the chicken was bursting with flavor, meaty, and cooked perfectly. The hot dog tasted as you'd expect but with cheese and chili all over the place. 

With all the great restaurants in the area if I had to recommend one to a friend, I'd pick this place. Also, our waiter was very friendly and helpful and the service was stupid quick."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous. 
Got there a little before 8PM and was told it would be about 35 minutes. So I waited and watched as tables were empty and never really cleaned off....or were cleaned off and no one was sat at them. Finally sat down after 8:30....
I went last night on a Tuesday for their wing special...I've been to this location several times on a Tuesday night and was able to order 10 wings and get 10 free, and get different flavors. Disappointed to be told that all wings have to be ONE flavor....pretty boring to only get 20 wings of the same flavor, especially since they've done differently before. 
Still waiting at 9:15....server walked by several times but didn't say anything or apologize for the wait. I have never waited that long at this location, and it was pretty ridiculous to wait this long without anything being said. 
Slow cleaning and seating + long wait for food + no apology or courtesy to let me know it's going to be a while from a server or management = me not ever returning to this location. This isn't the only place in Charlotte to get wings."}
{"text":"Normally love to eat here and have met some awesome people who work here. 

This time I call to place an order for pickup and the lady on the other end sighs when I ask her to place an order. Then reluctantly takes my order. She says it'll be ready in 10 minutes. I arrive 10 minutes later. Pay at the bar with the \"manager in training\" then I proceed to sit there for 40 minutes not being talked to or updated on anything. Finally the MIT says he is gonna check on my order now. Comes out and tells me they are \"waiting on the rice\" it was dead slow and rice doesn't take 40 minutes. Regardless it was poor customer service from the guy who is apparently training for a higher position. 

Also only received about 3 bites worth of the rice I was waiting so patiently on."}
{"text":"I'm reminded why I haven't been here in over two years.  It took forever to get a drink order.  Service was non existent, timings were awful, and employees had bad attitudes.

I wanted a small dinner so I opted for soup and fried mushrooms.  (Yummy yummy mushrooms remind me of a hard-to-find \"down here\" but \"back home\" food.)  I asked to have my soup brought out first, as did my dining companion.  It took a while for the soup to come out and not even a minute later, the rest of the food came out.  I was disappointed with the timing.

When the server came back with my payment, she didn't leave a pen.  I couldn't flag her down for one so I went to the bar to get one and left her a small tip, only because I'm not \"that\" mean.  The pen at the bar didn't work so I tossed it back down and the bartender said in a pi**y tone, \"You didn't have to throw it!\"  (I didn't, but I admit I was frustrated and could have acted better.)

Also, I hate places that let their front of house staff smoke while on break.  Our server smelled of smoke and it made me want to gag."}
{"text":"Service was good for a weekend lunch.  The server kept the drinks full and was attentive to needs.  The food, however, left more to be desired.  It was just average and I'd return for the soup and appetizers.

The tots were cold.  The chicken tenders were uff-duh!  Spicy!!  I mentioned that to the server and she told me to get them in the children's batter instead.  I was disappointed because she didn't offer to replace them and the menu never stated the tenders are in a spicy breading.  The mushrooms are being advertised as being in a spicy batter and the chicken was spicier than those."}
{"text":"The food here is okay, nothing particularly great. It's pretty standard fare for a place like this. I went a couple of weeks ago and honestly cannot remember what I ate (which tells how memorable it was). I do however, remember how incredibly slow the service was at this location. I went on a weekday evening with some friends, and we had to wait 15 minutes for a table when there were several empty tables open. After that, we waited at least another 20 minutes before a server even came to take our drink order (this is the point I generally exit, but given that I was with 5 other people, we stayed). Our drinks took over 10 minutes for water and beers came out much later. The food service was also slow and the waiter was not particularly friendly (he wasn't mean, but there was no apology for the extremely slow service even after we mentioned that we had waited almost an hour before our food order was taken). I am pretty big on good service (or at least an attempt to correct poor service) when I go out to eat, so I probably wouldn't recommend this location. I would have likely given this place 1 star if the food wasn't decent."}
{"text":"On Sunday afternoon, I walked down here. I decided on the Crispy Chicken sandwich, which I requested to be made non-spicy. My meal arrived just as I wanted, piping hot and fresh. My server was very attentive. I'll come back."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings in Charlotte.  The buffet lunch is a bit pricey but very good."}
{"text":"We came in on a Saturday night around 9:30p and we were seated immediately. They had a DJ playing music and it was super loud so we asked to be moved to a booth along the wall, even though it didn't help much at all. I will say that, although the music is super loud, he was playing a good selection of music so it wasn't TOO terrible, just don't expect a quiet, relaxing evening out on a Saturday night. Our waitress was friendly and attentive but I noticed that they were out of a lot of menu items. I attempted to order two different appetizers and was told that they only had two options available for dips as appetizers. Well alright then, smh. I decided to just have an order of homemade chips with a side of ranch and they were really tasty!! I ordered the Thai wings and my husband ordered the fajita fiesta wrap. Both tasted excellent! The fiesta wrap was supposed to come out with southwest ranch and when it finally came out, there were two random grape tomatoes in it, but uh ok. I would give them 4 stars because the restaurant was clean, the service was pretty good, and the prices are reasonable. I took one star away because of the items not being available but overall this was a good experience!"}
{"text":"Worst wait staff in charlotte.
Staff would rather carry on and joke around with staff than serving guests. 

1.) waitress never asked about drinks
2.) disappeared for 20 minutes carrying on and joking around with other employees.
3.) I had to hand my credit card to the waitress and flag her down in order to check out
4.) waitress was still cracking jokes and carrying on with staff for at least 10 minutes after i provided my card for checkout.

On a positive note the food was great."}
{"text":"This is definitely a go-to spot for my husband and I and our friends to watch football in south Charlotte, especially the Panthers games. Tons of TVS and a great, fun crowd. The bartenders are nice and attentive, and they usually have great drink specials. 

I've only eaten the food here a few times, and it wasn't out of this world delicious or extrao. I will say that if you are going to snack on their wings, try them in the honey sriracha sauce.

I recently went to Music BINGO on a Thursday night and it was so much fun! Such a neat concept, and the crowd was competitive to win. I've also been when there is live music, but sometimes it's so loud you can't talk to the person next to you (when in the bar area). 

See you there!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I have been to WWC several times, and they consistently have good food and service for a great price.  It's the place I always think of when I'm in the mood for wings (even moreso now that NC no longer allows indoor smoking). Yes, they are in EpiCentre so you will likely have to wait during prime time hours, but I think the wait is worth it.  

I have never tried the buffet, but I'm not usually a fan of buffets, anyway. I love the fact that you can get your wings with two different sauces. I usually get the eight piece with jalapeno cheddar (my favorite).  And sometimes, I mix it up with The Boss.  Both are dry so your fingers don't get messy - nice!

Service is usually pretty efficient.  We never have to wait for any refills, and food is always delivered in a snap - even during busy times.

I have not been to Buffalo Wild Wings so I have no comparison, but I just prefer the location of WWC instead.  And, with everything so good, why would I want to go anywhere else?"}
{"text":"I've been hitting up Wild Wing in the EpiCentre for a long time now - bout time I wrote a review for it! About a year ago the place closed down for a bit and went through an overhaul and corporate bought the place up. I, for one, have never had a bad experience here either way... before or after corporate had bought it. 

The food is tasty but you need to know what to order. Some items, like the queso and the buffalo dip, are a bit lackluster, nothing great and I'd say save the money and just get something else. I love the little pups here... they are mini hot dogs with chili on them. Simple enough but the chili has a little spice kick (not hot spice but flavorful). And I tend to get the buffalo chicken salad quite often. The salad is huge and will definitely fill you up. The wings give you plenty of options with over 30 flavors - most of the flavors seemed baked on or maybe rubbed on, but if you are expecting hot wings dripping in sauce, you won't get them here. 

The location is great, except for paying for parking but hey, that's Uptown's thing, not Wild Wing... plus the light rail runs right behind it so you can always jump on that. Live music on the weekends which makes for great energy in the bar. And a good drink selection, plenty of taps and always a drink on special. I don't make Wild Wing my usual jaunt but if I'm around Trade St, I have no problems stopping in for a bite or sip."}
{"text":"If you like dive bars this is definitely a spot worth checking out.  The bar area was pretty busy when I went last Monday and the bartender was great.  There were quite a few UNC-Charlotte students here it seemed and they were a lot of fun.  I'd definitely return for a dive bar fix if I'm ever back in the area."}
{"text":"I like Wild Wing Café in general. There's one near my place and I used to go to watch games all the time. Now, I don't really have the time to watch any game. The food here at the Epicentre location was also good. I enjoyed my Drew's Delicious Chicken Sandwich. The fries were really good too.

One thing I'd like to mention is that it was really cold. I know it's a really cold day around 10 degrees but still. And we were seated at the first table by the door. And the door being what it is, kept opening and we were all shaking and shivering. You should do something about that. Not all places are cold inside because it's cold outside. Other than that, it was a nice place for lunch with colleagues on a weekday."}
{"text":"I have been to this location at EpiCentre several other times, but after the service we had a couple of nights ago, I will NEVER go there again. From the beginning, our service was terrible and everyone in our group thought so. We waited a long time just to receive our drinks we ordered, and in fact, some went to the bar to order drinks instead. We had to ask our server for things that we had already ordered but never received. Our server acted uninterested most of the time. In the restroom, other people who didn't know each other were asking if anyone else had really bad service. Apparently this was the opinion of the majority of the customers there. Also, it wasn't crowded, so they were not overly busy. I have never had a problem with the service at the Ayrsley location and will continue to go there. But the next time I am around EpiCentre, I will go to one of the other restaurants in that area instead."}
{"text":"Well it has been nearly two years since I have patronized a Wild Wing Cafe. My sabbatical has not beed because of the food but the SERVICE. The food is always tasty and fresh which should happen at every eatery. I disappointed in my salad because it was tiny and came with the wrong dressing. I was given wing sauce instead of dressing. When I pointed it out politely the server told me I was wrong. 
The service is slooooow. Extremely slow at every Wild Wing Cafe. I have been to several wild Wing Cafes in and outside of Charlotte. The are all slow. The workers always lack energy and enthusiasm. 
The waitress today whom I will not blast by name was slow to serve us, bring water, bring drinks, bring food, napkins, etc. She asked if we wanted another thing when we responded she took her sweet time. She actually served other people before meeting our request which she solicited from us. I cld go on but taking my card with the bill stopping to take someone else's order with my card in your hand is ridiculous. I know what u r thinking: \"the restaurant was crowded\" but NO it was not. There were less than ten tables taken. She only had 2 then the one she took my debit card to. 
Finally the parking lot was tiny. The majority of the parking belonged to other businesses. I will not return again."}
{"text":"Good wing bar for lunch... when they keep it full, and add the little extras like chips or seasoned fries. The best part is when they surprise you with the \"Flavor of the Day\" at the wing bar... yet those only come in bone-out nuggets. The other standard flavors come in either bone-out or bone-in. All-You-Can-Eat for a good price."}
{"text":"Not epicly bad (pun intended), but I rate this the worst place in the Epicenter that serves food and booze.

Food- Nothing special.  That's true for both the wings and the other food.  Just having an array of flavors isn't a big deal as most places have those now.  None of the flavors I tried were particular bold and the pieces not particularly meaty.

Atmosphere- This place has a feel of some friend of a friend's basement you go to a party at.  Not particular homey or fancy.  The times I've gone they've had some good musicians but the music they played seemed better suited for a coffeehouse than a sports bar.  

Service- Can't speak for waiter/waitresses but bar staff is slow.  I try to be somewhat sympathetic here as I know bartending can be a tough job.  But on multiple I've sat at the bar at times where it hasn't been that crowded and I've seen the bartenders moving in slow motion.  One time I asked for a menu but the bartender didn't come back for over 10 minutes.  Usually when people ask for a menu that means they're hungry and want to order something.  When you see how hard some bartenders work at other establishments, particularly on weekends, I think it's fair to call out the WW bartenders as lazy.  

Bottomline- If you're at Epicenter and craving food you might have an okay experience here.  But your best bet- and this is true for the entire Epicenter- is too eat before you come here and stick to drinking and having fun elsewhere.  There are a lot better options around Charlotte than having to be stuck with a middle of the road place like this."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I've ever had at any restaurant. Service was absolutely terrible and the food was sub-par. First, we got nachos and they were basically cheese soup. No silverware or plates and when a waitress finally walked by (wasn't even ours) she said they ran out so we got 3 sets of plasticware... Even though there was 4 of us sitting there. My friend ordered a margarita and it never came. Then after flagging our waitress down I had to ask her if I could order food. All I got was 6 wings and one was just a small piece of fried bone... So really, just 5 wings. Waitress never came back and the girl that was training her brought our checks over. They should hire people who are actually nice and care about the customers who are coming in."}
{"text":"We didn't check the Yelp rating before we came here, so once we sat down and saw it we were a little sketched out. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with tots and my boyfriend ordered the turkey GTL. Our server was a little awkward, as in she would pretty much stand there until we addressed her first. She was attentive enough though, and tried to suggest a way for my burger to be cheaper. As for the food itself, my burger was very good and the customizations I asked for were correct, but the tater tots were just as you could make at home or get at a Sonic. My boyfriend said that his wrap was way too small and the chips were \"still potatoes.\" When we paid in cash, we did not receive the coins with our change. We should've gotten $63.33, but we only got $63 even. Given, losing 33 cents is not a huge deal to us. But if the business were to be doing this on purpose, they could rack up a lot of extra money quick and that very much made us uneasy. We probably won't be returning to another Wild Wings Cafe."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We waited 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged that we were standing there... after many employees walked by us a number of times like they were blind. We stayed and were eventually seated. Our waitress even walked by us many times and never said a word. We heard many people complaining. Never again. They should scrap the entire wait staff and management and just start fresh."}
{"text":"Took over am hour to get a To Go order. On a Wednesday.  Ordered the grande queso .... got everything for it  but the queso. They forgot the fried shrooms, they forgot my house chips, they forgot my  3 extra sauces i ordered.  Very, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Certainly not the best food you will ever eat but for the price and what it is supposed to be, it hits the mark.  Definitely blows the other chain, Buffalo Wild WIng out of the water.  Food is decent, need more side options but overall satisfying.  Lively bar and I believe they have music on the weekends."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to restaurant with friends but the past three times I went it took 30 min for the waitress to ask us for our drinks and another 30min for her to come take our orders. The food took 1 hour and a half to come out. Keep in mind this happens all 3 times we went. The only good thing about this location was the food and drinks when you get them..."}
{"text":"horrible establishment! watched the MANAGER push and drug a customer out of the place--will NEVER come back again."}
{"text":"I can't wait to never return to this place! I feel bad for the waitstaff that works here, because they are great but unfortunately the restaurant is a mess. They are overpriced for starters, I got the 18 baby wings for $18! Then I asked them to validate parking for me. \"Sure just go next store to the movie theater, they will.\" I went over there and they laughed at me and told me to pound dust. So I'll add $15 onto my bill for that! Bottom line, over priced food and spotty service! This is probably the last place I would visit when in the epicenter!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Waitress was MIA and restaurant was empty. Wings were done wrong. Took an hour to get our food. Apps were terrible. And again, restaurant was empty. Should have taken that as a hint. Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable prices. Everything we ordered was good and fresh. Fried mushrooms for a start...whole mushrooms fried just right. Hubby had the ultimate nachos and I ate the chicken quesadilla. Very yummy and cheesy with big chunks of chicken."}
{"text":"5 out of 5 is what I'll give this place. The beer is fresh and so us the food.  The waiters and waitresses are great too. It's also a good place to watch any sports games or have a guys night out."}
{"text":"Second time eating here, both times were positive.  I go here for wings and have had wings at most places in Charlotte.  I would rate these as some of the better overall wings in town.  They are bigger than Hooters and Buffalo Wild Wings product.  The sauce selection is nice. 

I got the medium hot and Pad Thai last time.  Didn't like the Thai, tasted like peanut sauce and not much else.  I was hoping for more of a spicy hot and sour flavor like BWW's Spicy Thai but whatever.  The medium were good but not buttery enough for a buffalo sauce.  Tonight I had the Spicy Parmesan and Lime Sriracha.  The Parm are awesome, very tasty and juicy.  My fav so far.  The Sriracha weren't that great.  The deep fried mushroom appetizer was actually really good, best I've had in awhile.  The batter was on point.  

Service was good, the girl was friendly and attentive however we were at the booth right next to the server station so that may have helped.  Service the first visit was also good, very friendly guy.  I didn't notice any long wait times like other reviews mentioned but we were there at slower times.  The parking here does suck but you can find a few extra spots near the gas station up the hill.  This place is very open inside and can get kinda loud with crying infants and \"loud\" people in larger groups.

My criteria for wing places are:
-Good sized wings, no mini wings
-Fryer prepared, not just grilled or oven baked
-Good sauce selection, flavor, and applicaiton (enough sauce to drip off is nice)
-Not overcooked and too hard
-Offers all drums or flappers if you ask
-Good Blue Cheese dressing and allows all carrots (no celery)
-Decent prices
-Easy atmosphere, decent area of town, friendly staff

I think this place fills all of those points.  I plan to keep coming here unit something changes."}
{"text":"Most amazing food I've had. I literally inhale the buffarella! Loving hot wings, I get the Carolina fireball sauce which is the perfect blend of sweet and spicy and still has the sting you need from a hot wing."}
{"text":"Couldn't be any worse. My wings came out cold, my husband got something he didn't order and my son's tater tots were barely cooked. I ordered a soda, and that didn't even taste good. Here's a hint: if no one wants a to go box and most of their food is left on the plate, you have a problem."}
{"text":"A group of us were searching the Epicentre for dinner and decided on WWC. Doors are locked and place is empty due to technical difficulties. Sign says reopen in 30 minutes.  So we go elsewhere for a drink and return. The bar is now open and the problem is suppose to be fixed soon.  By the time we finish our beers the problem is fixed and the kitchen is open. Apparently the printers in the kitchen were on the fritz and that's a show stopper for them.

We decided to just stay at the bar and it was great.  Our spunky little bartender was a real treat and had some great beer recommendations.  I ordered the Steel City Spuds and some wings.  The spuds were awesome... plenty of melted cheese and bacon on top and a layer of Ranch below. The fries were cooked perfectly.  The wings were also great... I ordered the Atomic Meltdown flavor which is the 4th down from the hottest.  They were not unbearable at all and I could handle hotter.

Great service and great food... I will return!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, horrible food.  Too expensive for bad.  I went twice to make sure it was not a bad day.  Every day seems to be a bad day."}
{"text":"For years my husband and I have frequently visited the wild wing cafe in Knoxville. Visiting  Charlotte as we transition from Houston TX we stumble upon WWC. With much excitement, we go for a late night snack. After being seated we were greeted and asked for our drink order. We ordered 2 waters and let the waitress know we were ready to order. She told us to hold on because she had nothing to write on. She came back with our beverages, took our order and we never saw her again. After 20 minutes, the food came out. We had no silverware. I had ordered a salad so I waited until the waitress came to check on us and I would ask for a fork... Guess what, she never came. I got up and approached the servers at the server stand and come to find out they are braiding hair....BRAIDING HAIR IN THE RESTAURANT. I have never been so disgusted. I will never be back. Terrible service. Unsanitary wait staff. Poor management. Complete failure. Disappointed..."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such low a low star rating but food was good, service was good. My server well bartender since I ate at the bar, Taylor was excellent. Couldn't have asked for better service. Everything I ordered was on point. I will definitely go back anytime I visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"The first time we came here, the host was nowhere to be found so we were never seated. Only after searching around the restaurant for several minutes, we finally found a server hiding in the station. I made the mistake of coming here a second time. We were actually seated this time around, however, the food did not come out on time. We waited well OVER ONE HOUR for a subpar burger and some tiny wings. Will not be coming back. Save yourself time and money and find somewhere else."}
{"text":"After walking all around the stadium to try and find a bar, we decided to head back to the Epicenter. We wanted a couple of drinks before the game since it was so cold and gross outside. 

We found this place by chance and decided to try it out. We it was beyond packed because of the game, which was fine. All the fans were pretty nice, no fights broke out that I could see. We went to the bar and ordered a couple of beers. $3 bucks a piece with a souvenir cup...not bad. We we found some friends who got a table so we all squeezed in together. The prices of the drinks apparently went up if you were sitting a table because I ordered a Dirty Shirley and an appetizer of Fried Mushrooms and my bill was $15..... 

I thought it was a little high overall but the food was good. Drinks were just OK... overall, just a good hangout bar atmosphere. 
Given the day, and the crowds the wait staff was pretty fast and still nice. We didn't have any trouble at all! We even made friends with everyone sitting around us!"}
{"text":"Good and big wings, house made sauces and dressings.  I really do love Wild Wing, but I can't really 5 star a wing joint.  Only bad thing is service is questionable on the weekends."}
{"text":"Ok.. This place....... is junk.  I'm sorry to be so brutal, but there comes a point when you just gotta do something different.  This place has zero uniqueness and creativity.  The food was awful and tasted like frozen dinners.  (I like frozen dinners when I'm staying home and not spending my hard earned dough.)  Wings were baaaaaad.  THIS JUST IN: YOU ARE A WING BAR!!  If your wings are bad, what the heck else are you going to do.  Only shining points were the size of the place and the location.  It is a rather large restaurant right in the Epicentre.  Other than that.. Avoid!! There are 10x cooler places in the Epicentre to go to.. See Mez and McCormicks.  ANYTHING is better that this joint.  Do not Enjoy!

-Ian M."}
{"text":"Wow - hostess said 30-40 min wait. Well, it's been over 40 min & there has been over 8 empty tables for more than 30 minutes. We sat at the bar while waiting - serious service issues. We're still waiting & only 2 of the empty tables are occupied. Stay tuned for our dining experience."}
{"text":"Love the location and usually love wild wing cafe but this one sucks!! Service was absolutely terrible. No host at the hostess stand had to wait forever to be seated then on top of that the waiter acted like he was too good for everyone and totally messed up our order and took zero steps to fix the errors!! Then we ordered margaritas and those tasted like 100% mix with no alcohol so we asked for that to be fixed and he laughed with the bartender then added water to it to fix it! No no no that is not okay. Service is a zero here with no management it's so sad to see a waste of a great location. Won't return and will be going to Buffalo Wild Wings from here on!!!"}
{"text":"I'm at the bar right now and I can honestly say that they have to be the most attentive bartenders I have had since visiting Charlotte. Jasmine and Cori (ladies please forgive me if I misspelled your names.) are AMAZING!!!!! They are running the bar like a well oiled machine!!!! Plus they are GORGEOUS!! Come see them! I promise it will be a great experience!!!! Thank you ladies for turning what started as a horrible day into a fantastic day!"}
{"text":"Wish I had read the reviews first on Yelp!

The location of the this place is great... but unfortunately that's the only thing I can say that is truly GREAT.

Pros:   Location.  Very good beer prices for what's on tap.  $1.50 draft special.   Pretty good deal.   The appetizers were good, but I'd be surprised if a sports bar/pub could mess up nachos and cheese fries.  They were decent.

Cons:   The food itself is lackluster at best.   With a name like \"Wild Wing Café\" you'd think they were wing experts.  This place does NOT do wings well.   They don't compare to Buffalo Wild Wings.   Wings were under-sauced and cooked to a questionable degree of done-ness.  

I was looking forward to the homemade blue cheese, which seemed to have a mix of poppy seed and vinegar in there.   It was truly disappointing, as I found no chunks of blue cheese and it tasted like it was 90% mayo.   Not impressed.

Of the 4 of us at dinner, no one left impressed.   We left a lot of food on the table, which is surprising for the group I had with me.   We usually eat and drink a lot.  

Sweet Tea was so sweet, I could have sworn it was just guzzling sugar.  I can't say I'm well versed in the sweet tea, but I do drink soda on occasion.  I find Regular coke or pepsi to be fine, but this sweet tea tasted like it had been mixed with 10 giant scoops of sugar per glass.  I took two sips and ordered a beer instead.

Service was ok.  It wasn't terrible, but we found our server missing when we needed attention.   Everyone was pretty friendly.


Overall:   There are tons of great food places in Charlotte.  Go to Buffalo Wild Wings to get your wing fix.   I'd avoid Wild Wing Café unless you're desperate."}
{"text":"I actually thought this place was pretty good. The wings reminded me of Native New Yorker wings back home in AZ. 
We ordered the full order of hot wings for $15. Our waitress was sweet and our order came pretty quickly. We ordered half hot and half atomic hot. We couldn't tell the difference, both were good and hot, just like we like. For some reason though my beers seemed to take a while to get to me, which i didn't like. I think she simply kept forgetting about them. The place had a a big bar area with a small stage for music entertainment during the evening weekend hours I'm assuming, since nothing was goin on while we were there. Lots of Tv's which pleased my son and I as we like to watch football while enjoying yummy wings. 
If I'm ever in the epicenter in Charlotte again I wouldn't mind stopping there again."}
{"text":"Fun fact - Epicenter is DEAD when the panthers play at home. Which makes it a perfect place to go. The Lady and I walked in about halfway into the first quarter and were greeted and seated immediately. 

They had good drink specials so we had a few to get us to second quarter, and then we ordered food. I got 12 wings, split into two flavors (one was a spicy garlic and the other was like a hot teryaki). The lady got a trio of appetizers that included Mozz sticks, potato skins, and spinach dip. She had previously come here for a yelp event and knew that those items were safe bets. Food came out promptly and piping hot. Wings were good!! I kind of expected them to be dinky, but they're good IMO. The spinach dip and mozz sticks were my favorite out of the Lady's apps, but we kind of picked on these throughout the whole meal.

By the time we asked for the check, I saw that one of the beer specials was incorrectly priced, so I asked it to change. Our waitress returned with a manager and basically explained that something incorrect had happened in the system, and that they can't change it. In exchange though, the manager brought over a BUNCH of coupons to use for next time. I really appreciated both of them taking charge and owning up to mistakes, that definitely made me enjoy my experience here more. 

Overall, this will never be my first choice of places to go, but I had to share the positive experience here, especially since Wild Wing usually gets dismissed as a chain and just totally forgotten about."}
{"text":"Ok we used to come here a lot, haven't been for awhile , so stopped in to watch the game, we ordered the usual wings and chips, and what came out was NOT what we ordered, so we sent it back. The wings and chips came back out via the GM, the chips were iced cold, wings were subpar. The bartender said \"the kitchen doesn't take pride in what they send out, and the GM delivered your food, so if he doesn't care, why should they\".  WOW.. are you kidding me. Will NEVER set foot in another Wild Wing Cafe, because the other one in this town sucks too..."}
{"text":"Save your self money, time and patience from the incompetent bartenders and (bar) manager that unfortunately work there."}
{"text":"This is probably my worst experience ever at any Wild Wing Cafe is Charlotte. Granted we arrived 30 minutes before the kitchen close. We order 12 wings two flavors, dessert and spinach dip with sweet tea and water. We were unable to receive refills on sweet tea because the waitress stated that since it was close to closing time it wasn't anymore. Our appetizer was prompt and hot however the dessert was not right requested to correct it and never received. When we asked the waitress about it she said she didnt think we wanted it. After about 30 more mintues of waiting for our wings we noticing that the waitress ran out the door after another employee we asked for the manger. He was no where to be fpund. The waitress and stated that the employee who was the cook  had just quit and our wings was still coming. The manger shows up with no explanation or emphathy about the situation. When we finally get our wings that they brought in a to go box that we didnt request , the waitress states that the next time we need to come earlier and get better service. We all look at each like what the world.. Got the managers attention told him what happen. And this man going to say he sorry she said that and he will talk her about. Said he hope we come again and walked off. Geesh REALLY !  They bring the bill and we was tired ready to go . we paid with no problems when we could have just walked out on our bill because no one was around .. . They did not charge us for the dessert. But it didnt make sense because we never got it in the first place. We was very diappointed in the service and felt very negelected and rushed."}
{"text":"I use to live in Ayrsley about 8 years ago so it's been that long since iv been here. It was just as busy as I remembered from before. As far as drinks I was really impressed with the quality of the drink, the size of the drink and the price. The atmosphere was also pretty good. They do have a security person at the door/roaming around which is always nice to see. The crowd seem to be a mix again which is always nice. Service was all and all good I do have ever wish the food came out a little faster. Over all a good experience and I would return. Parking can be a little tricky just because of where it is makes it very tight."}
{"text":"Terrible hostess experience , was told 15-20 minute wait , was still waiting over an hour later and saw people walk in and sit down ahead of us. Do not go, this place will treat you like a Jew in 1945 Germany."}
{"text":"The chicken club salad is by far the best salad I've ever had anywhere...and at a chain restaurant that's saying something. 

Order the hot shots, these are a spicy sausage fritter. They are excellent. Great flavor, great spice."}
{"text":"Great service, well let say that's where it started off...

food yum once it finally arrived (25 minutes). Poor presentation on the spinach dip.

I decided to do this review throughout the meal, it took us 17 minutes to eat and the server checked on us twice (when she was not needed) as soon as my Husband had a need for a drink refill our server was no longer around."}
{"text":"I'm giving this location 2 stars because the queso was okay. Our server was in the lost and found, didn't bring drinks in a timely manner. When I brought it to her attention she was quite argumentative. I've frequented this location many times before and have never had such treatment. 

I will NOT be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best wings in the area.  I usually prefer buffalo style, but their Jalapeno Cheddar are excellent.  I also prefer drums over flats and they do not charge extra for all drums.  

The variety of wings is staggering.  If you can't find a wing flavor you like here, you probably should not be eating wings.  We have tried many different flavors:

Medium, Hot, Atomic, China SYndrome, Ragin Cajun, Gold Rush and of course... dun dun dun.... Braveheart!  All were very good to excellent.  The Bravehearts are aptly named... they are ONLY for the brave at heart.  I like spicy but these bad boys are the hottest wing I have ever eaten.

My son and I had a challenge to see who could eat more - I won!!  3-2.  I'm so glad he didn't eat another.  4 wasn't in me!

As Bruce K. said, go on Tuesday.  Its busy but the buy 10 get 10 free is an awesome deal.

The place is quite busy on Tuesdays but service keeps up.  Oddly, Saturday's seem to have bad service.  We have been 3 times on a Saturday afternoon where the restaurant has not been crowded any of those times.  ANd, the service has been sub-par every time.  Orders taking too long, orders wrong.  So, we just avoid Saturdays now.

Go for the wings!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately my daughter wanted some chicken tenders so here we are.  We are looking at 40 minute ticket time on our lunch.  We are the only table, one guy at the bar, and no server in sight.  I'm assuming the kitchen staff is on break (I'm being sarcastic).  No apologies from the server, which has yet to learn some manners.  She acts as if we are a burden being here.  I've made eye contact with the bartender which she had completely ignored milking $2 from the loner guy. Sad establishment.  No wonder it's a ghost town. While writing this review, server walks up... slides my plate down....both entrees are wrong. I'm not surprised."}
{"text":"When the name of your establishment has the word \"wing\" in it, you'd expect the wings to be pretty good... The sauces are good, but the wings themselves were sorry excuses for wings. I finished 20 of them with ease! A few days ago I had wings at whiskey warehouse and struggled mightily to finish 20(never did) bc they actually had a decent amount of meat on the wings. Wing wing cafe feels more like an Applebee's or some crappy chain that has lost touch with what got them started."}
{"text":"The other negative reviews are spot on here.  Dirty plates, over cooked burned rubbery chicken nuggets, wait staff ignored concerns about how loud things were walking in.. They seem to think that wailing on a PA system aimed directly at customers  dining @ 109 decibels is acceptable for customers ...beer and dinner shouldn't make you deaf at premium for sub par food delivered with nasty plates, improper coding and billing, blame game from everyone on staff it was mentioned to which make sense .... since when we talked to the manager, who could have cared less about any of it..and the irony of having to yell over the sound systems seated on the other side of the restaurant he still took the well I didn't know about any of this, y'all can get your wings else where attitude topped off with the remark that's how we do things here as a nice dessert cherry topping to the experience...When reading the other negative reviews they always seem to try to get the customer to email them give them a phone number probably so they can give them some kind of hand out to try and talk him into coming back.   This is a very poor management philosophy because it doesn't actually solve the problem at it's root  which clearly is management.  Anyone reading up on this place can see it's been the trend since it was opened... Top it all off I've been in the bathroom sick since 7 AM this morning and just now starting to feel better there is no way in hell I'm coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I like coming here before/after the movies since the theater is right there and whenever I want some wings. I like their fries/wedges also. The servers are nice. They can be slow sometimes. This one time it seems like our waitress had forgotten that we hadn't payed yet because she took a while and it was annoying because my sisters and I were going to see a movie afterwards. 
My two favorite wing sauces are red dragon which is sort of spicy and raging Cajun which I don't think is spicy. Just by writing this review I'm craving it now.."}
{"text":"Came in to eat late at night and they had a variety of Buffalo wings. I can't believe there were so many types. I was looking for Buffalo Wild Wings and the hotel had a list of place to eat and I stumble upon this place. Very good wings."}
{"text":"WWC is our weekly hangout. A friend bought his house nearby specifically because it's within stumbling distance of a bar. This bar.

I've been here probably 30 times in the last six months, usually on Tuesday night when they have their \"buy a dozen, get a dozen free\" special. (It's also good on the \"buy 8, get 8 free\"!) Clue: the specials are not available to go, but you can have them delivered to your table and immediately ask for a box. Beer specials are usually a choice of one or two different bottled beers for a discount and maybe a special draft. Tuesday has been $2.50 Corona/Corona Light night for at least six months.

The wings are very good. Meaty and well cooked with enough sauce (choose from 33 different sauces from \"virgin\" all the way up to \"Braveheart\"). \"Boss\" is my favorite. They recently introduced a new menu with more pub grub items like quesadillas and different burgers, even ribs. Trust me, you want to stick to the wings.

As said elsewhere, parking is a bit of a pain if you get there during peak hours. Don't park in front of the nail salon or the dry cleaners when they're open - they will tow you quickly. There's a lot across the street. And yes, the bathrooms can sometimes get a little out of hand. This is one of those times it's good to be a dude. ;-)

Every so often, they have a live band. Sometimes they're pretty good. Most of the time, however, they are entirely too loud. I know I'm old, but I'm not that old. I am here to hang out with friends and eat chicken and drink beer. Not shout at them. It was so overpoweringly loud once, I had to write my order on a napkin for the waitress. Maybe the management will get a clue and notice how the place empties out when the noise begins."}
{"text":"Popped in for a post-game beer (the Hornets won!) and to wait while the Lynx carried away most of the fans. No food this evening, just two cold ones at the bar. Lots of beer choices including a good few locals such as Olde Mecklenburg Brewery.

Bartender was good, seats were comfortable, there was little wait. All good."}
{"text":"I came here with my mama who I haven't spend time with in along time and she thought this would be a great place to eat but my  wings were cold , the brought out the wrong tray of wings . The waiter did not even say sorry she just drop the wings down and left and didn't ask if we needed any sides or sauce . I won't be back. by the Way I hate the epic center to many wanna be's . It seem as if the waiters only want to help white customer because they think they will get better tips  but that is call discrimination !!"}
{"text":"Was here tonight for a coworkers going away meet up. It was a good location from the job and they weren't too busy so they had room for a table of 20. Our server Alyssa was nice and really in point with taking drink and food orders as everyone was coming in joining us. She also was very prompt giving the checks as we went to leaving and returning right away.
The restaurant itself was very mediocre and the food wasn't good, partly because all of mine came out lukewarm or cold. I sent back the grand Queso I ordered because it had a runny consistency and it was cold. I ate half of my wrap since it was half off so only ended up being $4.50 and I was starving but that was lukewarm so it wasn't that good.
Pro tip stick with the wings."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite with some friends. I ordered a raspberry margarita (which was decent) along with some loaded fries. The food was okay. It tasted like something I could make at home and something about the taste made me a little nauseous... Besides that the restaurant was incredibly dark and I felt like I could barely see the food in front of me. The wait time also seemed pretty long even though we were one out of 3 tables in the whole place.. Overall, the experience was average. Considering all the other places I can eat, I dont think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the Wild Wings in South Charlotte for some time now, but our recent visit to the EpiCenter location has changed my opinion.  Granted, it was late and the food quality was still good, but I could not believe how terrible the service was.  The wait for service was so long we nearly left twice.  A disappointment for sure, but hopefully an anomaly."}
{"text":"Very average establishment. The server was very attentive when we arrived but the execution was poor. The wedge potatoes were just odd shaped fries and the wings were slightly undercooked. Not below food safe temperatures but lacked the crispy texture from the proper cook time. 

Cooking good wings is not rocket science."}
{"text":"Had a wing sampler at this place. Get choices not too saucey and lots and lots of flavor. Even the kids enjoyed it!!! Thanks for the food Queen City!!!"}
{"text":"I have a great idea. Let's have a restaurant that has all you can eat chicken wings, since the uptown in Charlotte seems to be lacking one.
This was the third time we attempted to go to Wild Wings Café for the chicken wing bar, and as usual, we were disappointed. The bar was empty most of the time. The flavors were pathetic, and the service was extremely poor. The manager did try to make things right, but it was too late as far as we were concerned.  They should stop trying to create chicken wing flavors that nobody has heard of and go to a much simpler model. Mild, hot, and BBQ, and plenty of them. 
If the stuck to this model they would triple their business. Unfortunately, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Wild Wing, you make my heart sing
You make everything blue cheesy, Wild Wing
Wild Wing, I think I love you
But I wanna know for sure
Come on and let me take a bite
I love you

Now that I just altered the lyrics to Wild Thing, I think you get it how much I love Wild Wing Café.  It's a chain and it's great.  The gentleman caller and I were STARVING after being at Carowinds all day and chicken wings were just the thing.  

This is one of the newer Wild Wing locations that I've been to.  Service was pleasant and about what you would expect for a sports bar.  We split 30 chicken wings and I'm embarrassed to say that there wasn't a single wing left over.  The Honey Lime Sriracha wings are my new favorite.  They're not that spicy, but they really pack the punch in flavor.

Sure it's pretty much like all Wild Wings, but it's so much better than all of the other wing chains out there.  Their chicken wings alone make me excited about football season."}
{"text":"Wings, fingers and drinks are great! 
The other entrees, not so much. 
Great place to watch the game or catch a few drinks with friends."}
{"text":"We had great service with Ashley W. The food was really good, their dip trio for an app was really tasty. The beer selection was great. The food came out w perfect timing even though it was busy. Ashley was very kind, professional yet super personable. I know this location had some hiccups in the beginning, but to their defense, there's no other restaurant like it in the area and people swarmed like crazy. Each time I tried to go prior, it was so busy I couldn't find a spot to park. Even in the neighboring parking lots. No restaurant is prepared for that and all of Gaston county must have been there. 

Highly recommend now, they have a great menu and awesome specials. Personally, I intend on going and asking for Ashley W each time. 

Can't wait to go the nights with live music!"}
{"text":"Well.....our first attempt to try a new place out in this location.

The soup was cold........

The salad was OK but nothing to write home about, as it did not seem to be super fresh, the dressings are supposedly homemade however I am not 100% sure if that is totally upfront.

My wife ordered honey barbecue that was not to be spicy and her wings came as honey mustard....

I am not One of the consumers that likes to send orders back or question orders so we took things as they were, however the staff was cordial the waitress was cordial but just did not seem to have everything together 100% including the food mostly.

Upon arrival we receded immediately however the table had to be cleaned as there were water and food particles on the table before they could put down our Setting or take our order."}
{"text":"Helpful staff, Great lay out and Beautiful Asian American Waitress. Oh yeah, they have decent food and decent beer."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give no stars! This was by far one of my worst dining experiences I've ever had! But where do I start? On arrival the people leaving informed me that I was better off seating and serving myself! No host! No one seating, anyone! I was in so many words told to sit at the bar. I had a party of three!!!! The guy that did seat us, after me saying I have three in my group stood there and rudely looked around like a was idk blowing smoke up his ass! When they were in the restroom! But on top of that, get our drinks from the bar - apparently they forgot the alcohol and used all the sweet and sour!! When asked the server to fix the problem, they then watered it down!! And stood behind the bar laughing with one another, towards our table. The server acted like he didn't even care we was present. I would of fired the whole staff! Then not even allowed to order the full menu, I then order wings! Which literally came out and looked pitiful! They were some of the smallest wings I've even received! Needless to say our service sucked!!!!! I will not to returning and I will see to it, I also call the corporate office! Zero stars! I hope they close that location down!"}
{"text":"We love their Phillies. Surprisingly juicy and flavorful. The Asian said is also good. It gets a little wild at night so take out is best for me at this place. Wish they showed hockey games too"}
