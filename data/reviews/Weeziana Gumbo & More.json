{"text":"I'm really sad that this place has closed. It was the best gumbo I've had in a long time and you could really taste the file spice that others lack in there gumbo."}
{"text":"I wrote the first review for this little place and for whatever reason, Yelp decided to filter it along with many other excellent and unbiased reviews.    The food here is genuine and terrific.  The broth for the gumbo is so delicious and the flavors of the seafood and chicken really come through.  Everyone loves the bread pudding, but also give the pound cake a try.  They give you nice large helpings of everything, and I think I have tried all the items from the menu at this point.  Every time I am in the area I will stop by for some takeout, and I know when I get home I will enjoy all of it and know it will be just as tasty as the last time I had it.  I am a chef and consistency is very important.  Come by and try out this place...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Immediately greeted by Chef Congo. Very warm and inviting. Purchased the gumbo, corn bread and sweet tea. Each bite was complemented with the right amount of flavoring. The day was beautiful, so I enjoyed the meal at the park. Was so please with my selections I visited the next day and even inquired about catering for an upcoming event. Kudos Chef Congo!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic seafood gumbo.  Chock full of shrimp, crawfish meat and, the best part, crablegs.  Corn bread was moist and amazing.  Their house sauce is perfect mix of sweet and spicy.  Get the fried corn.  I had never had this kind before and it was really good with the sauce."}
{"text":"I have driven and walked passed this place for so long and eventually i came by with my boyfriend and we were both shocked at how internationalized it was. There was a few other places inside the cafe but Weeziana was out of this world - PHENOMENAL! The service and people were great and i just loved, LOOOVED there sweet tea and banana bread pudding/pie. There Gumbo and Red beans n' rice, cornbread were just soooo satisfying!!! I crave there food almost everyday. No joke. I couldn't be anymore happier with this cafe (:"}
{"text":"This truly is AS GOOD AS IT GETS! The bread pudding is properly entitled \"Slap Your Momma\"...it is DELICOUS :-) The seafood gumbo is delightful and the fried catfish is perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. To top it off the customer service you receive is outstanding! Please take the time to try this place it out...it is definitely worth the time and consideration #bestLousianastylefoodinVegas!"}
{"text":"I had the gumbo and it was DELICIOUS. The owner  greeted me with great customer service and was very pleasant. I can't wait to go back and try something different. I've heard good things about the fried corn so that's a must have next time. If you're looking for great food and service this is the place to be."}
{"text":"As close as you can get to a real New Orleans shrimp poboy in Las Vegas--and that's coming from someone who lived in New Orleans for a long time.  Reasonably priced too.  The fried corn on the cob must be tried at least once.  Haven't tried the fish plate yet, but looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Though it can sound like a cliche at first, a really good gumbo does require some heart and soul. It takes time and patience to make a proper roux, and to know how to balance the ingredients in a way that makes the flavor and texture of each one shine. And of course that special spice kick to bring it all to life. When you taste this gumbo you can sense all of that. And when you meet \"Weezy\", you can feel the heart and soul behind it all. Real."}
{"text":"Came here to try something local and found a gem. I had their N'Awlins chicken gumbo, fried okra and fried corn. Wasn't a bit disappointed in anything. This food tastes homemade and I plan to come back when I'm in town again. The sweet tea is country and perfect. The staff is as friendly as I have seen anywhere. That makes the food experience better. The one thing that would put Weeziana over the top and get 5 stars in my book would be for her to get her own place instead of the food court."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here and my oh my! I only have nothing but good reviews for them. I'm from CA and moved to Vegas 3 years ago and always look for the best southern food.   Usually, any restaurant we go to for southern food, it can be pricey. This place has the best priced food and the quality is great!! Words cannot really explain how amazing the food is because you have to try it yourself! The service is amazing as well and they are all very nice.   This is my new go to southern food spot for sure! Thank goodness I over tipped them a little bit before I even recieved my food. They are so very welcoming! I have already referred my friends to try out this hidden little gem. I know they will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Received a call from the owner, Lillian, to thank my fiancé and I for ordering so frequently. The food is delicious and you can tell it's made with genuine love. We order the seafood gumbo, fish po boy, and cornbread. The food always arrives hot (we order through RoadRunnerFood.com) and fresh. We wish they were open more often but other than that, this in our new go-to spot when I don't have time to cook."}
{"text":"this place is awesome!! dee dee can throw down.......the best gumbo i've had in years and the fish is seasoned and fried to perfection. the staff is super friendly and helpful they make you feel right at home. i would suggest to try the seafood gumbo, fried fish crispy, also ask dee dee to hook you up with her secret cornbread salad with a glass of sweet tea. i traveled from los angeles to las vegas for the food at weeziana gumbo. can't wait to return so i can eat again lol. this restaurant catered a play i was in called: midnight cry and the whole cast raved over the food. please please please don't sleep on this place. lord knows once you have it you will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Saw some recent reviews of Weezie's and i was stoked to see another placee for me to try GUMBO.  I luv gumbo !  I was in the vicinity yesterday so stopped by for lunch.  From what i can tell, they ust opened for the day ( 11:00 am ) - one guy working there and i saw about 5 order tickets he was working on so i was a little worried about how long the order would take.  I went with the seafood gumbo ( large - $7.95) and a shrimp po boy ( either $7 or $8)  It did take a while to get my food but not a big deal - it gave me a chance to look at the other food places in the court ( my first visit )   The gumbo was great !  Nice roux base.  I like that the onions and peppers were diced in small pieces.  Really liked that the bones and shells were in the soup - working class gumbo !!  I'm kicking myself for not getting a chunk of cornbread - it would have been the perfect lunch.    The po' boy was decent.  The shrimp might have been slightly undercooked but i liked the coating and a it was good sized for the price.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Im in a wheelchair so I cant drive to pick up anything. So, whenever I do not feel up to cooking, I call to order in something (anywhere) so it can be ready about the time someone gets there to pick it up. Weeziana NEVER answers their phone!! NEVER. & They say they deliver?? I wasnt even trying to get delivery, just make a simple order and ----- nothing. I dont how people expect to stay in business when doing things like this. Your food alone will NOT keep you in business, try having some etiquette, especially in business, and maybe you can see a boom in your restaurant."}
{"text":"Its use to be great but has since taken a step backwards. Tastes a lot like zatarains seasoning.  A lot of rice and very little gumbo."}
{"text":"Great Louisiana food. Catfish was tasty and well prepared.  The seafood gumbo (with real crab legs) was also excellent."}
{"text":"This was the first time I have ever tried Gumbo and it was delicious!! And the fish was awesome as well. And not only that, the staff was very very nice and accomodating."}
{"text":"Impressive! Don't let the location detour you. The food was exceptional and the customer service is even better. I was welcomed by the owner like I was an old friend. The gumbo was satisfying and the corn bread was better than my Mom's cornbread! The owner brought out a sample of her fried shrimp and corn. I know what I'll be ordering next time."}
{"text":"Took a while...took a long while for Weeziana to open but it finally did...then it took a much MUCH longer while for me to stop by and try it out. No secret to anyone that i'm pretty close to the owners of Wing King, Kaba Curry, and Tacos el Jefe's.   So today i just wasnt feeling Wing King or Kaba and Jefe's was closing. So...why not try some Gumbo? This experience really does remind me of the first time i had uni and the first time i had GOOD uni. So here's the story of my experience with Uni. First of all it's sea urchin. Whole sea urchin looks totally alien if you're not used to it. The soft flesh inside looks like what comes out of said alien's ass.   Now lets turn toward gumbo. First time i had gumbo was i think on the south side messing facility of Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni. I've never had gumbo before and it looked interesting with the crab legs and seafood and sausages. yeah...tasted like something that came outta an alien's ass. So every time gumbo was served i would get a small bowl and give it a shot just to be disappointed and it just settled: Gumbo = Crap.   Back to Uni, recently we found a sushi spot that offered fresh FRESH uni and holy that looks like an alien's ass batman the stuff was absolutely amazing.   Back to Gumbo, Went on a limb and ordered a seafood in a small size and a bread pudding on the side. first bite...absolutely friggin amazing it's like opening your eyes from being blind for your entire natural life until that one day. I havent had enough gumbo to full explain what i was tasting and how everything was balanced together. This meal totally made my day.   Bread pudding was quite amazing as well. Not overly sweet as i was expecting but balanced. The pineapple and coconut give a lot of flavor without adding to richness.   I came hungry and curious and I left one happy smiling ass motherfucker. What more could you ask for?   Yelp 100 - 028 of 100"}
{"text":"so, was just taking the son to a soccer game and noticed we were way early so decided to just drive around and saw internet café with all these little eateries.  My first thought was the Kabba Curry sign, but once inside I saw weeziana..then I saw bread pudding...that's all it took.  I ate most of it at the counter talking to the owners ...so very personable.  Then I ended up getting some redbeans and rice and sweet tea, which both were great.  I had the cherry and pecan bread pudding  and since my momma wasn't around I ended up slapping my son who was standing by me....it was that good.  I wanted to try more but had to get the youngin to his game, but you can bet I will be going back for more!!!!!"}
{"text":"Holy shit, you guys. This place is the real deal. I usually don't use profanity, but this gumbo? Polite words don't cover how amazing it is.  I took my BF on a foodie roadtrip to Louisiana last summer- the food is amazing, seafood and gumbo and boudin and crawfish, oh my! It's all phenomenal. But when we moved so far away, I gave up hope of having cajun food that good any time soon- but this place came up with a near-perfect score on the Yelp app, and I came within a week of moving to Vegas. From the outside, it's unimpressive and a bit odd- but don't let that stop you. You're here for FOOD, not ambiance.  All I can say is, this gumbo is damn amazing. I ordered a large seafood gumbo to go, got home, and have barely made a dent in the order and am blown away. The portion is huge, and it's chock full of okra, sausage, shrimp, crawfish, and crab- I'm pretty sure there's an ENTIRE crab in my container. I've counted two legs so far, and I'm only halfway through the entire order... Which probably isn't meant for one person, but they'll have to fight me for more than just a taste of this stuff!  On top of the amazing food is amazing service- I believe I was helped by the owner herself, who made a minor mistake running my card manually, and then went above and beyond to fix the issue. Totally unnecessary, but thoroughly appreciated!  Stellar food, spectacular service. Gonna be coming here pretty regularly- gonna have to grab some sweet potato pie next time! Maybe I'll make Sundays my unofficial Louisiana appreciation days- they're open noon to 4PM!"}
{"text":"Got to try for first time and definitely not disappointed.   Had a chance to to sample all the poboys along with their classic gumbo.  Definitely will return  Friendly and great serbice."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on the way home from work as I was feeling a little Southern cookin' and I wasn't disappointed when I got home.  Something to consider if you're looking for a place to go out to eat at.  It's in a Food Court setting and the AC unit for the whole place was down so it being summer in Vegas it was HOT!  Thank goodness I lived nearby and wasn't planning on staying to eat.  Regardless, should I have the cravin' for some Cajun I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"My father in law is from Louisiana and I've been fortunate enough to know what true soul foods taste like.  I've searched high and low in Vegas trying to find a place similar to my dad's cooking with no success. Tonight, my search is over!  We had Gumbo, shrimp Po Boy, fried and blackened pan seared cat fish, corn and the bomb Weezie sauce.  My taste bud was revitalized and craving has been satisfied.  The foods were seasoned to perfection as the way it should. This is true southern home cooking and hospitality!  Furthermore, they know the true meaning of customer service.  Keep up the great work. I will be your customer for life!"}
{"text":"It been long overdue trip back for some Weeziana Gumbo since CMYE months ago. I was in the mood for some gumbo and some slap yo mama bread pudding. Two things that really stood out for me and wanting too come back for more. Some reason maybe cause I order the chicken gumbo rather then the seafood gumbo. It feel short of my last experience. I thought it was bit on the salty side. I should have order regular size instead of large. Not that you can never get enough of A good thing in life. I felt with the large between the gumbo and the rice plus everything is so condense or packed in. No way you can enjoy best of both worlds. Or just could have been bitter that should have ordered seafood gumbo.   Still its good gumbo especially the seafood and even though not fan of the chicken nothing skimpy comes too the andouille sausage, chicken, and get your money worth of gumbo. Not just gumbo everything on the menu is nice size portion!! I also ordered the pound cake since there famous slap yo mama bread pudding was sold out. I was surprise not just fact that nice full piece not thin slice piece. It so moist and delicious!! All the desserts here are made fresh daily just like the rest of the menu. I am fan of Brain desserts at Wing Kings. Between both restaurants amazing bakery of cakes or pies that puts chain restaurants desserts too shame.   The staff or this night just the cook great guy, friendly, and talking stories about famous slap yo mama bread pudding dessert. It crazy too think that people call in on the phone everyday asking about it. They place order over the phone non left for non phone orders. If ever get chance that one dessert that AMAZING."}
{"text":"I have had Gumbo from so many prople but this Gumbo was by far exceptionally good...I have given it a shout out on Facebook and hope people will vis I t..When I called back to give kudos to Chef John I had the pleasure of speaking to the owner who gave me the history of the Gumbo. Thank you so much."}
{"text":"#1: Never, EVER put mustard on a poboy. That let's me know that you DON'T know the real deal.   #2: Can these cats keep anything in stock before noon? They run out of EVERYTHING.   For these 2 reasons, I haven't been back in ages."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Weeziana while reading Desert Companion while getting coffee. I told my wife that there is a place that has excellently reviewed gumbo. Cajun based food is rare here in Vegas so we had to try. My wife and I along with our daughter went today and we are not disappointed. The gumbo was spicy and filled with lots of wonderful cajun style meats. I love spicy food so this was right up my alley. My wife had the Shrimp Po' Boy which was delicious as well. We talked with the owner and she was very nice lady. We told her we would write a review and invite friends so that is what  we are doing. Go check out this excellent food for a super affordable price! Next time I am getting a Po' Boy for myself along with some Slap Yo Mama Bread Pudding. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and great folks!   We really enjoyed ourselves at Weeziana gumbo and more.  My wife had the Shrimp Po-Boy that was overflowing with shrimp and sprinkled with their Weezisauce. The sauce is sorta like a removable but spicier and better.   I had the fish basket (sole) with fries and Weeziana and a small seafood gumbo with shrimp crab and lobster. This was a good bowl of gumbo with a nice dark roux.   It was our first time their and everyone behind the counter treated us like family. (No, the good way)   The meal for both of us was just under $25. BONUS!   The only thing that they need is a bigger sign so you can find them. They are in a food court next to a car wash.   I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sooo they jumbo supper bomb ...prices are just right but ...I've been a fan for a year now the owner is really sweet n nice. The fish yum yum yum the sweet tea always a buy plus free refills ...when I want fish instead of going to marios this is the place ;*)"}
{"text":"5 STARS***** for the GUMBO! DELICIOUS!!!  3.5 STARS for the Fried Catfish & fries. It was good but I've had better. The portion was a little small for big appetites but I was satisfied. No leftovers though.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Someone call the Five-O cause I just made out with a heaping bowl of the best seafood gumbo for less than $10!    Speaking from someone who grew up from the South, this gumbo is as good as it gets.  The gumbo is Nawlins-esque bursting with flavor with chicken, sausage, shrimp, crawfish, and crab.   I've had all the other gumbo's (Lola's, M&M, you name it - none come even close to Weeziana's)  I also had their cornbread which was delicious and Espy gave us a fried corn on the cob sampler which was the sh@t!  The cornmeal breading was perfect.  Everything here is so cheap and you get gigantic portions.   The service is so South friendly you have to check this place out at the Charleston Campus Commons."}
{"text":"This place was like home.  Being from New Orleans the gumbo is off the chain.  Highly recommend the gumbo. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have ate everything on the menu and EVERYTHING is so GOOD. I recommend everyone to come and try. I don't even like my Grandmother's Bread Pudding, but Weeziana's is ON POINT!!! The Gumbo, oooweeee is so darn good! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Everything is fresh and tasty!!! Seasoned to perfection and made with LOVE!!!!! Not to mention cheap!!!! They give 10% off to student...Fam got it going on!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best gumbo I have ever tasted. The location may be hard to find at first, but once you do, you will have struck gold. I highly recommend trying the Weezy Corn and classic Gumbo. At the prices this place sells them, I'll be coming back again soon. Not to mention the outstanding service and caring attitude shown by the entire staff. Definitely a Must for anyone craving delicious, authentic food straight from Louisiana."}
{"text":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place! the food took me back to being in my mom's kitchen learning how to cook. I was fortunate enough to meet the owner and she is just as nice as her food is good...and that's saying a lot!  I can't wait to bring my friends here, they are gonna love me even more!"}
{"text":"Homemade food using top notch ingredients and recipes passed down from great grandma. Fabulous gumbo with complex layers of flavor. Chicken gumbo without shellfish is available for those with preferences or shellfish allergies. The fried okra was the best I've ever had. The fried fish was stellar. And the owner also fixed us up some off-menu corn bread salad that I wish I could have finished but I was sooo full!  I can't wait to return! This place absolutely rocks."}
{"text":"OMG! All I have to say is move over M&M, Miss DeeDee is in the house!!  The seafood gumbo is AMAZING and each bite is packed with a punch.  Fried Okra is the best I've ever had, fried catfish just melts in your mouth and the SLAP YO MOMMA Bread pudding makes you say 'dayyyuum this sh** is good\". Miss DeeDee made us feel like family with her southern hospitality.  Miss DeeDee, please don't  change your recipes or substitute the ingredients, everything is PERFECT!  Comfort food at it's finest!!"}
{"text":"Shared the classic creole seafood gumbo, shrimp basket, fried okra and pecan pie with a friend. Hands down best gumbo i've had, great service too. Everything was fried fresh, shrimp and okra were delicious. Gumbo was super hearty, finished every last drop.   Good food, dont miss it if you're I'm the area!"}
{"text":"After our hike at Potato Knoll, we stopped by this Charleston Campus Commons to try out some food.  It's rare that we are on this side of town, so we just had to maximize the trip.  We were sold immediately on the seafood gumbo after hearing the ingredients that go into a bowl of gumbo.    OMG, I haven't tasted such delicious meaty gumbo for quite some time.  The flavor was bold, there were shrimps, crab meat, crawfish meat, drumstick, sausages...um um um...definitely took me back to Louisiana.  This bowl of gumbo is as good as it gets.  There is no competition, Weeziana Gumbo & More is the place for some delicious, decent-priced cajun food."}
{"text":"I have driven past this place many times and never thought there was any business in the building until recently. The building itself is nothing to look at however when you walk inside you will see that there are several places to eat at. It looks like a food court just like the sign says.  We ordered the seafood gumbo and the seafood platter (catfish, shrimp, crab and hush puppies) from Weeziana Gumbo & More. It was delicious especially with the Weezi Sauce. We will definitely be back to try the other food they have."}
{"text":"Weeziana's is where it's at. SUPER friendly right off the bat. Great service and delicious food for the super low? No way?! yup this place has it. What's even better is that this is probably one of the best southern style cooking I have ever had and with the price too I just can't complain.  Shoutout to Chef John! The best seasoned and cooked fish I have ever had."}
{"text":"Really, really good cajun food.  I had a small order of the seafood gumbo (amazing) and some hushpuppies, but the owner also gave me a sample of the chicken gumbo (amazing), a free piece of fried corn on the cob (really good, never seen this before), and a sample of the Slap Yo Mama bread pudding which had pineapple and coconut (super amazing).  The owner was incredibly nice and gave free samples to a few other people that were waiting for food.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a very satisfying meal!  The owner, Espy puts a lot of passion and love in the food.  Everything is made to order so there's a bit of a wait.  Had the seafood gumbo, fried catfish, fried okra, sweet potato pie and a touch of their bread pudding of the day, banana.  Her hot sauce is delicious and the fried okra and fried fish were really great.  Very generous with the seafood in the gumbo and the sweet potato pie was a great finish!  Staff was attentive and thoughtful.  All very affordable!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem indeed! The catfish was the best I've ever had. Gumbo was delicious and the don't skimp on the seafood. They deserve their high ratings. Walking in , I was a little skeptical but was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. My friends went to the other eateries in this food court and enjoyed their food as well. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I had the good fortune to try some of Weeziana's gumbo when I was at Campus Commons for our CMYE Reverse Spring Break.  At that time, I got a container of chicken gumbo to take home (my wife won't do seafood).    Yesterday, in a funk about what to do for dinner, I thought it was time to go back to the Commons and get some more gumbo.  I got a container of chicken (for my wife) and a container of seafood gumbo (for me).    Their gumbo has a rich flavor with just enough of a spice to give it some good taste.  I don't use hot sauce with their gumbo because I want to taste the great gumbo flavor.  The seafood gumbo had a fair amount of seafood and it was a great meal that I brought home.  This is now a fast food place to go when I want something different and tasty.  Service was excellent!  I am a fan!"}
{"text":"The SEAFOOD GUMBO r the only words I can utter right now!!!! And yes, I'll be back to pick up my order to go at 5:00pm. So generous w/the crab and lobster! LOVIN' IT!"}
{"text":"We were told the gumbo here was amazing . . . . best in town.  And to Weeziana's credit, it is delicious, but it's super hot (as in spice!) and too hot to be enjoyable, in my opinion.    I've never been to a place that was out of so many things that seem to be a staple to their business/menu -- we're talking out of cornbread, hushpuppies and fries!!  No fries with my po'boy??  Seriously.  The fried okra we had in place of hush puppies was ok - it was a little bland and tasted fried with batter, but needed some ooomph!   My mind (and my belly) were excited about the ice cream and caramel pecans for dessert . . . . but as luck would have it . . . \"we're out of ice cream\".  Really??  The atmosphere lacks, so I thought the food would make up for it.  It's in a food court type setting with 4 or 5 other food eateries and tables in the center for all.  It's just not worth the time.  The owner is pleasant and very friendly - she came by to see if we were \"ok\" a few times.  I guess that's why I gave it 2 stars - I like customer service.  But I also like to be fed when I go out to eat. :)"}
{"text":"AMAZING! This is REAL CAJUN! I'm from East Texas and have lived in Vegas for 8 years and this is the first time I've had Gumbo that tasted like home! Its the real deal, no cooking from a cookbook here, these people live the food :) I'm looking forward to many more meals to come. Watch out waistline....! My son said \"I can taste the bayou\", indeed!"}
{"text":"Preface:  my mother is from Louisiana and I spent much time all over the state growing up and later as an adult.  I LOVE and actively seek out Cajun cuisine where ever I go. I visited this establishment while in the area for business.  I looked up some reviews and decided to give it a try.  I ordered catfish and red beans w rice.  The fish looked great but was very tough and chewy.   Had a good taste but weird texture. I did not care for the red beans as they were watery and had little spice. I may come again to try the gumbo but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Whoa mama! I haven't yelped in awhile because frankly nothing has excited me much, until tonight.  I had high expectations after reading other reviews, but those were far exceeded upon first bite. Everything is made from scratch from family recipes, and this is a family that must eat VERY well. I literally got back from N'awlins on Saturday, where I had gumbo at the prestigious Commander's Palace. Weeziana's gumbo smoked their's out of the swamp water.   I give five stars, however, because everything else was just as good as the gumbo, and the owner/chef couldn't have been more hospitable and lovely. She had cornbread fresh out of the oven that she brought to the table, and it was the best I'd ever had. We also ordered the cornmeal coated corn on the cob, and she comped us some of her delicately fried fish served with a fantastic spicy aioli and Crystal hot sauce. This lady can fry to perfection!  I wanted the bread pudding, but I guess even after 6 weeks the dessert is becoming so popular that she was sold out. I 'settled' for the pound cake. Another item that fit in the category of 'best ever.'   Don't expect much in terms of the atmosphere, but expect tons in terms of everything else. The food, service, and value make this a MUST in my book. I'm grateful it's only ten minutes from home, but even if it weren't I'd drive distances to go here.   Despite the filling meal costing less than $20 for two people, I would give Weeziana's five stars even if it cost twice as much (maybe even three times).   Oh, and her son is super cute, too. He's sweet and happy with just the right amount of shy. He's lucky to have a mama that can cook like she does!"}
{"text":"Twice in my life I have had to make vocal sounds with every single bite of food and THIS place had me doing that because the food was JUST THAT INCREDIBLE!!!! I had the fried catfish and WOW! I haven't had food like this since I moved from New Orleans. If I lived closer I'd be there way too much for my jeans to fit but it would be worth it. If you want great food, you will find it here.  And now I'm going to cut this review short... so I can get in my car and drive to Weeziana's!"}
{"text":"We were greeted by the owner who was very nice and answered our questions. She was surprised that a pair of non locals had heard of this restaurant located in a fast food court. We each ordered a small cup of the Classic Creole Seafood Gumbo that is served in a styrofoam cup along with a spoon of rice. It included a few skinny snow crab legs that were not worth the bother plus chicken on the bone, sausage, fresh okra, shrimp, tomatoes and more. This proved to be the best tasting gumbo we have ever including while on visits to NOLA and Biloxi.  Our visit would have been incomplete if we had skipped the Slap Yo Mama bread pudding. Ann prefers a more custard-like bread pudding, so I was \"forced\" to eat a little more than her."}
{"text":"Best catfish EVER in Vegas. They also offer a couple of unique appetizers. A fried mini bread stick and fried corn on the cob. The corn used the same breading as the catfish so was spectacular. Sweet tea was good with free refills. Oh and the seafood gumbo - amazing! A slight spice and great pieces of crab leg inside.  To top it off, the main cook is such a delightful lady! 10 star service to my girlfriend and I! Will be back again for more catfish..."}
{"text":"Walking into the Charleston Campus Commons food court you would not believe me if I told you that there was lobster served there but it's true ... and it is found in Weeziana's gumbo along with shrimp, craw fish, crab, sausage... So delicious and affordable! I went there last night for a CMYE and was fortunate enough to sample some delicious food items on their menu. In addition to the gumbo I also had deep fried corn on the cob.. what??? haha yes what a unique spin on a classic favorite! The deep fried catfish with Weeziana sauce was also delicious and had that same sweet breading as the the corn on the cob. For dessert we had their famous \"Slap Yo Mama\" bread pudding. OMG I suggest asking for a corner piece which gives a nice bite to it. Everything on the menu comes from the owner's family cook book and some recipes are super top secret so you know that it has got to be good.   My favorite thing about 'Weeziana Gumbo & More' was the wonderful service from the owner, Espy! Such a genuinely sweet SWEET woman. Make sure to stop by to try her yummy food and don't forget to say hi to Espy and ask her about Lil Wayne ;]]]  HOT TIP: You can preorder your bread pudding and buy them in batches. They also don't just come in peach/pecan but in many delicious flavors!"}
{"text":"I ate the gumbo so quickly that I didn't have time to snap a pic. Chef Congo did not skimp on the shrimp. It was sooo... delicious; the okra was crunchy; the flavor was \"right-on\" the money and the rice was perfectly cooked - can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I had the steamin hot Seafood Gumbo on a mildly warm Saturday afternoon.  As I slurped on some gumbo rue, I found hidden treasures of smoked sausage, crawfish, real crab meat (none of that imitation shit), and shrimp. They also added some chicken in there, too.  Needless to say, it was a flavor-party in a Styrofoam cup.  They were not stingy with the meat at all.  The soup was not too watery but not too thick either.  I loved every spoonful.  What was missing though was some okra.  I think it would've made the dish even more complete.  I don't know if it usually comes with it, though.  Maybe they were out?    I really wanted to try out the Slap Yo' Mama Bread Pudding, but they had sold out : (.  Apparently, Circus Circus bought the whole batch earlier in the day, which is good for business I guess.  I'm still a little bitter about that - well, not really.   When I went, around 2pm, the fryer wasn't up and running yet, so I couldn't try out anything deep fried.  However, besides the lack of choices available that time, my experience here was pretty great.  The owner also stopped by to converse with us as well, so I found that as a nice gesture.  I will definitely be back to try out the other dishes, so hopefully everything will be up and running, and available.   The place is located in a food court, right in the same corner of Walgreens, which is across CSN Charleston, on the southwest side."}
{"text":"Go by mama's and n'em and ask Espy for her bucket sized bowl of gumbo, which comes in 2 varieties: chicken or seafood.  Don't forget to get a side of the fried corn on the cob, which is ridiculously slap yo mama & yo uncle good.  If you're curious about something, they are more than happy to hook it up with a sample.  They are still in soft opening mode, trying to gauge the market and streamline their business processes.  She is fixin to do an official grand opening in a couple months.  Espy, the owner is a lil sweetie with a big ole personality and some mean cooking chops.  All of her recipes came from her family.    They make a unique bread pudding daily, which was sold out when we stopped by for dinner.  I tried their sweet potato pie, but it wasn't to my palate, buuuuut then again I'm biased & spoiled because I grew up eating my North Carolina granny's recipe.   The only down side is the location & the fact that they close at 8pm.  They are in a small food court near CSN.  They are going to be mega-successful; it's just a matter of time before they expand to a bigger location.     The food is better than what you'd find in N'awlins."}
{"text":"The broth of the gumbo is the best I've ever tasted anywhere, but I'm afraid that's about the only good thing I can say about this restaurant. For staters, don't set your expectations too high. The restaurant is located in a small food court. You sit at community tables shared by the entire food court. Not a particularly good part of town. I wouldn't go there after dark. Your gumbo is served to you in a styrofoam cup. Tall and narrow. Hard to navigate. You eat with plastic utensils. The gumbo cup is filled with a lot of crab shell pieces which you need to crack open with the provided metal cracker utensil, but the pieces are too small to be opened. I tried to order a side of fried okra. They were out. Changed my side order to corn bread. Was told I've have to wait 30 min. for the bread to be prepared. Ordered red beans and rice instead. The beans were way overcooked."}
{"text":"First time here and customer is an A+. Lady was very nice to serve us. It's located inside Internet cafe food court. It's my first time trying soul food and I would love to come back for more for the catfish, it's too die for. Also their sweet tea is real good !!!!"}
{"text":"It was all hype!  As with most African American owned restaurants overpriced and short on substance.  The fried okra had great flavor but was undercooked and left it greasy.  The fries were horrible soggy and greasy!  The fish had good seasoning but was very chewy almost like fish jerky!  And the Seafood Gumbo was good but I'm still searching for some seafood!   PLEASE GIVE YOUR CUSTOMERS WHAT THEY ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR!  I will be trying your competitor Mamas Boy Cafe next time.  I'm a native Las Vegan looking for consistency in southern cuisine."}
{"text":"This place is truly amazing. I had the red beans and rice with a slice of cornbread and it was so good that it made me feel like I was in my grandmother's kitchen!!!! The service was as warm and wonderful as the food!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp po'boy. It was pretty good, I would like to try the catfish one the next time I eat here. It's a nice size portion and all of my colleagues enjoyed their lunches as well (swamp fritters, shrimp étouffée, and fried shrimp). They have really good sauces for the po'boy as well. I love the variety of the menu and the prices."}
{"text":"This is a little advertised place in the new internet cafe food court next to CSN campus on Charleston.  Best seafood gumbo I have found in town. If you like the spice filet, which is really what gumbo is all about, then you will love this gumbo.  We came just for the gumbo and were not disappointed.  Fresh crab legs, craw dads, shrimp, sausage and I believe there was even chicken in it.  The flavor is out of this world!  The owner and staff are wonderful.  I plan on returning often and bringing all the family and friends I can just so I can eat there again."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Love their gumbos and fried okra! Prices are very reasonable as well."}
