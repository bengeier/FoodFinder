{"text":"Our new favorite local restaurant! Amazing food. The chef is creative and takes delicious risks with her cuisine. The mashed potato egg rolls are an explosion of flavor in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner there tonight.  The mac and cheese is the best I've ever had!  Chef Arlyn always has a homemade soup, an unusual eggroll and the best burgers/wings around.  She makes homemade icecream and cobbler.  Attached to the local tavern, many beers/wine to choose.  Spreading the word on how good this new restaurant is!  Comfortable place!"}
{"text":"This food was phenomenal.  Highly recommend getting the Salmon or Moroccan dish.  Calamari was like none I've ever had...perfect.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  My sister and neice (certified foodies) recommended this place and I am in their debt.  I got one of several daily specials a grilled veggie wrap with hummus and her potato salad and my mother got the fish and chips.  Excellent.  What gets you is the nuances of flavors in everything and the unusual pairings.  The fish had a corn dog batter.  Yummy.  I wanted the Morrocan stew but they were out. :(  (I'm not a vegetarian, but I play one on TV.)  I will stop whenever I.m in town."}
{"text":"I feel fully qualified to give this review as I eat here at least once a week!  The chef is amazing and her menu is a fresh take on modern comfort food.  With different daily specials, you will always be offered something new.  Her chili is the best and make sure to order the special one that is served with a pile of cheesy jalepeno grits on top.  You will never go wrong with any of the daily soups or egg rolls.  If you are in to wings, hers are nice and crisp with the perfect amount of heat.  I really can't say enough about this place...the staff and food are awesome and I am so happy they are in my 'hood!"}
{"text":"We came here for an event a few days ago. I saw a few thing on the menu I wanted to try so we came back. The fresh made potatoes were so good I had to return. The place is small, it seats 24. Basically a one person kitchen but the food is amazing. Im a recently converted vegetarian (7 months) he is a carnivore. So I started with a mushroom wild rice soup that was amazing. Then the Moroccan Pot Pie OMG the flavors are so intense  there was a savory sweetness from both the white & sweet potato. He had the Cubano Panini & it's one of the best he's had, he's had a lot. The sweet pickles were so good. All local and made in house smoked in house. The bar being attached makes this the perfect spot. MT Glass. I hate leaving reviews for places like this because I don't like to wait but you've gotta try this place. Just leave a seat for me."}
{"text":"After reading a few reviews decided to give them a try. We were pleasantly surprised at their menu and variety of options. It's not a huge menu but they have something for mostly everyone. (no vegan options that I found) Party of three and we had 2 appetizers, a burger, veggie burger, braised beef, and finished with their house made vanilla bean ice cream on top of their peach blueberry cobbler. All of the food was very good. Their mac-n-cheese is stellar, the cobbler was amazing(not too sweet) and all of the dishes were hot, fresh, homemade, and tasty. We will definitely go back. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Had the Calamari with a wasabi aholi on them to start. It was fantastic. Then moved onto their awesome chicken wings. Seasoned, fried, then sauced.  Best prices for them in Cleveland Heights. Fish fry is corn dog breaded, which was different and great. Fresh housemade Coleslaw. Will be back soon to try everything else I didn't have room for!"}
{"text":"Everything was so good! Great portions, flavorful, made from scratch. Menu offers enough variety for adults looking for more than just \"the usual\" and for kids that are more selective. Service was great too! Owner will come out and answer any questions you might have. CHECK THIS PLACE OUT! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"After trying for a second time, I ordered a regular cheese burger and my husband ordered a burger as well because what he wanted wasn't being made that night. Again, very disappointed with the food. My burger was supposed to be med well and it came out rare, his was supposed to be med rare and came out rare. I took a few bites. Couldn't finish it. The fries were mushy again. I do wish our second experience were different than our first. But, it was actually worse. I hate leaving bad reviews. But, we will not be returning a third time."}
{"text":"This place makes my absolute favorite Black & Blue burger! We have been in several times, and the food always has us coming back. I recommend asking about any specials. When we have been in, the chef made up some creative tasties with what was available (egg rolls stuffed with pulled pork and greens???)."}
{"text":"OMG! If she has the black bean egg rolls the day you go, order them! Everything was amazing. The other person I was with had the fish and she said it was delicious, it's breaded in corn-dog batter. The cobbler was like my grandma made. Homemade ice cream and everything!!!"}
{"text":"A small intimate setting with good home cooked food is what you'll find at R's. The place is a hidden gem that quaintly connected to the M.T. Glass bar. Upon first entering, I was curious seeing that it wasn't too busy but my suspicions were quickly settled. You have the option to dine in the restaurant or in the bar adjacent and we chose the restaurant. I took one bite and couldn't believe how good this food really is! You literally can't go wrong from the standard menu to the specials. I've been here several times and can vouch for the short ribs, calamari, wings, and onion rings among other specials. R knows her stuff and has gained a new regular"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Interesting menu. Great burger and fries. Hipsters at Melt should come on next door for some real food and a wonderful old school bar. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Real food no processed junk here! Chef prepared, fresh veggies, affordable cuisine. Small and homey, eclectic decor, very comfortable! Food is excellent!  We've eaten there several times and everything is delicious. I highly recommend R's Chili with jalapeno grits, short rib dinner, all the appetizers are delicious. You can also order R's cuisine from the bar next door!  M.T. Glass serves the same menu if you prefer to sit and drink and watch tv."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on YELP and decided to take my family. We were instantly greeted and ordered our drinks. The waitress seems to be new but eager to please. I have an unique food allergy and the chef came out to discuss how she would handle my order. We found out that she makes everything from scratch. She even assured our picky daughter of how she made the vegetable. The food was perfectly prepared to our liking and was delivered promptly. The only disappointment was that they ran out of the dessert we wanted. I highly recommend this place."}
