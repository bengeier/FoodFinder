{"text":"We went there for Summerlicious meal and I have to say that although the menu looked appealing, the quality of food was far from it.  The food was mediocre.   All the summerlicious options were not listed in their regular menu.   I had the arugula with poached pears and toated pecans and was sadly disappointed at how mismatched  the dressing was, wendy's salad is so much better.   If you're going to do elegance, do it right and hire the right chef. The sea bass was dry and to top it off the dessert was like crums they whipped together with a minuscule piece of strawberry that was cut with the wrong knife. It looked broken off.  The staff appeared friendly and checked in regularly. Atmosphere, cute. Cozy. Definitely just average overall."}
{"text":"Love it! The vegetarian veg roll is very good, goat cheese on the side is a smart choice. The fries are very good and oh, the *Tower of onion rings*...Nothing like it! They are (Almost) all friendly, remembered my drink choices from previous visits and they were quick to take some cold spring rolls off my bills. I will say I have had two not so friendly servers, not rude but on the cold side, the rest have been great. It's a nice place to get a decent meal and some strong cocktails."}
{"text":"Chicken Pot Pie is a good choice if you want a hot soupy meal on a cold day, or something rich and creamy."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto for a business conference staying at a nearby hotel which recommended we have our group dinner at The Blake House and I'm glad we did.  The staff couldn't have been nicer, they planned a nice set menu for our group of 15, and the waitress totally took care of us while we were there.  She was attentive, checked on our drinks frequently and the kitchen got all of our food to come out together.  The group liked everything we had, a nice meat/cheese board, spring rolls, goat cheese crostini were great appetizers.  Our choices of entrees included salmon and a flat iron steak, both very well received but the vegetarian option, pappardelle with mushrooms was also very good (says the non vegetarian that ordered it).  Dessert sent everyone over the edge, a gooey brownie a la mode.  Nice selection of beers, we were looking forward to having something local and we were not disappointed.  A good evening all around!"}
{"text":"I have now been to the Blake House a half dozen times and the food has always been great.  The Prime Rib special on Sunday night is the highlight though.  It's under $20 and you get  Yorkshire Pudding, Mashed Potatoes and Veggies with your Prime Rib.  Ask for extra au jus."}
{"text":"Went to the Blake House last weekend for early dinner. It was very packed but the two of us managed to get a table. Overall the food was very good. While the place was packed and a bit noisy, we didn't mind it since we didn't go there for conversations."}
{"text":"Amazing service, food is incredible. I've had the mussels, greek salad and steak salad and they're all to die for. Extremely well priced for the quality and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant right off of Jarvis. Their homemade soup is the best, it's served with fresh bread and is delicious. I always get their Steak salad which I love. The wait staff is very nice and personable and it's beautiful and old on the interior.   My only complaint is that it has a little bit of a sports bar vibe so there are lots of big screen tvs around. That's great for watching the game or a casual dinner but not the best for an intimate dinner or a date."}
{"text":"Went with a friend that lives in the neighbourhood. We asked our friend to look for something kid friendly without being all up in your face and we have to say the friend came through with a bang.  We got there before our friend and we were seated promptly and scanned through the pub menu and we saw lots of stuff to choose from so it totally made our food options ample.  My husband had a beer and I had Cranberry Juice/Soda, and our kids both had water. Our daughter who is 5 got the kids menu and my husband's son who is 11 however looks like he is 15 didn't get the kids menu....ooh well the kiddie portions would have been too little for him as he eats like a CHAMP.  Our friend finally arrived and we dived right into the appetizer which we all agreed that we would try the Irish Style nacho's. Well let's just say it's kettle chips is the base for the nacho's and your usual toppings. There were good however, the good old nacho chips would have been better.  I ordered the Mixed Green salad with fennel and some dressing which tasted very fresh and very citrus infused. My husband had a chicken sandwich, which was so, so nothing really to brag about or special, our friend had a Cobb Salad and he said it was alright and the kids had burgers......  Well what do you know, the 11yr old should have ordered off the kids menu as the size of the burgers were huge. There was nothing small about those kids burgers. Our daughter that eats like a little mouse took one bite and she was full, well it's a good thing that we took it to go as that would have been a waste of money.  Overall it's a great pub, kid friendly and all, if we were in the neighbourhood we would definitely go back and kick back a few pints of beer and call it a day"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch!  I love the eggs Benny.  They have really good stringy home fry type side that is delicious as well.  And the avocado blt is my absolute fav.  Nice decor.  Very cozy in the winter with a nice warm fireplace."}
{"text":"I hope they fire the miserable bartender that served us. Don't worry, we will be back to give you another chance to redeem yourself. Be prepared to earn your tips!  Beaaatch."}
{"text":"Good selection of local brews and the food was good. I had the burger.  Nice big patio and inside the restaurant has a nice feel to it as well.  Only down side : A drunk woman was very rowdy at the bar and making lots of noise.  It was early but the barman probably should of stopped serving her drinks."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for dinner.  The good:  My friend and I had the chicken pot pie and the beef pot pie. They were really well made and delicious. A good portion as well - not too much and not too little. The serving staff were attentive and friendly. The restaurant was clean.  The bad: It was a Friday night and there was a group of friends sitting beside us that noticeably increased the volume level in the restaurant. Fortunately we were done dinner just as it was becoming intolerable.  A couple hiccups: My glass had lipstick on it, but it and my beverage were replaced without issue. We had to switch pies because they were placed on the wrong plates. These were quite minor though.  Overall, I would have enjoyed my experience more if I came on a quieter night. I would definitely come here again for the food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and the patio was packed. The three of us had beers, can't go wrong with beer but dinner was a disappointment. One of us had the Cesar Salad with chicken which was OK but two of us had the Flat Iron Steak Salad and it was minimal at best. The steak was good, what there was of it, but the salad was just weeds with no dressing. Thank goodness for the little bread they brought to the table. A great place for afternoon beers on the patio with maybe an appetizer or two to share but not for a full meal."}
{"text":"A big thank you from Counterpoint Community Orchestra to The Blake House for their amazing service staff, late evening on Sat, June 1st! The staff were so accommodating, attentive, and nice to our group! We talked, ate, drank the night away right up to closing time with world renowned and Canadian flutist, Robert Aitken! What a memorable evening! What a great way to finish the night after a fantastic concert with a world class musician! We had a group inside the restaurant and a group out on the patio.  We were so lucky it didn't end up pouring rain!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars out of 5 and easily the best winterlicious or any licious I've done actually :)  The decor is cosy and the staff welcoming. I had the crab cakes and aioli for appetizers, lobster ravioli for mains and chocolate brownie pudding with vanilla ice cream for desert. The appetizer and mains were glorious!! The crab cakes were flavourful and crispy and paired beautifully with the aioli. The lobster ravioli had sautéed sweet peas in a smooth butternut squash cream sauce and it was gloriously flavourful! My desert was good but not great, the brownie had a distinct flour taste and was harder than I like. I tried the creme brûlée from my friend and that was pretty good. Overall, a good experience!"}
{"text":"We were shopping in downtown Toronto on Sunday and we were tired and didn't want to go home to cook. Sure, we could eat fast and cheap, but why do that when, for a few dollars more, you can get quality food?  The Blake House is not the Keg Mansion! It's not crowded, it's not noisy, service is attentive, and portion size is big. It was Sunday, so we were in luck, there was a Sunday Roast Special for $20 per person.  Our Special included fresh french stick with a lemon zest and black olive infused spread.  Next came our choice of Salad. We chose the Mixed Berry Salad which included ... baby spinach topped with blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, goat cheese, toasted walnuts and balsamic vinaigrette. Mmmm ...  Our main was a tasty prime rib that filled me up, with a tight portion of veggies including (french beans, cauliflower, carrots, and roasted red peppers) with a side of Yorkshire pudding. My Mama always said, \"eat your veggies\"! She would have been proud of me tonight. Normally at home, we eat tons of veggies, but most restaurants never serve a LARGE veggie portion, from our point of view. Oh well, for $20 is was still a great deal!  Finally, though we were full, we reviewed the dessert menu and discovered, yes, they still make their own desserts!! The Crème brûlée with more fresh berries was too enticing, so we order one, and split it!  Another great experience at the Blake House. We will be back soon.  (Hey Robert D, the best price on Vodka is at your local LCBO. Take it home, and drink there. While you are at it, listen to some George Thorogood, okay buddy?)"}
{"text":"I always walk by this place and this time decided to give it a try. The food is pretty good, I give it 4 out of 5 stars. I ordered something off their special menu (shaved prime rib sandwich topped with swiss cheese in a baguette, and for the side I decided to get mashed potatoes (they were amazing!).   The vibe of the place is very cozy and warm, which was nice after walking in the cold for a bit. The reason I gave this restaurant 3 out of 5 starts is because of the service. Our server kept disappearing. We had to ask for the specials, instead of her telling us the specials were (maybe she was having an off day).   I would give this place a try again during the summer as it seems like they have an awesome patio!"}
{"text":"Early December. Daughter Ballerina class across the street allowed us adult time for 90 minutes. Time well spent, in the bar side. Not too busy at 6:30 on a Friday night upon arrival. Greeted and seated quickly.   Diet Coke was as expected but nice to have the server garnish with lemon. Makes me feel less like the Designated Driver. Beers on tap were plentiful for my companion.   Ordered a Brie platter and it was great with roasted garlic, caramelized onion and some other interesting options to augment the Brie and bread rounds. We were happy to have the owner drop by twice to check in and once he went back to fetch more bread rounds to help us round up the rest of the cheese. Attentive service by our server, another server and the owner. Attentive but not intrusive.   We got parking at the building on the same side of the street directly south but we always park there for National Ballet School. They advertised parking discount but that is impossible at this time of night (Fri at 8pm departure) as there is no attendant. $3 to open the garage door to get in and $2 to get out.   Great place to unwind and chit chat - I will be back."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited because this was my first Summerlicious. For appertisers, I got the fish tacos which tasted good and there were 2 of them.  The excitement died quickly because although the salmon (which was my main) looked great, it was really overdone and I had to send it back. When they brought me another one, it was cooked well but the rub was salty to the point of being inedible. I had to cut the top part off to be able to eat my meal.   I ordered the chocolate sundae for dessert because after an unappetising meal, I thought there was no way a chocolate dessert could go wrong. I was wrong. The only semblance of chocolate the sundae had was some chocolate syrup which tasted store bought. It was my fault for not reading the description of the \"Chocolate Sundae\" properly but I never imagined I'd have to look for the chocolate in a dessert which has \"Chocolate\" in it's name. Perhaps the restaurant can work on naming this dish to something more appropriate, like \"Vanilla Sundae\".  The service was great, no complaints there."}
{"text":"The Blake house is an awesome pub / bar.  We have never been disappointed with the food. They have the best nachos around. They cut their own potatoes instead of using nacho chips like other places.  The patio is awesome in the summer.   They have great heaters which allows you to sit outside on a nice fall / spring day. Love the place."}
{"text":"Summerlicious 2013 has begun! Great patio is the first thing that comes to mind when we got here. This is a big bonus considering their well stocked bar. Great for a group of friends to relax after a day of work.  The food itself is well presented, running on the salty side (seared trout) as noted by those who got it. The service was on the slow side, but with some attention grabbing the service was sped up. The quality of the servers was great, they set a relaxing atmosphere to enjoy dinner.   Would definitely go again, but ask for light on the seasoning."}
{"text":"Very good food, stout pie and fish and chips were just as expected. Everything has a homemade touch. Only change would be my cider was not as cold as I would have liked."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes passés pendant le festival dit winterlicious. Déçus quand même : soupe tiède, tartelettes au poireaux avec pâte moulée de supermarché, salade mesclun qu'on aurait pu acheter n'importe où sans valeur ajoutée. Dommage, le lieu est sympa et le personnel aussi mais c'est cher payé pour ce qu'on a."}
{"text":"I guess given the name, location and the building I was expecting better food.  Nothing special... Just typical pub food."}
{"text":"Seated at a quiet neighborhood in the heart of Toronto, Blake House is a lovely restaurant to spend an evening with friends and families. The patio in summer is excellent, staff are very friendly and helpful, and the food has very good quality."}
{"text":"Went there on the opening Saturday night for Winterlcious. Atmosphere was cozy and warm with a fresh fire crackling, which was echoed by their staff.  Had the tomato chickpea soup which was ok - lacked seasoning. The lamb shank with risotto. Lamb was delicious and slowly cooked. Love the umami flavour. Risotto was bland and slightly undercooked. Creme brule was spot on. Overall very enjoyable experience would come back again."}
{"text":"Went to Blake House - I like premium Vodka - I like a double - however Blake House likes to stiff their patrons - double the price for premium.  I can get a double Premium Vodka drink at almost anywhere else for $10 to $13 - however at The Blake House it's $20.  There are 33 ounces in a Litre of Vodka - at that price The Blake House is making $330/bottle - it costs $45 - I will never go there again until they change this ridiculous gouging!!!!  FU Blake House"}
{"text":"Service and food were excellent, randomly came across it thanks to yelp. Very happy first time customer!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. The crackling of the fireplace really added to the cosy feel!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place one more star because i really like the venue, atmosphere, and menu at this place, but the problem is the food just wasn't good. I will put the disclaimer that we were there on \"patio-opener day\" - you know, the first day where it feels nice enough to sit on the patio so everyone in Toronto is out having a beer? So both inside and outside were rammed, which I think in most establishments does tend to have an effect on food quality.  Starting with the menu: great selection and reasonable prices, both on the food and drinks.  Atmosphere: I loooove the patio. Large with big trees shading it, nice view, and I even saw a few heaters out there (which weren't needed).  Service: Pleasant and helpful, the servers know the menu and are very professional. They'll warn you if you're ordering too much and they know what is in each dish.  Food: Ugh, and here is where I wish I had nicer comments. Between the three dishes my table ordered, every single one sounded much better than it tasted and was in dire need of salt. The pork loin was dry, and the veggies on the side were doused in way too much vinegar. The beef stout pie was pretty insubstantial, with the pie collapsing as soon as you cut into it. The chunks of meat were small and unseasoned. So were the supposed garlic mash potatoes on the side which didn't taste at all like garlic and had an entire unmashed potato in it.  All in all, I would like to return to give the food another chance, as I really like everything else about Blake House."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cozy, the service is very friendly. Best fish and chips in the city. Good choice of beer and wine. Owners come out and talk to patrons. The cheese plate is great for sharing and tastes great. Great patio during the summer months and soak up the sun. Daily specials change things up. Have been coming and will continue to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Updating my review as we revisited.  We sat next to the table Edward Blake wrote the first prospectus on, apparently. The front foldout of the menu has a bio of the founding owner Edward Blake, so I studied the menu intently. Unfortunately this is where all the cool history anecdotes end and the food is just mediocre pub fare. While the inside of the house has a thirties ambience, the menu could not be more sports dad. Sandwiches, salads, finger foods. Our double date decided that we would have the chicken wings and nachos for starters. The melted cheese and chili were served over kettle chips which was a pleasant surprise. The wings were alright and probably the highlight of the meal for being not overly breaded yet still crispy. They were spiced enough to not require the honey garlic or hot dip we paired it with.  Our mains were all super greasy and bland. I had ordered the stout beef pie and it tasted like frozen vegetables had been stewed with powder gravy, swimming with gnarled pieces of tendonous minced beef cutoffs. It was served with a blob of mashed potato that resembled a D cup boob. I don't know why I'm making that comparison--it's convenient and was shaped that way?  I had no problems with the service however. The waiters were attentive and fast. ---- First visit: went here with my partner and his colleague, who had gotten a promotion at Blakes (lol). We had reservations and waited for half an hour, the host had sat other parties of 4 and whenever he walked by, seem to utter something incomprehensible and brush past us. We didn't protest, but the waiter seemed to make excuses about the other parties he sat without reservations. We ended up going to the keg."}
{"text":"Food was tasty!   I had the Stout Beef Pie and it was delicious and rich is flavour.  Our server could've been more on top of refilling our drinks. Overall, I'd go back for sure and try there patio seating."}
{"text":"I love the fries!  I don't know what their secret is, but I can't get enough of their fries.  I don't even eat them with ketchup or vinegar or gravy - just straight up.  On my first visit I tried the Avocado BLT because it came highly recommended.  It was fantastic.  Did I mention the side of fries were great too?  For visit number two, I didn't want anything sandwich-y so I chose the Capri Spaghettini.  (They only have one pasta option on the menu... or so I thought...)  It was very tasty, but the portion was small and there weren't a lot of vegetables, so I felt like I was just eating noodles in an oily sauce.  I later found out that due to my late arrival, I missed the specials of the day, which included a linguine with portobello mushrooms.  Lesson learned.  Always be on time?  Nah, always ask for the specials before ordering.  I love the wide-planked hardwood flooring and the feel of the old house.  I don't love basement washrooms.  Service was a-okay, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"I ADORE this place and better yet, it's my local!    My husband and I went for the opening night and have been frequenting the establishment ever since.   Jimmy is BY FAR the best owner, manager and all around nicest guy that I have ever had the pleasure to meet. He is so genuine and really does care about his business and his clientele. I would support that place, even if the food wasn't as good as it is, just because of that.   I agree with all the comments about the drinks. The beer selection is great, the wine list is okay and their martini selection and brunch cocktails are yummy.   The atmosphere is right up my alley. I love what they have transformed that old house into! It is a HUGE change from the Red Lion. Scuzzy to classy. Not to mention, siting on the patio during the warm weather is a home away from home for me.    If you really want to try something stellar at The Blake House (other than their tasty poutine and interesting twist on nachos), I highly recommend the following...   LUNCH - Smoked Salmon Salad - the best smoked salmon salad I have ever had and they don't skimp on the salmon, that's for sure.   BRUNCH - \"Wakey-Wakey Eggs and Bakey\" breakfast sandwich - my husband's favorite and it's all about how they slow roast and shave the peameal bacon...but be warned, it could give you a coronary!   DINNER - Chicken Pot Pie - comfort food at it's best, so flavourful, the crust is delish and it comes with a green salad on the side, so you don't feel like you are really over doing it.   SUNDAY - Prime Rib - for $17 they give you a massive slice of beef, mouthwatering horseradish mash potatoes, nicely cooked vegetables AND Yorkshire pudding. I have been to other places who boast a prime rib dinner, but they have neglected to include the Yorkshire pudding.    I love this place so much, that I am hosting my birthday party inside their private party room and I couldn't be more excited to have the event held there!"}
{"text":"Blake house catch FatCat by surprise first time FatCat go.  FatCat notice many boys in restaurant on date with other boys, and not girls.  Not what FatCat expect when FatCat read online reviews... and then FatCat remember that boys who like other boys generally very pleasant people... so FatCat go into restaurant to eat.  FatCat chow down on fish and chips. FatCat so happy with food that FatCat  call Blake House as \"excellent alternative\" for House On Parliament (also read FatCat review for House on Parliament as \"best pub in city\")  Things FatCat like  - Excellent food (FatCat recommend potato nachos for starter)  - Excellent decor and feel  - Excellent service - consistently  Things FatCat not like  - Nothing - like house on parliament, Blake House very good."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends for a mid week dinner celebration. We were able to take the entire downstairs area. Their staff were friendly and accommodating.  DRINK Their bar selection is not very varied and not extensive. I got a decent bloody ceasar for $6 but lacked the dressings you would normally expect.  FOOD I ordered their Blake Mac n Cheese with salad on the side, hoping that it would be a tasty namesake dish. To my disappointment it was actually quite tasteless and so I added flavour with pepper and ketchup. Two others in the party ordered the Mac n cheese and I could see that they were doing their own renditions of adding flavour.  Dishes that were popular and enjoyed by the group were: Fish and Chips, Gnocchi, and Chicken Pie."}
{"text":"A few of us went out last week to try out the newly established Blake House. It turned out it was the grand opening, so it was jam packed -- sadly there was no room for us on the patio.   The inside is gorgeous, lots of dark wood finishes. For some reason I had it in my head before I went that it was going to be just a typical, grubby pub. I was definitely wrong! The place has a classy atmosphere, and as Kat mentioned, even \"chic.\"  However, it's still relaxed enough that casual dress is just fine.  It took some time for a server to come by our table, I think there was a bit of a mix up between the server and the host. I was impressed by the selection on the drink menu. There was lots to choose from, some interesting cocktails, martinis and even frozen drinks.  Drink orders were taken and unfortunately they were out of the pinot grigio I wanted. I told the waitress any white was fine, just nothing sweet, and she said she would bring a Chardonnay. It ended up being a little too sweet for my liking, and -- ick -- tasted very floral. Partly my fault, I should have asked to see the wine menu. For drink number two I opted for a beer, since they had a pretty ample selection. I tried a Kronenbourg, and success! Officially my new favourite beer.   The menu had a pretty good selection too, lots of variety -- everything from poutine to some sort of samosa shepherd's pie. This isn't really my thing when it comes to going out to dine; I prefer to go where the resto focuses mostly on a specific type or ethnicity of food.  BUT if you're going out with a group of people who can't agree on what they want, The Blake House will solve your worries. I didn't order anything though (I had eaten beforehand, expecting traditional greasy pub fare).    I found the prices to be a little steep, and like Kat said they didn't allow \"grown-ups\" to order from the children's menu. Sometimes a gal just wants a snack-size portion!  I did try some of Karl's \"Oooey Gooey Toffee Pudding\"; it was tasty, but not not particularly gooey (or ooey, for that matter).  I agree with Chris that this place has a few bugs to work out, but once they do it could be a pretty cool spot."}
{"text":"Bravo! Certainly have transformed the place since the previous 'Red Lion'. Basic pub food with a little gourmet touch. Menu is well put together and service is excellent. The manager (or maybe owner) is soooooo friendly. I have a bit of a man crush. Lol.   I work at a bed and breakfast on homewood, which is right around the corner from the Blake house. All the time guests arrive with one thing on their mind. Where can I get a bite to eat nearby? I never hesitate to send them to the Blake house. A) because it's close and B) because it's got some really decent food. Nothing overly spectacular... But GOOD! my guests have always come back satisfied and happy. That's all that matters to me.   After sending many guests to this fine establishment, I finally got a call at the B&B from the manager of the Blake house, thanking me for sending so many guests over. Ummm, how sweet is that?! To top it off, I went there for my birthday and mentioned that I was from the bed and breakfast, and the manager bought our table of 10 a round of shots. AND the waitress bought me a personal birthday tequila shot. Happy birthday to me!!   All in all, go! You will not be disappointed. Good food, decent price... But the thing that makes this place spectacular is the service. I'm such a sucker for good customer service and this place takes the cake. So once again... Bravo Blake house!"}
{"text":"Great patio just off the beaten path of the village. Have been a few times and will continue to go back.  Food is reasonably priced of the most part. Have had brunch as well as lunch items. The Mac and Cheese with bacon as well as the potato hash that comes with most breakfast/brunch items are particular stand outs. The chunks of bacon in the Mac and Cheese are for sure worth the extra $2 as they are huge and taste great.  The entire meal including 3 cocktails, a beer and 2 brunch main courses came in at $60 even before tip, great value.  Only reason I docked a star is because on a couple occasions I have found the service to be a bit slow or un attentive, not to say everyone who's served us wasn't very nice and accommodating, they could just be a bit more aware of their tables.  Recommend."}
{"text":"This is a very classy pub in an old mansion on Jarvis. It's a busy spot with a great atmosphere inside (they even had the TV on the fireplace channel).  The beer list was mostly domestic, but there was a good list of choices. I was with a big group and everyone liked their meals. I had the pulled-pork and it was pretty huge. The meat was tender and the sauce hit the spot.  I was with a group of about 15 people, and they accommodated us well. The service was excellent, but my only complaint is that because the old house is narrow, we were all at one long table and it was hard to get in and out when someone had to get up from the table. Overall it was an excellent experience though."}
{"text":"dat prime rib sammidge tho!!!"}
{"text":"Visited The Blake House today for the first time.. So glad I did! We brought the sister-in-law and the wee ones here for a late lunch...  Terrific Service- great spacious patio- and delicious food.  I ordered the house burger with caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms, and spicy habanero sauce on the side... With the sweet potato fries (omg so good!)... My husband got the chicken club sandwich and regular fries. We shared. And I'm glad we did. Both were huge and amazing.  The kids ordered a jr burger and fish and chips. Those fussy eaters gobbled up most of it and loved the patio too.  Sister got the avocado club and recommended it for the next time we go.  We will definitely be back, glad to discover this neighborhood resto/bar!"}
{"text":"This review is mainly for the drinks specifically the patio area of this place. I joined a couple of Yelp Drinking Buddies (YDB) in the afternoon. Luckily the weather turned out to be warmer than expected. The draft list didn't impress me much but thankfully they had Maudite in bottle version.  The patio is nicely laid out though is right on a main street. I don't think I would like to be here when the traffic is flowing. Service was OK even though there wasn't much going on.  They allow cigar in the patio which pushed it up a notch for me. On the way out we got a shot of tequila which is ridicuously priced for a below average tequila."}
{"text":"The Blake House is literally in my backyard. I've tried it a few times and have never been wowed, but kept giving it a shot since it is so close. Today was the last time I'll ever visit. We went for Summerlicious--which had one of the 2 dishes we typically order. Upon arriving, the waitress said you need to make reservations to order off the summerlicious menu because it puts a lot of strain on the kitchen and they need to know what to expect. I could understand--but there were literally 2 other people in the restaurant. Plus, their website says nothing about making reservations for Summerlicious, nor is there any signage to this effect inside or outside of their establishment. She brought the menu to us and graciously allowed us to order. We received a nice size portion of a pre-dressed and over-dressed salad [that was inedible]--the pasta we are used to, minus all the regular veggies [only a few pieces of chopped tomatoes]--and a small scoop of ice cream that had been pre-scooped and frozen with 2 cherries on top (this was the cherry sundae). While I have had better experiences in this restaurant, this definitely made me realize that I've given them too many chances. It's too bad, the decor is lovely and the ambiance is nice (despite being pretty empty most of the time)."}
{"text":"I love the interior here with the dark wood and what looks like stone work on the walls and the cozy booths. As well as the fact it's In an old house in cabbage town  which are notoriously beautiful. The drinks are very good deals and the food is delicious. Steak dinner on Sunday is 19 which is a big portion w leftovers. Service was fast and friendly. Transit around here isn't the best by any means but it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"If the gorgeous patio complete with BOOTHS isn't enough to love about this gem, consider the Happy Hour from 3-6 Mon-Fri featuring $5 pints and bar rail a delicious snack menu and $7 glasses of wine. Still not impressed? How about the amazing staff who  all seem to be cheerful, funny and amazing at serving up some delicious food. There is a real neighbourhood vibe to this place, despite its stately size. During our visit, we moved in to the bar and several regulars were greeted by name. The decor flanks new touches to makes things feel updated with striking stained glass windows, an original fireplace and cozy seating areas. The building, itself was built in the 1890's.  They also have a private room downstairs for events. Charmed, I'm sure!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. They have amazing brunch and their drinks are to die for.  My only piece of advice is that young adults are somewhat treated with disdain, as though the servers have preconceived notions about tips. That is the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars.  Otherwise, the service is still fast, the drinks are phenomenal, and the food is great."}
{"text":"Ventured over on Sunday for a patio brunch and lucked out with a nice shaded area. Our server was sweet and prompt. It was a hot morning, so greeted us with a giant jug of water and then brought over some much needed water.  I like to enjoy a little savory and sweet, so my boo and I ordered the French toast and salmon eggs benedict. They were well priced, well portioned and delicious.   Our meal provided us with ample energy to explore the nearby trails. I'll certainly return."}
{"text":"Came back because the food is always amazingly consistent. The servers are always so friendly and attentive! Great spot for dinner and drinks. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Last night was my first trip to The Blake House.  The building is great!  A fun little patio out front and somewhat attentive staff.  As with most evenings out at a pub or bar, you are there to enjoy the drinks and the company you are with versus the actual food.  The group I was with was fabulous and I had a great time laughing and hanging with Renata R, Fabio N and a few newly adopted friends.  The food was okay.  The french onion soup had bacon in it - which totally sold me.  It also steered away from traditional in the topping.  Instead of having hot glorious onion beef broth underneath with a crusty mound of bread and cheese on top, the bread and cheese were quite on the scarce side.  This alone has inspired my winter mission - to discover Toronto's best french onion soup.  Their steak sandwich is actually quite good.  I ordered medium rare, and it actually came medium rare!  Served on a baguette and filled with red peppers, goat cheese and onions, I highly recommend this pick.  I also sampled the communal poutine - which was pretty fabulous and HUGE.  Absolutely a crowd pleaser.  Take a group with you and try out all their martini's and order the poutine.  You'll have a great night."}
{"text":"I love this place*disclaimer-* ambience for me is more important than the food so glean from this what u want.  I love the decor especially the fireplace.  It's hard to believe it was once the Red Lion a real hole in the wall."}
{"text":"A nice location and restaurant. My friend booked the room downstairs for her birthday. She hired a band to play for us. We were told to be quiet while the band played. Hence it's a small space for people to have a space to talk and listen to music. The staff were very nice."}
{"text":"After a long day of being a tourist, I needed a beer and a nice meal. The Blake House was relatively close to the downtown Hotel I was staying at and it was open late on a Sunday which was a bonus. I also was not feeling very adventurous so it was good to find a pub that looked better than the average.  The beer selection was nice. They had a nice local cider that was sweet but not overpowering. I did not want a heavy meal so I order the charcuterie platter. Prosciutto, Cheese, and olives that were not overly salty.   The space was pretty empty, which is to be expected on a Sunday night. There were plenty of screens playing the Blue Jays and football, so if you want a nice low key spot to watch sports this will suffice."}
{"text":"Great restaurant/pub. Enjoyed wings on a Saturday night and two excellent pints of beer. I'm always a little wary of ordering draft given how many pubs maintain (or rather don't) dirty lines but my Mill St Tankhouse and Amsterdam Nut Brown were fresh and fantastic. The wings were good too. So good we have decided to call this gaff our local that's not really local."}
{"text":"This place is great! As others have mentioned, it has totally transformed from its former \"Red Lion\" incarnation.   It's got a similar vibe to other Jarvis Mansion conversions such as the Keg Mansion and the Grand Hive, but with a less corporate feel.    I was first here to watch one of the Stanley cup championship games, and though by no means a sports bar, most people were tuned in and there was a great friendly feel despite the competitive edge.   The food here good \"English Pub\" style food.  They've got sandwiches, burgers, and a selection of other main entrees. I got the Stout's Pie and would definitely get it again.  I think I had the best meal of the table.    Food wise, I would probably avoid the Caesar salad, though.  Or, at least, know what you are in for.  It's not a regular Caesar dressing, but a vinaigrette that's really mostly just oil.  So it's kind of an oily, not particularly flavorful salad.    That being said, one bad salad wont keep me away!  Everything else about this place has been great!"}
{"text":"Each year our Manager thanks our hard work by taking us out for a night of good times and dinner.  We make reservations for 20 and have been doing so for over 6 years.  Service is fun and friendly and it always amazes me how all our dinners arriveso we can enjoy eating together.  We all order differently...some the steak others dishes like the ravioli.  This year I enjoyed thier Cob Salad.  Delicious!!  Over the years I have had thier chicken pot pie...great!  Thier Portabello burger...mmmmm, and also thier fish and chips...perfection. Consistently friendly and a beautiful space.    Love you guys at The Blake!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful restaurant and great food. This was the first restaurant my friend and I went to when we visited the city.   I ordered the chicken pot pie and tried the Blake's Splash, which is Passion fruit alize, vodka and 7up. Chicken pot pie was fresh, warm, and wonderful to warm you on a chilly night. The Splash was sweet but fragrant, and I need to find a bar in Buffalo that serves something similar.   The inside is just as beautiful as the outside. It was such a lovely food experience and our server was a doll."}
{"text":"What a great meal we had here. The atmosphere is relaxed and the staff is super nice. We started with the Calamari. We both agreed that it was the best we've had in Toronto.  Being originally from NY we have both had our share. Theirs was superb. My partner had the fish and chips. He said it was the best he's had since his childhood.  I had the Roasted vegetable wrap with sweet potato fries. The herbed goat cheese made this wrap one of the best I've had in a long time. We'll go bach for sure!"}
{"text":"Had a nice beer/diinner/dessert evening with my wife a month ago. Very nice atmosphere, drinks and food. Parking on the street was easy a block away. The food was quite tasty, staff were helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Three stars for the service, not for the food. The service was 4 star quality, we had a very attentive waiter who was very charming and made me and my brother feel very welcomed. However the food was 2 star quality. The food was disappointing at best and whomever wrote the descriptions for the food definitely took some artistic license. The kale salad was amazing but didnt have enough croutons to even be mentioned, which is a shame because the four croutons were delicious. The smoked duck was more linguine alfredo, and while the linguine alfredo was delicious it had clearly from frozen peas and four thinly sliced pieces of duck, definitely not the smoked duck breast meal I was expecting from the description. My brothers stout braised short rib was a large pile of dry mashed potatoes and a short rib that was mostly gristle that my mom could have made better at home (and my mom's only a passable cook). Finally, the creme brulee was described as being served with a variety of fruit, I wouldn't call the four blueberries atop the small portioned creme brulee as a variety of fruit. My brothers toffee pudding was very disappointing and tasted as though what they chose to call toffee came out of a can. Overall a fairly disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and service make the Blake House one of my favorite restaurants in the Village. Operating out of the former home of  Edward Blake, the second Premier of the Province of Ontario, the Blake House offers a diverse menu of popular selections, a full service bar, a spacious front patio which is ideal for dining and get togethers during warmer months.  It's an ideal spot for small parties, and Jim (General Manager) and his staff always go the extra mile in accommodating small office parties at the last minute. From small social soirées to holiday parties, the Blake House has a sizable lounge area with full bar in their basement level that provides a private setting for guests to mingle.  Amazing appetizers from samosas, chicken wings, poutine (in single serving containers), and sliders are some of the many appetizers provided for group events. I highly recommend that you check the restaurant when you're in the area. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch with friends and the service was brutal. We waited for just under an hour for our food. The inside of the restaurant was dead but the patio was somewhat busy. Not much food was coming out of the kitchen and our server disappeared for long periods of time.   Ambience was nice and the food was acceptable.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Nothing better than good ol' comfort food during the cold winter. Even better when you get to sample a variety of items for Winterlicious.   Came here with a group of 10 so we made reservations ahead of time. Service was fast and attentive. The food was pretty good too. I got the salmon off the Winterlicious menu which was seasoned and blackened perfectly but still remained juicy. The lamb shank option looked and smelled incredible. The meat was fall off the bone and it comes with a side of mashed potatoes. You can never go wrong with mashed potatoes. As for dessert, the carrot cake and creme brûlée are definitely my top choices. Their dessert err on the sweet side, but I'm a sugar fiend so I didn't mind.   It's a nice rustic setting to get together with friends or to bring a date. Definitely check it out even if it isn't for Winterlicious. You can't go wrong with great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Such a great place! I came here for my birthday and it was amazing! Jim one of the owners came over and made sure we knew the history behind the restaurant which added to the experience. A jewel in Toronto for sure!"}
{"text":"Went here for Summerlicious 2017. The gnocchi was far too salty, nearly inedible. I recommend the strawberry pie and strawberry drink, however - both were tasty.  The service was good and the atmosphere pleasant.  I wouldn't recommend it, and will likely not go again."}
{"text":"Formerly the Red Lion, The Blake House has renovated and updated the menu. Great large patio. Excellent variety on the menu. Try the calamari, Apple Glazed Pork Chop."}
{"text":"Good view of patio and salmon. Ideal place for business lunch."}
{"text":"A great place to dine and feel at home. Gourmet pub food with a slight Greek flair on some menu items & specials. I would recommend exploring their specials at every opportunity, the owners have taken great care to attend to the menu and food quality as well as to the environment of the restaurant itself. The staff truly make the experience truly remarkable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"In my unofficial quest to try every pulled pork sandwich in the city, we came to the Blake House for some pub styled eats.  We started with Irish Nachos and chicken wings with house made bbq sauce. The wings were pretty forgettable, however the nachos were very interesting as instead of nacho corn chips they were made of slices of potatoes that were deepfried to a thicker cut crispy kettle chip basis and then loaded up with stout beef chili. They were heavy sitting but let me tell you, they were delicious! Full marks!  The pulled pork sandwich receives decent marks as well. There was a healthy amount of nice and tender pork on the bun. The sauce was pretty average but well applied. Only part that really lost me was the \"Tangy Red Cabbage Slaw\" which came alongside and just tasted like red cabbage and vinegar.  The place inside has a nice feel for an average pub vibe. Its all very clean polished which bodes well for it. I like that they give tables of 4 to groups of 2 people instead of splitting the tables up in efforts of having more people but more crampedness.  The servers were nice and seemed relatively on point although could be a bit more proactive in following up with checking if we need more drinks or condiments, etc. Bonus points to this place having parking for $3 in a garage lot next door, although I wouldn't be surprised if they hit capacity frequently.  Overall, I'd say give it a go and try the nachos if you do!"}
{"text":"We went to the Blake House on Thursday for Winterlicious. All 4 of us enjoyed our meals. My choices were the soup, pasta, and bread pudding, each one delicious. I have been to the Blake House many times and have become friends with their waiters ( restaurant friends). I go back because the food is tasty and the service great and friendly."}
{"text":"I live down the street from this restaurants and for some reason I had not tried it until recently. Its a more upscale pub in a beautiful old house with a large patio upfront. The service was welcoming and great throughout our night and the food was surprisingly good for pub food. A great spot in an area where there aren't too many good restaurants. We shall return."}
{"text":"Came here today for brunch with a bunch of friends. It's a really cozy place and then even have a fireplace. Ordered the eggs Benjamin ( eggs benedict with smoked salmon) and it was delicious they also used fresh orange juice for their mamosas which made it taste sooo good. My friends ordered the eggs benedict, hazelnut and banana pancakes and lemon and blueberry hotcakes which they all agreed tasted like heaven. The pancakes/hotcakes were very fluffy. The only downside was the washroom, it was clean but had a very bad sewage smell. I would definitely come back though"}
{"text":"Seasonal ingredients, always fresh, in dishes that always reflect the season. The patio is well appointed with special heating to take away the chill of the autumn evening. The service is attentive and courteous. What a great place to experience a neighbourhood dinner."}
{"text":"Went for the first time for winterlicious 2017. Absolutely superb, lively but not loud atmosphere. Love everything about the ambiance of this upscale pub. Service was prompt, friendly and accurate. The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcomed. Tried the blackened salmon, and lamb shank, both were superb and cooked/seasoned to perfection. Excellent value, and having looked through the regular menu, the value is not just for winterlicious. Honestly our experience was all positive, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Terrific place.  Great décor and the service was the best I've had in ages.  The service was out of this world.  Really good food.  Chicken pot pie very much recommended and the Cobb salad was delicious.  Oh, and the calamari appetizer was really good as well.  Everything on the menu looked wonderful.  Reasonable prices for wine and beer.  Terrific atmosphere.  I'll definitely go back.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very good food!  We really enjoyed our first time here.  The steak was just fantastic and the server was more than helpful to us and our out-of-town guest.  :)"}
{"text":"I want to give it three stars only for the house but for the food.... Two stars no more.. I visited there a Friday afternoon, of course the restaurant was almost empty. I waited to be seated and ordered one ' The Blake' mac n cheese to go, add mushroom for $2. The food packed well with another box with salad. But unfortunately, the taste was not good. The mac n cheese was creamy but not cheesy, and portion of mushroom was too small . Fine, salad was OK without their salad oil. Overall, if u come for a drink, the ambiance seemed good but never expect to eat the real food."}
{"text":"Was really craving some pub food and my boyfriend looked this place up. Decent reviews and not hard to find parking on the street right infront... So we decided to check it out!  Natalie greeted us as we entered. For a Friday night, it wasn't all too busy, but everyone seemed to be enjoying their time here. She's amazing by the way! More on that later--  I ordered the chicken and gouda Canadian club sandwich and my boyfriend had the Blake house burger. Both were fairly decent tasting and well portioned. I loved the fries!!! My club sandwich had the usual lettuce, tomatoes, Gouda and grilled chicken. Chicken was not dry and there was quite a big piece in there so every bite was full! No soggy bread and over all, very nice sandwich! The burger was juicy and they remembered to keep the tomatoes out as requested.   Funny story. Boyfriend has some of my sandwich and has to take the tomatoes out first. Natalie, the amazing server, comes by and goes ,\"ohh was that tomato hiding in your burger!?\" And instantly we explain it came from my dish. But I thought it was really sweet and wonderful how she recalled and wanted to make sure we liked our food.   Natalie was amazing and so cheerful! Checked on us just enough and was very helpful with recommendations and letting us know the days specials. :)   The food was not anything special but it was a good meal and the staff were great. I think that's a nice balance to keep me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I visited The Blake House (\"Blake\") for the Summerlicious lunch menu. I was excited to try  Blake given its close proximity to my office, the 4 star Yelp rating, and the spacious patio I had seen on a previous walk by.  While the patio was very nice and relaxing the food was lackluster. My meal companion (\"MC\") and I left Blake extremely unsatisfied.  The vegetable tempura was oily and nasty (I still don't know what vegetables, if any, I ate). MC had the caramelized onion and field mushroom crostini which tasted decent once we scraped off the overwhelming amounts of blue cheese. The burger I had was overcooked. Thank god they got the fries right. The worst was the tasteless linguine (I've had better frozen meals).  The \"fresh\" strawberry pie was far from fresh. While the chocolate sundae is actually more of a vanilla sundae it was the best part of the meal. The service was slow considering it was a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW (9/12/2012):   I came back here on Sunday and this place is seriously rad.  I ordered the prime rib special for $17 (incl. mashed potatoes, vegetables and yorkshire pudding).  The mashed potatoes were really good, and the prime rib was juicy and cooked to my liking.  The yorkshire pudding was delicious, but I could have used some more gravy (dumb of me not to ask though).  The portion sizes are perfect too.    The service this time was incredible.  The waiter was very attentive and friendly.  The manager (I think) came over to chat a couple of times.  I noticed he was doing it with a number of tables.  The first time it was because he was clearing our plates and left the bread and butter basket.  I mentioned how I really liked the butter which had dill in it.  He said that the herbs were fresh from their herb garden, which I was delighted to hear.  The second time he overheard me talking about a Greek restaurant.  He asked me how I liked it (I didn't), and proceeded to tell me how important he thought fresh ingredients were and that they use all fresh ingredients, and told me about their Greek salad.  Not only was that informative, and good to hear, I thought, this is a smart guy.  He probably didn't even care about my opinion of the Greek restaurant I was talking about, but what a smart thing to do, seizing that moment to comment on his restaurant.  Good job!    I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"As a traveling business owning woman on a work trip to Toronto I rolled up on a Friday eve around 8pm to a half empty restaurant, it took a while to get seated (what everyone was so busy doing I can't imagine), I was then offered a seat as tucked away as possible by the \"maitre'd\". The restaurant by now was a third full, lots of wait staff and yet after 20 minutes I had yet to be offered a glass of water let alone asked for my order.  I left.  So tiresome.  Whoever owns this restaurant and if they are on this earth because of a woman needs to clean house.  Its 2017 and to be treated by this is pathetic."}
{"text":"The Blake House is an awesome place for dinner - comfortable, great location, very good food and a great atmosphere - love that it has the restaurant side and the informal sports bar kinda side.  The service is generally good, however sometimes I have felt a bit less than special when they are busy.  Hosting is friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Great place to go for lunch. They had Muskoka on tap and a great burger. It was not crowded so the atmosphere was relaxing. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"The Blake House has a real fireplace.  I just want to highlight that first and foremost. I'm so tired of fake fireplaces and fake candles.  I'd like to be near a dangerous, hot, sizzling open flame.  Well, the Blake House delivers, and we had a lovely two-top right next to their honest-to-god wood-burning fireplace on a cold, winter night.  So nice!  Ok, enough gushing about the fireplace.  This place hands-down beats the other pubs within a short walking distance: Blake House (greater than) Churchmouse and Firkin (much greater than) O'Grady's (for the mathematically inclined, Yelp doesn't allow the greater than or less than symbol...must be lazy programming) They have the standard Toronto selection of beer from the macro-microbrews (like Mill Street) plus some slightly more interesting ones like the Okanagan.     Food: the food is generally pretty good here, but it won't blow you away.  On my last visit I ordered the steak sandwich.  Here's the telling bit... Waitress:  How would you like your steak done? Me: Medium.  (I think for a second) If I ask for medium, will it actually come out medium, still pink in the middle? Waitress: I just push the \"medium\" button on the machine, the rest is up to the kitchen. Ok, so how was my steak done?  I'd say somewhere between medium-well and well...there wasn't a hint of pink.   It was, however, very well seasoned and tasted quite nice.  The fries were great too.  My friend was happy with his food as well.  The service was pretty good. Friendly, not intrusive.  We were checked on often.  Now, they don't care enough to actually cook their steaks to order, but it's so much better than other pubs near the Village, I'll give them a pass.  Overall, I really like the atmosphere of the place, and while the food had some issues, I was still satisfied at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Lesson learned: When you go to a pub-grub place, don't order steak... even if it's JUST $20.   So... I ordered the \"aged\" steak on the menu. It was really dry and not medium rare like I had asked for. The insides were pinkish brown... not the slightest bit of pinkish red. You know what that means? Cooked from frozen. Ugh. Also, the blue cheese dip that it came with sort of made me hurl in my insides. But that's my fault; should've ordered the green peppercorn sauce instead. Anyway, upon complaining, the waitress was nice enough to offer me another dish at once... but I didn't feel it necessary. I just kept chomping on my steak when the head chef came by and told us that he'd be serving us French Vanilla ice-cream on the house; which I think was SUPER nice of him. And god, was that French Vanilla ice-cream amazing. I tasted some sweet Carnation milk in it and mmmmm, creamy... and it's necessary to point out that I don't even like Vanilla!  I also ordered a Margarita. It tasted like super sour lime juice sans any alcohol.   My experience aside, note that this place gets quite packed for lunch. It's a nice little restaurant with cozy seating; perfect for dates, a meal with a small group of friends or work collegues."}
{"text":"I am thoroughly confused as to why this restaurant has received an average of 4 stars. Just came back from eating a VERY BELOW average meal. The bass appeared to be quite dry (it was in all likelihood previously frozen) and the 'risotto' was asian rice that I make in my rice cooker, tossed together with some peas, mushrooms and parmesan. It was very odd tasting parmesan on asian style rice. Lastly, my brownie and ice cream dessert came in a bowl filled mostly with whipped cream an below I found a small scoop of ice cream, a teeny brownie square and topped off with a fraction of a strawberry (like a tenth of one, literally)! It looked like they were cutting corners big time! My one positive statement is that the chilled soup was very tasty and the manager asked us a couple times how is everything. It is in a cool Victorian Mansion as well, but unfortunately the interior has been redone to look like any ol' pub."}
{"text":"Great food! Loved the chicken and Brie wrap. The only complaint was the slow service. Our waitress was busy at a lot of tables and took longer than normal to get our food (which might not be her fault) and our check."}
{"text":"The weather for patio brunch was perfect today. I ordered blueberry pancakes and their breakfast special. Reasonably priced. Had a very good waitress. Great service."}
{"text":"My family & I ventured over to the Blake House this past Mother's day for brunch (note: they take brunch reservations! perfect if you're looking to brunch in a large group!)  LOVE the atmosphere and decor of The Blake House. It really gives you more of a classy vibe compared to your generic pub, but still has that casual pub feel. The building itself is very old, but gorgeous. They have lots of pictures inside of different areas of Toronto & how it looked in the earlier 1900s.  There's lots of seating both inside and out, as well as a parking lot right beside the location if you're driving instead of using transit.   Our server was really sweet & friendly. Service was a bit slow, but it was a busy Mother's day, so that's to be expected.  We started off with the Baked Brie for the table. Oooooohmygod. If I were basing this review on that Brie alone it would be a five star. This is a legitimately delicious dish. I highly reccomend it for sharing (it's an entire wheel of brie, so you probably don't want to tackle it solo!) The brie was baked to perfection which gave it a yummy flaky crust with just a tiny bit of crisp, and of course on the inside it was all ooey gooey goodness. It comes with roasted garlic crostini, red onion marmalade, and a red grape reduction to eat with. Simply a heavenly combo. Mmm.   I had the Monte Cristo for my main. It was good! I really enjoyed the shaved back bacon. I found the french toast a teeeeny bit dry (though I am quite picky about it, to be fair :) ), but other than that a very decent Monte Cristo, though nothing to write home about like that Brie ;).  My mother had the Mushroom Benny & gave it rave reviews!   Overall, a really great experience and I will most certainly be back (since that Baked Brie is invading my dreams! Visions of baked brie dancing in my head?)"}
{"text":"I booked a dinner here on a Friday night for my family. With toddler niece and nephew in tow, we have to plan our dinner spots strategically.  When we arrived, the manager Jimmy warned that it was louder than usual indoors, as there was a table of office workers present that had been hitting it pretty hard since lunch.   They were indeed loud, but my niece and nephew provided some stiff competition.  I'm posting this update though because the following day, I received a call from Jimmy checking back on how dinner was, again concerned that the rowdy group had interfered with our dinner.   It's rare to find that level of customer service. It being a pub, alcohol-induced noise is pretty much par for the course. I appreciate the manager going that extra distance."}
{"text":"Classy pub food. A very nice patio in the summer that almost always has a spot available for cause it's off the beaten path."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and drink selection. Very friendly staff. Beautiful big patio. Food was edible but not fantastic. Also, it would be better if their patio was non smoking (or at least smoking was limited to a particular area of the patio). Doing so would have raised my review to a solid 4."}
{"text":"Clueless wait staff, mediocre food.  Thinks a Cobb salad and Greek salad are the same thing and when I asked for a lime for my drink, I was ignored.  When I asked again the waitress gave me attitude that she'd \"have to go upstairs to get it\" as if I didn't ask for it once already.  If you don't wanna hear my drink order, don't ask for it.  When she brought it she HANDED me a slice of lime.  No thanks, first time was the last time."}
{"text":"Dined here last night with a birthday party of 8, based mainly on the fact that the birthday boy was also named \"Blake\"!  I had to call ahead several times for last-minute changes to our reservations, and despite my mild pestering, the owner/manager John was unfailingly polite and accommodating.   Everyone had a seriously fun time - the food was excellent, the service was friendly and  quick, and the vibe of the place was relaxed and cozy, but still full of energy. Staff were working their butts off as it was the first night of Winterlicious, so huge kudos to them!  Also had some British ex-pats with us, and they were very impressed by the Brit-influenced menu and authentic pub atmosphere.  We've vowed to bring \"Blake\" back here every year for this birthday, as well as methodically trying everything on the menu named \"Blake\"! We're already making reservations for next week again - can't wait!"}
{"text":"Situated right in front of the beautiful Canada's National Ballet School, on a victorian mansion, the Blake House will offer you great food and drink experience in a beautiful, beautiful place.   This is not your regular neighbourhood pub. They make poutine with style - au gratin, mas oui - and everything served will look beautiful. Too bad the crème brulée tasted just regular. After having astonishing entrees and main dishes, I was truly expecting a mind-blowing dessert.   I was a bit disappointed to learn they didn't have some basic items (like caesar dressing) that afternoon and the waiter couldn't find out if there was a \"soup of the day\". At least this made me choose their poutine and I definitely don't regret my choice. You should try it too!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time in 3 years and quite dissapointed. Special of the day as advertised on the chalk board outside on the side walk was \" prime rib\" only to sit down at. 6:30 and be sold out. Order a bottle of wine and not get a glass of water till dinner is over. Order from there summerliscious menu and the polenta is served cold. 1 main item to get right part of their 3 course meal and can't do that right. Partner orders wings and they come out soggy with cold fries. Pathetic. Dinner finished 30 minutes ago and still waiting for a sundae as part of my fixed course which i didnt want in the first place. This place will die out with the seniors that filled the placd at 6pm. Not reccommened."}
{"text":"Ended up here Saturday night for Winterlicious. The place was packed and had good atmosphere.   We were taken right away and our table was in the basement part. I was a little hesitant because I don't like sitting in \"dungeons\", however it was nicely presented with lit candles and a lounge area as well.  Service was great and the food came quickly, however we were not rushed which is always nice.  Some places for Winterlicious want you in and out of there because they can use the table for others who want to spend more.   I had the French Onion Soup - It wasn't baked but I didn't mind.  Broth was tasty and enough cheese, onion, and bread.  Next up was the Lobster Linguini with peas and a white wine creamy sauce.  It was enough to satisfy my hunger  I usually don't like white sauces but this was not and not too much cream which always seems to be the case.  To top it all off I had the creme brulee!   DEVINE!    Some of my friends had the Fruit Crumble and were disappointed because it seemed too \"healthy\" haha.   Rolled oats on top.  We also had bread/butter to start and I like whatever they did to the butter.  It's been mixed with some herbs but I can't figure out what.  I would definitely come back here and perhaps try their actual menu.  Parking is a little sketchy I have to say - $3 in an underground parking lot and $2 to get out.  However I was lost getting from the car to the place - I don't like creepy stairwells!  Who know who you find in there :("}
{"text":"Same rating, but I wanted to mention two things: FREE WIFI! Just ask how to log on, it's easy.   And... the great prime rib dinner they do on Sunday nights.  $17 for a huge slab of beef, grilled veggies and really yummy garlic mash. Oh, and a very traditionally-made Yorkshire pudding (which, for the uninitiated, ain't at all like pudding).  I still find this place to be a bit noisy since the makeover - the surfaces and fixtures really bounce the sound...but I still recommend giving it a try.  It's usually quite busy now, a good sign."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and I always forget to check in!!  The Blake House is where we have our \"catch up\" dinners with a few of my former co-workers.  It's in a really cool old house on Jarvis, and has a great big patio out front.  Once inside there is a long bar to the left and a nice seating area to the right.  The whole place I would say holds about 150 people inside when sitting.  The food is great, fresh, and unique.  Make sure you have the Irish Style Chips.  They are nachos, but instead of tortilla chips, they use kettle cooked potato chips.  Speaking of the menu, it's limited, but has a good selection and mix.  A few salads, pastas, burgers/sandwiches and apps.  In regards to the staff, I've never had a problem with any of them.  They are all fun, attentive and know their menu.  Regardless of how busy the place is, they wait staff is always prompt.  Check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I used to live by the Blake House for a few years, so I frequented it quite a bit. It is a great spot for after work drinks, a casual date or weekend brunch.   The Blake House interior is lovely. It's nice, cozy, comfortable and makes you want to stay there for hours. The outdoor patio is huge and gets quite busy during the summer but I don't remember every having a problem getting a table (I did avoid this place during the Pride though).   The staff is very friendly and welcoming but sometimes it gets pretty slow. The food is great. I've eaten here many times for brunch and dinner and I've never had a bad experience or been disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a gift certificate to The Blake House and chose to use it for brunch. I know it sounds mean, but I really was expecting average food from The Blake House - not sure why. But wow, portions were great, prices reasonable (under $16), but more importantly, the food was delicious! I got the lemon and blueberry pancakes, and being a lover of pancakes, I was relieved to see a golden crust and moist middle. There was a hint of lemon, but it was not overpowering - they were memorable!  My friend on the other hand is a steak snob, and when he decided to order the steak, I began to prep myself for a conversation on how wrong the steak was cooked. But thank God! Though not perfectly medium, it was juicy, well seasoned, and in his words, \"this is so tasty!\" Tasty is the word he uses for delicious.  I have to also mention the great service. We were not bombarded with attention, but when we needed something, like a coffee refill, they were on it!  Thank TBH for the opportunity to try items from your brunch menu. You have become a \"must return soon\" spot. Will bring my friends next time."}
{"text":"We visited the Blake House during a vacation in Toronto and it was one of the nicest meals we had there. My husband had the Summerlicious menu and I got the prime rib \"Sunday Roast.\" The food was very good, the space was lovely, and the staff was very attentive and friendly. Just a really nice evening out, all around. Thank you, Blake House!"}
{"text":"This was the final stop of our Pride crawl. I ordered a martini and it was okay. It's a personal preference, but I don't like martinis in a short glass and that's how this one was served. Boo hoo...I know. Our server was pleasant and apologized for not being as attentive as she should be. I hadn't found her inattentive, but I did notice a table of gentlemen sitting behind us who were getting grumpy because no one had come to take their order. It was Pride, so it was very busy- especially the patio. I liked the atmosphere in this place; classic without being stuffy. I would be happy to return another time and sample some of their food."}
{"text":"Brunch is delicious, everything else is meh. Totally overpriced for the neighbourhood. There are always men at the bar who seem to be friends of the owner and sometimes I've been ignored while the staff fusses over them."}
{"text":"Went to Blake House for thanksgiving dinner and it did not fail us! You can't go wrong for turkey and trimmings with a side of veggies and mashed potato and apple crumble dessert for only $23! It was really tasty and not dry at all. We don't have a reservation for a Sunday night but we were seated right away. The service is fast for drinks and the main dish but we waited for about 10 mins for our dessert but it's ok  Overall, excellent experience!   We'll go back for brunch or try their prime rib next time!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Food is very good with a very decent menu. The inside has been restored to perfection. A touch on the expensive side but still well within reason."}
{"text":"I came here for a UYE with some fellow Yelpers. I figured that since the place just opened we would give it a week before attempting. The evening that was planned happened to be their grand opening so the place was packed. We had wanted to sit on the patio but had to resort to sitting inside.   On the patio they had an oyster bar set up. I'm guessing this was just for the grand opening as I didn't see anything on the menu about fresh oysters. The patio is quite large and probably holds a good 60 people.   Inside, this old mansion has been restored to it's former glory and includes a wood burning fireplace and magnificent stained glass window. Hanging on the walls are old pictures of Jarvis street and the mansions that grace(d) the area.   They have a very diverse drinks list that includes beers, mixed drinks, martinis, and more. They are also reasonably priced with most of the drinks at $5-6. I was quite pleased that they had Grasshopper on tap.   The menu has a good depth and range of items and is accurately priced for the portions and quality. Most of the entrees range from $10 to $14 though there are a couple items that go as high as $18. The appetizers and soups range from $7 to $10. As I was sitting right outside the kitchen I saw many dishes pass by and they all looked scrumptious. The chicken wings look plump and saucy and the fish and chips look light and crispy.   I debated starting with the poutine but decided to skip it in the end and just went with the signature burger; The Blake House. The burger is $10 and comes with pickle, tomato, lettuce, and fries. You can add extra condiments for $1 each like cheese and caramelized onions as I did. Unfortunately the burger was really disappointing. It was very average and the the caramelized onions were skimpy. If I'm paying a buck to have a condiment put on I would expect that there would be enough if it that I could taste it, or at least be able to tell that its on my burger. The highlight of the meal was the salad that I swapped for the fries. It was their house salad with mixed greens, red onion and a vinaigrette. Very well done.   To finish the evening, my wife and I shared a creme brulee. For $6 I thought the portion size was a little small compared to Karl's sticky toffee pudding for the same price. However, the creme brulee was very delicious. The top was perfectly charred and the creaminess below was smooth and rich.   For the most part I was very pleased with the staff. Upon walking in, a gentleman asked how many our group was and offered the two of us that had arrived a seat while they cleared a table for us. Our server was a little flustered for most the evening because of the grand opening which she apologized for near the end of our visit. Most of the staff are experienced as they followed the owners from the now closed Groundhog Pub at Bloor and Sherbourne to their new place of ownership.   Overall this is a great place. As with any new place, even though its the same staff and owners as another pub, they have some kinks to work out. This may be my new regular watering hole."}
{"text":"Patio!   Big TV at the bar and dining area!  Decent draft and bottle beer list!  It might not be the best pub/bar in the area, but I just love the cozy and laid back vibe of The Blake House!  Free Wifi!  I just wish the patio is not cigar friendly. Not good for non smokers on a windy day.  I definitely be back to meet up for friend for some drinks when I am in the area."}
{"text":"we went here for Sunday brunch at 11:30 yesterday.  Wasnt too busy (meaning you may not need a reservation) but it became busier later in the morning.  excellent food, great service, beautiful place inside, really very lovely ( also great price)  Ive never been here before, my daughter googled Sunday Brunch and this place came up.  Really very wonderful place ( I think they may have a patio in the summer) I will come back again.  We liked it very much!!!!!"}
{"text":"The former Red Lion Pub (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/red-lion-pub-toronto), which I never had the pleasure of visiting, has been transformed into a chic, upscale Bedford Academy-esque gastropub with a gorgeous, coveted patio. They literally opened less than two weeks ago and the patio was already teaming with people - I suppose a lot of them were former Red Lion fans waiting with bated breath for the new place to open.  Food was really, really great but overpriced. $11 for a B.L.A.T. sandwich sans B (bacon) is too much. I appreciated the small, manageable portions but the prices didn't reflect the quantity of food, especially since I opted for a meatless version (no price adjustment). The fries were outstanding - French Fry Crawl worthy for sure.   This is a four star pub to be sure, but the puzzling fact that a grilled cheese sandwich is only offered on the children's menu, and not scalable to adult size or price, truly made me angry. When I asked if they could please make it for me, the server refused, saying they could only make it for those 12 and under. An absurd ruling.   Try to get a seat on the patio; the location and atmosphere is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I was here for my good friend's birthday.  This place has a cool ambiance and its cozy and it is technically in a house.  MY ORDER Poutine - I have had better.  It was warm rather than hot so the cheese was melted and stringy.  The fries were shoestring style, where typically they are thick homecut fries.  Calamari - was yummy with yummy sauce.  The calamari had a light batter that was crispy and the calamari was fresh.  Loved it with a squeeze of lemon.    Jerk Wings - yummy, just the right spice.  There are many flavours that I am looking forward too next time.  Grilled Steak Sandwich - medium rare and it was juicy and tasty with the caramelized onions on a soft toasted baguette paired with a house salad dressed in a vinaigrette.  SERVICE We were a group of 20 and our server did very good.  All our orders were correct and we were checked in every so often to make sure we were good.  OVERALL I didn't give a full five stars as it was off based on the prices the quality should be a little bit higher."}
{"text":"Very good food with great service. Caesar salad and blake house burger are great.  For dessert, we got the brownie. It's good, but not phenomenal for $7.   Highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Visited this establishment for the first time on Friday evening around 8 pm when it was still light out. Ate outside on a rather nice patio, which even has booths. My dinner companion and I sat at a table for two by the sidewalk.  We both ordered a dirty Gin martini with three olives (per the drink menu). It arrived cold, but not cold enough, and was mostly olive brine and only had two olives. We should have sent them back. About 15 minutes later, our server arrived to take our food order. We both opted for their burger, mine topped with sautéed mushrooms and Greek salad on the side and his with cheese and fries on the side.  45 minutes later, and after no offers of another drink, our food arrived. The burgers were overly charred (basically black) and overdone, mine without the mushrooms which, when arrived a few minutes after pointing it out, were cold and flavourless. The Greek salad was far from being Greek. It consisted of some kind of leaf lettuce or spring mix (honestly, if you must put lettuce in a Greek salad, use a crunchy romaine), way too much salty feta cheese, a few small pieces of mealy tomatoes and cucumber and no olives whatsoever. The little bit of dressing was bland. The fries were good, as were the brioche buns. The small dill pickle quarter was rather unremarkable and commercial.  By the time we finished our dinner, it was dark out. The lighting on the patio was almost nonexistent. Late diners were arriving and had to use their cell phone flashlights to read the menu.  We then waited 20 minutes for our cheque. At any point, we could've just walked out.  At many points, we could've complained, but because of another commitment after dinner, we didn't have the time it would take to deal with having food and drinks replaced. Besides, our server never asked how everything was.   There's a large tree in the middle of the side of the patio we were on. Filling it with lights would make the world of difference. Eating dinner and paying for it in the dark is a real challenge, and navigating down the stairs to the sidewalk could be treacherous for those with limited night vision. The stairway lighting along the stairs is far too subtle.  If you're looking for a quick and satisfying drink and dinner on a lovely patio with a comfortable atmosphere and timely service (our server was indeed quite pleasant, though), this isn't really a place that you could rely on. It seemed that there were staff shortages both on the floor and in the kitchen. It's a shame, really, because the old mansion has an interesting history and the outside dining area could be quite lovely if more thought was put into it the overall ambience. Service and atmosphere aside, if an establishment can't do a burger right, I would hesitate to order a steak.   Disclaimer: I did not venture into the interior of the restaurant, so my comments apply to our outside dining adventure only. After all, it's summertime, and most Canadians would prefer to eat outside when given the choice!"}
{"text":"I opted for the Summerlicious menu and my friend got the chicken pot pie. The chicken pot pie was not good. The filling was too heavy and creamy.  I had fish tacos for fist course and it was a big first course, it was fresh and tasty. The dessert was creme caramel but it was too firm, not sweet enough and seemed hard and over cooked which made it eggy. The service was very good."}
