{"text":"I had very high expectations when I went in, but if I had went in with less expectations I would have considered returning. 

I didn't mind that the place was small, but I did mind that for the price I was paying the portions were quite small. Having experienced authentic ramen, I was rather excited to read about the house made noodles and old school broths that were made. I ordered the tonkotsu classic, and I was immediately disappointed by the mixed green salad that was on top. Then I noticed the tonkotsu broth was clear which lead me to feel that it was closer to shio than the creamy white tonkotsu broth that I have always known it to be. I was super disappointed when I tasted the soup which was way too salty for my taste. The noodles were good, but it is far from authentic ramen noodles. 

The only positive experience for me was the ONE slice of pork that the ramen came with. If they had advertised Shiki Menya as a \"new age\" ramen, I would have let many of the above mentioned things slip, but they are marketing their establishment as classic and old school Japanese umami...etc...etc...I am really not feeling it at all. This place reminds me of all these other restaurants that are trying to \"hipsterfying\" themselves. In conclusion, I won't recommend my friends to go, or return myself."}
{"text":"One star for OK ramen, otherwise this was maybe the worst service I've ever received at a restaurant. 

Where to start?  I really wanted to have a good experience here, as I've been a frequent customer at Shikiji for years, which is owned by the same family (ish) as Shiki Menya. I have a deep love for Shikiji and the people who work there, so I thought I'd try the new offering.

I'll start with the fact that when we got there and put our names down on the coveted \"list\", we went into the vestibule and hostess/server nearest to the door didn't greet us,  buy merely barked that there was a list outside for us to put our names down.

The restaurant wasn't too busy, so we didn't have to wait long. We were shown to our table and waited for a while before our server came by and threw a couple menus down and walked away. We decided quickly what we wanted, but it took us around 10 minutes to wave down our server who had seemingly disappeared. 

We started with the tacos,  which were actually delicious, except they came with a sad-looking tiny lime wedge that may as well have been a decoration,  since we couldn't get a single drop out of it. I waited for our server to come back to check on us to ask for adult-sized limes, but gave up after waiting long enough. 

The ramen bowls came quickly, which was nice. The food was good, but didn't quite measure up to Shikiji's. I couldn't finish my bowl, and asked to have the rest to go...except our server let us know that Shiki Menya doesn't \"do\" to go. The reasoning was because  apparently people waiting for a bowl and who get turned away outside after quantities run out complained about this in the past. So the logic is to get rid of \"to go\"? It's not like you're returning people's leftovers to the cauldron in the kitchen (I hope). 

So if this wasn't enough, when we received our bill we asked to split it 50/50, something we do at River Caf√© and Notable, but apparently this lowly peasant request isn't up to par at Shiki Menya. The server explained that splitting bills lags the restaurant during busy hours. As I looked around to see a couple empty tables and zero people in line outside, it became clear to me that our server, like many of his counterparts, gave absolutely zero sh*ts and was too lazy to attempt the impossible task of dividing a bill in half.

In a nutshell, Shiki Menya is Shikiji's hipster and ever pretentious little brother."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's the best ramen I've had in Calgary! I first discovered it listed as one of the top 10 best new restaurants in town by a magazine and boy am I glad I tried it out. The pork broth is creamy and tasteful, the noodles are freshly made, the char siu is grilled to great flavour, and their bowls are well priced. What more can you ask for? The restaurant is quite small and fills up quickly so the wait can be a while, which means it's definitely recommended that you get there as early as possible. Remember to look for a clipboard by the entrance to put your name down, otherwise, you will never get a table. Do be aware that the music is rather loud and that they only sell a limited amount of bowls everyday before closing."}
{"text":"Hip Hop!  Very cool atmosphere.  Art painted on skateboards on walls. Fast turnover - very short wait time for a seat.  Servers are very energetic, cool, and hip.  Noodles are great - it's like the buckwheat Japanese noodles but thicker and not so buckwheat.  Soup bases are very tasty - not salty. Char Siu is Pork belly and super tender!  Soft boiled eggs are perfect."}
{"text":"If there was a six outa 5 I would give it. 
I have been to Japan 3 times and this is the closest thing to ramen from the motherland of my favourite soup. An amazballz Tonkotsu done in the proper method. This place is the place to beat."}
{"text":"If you enjoy amazing ramen at a reasonable price, try this place out. I tell everyone I know to come here.

Things that you may not like:
-Sometimes a long line and a list you must sign your name on to get in while waiting outside. 
-Not many seats, slightly cramped area. 
-They only sell 150 bowls a day. 
-Not the greatest service because they are usually busy. 
-Parking (get over it, it's bridgeland... ) 
-Loud rap music. 
-No splitting bills, only cash or debit. 

What makes up for those things:
-The Ramen! 
-The prices
-The Ramen! 

Don't worry about the rap music, you will not need to talk because you are too busy eating!"}
{"text":"Wow. The ramen here is amazing. So good I think about it hours afterward. The best broth, too. Pair the excellent ramen with the cool atmosphere and great staff and you have an instant winner."}
{"text":"The wait here is ridiculous and so disorganized. I was standing outside and there were 4 empty seats for a long time and nobody was seating anyone .."}
{"text":"I wanted to check this place out and went on a Thursday with a friend. We arrived 12.28pm, I remember cause we had to write it on the waiting list. We waited about 15 mins in the cold cause we weren't allowed to wait inside. Be sure to bring your winter jackets or park right in front of the store to take shelter in.
I had to flag down an employee to take our order, inquire about our appetizers, and get the check. Seems like it was really one waitress doing her job while the others wandered around awkwardly.

I ordered the Goma Mazemen and the Gyozas. The ramen came in a huge bowl, but the actual serving amount was just moderate. I was expecting a pretty large serving for the price so I was disappointed in the amount I received.  
We didn't received our Gyozas until we were just about to finish our ramen, and they were nothing special and on the small side
The Goma Mazemen was very salty, everything else was fine. I did liked the noodles and topping, I especially like the meat they used, and I even enjoyed the soup base except for the salty part.

We had to sit at their barstool table next to a couple strangers, who were too loud and sat there the entire time sipping tea before they were politely asked to leave so another person waiting in the cold to come in and eat.
The seating was cramped and the restaurant too loud, I felt like everyone was shouting at each other.

Overall I found the price too high and the environment not too relaxing."}
{"text":"This is the only acceptable ramen restaurant in this entire city. Some may give this place a poor review due to the waits, but I feel like that's a pretty healthy indicator of how good the food actually is. Everything is made in-house, it's fresh, the staff are friendly, the service is fast, and the food is authentic and delicious. There's limited seating (~35 seats total), which accounts for all of the aforementioned qualities. I feel like the rest of the complaints aren't warranted. It's not their problem that you can't find parking! Come here for the food -- it's good -- no, it's really good."}
{"text":"My bf never had Japanese ramen before and he absolutely loved this place. The best Japanese ramen place in Calgary I'd say. Staffs are super friendly and I visited after 6 months of time and all the staff were still there! I think that really means something."}
{"text":"Like most small restaurants in Japan, this joint does one thing and does it right...ramen noodle soup. The noodles have just the right amount chew, and the chili goma flavours were in perfect balance with the spice, the nuttiness, the pork, and the earthy mushroom+bamboo all evident without any one overpowering. The right amount of fat was present to provide a satisfying mouth feel. A bowl is $14, but that's reasonable considering how delicious it is, and that it almost breaks my rule of not eating something larger than my head.

Besides ramen, a small number of appetizers are available. A small place with about 8 chairs at the bar (where you can watch the food being prepared), and about 12 tables, they do not take reservations. If there gets to be a line, wait.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"The ramen was very meh. I couldn't see myself even ordering it a food court. We had 4 bowls among us at the table and after sampling them all and having a bunch of my own I would give this place a fail in terms of food quality. Bland, flavorless soup and poorly made ramen. Not impressed; mind you the decore was pretty good but the wait time, for this, nope not again."}
{"text":"Trekked across Calgary to try out this ramen after seeing it written up in several Calgary magazines. We got there around 1:30 on a Saturday and there was a notepad at the door where you write down your name, when you arrived and how many people are in your party. They also had menus outside so you could see what you wanted to order while waiting. We only had to wait about 15 minutes before being seated.

We got the tonkotsu black ramen and the kara miso garlic ramen.

The tonkotsu had a very subtle yet distinctive flavor to it while the slickness of the Kara miso was the dominant taste.
The noodles were delicious and perfectly chewy and the slices of char siu were large and tasty.
One thing that would have made it better is if there was a whole soft egg instead of a half. 
The bowls of ramen were perfectly sized and the broth didn't taste absurdly thick like some other ramen places I've been to.

The next time I'm in Calgary I would definitely come back to try their other varieties."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a place like this to open in Calgary for a long time. After living in the South Korea/Japan area for a couple of years I had forgotten how good a solid bowl of ramen could be. I've only been there once, but the bowl of Chili Goma was amazing. I had to finish the broth! Just be aware that they only make enough noodles for 150 bowls since they make them fresh every morning. I'm sure eventually they will step up the number of bowls available in the future, but for now they open at 11am and are usually out of ramen around 2-3pm. So if you plan to go don't go too late (if you get there early be ready for a lineup). Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place has an eclectic ambience and excellent ramen. The chili goma is my favourite!"}
{"text":"Ramen is good, but very slow. I was told the wait would be 20 minutes and it end up being 1 hour."}
{"text":"Satisfies every craving I have. Perfect portion sizes, perfectly seasoned and flavored broth, OUTSTANDING PORK. My favorite part of the whole soup was the pork, beautifully tender, melt in your mouth, and charred to perfection, it was served blackened, with a very umami seasoning on the outside that brought out the flavour of the pork to another level, it was just delicious and it was definitely the focal point of the whole dish. I ordered the kara miso ramen, and it had the perfect level of heat, just the right broth consistency and the components such as the noodles and the coddled egg where all nicely done. The pork tacos where ok, I am not a big fan of fusion so it was not my favorite, two of them where definitely inadequate for what they charge. Obviously the pork in the tacos where the focal point, as it is suppose to be, but the sauce and the other components were somewhat absent, they seem to be just there. Gyozas were nice, not much else to say about them they were well made. I tried my dining partner's ramen and they are also a homerun. Now.. about the atmosphere; I understand that its Koki's restaurant and he designs it to who he is and all the power to him, nothing wrong with that, but in my opinion I am not a huge fan of the new world swag/hipster ramen environments that's trending nowadays, not to mention the \"hundreds\" worried bomb face thingy and other stickers that I saw stuck somewhere in that restaurant,  it can get cheesy every now and then. Our waiter was a spitting image of swaggy p from the los angeles lakers and Bruno mars put together, everyone else also had their modern style as well, the place almost has a culture of its own. Otherwise, I am super impressed with the ramen. Going to be coming back all the time.

*Its a pain in the bum bum to try to eat here from 11:00-1:00*"}
{"text":"Oh man! First experience here (came with experienced friends ) and had the best ramen of my life!!! 
I'm so happy with everything from service to the meal itself. Great portion and great quality. Just the best SO MUCH YUM"}
{"text":"Hip vibrant millennial place that is rockin when they open the doors for lunch. At the advice of my hipster nephew and wanting an urge for comfort food, I arrived around 11:20 am for lunch knowing from yelpsters that this place fills up fast and one should be prepared for a wait.

Fortunately, I arrived and was able to take the last seat at the eight seat exhibition counter and ordered with their classic Tonkatsu ramen. Since it was my first time, I asked about the quantity and portion size of the pork and was told it was two pieces of average size. Wanting to be on the cautious side since my belly was aching for food, I ordered two additional pieces of pork which was a smart move! Upon arrival, the creamy pork broth was not oily and ingredients blended well together. My wish is that this particular dish would have ingredients that would add more color to the presentation.  In terms of food handling (food safety), this place is above par from other ramen parlors that I have visited so kudos for that.

Overall, not the best that I have but definitely solid ramen for Calgary."}
{"text":"We have three people, but the server gave us a two ppl table, and he even refused to add a seat for us. Don't have any common sense. Ramen is good but bad service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome from food to atmosphere. I cannot recommend it enough. I had the tonkotsu black ramen and char sui pineapple cilantro tacos. The flavors were on point. The music was great and the waitstaff were very helpful with recommending and describing dishes. Will definitely be back here"}
{"text":"Ramen was ok but it was definitely way more hyped up than actually delicious. Have only tried two ramen bowls here though and they were both pretty bland. But may go back and try other bowls and see. service was pretty bad tho, our server was dismissive"}
{"text":"Nothing cures the cold winter weather blues like a steaming bowl of soup. That was what won us over as we battled back and forth on whether we should hit up Shiki for lunch. We'd read a few reviews about the ridiculously long lines and the possibility that they'd be out of ramen by the time we'd arrived (Friday around noon, were we crazy?!) but we stayed hopeful.

My friend dropped me off so I could snag a spot in line while he parked the car, I jotted my name on the waitlist and stood in the crowded doorway with the other potential diners. I'm not gonna lie, when they called my name in less than 15 mins of being there I was really surprised. 

It's quite cosy seating (aka you're THISCLOSE to the table next to you) and the menu is short and sweet (probably helps to ensure a quick turnaround). I went with the chili goma, my friend the kara miso garlic.

I loved the chewy texture of the noodles, perfectly seasoned bits of pork and crunch of the peanuts. I wish I had more room to finish off the broth, it had a nice spiciness to it and flavoured just right.

We settled our bill (FYI they only take cash or debit) and we were outta there in less than an hour, including our wait time. 

I'm glad we stayed optimistic about getting in, we finally got to try some pretty decent ramen in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Excellent Ramen, and gyozas were delicious too.

Music was a little loud for conversation, draft was cold.

The bowls are absolutely huge.
Way more then i could eat for lunch.

Very popular, as we went at 1-115, and still had to wait for a table, but it's not a big floor plan."}
{"text":"Way too long of a wait to be seated. Took me about an hour after arrival and sign in to get in to the place. Food was okay- nothing special about it, though. The bowl is huge, has a lot of soup, but not enough noodles. Not to mention, this place was very, very, loud. I had to shout to a friend sitting no less than two feet in front of me to get any words across.

Something I found odd, they seemed to serve what looked like soft tacos. A bit strange, considering it's supposed to be a ramen place.

Shiki Menya seems like a place for.. hipsters? If you want ramen that's worth the price, I recommend Muku. The bowls are cheaper, and it's nothing fancy. Just good ol' ramen without the hour long wait, and a much quieter noise level (however, there is a wait of about 10-25 minutes)."}
{"text":"Best ramen ever!! 

They have a relatively small menu, focusing on a few dishes. But these few dishes are perfect. The broth is made from scratch, all ingredients seem to be of high quality and mainly local. 
The chili ramen is my favorite so far. If you prefer the miso ramen but want to spice it up a bit, ask for some chili oil, it makes a big difference. Portions are big, you will be pretty full after. The noodles are also made fresh daily and in house, so tasty! Different from the usual rise noodles, in a good way. 

Apparently I am not the only one who thinks this is a great place to grab a bite. They open at 11am. When I first visited this place I showed up at 11am, as this was the only time that my friend could make it, thinking this place will be pretty much empty at this time. Who has lunch at 11am? BUT, when I arrived shortly before 11am (on a weekday) there was a long lineup!  We got some of the last seats. They also have a waiting list outside, every day!!! Mind you, the place is only open from 11 am until they run out of ramen, which is usually in the (early) afternoon, serving about 150 bowls each day. They will post it on twitter when they run out of ramen: @shikimenya 
Closed for dinner and on Sundays, but open on holidays.

The restaurant is not too big, I'd say about 35 seats. You can't make any reservations, hence it's hard to accommodate larger groups. Some free street parking is available right in front, but usually taken. Go into the residential area on the north side of the main road and you will find more free parking, on the south side it seems to be paid parking. 

They don't offer take out, as ramen should be eaten right away, otherwise the noodles get too soggy. Highly recommand going there, although I don't want this place to get even busier, but I also don't want you to miss out on having a mouthgasm."}
{"text":"Amazing! Been dreaming about this place since I last visited. The ramen is amazing, apps, drinks etc all on point. The staff is friendly and the vibe is creative."}
{"text":"I checked this place out before they officially opened. They let their social media followers know that they have are open for \"100 Bowls a day\". 

The Kara Miso was bomb. Being from the mighty Vancouver where Ramen is awesome, I was skeptical. With their fresh and bouncy  in-house noodles and rich hearty broth, I was immediately a fan. 

Check this place out. Best Ramen in town."}
{"text":"Oishi (means delicious in Japanese) Ramen in Cowtown! We came in on Saturday lunch time, due to limited 150 units of noodles made from scratch per day. I ordered Tonkostu Black: negi (green onion), soft tomago (poached egg), menma (noodles), char siu (BBQ pork belly), corn or bamboo shoots, black garlic oil, and squid ink garlic with dash of thin strip slice of crispy seaweed. And my friend ordered char siu garlic mayo rice bowl: BBQ pork belly with house made garlic mayo sauce over the rice. We sat at the open kitchen bar saw the line cooks cooking the noodles in front of me. Kitchen was clean and kind of well-organized structure. From receive the order to cooking the noodles. All the ingredients are prepare before they open the restaurant. It takes about 4 minutes and 30 seconds from drop the noodles into custom made noodle water boiler, pour soup base and main ingredient into a bowl. The soup temperature are high which it qualifies as Japan's ramen standard and time cooking as some Japanese noodle expert friend told me. Shiki Menya will be my new list of Ramen in Calgary. 

Tips:
No Reservation
Recommend came in before 12:30pm due to limited 150 noodle supplies per day.
Cash and Debit payment only. (No credit cards)"}
{"text":"I got in just after it opened today, and grabbed the last table. Like other reviewers have stated, they make enough noodles for 150 bowls of Ramen. They close after the noodles are done. The flavour was good, not over stated. I also had the pork tacos and gyoza. My only complaint about this restaurant, is the size and arrangement of tables. 
Shiki Menya is definitely a place to try Ramen. 
If your in the area, around the lunch hour get their early or be prepared to wait in a lineup."}
{"text":"Beware beware, this place gets really busy really fast. D noodles r top notch level n just keeps drawing u bak to d place after a day."}
{"text":"Shiki Menya is one of Calgary's newest ramen shops, although not a stranger to the city. The owners who brought us Shikiji have opened the Japanese noodle eatery, serving up only 150 ramen bowls a day. Then they close up shop (~3pm or so), leaving unlucky ramen-goers waiting for the next day's batch. I saw how the lines were when I visited Black Pig Bistro for lunch so on our last day in Calgary for the May long weekend, Joe and I were right at those glorious doors at 11:15am. We weren't the only ones! Alongside four other parties, we anxiously waited for Shiki Menya's doors to open.

Seating thirty-or-so, the interior is modern, trendy, and very refreshing with lots of natural light streaming through floor to ceiling windows. Love it! It's no hole-in-the-wall place that's for sure, but the food would suggest otherwise.

Unlike their sister restaurant, Shiki Menya offers a variety of broths and toppings. I am so SO thankful that they think a soft tamago (soft-boiled egg) is a ramen essential. Because it is in my world. No egg = not ramen! They offer your classic bowls: tonkotsu, miso, chili goma, and veggie; and a new school bowls for the first three classics: tonkotsu black, kara miso garlic, and goma mazemen. It's surprising that they don't have a shio or shoyu bowl but with the selection of 7 different bowls and a limited supply each day, it's understandable.

Before we got to the good stuff, the gyoza came out first. At a dollar a piece, it's a pretty good deal. Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, with a spicy chili 

Our big bowls came out in no time and served super hot! Nothing like a hot bowl of ramen for lunch. I ordered the kara miso garlic, knowing that a broth with added garlic chili oil is right up my alley. The broth is simmered for at least 16 hours, giving it a rich depth of flavor. The chili oil? Wooooo, garlic-ky! Definitely different from all the other ramen bowls I've ever had. All other components were outstanding as well: a fatty cut of char siu (I despise lean char siu, like what the heck...), perfectly cooked egg (yolk needs to be barely set!), and fresh hand cut noodles! Chewy with a bit of a bite but perfect.

The miso bowls come with a thicker noodle, as with the mazeman, whereas all other bowls come with a thinner noodle. I don't even know how much thinner you can get. If you look closely, you'll see tiny specks inside the noodle. That's kombu, a type of seaweed, popular in the Hokkaido region of Japan, giving it an additional layer of umami flavor. It's amazing how much love Shiki Menya puts into their noodles and broths!

Joe got the classic miso and added garlic \"ra-yu\" chili oil to it to make it spicy. Essentially, he made it almost into my new school bowl but without corn. His broth wasn't as garlic-ky as mine though even with the addition of the chili oil. Same base though and same noodles. Portions aren't enormous, I nearly finished a bowl myself. For the price ($12-14), some might say it's the portion isn't enough but honestly, the labor it takes to make the broth and noodles are worth every penny.

Awesome space and fantastic ramen! I couldn't ask for more. Maybe I would if I had been to Japan but that's for another time. Somebody needs to bring this over to Edmonton ASAP. We're missing a really good ramen joint here up north! Service was excellent with plenty of staff around. The space filled up within minutes of opening at 11am, so I suggest that if you want to be guaranteed a bowl of 150 that day, come early. Bowls come out quick, we were in and out within the hour. And I love the decor and attention to little details, like the textured edges of their chopsticks to pick up slippery noodles to the bigger, wider bowls for those with thicker noodles. Great touch. If you're in the Bridgeland area, check out Shiki Menya! I most definitely will be back on my next trip into Calgary."}
{"text":"Ate here twice in a span of less than 1 month.  I am very fond of their char siu. On my first visit, I tried the miso garlic which I found impressive. The noodles may drive the price but I was more focused on the broth and char siu. They both got me thinking why other ramen places don't compare. I would suggest adding coat hangers all over the restaurant. Cant exactly leave my jackets on the floor! Will definitely frequent this place more than ever!"}
{"text":"I gave 5 stars but I have to note that I would deduct half a point for the one time the hostess gave our table for 4 away because a family with a baby simply swooped in and literally stole out seats and weren't asked to move. We were left with shrugs from the host and \"well we DO have a child\" from their rude ass parents. I assure you, table stealers, your baby gives way less of a fu*k about ramen and will tip less than I do. Most people would be way more angry and give a one star for that reason alone. The fact remains, however, that if you want to eat here you're going to wait possibly an hour for any group of more than two. Parents who don't use their kid as an excuse to do asshole things, I salute you with a chopstick. 

I like the atmosphere here. Cool tunes and the staff have always been great. My go to is the Chili Goma with Char Sui added. Broth is creamy and seasoned just enough with chili. I hate when I get a soup dish that burns my lips so bad that I can't finish my meal or enjoy the taste. I can handle really spicy foods and enjoyed the balance. The apps are great too, whatever the dumplings are called are delish but come out as hot as a spent uranium rod.  

I get that people can find it pretentious to require your whole party to be available for seating. Only serving 150 bowls a day.  No reservations and a long wait. Cant split the bill. Be prepared for these facts and you'll enjoy the hell out of this place. Luckily there are others options for people looking for ramen. Personally, I really do not care about such things and will continue to be their patron."}
{"text":"A great place for lunch and warming up on those colder days. The soup is rich and flavourful. The portions are generous. Chili goma is a definite treat. Get here about ten minutes before opening to ensure a table is available."}
{"text":"Best ramen in the city. Awesome staff. Hard to get a seat if you're not there at 11am or don't get lucky and show up at the right time. Amazing food and worth waiting for!"}
{"text":"I went with my buddy on a Friday to check out Shiki Menya.  The queue wasn't so bad. You just have to write your name, arrival time, and party size on this form on a clipboard located next to the shared access doors (if you go inside and turn right, you'll end up a the Black Pig Bistro which I intend to try too).

Service was quick.  As soon as we got seated, our drink orders were taken (canned pop is $3!).  From reading an article in Avenue's September 2014 issue and other online reviews, I already knew what to order - their bestseller, the chili goma.

The bowl is HUGE and the presentation was as enticing as the ramen house itself.  After I took my first sip of the broth, which takes them 16 hours to make, I wasn't disappointed at all.  I still felt full, long after lunch was over.

One last thing - they only take cash or debit and 15% is their minimum tip."}
{"text":"I've been wondering WHEN WILL THEY SERVE CHICKEN, BEEF, or FISH? Of course, I LOVE Shiki Menya, but some of my friends who aren't eating pork, they'll be dying to have chicken, beef, or fish... I asked the owner about it, he didn't answer my question. Also, we would like to have extra space to sit and eat instead of sitting and bumps others arms. Kinda annoyed."}
{"text":"Shiki Menya is snugly tucked on the trendy hipster vibed 1st Ave, focused on quality and consistently whipping out house made noodles and a hyped up broth. This was our first stop once we hit up Calgary, and I was beyond excited. With the an intensive process of needing 16+ hours to cook their magical broth, only a limited number of bowls are served throughout the day. The shop opens at 11am and they keep twitter updated as soon as they sell out. 

We arrived around 1:30pm on a saturday and there was still quite a bit of a line up. The restaurant is quite tiny, seating maybe 30 seats at most. The entry is also a shared entrance so you're encouraged to wait outside. There is a piece of paper outside where you're suppose to write down your name and how many of you there are. The hype for the ramen bowls are real, so you're guaranteed to have to suffer for a while before earning a spot for yourself. The wait is worth it though. 

Tonkotsu Classic - ($13) - 5/5 - I always go for the classic every time I try out a new ramen place, you really get to taste the broth and the depth of the flavor. With that said, the broth was bomb. Crazy rich and creamy with an instant umami flavor as soon as you take your first slurp. Each bowl has all the typical toppings but the char siu is what stood out the most. First place where the pork goes through an extra step of adding char, to it to give it so much more of a savory aspect. 

Miso Classic - ($13) - 5/5 - My dining partner finished his bowl almost immediately as it was placed in front of us with barely a word or a breath in between each slurp. Assuming this was just as good! 

Char Siu Kimchi Tacos - ($7) - 5/5 - Came with two tacos, served on 2 tortillas. This was heavy considering how we ate this after finishing the massive bowls of ramen but the spice of the kimchi mixed with the heavenly slices of char siu was impeccable. 

The atmosphere itself is very trendy and modern, with a crowd to match. Service was a bit 'touch and go' but that's understandable considering how busy it was. 

Might not be the most authentic type of ramen bowls you'd get from a traditional Japanese eatery, but Shiki adds a great fusion twist to it and the results are flawless and delicious. 100% recommend, will visit again!"}
{"text":"Ramen's soup is generally salty but not today, not here. Soup is just right. I had the kara misu garlic and it was a smooth, creamy broth (not creamy literally but tasted that way). Very rich and heavy. While the broth is orangy in colour suggesting spiciness, it wasn't spicy (well, at least not to me). My friends had the tonkotsu classic which was a lighter broth but still tasty. What I loved best was the char siu. SOOO GOOOOD. It was lightly grilled and you can see the grill marks on one side. Very fatty cut of meat but so delicious. My only complaint is there were only two slices (albeit thick) of char siu to go with the over-sized bowl of ramen. The egg is soft and still runny - the way I like it but I can't say it was anything special or the best I've had. Servings come in very large bowls with large wooden spoons (almost like a small ladle) - it's makes it easy and difficult to eat at the same time...can't fit the whole spoon in your mouth so you end up trying to suck up the food from one side of the spoon but I'm glad there is a large soup spoon to scoop up all that goodness. The noodles were not your usual that resembles instant ramen noodles- this was more like a thick greyish-yellowish spaghetti strand that's a little hard. Very filling. The place is pretty small but we went on a Tues at noon and waited maybe 10 mins before we were seated. Decor is not traditional Asian style - looks modern and Westernized. There are some bar seats and some tables."}
{"text":"Food was a four star. Ramen is the perfect trifecta between soup, noodles, and cha siu. Pretty good, broth was flavourful, noodles are home made and the right texture, toppings were nice and egg was cooked perfectly. Too bad the pork was only alright, flavor and texture just off from a trifecta!

Is it just me or this place seems a little pretentious... Oh we only serve lunch, no dinner. We only do 150 bowls a day... Here are all the rules at the front door. Your whole party has to be here, you have to buy at least one bowl, you can't split the bill, you can't wait in the lobby because the restaurant next door is going to open except it never did Saturday morning? -1 star."}
{"text":"It's amazing.  It oozes with love and appreciation.  

The staff seem to love life and happy from inside out.  It shows in the food and know how much goes into ramen. I love that it is stripped down and is what it is.  And we all know we are getting something special that day.  It is the best ramen I've ever had."}
{"text":"Best ramen in town - very tasty soup.  Love the taco.  Good service.  Hours sucks - should open on Sunday.  Love that you can tweet to make sure they have some left if you are coming late in the day - since they only make 150 bowls a day."}
{"text":"Ramen noodles were freshly made so every bowl comes out a bit different. The broth was really good and you can request extra items in your bowl. I also suggest ordering the matsukaze green tea. It had a nice refreshing taste and was perfect on the hot summer day! Be prepared to wait in line to get in though as this is a hot spot. We got here around 12 and waited about 30 minutes to be seated. It's a pretty small place but clean with emotionally friendly staff.  They don't have a waiting room inside but there was plenty of seating right outside the restaurant. Not sure how it'll be come winter."}
{"text":"I finally got around to writing a review of this place.  We went there for lunch during a weekday and thankfully we arrived early enough to get seats without waiting.  The people that came right after us wasn't so lucky.  The food was decent.  I had the Goma Mazemen.  The ramen was good in terms of texture but it was on the salty side for me.  The service was neither good or bad.  I sometimes write reviews a few weeks or even months after my visits.  The expectional restaurants would leave clear impressions on me even after a lengthy.  However, this place isn't one of them as it really didn't leave any impression on me.  Oh wait, the whatever limited number of bowls of ramen served per day left a gimicky impression on me.  On another visit of the area on a weekend, there were something like 40-50 people waiting outside to get in... a bit ridiculous to me... so be prepared to wait a long time if you wanna try this place out on the weekend."}
{"text":"Great ramen! Would go there again anytime! If you are planning to go be sure to get there 15 minutes before they open because it fills up quickly."}
{"text":"The best ramen in Calgary. PERIOD. I am a fan of classic tonkatsu, and think it is a consistent dish by which all ramen places may be compared. Their Tonkatsu is everything it should be and doesn't bother trying to be hip or new just for the sake of it. Don't mess with what works, right? Their other bowls and appetizers are also very good. The only downsides are hours and parking. Try to show up at 11 am to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"This is the closest ramen I've found to the quality and taste you get in Japan. Made fresh daily, they have a limited amount of daily bowls, so you have to go early. The Chili Goma is my shit! It is just bursting with flavour!"}
{"text":"In preparation for my trip to Japan, girlie suggested this popular spot. We got there 35 minutes before it opened as per her recommendation. Already a line up. Apparently the place only makes a certain amount of ramen per day. Once they run out, they close.
I had the 'tonkotsu black' The ramen noodles were terrific. The broth was very interesting and packed with ingredients such as bamboo shoots and corn. This one had squid ink too. Very intrigued. 
The service was good, and the place remained packed with a lineup outside as we left."}
{"text":"Solid solid bowl of Ramen. After hearing about this place because of twitter, decided to check it out for myself. Went on their first week of opening and was pleasantly surprised. Ordered up the classic tonkatsu ramen and was greeted by a large bowl of soup.

 The extra layer of fat on top of the broth ensures the soup stays at the proper temperature. Great ramen feeeexins and tasty noodles. (Although these noodles are very different than what I've had in Tokyo) 

Friendly service and a great new ramen spot. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I like the premise behind Shiki Menya, they make their noodles fresh everyday and once their out then it's done, no more ramen for the day. You can get updates on Twitter if you want to know when they're sold out and how the line is. I took advantage of being off during the week to come for 11:00 AM, opening. There was already quite the line of people but we got a table with the first wave. We both had the tonkotsu black which was delicious, the meat is perfectly smokey and the noodles have a great texture and chew to them. Service is really quick and because there's a line outside you don't feel like you can linger long after finishing so it tends to go quite quickly."}
{"text":"The place is funky, quite hipsterish--feels very young. The ramen itself was mediocre. The noodles had no elasticity, the tonkatsu broth was watery and lacked umami. The garlic miso ramen was better, but far too salty--both me and my sister failed to finish even half our bowls. Gyoza was unremarkable, but the chasu was surprisingly delicious--but that's probably the only high point in our entire experience. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Dining at Shiki Menya is like the DragonBall Z arc where Goku powered up the spirit bomb for like 10 episodes to defeat the evil Frieza (spoiler alert: Frieza lives). The wait is STUPIDLY long and the meal barely satisfies. The gimmicky hype of a limited noodle supply and so-so food has deterred me from going back since I tried them on their opening week in 2013...until 2 days ago. 

At the time, I suspected the broth was watered down to meet unexpected high demand. It was bland. Fast forward 3 years later, it is now creamy and rich, but, sadly, very salty. Their homemade noodles are fresh and tasty. 

What was most disappointing is the char siu tacos are now filled with a saucy pulled pork concoction most likely to cut costs since the cut of meat is cheaper. They were once filled with slices of grilled char siu, the same stuff on their ramen. The smokey, charred flavors worked well with the sweet pineapple salsa. The current recipe doesn't remotely live up to it's predecessor. 

I'm glad they've improved, but the fact that the wait for a table was longer than my only-ok meal won't help Shiki Menya get to Super Saiyan mode anytime soon. Keep training, Shiki-chan."}
{"text":"I am sure this is not going to be a very popular review but I finally decided to write it and get over it. 

After hearing a lot bout this place, we finally decided to try this place for a Saturday lunch, we were there 15 minutes after opening and realized there is 40 minutes wait which was expected after reading the reviews. So after 50 minutes we entered the restaurant with ultra high expectations. we ordered the black garlic ramen and some soya beans. 

We were sitting at the bar with a clear view of the open kitchen. It was a lot of fun watching them cook our meal. So if you have the option, I highly recommend the bar sitting.

The food arrived fast and hot. However, to be honest it was a good bowl of ramen and nothing more. I was expecting something similar to David Chang Momofuku but it was not even close. Defiantly not worth the wait and hassle. Please do not take me wrong, it is still good ramen but nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Food are very good here. Ramen was deciduous. Soup base was thick and tasty. Overall the bowl looked very delicate and tempting. $14 for the ramen well spent. 
One star down for the service. We went there on a Saturday at 1:45 pm and it was packed with people waiting outside. It's my first time here and no waiter bothered to let us know about the sign-in wait list at the door. Later i was told to wait for 20 mins (30 in reality). Fine, I don't mind waiting. Then we're told by a waiter to seat with 6 other strangers on the same shared table, fine, we don't mind sitting with strangers and listening to their lunch talks while they could listen to ours. After we ordered and another waiter bring a bowl to our table he announced this is a bowl for our table, but don't know who or which group ordered it. When my wife asked him is it her order or ramen, he simply put the bowl with her and said: I don't know; I didn't take your order. In such a way that it is as if her fault for not knowing what her dish will look like. Not cool! 
In the end a waiter bring our bill and told us cash or debit only. How convenient. I got my debit card ready but waited for another 5-10 minutes for another waiter to drop by and bring us a machine. The default tips are 18%, 20% and 22%. SORRY I DON'T FEEL LIKE TIPPING 18% AFTER WAITED, SHARED TABLE, AND BEING TREATED LIKE THIS BY THE WAITERS. 
I consider good customer service as an important part to an entire dinning experience package. Top notch ramen here and decent price, but knowing at least 2 other comparable ramen restaurants in Calgary with top notch customer services, I don't think I will be back at Shiki Menya in one year time."}
{"text":"Trust the hype and jump in line and slurp those noodles like there is no tomorrow. Their broth is the bomb; no question. The gyoza could use some more grilling time and the egg could use a little more time in a shoyu bath, in my opinion. I only hope they extend their hours a bit. At least to Sundays; come on!"}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to eat at the most popular ramen place in town. We looked at the lineup with people waiting on the sidewalk: it reminded me of Vancouver. We put our name on the waiting list: it reminded me of Vancouver. We waited for an hour on a Saturday: it reminded me of Vancouver. We shared a table with other customers in this cozy restaurant: it reminded me of Vancouver.

I ordered the Kara Miso Garlic with extra ramen which was a pretty spicy dish. The good kind of spice that is also flavorful. The housemade noodles were cooked al dente which is typical in any good ramen shops. They were a little thicker than other ramen shops that I've tried in the past. The broth was slightly thick but also slightly more salty than I liked it to be. Still very good though. I really liked the pork (char siu) which I think was charbroiled. The meat was tender and it had some char taste to it, which fits my personal preference.

I've been to 2 of the big 3 ramen shops on Robson in Vancouver and while I prefer them over Shiki Menya, the food here was still very good. The broth was very tasty but not as flavorful as the ones on Robson. I also prefer the noodles in the other 2 places as well. I haven't tried many ramen places in Calgary but it's likely that Shiki Menya is the best in the city based on what I'm hearing. Definitely a place worth going back."}
{"text":"Shiki Menya still has lineups out the door. I continue to be mind blown. Hipsters like their ramen eh?

There's a list out front so make sure you sign up pronto. We just missed the first seating so we had to wait inside and peer at all the people getting their food first.

- Chili goma ($14.00) - you'd think it would be bursting with flavour with all that chill oil and dried chili. Nope. I think I prefer the chili goma at Shikiji. That being said, their homemade noodles have a good bite and firmness to them that holds up in the soup.
- Veggie classic ($14.00) with two soft tamago ($1.00 each) - S's normal order involves 2-5 tamago. Glad to see he's toned it down and only needs two now. Haha.
- Tonkotsu classic ($13.00) - Ok's bowl. She always orders extra char sit ($3.00). I've had this one before and think this might be my favourite from the ones I've tried so far. Broth is rich, creamy and the char siu is grilled for extra flavour.

Shiki Menya doesn't blow me away but it's good in it's own way. If you're willing to wait. Either go early when it first opens or much later. Don't forget cash and debit only."}
{"text":"Gosh I've been here so many times and haven't yet left a review??? What is wrong with me?

If it's your first time eating here just get the Tonkatsu Classic right off the bat. My first time I got the squid ink and regretted it. It seems the more I eat here the more I love it!! We don't bother with the sides anymore. The char sui tacos are just way too salty. I also wished they served hot green tea rather than their iced green tea. Nothing worse than ruining perfectly good brewed tea by making it cold. Ugh!! If you're feeling extra hungry you can add on extra noodles, extra egg, extra veggies, and/or extra char sui (of course paying an extreme premium should you add all of the above!) My picky kids polish a whole shared bowl to themselves. Lately I've been getting extra noodles and that seems to suffice. Their broth along with the noodles can be quite filling. 

What I dislike is the wait, but it's to be expected when it's a tiny venue with limited seating and a bunch of people in the know waiting as well. They do it like they do in Japan where you put your name down on a list and wait to be called. They do try to be efficient and on their menu they do ask discreetly for patrons to eat and get out! It's a terrible wait in the winter time especially when you're a keener who gets there at 10:45am waiting for the door to open so you can get in the first seating. Brrrr!! And oh yes, you may want to bring ear plugs because they tend to play their music as loud as a night club. The last few visits haven't seemed as loud; perhaps there have been complaints?!? If you're at any of the corner tables where the speaker is directly above, forget about having any type of conversation unless you're willing to scream. Even the servers have a hard time taking your order. 

It's a must try ramen joint in Calgary! I've been to so many and have yet to find another that appeals to me the same way. I can't say it's better than the one joint we raved about in Harajuku, Tokyo but it is darn close!!!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for a while and finally got an opportunity to swing by before lunch rush to avoid the lineups.  I ordered the Karo Miso Garlic ramen.

The noodles were great, perfect bite and perfectly slurpable.  The soup was a tad salty, with a strong garlic taste which I enjoyed, however it was much spicier than I anticipated and I couldn't drink all of the broth.  The pork was perfectly tender and the sweet nuggets of corn offered a good contrast.  

Definitely one of the better ramen shops in Calgary, get here before the lineups though."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen, if you can get some before its sold out! Have had nearly every dish and all are seriously outstanding! The only downside is sometimes they run out."}
{"text":"Everything at Skiki Menya is outstanding.  The ramen, the service, the menu options (but not the line up but get over it, put your smart phone away and have an actual conversation with your friends).

When I leave this restaurant I walk away already craving my next bowl of ramen.  Sure the hours are limited but they only cook enough soup to serve a limited number of bowls so take that as a good thing, if you want better hours you will have to settle for canned soup stock at a cheaper restaurant."}
{"text":"Going to say this upfront - you guys need to get better hours. I get it that its \"trendy\" or whatever to get people to fight to the death for tables or something but if people need to pay for parking just to stand in line for 40 minutes that's annoying. Especially in minus 30 degree weather. So when YELP asks me if this place is good for groups I would give that a resounding NO.

ALSO one of the servers dropped a tray of water glasses and splashed me and when I got home I found a piece of glass in my boot. So please be more careful and please clean up accidents better.

Other than that my experience here was phenomenal, so 4/5 it is. We waited about 30 minutes overall for a table so I am glad the experience was worth the extra effort to eat here. You go in and sign up at the door and they seat you based on first come first serve. The interior is trendy. I had to do a double take on the Wu-tang symbol on the bathroom doors and I thought that was kind of cool. I personally don't mind sitting next to strangers, because I like to creep on people's food.

I got the garlic miso ramen and it was amazing. I ate every bite like the little piglet I am (and some of my girlfriends). I got tofu added and I'm glad I did because it was good and I like tofu. Noodles were cooked well and the pork was literally so tender. It was so delicious. We also had gyoza which was standard but not as phenomenal as the ramen. Our gyoza was also accidentally brought to another table before us so we didn't get it as an appetizer but it was OK we are not too concerned about it. We ended up getting it about 10 minutes after we got the ramen.

Service is good and staff are friendly. Lots of hipster dudes everywhere. Good music. I will definitely be back to this place when I come back to Cowtown."}
{"text":"Still craving chili goma and not sure when I'll get to go back! For all the hype and fuss, this place delivers.

The broth is nutty, creamy and will have you spooning every last bit into your mouth. The pork is ground but perfectly salty and so flavorful.

The fresh mustard green cuts through the richness of everything else and the black sesame seeds adds a nice crunch.

The wait was minor and the service efficient and pleasant. Whenever I'm back in the neighborhood and not fighting against the clock, I can't wait to come back and enjoy this sinfully perfect ramen."}
{"text":"Had the tonkatsu Classic and tacos.  Both were very good.  Gotta get there early.  Was there at 11 which is when it opens.  It was even a holiday (thanksgiving) which I thought would make it less busy but there was already a line out the door."}
{"text":"Ok when a restaurant has all this hype with lineups and such,  who doesn't want to check it out! Great job social media and word of mouth! 
Reading reviews I knew we had to be there early to get in. So we arrived at 1030am and there were already almost 30 people ahead of us on a Saturday! Guess we all wanted it for breakfast! Public Service  Announcement: if you're going to smoke in a line, at least stand away from the cue so people won't choke on your second hand smoke.
Doors opened exactly at 11am and sadly we didn't make the first cut. Alas another 20mins wait. 
Finally we got in and every seat was taken. If you're not a fan of hightop chairs or bank seating with your back to the window, then you probably won't enjoy their seating. 
Menu was simple and we knew we wanted the garlic goma and chili goma. Also ordered gyoza to share. Everything came out nice and fast and looked AWESOME!  Flavours were tasty and the noodles were so fresh.
I'd say my only criticism was the loud old school rap playing directly above our head. We mentioned to the server who turned it down then another serve went back to turn it up. A bit frustrating when you're trying to have a conversation. 
Additionally, they only take cash or debit.
When the hype starts to die down, we wil return."}
{"text":"Best bowl of ramen I've had in Alberta to satisfy the craving after living abroad in Asia."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance and design here. Sleek and modern. Drake, Vince Staples, and Migos playing in the background. WWE references on the menu. It's hella hip and if Biggie and Tupac were still alive, they'd probably eat here.

But let's talk about economics, ya'll. 

They only make 150 bowls a day, and if you come after they serve the last bowl, you're out of luck. So you better come early, right? That's what everyone else is doing, at least.

Well, hold on there. Something doesn't add up. If this place is so trendy and popular, why wouldn't they just... make... more... bowls? Like 200? Or 250? Don't they WANT to make more money? Do they not have enough space in their pantry to store a few more noodles? 

I don't get it. Sounds like a marketing thing to me.

Anyway, the ramen craze has been spreading worldwide and it seems like Calgary is no exception. I'm from Houston (in the other cowboy state, Texas) and we have plenty of ramen down here as well. Honestly, the ramen at Shiki Menya is just aight. 

I went with the Tonkatsu Classic and there really wasn't anything above average about it. Broth was okay. Chashu slices were smaller than average. Egg was just a regular softboiled egg, with no additional flavor. And there was LETTUCE. Why is there lettuce in my ramen? Do they even have lettuce in Japan?! Maybe Shiki Menya is trying to put a new spin on it, which I respect, but this one didn't work well. Texture-wise, in a bowl of noodles, I'm looking for something more chewy than crispy.

Also they don't take credit card, which is a major bummer. Cool spot though."}
{"text":"This small little shop is a great place for ramen. They only serve a limited number of bowls per day so you will need to get there early or risk not getting in. 

The food here is amazing. They take the time and effort to make their broth. No matter which bowl you order, the broth is bursting with umami flavour. The noodles are made fresh in house and have a great texture. I had the tonkatsu black which is loaded with garlic and a touch of squid ink. The pork belly in the soup was so tender. 

Another favourite of mine is the chili goma. Less broth but very flavourful. It's got a hint of spice with the amazing flavour of peanuts and cashews. 

You do need to try the char siu tacos (pork belly). They are very tender and an amazing take on Mexican-Japanese fusion. 

If your only experience with ramen is ichiban, try this out and you will never look at instant ramen the same again!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Shiki Menya and we were quite excited from all the raving reviews people gave the restaurant.

We(my brother, hubby, and myself)arrived around 11am and did not get seated until 1:10pm. Around 12:45 I asked my hubby to check the list and he found out that our name was crossed off, but we weren't called at all(and we knew when names were called as we were seated by the restaurant door). There were also 2 other groups that had their names crossed off without being called. We spoke with the staff that was keeping track of the line/list and he denied that he didn't call us, but multiple people confirmed that we didn't hear our names. He wasn't apologetic at all and made this annoyed face every time he came back out to call customers in.

I would really give the restaurant 5 stars as the food and service in the restaurant was superb. But the first staff we met really put us in a bad mood. We were prepared for a long wait as we read the reviews, but we would have waited without being seated at all if it was up to that staff member.

Anyway, we ordered 2 tonkotsu classics, and the spicy miso(totally forgot the name). Both broths were flavorful, but not oily. The noodles were perfectly chewy and tasted really fresh. The egg, meat, and veggie toppings were the icing on the cake. Everything came together to make the perfect ramen bowl. 

We will definitely come back again, but will be there around 10:30am and will keep a close watch on the list. Definitely recommending Shiki Menya to friends and family. And will be bringing a bigger group next time as well."}
{"text":"First time here and I will most definitely be back! I have almost recovered from my goma coma (so dubbed by the gentleman behind the bar) and will try and fight through the haze to leave a detailed review. 

We arrived at about 11:10am. The first seating had already taken place at opening (11am) and about 13 new groups has already signed up.  We walked to get a coffee and made it in after about an hour wait. We sat at the bar... not always the most comfortable spot, very cozy, but definitely the most interesting seats for foodies! 

The decor is simple and the place isn't overly cramped. The atmosphere at the bar was nice and the kitchen staff are super friendly :D I'm not sure what music was playing as I was far too distracted by the food I was watching being made... \"oooh that looks good, let's get that..... oooh that looks good too!.... aaawwww I want everything!\" 

In the end, I ordered the chili goma ramen, my other half ordered the kari... black garlic? Can't remember the exact name but it was garlicky and delicious. We also ordered the char siu musubi. 

My chili goma ramen was ridiculous.... and by ridiculous I mean awesome! The homemade noodles were well cooked with some chew and had great flavour and texture. The pork was very well spiced and the goma flavour blended beautifully with the deep, creamy broth. I also added menma  (bamboo shoots) which I liked in the dish. Nice presentation and a big portion!

I only tried the broth of Jay's ramen  and it was fabulous... again the ingredients had melded very well together into a deep complex broth that had layers of flavour. The musubi was also delicious! I admit I was a bit skeptical at first... I thought it looked like too much rice and mayo, but when I wrapped it up and took a bite, the proportion of ingredients worked really well! Very tasty starter. 

As we chatted with the gentleman working in front of us, we had a great conversation about ramen and Japanese cuisine. I immediately started drooling again thinking about all the delicious food I ate in Japan! He was kind enough to make a number of other ramen recommendations which I very much appreciate! He also gave us some gyoza on the house and they were delicious! Lots of filling... the only warning I would give is to not douse the gyoza in the sauce they provide. It's good but very salty.

Overall, great service, great food, and good people! I'm excited to come back and try their other bowls... although I think I'll get there before 11am next time! Hats off to Aihara-san, the chef from Japan! Arigatou gozaimasu! Totemo oishikatta!"}
{"text":"Such rich flavours in the broth. Take a sealed container because you will want to take the leftovers home. Noisy."}
{"text":"Where has this place been all my life! I attempted to come here once a while back but the line up was crazy (on like Thursday??) so I decided to go else where. But today was the day I'd give it another go. And OH MY GOD I am so happy that day has finally come. We came there just after noon and we did have to wait a bit as the place was full. It's not an overly large place, so I can see it getting full and busy really quick. I did some yelping beforehand to see what other people picked off the menu and to take a look at the photos. The kara garlic miso instantly grabbed my attention. 

I like garlic, I like miso, I like chili oil, it was an obvious choice of what I would pick. Those three flavours married one another and had a beautiful ramen baby. The noodles were on the thicker side, which is something I'm not usuaully crazy over, but you can just tell that they were fresh and made that day, which just made it all the more better. The char siu (aka pork) was incredibly flavourful and tender. You can tell the other toppings were also of quality. If you don't get particularly my dish and you're looking to kick up the flavour a bit with some spice, get the garlic chili oil on the side to mix in, which is something my friend did with the tonkostu classic. It honestly just makes a world of a difference. 

I love just overall the general vibe of the place. The staff are mostly young, hipster lookin guys who I think just give the place a really cool feel. They have an open concept kitchen which I like because you can watch your food being prepared and watch all the staff busy at work. Great place!! Get their a little early, because they make their noodles fresh everyday, they close once they sell out!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The wait was long...but there were 16 groups ahead of us on their list. The staff were friendly and moved as quickly as they could get people in and out without rushing diners, so the wait was only about 45 minutes. Not really that bad considering how many were ahead of us, and it's a fairly small venue. The only downside was that they had no highchairs, so it made dining with my one year old rather adventurous. But the taste of the perfectly seasoned ground pork and noodles mixed into the deliciously creamy broth was worth it! We went for lunch on a Friday, arriving at 11:45am...I recommend either lining up before they open or going later around 1 - they open at 11 - and arriving after the lunch rush. By the time we were seated and finished dining, there was still a stream of people but not crowds."}
{"text":"Delicious chili goma. Seating for about 30 if waiting in line for them to open. Second seating starts at 1120-1125."}
{"text":"Really yummy I had the tonkotsu black. I've been wanting to try there forever but the line up usually steers me away. We went on a Monday and got in right away.  I'm glad I finally did. I would go back in a heartbeat. If you like ramen make sure you check it out."}
