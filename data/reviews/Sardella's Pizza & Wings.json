{"text":"This was my first experience with Sardella's and it was incredibly disappointing. Ordered the Pomodoro pizza, spicy bbq wings, and honey bbq wings. All were painfully mediocre. I ordered from this location mostly of the lack of good pizza in the area, and wanted something that wasn't Pizza Hut or Dominos. Big mistake. Pizza was bland, wings were typical frozen wings with bbq sauce, blah blah. It was bad. Don't bother. Even Pizza Hut is better which is saying a lot."}
{"text":"We ordered spaghetti with meat balls and also spaghetti with chicken Parm along with a few garlic knots.  When we picked it up, it was packed well and very hot when we got it home!

The price was lower than most in the area, a good value for your money.  They were very well organized and had the order ready in less than a minute when we arrived to pick it up.  Packed well, ready to go when promised and delicious.  What more could one want???  A great first experience with them!"}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings around!! And great customer service. Have visited all 4 locations and have been pleased with all!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots. Perfect ratio of cheese lite sauce fresh ingredients. Their wings are always crispy and sauces perfect. My favorite is the gold sauce. And for the longest time u always got a free cookie!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for many many years and their pizza is always amazing!!! Friendly staff that even offers your kids dough to play with as you are waiting for your food!! If you have not been here I definitely recommend for you to check them out!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a kid.  Their pizza is THE best. You should try their traditional wing sauce."}
{"text":"The pizza was not bad ! It is very greasy!They did give us garlic knots on the house which was very nice. When we sat down the table was dirty ! Can't say it the best but not too bad!"}
{"text":"We called for pick up and ordered a lg pizza wings and bread sticks. We had to repeat our Order three times over the phone. Once we picked up our order the forgot our extra ranch that we paid for and all of our food was cold. The pizza seemed reheated and the bread sticks were cold and hard. We will never come back to this place. The one in north Phoenix is much better."}
{"text":"Pizza is \"ok\" nothing to rave about unless your a bread lover.I eat from here at least once a week ( work buys us pizza and wings) wings never have that crisp
they're ALWAYS soggy an barley cooked all the way. But hey see for yourself !"}
{"text":"Always courteous when answering the phone.  Very pleased!  Will keep ordering again.  The cookies are a plus!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza/wing combo.  I expected the mushrooms to be fresh.....from the garden....not the CAN.  I ordered the wings crispy....they were not....I don't understand why this would have been a problem... Next time I will call in my order instead of ordering online....maybe a verbal request will be easier to get  across to them.  I had two orders of wings and when prompted on the online order form to choose the dressings I chose the ranch.  I made the mistake of thinking \"two orders must mean two containers of dressing\". Nope only one dressing.  Wish I would've known...I would've paid the extra for one more container in order to have enough."}
{"text":"Yelp won't allow negative stars or no stars it's one star by default.   I wanted to order 40 wings...and a pizza...the special at 33.95 plus tax delivery and tip...around a $40 expenditure...then came the deal breaker....order 5 wings you get one dressing ...order 20 wings you get one dressing...so for a party with 40 wings I get two dressings...what about the other 30 wings people????? Hope nobody likes dressing?  To get barely enough dressing I would have to pay an additional $3 plus tax....I guess their \"line\" to people is \"you should keep an extra bottle of dressing around\" Really??? Let's see if I get a response from management.....\"sorry about your negative experience, please come back and give us a second chance\".  This is the only place I know of that gives the same amount of dressing for one wing as they do twenty wings...."}
{"text":"We always get the pizza and wings when visiting this establishment.  Great wings and crispy pizza.  When your here try the pizza fries, they are awesome"}
{"text":"Every time I come back to Phoenix I have to eat here at least once.  I lived in Phoenix for 25 years before moving to Colorado and these wings are what I miss most!!  Wongs wings are good too, but Sardella's pizza and wings can't be beat!!"}
{"text":"We were in town for the holidays and wanted delivery to our hotel. We didn't want the run of the mill pizza from the big 2 brands. This place has great pizza and at a great price. They added a coupon code for us without us asking to get us a discount. Keep up the great work. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I cant say enough great things about this place. I havent tasted many if any pizzas that come close to this place. After your done you dont feel like you have a bowl of grease in your gut. Its so full of flavor and fresh ingredients that you just feel satisfied. And its so stringy when you pull the slices apart. Top quality all around. Incredible place, you have to try."}
{"text":"Try the Pomodoro - tomato, basil, garlic, ricotta, and Italian spices.  It's quite good!

We grabbed a pizza from here last Monday - ALL pizzas (including the specialty ones) are half off on Mondays.  That's a terrific deal, so we got a piping hot Medium Pomodoro for less than $5 after tax - yeah, less than I would pay for a frozen DiGiornio's cheese pizza at Fry's around the corner.  

If you're going to use this deal, be aware that your order needs to be over $10 to order online, and they don't process credit cards on their website for pickup orders.  They tell you both of these important pieces of information at the VERY LAST stage in the ordering process.  Oops.  

So just call 20 minutes ahead of time, pick it up, and enjoy that rare gem - cheap, delicious pizza."}
{"text":"I'm a jersey girl and I love pizza- but not this pizza. It was awful and very doughy. It tasted like a frozen pizza from the supermarket. The lady behind the counter was nice enough but I should've known something was up when we were the only ones in there on a Saturday night for pick up. Sorry, we will not be coming back. The search for good NY style pizza in the desert continues...."}
{"text":"Had pizza with family and it was good!! I will come back for a Sunday football with my boys here.."}
{"text":"They make a mediocre pizza at best and they charge a premium price. The options available, in this same area, will give you and your family more pizza, better pizza, for a more reasonable price."}
{"text":"Totally enjoyable experience from beginning to end. Gentleman I spoke to on the phone was so friendly. Truly a pleasure to talk to. Sicilian pizza is to die for. Delivery quick and pizza hot! Delivery person friendly and courteous. Couldn't ask for more! Thank you."}
{"text":"The absolute best pizza in Arizona in my opinion. My boyfriend and I love treating ourselves to some Sardellas pizza. Everyone here is always so nice and friendly whenever we go in to pick up our delicious pizza. This is the only pizza we spend our money on."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!! I have found my new favorite pizza place! I'm new to Phoenix and had gotten a coupon for a free medium one topping pizza in the mail and decided I try it out the other day. Not really expecting much being a free pizza I brought it home and saw the most generous amount of black olives and that alone was enough to make me say I will be back. The pizza was the perfect. Usually I'm not to excited about the crust but this crust was the best crust I have ever eaten. I can't even explain why, it's just so delicious! I may have eaten the whole pizza in one sitting....  I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Pomodoro pizza, it was very, very bland. Instead of a pizza it was more like bread with cheese on it. They used so little sauce that at first I literally thought they forgot to add it or that it didn't come with sauce for some reason. It was honestly tasted like a flat piece of bread with cheese on it : /

Calzone was average, wings were great.

I ordered this from the one on Lake Pleasant Parkway by the way."}
{"text":"The Best Pizza, Wings and prices. I love the atmosphere and all the nice employees at all of their locations. My family loves this place!"}
{"text":"Really great food recommend by hotel- embassy suits north- fast affordable and the spaghetti and meatballs dinner meal could feed a small army!"}
{"text":"I wanted to thank Sardellas for catering our graduation party. The entire experience was easy and without stress as they took care of everything. Ordering the food was made simple by Garrett's patience and suggestions. The food was delivered exactly on time and was expertly arranged. The food was a great hit with everyone. Thank you to every Sardellas."}
{"text":"I've always liked Sardella's and they just won me again. Their crust is the best, as are their prices. I ordered online, and picked up my pizza without looking at it before driving back home. I know. My bad. It was not what I ordered. I called and they remade it and when I got there they let me keep both pizzas! Good pizza with good prices? I'm sold!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and nice menu selection. The marinara here is what makes the difference for me: not too sweet, not too spicy, right combo of garlic and olive oil. Portion sizes are good for the price, quality ingredients and consistent every time I order. Keep it up Sardellas, been a staple for me going on a decade now. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I use these guys for delivery, OK on prices but I gotta say I have experienced some sticker shock on occasion. My favorite thing? Believe it or not, the salads are pretty decent, although you could get more for your $$. Pizza? Eh! Just OK... Wings? Don't go by me, I'm a thigh man."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of sardellas...over-priced pizza with a mediocre taste. But my boyfriend went there all the time growing up so, in his eyes, they could do no wrong. 

Until tonight!

First of all, we got one of the pizza and wings combos and they wouldn't let us get boneless wings instead of traditional. A little inconvenient, but fine. So we got the combo and a small side of boneless wings for me. 

Then the waitress brought out our pizza and told us our wings would be right out. We waited for 15 more minutes only to have a family who came in after us get their wings and ours! When my boyfriend tried to explain that to the waitress she didn't believe him and just took them back to the kitchen then brought them back out to us a minute later...minus my boneless wings. 

Finally, I went up to the counter to get an ETA on my wings and they hadn't even started them yet. I just decided to ask to cancel the order and ask for our money back. The manager obliged, but there was no apology for the poor service. The delayed service really wouldn't bother me if they had been busy, but there were two other families in there other than us. So really, there's no excuse. 

In summation, this place is not worth the hassle. Even the boyfriend said he'd never go back. Go somewhere tried and true to spend your dough."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, our favorite pizza place.  Never tried the pasta or wings so can't comment on that, but the pizza is fabulous, and even more so on Monday at half price.  We generally get a couple of large pizzas whenever we go in, as we live so far away, and we take home what's left after a meal and freeze it.  It's just as wonderful reheated.  We always take our out-of-town company up there too."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Sardellas since the early 90's and up until the last couple years they have been the best pizza in town. We used to go to the one on Cactus then we moved and were so excited when Sardellas moved up to lake pleasant and 83rd. they  have always been very family oriented. Everytime we went there whether it was for a special or just a regualr day their pizza was big and crust was thick and the wings were big, thick and juicy. We always liked ours a little more crisy and they always did that with no problem and both of them were always made to perfection.
Recently however, we have been very disappointed in both. Whenever they seem to have any type of special with their pizzas, the pizza comes out small, crust is terrible and usually burnt. We have understood that they get busy but they have defunately lost their touch. A few times now we have ordered the ultmate and the wings are small and hardly have any meat to them. and forget asking them to make them a little crispier.
on 2 different occasions now we have ordered the ultimate and we had a coupon that was just sent out within the last month of trying to use it and it did not have a exp date on it but another coupon on same pg did and it was at a later date. upon ordering, they said that it was an old coupon and no longer offer that price and would not honor. (mind you it was only $2difference in price) both times they said finally they would take it but the first time my husband went and didn't realize that they didn't give him the discount, the 2nd time i went and saw that the discount wasn't given. i spoke with mgr and she said she wouldn't honor that it was old, i showed her the coupon that said didn't exp till later, she said we change prices all the time. I said you change prices that frequent? within the month you send coupons out.  in the end she was very rude and said will do this time but never again and she was going to mark my file. When I looked at our pizza it was burnt and crust was small, pieces weren't even cut all the way and wings were terrible. Very disappointed. Good family business got too big and don't care about customers anymore. she sat an argued with me for 10 min over $2!!!!"}
{"text":"Sardellas ! I worked I for them for years .The food is very good and I know they are very.up health standards.. i wont eat here any more because they raised the price for wings and pizza. Greedy! The ultimate at one time would cost just a little over 20 dollars' Now its almost 40 ! the wing are good but not that good. The pasta is cheap but"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza for not a lot of money.  Seating is nothing fancy.  We were there on a Friday night and the place was busy from the time we walked in until we left.  I thought we would have a longer wait for our order since they were so busy but no - pizza was delivered much faster than expected.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Sardella's is just ok. My biggest complaint is in the value. They charge $1.50 per topping on a large pizza and then REALLY SKIMP on them. The other day I ordered a large pepperoni, onion, mushroom , hot pepper and had it delivered. With delivery charge and a decent tip this was $25. I was shocked when I opened the box to find a total of 8 hot pepper rings on the entire pizza. The other toppings were nearly as sparse. I figure for 1.50 per topping, they could at least put 2-3 of everything on each slice of pie. Not a dismal 1. I probably wont spend my money here again."}
{"text":"Quick service and excellent pizza. We had the works pizza, everything was fresh and tasty. Ice cold beer and friendly staff. To top off this visit, we discovered they deliver to our house...."}
{"text":"Their wings are pretty tasty, but the Pizza is mediocre at best.  I guess they forgot that Pizza is supposed to have some sauce on it.  They smother it in cheese, crappy cheese at that,  as to me, it smells a little like baby vomit."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Very happy. I didn't actually get to enjoy the pizza, because I called from out of state for my friends that had a dead battery and had not eaten all day. 

All I have to say is that this place was great. After I told them about the situation and that I was out of state, but ordering for people that were there, they were extremely accommodating. Took us a minute to get through the credit card thing, so I would suggest ordering and having the people pay with cash if they can, or get the credit card of the people picking it up. But all in all, the hungry guys got their food, and said that it was wonderful. 

I recommend this place, even though I haven't eaten there. If I am ever in Glendale AZ..."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and wings for my son's birthday. I was skeptical due to the mediocre reviews but pleasantly surprised by the quality & taste!  The wings were perfect - tasty & crispy!  The white pizza & buffalo chicken pizza were awesome!!!  All in all amazing quality at a reasonable price!! Great value! Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this place was having a particularly good night, but we ordered pizzas on new year's day and they were both great!! We had one pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was divine - and about $10.
My brother lives nearby, if I were closer, this would be my new pizza place. I highly recommend giving it a try. It's scrumptious."}
{"text":"Pizza is always hot and fresh. We go to Sardellas regularly.  Its better than having it delivered."}
{"text":"Ok, I am biased because I went to them soliciting a donation for our school's Red Ribbon Week, and they were one of the few businesses who generously donated.  I love that they are a family business.  I like their pizza, but I REALLY like their wings.  I ordered them hot, and they were the perfect.  The right amount of sauce, too (I hate when the sauce is skimpy).  I am picky when it comes to hot wings, so I'm glad I tried them out."}
{"text":"Wings were delicious. I would have rated the wings alone 5 stars if they didn't cost $20.  The pizza was delicious, too. Also $20.

Total tab from receipt, including the \"Mini Ultimate\" discount was $41.36, including a $3 tip and $3 delivery charge. For 1 pizza and wings.

I would have gladly paid $20-25 for a pizza (large pepperoni, onion, mushroom, olive, and sausage) and wings (honey barbecue) that tasted like this. The icing on the cake would have been actually getting the tomatoes they charged me $1.70 for but didn't include.

I would not recommend this place unless you have extra money burning a hole in your pocket and don't mind being ripped off. The girl that answered the phone had a super friendly voice and was super condescending.  The delivery man complained about how hard the place was to find and griped about the drive.  

The food isn't bad, and I'd recommend this place if the service wasn't so poor and the food so overpriced."}
{"text":"Although, this was the first-time that I have tried Sardella's this will not be my last trip to this restaurant and even thought they are in my neighborhood, I am sorry I waited so long. The food was fantastic the suicide wings, pizza, and salad was excellent."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in 30 minutes before close  one evening. We ordered a large veggie pie with 1/2 side add sausage. The motz was minimal and mediocre. The sausage tasted like pre-packaged crumbles. The mushrooms were artificial and straight out of a slimy can. The crust was under cooked and forgettable. The only ingredient that was worth a darn was the sauce.  I've baked far superior pies in my own oven and they came from a freezer."}
{"text":"5 Stars for the Gluten Free effort! This is the best gluten free pizza I have had so far. I have tried a lot of the store brand gluten free and nothing comes close. We order both types- regular and gluten free- and my kids usually eat some of the gluten free - of their own free will. :) They did a great job taking time to get to market with something tasty instead of putting out another mediocre or bad tasting gluten-free product. Thank you Sardella's! I can't speak to the pasta dishes yet, but hopefully they are just as good as the pizza!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Sardella's pizza, but only their individual square slices that I get when I dine in. I am not the biggest fan of their delivered pizza.

Their square pizza by the slice is extremely puffy and two slices fills me up nicely. The pricing isn't bad either.

I would suggest going in and trying them instead of ordering and getting the regular pizza. Even though it is hand tossed, I don't think it is as good as other pizza options near by."}
{"text":"First time, new to the area. Received a complimentary pizza coupon so I checked it out. Picked up a pepperoni and place was packed which is a good sign. Smelled good on the ride home. Gotta say, it's pretty solid. They'll definitely win my return business. I'll review again if necessary."}
{"text":"Ordered two dozen wings this evening as Spinato's in the north valley doesn't do wings... was very disappointed as 6 of the 24 wings were the tip of the wing and thus inedible. $25 for 24 wings is ridiculous if the wings were perfect, let alone the mess we were given as take out. Hot wings were flavorless and had clearly been sitting for quite a while. Heard great things about this place prior to trying and now won't be back. If I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"So I ate here in October of 2013...1 year ago. That is how much it has lasted in my mind. I was staying in town for a few days and ate here 3 times. It is the best pizza I have ever had in my life, and it makes me want to go from San Diego where I live back to Phoenix just to eat here.

The prices and specials cannot be beat, the portions are a good size, the staff is friendly and they are located very conveniently if you are staying at a near by hotel.

If I was on death row and had a choice of a final meal, a pizza from here would be the answer."}
{"text":"I grew up on Sardella's and I enjoy it every time I eat it. This store offers a kids camp, which my kids really enjoyed (great price) Amazing customer service. I would recommend everyone check it out."}
{"text":"We used to come to Sardella's once or twice a month for the Monday night pizza deal. It was perfect for our family and our favorite pizza. At the start of this year we noticed that the prices went up and the pizza quality went down. I don't know what they did to their recipe but it's not what it was last year. We haven't been since February because of that."}
{"text":"Perfect place to grab a quick slice. Pizza was tasty and fast. The garlic knots were very garlicky (perfect!!!). The wings were decent. Not the best I've ever had but still good. The service was friendly. It's a quaint little place but had a nice comfortable vibe to it. I'll definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I've had their pizza, wings, garden salad, garlic knots, chicken Parmesan and chocolate chip cookies.  All are delicious!  Today I had an order delivered with Chicken Parmesan, a garden salad and cookies.  I tried really hard to save some of the chicken for tomorrow's  lunch but couldn't stop eating it.  And I have a small appetite!  So good!!!  Their delivery people are very nice also."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time...I wanted to check out their half price pizza deal on Mondays.  I thought the pizza was great!  Great flavor and perfect thickness on the crust.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sardellas customer service is awesome very friendly, but the handful of times I've been there I immediately got food poisoning so I will not be returning again"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time taking my boys to Pizza Camp yesterday!  The staff was wonderful!  Friendly, professional, prepared!  And the pizza and food was excellent and they even let the parents take a look inside the kitchen, see the ingredients, etc. had a chance to chat with one of the owners. Nice young man of 28 years old with two children himself. 

He invokes what the American Dream is about and what gives me hope for the future of the young people today in our country. He's responsible, courteous and caring. 

I've been going to various sardellas for over 20 years. I still have there jingle freshly in my head!  The pizzas are made with the freshest ingredients, HOT, bubbly cheese, etc. 

Place was extremely clean and organized and my boys loved learning about the pizza making business and making their own pizzas. It was a great morning and one that none of us will ever forget!  Hats off to you guys. Oh by the way all of this for only $10 a child you get to make a medium pizza with one topping, a drink and an an incredible experience!

Salute!"}
{"text":"Their wings were much better before. I usually order extra crispy. The ones I got today were soggy and nasty. I got them re-made but even those weren't all that good."}
{"text":"Second time ordering from this location. Same issues.

Wing sauce filled the bag, sloppily put together. Box was smashed, driver checked for us to see if pizza was damaged. Says it never happens. Second time in a row for us....

They lady taking my call was ruder than usual. Seemed annoyed my dogs began barking when family rang the doorbell. Even after I had moved into the garage right after they began. As if she couldn't forgive it happened.

She didn't offer any sort of pizza and Wing special; I purchased pizza and wings separately for $50.50 exactly. Fifty bucks for a large pizza and wings. 

I figured maybe this is some gourmet stuff here!
Horrible choice and I feel swindled. I should have stuck with my usual pizza joint."}
{"text":"Rude counter staff and pizza not ready. Walked out and went to Domino's Pizza. They need to their  train staff on customer service. This was our first visit to this location."}
{"text":"Horrible placed an order said they couldn't find the address then said they were at the address knocking and ringing the doorbell none of which was true.  When talked on the phone they said they knew where it was they deliver on the street all the time not a difficult address or a hard one to find"}
{"text":"I had the gf medium 2 topping pizza and it costs me $21.37. Yikes. But you get what you pay for I thought when i shelled over the money. But when I got the pizza, it had fresh toppings but the crust was the equivalent of a burnt cookie that had sat on the stove too long - hard and crunchy. It definitely wasn't worth 21 bucks. But you live and learn, and I've learned that this is not my place."}
{"text":"Used to be 5 star. Amazing food. Was amazing until they did away with not only Sicilian choice. But took away 24 wing order??? Why? 12 or 36 now? The deal before was way more reasonable large + 24 wings. Easy decision. Now it's smaller $25 or 40+ dollar order with to many. Not really making sense. 

Plus Sicilian was a rare find. Going downhill. Bring the deals back. Large 24 was perfect price. Il Primo still offers, even Barros granted worse wings. Cmon Sardella, you are a local. Figure it out."}
{"text":"Sardella's has been our go to place for pizza since we moved to this side of the valley four years ago. We usually order to go or delivery, but sometimes also dropped by the restaurant and eat there. Pizza is just right, son loves the dough knots that come with it every time. We are not going to any other pizza place any time soon."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials, got the slice of pizza with 6 Wings. Have. Complaints. They are super nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Sardella's is decent.  There's nothing about this pizzeria that stands out.  Everything about the place is decent.  The service, restaurant and food is all average.

I don't recall what day I was there but they did have a good buy 1 get 1 deal that left me with multiple meals.  

Don't expect to have your socks knocked off but if you're in the area and in the mood for pie Sardella's will do the trick."}
{"text":"Great, speedy service and delicious pizza! Love how happy employees always seem to be!"}
{"text":"Love Sardella's Pizza and wings!!  Their buffalo chicken pizza is the best!!  I could eat it EVERY day (if I could).  Always have had great service and food!  Chicken wings are also very good (bit small) but delicious!  I look forward to the days I can eat here :)  I would recommend it to anyone!!"}
{"text":"This used to be the best  place in the Valley to get Pizza and Wings. The  pizza is still pretty good but the wings leave something to be desired now. They are extremely dry with hardly any meat on them at all. I have had to complain a few times. I keep getting told the wings depend on the supplier. Time to get a  new supplier I think so you can be the place you used to be. The prices have also gotten pretty expensive."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Clean restrooms. Excellent food. Large servings. Outstanding customer service. I will come back!! :)) Thanks Brooke!!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely disappointed in this place. First and last time Im ever going back. I placed an order for traditional wings and well done pizza and when I got home it's completely wrong which was so devastating because I was craving wings sooo bad. I got the order and it was boneless wings and pizza was not well done, two simple requests. But that's alright I called and spoke to one of the managers David and was told that he would write a note to waive my next order so I can give it another try. Well, tonight I was again craving wings and pizza. So I thought, perfect I will call and get the order done again. When I called and spoke to Carlos I was told there was no note or anything under my number and did not care at ALLL. He said my ONLY options was to call corporate?? You have got to be kidding me. I'd rather save the hassle just never go back to Sardella's and stick to Barros."}
{"text":"We've relocated from the Midwest & are accustomed to very flavorful food from all nationalities with the best service. 
This Sardella's has some of the best cheeses & the freshest ingredients we've tasted from an Italian pizzeria! 
The service has been excellent (excepting one call in order) for each & every dine in experience. We've become frequent customers. 
The menu is extensive & the staff is extremely helpful. At the end of a busy week, this is my famines favorite GoTo Resturant.!!!"}
{"text":"I really love the pizza here as well as the garlic knots!! Both times I've moved recently I got the free pizza coupon in the mail! I just got home and opened up my pizza and found a cookie!! How awesome is that! (It was wrapped of course). I'll definitely be coming here more often! thanks Sardella's!"}
{"text":"Sardellas is alright and has a lot to offer.  There pomodoro with ricotta cheese as a topping is excellent and unique.  Their cookies are quite good as well.  I haven't been impressed with their pastas or garlic knots.  I enjoy their pizza combinations.  This place needs some better deals.  Bring back the Monday 50% off pizzas."}
{"text":"Pizza was so greasy that had to take out of box and wipe grease out! Wings overload with sauce but still taste good."}
{"text":"Worst service! General manager was a complete jerk. He basically told my honor roll student age of 9 yrs old, who cares you worked hard we will not honor his free pizza because it was torn and the other half was washed in washer and gone. it wasn't a situation where I didn't know where the other half was or someone else is going to come in with the other half  I as a parent know for a fact that the other half was completely ruined and just garbage gone no one is going to use it . my poor son was so upset then the manager refused to even let me buy a pizza incase I were to contact my bank!!!! I went to school with one of the owners Suns at arrowhead elemantry and then high school for a little bit, not that that means anything, but his dad would come in at least once a year and bring pizza for our class. I never would have thought a family buisness would allow that type of behavior or attitude to represent their name."}
{"text":"Wings and pizza is good, but pricey. Their customer service is the worst if they made your meal wrong. Make it difficult to get it fixed especially if it was delivered they make you drive to their location to get your correct order. Also they send out mailers with the specials but when you call they say it is no longer available at that price, although I just got it in the mail that day.   So their food is good but not great for the prices, and I heard they just hiked their prices again. Was a customer for some time but with all the bad experiences will not be going back."}
{"text":"Such good pizza! We dined in and had a large half veggie half BBQ chicken. The value of the pizza is amazing considering how high the quality is. Delicious fresh crust and toppings. The service we received in the store was top notch as well."}
{"text":"Girls talking about there weekends with there boyfriends instead of working. Maybe because it was a slower time of going but it seemed very unprofessional . 3 blonde girls touching there hair and then touching food without hand washing or gloves. Not a restaurant I would like to come back to."}
{"text":"This is my second visit. They have nailed it again! This place is spot on! Perfect pizza!"}
{"text":"Sardella's does a pretty decent pizza and with the location it's convenient to stop in an pick one up on the way home. That's about as good as it gets. It's like rolling the dice when you order from here. You ask for blue cheese with your wings you get ranch. You order a pizza without an ingredient you are allergic to, you might get the ingredient anyway. And honestly, how hard is it to cut a pizza. I don't think I've ever been to a pizza place that has cut a pizza in a way that there were little triangle pieces in the middle. Not just once, but 3 times. 
Today was the last straw, I truly saw what was behind this locations issues. I spoke to a guy behind the counter that appeared to be running the store about my last pizza that was supposed to be half works, but ended up less than a third covered with toppings. His feed back was \"yeah?', 'Have you ever tried to make a pizza?'. Are you kidding me? I told him I was only trying to bring it to his attention and he continued on with 'Listen, I have to feed 100 people/hour'. That's a great attitude and clearly shows that Quality Assurance is NOT Sardella's primary objective. Take it for what it is, I've been coming to this location on just about a weekly basis but I can confidently say that I can only put up with so much."}
{"text":"They have really tasty wings and i LOVE their pizza! Delivery is always fast and they have coupons regularly in the paper. We really go here for the Hot Wings but they are so addicting and delicious that we can't help it!"}
{"text":"Staff always rushes you and some are very rude on the phone... but the pizza is usually worth it. Half of all regular priced pizza on Mondays- amazing deal."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and the service is fast.

It's a little pricey for me sometimes. I wish there were more deals, like 25 cent wing Wednesday. 

Again the service is really good and the food is good."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the wings. The sauce was great but the chickens must have been anorexic as there was hardly any meat on them   Pizza was ok."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp cause hubby and I wanted pizza. Great location, super cozy clean and friendly atmosphere, and the staff was so friendly!!! Oh and the pizza is AWESOME we got full for under ten bucks :) love the price of your combo meals. This will be a regular pizza stop for us now!"}
{"text":"Sardellas was great, better than great. The pizza great quality, enough extras (some companies skimp on the extras if offered at all) my only complaint is I paid with a credit card and they offered several different %rates for the tip.  I planned on paying cash so I skipped it.  After placing the order I realized I forgot the ranch.  I called them back so they added it on no problem.  The problem is when they delivered I expected to sign a recipe and add the tip since the ranch was added on as cash. There was no receipt to sign.  I feel horrible for not being able to leave a tip for the delivery person.   Bottom line,  read everything before you click the order button"}
{"text":"Being a pizza snob and feeling like I come from where they make the best pizza in the country, NYC, this place is a travesty. I gave it a shot based on reviews from in laws and coworkers...guess they have never had great pizza.  I understand that this is also the choice of my daughters school when they have pizza day...when I asked her what she thought of it her reply was, \"I'd rather have a Totino's frozen pizza!\" (Enough said)  For all you pizza lovers out there....my advice to you would be to steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"I don't get all the hype about this place.  It was OK pizza...needed more sauce or flavor or something."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner from here tonight. DELISH! Garlic knots were garlicky and so tasty!  I had the Pomodoro pizza with thin crust...again very delicious!  I will order from them again!"}
{"text":"This place was always my go to for wings and pizza and now they have the worst customer service. The employees act like they could careless about business. Hope they get their act together."}
{"text":"I order from here most of the time. I love there pizza, wings, garlic knots, and their spaghetti. The service is always great. I like trying new places but find myself coming back to sardellas! I would say I'm a regular. I also love the fact that their a Christian business! They do what they can to bring a living Jesus to a dying world!"}
{"text":"Yo yo yo Az peeps... If your looking for great pizza and wings Sardella's is the place .  If you have gluten sensitivity , no worries they got you covered. 
If your like me and you care that it's clean ,look for the  \"A \"in the window , then you found the right spot at 32nd street and Greenway."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza for home delivery. The delivery was nearly a half hour EARLY! (When is the last time you have been able to say THAT?!)  Sardellas Pizza always comes through. It is warm, well cooked, and there is always a small warm chocolate chip cookie in the box. If you subscribe to their email program you will be alerted of occasional specials that are reserved only for email customers."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas and they come dropped . Pic posted . Delivery drug addict ran off before we opened box . Learn how to hold a box level"}
{"text":"We stopped by here yesterday on the way back from the game and fish expo.  I did not have pizza because I am watching my diet.  I did try the traditional hot wings and they were pretty good.  I order a pasta dish and it was really good.  The meat balls on the dish were really good too.  This was the forth time we have eaten here and it was time for a review.  The pizza was good the last time I had it and the family seems to enjoy it also."}
{"text":"Good wings.  A person who worked there recommended the Gold Fever sauce.  I must say I was not disappointed.  It was spicy, yet tasty...  two things I like when I eat wings.  Too bad I don't live closer or else this would be a good place to go when I have a wing fix."}
{"text":"First time here...came here for lunch with our son's basketball game before their game. We ordered a thin crust pepperoni pizza and garlic knots...both were delicious...food came fast...good service and good price."}
{"text":"The best pizza & wings around.
Great menu, good prices and fast service.
We love dining out at Sardella's, the staff is very friendly and courteous. Thank you guys!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large half pepperoni and jalapeño pizza for pick up. We arrived 15-20 after the order was placed as suggested by the girl taking the order. When we got home and opened the box it had looked like they made the pizza hours prior and threw the toppings on and threw it back in the oven. Probably the worst pizza I've had. I also tried contacting Sardellas through social media to remedy the issue and was responded with \"sorry about your pizza. Please provide your email or phone number so we can get in contact with you.\" I provided the information and still have not been contacted.


Mike stepped up and acknowledged their mistake and issued a credit. Good to see them stand by their product"}
{"text":"We ordered a large pepperoni pizza NY thin crust. The crust was soggy in the middle, the sauce and pepperoni had very very little flavor and it was too greasy. Overall we won't go back. Dominos and Pizza Hut have better flavor. 

It was like eating a slice of warm rubbery cheese."}
{"text":"Wings are a disappointment. They should really be labeled as mini or just be offered as a kid menu item. Would not recommend to anyone with gap teeth. There were no reports of missing pet birds in the area but I have my suspicions."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good, and was delivered well within the givin time- frame.   I will definitely continue to be a customer."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings! The bold gold wings are by far the best wings, no comparison around!"}
{"text":"Okay if I didn't know better I swear they read my yelp review.... waaaaay better this time.. cheeeessy goey yummy giant calzone with artichoke and tomato,  i could barley eat half off... got the regular wings this time WAAAY better.. super nice friendly young wipper snapper delivery dude.. sooooo thumbs up :P"}
{"text":"My family is visiting Phoenix this week and I did plenty of Yelp research to find restaurants that could accommodate my gluten sensitive son. There were a few places with gluten free pizza, but we chose Sardellas since he could also get GF cheesy bread and the menu was clearly labeled with GF options. I was SO impressed with Sardellas! First, the cashier was very knowledgeable about the menu, they then stamp the ticket with gluten free so the kitchen is aware. My son loved his pizza! My other son got a slice of regular cheese and my husband and I got the buffalo chicken pizza. Overall we were very impressed by the cleanliness, food quality and attentiveness of the staff. We'll be back on our next trip down!"}
{"text":"One of the first places I eat at when I'm back in town, the chicken wings are so yummy and spicy!! I still wish they would open up some shops in Southern California!!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive pizza! 

There are other pizza places in town that serve up better pizza but not for the price. They almost always have a great special going. they are one of the only places in town that actually slice meatballs for your \"meatball\" pizza. Too often when i order a meatball pie it is just ground beef. It's rare that I get it delivered since they are so close to me. Pizza is ready in less than 15 minutes and still hot when you get it home. 

Call them for your Friday night pizza! I do."}
{"text":"Friendly drivers. Great pizza. Great service. AMAZING wings. My favorite wings in the valley. And their pepperoni and bacon pizza is on point. I like the seasoning on the calzones and their ranch is really good! 

But the wings... Gotta try the wings!"}
{"text":"One of my kids favorite places to come have pizza. The employees are always nice & the place is clean everytime we've come here. See you guys next time!"}
{"text":"Just had some pizza and BBQ wings. Pizza was good, wings great!!!! Driver was a real nice young fella. Was the best I have had in the Arrowhead area. Will be back. It only took like 35 min. Keep up the good work.."}
{"text":"I love mom and pop pizza joints. This one is a great one. I haven't found a good calzone in years, first one I ordered from here I knew I found a great local pizza joint. Can't wait to try more items on the menu in the future. Gave it 4 stars because when I was ordering online it wouldn't find my address. But I guess that has nothing to do with the he food which was great"}
{"text":"Never, ever, ordering from here again. Tonight, again, the pizza was cold, barely any cheese, and not close to the expectations of Sardella's.  We use to have them as our number one \"go to\", but no longer.... We ordered at 6, on Tuesday? (we were told 30 minute delivery time)  and we didn't get our pizza until after 7.... cold and rubbery.  Big air pockets on the pizza and very, very little cheese.  SO DISAPPOINTING!!!"}
{"text":"Best customer service in town. Love that they have a gluten free menu. Love that they are so friendly. They took extra care to ensure food preparation safety and were just super nice. We just moved to the neighborhood and will definitely be making this a staple."}
{"text":"Very pleased with service and food!  The cashier was helpful even though I was indecisive,  The delivery man came out of the office to open our beers and they deliver all the way to northern and 67th! Great thin crust \"works\" pizza!  Success finally my husband and I can order pizza at home"}
{"text":"Although this is a pizza place, I come here for the wings. I love the atmosphere and the location."}
{"text":"We always get the spaghetti and meatball here. On Wednesday, correct me if I'm wrong, they have a 2 for $9.99 spaghetti special. It's very good and better than paying double at Olive Garden or some fancy Italian restaurant. Service is always good. The kids are nice."}
{"text":"This'll be a short one, but I love coming in here. Pizza is good, but I REALLY love the wings. Plus, these guys always seem to have a good time, serving their patrons. And to really make this a really good visit, Nick(Assistant Mgr.), instead of replying \"NO PROBLEM\", when I said thank you, he replied with, \"You're Welcome\". I LOTHE, the NO PROBLEM, reply. Been coming here, forever. I love it."}
{"text":"I don't know about you, but I love Sardellas. Given, it is not REAL italian pizza but it's some good bread, sauce and meat!

The dough just has such great flavor mmm the sauce isn't overwhelming and doesn't give me heartburn. The hot wings are crunchy and delicious!

This place is pretty messy sometimes and is stuffy.

If I want good cheap(er) pizza, Sardellas is always my go-to. I think I'll go eat some now :)"}
{"text":"I visited here for a quick late lunch. Because I missed the lunch crowd I thought for sure that it would take a while for a single slice of Hawaiian pizza and wings. I was so wrong. I had quick service in 10 minutes with a fresh slice. It was wonderful and the crust was perfectly crisp. The buffalo wings were perfectly cooked. They could have had a little bit more meat on them but combined with the pizza I really didn't need it.

The service was great. Go here, it is a must."}
{"text":"This place makes the best Pizza in Arizona! Fresh and fast delivery! Great tasting Pizza and Salads!!

Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"Sardella's Pizza is the best in all of Arizona! Pizza with great flavor and taste and the perfect salad to go with it!! We will continue to order their incredible food like we were back in Italy! 

Thank you staff for your prompt service and excellent pizza and salads!

Greg"}
{"text":"I am from wester New York and have some pretty high Pizza and Wing standards. The pizza here is good. The dough is thick enough to be a little doughy, but thin enough to be a little crunchy. The cheese can be heavier than I like at times, and the sauce is not as sweet as I like it, but overall not bad.
Now let's talk wings. Being a Buffalo girl makes me super picky with wings. They have to be more on the crunchy side and not drenched in sauce and soggy. These wings usually have a bit more sauce than I like, so I think they are better the second time after warming them up in the oven. 
Overall not shabby."}
{"text":"The spaghetti and meatballs are okay but the pizza is very bland with little to no flavor. This place is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"When we want takeout pizza, Sardella's is a no-brainer for us.  It is near by so delivery is always HOT and whatever we order arrives fast. Plus the pizza here is good, just not jump up and down pizza good, just good. 

What was ordered: Grand kids are visiting tomorrow so we ordered plenty of food to feed them the next day as well.

Side of meatballs in marinara.  (came with 5 garlic knots)
The meatballs wern't bad same for the marinara sauce. Nothing special but good. Garlic knots hardly had any garlic on them. 
Med. Buffallo Chicken Pizza - hand tossed - good amount of toppings on throughout the pizza
Large Pepperoni & sausage - hand tossed -good amount of toppings on throughout the pizza came with with 20 wings (med.)

PRICE: The prices are reasonable. The prices are fair for the quality
 they are competitive. SERVICE: The guy at the counter was nice and polite. FOOD: WINGS - I am VERY picky about my wings. First bite from one tells me everything I need to know and IF I'll have more. Sardella's wings are big, jucy and not slathered in sauce like some places. They were just right. So If you're craving wings this is a good place because they are better than alot of places out there for wings. PIZZA: Satisfied and fulfilled everyonescraving. The crust is just right, not too thick and not too thin and cooked just right.. The tomato sauce had a nice balance of flavors to itand is perfectly seasoned: MEATBALLS: a little bland the marinara sauce was OK I've had way better. CONCLUSION: Everybody seemed satisfied with their food and I was too.  NOT the best pizza & wings but good. They have good variety on the menu in addition to pizza they have pasta, salads, Calzones and wings!"}
{"text":"this place! Pizza and wings are always on point and delivery drivers are always awesome!"}
{"text":"Bought a large Pizza for my self and it lasted 3 days and was great. It tasted very fresh and very good. It wasn't over cooked like allot of places are and the toppings were great and evenly arrange on the whole pie. My favorite part, other than the great taste, was that it lasted me 3 days and cost me less than $15. I will return to explore the rest of their menu ."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in Sardella's. I wanted delivery and they declined my request. I just got back from work so I really was not in the mood to drive and I was really craving for some Sardella's pizza. I mean their the best but this was the worst news I heard all month  ugh. Called, Spoke with Zackary on 43 Ave & Cactus and he said no way... really? Does Sardella's need extra gas money or are they being cheap with their gas? Anyways, same difference. I just don't understand why they wouldn't serve me (a paying customer). Not cool Sardella's. You need more restaurants on the south side of Phoenix. Please take my advice and you won't be cheap on gas."}
{"text":"I love the pizza.  I order online all the time.  Recently my computer died and I had to order via tablet.  It took five tries to get the software to accept my address because of the zip code, even after I entered the zip code four times.  The address is pretty specific so why can't the software accept the address without it?"}
{"text":"This is one if my favorite pizza places! The prices are fair and the food is awesome! Been coming here for over 15 years!"}
{"text":"I love Sardella's!! they have great pizza and the winds are great!! they also have a killer monday special (half price pizza!)  this wings are so good they will make you wanna smack your momma!!"}
{"text":"The price was much higher than I thought it would be. 40 bucks for wings and pizza? The wings were pretty good. We had the bold gold and the hot. I would rate them right there with Barros which are some of my favorite wings. The pizza though was bland, very bland. It was also a little under cooked for my liking too. This was the first time I had tried Sardella's so even though I knew the price after ordering I was up to giving them a shot. I'll try anything once. I won't be back though. While the wings were good you have to come with the whole package for me to return."}
{"text":"My favorite place for pizza!!!!! The crust is the best and their sauce is delicious!! I love the wings too. Please bring a Sardellas to surprise!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Sardella's this afternoon to try their pie (with my fave topping, pepperoni). The restaurant has a cozy feel, the service was fast and friendly, and the pie was good; the cheese, sauce, and quality of the crust was better than what I get at most pizza chains. I'm glad, too, that they managed to keep their prices low."}
{"text":"We have had the pizza before and didn't eat most of it which is why I called and asked about a special for the wings, which are awesome! The female employee had major attitude issues (AKA bitchyness)  and the Manager lost his patience after the first few sentences. The conversation went...

Sardella's  special, Large cheese 16 inch pizza and 40 wings for 29.99. The wings alone are 28.00 even.

 I call and ask for the special but instead of a large I want a medium, I don't want to waste it because we cant eat a large and the pizza is just meh.

They tell me they cant do it.... I ask why not and state that they would have to use less ingredients and less effort to make a smaller pizza for the same price therefore making more money on their end.... 

They say well we cant change the special... I say but I'm not asking for something ridiculous... I just WANT LESS PIZZA FOR THE SAME PRICE. Again they say they  cant change the special. I ask them to make a small exception by shrinking the size of pizza they would have to make. They reply with \"well if I make exceptions for you I would have to make exceptions for other people but I can give you a medium for 5 dollars more...\" I decline and state I will be paying more to make a smaller pizza which is counterproductive to having a special. They get irritated and I fear they will spit in my food... 

I gave up... GOTTA LOVE EDUMICATED PEOPLE!!!   Or is there something I am not understanding in the pizza industry ???"}
{"text":"Cheap but good quality pizza!   Plus they included a cookie tucked under the pie :).  Even the cold pizza the next day was good.  Great job!"}
{"text":"The large 1 large topping pizza and wing deal is really good. My wife ate all the wings while I ate half the large pizza."}
{"text":"A friend and I wanted to try something out of Glendale for lunch. I know that there are a few Sardella's throughout the Phoenix metro area, BUT it was so nice to just sit outside and look at a nearby park and enjoy our food. Staff was super friendly and brought out our food to us. Their lunch specials are wonderful. I got 2 slices of pizza and a drink for $4 and pennies after tax. Good pizza on a beautiful day!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to Arizona and have been looking for a good pizza restaurant.  The second restaurant we tried was Sardella's and we will be back!  I got a Gluten Free crust which was crispy and yummy.  My husband, who is from the Chicago area, got a \"regular\" crust and loved it.  The flavor of the sauce was great.  The staff were very friendly and efficient.  A member of the staff came to our table and offered us water and boxes for our left overs.  Who does that?  No one else ever has.  The restaurant was clean which is a biggie for me."}
{"text":"Sardella's is reasonable pizza at an affordable price. It's very clean and pretty on the inside. The patio is pretty, especially at night. I don't know why this is, but ordering a whole pizza is not as good as getting the two slice meal- for whatever reason, whenever I've ordered the two slice value meal, I have always gotten better pizza than when I've eaten from a delivery pizza. I return to Sardella's because of location and it beats most of the pizza around here. Solid three stars!"}
{"text":"We love the consistently tasty pizza here from Sardella's - always a great blend of cheese and sauce and the crust is just right, not too thick and not too thin.  We always order from them once a week (sometimes twice) and they're very friendly and prompt.  Now if you're looking for tasty wings, this is THE place!  We love their wings, so tasty and delicious!  We order ours crispy and our choice of sauce is Traditional, bone in are the best!"}
{"text":"Great food the lunch was really reasonable prices pizza wings and drink 8 bucks. Friendly staff and quick service i would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Haven't ever order from Sardello's before. The email confirm said the order was placed & paid for it at 6:30pm with 54  minutes delivery time. However the food never arrived. I just called back a 9:30 pm (3 hours later) to check on the pie order. The guy tells me they have a wrong address but a right phone number. They clamied to have called to confirm the address but my cell phone shows, no incoming calls from Sardella's. If didn't leave a message.  I discussed my disappointment with the lack of a followup and no pizza thr  or remedies for a first time customer, out four hours of time. I will ee hours later. They offered no remedies or apologies to appease the situation. They just asked if I still wanted to order the pizza. Not sure about these guys. Reserving an extra star because I haven't tasted the pie yet. I still ordered it but was put off by the lack of ownership of the situation. Bad first time experience."}
{"text":"That Zelda chick is the shit!! Bestest employee hands down!! The food is pretty dope and will definitely be coming back for the food and service!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I found this place through Yelp. We were frustrated at Papa Johns because their online ordering wasn't working, and when we tried to call the store, the kid (couldn't have been over 18, this guy) told us he couldn't give us the same offers they have online. Major bummer, so let's try a smaller local place. That's what brought us to Sardella's.

One call, and our frustrations were over. Chastity was as thorough as she was nice. We got the Sunday Special: a large pizza, a family size pasta, and garlic knots, for a little over twenty bucks. Are you kidding me? What a value! We ordered this for lunch, and are still eating it come dinnertime. The Italian sausage in the pasta was perfectly spiced (not spicy though), and the garlic knots were kinda addictive.

So thanks, Sardella's, you are my new go-to. If I were having a sports watching party (there's a big game coming up I hear), I would definitely consider this place for their tasty food at good prices."}
{"text":"Tough call with the 4 or 5 star rating.  Let me explain.

I would give this Sardella's a five star rating due to my most recent experience.  Every year my family goes to this Sardella's to celebrate my wife's and my birthday with our immediate family (parents, brothers, sisters...) and there is usually enough room somewhere to fit a party of around 10-12.  They are very accomodating.  This recent trip we were enjoying our pizza and wings when one of the employees brings us an order of their cinna-bread which apparently they made in error so they simply gave it to us on the house.  We were very gracious as we were just finishing up the pizza and wings and had not ordered a dessert.  One bite of this cinna-bread said it all.  It was over the top, doughy, sugar laden, cinnamon sprinkled, crisscrossed icing heaven.  The entire family was overwhelmed with its taste in a good way.  Let's just say I recommend it.  

I give the four star because I simply can't give 5 for one experience but if there were a 4.5, I would solidly put it there.  The pizza is always good and the wings NEVER disappoint.  The people who work there are great and I have never had a bad experience with the service.  Ingredients are fresh as pizza joints go and I have been told by my family that the salads are fresh and tasty.  I have no clue because who eats salad at a pizza place like this?!  Great food and family times.

Where is that 4.5 star rating?!"}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I called ahead and ordered a pizza and salad for carry-out.  We heard about this location originally from her Daughter's gymnastics club ordering from there, and my Girlfriend has ordered from there before.  The pizza is very very good!  

However, here is my summary of other things:
*  Give more training on customer service to \"All Employees\" on quality customer service via the telephone and in person.

* Maybe change up the salad a little.  It seems almost like a pre-packaged salad.  A more homemade tasting and looking salad would really go great with  your pizza.

All in all, a good place to grab some quick dinner and in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"The meatballs and sauce were outstanding.
Pizza was just ok, but I'll keep in mind I was full on meatball and knots by the time I got to my standard slice of cheese pizza. 
I'd try this place again.
Service was extremely friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Don't do it!! It's not that great little pizza joint that you remember from high school. First off, on the bottom of the lunch combination menu it's clearly says add a topping to any slice for .50 cents. Well, my receipt says I paid a $1.25 for each topping on each slice. So a .99 cent slice of pizza turns out to be $2.25. I expressed my concern to the cashier but she assured me that the inflated price was correct. ?

Now the food...the overpriced single slice pizza that was ordered at 11:55am came out in five minutes. Pretty cool!...I guess. The dough was nice and fluffy but the tomato paste they call sauces could've used this thing called...seasoning. Oregano, parsley...hell, some old fashioned salt and pepper would've helped the canned paste. However, the Mediterranean Salad came out 20 minutes after ordering. At this point we were completely finished with our slices. No opportunity to enjoy the two items together. When the withered green mixture arrived it was so heavily drenched in an overpowering generic brand Italian dressing that it sat lifelessly flat in a black plastic bowl. It looked like it was someone's leftovers that needed to go in trash and not like a $4.99 side salad. Lifting the soggy marsh on top I WAS pleasantly surprised to find a few pieces of artichoke, English cucumber, and thinly sliced kalamata olives. Those slim pickings were the highlight. 

The dining room was pleasant and seemed clean. The floor of the cooking line where food is prepared was riddled with large pieces of debris. Considering the few people that WERE in there it didn't seem that it should've been that untidy. Maybe nobody is cleaning regularly... Sadly we have no plans of returning to the once adored childhood eatery. In fact, if you're driving by keep driving and stop somewhere else for pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza and wings today and ususally  when we get the wings, they are larger than what we got today. Maybe they have changed the supplier,  but they were not what we usually get. The pizza was great and customer service is fantastic. Melissa was very nice when I spoke with her and understanding."}
{"text":"This was the second time ordering delivery from Sardella's & they did not disappoint!! My hubby chose the hand tossed pizza with meatballs & I got the thin crust NY with ricotta & black olives. The hand tossed was so fluffy & light, very very yummy!! My pizza was perfect with a little bit of crunch & then the creamy ricotta to go with, no complaints here. We also tried the small order of real garlic knots, NY style........... Those were soft & chewy, very fresh. We have zero complaints with this Sardella's & to top it off we were in the middle of a sandstorm & rain, yet delivery was still made at right under a hour, plus it's a Friday evening."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for 15 today. Ordering process was efficient and painless. Good service there. 

The food arrived right on time. I ordered: two pepperoni pizzas, one pomodoro pizza, one combo and one cheese pizza. I also got three-two liter bottles of soft drinks and two extra dippers. The total was $97 plus tip. Not bad for feeding 15 hungry guys. 

The pizzas had good sauce, which was seasoned well. The cheese was bountiful and the meats/veggies were fresh. The dippers were prepackaged packets and not worth the extra charge. They were ignored by the crew. 

I would recommend Sardella's for a group lunch."}
{"text":"Ordering from here for years. Until a couple years ago, I gave them 5 stars.
Then a couple pizza I ordered were not so good and I dropped them to 1 star. I mean they were really bad. I have tried them since a few times and have adjusted my review to 4 stars. 
The caveat is not to order anything with additional toppings. They skimp on the extras you pay for...in my cheap-o-I-want-what-I-pay-for mentality. 
Wings are always good."}
{"text":"I have been using this location since I moved close to them. I use to enjoy their food but lately the red sauce is bland and their pricing keeps going up. Forget the wings. 6 wings cost $6.95 (that's $1.15 for each small, small wing) and look like they came off the smallest chickens they could find. I see by other reviews they say they changed because the bigger wings were tough. If you get more than two bites off the wings they have now your doing good. How do the other thousand locations (Jo Jo's Family Pizza) that sell bigger and better wings at a cheaper price with even garlic do it?  Like I said they keep raising their prices but not quality. Even their Blanco pizza now is bland. Teach employees how to read the order correctly too. Back to another pizza and wings seller."}
{"text":"My husband showed me this place about three years ago! I don't know why it took me so long to write her of you but I really like their food. And it's really awesome that they deliver right to my work I call and they know my address so I don't even have to tell them every time. Super convenient easy and a moderately good price we usually get a large buffalo chicken pizza which is definitely One of the best pizzas they have I'd also recommend their barbecue chicken pizza and their chicken Parmesan! I will say though my favorite thing about them is there garlic knots they're so good! It's almost a tradition at my salon now to order sardellas at least once a month!!!"}
{"text":"We order take-out almost every Friday evening. Great food and friendly service is why we keep coming back. Shout out to Jared and everyone on staff! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"First time here, the food was great and the customer service was excellent!!  Everyone was polite and the restaurant was so clean.  We'll come here again for sure!"}
{"text":"I had them deliver four pizzas for an event with a client in their area. Delivery was fine and the price was within reason, but I've never had a more bland pizza in my life. The sauce had zero flavor. Horrible!"}
{"text":"My sister orders from this place all the time for work and she said to check it out so we did. I was excited when I saw the abundance of gluten free options on the menu. The best part..... It all tastes wicked good. We ordered the gluten free cheese bread which was oh so good. Then we moved on to the gluten free pizza with pineapple very yummy and it tastes like actual real pizza. This place does gluten free right!! We finished our dinning experience with the cinnamon bread which is gluten free of course! Wow it tasted so good I would have just eaten that. 

The service was very good: polite folks that have answers to questions and offer there honest opinions. Our food was pipping hot and served with a smile. Price was way better then I expected and I happily paid what we paid for our delicious meal. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza restaurants and Definitely one of the best pizza restaurants in the valley.  The pizza has also been on point for the years I have been coming here.  The spaghetti and meatballs is really good as well and worth a try."}
{"text":"Decided to give this spot a try when I received a coupon for a free medium pizza in my mail box (sweet!!). Customer service was beyond amazing. The cashier was friendly and patient, and then while waiting for our food they brought over complementary garlic bread! Needless to say, I felt welcomed and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pepperoni onion and bbq chicken pizza both of which had zero flavor. We were so disappointed that more than half of each pizza was thrown out. :( Although the delivery was quick we definitely won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, and really friendly service. Every time I eat here I've had a good experience with the quality of the food and how long it takes them to make and bring me my food. they have really good delivery also.."}
{"text":"Consistently pretty decent pizza for the price! I like the $9.99 large cheese pizza deal, and the large pepperoni pizza is pretty good too. The place is nice and clean inside at the on on 83rd/Lake pleasant area. Employees are nice & friendly"}
{"text":"The Sicilian crust is the best I've had West of Ohio. Just amazing. They offered a GF option which was also nice. Toppings skimpy so that's why I didn't give this 5 stars. Service quite pleasant. Suggestion to owner: would love fresh mushrooms vs canned."}
{"text":"This place was no more than decent. Good deals though, but at the cost of quality I think. I've only ordered once so I could be wrong. Here's what I got:

Suicide wings: 
With a name like that I thought they would be very very hot. They werent. Tasted like normal wings to me but that's okay because they were very tasty. 

Buffalo chicken pizza:
I didn't know this pizza came as squares and I hate squares.. lol. Oh well. Many of the pieces were mostly crust and there was very little chicken on it. The flavor was decent but to bite into it was.....chewy. similar to jerky. It wasn't crisp or satisfying. I won't ever order that again. It was a good price for a medium but I could've spent that money at Dominoes and had an awesome pizza...

Will I order again? Maybe for the wings...but not for the pizza. Maybe the rest of their pizza doesn't suck, who knows. I might order on a Monday to get half off that way if it does suck, it was cheap. Overall, this place was \"meh\". I only ordered because I wanted wings and for $25 I should've just gone to buffalo wild wings."}
{"text":"Sardella's used to be better back in the day like 10-15 years ago. The wings are still very delicious but too expensive and the pizza varies depending on the day. 

However, we enjoy us some Sardella's about 1-2 times a year. Give them a try but don't be surprised if you are sticker shocked."}
{"text":"Pizza I was better this time around. Seems like they have new staff with better training because the old quality was back."}
{"text":"Super family friendly and delicious. We will be coming back as my daughter requested specifically to come here from now on for pizza. The service was fast and everyone was kind. They went above and beyond... We left in a good mood."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good especially for the price and they serve a nice size too. My husband and I enjoy the thin crust; I would perfer it be a little more crispy but my husband thinks it's perfect as-is...just the right amount of cooked.
They have recently started mixing up the pizza selection by offering a monthly special which is pretty cool. All and all it's a good everyday pizza joint."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service can't go wrong with good food and great service! What else do you want? Clowns??"}
{"text":"You can always find a decent slice of pizza here.  The sauce and cheese are good, but occasionally applied sparingly.  I usually go with the thick crust.  It is better than the nationwide chains, but at times can be slightly undercooked."}
{"text":"This is a little far from me, but I had a friend bring me their Honey Barbeque wings 1 time. Those were some of the best darn honey bbq wings I've had. Too bad I don't live closer. I'd definitely be coming here more often."}
{"text":"I didn't try the wings but I tried the Chicken they made at the \"Check Please Festival\" and it was moist, tasty and better than a lot of what I tried at that festival. If Sardella's can make decent chicken at a \"Festival\" there is no excuse for the dry tasteless chicken I had at other places.

We ordered a Thin what they call New York Style and a Hand Tossed Pomodoro. They offer 4 styles of crust in addition to the Thin and Hand Tossed they offer Thick and Gluten Free Wheat.

I do have to say the toppings on the Pomodoro are DELICIOUS! The Pomodoro is topped with Garlicy Tomatoes, Basil, Italian Seasoning, Cheeses and sauce. The crust is very mild and soft almost like a soft roll. it might be Arizona style crust because much of the bread out here is like that. 

The Thin Pizza what they call New York Style would be better if they didn't call it New York Style because it's not like a \"real New York.\" My Thin Pizza was very thin as they promised. The crust was very thin and didn't fall apart from the toppings.  The ends were crispy and had an almost a fried dough taste. The sauce seemed above average.



Prices are very family friendly and Service is Quick."}
{"text":"They are ok but a bit over priced for what you get. Ok Pizza, Ok small wings. 3 stars is about right overall for average."}
{"text":"Sells individual, on the small side but dirt cheap, slices, as well as whole pies, wings, pasta, and calzones. Dine in, delivery and take out. Fast, friendly, service, does lots of couponing and offers half priced pizza pies on Mondays."}
{"text":"I used to love Sardellas... Pizza, wings and cookies. But now with the crazy tiny wings, it's just not worth going out of my way. Staff says they are aware of the issue, but offer no solutions or discounts for offering substandard product. To add insult to injury, this time we got a point of a wing counted towards the order.  Let me know when you fix it and I'll give you another chance. But at this point, you've lost this formerly regular customer."}
{"text":"This at one time was my favorite place for wings.  I LOVE the flavor of their mild sauce.  So about 3 years ago I would have given this a 5+ stars but now its hard to give 2.   The reason is I often find feather nubs on the wings....NASTY!  The wings also now have a lot of crushed or broken bones.   They must have changed their vendor for the wings and I really wish they would change back cause I do miss that sauce.   I even dip my pizza crust in it! 
I have always gotten take out so I cant review the employee's attitudes but they are nice on the phone.   When I pick up the place is always busy but clean."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and wings twice from this location.   The first time the wings/pizza were ok at best.   Second time it was delivered quick and the food was good.

First time I ordered a dozen wings,  and they gave me 8.  The second time I ordered 30 wings and they gave me 20.  Their counting skills are horrible.

There are so many good pizza joints out they're,  go with them.   If you want to gamble on what you will get order here.   I will not return."}
{"text":"When an order that I phoned in went awry at pickup tonight, the manager stepped in and solved the problem with speed and a smile. My eleven year old daughter learned the importance of being valued as a customer and I am so appreciative of the outstanding customer service. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I really like this location. We dined in a few months back and the staff is super friendly. Even passing out free garlic knots WOOHOO! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Such great customer service! Very clean, friendly, brought out garlic knots while we were waiting for our pizza and they were DELICIOUS! Definitely will be coming here very often! Also, got 4 pieces of 1 topping pizza and a drink for $8! Husband and I were completely full, portion sizes are great."}
{"text":"Love love love their pizza! Also if it's your first time you should try their garlic knots with marinera sauce! It's bomb. I do wish they delivered to my house but because their pizza is so good I don't mind driving to pick it up. It's so good you won't regret going there."}
{"text":"I'm a total pizza snob. I've had a hard time finding great pizza here in the valley and Sardella's is now my go-to pizza joint.   :D

You can tell by the food and the service that this place is a family owned small chain and not a big commercial business. 

There are plenty of toppings on every pizza. When I eat at large chain places I often feel like I got ripped off because the toppings are so skimpy. I've seen other reviews saying the opposite but I have been impressed every single time about my toppings. Well...almost every time...

Once I ordered a pepperoni pizza with half sausage. It was delivered and when I opened it, there was 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 sausage. It was a good amount of sausage, but it was supposed to be sausage and pepperoni on that half. I was disappointed bc this was the first time I've had an order messed up with Sardella's. I called and was passed on to a manager. He was great, and more than resolved my issue. 

When I find a place with amazing management as well as great food, I'm thrilled. Sardella's fits the bill!  

Only thing I dislike is picking up pizza there. The kids who work the counter are sometimes...socially awkward. It's also located between a liquor store and a creepy dive bar. There are lots of...I dunno...creepy looking dudes hanging out in front of the building smoking and such. I just get delivery most the time to avoid this. It's worth the extra money to me."}
{"text":"Just good food. Fast and awesome. Try the Calzones!!!!  Very good. Friendly with fast delivery"}
{"text":"good clean and fast try the desert pizza great hot"}
{"text":"Do NOT order from this Yelp app. 30 minutes after I ordered, Eats24 called because I had two orders in. The reason I had two orders in is because immediately after the first order, I noticed the delivery address was wrong. I called Sardella's and they had no record of the order. I called three times waiting for the order to show up and finally said I'd order again. 
Well, 30 minutes after the second order, eats24 called. They had apparently never submitted the first order, so it was going to be an additional HOUR before I got the pizza. 
DO NOT ORDER FROM THE YELP APP. 
And eats24 can eat1."}
{"text":"Ahh yes, Sardella's and their $5 medium pizza special. The location near 19th Ave and Union is my Sardella's home base. We grab a cheapie medium cheese to go quite often (the price is not good for delivery).

The toppings, ingredients & cheese is much better than what you would find at those national chains.

For a small shop cooked, good medium pizza, you can't beat 5 bucks. Try their ranch dressing as well. It's made in house and is delish."}
{"text":"All time favorite for many years. Live the prices, people, menu and fresh ingredients. I love to order pizza and meatballs for the kids and salad for me to take to work in Monday. They're so fresh! Not wilty, nor bland. Makes a Monday worth looking fwd to :D"}
{"text":"Decent pizza, good wings, a little pricey.  I got the lunch special, a slice of cheese pizza, drink and 5 wings.  I tried the Gold Fever wings.  They were great, a little too saucy but cooked perfectly and very flavorful.  The pizza was just \"meh\".  For what I paid (just under $8), I wanted more wings or a bigger slice.  You can't beat the Costco deal of a huge slice and a drink for under $4.  But I would go back here because it was decent and who wants to suggest to a client \"let's meet at Costco!\"?"}
{"text":"Delivery was less than the 45mins, the guy was polite, food was good and they even put a cookie in the box"}
{"text":"Not impressed with prices the  large pizza and 36 wing special for 56.00 is highway robbery."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite pizza place. I love the pizza always delicious and the employees are friendly and always very busy. I am from Brooklyn NY and I have eaten my fair share of pizza and Sardellas, is outstanding!!!!! I love this place. Even though I have moved outside of the area they deliver to I drive to get it. It is worth the trip. Love Sardellas!!!!"}
{"text":"Just spent $30 on the pizza and wing special the wings were literally baby chicken wings and the pizza is just not good not sure why these pizza places get away with price gouging, should have went to Ray's Pizza same price but you get 24 wings that are nice and juicy and the pizza straight-up legit so I'm giving them an extra star because that was my fault"}
{"text":"Love this Sardellas! Everyone working there is super polite and attentive. Josh, the manager is always smiling and helpful. My kids love the pizza, and I love that they support the community so much! Girl scout cookies out front tonight! Yummmm"}
{"text":"the pizza is very gross. tastes exactly like card board. except card board tastes better"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! They have great wings and pizza. Prices are very wallet friendly . Customer service rocks!! And they deliver beer!!! ;)"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing here. My friend brought me to this place and i have to say i am impressed. Price is good and so is the food."}
{"text":"The wings were excellent. I had the gourmet works pizza. I wasn't too thrilled with it, but it wasn't nasty. The service was great. And the place is clean. I would go back here!"}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best. Pizza is only good hot and loses its consistency as it gets cooler. 
Wings are your normal franks red hot and lucky if the big ones are cooked all the way.
I'd say look elsewhere even though they have friendly prices for the cheap."}
{"text":"Been here before for a kids pizza party/charity and it was awesome ..overall Pretty decent pizza and better wings! The littles loved the spaghetti!..a little on the expensive side though...$5 for bacon add on? Yikes....maybe I need to find a coupon next time..."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed here! Their food and service is beyond my expectations. The wait is never too long and this is totally a kid friendly place. I took my son and nephews here for lunch and the nice cashier brought them dough to play with. This is definitely a spot you want to check out. :)"}
{"text":"I can't get me enough of their wings. The pizza is pretty good but for me it's all about the wings. Wether it's honey BBQ or the buffalo style (in various temperatures), it's always a win with me. I started this review last week when I ordered some wings for delivery and not that I'm finishing it, I want to get some more. Mmmmmmm wings! :)"}
{"text":"2.5 for the pizza 3.5 for the wings 5 for the way it used to be... 

Let me take you back to 1988 on the corner of 19th Ave and Union Hills Rd. There was a Safeway, Walgreen's and Sardellas. They were the new kids to the hood. My wonderful Momz and I were next door getting some useless crap from Walgreen's and the hunger hit. Momz always liked a good pizza. 

We walk into a tiny 1 suite pad and ask for 2 slices of pizza. Mr Sardella (totally Broken English and all) said \" I'll-a give-a you-a a whole pie-a if ya tell-a me what-you think-a\" 

Momz was no dummy she raised 4 kids, pizza never went to waste. 

We get the whole pie and man was it chewy... no flavor and meh. 

She tells the guy and he starts yelling and hitting David Sardella, \" I tol-a you, you touch it too much-a\" It was the funniest thing ever. 

Momz ordered pizza from them for over 7 year EVERY Friday for Daycare and several more times a month for dinners. 

My wife ordered from there for almost 10 years EVERY Friday and for huge get togethers we would order Sardellas. BUT ALAS.... 

The pizza got stingy, no great flavor, no great appeal. In fact they are now serving Deer Vally School's the lunches on Monday Wed and Friday. Sardellas has become \"school lunch\" boo 

Go get a Garlic cheese bread and some wings but skip the pizza. 

They do serve the Deer Valley Schools well, always giving money or hosting events, and I thank them for continuing to give back to the community."}
{"text":"What can you say besides this is a great place with your typical pizza and wings. They have been a staple in the state since I was born and they are still going strong. I love the specials they run for pizza and wings and they have an awesome Monday night special on carry out right now as well."}
{"text":"I had three parties to host over the weekend. Based on my prior experiences, I looked no further than Sardella's. I scheduled with Garrett and Brittney and both took fabulous care of me. The orders were delivered on-time and exactly as ordered. I have yet to have a bad or even average experience with this location. Please keep up the good work! Thanks again."}
{"text":"I enjoy good bites for a cheap price.  This little hole of a pizza joint surprised me.  One large pizza for about $10 - almost as good as Little Caesars Hot-n-Ready!  Though I really liked their pizza.  The dough was doughy and the sauce was saucy - yum!  Service was okay, but it was like ordering from a fast food joint - is school out or SB1070 kicked out all the good workers??  My server looked like she was 12 - are we resorting to child labors now?  Anyways, decor was cheap and fast.  Looked like someone thought the 80's were back. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you like good pizza, with lots of taste and flavor, this is a place I'd avoid.   We ordered a pepperoni and mushroom original crust pie delivered.  Pizza arrived in good time, exactly as ordered, but it really lacked any flavor. Cheese was bland. Sauce was bland. Odd that even the pepperoni was flavorless. If you like food, I'd go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Our first experience with Saradella's was excellent and we will definitely be back. We are new here and our car is under the weather so we ordered delivery. The online order tool was easy to use, accurately estimated delivery time and provide multiple options for almost every dish ordered. We got a large cheese pizza with Alfredo sauce, spaghetti with Alfredo, garlic knots, side salad, soda, 6 cookies and 6 pack of beer. That's right they deliver beer and wine. Maybe this is a common thing here but for me it's new and was freaking awesome! Also I really love that they're responsible about it. The driver kept the beer separate until I had provided my card and DL and had signed for it. Easy! The driver was also very nice and professional!"}
{"text":"They have pretty good pizza & their wings are actually really good. The only complaint I have, is if you're ordering online and someone else is paying you need to show them your credit card and ID upon delivery. So, this means that your dad/girlfriend/mom/boyfriend cannot order food online if they're not there with you. If someone else orders it for you & they're let's say at work- they won't accept it."}
{"text":"Very welcoming and friendly service. The chicken wings were large, tender, and delicious. \"Traditional\" is essentially a mildly spicy Buffalo. \"Hot\" elevates that to about medium heat. I'd go back for the wings. They were REALLY good!

The pizza on the other hand was ok. Certainly not great or memorable but a little bland and just lacking any sort of hook to bring you back. It's not that it was bad, but with SO many places to get pizza, it's not keeping us from looking elsewhere.

A nice touch, however, was the chocolate chip cookie included in the pizza box. It sounds odd, and was definitely a surprise, but it was chewy, chocolately good!

We'll be back to Sardella's, but more for the wings."}
{"text":"The wings are just great at Sardella's! This time we tried the ravioli with meatballs too. Ravioli and sauce were delicious but the meatballs were unbelievable! The service is also great. We were given free garlic knots while we waited. A very nice touch."}
{"text":"So, after my negative feedback, it looks like wing delivery has improved greatly. The sauce no longer gets all over the delivery bag. The garlic cheesy bread continues to be delicious. Thanks for listening to me, Sardella's."}
{"text":"Super clean location! Food was fresh and really good! Great counter staff and really nice atmosphere! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have not written a review for this place yet. It is literally around the corner from my house and I have been quite often. The service is great and the pizza is delicious. Now granted everyone that calls Sardella's, I am sure  their number ultimately locked in but I always feel special when I call and  they are like \"Hey Eb, how are you? Are you getting your usual order\"? lol.  I especially love their Monday deals in which some of pizzas are 50%. Score! Although one of my favorites is a the large meat lovers for about $12 (not included in the Monday special) It is meaty and delicious! Lord knows how many times I have ordered that one.

So if you happen to be in the neighborhood and you are craving pizza and wings, stop in to this location. I promise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, most of the time. Just added pepperoni to a large pizza and literally got total of 12 pieces across 10 slices. Why so cheap?"}
{"text":"We had a veggie calzone w pepperoni added. A ceasar salad and garluc knots. Perfect dinner to accompany our baseball game! We didn't have to cook and the food was amazing! Loved this place!"}
{"text":"I give this 4/5 stars because the pizza was amazingly delicious however the wings are below average size wings. if I had a batch of a good sized wings it would've been 5/5.  Overall a great place to get pizza for a good price."}
{"text":"the pizza is pretty average. not as bad as Hut/John's/Domino's but not quality NY-style pizza. doughy. light on sauce. cheap food-service toppings.

wings were also average.

Slices are really small and not cheap. $9 for 5 wings and a tiny slice.

the rave reviews say more about the state of pizza in AZ than about this place."}
{"text":"The prices are reasonable. The pizza is good. It's a little on the greasy side. The atmosphere inside is nice. It's worth a try if you've never been."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from them for almost 8 years & have never had a single problem ever. the food is consistently good no matter what.the delivery is always on time,the staff friendly, it is simply great food with good people & I would recommend it to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Tasteless pizza and even the wings were terrible. We will never eat their food again. They used to be good but now,yuck!"}
{"text":"Ordered some Wings (hot & soooo tasty!) for delivery from the yelp app & they came very fast. Will be ordering again from Sardella's!"}
{"text":"Hello!

Today I ordered pizza and soda for my coworkers because...well why not! When I called in I accidently hung up on the girl and then when I called back a few min later she was still nice to me! The young lady on the phone was as kind and professional as can be, I was extremely impressed with her customer service skills. The pizza got here fresh and fast! I was beyond impressed with how quickly it made it here and it was go hot and cheesy and gooey and just delicious! The gentleman who delivered it was very friendly and well worth the tip! I just want to say I am overall impressed with this location and will definitely do business with y'all in the future!."}
{"text":"The staff is great and the food is even better. We've been twice since moving to AZ and each time the pizza was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I received a coupon in my email that advertised a large 3 topping pizza for $9.99. And the picture it showed was of a pizza that looked so good! Normally I would have deleted it immediately due to the fact that I am trying to be good and follow my WW plan right now. However last night I was in a bad mood (see my previous review of SimonMed) so I said \"Let's go for it!\" and we headed to Sardella's. This was the first time we had been there and we walked in and saw that you order at the counter and then find a seat. We decided on a pepperoni, sausage, and meatball. Now for those of you that know me you know this is totally different than anything I would normally order. Usually I'm an artichokes, sun dried tomatoes, and ricotta cheese gal. But that picture in the email beckoned me to order the meat and I'm so glad we did! This pizza was sooooo good!!!  The crust was perfectly cooked and it had just the right amount of sauce and all of the meats came together without being greasy and overbearing. And oh the wonderful cheese! So glorious! Once I decided I was blowing my WW for the night I decided to go all the way and splurged with boneless wings. So glad we did! We got the \"Bold Gold\" (or something to that effect) and they were delicious! Kind of a mixture of honey and mustard and slathered with plenty of sauce but still crispy. So yummy! Also, after we ordered and found our seat they brought us  garlic knots with pizza sauce to hold us over until our food came. How cool is that?! It was especially appreciated by this \"hangry\" gal! The servers were really nice and the D-backs were playing on the big screen. Definitely someplace we will return to and wondering why it's taken me so long to find it!"}
{"text":"We ordered 3 pizzas and one of them was so undercooked that it was inedible.  The mushrooms were canned and there was no flavor. The manager first hung up on me when I called and when I called back he had a major attitude problem and took no responsibility for the lack of quality control from his employees.  This place was a waste of money, do not waste your time, appetite, or money here. We will never order from here again."}
{"text":"If you're going to charge for ranch then it should be delivered and not attempted to be delivered 45minutes after I have already received my pizza. The fact that you guys are unable to refund anyone for a mistake you made with out putting two charges on their card is ridiculous. Whether you believe I am right, wrong, or indifferent, I am still a paying customer. I myself am a manager and the way I felt like the manager, Andy, handled this situation was not a way I would want myself or any of my employees to handle this situation. I understand it's the night shift and you all may not want to be there any longer or that my complaint was silly and irrelevant but what should have been a simple dinner for my children after a long day was a fight in a half. You are getting paid to make customers happy and to make your company proud which was failed at miserably tonight."}
{"text":"This place is no Papa Johns - thank goodness! Nice thin crust pizza, with lots of exciting toppings. Not overly greasy or cheesy or crusty, just a well-balanced yum. Enjoyed the blanco (white) pizzas with basil and garlic (add the artichoke) and also the chicken BBQ. Also LOVE the fact that they deliver! Thank you!!

PS- I totally forgot that I was eating a gluten-free pizza. WOW."}
{"text":"Great delivery time to our hotel. Amazing crust and delicious sauce on the pizza and wings. Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Great pizza. I prefer their deep dish pizza. Their wings are even better. The best time to go is for their lunch special. You cannot beat the lunch prices."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! My wife is sensitive to everything especially gluten. They're so transparent with ingredients and careful with handling gluten free items to ensure no cross contamination. A company who cares that much about their customers with needs deserves 5 stars! Thanks Sardella's and team."}
{"text":"Tried a pepperoni pizza. The pizza was just ok. I've had tastier pizzas at a better price elsewhere. Wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"The food is great, nothing mind blowing but great pizza and wings. What they get five stars for is their customer service! I called with my order in hand, and while trying to order 20+ family members walked in and out of the room I was in repeatedly changing the order. The cashier on the phone was very friendly and patient through the many, many revisions and kept making sure he had our order correct. When the order arrived, the delivery guy brought everything inside and helped me setup. He was super friendly as well (same guy perhaps?). To make the experience that much better, there was a warm hidden chocolate chip cookie, wrapped in foil under one of our pizzas that was so gooey and delicious! Every time we visit my in laws in Phoenix we will be ordering from Sardella's."}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza. Not the best in the world but light-years ahead of Dominos. On Mondays, pizza is 50% off when you dine in or carry out and it's a great deal. 

Their wings are mighty tasty too.

Can't say I recommend their Sicilian crust, but the hand tossed is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings!!! I always order Sardellas for a fight night and it's a hit Everytime."}
{"text":"Came for the first time. Tried to up charge me for everything because I had a coupon. Not polite management. Pizza was okay......gross pizza ever salad was old nasty ....."}
{"text":"Love this pizza so much. Nice thick cheese. Hand tossed crust. Always deliver quickly."}
{"text":"Love Pizza Monday 1/2 on any pizza ...... Pizza is good 
I have try the wings. But There on my list for Pizza Mondays
Busy place Order early..."}
{"text":"Yummy. Great pizza. Great guy took our order. It was a bit hot inside but it was 107 degrees outside. We will be back"}
{"text":"While the staff was very nice, the food was terrible.  Too much flavorless sauce, too much cheese (which is quite a feat), and the dough tasted worse than my elementary school's cardboard pizza boxes..."}
{"text":"Great pizza, huge calzone. First visit and definitely won't be our last.  Service was quick and helpful. The free garlic knots while we waited were a great bonus.  Everyone enjoyed what they ordered. Would recommend you check them out."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good little pizza joint! A friend of mine suggested I meet him here one day after work. I was expecting just average pizza, but I was surprised that it was actually pretty good. The strip mall this place is in looks a little seedy.  It's probably not the kind of place I would want to venture out to after dark, but the restaurant itself is clean and the people working here are nice. They serve beer here too (which is always a plus). I had a Blue Moon with my pizza (which usually goes better with burgers), but in this case went along pretty well with it. Next time I'm in the area I will have to stop by."}
{"text":"Great pizza and garlic knots!  Sardella's also has quick delivery as well. The prices can be expensive (especially if you build your own), but it's worth it. We ordered from Sardella's the other night, and the crust was delicious! I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza and chicken wings were delicious and delivered promptly by friendly delivery person. We are sure to order from here again."}
{"text":"I'm late posting this but have never forgotten how pleasant Melissa, was a couple months ago, with a phone order I placed. My friend had lost his wife and we wanted to have several pizzas delivered. She was extremely helpful and even gave us a discount which helped so very much. Her compassion touched us and everyone I told. Thank you Melissa. The pizza is always amazing and that day was no exception."}
{"text":"This has always been my favorite go to for wings.   Love the food.   They just lost a long time customer.    I just realized I was charged almost $50 for the mini ultimate special delivery.  Its usually around 30.  Watch your bank statement closely.   I guess the delivery driver decided to give himself a hefty tip."}
{"text":"Oh Sardella's how I love you!   The wings are crispy and spicy like no other! Jared is kind and helpful. The pizza is delicious and always hot. The delivery never disappoints.  It is the \"go to\" pizza delivery for this foodie family!"}
{"text":"When I moved to Phoenix, I received a welcome package with various coupons and freebies and among them was a coupon for a free medium 1 topping pizza to this location. I finally got around to getting to this part of time and decided to give this spot a try. Not a big pizza fan, but who doesn't like free?

Located at the corner of 43rd and Cactus in a shopping center next to Fry's grocery store. This spot is a small location. So wouldn't recommend coming with a large group of people as they only have about 15 tables and booths.

When you first come in, you put in your order and pay at the front before they bring out your food. Since I had the coupon for a free pizza, I let my guest get what they wanted, which was pepperoni. I'm not a fan of pepperoni so I just got me a single plain cheese slice along with a drink. 

Food came out within about 15 minutes and looked and smelled delicious!! The cheese pizza was amazing tasting. The cheese was fresh and they put plenty of cheese on their pizza. Even though I didn't have any of the pepperoni pizza, I was told that it was also very good. Crust is just the perfect thickness for me. Not too thin and not too thick. 

The restaurant itself looked pretty clean. Tables that weren't being used, were wiped down and chairs put in place. Floor did need to be swept and the drink station filled. 

Would come back again, but probably not any time soon as they seemed a bit high in price for the quality of food that I got. 

4 star for food flavor, freshness and the speed of which it came out.
4 star for customer service 
3 star for price of their food
3 star for cleanliness"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! The garlic knots were delicious and the tables were clean! The counter girl was super friendly and helpful with putting in our order. Also the wait was not long, got to catch up with the game on the big screen and enjoy the atmosphere of the space. Thank you for a wonderful meal we will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Lets start off by me just stating that I work very hard for my money, as most young women without parents do in order to make it in this economy. So I hardly ever order delivery. Yesterday I was at home sick and decided delivery would be a great help since I was too sick to cook.

Well, Sarabella's seemed to have good deals so I went with them. To start the whole bad experience, the lady who answered already had a bad attitude when I asked if she delivered to my apartments (I'm new to the area so I didn't know my cross streets). She was beyond annoyed with me. Then gave me that \"You're wasting my time\" attitude. I believe her name was Nicole or something. Not sure, but she wasn't worth my time remembering her name so we're even.  

After the very frustrating experience trying to put in a simple order, I hung up on her. Then my food arrived and it seemed it was just sloppily put together. To make it worse, every thing was stapled! What the hell? Like literally, I had to pull apart TEN staples just to get to my food! 

I ordered the spaghetti w/ Italian sausage, 5 wings, and a slice of pizza. I planned to have the wings and pizza for lunch then spaghetti for dinner... but then it turns out the pizza was as hard and cold as Nicole's soul, so of course that went into the garbage...

The wings were okay...not as good as Streets of New York, but okay. The spaghetti was pretty good though. A little on the sweeter side, but the Italian sausage made it all better. :) 

The only reason why I didn't give this place 1 star was because of guess who...the delivery driver. That's it. He was pleasant and had my delivery to my house 15 minutes early. Go Glen Coco! High five. 

Won't ever get food from here again. So I'd advise you to beware of poor service and the risk of being humiliated by the Wicked Witch of Sarabella's.

...Yeah it was that bad. No exaggeration needed."}
{"text":"Went to Sardella's last week for a pizza and spaghetti and meatballs, and I would recommend Sardella's for anybody looking for some good Italian food"}
{"text":"Very good food and a family friendly atmosphere.  Also one of the few places that makes affordable Gluten-free pizza."}
{"text":"Came for dinner as a party of 7. We had a coupon for 2 large cheese pizza & a 2 liter of soda for $20. Such a deal!! The pizza is great.. The crust is light & airy , the bottom is crispy and doesn't get soggy even after it sits for awhile. We also had an order of BBQ wings and extra hot wings. I LOVE  the way the wings are cooked. They are extra crispy but not breaded , they are tender & oh so flavorful."}
{"text":"We came from the other side of town and wanted to pick up some hot pizzas for our arrival at friends.  We pulled up 10 minutes before opening but decided to try the door.  They were incredibly gracious and told us it was not a problem at all. We had a couple beers while they made us 2 delicious hot pizzas.  Taylor was our cashier and as nice as could be.  The manager welcomed us warmly.  It is so rare to find this kind of service these days. We will stop here every chance we get and tell our friends!"}
{"text":"This has been our go to delivery place for over 4 years now but have to rate it lower after all this time because the last few times we ordered wings, something has obviously changed.  At first we hoped it was just a fluke but 2 subsequent orders shows the wings are now very different & a much poorer quality to them...very small/pettite bones, they break up & several are bent out of shape, (probably because they are so delicate now, they can't stand up to the cooking process), hardly any meat on them...they are so disappointing. I see in another review there was a change due to the \"toughness of the bigger wings\" - sounds like you need people that know how to cook them properly, nothing I ever ordered was tough!  While their pizza is the best, we are going to start going elsewhere for our wings. I can't say we'll still keep odering from Sardellas if we can't get decent wings there anymore :-("}
{"text":"We rang in a special order and at first they accidentally messed it up and after we brought it up they were so nice about it they gave my fiancé and I free drinks and they remade our order and gave us the messed up one as well! Highly recommend this Sardellas, great customer service and the food is phenomenal! Thanks Sardellas we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I'm glad  we have \"Sardella's\" in our neighborhood. Usually I buy pizza on the way home. It helps me on the busy day. I never dissapointed with the service(10-15 min waiting time, taste,quality and young & friendly staff. I'm  their customer since 2011..."}
{"text":"They USE TO have the best buffalo chicken Pizza but the last 2 times I've bought this Pizza it tastes like just a cheese and chicken Pizza. BEFORE, the pizza would be cut into little pieces and the Buffalo chicken was awesome.. I hope they bring back the old recipe because that's the only Pizza I would eat.!"}
{"text":"I would rather order from here than other places, even with the changes over the last year. Last year, I tried Sardellas for the first time and found it amazing! However, over the last year their pizzas have been greasier and their wings more soggy. I have now dropped Sardellas to a \"back up plan\" pizza night."}
{"text":"Neighborhoods best pizza. Been coming here since I could eat hard food. Square  slices + wings all the way."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great value. Been coming here for over 10 years, the workers always seem to be happy and the food always comes out great. I prefer square over triangles and the med wing sauce is one of my favorites. Great neighborhood pizza joint."}
{"text":"Sardellas used to be my go to pizza spot but not anymore. I'm not sure if their wings can get any smaller. They used to be a NORMAL size which made it worth paying $30 for but now the wings are so small and barely have meat on them. The only reason I don't give them 1 star is because the delivery drivers are always so nice. Sadly the decline of their food and rise of their prices had me going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sardella's is not what they were 15/20 years ago. No longer are the days when you would see the Porsche 911 with the license plate 'SPW' in the parking lot.  I'm sure the original owners sold out and have moved on to bigger and better adventures.

As stated, the pizza just isn't what it was before.  It seems under cooked, and all we usually get are thin crust cheese pizzas. I can't imagine how under cooked a pizza with additional toppings and a thicker crust would be with their way-quick oven conveyor.   

My suggestion to improve the product would be to slow down the oven conveyors.  You need to brown the cheese more on top.   We have to slightly dehydrate the product to concentrate the flavor like some major competitors are doing.    The sauce is good as it is, perhaps a pinch of sugar would help it out.  

However it's always crowded, the revenue is flowing in so I doubt the current owners/management will do much at this point

Anyway, until I can build a time machine and go back to 1996 I'll be heading to Barrows to get my pizza.   For A change up I'll also hit Pizza by Napoli, a review of which I'll do later.

I'll still hit Sardella's from time to time. And if the product improves I will come back and alter this review!

EDIT - 7/15/16 - Hit Sardella's a few times since the last review.  I still think they undercook their pizza but it seems to get better through the week.. not sure if they speed up the product on the weekends?   Well, none the less I'm upping their rating as the last time was pretty good (on a Tuesday night).   Keep pushing for a great product Sardella's...I am moving this to 3 stars but, honestly think 2.5 is where it's at."}
{"text":"A new York thin with pepperonis and onions and I'm in heaven. Add some wing an I'm over the top. The delivery is super fast too."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok in a pinch.   crust was thin but bland and I like pepperoni crispy which this was not.  Wing sauce hot barbecue was good but wings are very small"}
{"text":"So this piazza place was recommended To my family by the night shift guys at Holiday inn. No pervious experience here. Wow they blew us away. They had a nice large menu. Pizza, pasta, calzones , salads and deserts. Service was amazing. The girl taking our order was so happy and inviting. She can by after ordering and gave us garlic nots and pizza dough for the kids to play. Great pizza thank you"}
{"text":"Loved the pizza and delicious garlic knots! Service was amazing and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"OK, it's not the best pizza I've ever had, but with all of the competition around them, there is no competing, their pizza is the best. And with the constant promotions like half price Mondays, it's an easy dinner choice. It's way better than any big chain pizza, and the wings are good."}
{"text":"I ordered a meatball calzone to go. It was about 95 percent dough. One thin layer of cheese and maybe the equivalent of half a meatball smashed into crumbs in the middle. Ate half of it and threw the rest away."}
{"text":"From out of town staying at a local hotel.  Saw the Yelp ratings so I called and ordered a large \"works\" pizza and and 20 honey BBQ wings.  Delivery within the stated 45 minutes, hot and fresh.  Loved both the pizza and wings, great delivery option if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here a lot when I taught up this way.  I went to it awhile back, and the food is still wonderful.  I love family owned pizza places.  It always seems the food is a hair above the chains.  

The people that work there are friendly and laid-back and you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Pizza although good much of the time, needs salt added to the sauce. Otherwise you know that's what is missing. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Watched them prepare the pizza without gloves.  In the same 5 minutes of observation I watched them cross contaminate, wipe their hands on a dirty rag, pull their pants up and adjust their hat, then continue to sort the toppings and make the pies. I asked the front desk to confirm that this is their norm and she said it was \"they wash their hands\". It's specific in the food handlers card of Arizona on how to properly prepare food safely. I'd rather know then not know So I just won't eat here."}
{"text":"Best little pizza place. Delivery was fast and friendly. Pizza was hot and fresh for delivery."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and I'm from Chicago!!!   Simple clean restaurant.  Good food. Reasonable prices!!"}
{"text":"I normally love the pizza and service today was different there was no cheese on the pizza service wasn't so good and a couple of the wings looked like just bone I won't be coming back My dad had told me he had a bad order recently I should have listened to him .Its expensive for being the way it was"}
{"text":"Pizza and wings were okay but I ordered the special last night (Sunday night football opener) so it was very busy.  I expected to have to wait but they said to pick it up in 15 minutes but I came in and waited almost an hour.  I got frustrated but at least the game was on TV.  The place is nice inside but the ranch is not home made and the wings were average at best.  I am just not a big fan of Sardellas but I wanted to give them another chance last night."}
{"text":"Can't beat their Tuesday night cheese pizza special."}
{"text":"My family has always enjoyed their pizza and wings. Their ravioli and meatballs is one of our favorites. Their pizza is good and cheesy. Original crust is ok but I prefer thin crust. Now on to their wings. These minuscule morsels looked like they were off of a humming bird or something. Way to small to enjoy. While the sauce was good. Expect to work for your meal due to the size of their wings. Another poster said the same thing a month ago and got a response. Well, I think they forgot to upgrade their wing supplier. Will be back for sure, just not for the wings."}
{"text":"Sardella's is my new favorite pizza place in Phoenix. I visit frequently for business and always look for good pizza to try. I found this place on yelp and was very happy with my meal. I ordered a thin-crust meat pizza to go. Very god! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"my husband and i crave this place all the time! amazing pizza and wings. only negative is when ordering wings for delivery the sauce is everywhere- I hope the management sees this: I would suggest wrapping the wings in the paper and then in foil before placing it in the container :) otherwise everything is perfect!"}
{"text":"Delivery ordered for the first time. Easy online ordering, pizza arrived fast and super hot, the delivery guy had a smile on his face and the pizza tasted so good! Great experience. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because I requested and didn't receive plates and napkins as I had just moved into my home and nothing was unpacked yet."}
{"text":"I love their wings, they are the only wings I actually crave on the planet.  Pizza is pretty good too, but the wings are soooo good.  Good service, nice place."}
{"text":"So I got a med pizza with some wings. The wings were small, however not a lot of fat and the sauce was tasty, which was good. The pizza was good. I'm kinda a pizza snob lol real  in Italy is amazing and New York pizza and Chicago Pizza is good too. Here the Toppings are fresh, as well as the cheese. The sauce is ok. Overall not bad. I'd come back."}
{"text":"I've grown up being a fan of Sardella's and preferred it over any chain pizza joint. I've always enjoyed their fresh pizza and great wings."}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings are very tasty BUT maybe an quality control is in order. 3 of our slices of pizza had large bubbles in the crust. The wings are the tiniest ive ever seem but were good"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and wing delivery for our lazy Sunday at home. Wings were awesome, pizza was tasty, and we got a delicious cookie in the pizza box which was a nice little surprise!
My only thing would be for the drivers to have better hot bags for delivery - our delivery only took about 35-40 minutes, not bad, but when we got our pizza in the house and opened the box it was already pretty cold, so we had to reheat some pieces. Overall, good food as usual!"}
{"text":"It depends on the time of day that you order, if it's high traffic time frame it is Dowie pizza and needs to be re-cooked in your oven and that's not cool.. really, disappointing that you have to re-heat and finish cooking the soggy and doughy pizza delivered."}
{"text":"My pizza arrived HOT and the family went wild! There was an issue with the second pizza though. I called in and this team delivered! I had the right, hot pizza at my home within 19 minutes.  Got a problem anywhere else, good luck! Sardella's at 43rd and Cactus is world class
In our book!!!"}
{"text":"When you actually call in and order its actually more expensive then the prices on the menu. seriously!!! Update your menu its misleading."}
{"text":"Ordered a calzone and pizza.  Everything was  great, and exactly what we ordered.  The calzone was bigger than my head and I took at least half home.
 I also want to note this is one of the cleanest places I've been in.  There was a young staff member (sanjana) who was cleaning the entire time we were there..and not just moving around looking busy but paying attention to detail and getting it really clean. 

Shout out this place is great...we will be back."}
{"text":"So I really want to give this place 5 stars but I can't. Two simple reasons... 1. They are super expensive and 2. I was drunk AF when I ate here.

 Everybody knows that most foods are fantastic when you're drunk. 

Anyway we got the special with the pizza and wings and surprise surprise when we got home somehow there was a fantastic little cookie inside the box. I don't even know if it came from this pizza place but it was pretty great. 
Service was great. Poor cashier had to deal with some drunk girls but took it like a champ! 

I am about 98% positive I liked this place. I definitely recommend trying it sober...."}
{"text":"This is a dude paradise!  It's dark and lots of tvs are on so it's like a man cave.  The food is good bar food and if you want to have a few drinks with your friends in the dark then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Awesome Gluten Free pizza.  Never been \"glutened\" eating it.  I went to CA Pizza Kitchen and while I appreciate them having gluten free pizza the taste was nothing compared to Sardella's.  We are so thankful they are around and go to the extra trouble of doing Gluten Free so that we can all eat out as a family."}
{"text":"Loved my spaghetti with meatballs.  Others had calzones.  Only comments...would have preferred traditional garlic bread with spaghetti instead of garlic knots but daughter loved garlic knots.  Son-in-law paid $1 extra for olives in calzone but they forgot.  Great way to get Italian food other than pizza after restaurants have closed.  I ordered extra meatballs and I had enough for left overs the next day.  Reheated spaghetti sauce was even better."}
{"text":"I am happy that much of the menu can be ordered gluten free.  The gf boneless chicken wings rock!  The gf garlic cheese bread is my GO TO.....instead of getting the pizza.  It's $7 vs. way more for the ZA first off.  It's made with Gluten Free Creations crust either way...and the pizza sauce is  boring and toppings are bland.  Stick with the cheese bread with it's cheesy, garlicky goodness and you'll be fine.  Also the salads are fresh and a good value.

I suggest telling them to cook the gf crust options a little less because they tend to arrive a bit overdone.  They carry so much gf due to a family member being gf.  Just wish they (and many others!) would do their own gf crust (like Picazzo's) because the GFC crust is okay but not WOW!  BUT I'm soooooo very glad they carry so much GF!

The regular items are usually a hit at our house too.  The thick crust gets rave reviews."}
{"text":"My husband and I order pizza often when we need some great pie and wings. We have been coming here for a little over 20 years and we still enjoy their pizza."}
{"text":"I Go to this Sardella's location quite often for lunch. Pizza is always piping hot and very good when you order slices. Very affordable too.  No reason not to give 5 stars. Place has had a spot in my pizza rotation for many years and will not doubt continue to do so! Thanks guys..."}
{"text":"Good pizza, cheese and sauce were tasty. We've been looking for a good thin crust pizza close to home and this is the best we've found so far. We ordered delivery and it was very timely and hot when it arrived. The only disappointment was we were hoping for squared cut slices like we were used to for a thin crust pizza back in IL. The warm cookie was a nice surprise and delicious!"}
{"text":"Always loved this place growing up and still do! Awesome service by some kind and considerate people. I love the value meal deals, just right for me!"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza, super doughy, too it off with some rubbery cheese. Can say won't be going there again..."}
{"text":"Good food, good service! We are here weekly!!! My fiancé loves the pizza! I love the hot wings! We even dip our pizza in the hot sauce! And the cunnabread is to die for! It is so cheap but so big! We always end up bringing it home! And their pizza fries are  delicious i just feel they need more cheese. Also the garlic knots are amazing! Our food tonight was so perfect, smoking hot, super delicious, and we left full and happy! Thanks sardellas! You are a great, Godly company! You'll have our business forever!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been eating here since we were little and they first opened. We lived in the neighborhood behind. Every Friday my parents would order and it was the best. They used to have super big wings back in the day, but everything literally still taste the same. All the neighborhood kids would walk up and eat Sardellas in the summer and then walk to Water and Ice for ice cream. I'm sure the kids still do it. Our teacher Mrs. Wilber at our middle school used to have her son bring her pizza at the school because he worked there or he would just bring it just because he loves his momma but I remember all of us would get so jealous and then the school partnered with them to serve pizza for our school lunch some days which was awesome because everyone loves Sardellas. They even sponsored my dads football teams back in the day which was so cool. We don't get to eat here often because we live out in Anthem but they never disappoint when we do eat. Best pizza, wings, and memories! Amazing staff too!!!!"}
{"text":"Really I should give this restaurant one star the pizza wasn't that great more bread then anything the lady who took the order was Donna beware of Donna she is not friendly at all her face even shows it I'm surprised she even works with the customers with an attitude like hers!!"}
{"text":"First time going here tonight. The wings were tiny but so fricken good!! And their wing sauce was amazing! The Mediterranean salad was delicious, with olives & artichokes. The original crust pizza was alright. It was very greasy in the center and made the crust soggy. Sadly I feel like that is how it is at most pizza places in AZ."}
{"text":"YUM! We came on a Wednesday night and it was a party in here! Almost had a line out the door, and every table was full. 

We are super impressed with the level of professionalism and customer service by all that work here.

Now the pizza, YUM. We got the Mediterranean without broccoli and it was delicious. Very authentic tasting, and more than enough to share. Only thing I would do differently next time is add more kalamata olives ;) 

Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I am a pizza lover - nothing like dough and cheese with great sauce! I like alllll kinds of pizza except this pizza. I not only hated this pizza I rendered it inedible! The sauce was gross tasted like salsa without the heat. The cheese was rubbery and not tasty @all. 

We also got a calzone that was disgusting- filled with ricotta cheese that made it soggy - no mozzarella inside just ricotta cheese and more of the gross sauce :/ the veggies were not great either. 

We also got garlic knots and wings - I did enjoy them but I'm not sure that I liked them because they were good or everything else was so bad that it made those 2 items taste ok? Seriously. 

In all this was a real bummer of a food experience. I was hoping to find a neighborhood gem but just found a neighborhood bust. Not to mention how expensive the bad food was - I will not be a future customer and I highly recommend trying any other pizza place."}
{"text":"These pizzas used to be really good.  Great sauce and a nice thin crust.  Now the sauce has no taste and the crust is thick and doughy.  Can't tell the difference between the box and the pizza.  Pass on this one Wal Mart has a better pizza in the frozen aisle."}
{"text":"Usually okay. But have had a couple mis-deliveries. Very accommodating in giving us credits at least. Hubby went to order a takeout order and asked for gold fever hot wing sauce on their buffalo chicken pizza (in lieu of traditional). They said they couldn't do it, but that seems like it should be a pretty easy replacement.... so I'm not super impressed. Will give it three stars."}
{"text":"Sardella's is perfect for anyone that wants decent pizza for super cheap.  I would imagine this place would be especially great for big families that want to treat their kids to pizza night without having to spend $40.

A large here is only $8.99 and it's 16 inches.  That's a lotta inches if you know what I mean.  I'd say the pizza was pretty good for such a low price.  And if you decide to eat in, a slice only costs you $1.50 or so.  You order at the counter, and decor is very minimal so there's no atmosphere or 'mood' at this place, but it's nice to have the option for quick, tasty pizza that costs next to nothing. This would be a good choice for a quick lunch hour meal if you work nearby!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Sardella's since I was a teen.  Having my high school serve Sardella's pizza as a regular lunch item everyday further reinforced it.  I've order from different locations through out the years and the Cactus location is now my main one.

The delivery times are always on point and the food is tasty as ever.  I had made a big order last night for dinner at my house with my in-laws and one of the items was a 20 order of traditional wings.  As I was unpacking, the wings container and bag it was carried in was just soaking wet with sauce.  It had all leaked out and left my counters and my hands all a greasy, saucy mess.  I was so upset that this wasn't more cared for during delivery, especially after leaving a nice tip!  I was surprised that the wings had any sauce left on them after so much leaked out.

The in-laws said it was still very good and even had a slight spiciness to them.  Having them enjoying it made up for the mess.  I will still continue to order from here even after this mishap."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy calling sardellas. They know my name Wenger they answer the phone. Great food and I feel like I'm at cheers."}
{"text":"Delivery was fast, but the pizza was tasteless and tough. Cost too much for the poor quality. And the wings were just okay.. plus the bag and container were completely covered in sauce, it was such a mess!!! Never again :( what a waste of $40.."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Sardella'a for a while.  I always see their coupons in the mail but never been too interested to check them out.  After a sad departure of Carusotti's which was one of the better pizza joints in the area, and now that Lucky's isn't what it used to be, I decided to try Sardella's.

I ordered pizza and wings.  The wings are available in your typical range of spiciness, however Sardella's fortunately has \"Suicide\", which is always a plus.

I ordered the wings extra crispy, however they were not delivered extra crispy, rather just well done.  That was actually fine by me, as long as they were cooked enough so the skin doesn't taste rubbery.  The sauce was really good.  Sometimes \"suicide\" wings are just lacking in flavor but extremely hot - these were very spicy, but also had strong pepper flavors.    There were also visible flakes of red chilis present on the wings.  All in all I was very happy with the taste, and my head was definitely sweating enough to give me satisfaction.  

The pizza was not bad, however it was rather average.  The hand-tossed crust tasted very similar to a Domino's style crust - somewhat spongey and neither very thick or thin.  The crust edges were rather large, and if you like having \"breadsticks\" with your pizza, this may have been a bonus for you, but for me, I like a less present crust edge.  As a plus, the ingredients were very good and tasted fresh.  Despite this though, the sauce was not too impressive or memorable.    

All in all I thought they delivered a good pizza that would easily beat your typical pizza delivery, however nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"great place, staff and food, plus 50% off every monday on pizzas and toppings."}
{"text":"I use to be a BIG Sardella  fan and the staff is always wonderful.. I ordered 4 pizzas for two growing boys.  When I got home from work there was 3  1/2 pizzas left.. I could not believe they would send pizza out looking the way they did.. Hardly no cheese and the cheese was burnt again.. I was told a while back they had a problem with their ovens.  I guess they are still broken.  Sorry I will not be coming back too many strikes.
:("}
{"text":"Make sure you order more wings than you think you can eat cause their lil bitty wings that cost more than a dollar a piece will not fill you up  they ain't worth more than a quarter now I remember why I stoped going there  my girls say at least the ranch is good"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time because we had a coupon for a free pizza so we figured we would try it out. Usually when you get a coupon like this you feel obligated to buy other stuff and spend a ton of money, but they had great specials and reasonable prices. We ordered our food, only spending 7 dollars and sat down to wait. Next thing we know they brought us raw pizza dough for the kids to play with, which they loved, and free garlic knots. The food was delicious and the staff was helpful, friendly, and very kind. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I absolutely looooove this place!! The food is not just great but they always have the best deals going on. My family and I love their buffalo wings! We go here all the time and can't get enough of it! Way to go Sardella's!! We will be long time customers!"}
{"text":"My experience with the Sardella's staff was pretty horrible. I tried ordering online and somehow, my address got mixed up with someone else's and it took about two hours for my pizza to arrive. When it eventually did, it was pretty cold. The manager ended up giving me credit back but only after I asked for it. What made the interaction especially horrible was that no one was willing to take responsibility for the mixup. He just kept asking me if I was sure that I put in the address correctly. I was confident that I had because I kept the receipt. To top things off, the driver ended up asking me the same question as well and blaming me for putting him off track with all of his other orders. What a nightmare..."}
{"text":"I love Sardellas! It's lunch specials are quick but delicious and well priced. The pizza is more authentic pizza too. I'm not a huge fan of the pasta, but their pizza makes up for it :)"}
{"text":"Quick update -awhile back Sardella's asked Social Media (facebook if I recall) what toppings we'd like to see added to the choices. Many of us voted for artichoke hearts. Lo and behold, not two weeks later I could order them on my pizza, even online ordering got updated. Nice to see a business that interacts and reacts quickly with their clientele and has a responsive web design/social media team."}
{"text":"Average pizza, decent prices and service. The garlic knots are tasty and are a great start. Make sure to look for specials to save money. 

Staff keeps their restaurant clean."}
{"text":"I remember eating this pizza everyday at Barry Goldwater in high school as they had it for lunch at the cafeteria.  The pizza is really good and is definitely worth checking out, as it's not too pricey."}
{"text":"I order pizza and pasta for my family tonight. It took over an hour to get here and pizza did not fresh and was cool to touch.

I refused the order and asked the store to remake it and send it our fresh.

What was strange, was the GM calling me and telling me did I know that I did not pay for the first pizza when delivered??

I asked him would he pay for a pizza that was not hot or meet his expectation. He said no. So, I ask him why he would expect someone else to do so.

Then he asked why I would refuse the pasta. I explained that it would be nice for the family to all eat a hot meal together. And, again

would he have part of his family eat while the rest waited another 30-40 minutes for their food to arrive.



I was not expecting a call like this. If anything, I was expecting a call that said sorry for the delay and we are getting your new order out fresh right away.

Instead, David, (who if he is your GM, is even more disturbing), call me and made me feel as if it was my fault and that I should have paid for something that

was definitely below prior expectations and experiences with your company.

If any thing, your GM should have been calling to explain why the food took so long to arrive and why it was not hot.



This phone call was beyond inappropriate and definitely ruined our family dinner. I usually would not take time to write this to you, but as a business owner, felt you should

be aware of your employee/management and how your company is being portrayed. (I would like to know the same if my employees were acting similarly).

In any case, we will not utilize your services in the future."}
{"text":"My boyfriend treated me to pizza and wings here about a week ago. OMG, the wings were so good and the pizza was supberb as well. The staff was very friendly. He placed a pick-up order on the phone for about 40 wings and a pizza and it was ready as soon as we walked in the door. I do plan on eating here multiple times in the future."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium works pizza with half of it pepperoni only for delivery as I am staying at a Condo nearby. We are on vacation and the Consiere  recommended them. The delivery was about 39 minutes directly to my door. Pizza was about a C rating. Could have cooked a little lingers! A little pricey also, $16 for a medium pizza. I will not reorder."}
{"text":"My family and I ordered here on Friday night. I got the thin crust pepperoni. We also go a ricotta and sausage on the regular crust and an order of cheese bread. The pizzas are a little smaller then I expected. We ordered medium pizzas and they seamed like personals. The thin with the pepperoni was just what I was craving! The cheese bread was also awesome and I had that the next day. The thin crust was better in my opinion but it just depends what you are looking for. They also delivered which was super helpful. They said it would be an hour and it got to my house in about 35 min! We ordered online and there system was easy to use. The delivery guy was very nice! We will be back for their pizza. If you are close by and want some good pizza that delivers this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I take huge offense to someone recently posting that the employees are rude.!! This is the one of the very few places that I honestly feel that the employees are happy to be at work...well, maybe not happy to be at work, but they are consistently very cheerful, very attentive and they go out of their way to ask if everything is okay. They even arrive to take away your trays and trash. I have mentioned in previous reviews how impressed I am with the staff!!! I have even said that one can go in grumpy and leave happy because the employee vibe will rub off on you!! In a previous review to that one, I mentioned how happy the employees are on a consistent basis because it is true and noteworthy!!

Like another reviewer stated (and I have stated before) their buffalo pizza is excellent!! I do recommend ordering extra chicken because we like it with extra chicken. Their spaghetti and meatballs are really good! The star are the meatballs! I like the texture and the meatballs have a hint of sausage flavor. YUM!! The wings and pizza are outstanding too!! 

We have been going to this Sardella's location for many years. Never does it disappoint!!"}
{"text":"It's been years since I have had the opportunity to enjoy Sardella's. Went to the 43rd avenue and Cactus location and dined in. The pizza and wings were perfect! All of the staff was extremely friendly and appeared to enjoy their work. It was a nice to see the recipe hasn't changed and brought back memories from childhood dining on the wonderful treat."}
{"text":"I found the food here to be comparable to the food you might get at a Chuck E Cheese or something similar. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't super great, and it reminded me of the kind of food I used to get as a kid at event places. The pizza was tasty, but it was a little doughy, completely smothered in cheese, and light on the sauce. While I enjoyed it, it was a little blah. I got the boneless wings with the spicy BBQ sauce, and my boyfriend got the medium hot wings (bone-in). I was very disappointed that my boneless wings came with the sauce on the side, which left me with the feeling that I was eating chicken nuggets from McDonald's. I'm not the biggest fan of bone-in wings, but my boyfriend let me try some of his, and they were pretty good. Last, but not least, we tried some of the famous garlic knots that are supposed to be oh-so-good. In my opinion, they were undercooked bland pieces of dough slathered in some form of fake butter with bits of garlic sprinkled on top, in my boyfriend's friend's opinion, they were the best thing on the table....so to each his own, I suppose."}
{"text":"Love the management ... they run a quality establishment!  Pizza is tasty, restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly and helpful :-)"}
{"text":"I was tired of the same old pizza places and decided to finally try Sardella's.i ordered a medium thin with pepperoni and some garlic knots. I would have given a five star, but the amazing cookie smashed into my pizza and took half the slices topping. 

The pizza is really good, I haven't had this kind of pizza since I moved here from Wisconsin six years ago..it was cheaper than pizza hut and Rosati's. I will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I love their Sicilian Style pizza, so very delicious! Also the barbecue wings they have are fire every single time! I've been coming here for over 7 years now and always had a fantastic experience. The dining room is big and comfortable and they always have great music choice ! Keep up the great work Sardelas! God Bless You"}
{"text":"We have gotten pizza from here a few times. It is super simple ordering from them. They do actually flip the pizzas the, not roll through a machine like the chains ones do. I don't know why, but I like my pizza flipped not just squished. That's me. The pizza prices are very reasonable and the ones we have ordered hate tasty. My wife did order some boneless chicken wings, once. This is what kind of killed it for me. They looked like nuggets or something similar. Frozen nuggets. They give you containers with the sauce in them, not on the chicken. That was a huge blow for me. I will not order their chicken wings ago. I will stick to my regular place for wings. With that said we still order their pizza. There has not been a bad pizza. The staff there is friendly, from the time we call on to order and the time we get there and pay and leave. Will keep ordering their pizza unless we find something better."}
{"text":"While the wings are okay, the pizza is really sub par. Don't order thin crust, they have no idea what they are doing. Most times it's overcooked and the dough isn't right for thin crust. The last pizza I ordered was mostly bubbles and very little cheese, most of which was on one side of the pie. That was their last chance. See uploaded picture for proof."}
{"text":"Disappointing, I ordered a gluten free pizza and wings last night. Pizza took a little over an hour to get, once it arrived it was cold and so hard. The wings however where very good."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this place or not. Just because it looked like it was some kind of hole in the wall, to be honest. But it was really good. I had the vegetarian pizza. With no olives. Very fresh. I liked it."}
{"text":"Excellent service, delivery time and food quality! I was expecting a much longer time due to Superbowl schedule figured they'd be busy but no my order was out to me within 25 mins. I will say the prices are a little high but well worth it! Delivery driver polite and friendly! Seemed to like his job"}
{"text":"Wings were good but the blanco pizza with artichoke hearts and chicken was outstanding. Will be returning for a second round."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their pizza. Ordered on a Tuesday and the girl informed me it was buy 1 get 1 free that night. Total score! 14.00 for 1 lrg pepperoni and 1 lrg cheese. Going to try the bianca pizza next time."}
{"text":"Mostly good but often we ask for 'naked' wings and they are overcooked. This happens even after asking them not to."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in 30 minutes before close  one evening. We ordered a large veggie pie with 1/2 side add sausage. The motz was minimal and mediocre. The sausage tasted like pre-packaged crumbles. The mushrooms were artificial and straight out of a slimy can. The crust was under cooked and forgettable. The only ingredient that was worth a darn was the sauce.  I've baked far superior pies in my own oven and they came from a freezer. They are usually really good witch is why i'm disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in town to date! I love their wings as well! Great thin crust pizza, friendly, fast service."}
{"text":"I usually love Sardellas but tonight I called in to order a Buffalo Chicken pizza and I got home to find nothing but dry chicken and barely any cheese on my pizza with absolutely no sauce. I'm extremely disappointed. Working in a restaurant they should know better and know to check their product before putting it in a box and giving it to someone to take home. Thanks for wasting my $16"}
{"text":"Saredella's Ultimate.  Memories of a time gone by.

Back in the late eighties, my high school friends and I would hold regular Thursday evening get togethers to watch Married With Children and The Simpsons on the fledgeling Fox network.
...and we always ordered a Sardella's Ultimate:
Large Cheese Pizza and 50 wings for 11.99 (back then).

Oh sure, they still sell pizza, and they stil sell wings, but over the years they've gone from a super fresh neighborhood REAL pizza parlor (this is THE original location) to a generic, uneven quality \"local-chain\" of pizza stores. 

No fancy ingredients: the last time I tried to get a Hawaiian style, they had no Canadian bacon, only ham, not as slices, but tiny diced bits with a yucky flavor, and just as oily as pepporoni would have been, anyway.  No artichoke or banana peppers or anything like that either.

On the positive, they do have cheap deals, and are regular sponsors of local kids' sports teams and other community stuff.  I remember getting a coupon for a free medium pizza when I moved into my house.

I wish the Sardella's family continued success, but hope that someone within recognizes that their restaurants just aren't what they used to be."}
{"text":"We just moved to this side of town, and got a coupon for a free medium pizza. Decided to try it out tonight. Kayla took our order when we walked in, she was friendly. We got a medium pepperoni, 6 hot wings, and a drink. After our free pizza coupon, we paid $9.49. Food came out super quick, and was very good. My boyfriend is picky about his wings, but he says they were cooked well, and the buffalo sauce was good. We also received free garlic knots, which was awesome. We were very pleased with the food and the service. We'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Great spot, friendly service. I usually come here for the pizza since its close to home. They throw in a cookie w your order sometimes, too. One time we dined in, they offered some garlic knots. How did we get so luckyyy! Cookies w pizza!"}
{"text":"I tried their delivery for the first time. It could not have been easier. The pizza was on time and delicious. Even included a cookie for dessert.
The pizza was hot and fresh and the delivery guy was very nice and thanked me for the tip. I will definitely order from Sardella's again.


Very convenient!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and only for the round pizza, not realizing they also had Sicilian after reading Zack's review. I have to say, this is really bland, poor-quality pizza. There's just no taste or flavor. It's cheap, I guess you get what you pay for. Pizza by Napoli on 35th is much better."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and their pizza fries for pick up tonight. Ordered pizza at 7:12pm. Email says it takes about 20 mins. Get there about 7:40ish. The girl says we're just waiting on the fries. Oook. Fast forward 20 mins after seeing people come and go. I ask where our order is at. She says matter of factly: \"I gave your order of fries to the wrong order and he's remaking them now.\" Not an apology nor did they think to tell me this. Now I'm irritated. Fast forward ANOTHER 15 MINUTES...HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE FRIES?? The manager (believe or not) calls my name finally. I asked why did this take so long, it has been well over an hour after I ordered.  Mumbled something about the fries, again no apology. I asked him has our pizza been sitting there this whole time then, getting cold?? He said \"well it should still be FAIRLY warm but I can make another one for you\" -_-. After waiting so long I didnt want to wait another hour for warm pizza...and so that my fries would get cold anyway. On top of all that I paid for ranch...of course they didn't give it to us and I had to ask for them. Got home, pizza was stone cold. Never again Sardellas!!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Not the same as it was 20 years ago. Not the same from 10 years ago. Don't something different, and it just isn't as good. Better than a lot of other places in the area though."}
{"text":"Love Sardellas! Today's visit stood out because of Alex's and Casey's hospitality. They are both awesome ladies! Look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"The calzone I ordered was pretty good. But I wanted to sit quietly, in a restaurant. However, AFTER I ordered and paid, I found out that the ice machine was broken. I got the refund on the drink, got the food to go, and ate it in front of my drooling dog. But I only sat there 17 minutes waiting for my food. So.... probably my last time for a while."}
{"text":"We were driving in from CA, coming in to visit our friends in AZ.  We got hungry, wanted to grab a bite to eat.  We saw their billboard, which attracted us to check it out.  We pulled up, there were no cars parked in front and they had no customers.  We took a chance anyways. They had a large selection on their menu which was a bit overwhelming to stare up, while the cashier guy just stared at the 4 of us looking clueless.  We would've appreciated some offer of assurance or suggestions.  We ended up getting two large pizzas, and one order of boneless wings.  Don't bother getting the boneless wings cause you might as well just go to McDonalds to get their McChicken nuggets!  Thy didn't look like wings at all.  The buffalo chicken BBQ was a bit on the spicy tangy taste, so I had to pass on that. The other pizza we had there was tomatoes & cheese.  It's def a local pizza joint, they got busier later on.  The pizza was alright, made our hungry tummies content for the time being."}
{"text":"The best buffalo chicken pizza!! That's all I have to say.  it's my go-to place for that! Always sooo good"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great Staff.  The food is excellent.

I enjoy the water feature inside the restaurant, and the music they play over the speakers is positive and encouraging music."}
{"text":"Got the works pizza on a Monday to try the place out for half price.  We really wanted to like it, but the pizza is truly lacking, toppings were not even or abundant.  It would be hard to pay $19(full price) for a pie that weak.  Needless to say we'll try the place again."}
{"text":"My dad used to take me to sardellas after going to the dentist. Always good memories here. In glad to see they are be arching out. And the pizza is good too!"}
{"text":"This was the worse week for ordering Pizza from here. Pizza this week both times not enough cheese, cooked to long blowout holes where there
We're no toppings, brought the wrong beer. I usually buy from 1-3 x a week. Time to switch.

{"text":"We came in to try a new pizza place, and it was decent. We ordered a couple slices of pizza in which the man at the counter helped us save a couple bucks by making it a deal combo. Not only this, they also brought out some complimentary garlic knots which was great! Not too bad of an experience for a first time. The pizza was good, wasn't anything too WOW! but the boneless wings were soo good! Overall, would definitely come back again for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"For the price, the pizzas is pretty good. A WHOLE lot better than Dominos, which costs about the same. Their wings are good too. Unfortunately they raised prices recently. Wings are a bit on the high side but the pizza is still competitively priced. Still pretty good pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty important to me.  Not just because I enjoy it but also because I don't have a car and live at an intersection with no real stores/restaurants nearby (One can only get their food from Circle K just so often!)  So pizza is an ideal option because they deliver and since I'm \"Working Poor\", a larger pizza can last several days.

But the major chains are all hopeless.  I refuse to order from Domino's as I've boycotted them for a long time.  Pizza Hut has demonstrated they can't be trusted with personal banking info as they've overcharged my card and have yet to make things right.  And then there's Papa John's which is in a class all its own for reprehensible customer relations - I actually received a homophobic email from Phoenix Director of Operations Christina Carter actually telling me to take my business elsewhere because they didn't want people like me as customers.  Even after notifying both the local store and national HQ, I have yet to receive an apology from anyone or acknowledgement that the company doesn't condone such actions.

So I've been actively looking to more support our local businesses especially where pizza is concerned.  Sardella's has been a regular staple of the Valley since I moved here in the late 80s.  I've been enjoying sampling their various types of crusts.  Their wings are excellent - if you're a fan of suicide wings, they don't disappoint!  Plus they have all sorts of alternate selections including cookies (including white macadamia - my favorite!!) and salads!  They even have other types of pasta like spaghetti, ravioli and chicken parmesan for extra variety.  Their delivery drivers are continually prompt and some of the friendliest I've ever experienced.  I'm generally very happy with their food and have enjoyed getting re-acquainted with them after my horrible experiences with the major chains.

There are however some serious drawbacks.  Remember those great salads they offer?  They cost JUST below the minimum required order amount so if you want to eat healthy, you're outta luck as you have to order something else to accompany it if a salad's the main thing you're wanting.  

They do have specials but they aren't that...well...special.  If you're ordering for a larger crowd there may be some good deals but if you're just a single poor schmo like me there aren't any kind of discounts or deals you can really use.  Their newest special is the Monday Special where you can get 25% off any pizza...but it's only valid for dine-in or pick-up only.  So that leaves its transportation challenged customers like me out in the cold.  Given that their delivery fee is extraordinarily high, they really should be offering more specials to benefit the delivery customers that they're taking advantage of.

Let's talk a bit more about that delivery fee - by the time you add sales tax and that humongous fee to your actual order, even the cheapest possible order ends up being prohibitively high.  I used to have a Tuesday Tradition where I'd order pizza every week to accompany the viewing of my favorite show - but I can no longer do this on a weekly basis because it costs too much to order from them.  And the value of the size of your order compared to how much you end up paying for it just frankly isn't that worth it in the long run to order from them too regularly.  Bye bye, Tuesday Tradition (unless Circle K has a DiGiorno!)

So while I'm happy to support local businesses and recognize that sometimes they do cost more, they certainly don't make it easy or desirable to be a regular customer.  I haven't even touched upon some of the more minor nitpicks like how each extra topping costs more than they really should; if you want to be gluten free, you have to pay extra through the nose; and how they only offer 2 liter drinks.  Or how you're basically paying a dollar per wing if you order wings.  

So they do a lot of stuff right, but their pro's or too imbalanced compared with their con's.  They have the basic foundation in place to be a superior local business but they need to seriously reevaluate many parts of their business model."}
{"text":"We are visiting the city, staying in a hotel.   We got in late after most restaurants were closed, so decided to order pizza for delivery to the room.  Sardella's pizza was here in less than 30 minutes, along with plates, napkins, and cups for our drinks.  The lady who answered the phone was very courteous and helpful.  The pizza was great, although my wife thought it was just a little too greasy for her taste.

The delivery driver was polite and nice to my young son who insisted on handing him his tip.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Omg Sardellas you've given me a reason to start eating pasta with \"red\"sauce again your pasta and garlic knots are awesome!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks Sardellas"}
{"text":"I went with my cousins, my lil bro, my aunt and my mom. We got amazing service. It's hard to find a place to take four high energy boys where we can get great service, good food, and a great value too. I got a deal that included a large pizza and chicken wings. The pizza dough was well proofed with cheesy goodness and tasty sausage. The pizza isn't fancy or fusion. It tastes like good American pizza, the kind the ninja turtles would stop fighting the shredder over. And the wings were so tasty. And the were all wings and no drums, which any wing enthusiast would say are the best because they are most moist with more meat on them. And the ranch sauce was good too. I would normally save a five star for a restaurant that likes to push the culinary limits, but this place knows what they are doing and they are doing it great."}
{"text":"Sadly, last month I had a car accident that allowed me the increased usage of food delivery as a life necessity being carless. I have been using the YelpEats app and Sardella's is one of the participants in my area. They also have a lower minimum order amount. I had not had Sardella's in years. 

I have been ordering varied things off their menu and I have been very happy with the items I have ordered. Their salads are really good. In fact, the Spinach salad is quite Delish! 

Today I order the side order of Chicken Parm with garlic knots. It actually is pretty decent for a chain. So what is really a random comment here is going to be about their cookies. Wow, what a surprise! Their chocolate chip cookies are the bomb!

Delivery is great. All times they have been very early, almost half the quoted time. The delivery workers have been very, very, friendly and efficient. Thanks Sardella's. 

Oh yeah, thanks Sardella's, thanks a lot. Now that jingle is stuck in my head."}
