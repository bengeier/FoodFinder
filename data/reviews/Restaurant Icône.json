{"text":"This menu is the work of a truly inspired chef. This was easily one of the best meals I've had this year and quite possibly one of my top ten for the decade. The reason is that the chef understands nuance and flavor profile at an extremely high level. Combining bolognese, lobster, and bottarga created something entirely original yet perfectly natural at the same time. I could say the same thing about smoked tuna and cured pork cheek, seared tuna in a BLT, pickled beets and peaches in a savory ricotta tart, or hay ice cream with chocolate mousse. Icone is a foodie's dream restaurant."}
{"text":"We were a group of 10.  The restaurant was empty (with the exception of about 4 other middle aged woman dinning).  This was surprising to us for a Saturday evening.  They told us that they were re-opening that weekend and their menu was limited in terms of their house made juices (I think that's what she said?).  We were all very hungry and waited probably 45-60 minutes for our food.  They sat us by the window and we started to get cold.  They gave us white and olive bread while we waited.  She did tell us that the fried chicken entree would take 25 minutes.  Our food was very good.  The best meals ordered were the Contre-filet 10oz / 10oz Sirloin and the Demi-Poulet Frit / Half Fried Chiken.  People were not fans of the Papardelles au Lapin de Stanstead / Papardella with Stanstead Rabbit.  The price was reasonable and the atmosphere was fun and hip.  I recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Closed???? We went six months ago and were in food heaven. Decor needed some updating but after I started eating I went blind! Please reopen!!!!"}
{"text":"This was the highlight of our trip to Montreal. It was amazing how nothing sounded like it should go together but the meal flowed perfectly. We were one of only three tables in the restaurant. I really do not understand why it wasn't busier. Service was amazing and food was outstanding."}
{"text":"Amazing food with a chill ambient air.  Better yet was the food.  My wife and I started with the perfectly char grilled octopus appetizer.  The octopus was like a succulent piece of heaven.  Then we had the scallop risotto and rabbit pasta w/ shaved foie gras.  The scallop risotto dish was the best risotto dish I've ever had.  I'm not a risotto type, but this dish made me a forever lover.  Hopefully I can find another place that serves this dish in the States.  Oooh, almost forget the beet raspberry sorbet w/ panna cotta.  Never imaging having beet/raspberry sorbet together.   ahhhhh so good.  Enjoy!!!"}
