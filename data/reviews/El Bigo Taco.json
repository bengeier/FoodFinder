{"text":"Im picky for tacos but these taco are amazing  really recommend trying it out but skip the horchata it sucks but hey foods good plus they serve Mexican sodas ps cash only  learned that and had to walk to circle k for cash well come try it and get addicted like i did"}
{"text":"I was raised in the Bay Area & moved here from Southern California & these guys make the best carne asada tacos in the valley hands down. I have tried a ton of places including food trucks, Backyard Taco, Mucha Lucha, etc & these guys are the best...
I'm not a huge fan of their carnitas (which is normally my go too) but their carne asada tacos are legit."}
{"text":"Best tacos hands down!!! I'm picky with tacos coming from LA my heart is with King Taco and I got so excited when I found this food truck. Hard to find the perfect taco spot out here and they are cheap too."}
{"text":"This was my first time i have eaten at backyard taco. It was so good. Tastes like your at real backyard bbq. Cassandra at the University location was amazing!!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't let the storefront (OR lack of) fool you.
Food Truck type of restaurant. 
Order at the window and pay. 
Fast service.
Pretty Tasty food. 
Great selection.
Worth a try."}
{"text":"Hands down, best street tacos in Mesa. I've tried various and this is the best!They are authentic, and the size of their tacos is bigger than the average street taco. Their prices are good too! Don't let the area where they're located fool you though. My favorites was the adobada/al pastor taco. Will definitely recommend my friends about this place!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had since moving here hands down.  Everything is fresh and absolutely delicious.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"Best tacos in AZ!! 

And I like to believe that means a lot coming from me because I've tried most if not all the real Mexican taco places in the valley. I'm from Los Angeles, CA!... we take our tacos seriously and there is nothing compared to the tacos back home, but this place takes the cake for Arizona! Don't let the Little truck or location fool you, it is so delicious and the portions are huge. Unfortunately I have not tried anything other then the tacos but that's a good start. 
 
If you try , please let me know how you liked it."}
{"text":"I drove around and looked and looked for this place and was never to be found at the location listed on the map here."}
{"text":"Quick service - very to the point.  Tacos came out fast - they were just okay.  Actually quite spicy, if you are a wimp like me you better order a drink or bring a big water bottle."}
{"text":"Lady taking orders was super nice and nice supporting a local small business. I had 4 tacos overall they were ok. $2/ taco. They didn't have guac, I love quac on tacos. They were a little dry with out them. Tortillas were meh, meat kinda tasted like filli bs. These tacos have potential though."}
{"text":"Today is the second time I went and my experience wasn't all that. First the lady tried to over charge me second I got my Asada tacos with \"everything\" which they didn't add everything lol and finally my plate was extremely Greasy! This was the first time that I've ever had my Carne Asada tacos w/ Grease!

The first time I went it was bomb AF, I would have given this place 5 stars. 

Would I go back?? Umm most likely not."}
{"text":"Very very good tacos. The chefs in the truck are excellent. The whole time I was here there wasn't a moment where no one was ordering food. Great tacos and a homie atmosphere. Plenty of room for seating underneath the canopy. Definitely coming back. the fish tacos are bomb."}
{"text":"Not very fond of this business, they are very rude. I've been back 3 times and every time it's different. The food is super greasy. I usually get the torta de Asada with no salsa. (To ensure freshness) sad as it may, they still give me salsa on my Torta. So they don't listen to the special orders. Not to mention lady who takes the orders is super literal. When you say a salsa to go, she literally will give you one Salsa. The horchata is really good, and location could be better."}
{"text":"Los mejores tacos de Mesa!
Found this place by accident 2 years ago and it is one of the only places I will eat out at. The Al Pastor is amazing and they serve all tacos with caramelized onions, jalape√±o and radishes. The line can get long, it's cash only, and salsa is spicy; prepare accordingly ;)"}
{"text":"I don't hand out 5 stars easily, but this food truck is easily the best food truck in the East Valley for tacos. I've had on repeated occasions the lengua, cabeza and buche tacos and I'm confident in saying that they're as good, if not better than most taquerias I've visited in Mexico or LA. They have an extensive menu for a food truck and as a disclaimer all I've had are the tacos. They're cheap, service is fairly quick and they only take cash. Ask for grilled onions on the side too."}
{"text":"Had 3 different tacos from here: beef, chicken, and pork.  The carne asada was pretty much hamburger meat and it tasted the exact same as the minced chicken taco.  The carnitas had a bit more flavor, but very greasy.  Overall I was not impressed. There are a lot of other options in the area to get street tacos from like Mickeys or Backyard Taco for similar pricing."}
{"text":"It was one of those things that the first time you eat there it's decent because you don't know any better but the second time , you realize that the flavor in the meat is lacking and the grease is pouring out of your taco because it's just part of the recipe. It's fine if you have little to no options and you're tired of filibertos."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  We drove by a few times and thought the name was a little comical, and it being a trailer park outside of an army surplus store didn't exactly scream a must try place.  But, everytime we drove by there were always people there so we decided to give it a try.  Thank goodness we did.  They have some of the best street tacos I have tasted, and the bean burritos are giant.  We usually get the carne asada tacos, but they have a variety of traditional Mexican meats, carnitas, lengua, etc. all at very cheap prices.  Just make sure you bring cash as that is their only form of payment."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos in town. Authentic Mexican street tacos. The fish and asada tacos are my favorite. The bean and cheese are excellent too. the salsa is amazing but it's the FIRE. I use it sparingly. Next time I order I will take some pictures. This place is a gem. Must try it."}
