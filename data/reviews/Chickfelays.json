{"text":"Very disappointing  Honestly I could have just grilled a piece of chicken and put it on a bun at home. The flavour just wasn't there at all.  I also found it quite odd that they say \"Proudly Canadian Eh\" on their signs and menus, while simultaneously an Afghani plate and having only people who didn't speak English well behind the counter. Very odd.  Overall, it was bland, boring, and not worth spending any money at."}
{"text":"I love chicken! Especially Portuguese style chicken. I never understood why some places brag about their chicken being air chilled. Chicken tastes best when it's juicy. When it's chilled, it tastes like rubber and it's really dry. The best chicken are not only juicy but also flavorful. Chick Felays delivers on both counts.   Chick Felay says their chicken are marinated for 24 hours. When I eat a piece, I'm inclined to believe them. In a lot of other places, the chicken only seems to have taste on the outer layers. Chick Felay's chicken is swimming in flavor in every bite.   I've only tried their chicken so far in my 2 visits. If I go again, I'll probably get chicken again. They do have some middle eastern stuff like humus and kebobs but I guess I won't be trying those as I love their chicken too much.  My only complain are their prices. I think their prices are a little steep. However, their portions are decent on their sides. I feel that if their prices are $2-3 lower (like Bairrada), it'd be more reasonable. But I love their chicken so much I'm willing to settle for paying a premium."}
{"text":"For a change we came here for dinner. Had the chicken wings and the Afgani platter dinner.  The wings were very moist and come plain, you are given two bottles of peri sauce, one hotter than the other!  Needless to say, it was very good! Different from the crispy wings you get elsewhere.  The Afgani platter had 2 skewers of meat, one chicken and the other beef served on basmati rice with some salad. See the pic I posted!  All in was a reasonably priced meal.  Thanks to the Yelp check in offer, we were given a free chicken leg!"}
