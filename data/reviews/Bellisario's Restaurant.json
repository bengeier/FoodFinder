{"text":"I visited this restaurant on a weekend I was in town for a concert. It certainly isn't upscale Italian food, but it serves its purpose. The food is okay. The restaurant atmosphere is older but okay. The staff is friendly but just okay. If you're hungry, this place will feed you. If you are celebrating, and looking for a great meal or great service, this won't be the place for you. The chicken parmigiana was just okay as well. Your Mom's home cooked is probably better, but it wasn't the worst thing in the world. The hoagies are a bit over cooked in the oven, but they taste okay. Sauces cost extra here, which is okay with me. Their ranch wasn't the best, which is disappointing as most Italian restaurants have amazing homemade ranch. The provolone sticks were the worst, and had no flavor. I would stay away from those. However, I saw Pizza on the table next to me that looked very good. If I were to come back, that's where I would go."}
{"text":"Filthy gross and old 

Even the staff are gross yinzer types

Pizza can be inconsistent 

The place needs a complete makeover

The bar crowd is pathetic"}
{"text":"I have been happy with the food but I  no longer am going back. I was with 8 other women and we go to this restaurant at least once a month. My friend asked for a little extra sauce on her meal and was charged an extra amount. After years of going to this restaurant they have decided to charge everyone an extra $1 for using a debit or credit card. I just find this outrageous in a world where almost everyone uses plastic.
The parking situation is dangerous if you need to park in the back. 
I must compliment the servers and the chef but the management/owners obviously are not interested in return customers."}
