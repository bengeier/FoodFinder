{"text":"Horrible service! long wait time. Good price but not worth it if you have to more than 45 minutes!"}
{"text":"The service is terrible!  Only 3 other tables besides mine and the waitress didn't check on me once.  No water refills, and I finally had to walk up to the register to pay.  The food was incredibly salty - which added to my need for more water.  The expensive breakfast simply wasn't worth it and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"What a waste. Considering its Sunday at brunch hours you'd think it would be wise to have a hostess at the front. Well... They didn't get the memo on how to run a restaurant. After the wait a waitress sat us down with a look on her face like we're bothering her by being here. Fine whatever I'm starving so I say nothing.  I order coffee and surprise... The espresso machine is broken. I'm beyond annoyed at this point but since we already sat down I chose to stay. I ordered smoked salmon omelette. When it came to the table it looked so pathetic and tasted even worse. This is not an isolated incident. I've come here 4 times thinking it would be different each time but no, still the same abysmal service and sub-mediocre food.   Never again. Cora's or Bobby's will get my business from now on."}
{"text":"I live literally 3 minutes from this place so whenever I'm in a rush I go here to grab breakfast or when I'm with my friends and we have a craving for crepes and waffles we walk here and every time, I've regretted it, the staff is very unfriendly, they stand around chit chatting and not paying attention to guests, the food is fine to me, the chef looks like a nice guy and an okay cook so I feel bad for him to have to work with these unfriendly servers. Just don't go here, its a waste of time and money  food = 3/5 service = 1/5 cleanliness = 4/5"}
{"text":"Went here when it first opened (they were setting up the banners at the front the day we were there) because we thought the dressed up eggs in the window were quite cute.  After we were seated and saw the menu we realized that the place was a complete carbon copy of Cora's.    Many of the dishes were the same as Cora's, even the presentation was the same, lots of fruit on the plate, toast in baskets etc.  In fact, everything seemed so Twilight Zone Cora's that we thought maybe, just maybe they were owned by Cora's.    In the end, I felt like the place was a bit of a poser-at least differentiate yourself somehow other than the cute eggs dressed up in the window.  If you go to Cora's or here-it'll be the same meal for about the same price."}
{"text":"It's \"ok\" at best. Cora is way better or even Denny's. Their tutti frutti special is very weird, it's one egg on top of half a Cinnabon then fruits on top another half a Cinnabon. There's no hash or potatoes. My dad got a different special and his seemed a lot better, it's basically like Cora's special but no fruit. Overall not a bad place."}
{"text":"I think that this place is ok however I think that there is nothinh special about this place other than all the fruit they give you.plus side is the presentation of the food and the good service which makes it worth it sometimes.It is a bit pricey but better than sunset grill by far"}
{"text":"So.............................................whats up?  I'm having nomnom problems. You see/read ,breakfast hasn't been the same (as in not healthy) since my introduction to Tutti Frutti. I'm not even sure how I fully feel about it. Sometimes I'm okay with a little weight gain and sometimes I doodle curse catch phrases that cleverly rhyme with tutti frutti. Before all that, I must admit I enjoy the name. Naturally I find myself saying a whole lotta 'hey, wanna Tutti?'. (You heard it here first). Whilst I do feel the funzies saying it (sometimes to complete strangers if they posses a pen I'd like to take. As a souvenir) I do find myself in a battle of 'i-hate-my-food-baby' mid evening-ish.   Even though this place is always busy on weekend mornings (expect to wait about 20minutes) somehow not many people around me have been here. Am I hanging around too many un-breakfasty people? I don't know. What I do know is how exaggerated the menu options are. In a good way. It's the kind of place you can really get your craving cured. If you are feeling like you want that sugary/cinamony then be sure to order the maple crisp, if you are in a tough seduction tango with chocolate then go right ahead and order the hazelnut berry-chocolate crepe (you are welcome), if you're running on a creamy kinda day then dip into the eggs-benni (if you can't have the porker then get the spinach), and if you are in the mood for the regular buttery eggs then make sure to avoid the omelette's (they aren't worth the portion you get) and go for the 3 eggs any style. I think they have the best side potatoes here. it's not the big chunky/badly cut ones but circular perfectly crispy and potato-ey mix. They even have a lunch menu that you can order after a certain time. Truthfully, I haven't gotten through the Breakfast menu enough to get there but I do skim through the interesting options.   Unlike most breakfast joints that offer the straight eggs and potatDoh this fun titled place is (to me) more of a desert type of breakfast. Crepes, waffles, pancakes, french toasts etc. The portions for the desserts are rather large - HOWEVER, if you order the 2egg (any style) or omelette's it's small. Womp Womp (T_T). especially when you are so hungry and everyone elses plate looks like it was piled on.   The prices are a bit much for breakfast but you pay for all the fun colours in the name. The place has nothing too extravagant so very ordinary table/chair combo with a sufficiently large dining area. The bathrooms could do a small reno but that might just be me.  In terms of drinks, the coffee cold be better but I suppose it does the job. The green tea is average. I do highly recommend the juices. If you are a juice fan then try the grapefruit mixed with orange juice., It is delicious! (Trust me, I'm Muslim).  My only (and this could only be important to me) complaint is the water - or rather the cup they choose to give you water in. It's most definitely not enough. And that isn't coming from a 'I'm so greedy' kind of way. The cup is smaller than the children's cup at McDonald's.  Anyhoot my ultimate decision is to chill out on this place because it only makes me crave it the next weekend. BUT, and a big BUTT is that if I were trying to impress someone or meet them for breakfast- I'd invite them here. It's busier and cleaner than the regular Sunset Grill or the local breakfast joint that caters to the ham'N'egg type of crowd. Plus the waitresses are very pretty. One looks like Princess Jasmine from Aladdin. Another looks like a Russian ballerina - nevertheless, they are all wonderfully friendly. I do suggest coming in early or a tad later in the afternoon to skip the busy crowd. Unless you are a fan of lineups so you can creep the rest of the customers or spot the 'first-date' or make bets on the couples that are in a fight and possibly who's fault it could be.   I should add that if you are a big loyalty/rewards points collecting type of weirdo with undiscriminating selection of loyalty cards in your wallet - you will be happy to know that they do have one. I haven't gotten around to understanding how the redeeming actually works but I can get points if I eat at Thai Express too so - SOLD!  Happy tutti-ing.   xoxo M."}
{"text":"We waited 10 min to have our order taken. Another 10 min to get our table set. Even after, we were still missing a fork and a knife, but it was a hassle just trying to get their attention so we just shared it!   While the above complaint is very common in a somewhat busy restaurant (i think they were more short staffed than busy), the rest of our experience was not!  While waiting for our food (which came in 15 min) we saw what I wish we could all UNSEE! A woman who worked there, was standing behind the counter (which is not really enclosed), coughed on her hand and spat something phlegmy (we saw the trail of something gross coming out of her mouth!) on some soggy looking napkin, which I HOPED she tossed in the trash, because all of a sudden we see her HAND DOWN THE FRONT OF HER PANTS! Like front and centre inside of her pants!! I don't know what just happened and what we just witnessed, but we were so shocked that we just kept an eye her to make sure she wasn't serving any of our food! She wasn't! Phew! But still she touched things after, so that's gross!  Once we got most of our meal, my mom didn't get her porridge, so we ate and waited for another 10 min and when it finally came there were BUGS like fruit flies all over the porridge. She had it returned and ordered something easier to make, a bagel and cream cheese... but that took another 10 min!  And to end it all, my mom told me after the meal that when she went to the bathroom she saw POOP smear on the walls.   That was when I stood up and just RAN outside because I started feeling sick and just wanted to go home."}
{"text":"Been here couple of time and love it every time!!!  The food is great, taste is nice and the portions are healthy and tummy filling. Their menu is huge and attractive and I am in love with the Poached eggs with asparagus and Swiss cheese... THEY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH! there potatoes are really good too.  I have also tried their omelettes and French toast and they were great. Their coffee is refillable but their lattes are decent too.  The service is good and seems like they enjoy their job as they crack jokes and come back each and every time to see if everything is good. The price point for the quantity and quality is quite good as you come out satisfied.   The restaurant is quite big and has plenty of seating and that's one of the great point of this place as you don't have to waiting like crazy compared to Cora's and Denny's at breakfast time. There is plenty of parking as the place is located in a giant plaza in Heartland."}
{"text":"This breakfast place is okay, the quality of food is not there, they have a $4.99 early bird special from 7-8 am I believe but i had better food   I used to go there regularly because I was lazy too cook breakfast, but the restaurant is just mediocre also they have those horrible microwaved bacon that I absolutely hate.  Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"I dont mind Tutti Frutti's. Nothing outstanding on the menu that I cant get at Coras or Sunset Grill. Im an Eggs Benedict lover and am not a huge fan of theirs. I did enjoy the large portions of fruits they offered on our french toast and crepes but service is slow."}
{"text":"First time dining here and I loved it!  Awesome menu variety...can't go wrong with good ol' heartwarming breakfast food.  Pretty much like Cora's (with fruit decor all all) but without the hefty price tag.  Ordered poached eggs with French toast, home fries and buttered toast and happily devoured it!  Coffee was steadily refilled.  Waitress was quick and friendly, despite the heavy Sunday brunch crowd.  Was totally impressed with my first time here and will return to slowly try out the other menu items...great to pair with mall shopping!"}
{"text":"Staff was very unprofessional and rude! Do not bother with this place! Go to Cora's instead!!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. I had noticed this place a few times while driving by, and decided to stop by with 4 friends after lunch for some dessert.  All 5 of us ordered coffees, and decided to share 2 orders of french toast between the 5 of us, not because we are cheap, but because we just wanted a light dessert. When we got our bill, we discovered to our dismay that $2 had been added for each person as a 'sharing' fee.   I found this absolutely ridiculous, and had I known about this before I ordered, I would have walked right out.   I find breakfast food in general is a huge ripoff - I mean, come on, you're already paying 12 bucks for 4 pieces of white bread dipped in egg and fried. To charge a fee for sharing is beyond cheap. Needless to say, we will never return, and neither will any of our friends or family, if we can help it."}
{"text":"Came to Tutti Frutti on a Saturday morning, close to the lunch hour.  We had a fairly large group (8 people) and had not made a reservation prior, but had no issue being seated. The place wasn't very busy that morning.  The selection was rather extensive, similar to Cora's in many respects. I found myself torn as to whether to go with something sweet or savory - but this is a common ailment I face when at lunch places.   Some of my friends had eaten earlier that particular morning, so when they did not order a dish of their own and instead decided to share with their significant others, the waitress informed us of a recent (implemented just that day) policy that an additional $2 would be charged for plate-sharing in such a way. She did come back shortly after and confirmed that given our group size, that the policy would not be applicable (??) but I still don't agree with such a rule.  The meal was ok - again, many similarities to Cora's. From the decorative, themastic menus, the fruit-craft nature that is present on most dishes.   I ordered the Delicious French Toast (\"With a mountain of fresh fruit\") - which did not taste too bad. It wasn't anything special: french toast, sliced decoratively and arranged with a pile of fruit (apple slices, banana, melon, plum, grape) in the center.  Might return if desperate for a Cora's-like meal and Cora's ends up being full with a lineup.."}
{"text":"Nice looking brunch dishes, huge portions, good selection. We had the French toast and eggs Florentine. Plenty of fruit in each serving. The service was adequate, not great, and the food quality and taste were passable. Bigger is not better in this case."}
{"text":"poor service ,took 15 mins to get served,manager is just as bad(amit) .seem to feel closing early (2:45 pm is ok as not enough business ,yet sign say 3pm.  bacon was cold ,they cave it bake reheated!!  supossed to be all fresh made items i will nver go back ,lots of other choice in breakfast ( bobby hideway ,sunset grill)"}
{"text":"Ate here on Sunday. The server Cynthia was very nice. She took care of me well. The food was ok too. I wasn't too thrilled with it but it wasn't bad."}
