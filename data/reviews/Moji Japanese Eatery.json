{"text":"The food was okay BUT while I was there, one of the waitresses spilt dirty leftover juice from cleaning another table over the seat of my friend's back. The liquid soaked up her dress, bag and jacket. After the incident none of the servers came to apologize and/or offer any sort of compensation for ruining my friends belongings. At most we were met with complete indifference by the staff and some paper towels to dry her stuff off. Additionally, our dishes were suppose to come with egg but did not. When we asked, they said they had run out but failed to tell us beforehand. 

The service here was extremely disappointing. I normally do not write yelp reviews but wanted to warn people about the service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great for a basic Japanese don-style dinner or lunch! The interior decor is very cute, very Instagram-able, and the food is consistent. Portion sizes are small, so you may want to plan accordingly by ordering appetizers as well. Otherwise, prices are decent for the very tasty comfort food!
My favourites are the unagi donburi and the buta(pork) spicy mayo rice.
$2 drinks with a meal is also great!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The place is quite cute, and its nice to have some variety in Markham. BUT the waiting time to get food once you sit down is ridiculous. They really have to work on whatever cooking system they have going on, because it is not working. 

You would think it would be pretty easy to do a restaurant where all they basically have is donburi and udon, but apparently not. 

I waited over an hour for a tempura udon, which is basically just noodle soup with a few pieces of fried seafood on top. And by my observation, I was clearly not the only one in this situation. In fact, most tables I saw, one customer would finish eating and then their companions dish would come, after a 10 minute wait. Pretty hilarious to watch actually, but not so much when you're getting annoyed/hungry. 

So my two companions got their food 40 minutes after we got there. I got mine about an hour in, after asking both the waitresses where my dish was. I guess they felt pretty bad, so they told me my dish was on the house. Which is nice in theory, but GUESS WHAT, they gave me the WRONG dish. Nice..

And though they took the dish off the bill, they charged us for a dish that never arrived after an hour and a half....so...yeah. 

The food is mediocre at best. Lots of places do the same mediocre Japanese food. Also, don't understand why there's apple in the donburi. 

Oh the Matcha Latte is not bad. A bit too sweet but not bad.

So maybe, if you have 2 1/2 hours to kill, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend coming here. I don't think i'll ever come back."}
{"text":"Great service 

but they put back cantaloupe back to your food with someone else's bite mark. 

Hope the manager noticed this!"}
{"text":"Finally, we are getting more non-sushi Japanese eateries in Markham! This is definitely a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. I find that their choice of location odd, as that plaza has certainly declined over the years. At least there was plenty of parking when i went on a Wednesday evening. Im also not sure why they chose such a large unit. It wasnt busy at all when i went so I hope they get more business on the more popular dining out days.

Like the other reviewers, I also really enjoyed their cute decor! The service was very quick and the food was served in a timely manner (most likely because it wasn't very busy that evening). I had the spicy buta mayo don and my husband had the spicy beef don. Both had a very generous serving of rice and meat. Both were well seasoned. I didnt really understand why there was cantalope in my rice, but I did enjoy it at the end of my meal. I think i would have preferred if the cantalope and edamame were separated from the main dish.

I cant say i was blown away by this place, but the food was good enough that I will certainly be back again to try their other items!"}
{"text":"I like the style of their decorations, very nature and cute. I order a lunch special , which have main , snack ,and drink only for $6. Amazing price"}
{"text":"Really like the decor there. They make it look like a garden. Totally different from any restaurants in the plaza.

The food is also quite flavorful. However, they appear to have a big menu but there is not a lot of selections. We had the spicy curry beef with udon. it was above average. We also had the tempura udon, which was also above average Adding $2 to get a drink is relatively inexpensive. For dessert, we tried the durian/taro ice cream. They are nice, although flavors were on the light side. 

This is  kids friendly place. I see a lot of parents bring their kids there but the total bill will end up bigger than expected as the kids, once they see the ice cream dessert, will ask for one."}
{"text":"Worst udon and curry rice I ever tried. The soup base got no taste at all. I don't know why they put fruit into the udon! 

Curry rice, like canfood. Beef is from frozen hotpot beef. I cannot tell it is beef or pork!"}
{"text":"I decided to come to Moji for my birthday. 
The service here was excellent and they have a good selection of food. My favourite part of the meal was the black tea soft serve ice cream (I love my tea in any form LOL). My friends and I were the last ones at the restaurant, however the owner didn't rush us to leave. He even helped us take a few pictures and carried a nice conversation with us as well. Definitely plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"First timer. 

We got shrimp tempura don, beef don, and grill squid & milk tea popcorn ice cream. 

Shrimp tempura is very nicely crunchy and taste fresh. Beef on the other hand were average and slightly on the sweet side for me. 

Rices were soft but doesn't have the nice smell or tastes some Japanese restaurant had.  And I don't understand the concept of cantaloupe pieces mixing with my salty and spicy sauces. It's really odd for me. 

Grill squid is pretty nice. But my family said it's a bit too dry. 

Ice cream with milk tea flavour is nice but popcorn is a bit odd for me. Will like to try mocha flavour next time. 

The restaurant is very cold for some reason. I saw many ppl wear their winter coats even when they are eating."}
{"text":"I suppose I would describe this place as cute. I wouldn't be able to say that the food is very good. 

Shared the takoyaki and grilled Octopus . There's definitely better out there. (try Jinya's.. My current fav for takoyaki) 

Had the spicy pork rice bowl. It was a mash up of flavours on a bed of undercooked rice.

Finished with the matcha soft serve... I wish they used better matcha. It was green soft serve with some lingering bitterness. The bright side was that it was a good level of sweet (i.e. Not too sweet). Although, you figure they would use green tea Pocky to pair with the soft serve...alas it was plain ole chocolate. 

Service was hit or miss. Some staff were good, others not so much. 

Sometimes you try a new restaurant and find a great gem to add to the rotation, this one will not be."}
{"text":"Extremely bad service!!! Never coming back!!! We were really hungry and ordered two udons and some appetizers. The order was made by us writing the dish number on a piece of paper. After waiting hungrily for 45 min a waitress came and asked if we have ordered. They somehow lost our order sheet. When we gave the sheet to the waitress she just mindlessly put it in the pocket of her apron and now they weren't even sure if we ordered or not. They gave us the menu again and asked us to reorder our food. We were so pissed that we left to eat McDonald's instead. Such a waste of time!!! This is so ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"Despite my two star rating, it's more of a 2.5. Came here on a Thursday evening around 7:30 (right before Easter long weekend), place wasn't crowded and had plenty of seating. Decor is laid back and cute. I ordered a hot matcha milk tea, assorted tempura, and buta mayo don. 

While service was really attentive and fairly quick, their food/drink is mediocre. The matcha milk tea was average and the tempura batter was not as crunchy as most places. The buta mayo don did taste good and kept me satisfied. I do however like to point out that the two pieces of cantolope placed in the dish did not suit the salty flavors. As for dessert, I wanted to try the mochi ice cream but they ran out."}
{"text":"Moji is a cute Japanese eatery with simple mismatched cafeteria style interior.  If you are looking for raw sushi then go elswhere, Moji has a simple cooked Japanese food menu. 

My thoughts on our meal:

- Unagi Rice: Flavours are just right but comes with two slices of cantaloupe which is a bit weird or interesting mixed with the salty food.
- Takoyaki:  Done just right with little waving crispers.
- Tempura Udon:  Probably my least favourite in the meal, tempura was small and udon was definitely from frozen bag.
- Matcha Milk Tea:  Matcha flavour is prominent and the price of $2 is amazing
- Grilled Squid:  Tastes a bit like the squid was boiled first then grilled as opposed to completely grilled on the bbq.
- Avocado Tofu:  Nice and refreshing.

Service is quick and attentive.  Super excited for this new addition in Markham."}
{"text":"I liked this place instantly upon walking in. A cute place with wide space and wood and tile decor. Nice ceiling lights and a Christmas tree because it was the holiday season. Japanese music plays in the background. There's a shelf for their collection of Japanese serving bowls. 

Menu wise, there's a page of drinks and dessert with another for donburi and udon. We had the gyu (beef) don, a karaage (fried chicken) don, a gyu udon and a buta mayo (pork with mayo drizzled over) donburi. For appetizer, we shared a takoyaki which came hot and delicious. Overall, the food was not fantastic but tasty. Everyone liked their food although  DH felt the rice wasn't soft enough. I liked my rice. Can't please everyone! Average value; for about $8.50, the donburi comes with miso soup, creamy soft-boiled egg, pickled ginger, cucumber and apple slices. My least favourite item in the bowl is the apple slices because they were turning brown and I didn't feel the sweetness complemented the rice bowl. 

Service was adequate but I wish they had refilled my water. They serve it in little Japanese bowls. 

I'll return for sure."}
{"text":"Restaurant with a hipster vibe. The speed of the service is ok, and prices are somewhat reasonable. Though the drinks do come off a bit pricey when looking at the volume."}
{"text":"Price is very reasonable, but the taste is average and the menu is nothing special. If you just want to spend some leisure time with friends and don't picky with food, this might be the place for you"}
{"text":"Decor: Went there with my friends on Victoria Day. The place wasn't very packed at 6:30PM. The store was quite clean. Their layout took a minimalistic approach, matching with their Japanese homey concept. 

Service: There were only two servers working. They took our orders and it took them quite a long time to bring us our food. We also noticed that people that ordered after us got our food before us...not very impressed with that.

Food: Our table ordered 3 Spicy Gyudon, 1 Spicy Buta Mayo Don and 1 Buta Mayo Don. All our rice bowls were lukewarm. The soup was alright, but could have been hotter. One of our rice bowls only got half an egg. Portions were small and there was very little meat, we had to ration our meat with the rice. In our opinion, the items were overpriced for the quality and quantity provided. It would have been alright for the $5.99 Happy Hour special, but definitely not for its original price!"}
{"text":"It's 3.5.

We ordered the unagi don($11.95) and shrimp tempura don ($10.95).  Both were above average and nicely bowled(avocado, ginger, apple slices, eggs) .  They also had hot/cold specialty drinks for $2 each.  Accepts credit cards! Will return for sure."}
{"text":"How about no stars? Walked in at 9:25pm on Sunday. They closed at 10pm. Didn't get greeted and I had to ask \"do we seat ourselves?\", they asked \"for how many people?\", I responded \"2\". 

Two staff members looked at the time and gave me a blank look and said \"ummm...\" and I took that as they didn't want to serve me so close to closing (almost 40 minutes till closing). I literally had to ask \"do you want me to leave?\".... All I got was...\" sorry\" in the most insincere way. So we walked out, never knowing if this place will be worth to come back. 

Goodness, you serve desserts! I gobble that up in 5 minutes. Could've at least say \"Sorry, do you mind doing takeout?\"..... I wasn't going to beg to give them my money. Bad business management."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends a couple of times and loved the decor/ambience. The food were good and peach calpis was amazing (although it may be a bit too sweet for some people)."}
{"text":"Oh just found this cute trendy restaurant in the Chinese plaza on Kennedy, the foods are fresh and flavorful, and they sell lots of Matcha green tea desserts as well. Definitely come back for the desserts!"}
{"text":"Would come back again. Food and decor are both creative. Price is a bit on the higher end for this type of food. Place is not busy and location easily accessible."}
{"text":"I've been here twice before. The food was okay, nothing blew my mind. Tasted as I expected but it wasn't exactly cheap either. The drinks were okay, I got a matcha milk and a taro milk and there was barely any flavour. Also matcha ice cream barely has matcha flavour, good thing it was free."}
{"text":"Went to Moji for dinner with a couple of friends. As it was our first visit, it was a bit tricky to find  it in the large plaza but we eventually found it. The first impressions I had was that the restaurant was brightly lit and the decor was so quaint and warm. It was also quite spacious and large. Pretty much every seat was filled. I really liked how the restaurant was set up - Big compliments to the interior designer! It had a nice wood and natural industrial feel to the decor. 

Service: As this was our first time here, I can't compare to other visits but this night, the service was a bit slow. We think it was due to not enough staff in the kitchen. We were seated as soon as a table opened up. After ordering, it took about 10 - 15 minutes to just get our drinks. It took an additional 15 minutes to get one of our appetizers and another 2 minutes for the second. Our main dishes arrived another 15 minutes after we finished the apps. It may have been due to our extreme hunger but it seemed like the food was not coming fast enough. Upon looking around the restaurant, many of the tables were waiting for food as well. Despite the longer wait time than usual restaurants like this, we will visit again. Let's hope the service is a little faster next time.

Food: the Menu for the drinks was hand written on planks of wood; matching the theme of the eatery. It was a simple menu with options for several Japanese don (rice) or udon (noodle) dishes. You could choose from beef, chicken, pork, seafood or vegetable toppings with at least 3 varieties in each category.

My friends and I shared the takoyaki and the karage. Both were hot and fresh when it arrived. They were so tasty that we inhaled all of it in seconds. For my main, I chose the mayo buta don (pork rice with mayo on top) which I must say was very delicious. It came with edamame beans, ginger and apple slices adding to the beautiful presentation. The don was covered with slices of well cooked pork and just enough mayo and don sauce to give taste but not to overpower the rest of the dish. The bowl was quite deep and there was more rice than you'd think looking at the dish. It could have used a bit more meat but this is coming from a meat lover! I did wish the food was a little hotter, but again that's my personal preference. My friends ordered the gyu don (beef rice) and the curry buta don (curry pork), both enjoyed their meals as much as I did. 

Drinks: They had a special for drinks. If you ordered a main dish, hot and cold drinks could be ordered for an additional $2. Pretty good deal I must say. I ordered the hot matcha milk tea. As a self proclaimed matcha aficionado (not really... just a matcha lover), I found the drink to be a perfect blend of matcha and sweetness. If you like matcha, it has a strong matcha flavour but not so overpowering that your face will contort due to the usual natural bitterness of matcha. The marshmallows were a nice touch to add colour and sweetness. It also came in a nice large mug, similar to something you would use at home to drink a nice hot drink on a cold day. My friends ordered the mixed fruit green tea (hot) and the taro milk tea (hot). The mixed fruit tea was a bit too sweet for my friend but she said it was very fruity. From what I saw, the taro milk tea was a bit more purple than I expected but my friend didn't complain. 

Price: The prices ranged from about $8 to $15 per dish which I think is reasonable. For 2 appetizers, 3 don's and 3 drinks the total came up to about $55 for the 3 of us. Though not the cheapest meal I've had, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was very cozy and warm. Good for casual eating. I didn't mind paying a little more, plus Japanese food in general tends to be a little more costly than other Asian cuisines.

Overall, this eatery was a nice find as it's different from any other Japanese restaurant I've been to. It's unique in that it was much more casual than most Japanese places and the decor was so simple but really really nice (even the bathroom followed the theme). I love the bright and open space. They also offered a free ice cream (either matcha or taro or mixed) until the end of January. It was a nice offer to finish off the meal. I will be returning sometime to try the udon and other dishes. If you don't mind risking a bit of slow service, I would definitely try the place out!"}
{"text":"When we first went in, we had to wait for a while until someone seated us. We ordered the 2 appetizers: wasamayo takoyaki and grilled squid. Both was delicious and fresh! Then I ordered the Buta udon and the portion was actually quite small for the price. At the end, I was told by other people that they had a free matcha ice cream promo but I was not given any coupon when I asked for the bill. The reason is they only have limited amount of coupons to hand out each day so if you want to try the match ice cream for free, I would recommend you to go earlier! Overall the food was really good but the service and food delivery was quite slow from my experience."}
{"text":"Cute little Japanese eatery with average tasting food.

Gyu donburi
The beef was tasty and flavourful as was the seasoned soft boiled egg. However, I thought the other items in the dish didn't pair well, namely the cantaloupe, which I thought was kind of strange... The portion was also kind of small on my opinion. 

Takoyaki
I decided to try this after reading all the great reviews but I find it to be underwhelming. The Takoyaki balls were quite small. They were still decent but not the best.

Overall, portions were quite small but then again, the dishes are fairly cheap. I'll give them points for presentation though. They definitely put in the effort to make their food and restaurant instagram-friendly."}
{"text":"I really like this place however, my husband and I experienced a stomach bug from drinking their iced-based drinks. I believe they really need to clean their ice making machine. Also, when they add the sweet syrup, it gets all over the drinking straw and you end up with syrup all over your hands. Stay away from ordering any cold drinks that have ice until they have verified that the machine has been cleaned thoroughly that day. I used to work at Second Cup where it was mandatory to sanitize the ice machines every single day with a nickel-safe sanitizer even if the machine was not used. If you do research, ice machines are where the most bacteria like to harbor especially if reverse-osmosis water is used.

Other than the cold drinks, the food is very good and they have excellent service. My favorite is the avocado crab rice. Their takoyaki is yummy. They recently updated their menu and now they have ramen as well. The ambience is very modern Japanese cute and trendy with mismatched chairs. The presentation is excellent with the use of high quality Japanese dishware and the service is top notch. I have not tried their desserts but, I do see from other patrons that the desserts are very popular."}
{"text":"I came here on a busy Saturday night and understandably the service was slow. I only came for dessert and ordered the Taro Soft serve which looked great at first, but as I dug into it I noticed there was a pretty big hole underneath the swirly top of the ice cream. Ice cream to hole ratio: C-"}
{"text":"Solid 5 stars.  Curry is soo good. Had curry chicken, curry tampura, and green tea ice cream! They were all very good."}
{"text":"I love MOJI!

THE FOOD
I always get their chicken karage - it comes with miso soup and the edamame and a slice of cantelope in the bowl. The chicken is fried so well and the rice portion is more than enough. The ladies are work there are very kind and try their best to cater to you even when busy.
Also ordered before: eel rice, buta pork rice, curry beef rice, chicken karage udon, takoyaki
Also ordered drinks: lychee yogurt bbt, peach yogurt bbt, peach green tea bbt

THE DECOR
Super cute and clean! I like the novelty that they stuck with a white and wood theme, some pink and blue plastic chairs then some wooden chairs. The plants and clock are a cute touch. The bathrooms are also clean and parking is decent (what you would expect at peach tree center).

Would totally go again! :)"}
{"text":"Food: 5
Ambience: 5
Cleanliness: 5
Service: 3

I've been to Moji 3 times; once as a group of 3 and twice on my own. I've often come at odd hours of the day and hence, I've never had any issues getting a table. The food was great, albeit slightly on the pricier side. However, they do have interesting and well-made dishes, so definitely hitting that innovation/gimmick surcharge. 

The food is great. If you're a fan of unagi, the tobiko cheese unagi don is great and they don't skimp on the unagi either, as some other places do. They have one of the better uptown karaages, but I would probably ask for the sauce on the side in the future. Finally, their tofu avocado salad is amazingly refreshing. Definitely a fan. Their drinks however are either much too sweet or not flavourful enough, so it's difficult to find a good balance. Their matcha milk tea could use a bit less sugar and it would be perfect.  

The ambience is super cute, with a quaint DIY-vibe. They definitely created a nice and unique image for themselves in the midst of many new and exciting restaurants in Markham and Richmond Hill. 

On to the service... This is where they lost points for me. The wait staff is pretty set and I'm pretty sure it's been the same 3 servers every time I've gone. Now the guy is honestly great. Very polite. Works hard. Efficient. There's another female staff that appears to be scowling like all the time and she looks like she absolutely hates her job and doesn't want to be there. Her short mannerisms and expressionless voice and face don't help, and in all honesty, it makes me feel slightly intimidated to ask her for anything. It's quite unfortunate really, but apart from that, everything is great and I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"The food is pretty decent, I m surprised it's not busier on a Sunday night. We orders the beef gyu don and curry gyu dong, both turned out pretty good! They also have great drinks! Right now they have this promotion, for extra 2 bucks, you can get a cold/hot drink. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A great don buri style Japanese eatery.  Glad to find another quaint place that offers delicious Japanese food other than sushi.  Overall, was impressed with the food, service and decor.  Will definitely be back to try more apps and their drinks too.  

Food: 
Huge selection and menu was great with pictures for all the dishes.  Ordered the Grilled squid and various dons (unagi, chicken karrage, curry prawn) which came with soup.  Great portion size and tasted great.  Can't wait to come back to try other appetizers too.  

Decor: 
Loved the ambiance and cute decor.  The mismatched chairs added to the comfortable atmosphere.   I also loved the little potted plants on each table.  :)"}
{"text":"It is actually a 3.5

Service:
- wasn't extraordinary, but wasn't bad either
- it requires you to write out the orders you want. it is frustrating because of the fact that paper was small and you had to adjust your font so that everything fits onto it
- needs to wait about 15-20 mins. until your order comes out

Food:
- ordered a seafood tempura rice and the tempura was fried perfectly! not too fried and oily; just right. the pairing with the other items in the dish such as the cantaloupe did not pair well. 
- ordered an iced genmaicha green tea. it was sweet, yet the green tea didn't left an aftertaste in my mouth
- ordered the twist of matcha green tea/vanilla ice cream with pocky as topping. nothing special except the over grandiose of designing how the ice-cream was placed with the Moji card logo stuck right in the middle.

Overall:
- the happy hour of $5.99 is definitely a deal steal!
- don't come in to eat here if you are extremely hungry since the serving size is too small to be filling
- cute interior design that reminds you of little cute shops in Japan
- washrooms are clean, yet is colder than the rest of the restaurant"}
{"text":"I ordered the takoyaki for starters- it was delicious but quite soggy. I wish they fried it a bit more. I recommend coming here for their soft serve ice cream but not for food. The rice was very dry as well as the meat for the karaage did not seem fresh.  There were no utensils on our table, I asked one of the female servers, she acknowledged my request for a fork but she never came back with one. Had to ask another server. Would come back but only for their dessert."}
{"text":"I heard about Moji from Instagram and somehow thought they only offered desserts, so it's taken me a while to come and visit. Their location is a bit hidden for first timers but nothing to complain about. We came here on January 30, 2016 and there was about 3 groups waiting in front of us. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated (which was expected given it's a Friday night and it's the holidays). If I'm being picky I would suggest more seating at the front for people to sit and wait.

We ordered the takoyaki, the chicken karaage rice bowl, the tempura shrimp w/ curry rice bowl, and the oreo ice cream cup w/ black milk tea as a dessert. 

Chicken karaage rice bowl - the batter was a little bit too soft, not crispy enough and the bowl could use one more topping other than the steamed edamame beans, and two slice of cantaloupe. Flavour of the chicken was really good though. Overall I feel it could benefit with more sauce/topping for the amount of plain white rice given

Tempura shrimp w/ curry - VERY good, nothing to complain about. The shrimp was very crispy and flavourful and the curry was excellent, would definitely recommend this!

Takoyaki - Not the best we've ever had, but still very good. I would recommend this as well if you are in the mood for takoyaki.

Oreo ice cream cup - Apparently there are two flavours for the soft serve ice cream, strawberry or black milk tea. We got the black milk tea and it was EXCELLENT! Very pronounced tea flavour, not too sweet and the soft serve is not too overpowering with milk/cream flavour like other soft serve places (my personal preference). The oreo cookie bits and corn flake bits really added a lot of great texture to balance out the ice cream, so this is HIGHLY recommended. 

Overall I would definitely visit again due to the relaxing atmosphere, and the value is very high for the amount they charge. Our bill came to $20 per person before tips. I would also like to mention that the service really stood out. The gentleman that served us that night was just wonderful and made us feel truly welcomed and relaxed and I hope they continue to uphold this level of customer service in the future as I will be returning soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious. The drinks were made just right. The karage and takoyaki were delectible and their main courses were great. 

I would reccomend this place to anyone who enjoys japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"When this place opened it was really charming - the atmosphere is still cute but it feels like the owners are penny pinching. The food is not bad, but all of the meats/fish as sliced SUPER THIN. It's about $7 for tuna tataki - the amount of tuna you get it like one and half pieces of sashimi at other restaurants. At  our last visit the waiters didn't bring any tea or water for the table."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is super cute with mismatch chairs, bowls, cups, and utensils. Done tastefully and not trashy. It is quite spacious so you most likely get a table.

I've been a several times and noticed the female servers aren't as friendly as the males. All in all, the service is still decent.

You won't find your staple Japanese food here such as rolls/sashimi, but a Japanese fusion of food in the rice & ramen category. I love the eel rice because they give you a big chunk it. The drinks that they offer are refreshing especially the lemonade and matcha drinks.

Pricing is fairly reasonable, works out to be about $15 per person including a drink."}
{"text":"Food was just average. I think the food are a bit too expensive. Its nice to try it out but i won't go there again. One time is good enough"}
{"text":"This place was hard to find. ..been driving around the parking lot looking for a spot to park and trying to find the restaurant at the same time. In the end,  had to call in for directions. The interior looks pretty nice inside. Service was really slow. ..they directed us to a table but didn't give us the menu. The food was pretty tasty but portions was too small. ..not worth the price. Would come for happy hour though"}
{"text":"The food is pretty average and the portions are huge, but the food takes a long time to come. I would recommend the avocado and crab meat rice, tempura shrimp with curry rice, and the unagi rice. Tried ice cream here once, nothing really special about it. I tried the taro soft serve. Tastes like artificial flavours and colours. I watched the server eat some while making the one for me.  

Once a year type thing for me. Nothing very special, not a lot of variety, and but the servers are very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Moji never dissapoints! The interior of this restaurant is so beautiful and the service is always top quality. The servers are so kind and really care about your experience. I love their UDON with seafood tempura as it's light in flavour and not overly seasoned or flavourful. Tempura is perfectly battered and you get a good variety of pieces."}
{"text":"Moji is a great place to grab some noodles!
Ramen, udon, and a good selection of rice bowls!

I had the unagi udon which was delicious. 
A good sized portion!
I didn't eat the cantelope or corn but it's cool. 

The karaage was like tempura chicken. Dark meat with batter with mayo. Not bad - but not life changing. 

They served me first and it took a really long time to serve my friend.  However, we reminded them that we were missng noodles and the order came out shortly. 

Overall, I'd be back. The space is bright and fun. It's family friendly which is great so everyone can hang out!! :)"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place received such hype, it's very very mediocre that I won't even consider coming back because there's just way better food out there in Markham that deserves your time and money.

Food:
Fried chicken udon - soup base is very blended that you can probably make better at home yourself if you buy a pack of decent frozen udon from T&T. Fried chicken is not bad, but portion is TINY for meat...

Beef on rice with mayo - whole bowl of rice with so little beef on top, can't even finish the rice

Takoyaki - so so, the octopus inside is so small 

Drinks are free, come with the meals during happy hour 2-530pm or so. Drinks are decent, their lemonade is refreshing. I could come back for the drinks, but definitely not for the food.

Service is slow and servers have zero smile on their face, typical Asian places that wouldn't even try to please you. $30 for everything I wrote above I guess you can say you get what you pay for. 

Left feeling unsatisfied unfortunately :("}
{"text":"I'd say 3 1/2 stars.  The food was good, though simple.  Could've been a buck or two cheaper.  Decor was nice... Kind of had the Muji style that the restaurant name mimics.  But the big draw for me next time is the big clean space & the possibility to put the tables together to accommodate larger crowds.  Instant family friendly space.  Very comfy."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and it is definitely something I'd go back for as well as recommended. My only problem is probably the price as it was a little pricey, but it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Purposely wanted to try this place out.  Walked in and ordered. Waited for 45 mins and the waitress came to our table and asked us if we ordered anything.  Being pretty hungry by then, we just walked out and went to a place that would actually serve food."}
{"text":"The cute decor was definitely what attracted me to this restaurant in the first place. Moji is a cute restaurant with a different menu consisting of homey items such as udon, rice bowls, ramen, and snacks. They also have a great drink and dessert menu. We ordered takoyaki for our appetizer, they were good but nothing spectacular. For our mains, we got the curry chicken udon and the chicken karaage udon. These were both very flavourful and well presented. Portion sizes were good for me, my boyfriend ordered extra udon noodles for his curry chicken udon. There were a few pieces of fruit in my broth, it was unique and I enjoyed it. My favourite of the night was definitely dessert, we got the taro parfait and it was a great dessert to share. 

Will return in the future if I'm close by and craving some udon. Parking in the plaza though can be a nightmare due to all the restaurants in the area. I would also come back for happy hour because I know they have some good combos for cheap!"}
{"text":"Both my dad me got sick after eating here this afternoon. My dad had diarrhea and I puked.  We believe its from the cold taro milk tea we had today."}
{"text":"Last night I came here with my family and I think I should read the reviews before I came here.

Food: average ..portion quite small
The main thing was after the food,my husband got a serious diarrhea and vomiting. We went to Stouffville hospital overnight.

Service: zero! One of the waitress,she has no expression at all. Haven't say a word. She even didn't look at us when she came to take our orders.

For all of these, we would never ever come again!"}
{"text":"The food doesn't taste that great. I got noodles, would not recommend /: 
Other than that the... tableware was cute and I was able to draw on the mirror!"}
{"text":"This is a really cute Japanese Eatery located in the plaza south of Highway 7 on Kennedy. Once you walk in, you'll notice the super cute decor. All the cups, plates, and chairs in here are mismatched but follow the same theme. Super cute. 

We ordered the Takoyaki as a starter to share for 2, the Tobiko Cheese Unagi Rice and the Chicken Karaage Rice. This was more than enough food for lunch. The Unagi Rice was super flavourful and the unagi pieces are very large! DEFINITELY recommend this dish. The takoyaki dish came with 6 octopus balls. And the Chicken Karaage Rice was basically a fried chicken dish. Each of the mains also came with a bowl of miso soup. 

Overall, I think the portions are very large and it was worth the price. The food itself is also very flavourful and delicious. Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant a few times to give it a fair review.  It is a \"you get what you pay for\" kind of restaurant.  You do  get value for your food  but don't expect quality.  The service is lacking and I got the overall sense of feeling that they are under staffed.   This is not the place to go for quality food.  On the plus side, there is lots of room between tables."}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars and -1 star for extremely slow service.

The decor of the restaurant is nice, very spacious and completely renovated from the previous Nak Won. Unfortunately, my group and I did not have a pleasant experience during our visit. 

We visited Moji on a Friday afternoon for lunch after reading all the positive reviews. The restaurant was at approximately 50% capacity. We were quickly seated and were also able to place our orders right away. However, after placing our orders, we noticed that there were about 3 other tables who looked like they were waiting for their food as well. 

Food slowly arrived at one or two of the other tables, and we watched these tables finish their meals, pay, and leave, yet we were still waiting for our meals. It took over 45 minutes for our food to arrive.  As we did not not plan to spend 2 hours on a simple donburi lunch, we ended up having to pack our entire meal.

We notified the waitress approximately 30 minutes after waiting that we were slightly in a rush, and needed to get take out boxes and our drinks to go (drinks cost an additional $2 to add on). As both the kitchen and the bar area are visible, we could tell our meals and drinks were not ready yet. We asked her again approximately 10 minutes later if our drinks were being made yet, she said no and told us she would cancel them for us if we were in a rush. That was fine (even though we all wanted to try the drink), but our entire party ordered the same drink, a matcha milk tea, and making these types of drinks does not take much time if a restaurant is prepped properly.

Overall, we wanted to love the place, but couldn't, not at this point in time anyway. At only 50% capacity, food service for what they offer was ridiculously slow, and both kitchen and wait staff were under-staffed and/or under-trained. The only staff who seemed to be on top of her game was the dish washing lady. Portions are also quite small for what you pay."}
{"text":"Upon entering the 'restaurant', you immediately get a vibe that you're more at a bubble tea place rather than a restaurant. Usually that means the food is terrible, and I'm happy to say that the lunch meals are not the worst. 

However, the food is mediocre at best. I ordered a curry rice meal and while they try to be cute and put as many things in the bowl as possible, there were a few pieces of fresh fruit in there. A very weird combination of tastes and I'd rather they just served fruit separately. In the end I left the fruit there and it's just a waste. 

Moreover, since it's technically a tea cafe, i'd expect their tea to be above average.  Ordered a green tea matcha as part of the meal and it was the most watery matcha I've ever tasted. 

Overall not a pleasant meal. I will give credit that the waitress does try to be friendly and at the end of the meal there was a coupon for free ice cream."}
{"text":"Nice little simple restaurant inside Wong Kwok/ Peach Tree Plaza facing Kennedy Rd.

Simple menu with rice or noodle bowls along with some side dishes and desserts. Friendly and speedy service.

I went on a weekday for dinner, was barely half full. They also apologized for how cold the restaurant was. Even with a heater in the middle of the restaurant most people kept their jackets on while eating. Not sure if their hearing system is down or they're always that cold.

I had the following:

Seaweed salad - it was okay.

Takoyaki - pretty good, they also have tempura bits on it

Karage udon - fried chicken soup noodle, it was good.

Unagi don - eel rice was yummy. Comes with apple slices kind of cute. Served with miso soup

Matcha ice cream - green tea flavoured soft serve was good, they give you a free ice cream coupon after you have paid or if you ask them ahead they may give it to you to use the same time. (Attached photo, has expiring day)

Overall, it was a decent affordable place for a simple meal. Nothing that pops out to me though."}
{"text":"Great to hangout and grab a snack when there is space.

Food: 3/5 Food okay. Comes out cold at times. 
Service: 4/5 Efficient and friendly.
Environment: 4/5 Cute but chairs too mismatched!
Washrooms: 4/5 Okay
Worth it?: 3/5 Great for a snack. Icecream is good.

This place gets busy at times. That usually just means loud and service may slow down. I have never not gotten a seat.

Food seems to have gone down hill. During my last visit some of our food came out cold. Edamame also could have been cooked longer. Portion size is also on the smaller side and I would say it's better for a snack rather than dinner. 

Soft serve ice cream is good. Something I would go back for. The matcha green tea soft serve was very yummy!

The decide is okay. Very Instagramable with cute decorations but the mismatch chairs annoy me. Sticking to one design in different colors would ha e been nice. Modern plastic chairs with clunky wooden ones is just a mess. 

I will come back for the icecream. I do hope the food quality gets better tho."}
{"text":"Moji cafe is so cute, I love their pinterest inspired decor inside.
Food: ordered the curry shrimp tempura rice and chocken karage rice.  Both were yummy and came with a good portion of rice.  I liked the curry one more because the sauce made the rice more yummy once you are done eating the toppings.
Also had ice-cream in the tea flavour and it was delicious.  I think it tasted like softserve chattime!
Price: range from $9 to $14 and comes with miso soup.  Drink +$2.
I will be back again to try some apps.  Come early on the weekend, they are super busy by 1pm."}
{"text":"Came to Moji on a weekend evening without a reservation. We were lucky we came around 6:30 pm when there were still a few empty tables. By 7:00 pm, there's already a line up.

We were seated and given menus with a piece of paper to write down our choices. I ordered the curry shrimp tempura rice and our group shared the ebi shrimp and takoyaki cheese. We also ordered the a drink for an extra 2$. Overall, the food was pretty good and the portions were average. The drink wasn't anything special though.

In terms of the service, I think the restaurant is seriously understaffed. There were only 2 people in the kitchen and the food was coming out very slowly. Also there were not enough servers that it would take very long if you needed anything. It wasn't the fault of the staff, there just weren't enough of them. The air conditioning was also lacking especially on a hot summer day.

We finished off the dinner with a matcha and taro soft serve ice cream which is highly recommended! I would definitely return for the food, but the service could use some improvement!"}
{"text":"Very cute Pinterest-esque/DIY inspired Japanese restaurant serving an array of snacks, mains, desserts and a selection of specialty drinks.

They were pretty packed for a Sunday night but the wait for a table of two (10-15 minutes) was not too bad. We ordered the wasabi takoyaki, chicken karage, unagi rice and a pork ramen. We had the option to add $2 for a drink so we got the ice Japanese Genmaicha green tea and the rose calpis - both very refreshing and went well with our meal.

I really enjoyed the karage chicken and the pork from the ramen - the ramen itself was so-so. The unagi rice came with a miso soup (a bit too salty for my liking) and it was a very generous portion. The wasabi takoyaki wasn't anything special.

I would definitely come back for more chicken karage and try their desserts in the future!"}
{"text":"Something different in the area :) 

Ordered takoyaki, gyu udon, and buta mayo don. Takoyaki was great! Crispy on the outside. Would have preferred a little more sauce though. Gyo udon and buta mayo don was alright. 

They gave out coupons for free soft serve when we asked for the bill. We used it right away and got one matcha soft serve and one taro soft serve. Both were great! Yay free ice cream!"}
{"text":"Moji is such a cute restaurant to try to if you ever want to go somewhere different. The decor is very random but in a hipster way. All the chairs are different, all the cups are different and its just this really interesting vibe overall. 

The servers are very friendly and always feel free to ask them any questions you may have. 

The food is where I got a little lost because i wasn't sure where to start. They have 2 pages of seafood items and unfortunately i don't eat seafood so i felt like my choices were limited. This place is really great for lunch as they have lunch specials and I had the pork udon which I thought was delicious. 

A restaurant you definitely want to try at least once?"}
{"text":"I get excited whenever a Japanese restaurant opens up near my house so I jumped with excitement when I saw this place all over my instagram! We came here for a quick meal and some drinks. The meal was average, nothing that great. I was quickly disappointed as my I had such high hopes."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled (like me) by the positive reviews! 

I went there for their \"happy hour\" (between 2:30pm to 5pm) $5.99 combo deal and it was as far away from a \"happy hour\" as it could possibly be. Wait time of 10 to 15 minutes is to be expected, BUT the wait time is not due to a lack of table, rather it was the lack of attention given to you by the waiter/waitresses. I am serious, you can stand there for eons and they would not come to you and ask how many people or put your name on the waiting list or what-have-you.

The menus (happy hour + regular dessert menu) is nothing extraordinaire. In fact, I find it very lackluster with the options available. It certainly did not help that my \"supernormal\" oreo icecream was limited to just milktea flavour and after 30 minutes waiting, they told me their machine is broken and after another 10 minutes waiting they reported only strawberry flavour is left available. For nearly 5 bucks, this is as limited as it can get!

So what about the happy hour meals? As to be expected, nothing impressive. Neither the size nor the taste stands out which I suppose is good enough for a star (the other star comes from the decor). No water for the entire 2 hours there and I would not have been given any utensils had I not ask for them. 

Oh and did I mention cash/debit only? Never will I be fooled again! Take heed!"}
{"text":"Service was quick and the drinks and ice cream were tasty! I came here twice on a Sunday for lunch and dinner. I had the taro milk tea for $2 and tried the ginger fruit tea for dinner which didn't taste too good.

For appetizers, the octopus balls and grilled squid were pretty good. Grilled squid was a good size to share too.

Entrees- here is where I feel they need to improve. Quality is mediocre, I've had better and also bigger sizes and better value.  We ordered the beef rice don and the chicken teriyaki udon. Beef dish wins. If I want to eat noodle soup /udon this wouldn't be my go to place. 

Yummy soft Ice cream for dessert !"}
{"text":"Dayyyum Markham, I never knew you could taste so guuuud! Shoot! Stopped in today for lunch with my kick ass Yelp-intern Amy Z (thank YOU for introducing me to this place).

Listed as Hot and New on Yelp after only opening in January of this year, Moji is bringing affordable and fast Japanese treats to Markham in a big way. If you scan their pictures you'll see a variety of delicious rice and Udon bowls with similar proteins and flavours (regular, hot, curry, chicken, beef, pork, seafood, and more). In addition to a variety of tasty hot and col beverages that are absolutely delightful.

Today I simply couldn't resist ordering their Wasamayo Takoyaki (or should I say TakoYUMMY) - squid balls! While delicious the coolest part is watching how this dish appears to still be alive as the heat from the fresh takoyaki cause the bonito flakes to 'wave' back and forth. So cool and yet eerie all at the same time. I do hope it wasn't alive because it was delicious and I killed that dish in no time flat.

For my main I went with the spicy beef udon bowl and holy smokes, what flavour. And what a generous serving of perfectly cooked udon and beef adorned with enoki mushrooms, corn, edamame and even 2 slices of cantaloup (I thought that was odd) but wow how perfect that worked with the spicy broth and savoury beef. N..O..M... NOM!

And when I thought it couldn't get any better, the simplest thing (the fruit green tea) totally surprised me. An average green tea bag plunked in hot water that was filled with fresh chopped fruit. The aromatics it provided hit me about 5 ft before the mug hit the table. Amazing (and only $2 when you purchase a meal).

Fantastic. I'll be back to try more

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Love this place !! So happy that Markham is having more and more great restaurants :)

I had the unagi don.. Reasonable price AND tasty!!

My favorite part of the meal is of course the dessert - rainbow mochi taro icecream !!

Must visit this place if you are in the area :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a late Sunday afternoon with some friends. When we got there, there were a few tables available but we weren't greeted or acknowledged by anyone working at the restaurant and was left standing at the entrance for about 10 minutes. 

Service was REALLY slow and I thought they were a bit unorganized. Ordered the grilled squid and takoyaki for appetizers - they were all mediocre. Had the buta ramen it was pretty good but personally I thought the portion was a bit small for the price and the addition of the melon in the noodles was weird. 

The restaurant overall is very bright and clean - very aesthetically pleasing. Unfortunately, I didn't have the best experience with the food or service - probably won't be returning!"}
{"text":"We had the chicken karage, takoyaki, pork & eel donburi for $50.00 with tax and drinks. Everything was excellent and succulent! We will definitely come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Came here last night on the civic holiday around 8pm, was not very busy but the food came out very slow.

The dish like many mentioned was bland, rice could of had more flavour just plain rice, pork was kinda of tasteless just overpowered by the spicy mayo drizzle. Portion wise I felt it was underwhelming. 6/10.

Side miso soup was good though and easily made. 8/10.

Next time will try the ice cream desserts."}
{"text":"Been here so many times. Great place for good (and cheap) food and a great atmosphere!! They have a happy hour special between 2:30-5pm where you can pick a main dish, appetizer, and drink for $5.99. Really good deal! Servers are super nice also. Can get fairly busy at night on weekends. This restaurant is closed on Tuesdays, also."}
{"text":"Pleased with this restaurant! The interior. The music. The food. 

The interior consists of assorted chairs and wooden tables. It is very simple and cute. There are also pine tress with xmas lights on them to add a nice decor. The music was a mix of Japanese and pop songs.

Coming in for the afternoon tea around 4 PM, there were only about 4 tables seated. They brought us the water, which came covered with two cups. We ordered two afternoon tea sets for $5.99 each. The first was thespicy gyu don, 3 pcs tacoyaki, and iced passion fruit ginger tea. The second was the spicy gyu don, seaweed salad, and the hot ginger fruit tea. 

The spicy gyu don was really good. The beef was sweet and the rice was cooked well. There was also some spicy sauce on the top, as well as half of an egg, edamame, pickled ginger, and two slices of cantaloupe on the side. The cantaloupe was really sweet. 

The takoyaki was good. The outer portion was crispy and the inner portion was soft. However, there was a large hole in the middle of the takoyaki when I bit in it. Not the best takoyaki I've had, but the flavour was not bad. 

The seaweed salad was also tasty. It wasn't too salty and was even topped with some dried seaweed (nori). 

The iced passion fruit ginger tea came in a mason jar. You could taste the tea flavour with a hint of passion fruit. The ginger flavour was from the ginger bits in the tea. It was very refreshing. The hot ginger fruit tea, on the other hand, wasn't as good. I have to say, the mug was fairly large and had a cute message on it: \"you are beautiful\". There was a fruity tea taste, some ginger bits, and had a minty flavour. However, I wasn't really a fan of this drink. 

We also ordered the Matcha Special Parfait. I'm not sure if it had a twist option, but when the server asked us, \"taro or matcha?\" I said matcha because I thought you were suppose to pick one. However, upon seeing the menu and other pictures, I noticed that it was a twist of taro AND matcha. Maybe the server could have been a bit more clear. Nonetheless, the parfait was delicious! The matcha soft serve was very rich and smooth. It also had a lot of ingredients in it like two strawberry Pockys (one had a toasted marshmallow through it topped with whipped cream), a KitKat, a pandan flavoured roll, some small coloured marshmallows, a sour key, popping lychee bobas, and coffee flavoured tapioca. Inside was a surprise of some red bean paste!

Your bill also comes in a little tin can which I thought was cute. Overall, the service was quick and friendly. I was also impressed with the food. I will be back to try their other dishes, like the Unagi Don!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the clean, vibrant modernity of Moji. Makes for a very comfortable dining experience. I ordered the unagi don, but my dad let me eat some of his buta (?) pork don. Both were excellent. Well balanced flavours and good portion size. Served with a miso soup and a piece of fruit as garnish in your bowl. I was actually envious of my dad's set because the sauce used for the pork was quite addictive. 

I also ordered the fruit green tea ($2!!!!!) which was a great deal and a pretty decent size. The fragrance of the fruit was fantastic and there was no sweetener which made it very good on a cold day!

Definitely will revisit to try out their desserts. I also recently learned of their super affordable happy hour specials. Totes down to try those too!"}
{"text":"Visited this place located at Peachtree. Found out about it based on several Yelp reviews by friends. I have never been a fan of Japanese Donburi. I have to say, this place has officially converted me.

Food:
Buta Mayo Donburi on my first visit and it was very good, it came with miso soup that was not too salty like other Japanese restaurants, the dish consisted of thinly sliced pork, cantaloupes (yes odd combination but the cantaloupes was refreshing), edamame beans, and a perfectly cooked egg with a gooey yolk.

Unagi Donburi - Unagi was also very good and highly recommended, the portions they give are surprisingly generous relative to other Japanese restaurants. 

Side order - Chicken Karaage - fried to perfection & topped with spicy mayo, the chicken was very tender and juicy inside 

At first the portions seemed small as I have a big appetite but the bowl was deceiving and it filled me up.

Drinks:
I ordered the iced peach green tea (only $2!!), it was by far one of the best drinks I've had... better than Cha Time!

3rd and 4th Visit:
On my 3rd and 4th visit the food quality seemed to have decreased a little: the food became a bit too salty and the chicken karaage portions have decreased. (-1 star because of this)

I would visit again to try other rice bowls and I have yet to try their icecream.
The only caveat I have is they do not serve hot green tea (at least not for free)."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. The first time me and friends came it was when they first opened. So there were slow orders. We came back again this time and it seemed everything was good. My only complaint is that for the price I would expect larger potions. A whole lot of rice and not a lot of meat. It was delicious, but small."}
{"text":"Decided to visit this restaurant as I was craving Takoyaki and didn't want to line up 1hr for Takoyaki at Taste of Asia. We ordered 2 happy hour sets, one order of takoyaki, and one order of agedashi tofu.  The food was okay, they put seaweed and mayo on 3/4 of our dishes, so it kind of started to taste all the same.

On to the service, somehow the waitress failed to enter in one happy hour combo after confirming with her what we wrote down. So my bf got his food after I was done eating.... this was very disappointing considering there was only 1 other seated table in the entire restaurant, so it was not busy at all."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0

They've added a new server for a total of 4 people working the frontline. Service was a bit quicker because of this. I believe they recognize what needs improvement so hopefully they will continue to fine tune their service."}
{"text":"Moji is a rustic modern-looking Japanese restaurant which offers mostly rice bowl, udon and limited choices of dessert and drinks. We decided to go to Moji after we checked on Yelp and saw those lovely Mochi Ice-cream pictures. However, the server told us there was a lack of demand for Rainbow Mochi ice-cream, Red bean & Mochi Ice cream and Ice-cream Screamer, they have discontinued these three desserts. I was actually quite disappointed since my original intention to goto Moji was to try two of these three options. Anyways, we still ordered a Gyudon (Thin sliced beef rice bowl), Buta Udon (thin slice pork in udon soup), matcha ice cream and taro ice cream. 

We liked the flavor for the rice bowl and udon bowl. It tasted like something my mother would cook for me, very warm and hearty. I found it weird that they put two slices of cantaloupe in the beef bowl, which didn't really match well with the rest of the bowl. I think it would be better if they can put it separately. Also, for the udon soup, I found it weird to have the edamame inside my udon soup. I think it should taste better if they can put it in a separate small bowl for appetizer instead. 

I am not a big fan of their ice-creams. The taro flavor did not taste like the actual taro ice-cream. It taste like they mixed some cream base products with the taro flavored tapioca powder. It tasted very sweet. We couldn't taste anything from the matcha flavor ones and it was very bland. We would recommend them to add more matcha powder in the ice-cream for a stronger flavor. Also, the ice cream melts relatively faster than other ice creams places we have been to. We felt like we need to finish the ice cream asap to prevent everything turns into liquid. 

I would still come back for the rice bowl/udon bowl since the price was acceptable and the food taste pretty good. However, we will not order dessert from them unless they improve the flavor of the ice cream. Aside from the dessert issue, I will give Moji a 4 star!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was is under new management when I went. Wait time was very long for the food. I got the eel donbouri which was full of bones. I guess new boss is using cheap quality. Ebi mayo shrimp was one of my favourite, shrimp was pretty big. Karrage was decent as well. Was offer ice cream on the house but was a disappointment as it was not creamy, was more icy"}
{"text":"Cute little eatery with simple Japanese food and good service. The decor inside has a very whimsical and trendy feel to it. The restaurant also seems very clean. I ordered the spicy chicken chashu rice. The soft boiled eggs and uruchimai rice complimented well with the smoky chicken chashu! But I think there should've been more of the chicken. The ratio of rice and chicken was like 3:1 . Luckily I went there during happy hour 2:30-5:30, and ordered a free cold genmaicha bubble tea, which was very fragrant and  refreshing. The desserts are also pretty good. I had the Black Milk tea soft serve ice cream. Enough said. Recommended to come with friends because there's good simple, cheap food with light desserts. Basically \"Killing 2 birds with 1 stone\". Will come again."}
{"text":"Came in with a Group of 4. The ambiance of the place is very relaxed and a great atmosphere. The staff was very nice and comforting.

The food itself tasted very good and for a really good price. I got the Chicken Karaage, which came with soup and a free drink (since it was with a meal, the iced peach lemonade is for recommend as a drink). Even just got a $1 I got some curry which tasted very good.

We came mostly for the dessert and we got the matcha and milk tea twist covered in oreos which wasn't too sweet but fulfilled our Ice cream needs

Overall the amount of food, quality and price had me give this place a 5 star"}
{"text":"Came here with a couple friends and really enjoyed the experience. Always up for some Japanese food that isn't AYCE!

First thing you notice when you walk in is the creative and beautiful use of the space. With mirrors on one wall, the restaurant seems to be massive! Even though it isn't as big as it seems, the use of space and decor is on point. The tables are decorated minimally and the chairs ate very unique. All the chairs at each table seem slightly different, giving it a very modern vibe. 

The menu is quite simple. One side is main dishes and the other side is appetizers, drinks, and desserts. I have tried a few items now, and everything has been quite good! I'm going to highlight some of the ones I really enjoyed:
The Don are all quite good, beautifully presented and delicious as well. For a meal under $10, the portions are quite good too! I would recommend either on of the Gyu Don or the Buta Don as they were amazing. They also have a choice of rice or udon, which helps change things up. Coming with a miso soup, ordering just a don would fill you up!
For some appetizers, the Cheese Corn was really good, with a sauce that was a perfect pair. The Chilled Tofu was amazing as well, with good quality tofu. The Wasamayo Crispy Takoyaki was amazing as well! On par with something you find at a traditional market.
For drinks, their hot teas are amazing. Had a bit of a throat tickle, and the Mixed Fruit Ginger Tea was the perfect solution. For dessert, their Matcha Ice Cream was a good balance without being too bitter. We also got the Rainbow Mochi Ice Cream to share, but it was really small and just felt like the regular ice cream.

Service here is amazing. Staff were really nice and friendly, though it did seem like they had the bare minimum staff at all times. However, they provide you will free ice cream vouchers for each person that comes for your next visit, so that is definitely a plus and incentive to come again. 

Loved this restaurant, as it had great food with nice presentation and a wonderful environment. Definitely going to make my way back!"}
{"text":"i got the chicken wonton noodles and it was almost $13, even tho it was a special price and i rate it 3/5 on the yummy scale. it just tastes like wonton noodles u can make at home
my friend got the vegetarian tempura and it was $15 and he says it was yummy and he rates it 3.5/5 waitress was also a little rude and there was literally only one person serving that afternoon 
this place is expensive and it is not that yummy i would not go again"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and it was pretty busy with only a couple tables left. I was able to get a table right away which was nice. I really liked the decor of the place and everything looked new and clean.

For a starter I tried the squid balls. They were ok but just not my thing. I ordered the tempura shrimp and vegetables with udon soup noodles. The soup was a miso base and was pretty tasty. The hubs ordered the curry udon with tempura shrimp and it was just okay. The curry taste like the kind you can make at home. They have a special where you can add a drink for $2 with purchase of a meal. I got the green tea with fruit (hot drink) and it was delicious!!! The aroma from the bits of passion fruit and berries was out of this world!!

Good service and we didn't have to wait too long for the food. They even have an afternoon 2-5pm special on weekdays that sounded really good. Will def be back to try more items!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my go-to places whenever I just feel snackish. I've been for lunch, happy hour and dinner and have always had a great time. 

The ambiance is quiet. It's great for both small and big groups. The first time I came was with another Yelper who recommended I try Moji. I'm so happy it didn't disappoint because the decor is super cute and it's a pretty nice place to hang out with a few friends. 

My favourite drink on the menu is the Rose Calpis which is sweet and light. Perfect with a bowl of noodles or rice. My personal favourite is the curry tofu with edamame. I don't think the spicy edamame is worth trying because it's literally siracha drizzled on top and I found there was too much. The spice was definitely overpowering. 


Takoyaki here is also very tasty as are desserts! I definitely would recommend this place. Happy hour menu is super cheap and the portions are a decent size. :)"}
{"text":"This is a really cute Japanese restaurant. They have modern decor, friendly staff and a cool menu. 

Already decided that I was having an avocado crabmeat on rice because I wanted something light. It was okay, the ingredients were fresh but just feels like it was missing something maybe some wasabi mayo with tobiko. I was saving my stomach for the soft serve I was really looking forward to it. Ordered it in a cup but it was underwhelming. The flavors were just not rich enough that is always the issue. I really hope they can improve on this! They also offer taro soft serve but I didn't try it, I heard it's better. Also had their takoyaki, it was also okay. I've definitely had better. The actual takoyaki was nice and hot but it was definitely lacking some sauce and mayo. I want lots! And I was mislead when I ordered takoyaki with cheese I thought the cheese was inside . But they just put some shredded cheese underneath and they didn't really melt so it was a bit weird. 

I really want to come back and try the curry, it looks good. Just a few tweaks with the food and they will be perfect."}
{"text":"Great food, attentive service and cute decor. The food we ordered were all above average. 

We came in a group of 7 on a Wednesday night. I ordered the pork ramen. Soup base was flavourful and noodle was has the perfect slightly chewy texture. The pork however was a bit too soft and thin that taste like the over marinated it. The drink I ordered was a iced rose calpis (Japanese yogurt drink with rose petals and syrup). Was a little disappointed when they said they. No longer serve taro soft serve. I heard a lot of compliment online about their soft serve ice cream and the flavour they currently carry are matcha and black milk tea. The server said they changes the flavours every few months. The takoyaki (not in picture) was okay but it's fried instead of grilled which is not the authentic and tastier was to prepare it. This restaurant closes at 9 on weekdays and last call was 8:20 so it might not be a good choice for after dinner dessert with friends. 

Overall it's a restaurant's that worth to visit if you like Japanese cafe style food. I will come back and hopefully they will have some great ice cream flavours!"}
{"text":"Good, casual location for Japanese fusion with a variety of donburi and udon to choose from! By far, the best value would be any of the set meals; either the lunch or all day ones which come with a slightly smaller entrée, small side dish, and drink. At such a low cost, you can afford to add on an appetizer; I highly would recommend the takoyaki, which was moist and flavourful with interesting toppings. Of all the entrees, I would recommend the gyuu with rice, over the chicken, as I have found the chicken quite dry and unflavourful in past, contrasting the moist and flavourful gyuu. In the past, I have found all the dishes to consistently have a flavourful sauce, from the curries, to the spicy selection. Furthermore, I would recommend the rice as a base, as the udon has been very chewy with poor texture in the past. The variety of drinks is quite interesting, so don't be afraid to dabble with a drink such as a rose capris; which has rose petals in it! Relaxed ambiance, it is a nice place to go to catch up with friends over some decent food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Moji lives up to the hype when it comes to the ice cream.  The matcha and taro soft serve was rich in flavour and not overly sweet.   It could be a bit more creamy, but I'd definitely eat the ice cream again.   The Spicy gyu udon was okay, the portions felt a bit small for the value.   We also tried out time wasamayo takoyaki which was delicious but a bit pricy.   Overall, this new Japanese restaurant is worth a try but in my opinion is a bit expensive for meal."}
{"text":"The happy hour set for $5.99 is a great deal. The portion sizes are smaller than what is served when you order off of the regular menu, but it was just enough to fill me. I tried the avocado crab rice bowl and the tempura rice bowl. Both were simple, but delicious. The drinks I tried - Berry Ginger Lemonade, Genmaicha Green Tea and the Matcha Milk Tea were standard, nothing impressive. Unless you are paying a discounted price for these drinks through a meal deal, I would skip them. The milk tea and taro ice cream were also average, a little too sweet for my liking. Moji's happy hour deal will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised. When you first walk in there is a huge mirror wall with customer's drawings and writings on it, I thought that was super cute. It had a small urban cafe feel to it, but the size of the restaurant was quite big and very spacious and clean looking.
It had quite a small menu but a nice variety of foods. I got the tofu avocado salad and the spicy beef rice, my husband got the unagi rice, my friends got the tofu avocado salad and the edamame and the spicy beef udon and the beef tataki.
The food tasted amazing! And the portions were definitely filling.
The rice dishes all come with a side of Miso soup which was very nice.
I think my favourite dishes were the unagi and the avocado salad, partially because those are two of my favourite foods.
I definitely recommend everyone to come to try this place!"}
{"text":"I love coming here! Their main dishes are delicious. We got a vegetable soup and shrimp tempura combo. I liked how each dish came with a side, like my vegetable soup came with vegetable tempura. It was such a nice treat after a night of skating.   

The service is great. They gave lots of recommendations since it was our first time. They are super welcoming to all different cultures, even though their dishes are mainly east Asian. 

I wish they had more variety of desserts. The ones they gave was very yummy. We got the caramel popcorn black tea ice cream and the supernormal Oreo mix."}
{"text":"Cute Cafe!

I loved the simple design of the store as well as the dishes! I got the karage chicken rice with mayo and seaweed. It came with a miso and by adding two dollars you get a drink. I got the strawberry calpris yogurt drink. Sweet and sour goodness! After the meal I ordered a match twist mango sundae with oreo. Light and creamy. The mango went surprisingly well with the matcha. I rarely go to peach tree centre but now that I have discovered the place I will definitely go more"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant but they could definitely use some improvements. The interior is all hipster looking and some of the decor is probably DIY Pinterest worthy, but I found the layout to be cluttered and poorly organized. The space is large but the seating arrangements are too close together and felt really squishy.  

Another area of concern was that the food took a really long time to come and was served lukewarm. I found that highly unappetizing, especially because I had a soup base. I had ordered a teriyaki chicken udon and on top of it being cold, I also found the overall dish to be lacking in flavour. They also put cantaloupe slices into the udon and I still have mixed feelings about that.. I mean, I love my fruits but I'm not sure I like them when they're soaked in cold udon broth. 
The karaage that we ordered as an appetizer was only okay as well. The chicken meat itself was tender and delicious but I found the batter to be too heavily breaded. Many of the pieces were more batter than actual chicken.

The oreo ice cream was visually appealing but taste-wise, was only mediocre. Word of warning, their \"blueberry ice cream\" tasted nothing like blueberries - it was more minty than anything.

From my experience, this place has average prices for average food. My partner however, who had the curry tempura shrimp, really enjoyed it so perhaps I'll be back again for another review."}
{"text":"Like some of the comments said this place is over priced with minimal service. In other words, small portion of food, expensive and nothing special compared to other Japanese restaurant. The takoyaki taste the same as those Japanese all you can eat place, which taste like pre-made frozen takoyaki. I came here for mochi dessert because i saw people check in at this restaurant on Instagram and fb. So sad they i noticed they no longer serve mochi anymore. So, what is the point to come?"}
{"text":"We've been eating at this place for almost two years. Great value afternoon snack options. After two years eating here I found that u can rarely go wrong at Moji. Everything on the menu are pretty good, except the ice creams. Do not order any ice cream at Moji - or least the durian ice cream. It's tasteless and the ice cream tastes pretty artificial:("}
{"text":"I loved the overall atmosphere of the restaurant. I was pretty sold on the fact that they had mismatched chairs. On top, I thought it was very creative that the drinks menu was written on a plank of wood. The food was decent, I wouldn't say it's anything too spectacular; it's average. $2 was enough for you to add a hot or cold drink to your meal, which was a great price. I had their matcha milk tea and once again, it was just average. (I felt like I could have made the same thing at home with a mix from my local supermarket) My least favourite part was the desert. While the matcha ice-cream has strong green tea flavour, the taro one was rather mediocre. It tasted just like powdered bubble tea, which I'm not a fan of. Their mochi lacked flavour, size and texture. I wouldn't recommend those."}
{"text":"Good service and short wait times. Food is very tasty. A must try when you're around Markham. The ambiance makes you feel like you're in a Japanese cafe."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Service was horrible. 
The flavours in the udon broth was nothing special, but it did satisfy my craving and had good additions like the egg and edamame (karaage udon). 
I got the twist of matcha and taro soft serve. It was melting very quickly, but came in a nice presentation. The flavour of both components, especially the taro was quite weak. 
The service was worst of all. The waitresses looked like they were never looking at the seating area and were averting their eyes doing other tasks even though it wasn't busy. It took forever to get the bills."}
{"text":"Moji is a cute hipster restaurant in Markham that serves mediocre food but good desserts.

I tried the beef bowl and it comes with miso soup. The beef bowl tasted ok and the portion was on the smaller side. The onions were not soft enough, the egg was cold and I thought the sweet melons were oddly placed within the savoury dish.

I also tried their soft serve twist (green tea and taro). Their soft serve flavour changes every month and I'm glad I got to try the taro flavour. The taro flavour was delicious and I would order it again. 

Other than their soft serves, I would probably not dine here again."}
{"text":"Been here couple of times. They don't have a big selection, but if you are looking for simple meal - this place is pretty good! Their portion is quite big - they don't look that much when they first arrive, but the bowl is pretty steep, so don't let that deceive you! 

I usually get the chicken or beef rice - and of course a side! And try their giner fruit tea. LOVE IT!!!

I haven't yet tried their ice cream or their dessert menu yet.... I usually get way too full after my main course. 

I'll try to save room next time! They are usually pretty quick with their order - but last then I went they were full house, so it took awhile to get our food. 

Overall - I will come back for more!"}
{"text":"The food is OK for somebody looking to try something different. I feel like the food can be improved, as some dishes seem nearly too simplistic. Simplicity is completely fine, but the flavours also seemed \"overly simplistic\". There wasn't much taste. I believe I'm in their target demographic too, but do I see myself coming back regularity? I would have to say no despite the comfortable and welcoming atmosphere.

Take my review with a pinch of salt; I enjoy experimental dishes with bold and unique styles, with complementing flavours and attention to detail."}
{"text":"I used to love this place and I can't believe how bad it's gotten. I used to get there gyudon every time - but now it's so bland it's like I'm just getting plain beef on rice. They even cheaped out on the edamame and cantaloupe compared to before. I've waited at least an hour the last two times I came for food. If this keeps up they'll lose all their repeat customers. They've definitely lost me at least."}
{"text":"The miso soup was bland and watery.  Its consistency and lack of flavour reminded me of the Chinese soups that are served as part of a complimentary soup during set dinners.

The Unagi Rice contained a really big chunky piece of unagi (eel).  I really liked how meaty it was.  It was also covered with lots of unagi sauce which I liked.  There was also a half of a soft-boiled egg, and edamame and cantaloupe which I found a little odd to have in a unagi rice bowl.  The rice was a little mushy and it wasn't Japanese rice.

The Curry Gyu Udon also had edamame and cantaloupe in addition to the soft-boiled egg, tofu, enoki mushrooms, and a corn cob (random).  The udon was regular udon and covered with Japanese curry (that tasted like the cube-shaped store-brought ones).  Thus, it wasn't very good.  The curry clumped with the udon and there was nothing really spectacular about it.  The curry wasn't spicy."}
{"text":"Visited Sun March 26 for dinner. 
Group of 13.  

Pros
They accept reservations!
This place deserves a much higher rating, the food and desserts are amazing! 
Free wifi!i 
Pork Ramen - Beautifully presented, the pork comes cold on the side.
Spicy udon - Was not that spicy, broth was very flavourful. 
Chicken karage - Came with about 8 pieces, fresh and tasty.
They recently changed their menu in Jan 2017, ignore menu photos from 2016 and previous. 

Cons
Ordering was a bit ghetto, we just wrote our order on a piece of paper. It would have been nice if a server was there to answer questions and then bring the right food to the right person. You can imagine how long it took for people to remember or recognize what we ordered. They use a numbering system, and most people remember the food not the numbering system.
Since it's a large mall, it can be tough to find parking. 


Protip - Their soft-serve flavours rotate every few months, currently Matcha and Milk Tea. Durian and Taro soft-serve flavours will come back in the future. 

Damage - $30 pre-tax."}
{"text":"Very spacious. Its OK to bring car seats but no change table for babies. Servers are really friendly. Food is good. Love the matcha milk tea! Service was quick which is great since we were running on a tight schedule. Bathroom was clean and bright."}
{"text":"4.5/5.0
I absolutey loved this place!!! The only reason why I'm deducting 0.5 is the fact that their menu is so small for such a delicious place! I would come here all the time if they had more things to choose from...perhaps they'll expand? But for now, I'll expand on what I was able to taste.
First off, this place gets busy! ..Well, at least for dinner on a Friday night. I was lucky enough to grab a table minutes before the restaurant flooded with guests and there was a small line up at the door. I did overhear a waiter asking guests if they had a reservation though so perhaps that's an easy option especially if you are expecting to have a larger table.
The decor of this place was so cute. Yes, I'm using the word cute. From the decorations on the wall to the awesome looking light fixures. Although it was a little strange to see a few Halloween decoration up along with their Christmas decorations. Maybe they'll just keep adding to it as each holiday/occassion passes. But I really liked how spacious it was. It was fairly big and they didn't try and cram a million chairs and tables just to maximize on seating. I felt very comfortable.
Onto the food. Our table ordered their spicy ramen which I was told was quite good except for the fact that my guest did not find it spicy whatsoever. Other than that, it was good. The eel rice was very good as well and they did not skimp out on the piece of eel you get. I got the crabmeat and avocado rice bowl and I wish I had one right now as I am writing this review. I have been craving poke bowls and I've got to say, this hit the spot as I am not fortunate enough to be travelling downtown lately so this did the trick. There was enough of each ingredient in this dish which I am very happy about as usually I only get a couple chuncks of avocado and usually there's more rice than anything in these rice bowls. YUM I WANT MORE!
Drinks: hot matcha tea was very good and served in a very large cup. The peach and rose calpis were very delicious too. What's rose calpis? That's what I said, so I ordered it to see for myself. It was only $2 when you order and entree so why not. And I personally would like to say that I slightly tasted like lychee with a hint of rose fragrance at the end. I liked it. Don't be thrown off by it's name!
Dessert: BLACK MILK TEA SOFT SERVE. that is all. 
LOVE THIS PLACE! Did I mention that?"}
{"text":"We came for dinner tonight and I cannot understand why this place has such good reviews.  The food basically tasted and looked like homemade food that any competant chef could rustle up themselves.  In fact, my homemade japanese curry (glico brand), tasted exactly the same as what I had tonight.  

We ordered a Gyu don, Buta mayo don and a chicken curry don.  The rice bowls all came with a small bowl of miso.  The rice bowls weren't a large size, you need to order extra snacks or dessert, for a filling dinner.  We ordered the takoyaki, they weren't cooked through properly and were still a bit doughy inside.  The chicken karage was tiny pieces of chicken surrounded by a big piece of batter.  I could cook better fried chicken.  I wouldn't recommend either of these dishes.  We each ordered a drink too.  My 2 fellow diners were not impressed with their peach calpis or strawberry cream.  I thought my passion fruit & ginger tea was nice, with the fresh ginger floating in it. 

It is worth going once, for a try,  but not somewhere to frequent for dinner.  It cost us $55 inc tax and tips, there's plenty of better places to eat at for that amount."}
{"text":"First of all, the design of this place is super unique and cute. I love it since it's so unusual and different from other similar places. The cutlery and chairs are all different but adds so much fun and personality!

Food wise everything came quick and the taste was great. Presentation was clean and simple, it was just a bit on the pricey side. Definitely worth coming back."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and I anticipated a bit more of a crowd and slower service but I did not expect it to be that slow. We were seated immediately and we ordered within 10 minutes but we sat there for at least 45 minutes before our food came. The food was good but definitely did not deserve a 45 minute wait, we waited for so long my party was no longer really hungry. at the end they offered free ice cream which is a nice a bonus and they even have taro soft serve ice cream which is very rare to find. 

If I were to go again it would be on a weekday for sure."}
{"text":"Trying this place out for the first time since we were already in the plaza and our usual spot to eat \"new city\" was under renovations. We drove around the plaza and found this place. I yelped the reviews and it was good so we decided to try it out. I ordered the beef gyu and hubby ordered curry chicken. We added the grilled squid and avocado tofu. All food was good. Nothing bad to say but also nothing special to add. Portions were alright. Not big but also not too small where your left hungry. I guess it's the right amount but could have added a bit more meat to the rice opposed to more rice and less meat which I had in my bowl. He Japanese rice in my bed gyu was warm (not hot like it should be) and rice was and bit hard. I guess they keep these precooked but they should make sure rice is and ways fluffy. Other then that, nothing really to say about this place. ... price is not bad for what you get but could find better in Midtown for similar stuff. Keep improving as this place has potential. Hope they read the reviews and improve as they go along."}
{"text":"Leisure afternoon snack ? great happy hour combo deal from 2:30 -5pm. The staff here are very welcoming and nice. Food is pretty good and fairly well priced"}
{"text":"Had a great first experience! Service was so nice and so was the food. Tried the Vegetable Tempura Udon and it was great! But the best part was the Cheese Tiger Prawn appetizer! Looked and tasted AMAZING! Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Went in late at around 8:30 and was still pretty busy. Was greeted quickly and seated. I heard great things about this place for the food and dessert (mainly the soft serve). They have an assortment of teas ranging from matcha lattes to floral ginger teas, not ordinary at all.

I ordered the Unagi Don with the green tea and coco jelly to drink for $2. The main was great, big piece of eel and lots of rice to fill you up with miso soup on the side. My friend ordered the ramen, they weren't overly impressed with it as far as non ramen places go.

The dessert was the star of the show, even when I'm full, the milk tea soft serve was out of this world. I would come back just for it. I did notice they didn't give me tapioca and know some people have had it, oh well. Unfortunately they were out of taro soft serve which is something to come back for.

The place was clean including the bathrooms, nice and brightly lit dining room and the service was very friendly. I'm leaning towards a 4.5 rating."}
{"text":"Love this place! The decorations are super adorable and the servers are really sweet.

My favourite thing to get here is their ramen with pork. The ramen itself is decent, but I love the pork. I don't know what they do with it, but I think they smoke it or something because it's really flavourful. Portions are pretty big for the price tag, too. I've also tried their unagi rice and while that's not really my thing, my friend really seemed to enjoy it. Their tobiko lobster is also amazing. The perfect portion of fresh lobster to get your appetite going.

The drinks are super fun with flavours like peach lemonade and calpis. 

Will definitely go again soon! :)"}
{"text":"The seating, decoration and lighting is nice but everything else is pretty mediocre.  This is one of those places you can come with your friends and get some food and chat there for an hour but you wouldn't come JUST for the food.  I had the taro soft serve and the takoyaki.  The soft serve was really mediocre.  The flavour was just average taro and consistency is more thin than Mc Donald's soft serve.  The takoyaki was good.  Nice sauce, bonito, seaweed and terriyaki sauce mix.  Normal good takoyaki.  

I won't be coming back because, for me, the price does not equate to the food that I got but if I needed a nice place to sit for an hour to catch up with a friend and we were in that area, I would go there (if nothing better opens)."}
{"text":"The interior of Moji is essentially 200% inspired by Pinterest. From the wooden tables to the little potted plants to the pretty ceiling lights and cute wall installations, everything just screams Pinterest! It's very welcoming and cozy.

We ordered the takoyaki to start. It was a bit hard on the outside. There was a decent amount of octopus on the inside, but the batter was a bit too dense for my liking. Overall, the takoyaki was quite bland; more takoyaki sauce also could've been added for a richer taste.

Then, I had the chicken karaage rice. For such a seemingly small bowl, I was surprised by the amount of chicken in it. It also came with a soft-boiled egg (which was cold.. would've preferred it warm), edamame, pickled ginger, and a slice of cantaloupe. The chicken was tender and there wasn't too much batter. But again, even with the mayo drizzled overtop, it tasted a bit bland. The rice was a bit overcooked and dry.

My friend ordered the gyu udon. I enjoyed the udon a lot more than the rice, since it was chewy and tasty with the soup base seeped into the noodles. This dish was also served with a cantaloupe in the bowl - not sure if having a fruit drowned in soup is the best idea!

I would come back during their happy hour ($5.99 meals?!) to try their tempura udon, drinks and dessert."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend for their afternoon special (2:30-5:00pm) which was great value ($5.99) if you aren't too hungry as it comes with a smaller version of their mains, an appetizer, and a drink. 

We had the following

Buta Mayo Rice: 3.5/5
the meat and egg were delicious however the edamame was not very flavourful and I thought the addition of melon in the dish was odd.

Buta Udon: 3.5/5
Similar to the mayo rice but with noodles instead. The soup was rather bland.

Peach Calpis: 3/5
A yogurty type of drink. Not very good but maybe just not my cup of tea

Takoyaki (3pcs): 4.5/5
This alone saved the meal as the takoyaki was delicious and flavourful."}
{"text":"First off, this place is freezing. They're in the midst of replacing their heater so wear some layers or get comfortable eating with your jacket on.

We ordered the regular takoyaki ($4.95), chicken karaage don ($8.50) and the unagi don ($11.95). Presentation of dishes is great, everything looked appetizing.

Takoyaki is above average in terms of their batter to octopus ratio. Well-balanced and tasty but I would've preferred slightly more sauce (not the mayo, but the one similar to eel sauce) since it was a little plain.  

My unagi don was served with edamame, apple slices, ginger, crab stick and half a boiled egg. Before coming to Moji, I saw photos of the unagi don served with avocado instead of edamame so I was surprised when it came out different from my expectations. We asked the server and she said they often switch between the two and edamame is the \"main\" topping. Avocado is only given when they run out of the main. I thought that was weird but I was disappointed nonetheless as I had ordered it primarily because of the avocado. Was looking forward to seeing how the avocado worked with the unagi don but oh well. 

I really liked the chicken karaage which was lightly fried but the color threw me off. Typically, karaage is brown but this was more yellow. Not sure if it was under-fried or maybe the oil was fresh but it still tasted pretty good so I didn't think too much of it. At first look, it seems like a lot of meat but it ended up not being proportionate to the amount of rice. I had the same problem with my unagi don. So eat strategically or you'll be left with a lot of rice. 

They're offering free matcha soft serve icecream until January 31 so give it a try while you're there. Personally, I didn't like it at all. Lacked creaminess and I couldn't even taste the matcha flavor. 

Good place to go for lunch but I wouldn't recommend it for dinner. Portions are small so it wasn't very filling. Prices are affordable and there's a decent selection.  

My favourite was the décor. Super cute, aesthetically pleasing and very date-friendly with Japanese music blasting in the back. Their drinks menu is written on a wooden board and given to each table which really adds to the theme. Didn't get a chance to try anything but their hot chocolate with marshmallows and matcha milk tea did pique my interest. 

Basically, the decor made me feel like I was in an Asian drama the entire time."}
{"text":"Their afternoon tea deal is great for $5.99 but only available Monday to Fridays. The portion of the rice is good for me but small for the bf. Tried the taro cone. 6/10 There's not much taro flavour, is more icy than creamy and it was done in a way where there's no ice cream in the cone lol"}
{"text":"Moji is a trendy and dare I say, hipster spot for customers craving the Japanese food experience. What you'll find here is borderline-overpriced food that is average and a bit above average, at most.

Food: 3.5/5
Ordered the Happy Hour (2-5pm) Gyu-don set and a Matcha/Taro Twist, which came paired with three pieces of takoyaki and a drink of your choice from the menu. Menu selection was pretty unique, but I ended up choosing the Iced Peach Calpis. In the gyudon, there was rice with beef on top, a soft-boiled egg, two slices of cantaloupe, some edamame, and pickled ginger. The beef was slightly dry, and the soft-boiled egg was overcooked.

The takoyaki here is A+. It's reminiscent of the takoyaki in Japan and tastes authentic. The octopus serving is generous and the sauce gives an umami that makes this so worth it. I would definitely recommend this item.

I can't say much about the Iced Peach Calpis as it is a pretty standard item. Comparable to bubble tea, nothing special, but still sweet and refreshing on a hot day.

The Matcha/Taro Twist is a relatively cheap dessert. It comes in a small cup (cone, if you're getting takeout), with a Pocky stick on top. The quality of the soft serve compares toe to toe with Woofles and Cream, which is pretty above average; so I would say this is a cheaper alternative, if you're looking for a refreshing dessert to snack on.

Decor:
The decor here creates a playful and inviting environment. A variety of styles in chairs, bright colours and wooden decor really exudes the hipster, free spirit feeling. It's definitely very nice and provides a good place to eat with others. Music plays in the background, not overbearingly loud, but just enough to create a laid-back environment.

Is it worth it?
This place is definitely worth the one-try, especially for the takoyaki. I came here during Happy Hour so I couldn't expect much since it was cheaper than usual. However, I saw the price of the regular menu and the prices were quite steep for the food. I can't say about the quality of the regular menu food; if it was anything like the Happy Hour food, then it is definitely not worth the cost. I really want to give this place four stars, but the food just wasn't there."}
{"text":"I only discovered this restaurant after searching for 'dessert places' in Markham and I just want to say I absolutely adore Moji! Everything from the cute decor, food options, and friendly staff make it a 5 star establishment. Moji resembles Ikea but with a modern and trendy twist. There is a laminated menu, you write down what you want, and the staff will pick up the sheet and process your order. Ordered chicken karaage rice with miso soup for $8.95 and drinks were only $2 with a meal. I personally think this is a great deal given the fact that BBT is usually $5. 

Staff spoke Chinese and I was pleasantly surprised because I thought it was Japanese owned...but we ARE in Markham. HAHA! Quick turnaround time with the karaage and boy did it NOT disappoint. It was hot from the deep fryer and there was a generous amount of chicken to share with my friends. Drink was okay even though I asked to not have it cold, just chilled. But nothing to gripe about because the experience was fantastic.

FYI, Moji was a bit difficult to find. It was a bit hidden from the rest of the eateries in the plaza. It is a bit of a drive for me but I will happily be back."}
{"text":"Very slow service at lunch. Restaurant is only half full but no food arrived for 25Min. 
Waitress do not greet customers and no smile.
Wifi connection does not work and waitresses have no idea
No lunch special. So, not good value for lunch compared to restaurants in same plaza"}
{"text":"Came here twice and service was rather slow both times. Perhaps there's not enough hands in the kitchen so they couldn't meet the demands as quickly.

Good customer service and friendly staff. Warm and welcoming feeling of the restaurant. Cute interior and cozy in my opinion.

We ordered the Karaage, which looked nicely fried but was slightly denser than I would've liked it and the batter was a bit soggy. The rice was well cooked and has a good Japanese rice texture. The mayo was really the main thing I tasted but overall dish was just ok.

I also got the milk tea soft serve when they had it and the soft serve was more to the icy side, which I prefer the creamy texture. Slight taste of milk tea but artifical to me so was not my favorite. May come back to try the other dishes and compare."}
{"text":"Awesome meat, but bland udon which is unfortunate considering they only serve udon (thick noodle dishes) and don (over rice). My boyfriend's udon was so bland he actually didn't even finish it. However, the chicken karage that goes on top was juicy with a light and crisp tempura batter. My beef gyu don was good, but fairly basic. I also thought it was odd that they put edamame still in the pod in my bowl. The outside isn't edible and I don't like having to pick out the pea pods. I am faced with the dilemma or fumbling with my chopsticks or getting my hands messy to eat the peas from their pod. My boyfriend was also faced with a similar dilemma because he had a whole piece of corn cob in his dish.

Drinks! Very odd they don't serve leaf tea! No green tea or jasmine tea in bags!?! Whaaaat? You will be forced to order drinks from their specialty list of hot and cold milk teas (made from powder or syrup) or have water. Ironically, you can get matcha milk tea -- although mine was chalky in taste because it had not been stirred and heated enough. It's one saving grace is that if you are patient enough to wait for the marshmallows to melt, your tea will be nicely sweetened.

Some highlights of the meal were the appetizers. We had the battered shrimp with mayo, and cheese corn. Both were awesome! The cheese corn has a pool of a soya based dipping sauce at the bottom which was delicious. I have never had corn dressed up this way and it was great! :) I will totally make this at home one day.

Service was a bit disorganized. When we walked in, two waitresses wanted to assign us to a table on two separate occasions. One said she would clean a table for us to sit at, despite there being four or five available tables of appropriate size for us. Another waitress then asked to seat us and we mentionned we were already being helped so she went to help clean down the table we were to sit at. I don't think the waitresses had discussed who would ACTUALLY be serving our table. Our menus were down and set aside, but despite this, we were passed by several times before I had to stop one of the waitresses to politely ask to order. 

All in all this restaurant is still fairly new, so having a new wait staff is forgiveable. Their appetizers were great! Rice dishes were good and udon (soup) could be better. I also like that they offer some dishes that are different from the typical japanese places I have been before. With some fine tuning, this could be a really good little restaurant. :)"}
{"text":"I'm so very happy that when someone asks if we can go for \"Japanese food\" in Markham, I can now say: \"What kind?\" It's not just all about sushi anymore! 

Moji is a very cute and modern restaurant in Peachtree Centre (which has definitely been bringing in more businesses that cater to the younger generation). It's spacious, bright, and kinda has a kindergarten art class feel. It also specializes in affordable rice and udon bowls along with Japanese snacks. 

Snacks: We ordered the \"must-have\" takoyaki and cheese corn. I've gotta say, seeing my food \"wave\" to me (bonito flakes & seaweed waving in the steam) made me very excited to eat it. And I definitely wasn't let down. The takoyaki had lots of octopus and the corn was roasted perfectly. Even though I really, really, really enjoyed the corn, I have to admit it's too expensive at nearly $4 for one corn (broken in half). 

Bowls: I got the avocado crab meat rice bowl, boyfriend got the karaage (fried chicken) udon bowl. Both were delicious! The karaage was very crispy and covered in delicious sauces. The udon had an odd piece of cantaloupe...which I guess is more for decoration than for eating. 

My rice bowl was very colourful and the crab meat and avocado were perfect compliments. Wish there was some cucumber or something to lighten it up though because the fatty avocado + crabmeat mixed in mayo + rice was a difficult task to finish after the halfway mark. 

This is more our fault than Moji's, but even though we LOVED the food, everything was too heavy at the end because Japanese mayo was everywhere! The snacks had mayo, the karaage had mayo, my crabmeat was mixed in mayo. Japanaese mayo, baby, I love you, but you gotta give me some space! 

I think next time, I'll stick with the beef udon bowls :) 


Note: Not relevant to the restaurant, but some 'cool guy' had aviator shades on the whole time inside the restaurant haha......

{"text":"Someone must have woken up one morning and said New Kennedy Square ????? is a tired & fugly mall, let's put a quirky Jap-fusion restaurant and remind the world we're in the 21st century. 

Well, it worked?!  Yea, it's one of the one places I think of first when I drive into the mall.  However, it's also one of the few places that I have difficulty patronizing.  Why so difficult eh?  I happen to go to MOJI not once but thrice on the day they are closed, whichever day that is...

I've been to MOJI both with friends and as a single diner.  Both times I felt uncomfortable in a out-of-place sort of way, since the decor has a tinge of feminism either that or my hormones wanted more action than cute romance manga.  

HAPPY HOUR set here is not what you think it is, but it's a big reason I'm a repeat customer.  (A) Donburi + (B) App + (C) Tea = $5.99 between hours of 2:30~5:00 pm from Mon-Fri where it's calm and no need to compete for parking. 

To summarize, - Product(3.0) - Price(3.5) - Place(3.0) - People(3.0) - Promotion(3.5).  Now the only question is \"which day are they closed again?\""}
{"text":"No credit card.  Debit or cash only .

Food was average.  Come here for the ambience and to hangout."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch as I've heard a lot of good reviews. I tried both the curry chicken udon and the beef udon. I preferred the curry udon as it was more flavourful. The beef udon-soup based was just a miso soup base. The drinks are quite unique- had the two tone rose drink. Overall 3/5."}
{"text":"The HYPE is real!

Came here with my buddies last Saturday night around 7pm looking for some cheap and delicious Japanese food, and was not disappointed.

Upon entering, this place was packed, and so one of the waitresses temporarily sat us at the high table/bar stool area.  She gave us the menu so that we could order, and we only had to wait a few minutes before a table opened up.  

I must say that the waitresses were very attentive and efficient, even with a full house to serve.  Service was surprisingly good - those 4 waitresses deserve gold stars.

I ordered the Unagi Don ($11.95) which comes with miso soup, and an iced taro milk tea ($2.00 w/ the meal).  The Unagi was nice, soft, and tasty - I quite enjoyed it.  The dish was also garnished with edamame, cantaloupes, and seaweed.  The iced taro milk tea was a bit sweet but I still enjoyed it (don't order it if you left your sweet tooth at home).

The decor was exceptional as well.  Moji is decorated with wooden tables, mismatched chairs, and cutesy colours.  Accompanying the decor is a very kawaii Japanese soundtrack.  Both of these contributed to an atmosphere with 0ppm testosterone.

Moji brings something new to the table in a Markham that's saturated with Chinese restaurants and AYCE's.  It's my new favourite spot for an affordable, tasty meal."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very unique, not a usual theme. They have valentines theme up and probably will switch it up when other holidays and events come along. The food was delicious, a bit too much sauce on top of the food, however, the drink was very good; not too sweet not too watered down. The rice tasted a bit old but the ginger and peas were a great addition."}
{"text":"I came here for dessert only on a weekday night. When you walk in, the style of Moji is very interesting - a mix of wood and plastic chairs and tables with walls of different styles on each wall. There's not exactly one set design, but multiple combined. There are cut napkins on the side, and when you get the bill, they come in metal buckets! Pretty interesting! For your order, you are given a sheet of paper to write the Letter and Number of your order.

Drinks are $2 with a meal, but on it's own, they are $3.80 to $4 each. I came in to try the ice cream. Make sure you ask what the Special is - it looks like Taro, but my friend who came here before said the Special was blueberry. I ordered D4 (twist), which was taro and Matcha ice cream with tapioca and popping pearls located underneath. My friend ordered D1, which was the ice cream float and it came with the marble sodas!

The ice cream itself was average, though I prefer this over a menchies or yogurtys as the price of my order will be double the cost!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this new restaurant for a couple of weeks and finally made it! 
It's a very cute restaurant, like a wooden cafe, bright, clean cut and spacious.  

Purposely came on a weekday because of all the reviews saying how busy and slow the service might be.  When we got there, there were only 5 tables, so it wasn't too busy or loud.  

Drinks are written on a wooden plank which adds a nice unique touch to their wooden theme.  

The menu looked tasty, and I wanted to try many things, however my tummy didn't like that idea. 

We went with the Wasabi mayo takoyaki.  The takoyaki was really good, crispy on the outside, and nice and mushy in the inside with a fair bit of octopus inside.  The Wasabi mayo didn't have much of a flavour, could have went with the regular takoyaki.  They have tempura flakes which adds a nice crisp. 

I got the crab meat and avocado rice, my boyfriend got the gyu beef Don.  The presentation is very nice, with ginger, cantaloupe, edaname, marinated egg.  
I found my rice to be a little dry.  It needed another item to be mixed in, perhaps some cucumber or something to make it less dry.  The mayo wasn't enough for the rice. 

My boyfriends gyu Don was really nice.  Good amount of onion and marinated beef and wasn't dry at all.
The portion was pretty good, enough to feel really full. 

We tried 2 drinks for extra $2.00. I tried the lychee yogurt slush, and my boyfriend got the ginger fruit tea.  His mug was huge, and gave a nice aroma.  The ginger adds a little coolness to the throat when you drink it, so it's nice on a winter day. 

My lychee slush was presented in a mason jar.  Cute presentation! I couldn't finish mine, so got a to go cup, and brought the rest home to slowly sip on :) 

The service was really good, very attentive, and food came quick and hot. 

When given the bill, was given a coupon for free ice cream, expires end of February (they crossed out the January 31 and replaced with February) 

Will definitely come back and try a different bowl. I saw the tempura bowls coming out from the kitchen and they looked really good with lots of veggies and large shrimp!!"}
{"text":"I like it
good lunch specials but usuals can be pretty expensive and the portions aren't the biggest 
the drinks are great and the desserts too 
the drinks are also very unique such as the rose calpis drink which is aesthetically pleasing and the strawberry genmaicha that had yummy strawberry bits 
the happy hour is 2:30-5 and it is $7.95 with an appetizer drink and meal 
for food I would recommend the chicken teriyaki rice, the ramen and avacado crab stick rice (my fav) :) 
for dessert I have tried the matcha ice cream and it has a great matcha flavour 
overall it's cute inside and the service is nice so give it a try"}
{"text":"Found out about this place through a fellow Yelper's review. I have asked the server when they opened and apparently they have only been in operation for a week, so I am glad to leave a review and spread the word about Moji Japanese Cuisine.

Came here on a Saturday at 7PM for dinner and surprised that the place was empty except for 2 other customers. It is a small place, but looks really clean and trendy! 

To start, we got Edamame ($2.95) which is served cold. It was very tasty!!

I ordered the chicken teriyaki donburi for $8.5 that comes with miso soup. My BF got the spicy gyu donburi for $8.75. I was surprised with the items that came in the bowl as well: egg, ginger, some edamame, and apple slices. 

The food came in 5 mins or so after ordering which is very fast! Definitely much faster service than Donburi.

Food is really tasty in this restaurant and I recommend checking it out. I wanted to give a 5-star however we wanted to try their hot drinks but we were informed they were not available, so therefore the minus 1 star.

Service is excellent. Food is served fast and fresh. Price and serving size is pretty standard. Decor is trendy. I would definitely come back to try other dishes from their small menu."}
{"text":"The dishes were thoughtfully put together, but were too overpriced. It simply wasn't anything special, since the quality of food was essentially something served from home. Felt the interior of the restaurant was random. Don't get me wrong, it was cute & all but the ambience just did not match...like Japanese style dishes with cutesy bbt on the side ?!? To summarize, this wouldn't be something I recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place! 
Food is decent, not outstanding, but good enough. I think the Portions are just right, but if you're small eater then it might be a bit big for you.  
Great environment, great place to take pictures
Unagi on rice had a really big piece of unagi, which no japanese eatery has ever had
Great drink & dessert selection as well! 
Creative!"}
{"text":"Replaced the old Nak Won location (which replaced the older Omega fish soup restaurant), this new Moji location may not last long either... 

Came here on a Sat around 1pm, with only a few tables occupied, but ended up waiting more than an hour for our main course! 

Making donburi is so fast and easy to prepare in batches, so there is absolutely no excuse for taking close to 1 hr to make the gyu-don! Even the seaweed salad took 40 mins to serve. Oh, and they ran out of chicken for our karage order...  How do you run out of chicken??? 

At the 30 min mark, I saw one of the employees come in with a bag of groceries from the supermarket next door. If you need to go out and buy groceries to replenish your ingredients mid-day, then clearly you have a fundamental problem running a restaurant. Especially given the restaurant was only 30% full and it was only mid-day, how can you so grossly underestimate the amount of basic ingredients you need to last the entire day? You're not serving sashimi... half your ingredients comes from a jar/can (MSG, miso paste) or is frozen (your beef) so you don't need to buy fresh ingredients daily! 

Overall, the food quality was sub-par. The takoyaki was decent, but the gyu-don wasn't very good. The matcha tea had too much sugar and tasted like powdered hot chocolate, and the matcha soft serve was too icy and couldn't really taste the matcha. 

Donburi restaurant on Hwy7 and Commerce Valley Drive is way better. Nobody is going to wait 1 hr for a basic gyu-don! Either improve your service time or nobody will come back..."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's got the cutest decor inside and the waiters are super nice! Prices are reasonable, and have a good selection of a variety of different don's! Will definitely return for the Parfaits another time :3"}
{"text":"We drove by and the decor in the front and the inside was intriguing so we walked in to give it try.  We actually made it their happy hour 230-500 which offered a great selection of value combos-must try it.  You get a rice, side and drink for a great price.  Great value for good food in Markham!

They changed the menu a bit and added greater choices.  We had the lunch special with soup ($7.99) and a cold drink for half price ($2 instead of $4).
 
Check out my pictures and yes the taste is as good as the pictures!   The lunch came in a bowl that you may think is small but the reality is that you get an entire bento box in a bowl.   Portions are good and taste is great.  I did not need water either after my meal due to MSG!  I loved the egg commonly seen in Ramen in my rice dish.   

No change from my earlier review.   Great value, very nice environment to eat/sit and great food too.  A must try place in Markham!"}
{"text":"3.25 stars. Came here for a late lunch after a frustrating experience of trying to get into a trendy new Thai restaurant in Scarborough. Was surprised at how bright, open, clean, cute and empty the restaurant is. There were only about 15 people in the restaurant but it was nearly 3pm. There is ample seating and I like the simple wooden tables and eclectic mix in of colourful chairs.

There are various options for udon bowls and rice bowls with choice of beef, pork, seafood, and chicken. There are also appetizer options like takoyaki, karaage, and ebi mayo. My hubby ordered the gyu don (thin slices of beef and sautéed onions in a sweet marinade), served with pickled ginger, slices of cantaloupe and a few pieces of edamame over rice. This dish also came with a small bowl of miso soup. 

I ordered the ebi mayo which came with 5 pieces of decently sized fried shrimp and mayo based sauce. For an extra $2 with a meal, you can order a from a selection of hot or cold drinks such as hot chocolate or matcha milk. We ordered the matcha milk which had a decent matcha flavour but wasn't as creamy as say Starbucks matcha latte. 

For dessert we ordered the twist with matcha and taro soft serve. The taro flavour was more prominent in the twist than the matcha, or perhaps my palate was desensitized to the matcha flavour by the matcha milk I had been drinking.

A solid food experience and decent service for a reasonable price. Will be back to try their other offerings.

{"text":"People hate on this place and I'm really not sure why. Food quality is what you expect out of a $12 lunch (which can come with any drink you want... and drinks could be $6, so it's a pretty sweet deal). 

Their menu is generally donburi (rice) bowls with a variety of different meats and sauces to go along with it. There are different times you could come for even better deals, like happy hour, where you can get a drink for just $2 if you order another bowl. 

I forget what I ate now, but I'm pretty sure it had chicken in it. The portions aren't very big... Content-wise, they're just slightly bigger than a traditional Chinese rice bowl, which if you think about it, is not too filling. However, the drink was huge, so that made up for that gaping void in my stomach. 

Personally, I think the taste was good. Only the portion size was a little dismal, but good thing the drinks were yum. I think their drinks were really flavourful and great for the summer! 

I recommend coming here for a quick bite if you aren't famished, or if you wanted a pretty drink that looks good in pictures and tastes good too. This is a Japanese-style eatery."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour from 2 to 5.  Decided to try this for a change instead of going to HK diner.  $5.99 for bowl of rice, appetizer and drink seemed like a pretty good deal.  Had spicy beef rice, seaweed salad and iced peach drink.  Food was ready in 5 minutes.  Overall, good afternoon snack.  Rice was small bowl but adequate.  Wish food was hotter.  The cold drink was pretty refreshing. 
Not sure if i would come back for dinner since $10 for a bowl of beef teriyaki rice is pricey.  Would probably eat somewhere else in peachtree plaza.
But love the homey feel and ambience of this place.  Fun to chill with friends."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Hipster place with some nice plating for your instagram photos. Food is sub-par, but ice cream is good. I recommend the green tea ice cream with oreo bits. Their price to quality/portion is quite expensive, but you shouldn't be expected to wait too long for a seat -- it's quite big inside.

1. Food (3 - 3.5/5)

When I came here, I had their soup noodles combo. It's nothing too special and I would say it's a bit overpriced for the quality and portion. Their ice cream, however, was quite good and would be the reason that the score is brought up. I personally tried their green tea ice cream; it was smooth and you can really taste the green tea! If you're planning to come here, I would recommend that you eat something else at the plaza, and come here for their dessert only!

------------

Overall (3 - 3.5/5)"}
{"text":"I forgot to take some pictures because I completely put all my attention to the food when they were brought to us  presentation of the food aside (which is great), everything is fresh and made to order. My son loves coming over here for lunch. The price is very reasonable and the portion is just right.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Place was nice. Very family and friend oriented. Presentation of everything was great and pleasing! 

The warm water was served in a glass jar with small cute Japanese cups. 

Each dish was just the perfect serving size. The right about of meat, veggie and udon. Love how they have a udon promotion where u can get a free calpis beverage with a purchase of a udon. 

We got 3 beverages peach, mango and lychee. Lychee was the best out of the free.

The soft serve changes ever now and then so I haven't had the same flavour yet."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! No lie, no exaggeration.. this MAY be my new favourite eatery in the GTA! Hell, am I ever impressed! I walked in to see what new place replaced the old and dingy nakwon and was happy to see a brightly lit, hispterish, open restaurant that resembles the cuteness you can often find in cafes at yonge and finch. 

We got a seat right away, and I couldn't help but keep admiring the restaurant- it was super kawaii. I was surprised to see how extensive the menu was and how many things I wanted to eat.. geez, the food was such a good deal & it all looked so yummy! They had so many appies, such as takoyaki, chicken karaage + more stuff. Additionally, they had a bunch of drink and desserts on their menu and they were all droolworthy. I got a huge matcha latte for $2.. which was amazing- the matcha was strong with the right amount of bitterness. It tasted better than the starbucks bullshit that they sell for $6.. it even came with marshmallows.. yum! I ordered the curry chicken udon, which was delightful. Udon was extremely chewy while soft, and the curry was a good consistency- not too thick nor too watery.. it was great. NOW. THE BEST THING THEY OFFER- the freaking takoyaki is a damn diamond in this place. It's definitely the best takoyaki I've ever had in my LIFE. And if you know me, you know I'm all about them octopus balls. The takoyaki consistency was crispy on the outside and super doughy and flavourful inside.. droool for DAAAYS. 

This place has SO much to offer, and I think it's great addition to the ever so busy peachtree centre. Definitely want to come back and try more matcha goodies!"}
{"text":"Had a really enjoyable experience here at Moji and would definitely return!

I actually really like the menu, there's not too much but in this case a simple menu is better. Essentially there's only donburi/udon bowls to choose from but there's still a great amount of variety between them. There's also some great dessert items too, I could see myself coming here just for those as well. 

I ordered the unagi don with a side order of takoyaki. The dish has a lot going on with it and I love all the elements of it. However we felt the rice was a tad too soft and could have been sweeter. The takoyaki was hot, fresh, and delicious. I highly recommend getting an order and sharing. Just note the cheese one simply has grated cheese and the wasabi one just wasabi mayo instead of the normal.

The decor and ambience of the place is inviting and cozy, and I enjoyed it very much. It's an open concept and I like the 'wooden' look! Service was decent, although I felt we could have been asked how we were doing."}
{"text":"A cute place in an less than desirable plaza in Markham. The place feels open, and the decor is quite nice. For a table of 2 around 6.30pm on a Friday night, there was no wait however, around 7-7.30pm a line started to form. Service was usual nothing spectacular, but wasnt bad either, the food came in a timely matter which was good.

I got the tempura udon noodles in hot broth. It came with 3 shrimp and some calamari. The noodles it self had some enoki mushrooms, edamame, tofu, a small corn and very oddly a slice of cantaloupe (which really threw me off guard). It came with enough \"stuff\" to keep it interesting and not just noodles, which I liked. The broth itself was not that special but the noodles were nice and chewy. But it felt really run-of-the-mill and didn't really blow me away. It all came on a cute little tray with chili powder. They also had a bunch of drinks you could add to your meal. My friend got a warm taro drink and it came with a few mini marshmallows and wasn't overly sweet.

We also got the matcha sundae which came up red bean paste, pocky, a stick of kit kat and a lightly torched marshmallow. It was definitely looked fun and was a great dessert to share! 

Overall I'd return for a casual meal in Markham if I am really craving udon noodles."}
{"text":"The first thing I felt at this restaurant was the hipster, relaxing vibe it gives. The fact that the restaurant doesn't try to overcrowd it's tables and seats expands the atmosphere and makes you feel like you can enjoy your time there. 

The service was pleasant as the servers were prompt to respond and delivery of food was quick.

We ordered a spicy beef gyu don and a pork mayo don. I personally enjoyed the beef don better, but that's not to say the pork don was bad! We also ordered a matcha green tea and a lychee yogurt drink for $2 each. Both drinks were refreshing and delicious. I would recommend the matcha green tea to someone who prefers to have a milder flavour and the lychee yogurt to those that want a stronger, sweeter flavour.

After the meal we were treated to a free matcha green tea ice cream (picked between that and taro) and the flavour was very consistent and texture was soft (unlike some places where ice cream is very icy).

Overall, would visit here again!!"}
{"text":"A new japanese style donburi/udon place in Markham is always a welcoming addition.  Came here on a Wednesday night after seeing a few reviews for this place.

First impression as I walked in was, this place looks like those fast food places you see in Hong Kong in the 90s, but once you actually observe the setting carefully, you can see the owner decided to go with this design on purpose.  Everything seems VERY out of place but very hipster.

Food wise, my friend and I ordered the Gyu Don (Beef rice), Curry chicken udon and Wasamayo Takoyaki.  I was very impressed with the takoyaki and udon.  Takoyaki was done to perfection, very crispy on the outside and flavourful on the inside, although the wasabi mayo wasn't strong enough.

Udon was very good, although i would prefer other flavours than the curry because it just tasted like those Japanese curry cube you get in supermarket.  The udon itself was VERY chewy which i LOVE.  The rice on the other hand, if there was more sauce it would be better.

I also ordered the Matcha milk tea and it was pretty good.  Very strong matcha flavour and i like how they added marshmallows on the top!  I will come back for sure to try other udons offered at this place."}
{"text":"Live nearby and been wanting to come try it out since it opened. I gotta say, it was surprisingly authentic and tasty to boot. Tried the mayo pork don and the chicken karage udon. Both were satisfyingly tasty.  Got takoyakis on the side and that was also yummy. The mango yogurt drink was refreshing but not bland. The matcha green milk tea (hot) tasted of real green tea and not overly sweet that you'd find at all the bbtea shops within 10kms.   Everything was great. If I had to complain, I'd say the pricing and serving sizes are a little on the extreme for the mall but take the shop, plop it in j-town without changing a thing and most wouldn't bat an eye at the pricing and serving sizes. 

I *will* go back if that's worth anything."}
{"text":"Quality has definitely gone downhill with increased prices. This used to be one of my favourite Japanese places for rice bowls. That's no longer anymore. There was barely any curry and veggies in the curry bowl. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Simple place with simple decor. Nothing fancy but the food is enjoyable at fair prices. Another place which only accepts cash or debit - which is my only beef because a lot of us are so used to paying with our cellulars or credit cards."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try and my
second time here was definitely better than the first. And I gotta owe it all to the dude that worked there that day. Like damn boi. He was so welcoming and nice. There didn't seem to be an ounce of rudeness in him. Unfortunately, didn't catch his name BUT YOU ROCK DUDEE YOU ROCK!!!! 

I went here during the happy hour thing, and it seems like the menu has slightly changed. This time I got the:

1. Avocado Crabmeat Rice
- which was pretty good
- I absolutely love avocado with rice so this was an instant like for me

2. Sea Salt Edamame
- hated this
- i thought it was just salt sprinkled on to the edamame, but there was also like some kind of sauce and sesame seeds on it and yeah, doesn't taste good altogether 
- i personally think they should've kept it simple by just adding salt to the edamame 

3. Iced Rose Calpis
- was smart this time and got this
- pretty good
- not too sweet; slight rose taste 
- rose is not too overpowering which is nice 

Well yeah that's it. Honestly I don't know why they took away certain items (like the takoyaki balls) and replaced it with mediocre ones, but oh well. But anyways, I actually only wanted to update my review because of the dude that worked there so MATE ANOTHER \"YOU ROCK\" TO YOU!!! NICE WAY TO END OFF THE YEAR EH AND GIRLS WORKING THERE YOU BETTER STEP UP YO GAME"}
{"text":"Cute place! Everything is made out of wood, like even their menu. Very cute hangout spot for friends. They have a range of food from dessert to bubble tea and other rice dishes! Their matcha dessert with Mochi is super good, although small in serving size."}
{"text":"Came here for their $5.99 happy hour special. I got teriyaki chicken rice, edamame, and an iced peach green tea. I really enjoyed my meal and thought they gave good portion sizes. I was really full after my meal. 

The inside of the restaurant was nicely decorated. All the tables were wood and there were mismatched chairs at all the tables which I thought was a nice touch. The tables also comes with its own holder full of utensils that you help yourself to. 

There is not much interaction with the employees at this place. They just seat you at your table and then give you paper and a twistable crayon (not sure why they don't give pens. Crayons are harder to write with) to write your own order on. 

Given it's cheap happy hour special, I'll be back here next time for sure!"}
{"text":"I didn't feel the excitement here. The atmosphere is very cute and brings a feeling of comfort and warmth with the wooden furniture and plants. The menu is very limited in what you can get, but I noticed the special deal where you can get any drink for $2 with any meal between 12pm (?) - 5pm. 

The food itself is kind of... fast-food like. I ordered the curry rice and my friend ordered the tonkatsu ramen (which is not worth $12). Yes, the food came within 5 minutes of ordering which makes me suspect that maybe it was just packaged powdered curry (it tasted like the japanese instant curry you can buy at T&T). For $8.50, I don't think it was worth it. The quality of the food wasn't that amazing. My friend, who ordered the ramen, definitely wasted $12.50 on it - the bowl was half full, the serving size was small and it tasted pretty much like package ramen.

Pretty disappointed here, though service was quick and staff were friendly. Just the food wasn't amazing as the reviews suggested imo."}
{"text":"Staff are not trained, The wood thing for utensils aren't polished..... Overall the food is good. And they don't have the specialty drinks which i went there for that.."}
{"text":"I came for afternoon tea a while back and although the restaurant wasn't that full, unfortunately after we placed our order, the staff had forgotten to enter our orders into the system. They offered to give us a complimentary appetizer and soft serve (as pictured) which was very kind and thoughtful of them. The decor of the restaurant is super cute and quaint and changes with the seasons. However, the food was a little underwhelming, it was lukewarm and nothing to rave about - very mediocre. The presentation was different, with marshmallows for your matcha latter and a fancy soft serve, but otherwise, it wasn't that special. Food was mediocre, prices were quite steep, and decor and servers were both fantastic!"}
{"text":"How do I give 3.5 stars?  I guess I can't so I'll just round up.  

Moji is not a bad place to hang out.  It's got decent food, not freaking amazing, but not terrible.  Their service is decent, their prices are quite good for the portion sizes you get. 

Highlights:
- Unagi - for $11.99 I get a bowl of Unagi rice with the a very decent sized piece of eel.  There was more eel then rice.   I am impressed since most restaurants tend to skimp.   

- Rose Calpis (Calpis is a Japanese soft drink even though it sounds so similar to something not drinkable but coming from a cow.)   Rose Calpis drink was pretty....nice gradient pink, with little rose petals, and was also quite refreshing.  I wasn't expecting it to be good and it was!  

-Happy hour specials - you get a small bowl of entree, an appetizer and a drink for $5.99.   That's very well priced.   Most people get the cheese takoyaki (keep in mind there's no cheese in the takoyaki, it's on top).   

- Their shrimp tempura was decent, I mean not anything super special, but done right, crispy and hot.  

- The lobster and tobiko with sheets of seaweed is a really tasty appetizer.   

The interior is very pintrest and Instagram happy.   :-)  

Lowlights:  
- Their ice creams are super pretty for photos but taste okay.   I mean, it depends on your taste buds, if you like taro bubble tea (the purple stuff that comes in powder form), you will LOVE their taro soft serve.   

- I can't speak for Durian ice-cream because I've only tried it once, their durian puree was quite an experience, and I'm still not sure how I feel.  Though durian fans will likely enjoy it."}
{"text":"Came for the happy hour menu (2:30-5:00pm) but was disappointed for find that it is now $7.99. 

I forgot to take a picture of the new menu but the items generally are the same as before. I got the Avocado Crabmeat Rice, Seaweed Salad and Iced Japanese Genmaicha (no longer includes tapioca or jelly, extra $1) and my friend got the Spicy Gyu Rice, Corn Egg Salad and Iced Strawberry Green Tea. We were both disappointed with our meals. The appetizers were both good but considering how basic they are it should be expected. The main courses were subpar. My main consisted of a large bowl of rice topped with a bit of mayo, strands of crabmeat, 1/5 an avocado, and half an egg. The amount of rice given did not add up to the toppings and I ended up eating just plain rice mixed with mayo two bites in. My friend's Gyu was likewise a large bowl of rice with three or four pieces of hotpot sliced beef and some hot sauce on top. The drinks were okay but extremely sweet. I can see paying $5.99 for a quick snack but at $7.99 there are so many more options for a better meal. 

To me, Moji is about the frills rather than food, which is understandable considering the cutesy set up (great for instas)."}
{"text":"Usually when you think of japanese restaurants you would assume that entails sushi or ramen. While this place does offer ramen, it also has a different take on japanese food by offering many different rice bowl dishes (donburis). 

I ordered the crispy gyu mayo rice with a mango lemonade (?) to drink. The rice bowl overall was very delicious; the beef had a nice flavour and the mayo and rice tasted amazing together. The mango lemonade tasted a lot like the mango hi-chew candy and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was served in a pretty big cup.

The food was delicious but I think this restaurant could definitely improve in some areas. The menu was very confusing for my friend and I to understand. We aren't very familiar with japanese food and the menu mostly had romanized english translations (i.e. gyu don rather than beef rice bowl) which made it difficult for us to order. We ended up spending a lot of time googling the menu items and going through the yelp page.

The menu itself was also kind of hard to understand, some pages were full of text with no pictures - other pages had plenty of pictures but they were blurry?? I think they recently updated their menu and had to reprint everything but their old menus looked a lot nicer and easier to understand (based on the pictures posted by other yelp users)

Thankfully the staff members helped us to decipher the menu and understand what we were ordering."}
{"text":"Super cute little eatery. Its mismatched furniture and lovely light fixtures makes the place seem very welcoming and visually appealing.

Food-wise, they have a very small menu of what looks to be their take on Asian fast food.

I got the Gyu (beef) Udon, which was what the waitress said was their most popular, and my friend got the Kaarage udon, which was the waitress's favourite. We also got $2 drinks with our noodles: Taro milk tea and the passionfruit yogurt drink.

There was a lot of meat in the beef udon, but it was a bit too sweet for my taste. It resembled bulgogi but with very, very thin slices of beef. It also came with half a soft-boiled egg, edamame, enoki mushrooms, slices of tofu, and fruit all in the same bowl. It was okay. It wasn't a huge portion, but I was satisfied after eating everything.

I think they battered the kaarage with tempura batter, which made the fried chicken seem pretty light compared to other ones I've tried. Although it didn't seem like the chicken itself was heavily seasoned, it was pretty good with the mayo that was drizzled on top. 

What really stands out here is really their cute decor, and their taro and green tea soft serve ($3). My friend really enjoyed the twist with both the flavours. 

It seems like it would be a great place to just chill and chat with your friends. I would come back for the atmosphere, dessert, and maybe their smaller snack dishes."}
{"text":"4.5/5. +0.5 for good choice of music . Decent Food, super cute interior, good service."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with a friend during their happy hour. For $5.99, you can't go wrong! I got the avocado crabmeat rice with seaweed salad and rose calpis drink. I was still hungry after so I tried their ice cream. For $4.80 I thought it was pretty good considering it was pretty big and came with so many topping! I got the strawberry and milk tea swirl (milk tea way a lot better imo) with oreo pieces, oreo crumble, pocky sticks, waffle pieces, marshmallow, gummy candy (a bit hard/chewy), corn flake, chocolate syrup, whipped cream, and rose flower pieces. 

I think the only downside is if someone was a big eater, I don't think the happy hour meal would be enough considering I'm a somewhat small eater but still hungry after. 

The ambience is quite nice. There's pretty and cute decors all around, definitely an Instagram-worthy place. 

Service was ok. Nothing extraordinary but wasn't bad."}
{"text":"One of the cutest places in Markham. The decor and mismatched chairs creates a casual atmosphere. Their unagi don rice bowl is delicious and very filling. I also enjoyed their house made lemonade."}
{"text":"Whaaat :( My second visit here and I felt Moji went downhill! 
Service was great but unfortunately, the food quality wasn't.

ICED MARSHMELLOW CHOCOLATE (1/5)
This was pretty bad; there was a huge chunk of whipped cream that covered most of my chocolate drink. It was also too sweet, I can only taste sugary-water and no chocolate flavour. The positive part is that it looks really cute for pictures haha..

CURRY CHICKEN DON (rice) (2/5)
This dish came in room-temperature D: The chicken bits were marinated separately from the curry sauce so there were 3 different choppy flavours to this rice bowl: curry sauce with veggies without curry flavours, chicken strips, rice. Will not order this again.

I hope they improve their quality of food soon! 
The first visit I had was great, don't know what happened now :("}
{"text":"A fun and cute restaurant.  I love the decor and it's so kid friendly.  Service is great and food is great.  I find the prices is little bit steep..maybe by $1 or so.  It does add up if you have a family of 4.  None the less the kids are happy and they indulged in the food and already wanting to come back the next day."}
{"text":"Cosy petit shop with a quirky mismatch of decors. 
Wooden table tops with a mismatch of chairs. Each table had a little small potted plant to add some greenery to the place. 

Order:
Iced Peach Calpis Drink
Iced Green Tea Lychee Drink
Unagi with Rice
Mayo Pork with Rice

Drinks came in a cute mason jar with a straw. At first I thought my drink was a bit watered down..but it turns out I didn't mix it well, all the sweetness was at the bottom. It was quiet refreshing but I hardly tasted the peach. Green Tea Lychee Drink was also ok.

Deeped fried Tofu was ok.., but it was a bit bland, so it needed to soak itself in the soy sauce a bit longer to sponge all the flavours in. 

Cheese Takoyaki were pretty good. It was basically a basic Takoyaki topped with mayo and cheese. It was moist inside and had at least 2 pieces of tako inside.

My Ungai with Rice was quite good. It also had pickled ginger, egg, edamame beans, & slices of cantaloupe. It wasn't a really large bowl, but it was quite sufficient for me, it hit the spot.

Mayo Pork with Rice was not bad either. The meat was cooked just right, it was moist & flavourful."}
{"text":"Great new don / udon restaurant in Markham.
The decor and design of the place is pleasant. It gives a more modern and clean look than the surrounding Chinese restaurants.

This place is great to fill the cravings of udon or don for all us uptowners but it's nothing special but they do a decent job at around $11 a bowl

I'm not a fan of udon but I tried some and I really like the texture of their's! My girlfriend is a udon snob and she doesn't think much of their noodle. So if you like authentic udon then maybe this place won't satisfy your needs. 

Their rice (don) is good! Nicely flavoured and makes a great base for their bowls. I had their chicken teriyaki and unagi. Both great bowls with good flavour!

We had their green milk tea and taro milk tea. Too sugary in our opinion. The taro was very taroy though! Great job on that but we wouldn't get the green milk tea again. 

To conclude:
For a quick fixen of udon or don at $11 I would come back here for sure! (Maybe without my girlfriend!)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night (January 4, 2017) at around 5:45pm.  There were only 3 tables with customers, so it was nice that my friend and I could pick and choose where we wanted to sit.  It was my first time going to Moji and my friend's second time, so we were still going through the menu (apparently some things had changed since my friend's previous visit).

We ordered:
- karaage
- spicy toroniku ramen
- crispy gyu mayo rice
- 2 x black tea oreo ice cream

The food came relatively quickly since we ordered before the dinner rush.  The karaage was pretty good and my friend said her crispy gyu rice was pretty tasty.  The spicy toroniku ramen came with a dish for the egg, a separate spice shaker and a generous dollop of what I assumed to be chili paste.  I didn't add additional heat with the spice shaker since the chili paste was more than enough.  The ramen came with some fatty pork cheek which was pretty delicious.

Dessert took a while to order because by 7:00pm, the restaurant was full of people.  There only appeared to be two people working so it took some time to get their attention.

The black tea oreo ice cream was delicious!  I've never had black tea ice cream before and the way the desserts were presented more or less made me take a photo of it. :)

All in all, I'm interested in coming back since it appears they have some Happy Hour specials that I'd like to try."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The decor is super cute and the interior somehow manages to feel both spacious and cozy at the same time. The food is delicious and their menu is simple and well organized: appetizers, dons, udons, and (my favourite) sweets. Also, it's a small thing but I liked that they organized the rices and noodles by type of protein, as it made it very easy for me to decide what I wanted.

I ordered the curry prawn tempura udon and my boyfriend got the spicy buta mayo don. They certainly weren't stingy with the shrimp tempura and I really enjoyed both the curry and udon noodles; my boyfriend said that he would have preferred it to be more saucy but I thought that the amount of sauce was perfect, with just enough curry to cover the noodles. He was happy with his pork don as well, but apparently it wasn't very spicy. 

I'm usually hesitant to order taro milk tea because most places make it too powdery and overly sweet, however I was pleasantly surprised to find that the taro milk tea here is neither; it tasted a little watered down at first but I quickly grew to appreciate the subtle taro flavour. For dessert, we shared a twist (matcha & taro) ice cream. Both the matcha and taro soft serves were deliciously creamy without losing the authenticity of their flavour. 

Honestly, I think the sweets section of the menu alone was enough to win me over. Fun soft serve flavours and mochi? Yes please. I would definitely like to come back to try some of the other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"It was hard giving Moji a less than 5 star review. Mojo had been in my bookmarks for a while and I was looking forward to my visit. I loved the decor and vibe of the restaurant but the food really wasn't 5 stars for me. Food taste is the most important criteria for me and I found the food to be very heavy and salty. The service was great and I found the afternoon menu set enticing mainly because of the economical price. I would definitely go back for another try!"}
{"text":"Waiting time 0/5  , super slow , waited for almost an hour for our food. To begin with , I have been here a few times and 2 out of 3 times it has been incredibly slow , the one time it was fast or moderately timed was when there was 10 people in the eatery . Food is good ,Priced decently . Waitresses are usually just doing nothing , which is probably the main issue here . I would only recommend this if there are less then 10 customers eating here .
EDIT : i believe a new owner took over and has really improved their service, food is hotter and comes out quicker ; prices are still modestly priced"}
{"text":"Overpriced food and minimal service.

The place looks nice and spacious with different decor. 

The food however was underwhelming to say the least. 
We ordered one beef don and one shrimp tempura curry rice. Both comes with a miso soup on the side.
My beef don looked so sad..... Little beef, too sweet..... I'm better off saving up the ten dollar for a plane ticket back to Hk to enjoy a bowl of yoshinoya.
The shrimp tempura..... Nothing wow-Ed me..
On the side we also ordered a wasabi mayo octopus takoyaki
While the sauce tasted not bad..... There's only nano size octopus in the balls.....so......yeah...... Not coming back"}
{"text":"Finally came in for dinner. There are a few things I have to comment on. 
1. The food is good. Not fantastic but pretty good. We had the gyu don, unagi don and chicken karaage and they were good. The prices are lower then average for this type of food, so that's a plus! 

2. The seating is set up so that they can accommodate shared tables but I'm not sure it's the most efficient way for the wait staff to get around. 

3. There are not enough wait staff for the number of patrons they can seat. So the service is sub-par. I think if they changed the layout and hired another person for cash/counter service it could be running like a well oiled machine."}
{"text":"Lmao when I walked in i felt so out of place. Honestly the only thing that saved me were my thick rimmed glasses and undercut. To describe the atmosphere of the place would be as if all the hipsters in Markham turned into a restaurant...and I love it. 

Honestly this place is blessed. The takoyaki was on point. Some of the best I have had. Honestly it was good enough to give me a Foodgasm. The rice bowls weren't bad either with generous portions of meet. However the rice could have had a bit of seasoning...but that's personal taste. 

To finish off ur meal I would recommend a matcha milk tea. The lactose Intolerance said no...but the tastes buds say yes. Honestly worth the cramps and brick shits.

The only thing that killed me was the Mochi and ice cream. The soft served ice cream while tasty was not worth the shits after. If there was more Mochi maybe it would have been. But 6 small pieces of plain Mochi didn't really float my boat.

Anyway would come again...( how do people end reviews)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and got the seafood tempura udon & the spicy beef udon and was really unhappy with the food. The broth was flavourless even with the tons of spicy seasoning I added. It was definitely not what we expected from a place with such high ratings. Needless to say, you could probably cook better udon at home and save the money. The tempura that came with it was good though (that's why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of the 1). Also, they lack sufficient take-out boxes - so you better finish your meal or you might have to fit it all in a coffee cup."}
{"text":"Moji is like the hip younger brother among a plaza of Chinese restaurants, bakeries and grocery stores. All I want is mo' Moji. 

First and most importantly, +9000 points for Tony the waiter. He genuinely has a good time with customers and is hilarious. You'll know for sure it's him when you see him grinning and making small talk with your table. Not at all what you'd expect in this plaza, thanks for the all star service!

I tried the avocado crabmeat don (it's a giant California roll in \"bowl\" form). Fake crab meat, avocado, fish roe and strips of seaweed on a bed of warm rice. In your bowl, you're also find a few slices of cantaloupe (??), a soft-boiled egg (which was cold :S), edamame and ginger.  The Japanese mayo drizzled on top is v v good. I would add that secret sauce to eveeeerything.

The soft serve flavours of the month are black tea & matcha. Instead of getting them swirled, I'd recommend that you ask for small scoops of each; they were both bitter in different ways and didn't taste good together at all. They squirt a single dollop of whipped cream off-centre (reminded me of a bow in your hair) and stick in a single chocolate pocky. It's all very cute, much like the entire look and feel of this resto."}
{"text":"I got their lunch special which I  think was very good for its price! It was $8 for a main, an appetizer , and a drink. I got the avocado crabmeat rice which is one of my favourite things on their menu. I also got the peach Calpis drink which was very refreshing. This restaurant is very cute, and has a nice style."}
{"text":"A clean and refreshing place in Markham. The restaurant mimics one of those modern Japanese/Korean cafes you see in dramas. The owner is Chinese. Food wise it isn't the greatest but the price is just right. The portions are smaller than a regular Japanese restaurant but I find Markham portions too big anyways. I really enjoyed their matcha/taro ice cream. I will definitely come back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Cute place with great food! Try their soft serve ice cream for dessert, they change it up every so often with unique flavours that are to die for"}
{"text":"Visited recently with two friends for a long overdue catch up session. The restaurant faces Kennedy, but hidden from view if you're inside the plaza. Parking is a pain in the neck as there is only one row of parking directly in front of Moji. The seating is well spaced and simplistic and adds to the charm of the dainty restaurant. 

I ordered the Spicy Mayo Buta Don and was pleasantly surprised with the complementary miso soup, which was steaming hot and not overly salty. The Japanese rice was well portioned but those with a bigger appetite may still find themselves not completely satisfied (more room for dessert?). The pork was well seasoned and tender, and I enjoyed the spicy mayo which added just a tiny bit of kick. The takoyaki took a little longer to arrive but was freshly made and had sizable chunks of octopus.

We also ordered drinks (peach calpis tea) and the soft serve green tea ice cream. The cold beverage was unremarkable but we thoroughly enjoyed the ice cream. The green tea flavor was strong and at $3, inexpensive.

Overall, the meal was tasty, the service quick and efficient, but the price is just a little high for the location. I do recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"The setup of the shop was extremely cute and it reminded me of something I'd see out of a IKEA' catalog. Their service was okay and dessert was okay as well. I had ordered a rose tea and Oreo ice cream. The rose smelled amazing and the ice cream was rather interesting as it was a combination of matcha and mango. All and all it was pretty good, but not through the roof spectacular. Would definitely come back again to try their savoury snacks."}
{"text":"Moji is one of my new fav places to eat at. The chicken kaarage dishes were so tasty, with that nice crunch on the outside and the soft chicken on the inside. I loved how they gave us the 5 spice shaker. I put that spice on EVERYTHING! The $2 drink add on is a great deal! And the matcha/mango soft serve was divine.

Service was quick and fast. They take cards when everyone else around them doesnt. Great japanese resto. 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Curry veggie rice was not bad. Curry was good. Fried veggies not oily. Meal was decent and didn't feel heavy. Durian dessert was good."}
{"text":"Very cute place. However they are closed on Tuesday :(.

The restaurants serves more ramen/rice bowls. I personally prefer their ramen over rice. 

The overall decoration of the store is modern and wood like. 

Lots of tables and room :)"}
{"text":"Before I came here, I scrambled around the section of the yummy pictures then debated if I should come in or not and finally I came with my class mate after our final exam(in which I didn't do so well lol) so I decided to stuff myself because who doesn't get happy when see yummy food? I know I'm such piggy lol... anyways the reason I gave this location a 3 stars are as followed: 1 star for nice decor and friendly staff, 2nd star is for variety of food offered and I had yet to find out their dessert menu.... and 3rd star goes the mood and setting of the place(ambiance) as the place seems to be trendy and all age are welcome as I saw there was baby, young adults n some more mature client... what they missed is that this place's food are lacking sauce.... for example the Karaage rice was really dry on the rice as there's no sauce for it. The udon or ramen it's quite bland so not enough flavour.... Their appetizer aren't bad, I enjoyed the cheese takoyaki. Another miss is that they did not offer credit card service as this impact on me a lot as I normally don't carry cash. I understand credit card take more charges to their store to use the transaction than a debit card but hey, allowing credit card might just increase ur targeted audience. Just saying lol...Overall, I will still go back to this location since I haven't try their dessert yet...  however I wouldn't order anything with rice or udon or ramen, I would prefer to order a bunch of snacks( but they aren't cheap either).

UPDATE- May/08/2017-came for lunch special(2:30pm-5pm). Server do not greet and kind of rude, so far customer service seems like it isn't their main focus :s

Lunch menu review: ordered spicy gyu rice with seaweed salad and iced rose calpis, I actually like their lunch menu more because the rice n beef have more sauce, portion wise it is smaller but then again, ur also paying for special price! I def recommend it as a choice for lunch :)) the drink was really yummy!"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this unique Japanese restaurant, however, their business hours never matched my schedule. Fortunately for me, i had some extra time yesterday and made it to the restaurant!

First thought when you walk in is that it's a cute little cafe with amazing light fixtures and some unique wall decor. 

Service was quick and friendly. Their menus are small and easy to read. Prices are average. However, the portions for the rice combos are huge!!

We got the unagi rice (12.95), unagi rice with cheese (13.95) and gyu beef curry rice (11.95). We started off with their Ahi Tuna Appetizer (7.95) and takoyaki balls (5.95 for 6). 

Overall the foor was delicious. Large portions, fresh, and even the unagi was considered a larger portion than usual. 

Was too full to go for dessert. But i will definitely be back for that! 

3.5/5"}
{"text":"I came for a Friday lunch with coworkers.  I absolutely agree with all the praises on the interior decoration.  My food experience was not as rosy as other reviewers'.  

We ordered 2 rice bowls and 1 udon entree.  They all looked beautiful.  There were more varieties of toppings than other Japanese rice and noodle restaurants of the same price range.  I had a rice bowl, and the portion was alright for the price ($8.50).  I suspect it might be insufficient for a man of average appetite.  The toppings were nicely done.  The rice was not.  I didn't like the flavour of the mayo sauce, so it negatively impacted my opinion of the rice a lot. 

There were two other off things.  There was no heat in the restaurant.  The outside temperature was under 10C.  It was cool in the restaurant.  Secondly, the waitress never refilled our water cups.  She didn't once ask if things were okay (they weren't as we wanted more water)."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for dinner on a Saturday night. When I first arrived, I was really pleased with the ambience and decor. The mismatched chairs and Pinterest-inspired decor was super cute! The menu comprised of meat and seafood bowls served with rice or udon, appetizers, desserts (Instagram worthy) and specialty drinks. Everything from a first impression perspective was good. However, it quickly went down hill when the server came by to pick up our order sheet without saying a word. I thought that was odd, so I made a comment to my friend who had arrived before me and she mentioned not being greeted when the server initially seated her and brought water to the table. 

We ordered a takoyaki to share with two specialty teas. They were all good but nothing to cry home about. When the rice bowls came, again, the server dropped off the dishes with little care, as if it was an inconvenience to her. Not a word was said again. The rice bowls were average, with too much rice and in my case, not enough curry. We waited a while after our meals were done to realize we had to go up to pay. Perhaps if any of the servers bothered to talk to us, we would've known the payment procedure. That's okay though, my friend and I had lots to catch up on but by the end my throat was dry from talking and I realized our waters were never refilled for the 2 hours we were there!!! I'll note that while the restaurant became busier throughout the evening, I do not think it was overwhelming enough to excuse the lack of service we received. 

I'll also second another review in that the wifi did not work either when I tried. When I asked about it the lady at the cash register just said \"I don't know\".

Overall, this place is cute with decent food at average prices. Ambience wise it's a nice place to catch up with friends with its cute and cozy decor, but I wouldn't return or recommend due to its crappy service. A shame!"}
{"text":"It's a cute place. Decor kind of hip and eclectic, but it's cute more than anything else. Food is decent. I had the ramen, which is passable at best (in other words, skip it unless you absolutely must have ramen for some reason). Rice bowls were pretty good according to my companions, so opt for those instead. Serving sizes are generous and prices affordable. Service is friendly. I was surprised to see that the place wasn't packed on a Saturday night. Bottom line: would I come back here? Well, it's certainly not a place that I would crave or seek out on my own volition again, but if I was in the area and looking for decent Japanese food, I wouldn't mind it."}
{"text":"Was hoping to grab a quick 45min(max) lunch on Sunday which turned out to be like 1.5hr!!  The place was so busy when we got there, the waitress sat us at the bar area near where the kitchen is.  

We ordered the cheese takoyaki, gyu donbouri and curry prawn tempura donbouri.  they were all mediocre at most.  The cheese takoyaki tasted like the frozen ones you buy from the Japanese grocery store.  The beef in the donbouri was on the drier side, i had trouble chewing them.  The curry prawn donbouri was alright, it would be better if they put more curry sauce to the rice.  

We also ordered a taro milk tea and hot chocolate and marshmallow.  The hot chocolate had no taste to it, i felt like i was drinking warm water (literally).  they could perhaps put a little more chocolate powder to it.  The taro milk tea was good, it was not too sweet and it was soothing to drink. 

Service - OMG ! because we sat close to the kitchen, we witnessed how slow the service was.  All the dishes that were ready were backlogged at the kitchen waiting for the servers to deliver them to the customers.  I feel like the servers are not trained well, they couldnt handle such large volume of customers at the same time.  we waited at least 25 mins for our food and drinks.  When we got our food, the food was a bit cold from sitting kitchen countertop for too long.  

After we got the bill, we asked them if there is a coupon for free ice cream (that's one of the main reason why came here lol).  The server told us they ran out of the coupons. i was pretty disappointed.  As we left the restaurant, we walked pass the cashier and saw a WHOLE PILE of ice cream coupons on the table.  What a liar! 

Dont think I will be returning..."}
{"text":"This time my experience was a lot better! I'd probably give it 3-3.5 stars.

Had lunch today this time instead of the happy hour set meals. I decided to try Moji again because of all the mentions of the revamped menu on Instagram and my friend also mentioned that it had gotten better.

I decided to try some of the new menu items given my experience with the older ones. They're less pricey than I thought they were - not sure if they've changed anything. I decided to try out the crispy gyu don and we also got a spicy mayo tempura rice.

The food was as expected, very nicely presented - but portions were much larger this time. Perhaps that's the difference between lunch and happy hour? My crispy gyu don was nice. There was a sweet soy sauce on the beef and the rice with tempura bits. The beef wasn't dry and was sliced very thinly. All drizzled with mayo - it seemed like a lot of mayo at first but it was actually quite light and mixed well with the sweetness of the soy sauce. Served with edamame and slices of cantaloupe. Being nitpicky here but I think they could have salted the edamame more. Comes with miso soup which we didn't touch because it was way too salty. It was around 9 dollars for the whole thing for what is essentially beef, rice, and tiny side dishes but it was tasty enough that it didn't bother me too much. I felt like the apps were a little pricey though. It was 4.95 for 6 takoyaki balls, 5.95 for cheese or wasabi cream takoyaki.

The spicy mayo tempura rice and takoyaki we got was also quite good. The takoyaki was piping hot and I made the mistake of putting the whole thing in my mouth - the cantaloupe was useful for that cause they give you hot water instead of cold! The rest of the food comes out lukewarm - is this intentional? But still good.

We also decided to get a black milk tea soft serve. I was surprised by the taste. It tasted like bubble tea.. and I think they put tapioca sometimes but I didn't get any. Given that it tasted like bubble tea it was slightly artificial tasting - but still decent, though I probably wouldn't crave it or get it again. And more on the icy side. Nothing super amazing - I'd probably still go to Wooffles and Cream across the parking lot.

Also Vivian L. is totally right about the guy server. He really was welcoming and friendly and part of what made my experience a much better one! The music was also on point with a very coffeeshop (think Norah Jones) vibe so it was really quiet during lunch - would be good for chatting with friends. Not sure if this is the place to do work though.

Consider me a convert based on the food and service and atmosphere of this experience. The decor still doesn't get me but my focus is on the food and service. Overall a nice experience and I'm more likely to come back. Kudos to the people at Moji for working to grow and develop their menu."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to come here for their $5 event. It was a pretty good deal, they also offered 50% off all the drinks when you order ramen ! 

Tomato ramen with chicken - The broth didn't have much tomato taste it to. I wished the tomato flavour was more intense!!! Hey, I did order the \"tomato\" ramen for a reason. Few pieces of fresh tomato aren't going to do anything to the broth... =.=\" The chicken and boiled egg were made perfectly! The portion was kind of small. I imagine my friends still feeling hungry after eating this. Overall, it was still a pretty satisfying bowl of ramen.  3.5/5 

Coconut matcha bubble tea - I'm kind of picky on my bubble tea. This was a pretty bad drink. Firstly, it was sooooo sweet.( I ordered less sweet.) The drink tasted way too artificial to me. The only good thing was the strong coconut flavour. However, the taste of matcha is pretty much non- existent. Disappointed in the drink :(  I'll not recommend any bubble tea drinks from here. 1/5
 
Service was pretty good ! All the servers were really nice ! 5/5

Will I visit again ? Maybe ? :) I'm definitely staying away from the bubble tea drinks. 

Side note: They do a paper ordering system which I like."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. The place was empty except a single person having some udon. I thought this place would be much busier since its a new place. Not a good sign but I hope this review will help them out a bit.

Outside the restaurant has a wood type design and it makes the restaurant look a bit incomplete but I assure you its a completely finished restaurant. Nice and spacious. This restaurant replaces Nak Won. Poor Nak Won :(

My dad was complaining the whole time about the first impressions of the restaurant. The outside looks unfinished. There is not enough variety on the menu. He didn't like how all the cups were different. He wanted tea to be served instead of just boiled water. He didn't like how all the chairs in the restaurant looked different. He thought the tables were cheap. And he kept on going on and on. Some of the things he pointed out may hold true but once he began eating his dish the complaining stopped and he even had some good things to say about the food. 

My dad got the beef with rice (Gyu rice) $8.50 - There is a lot going on when you take a closer look at the dish. Other than the beef and rice there was avocado, thinly sliced apple, ginger, a nice runny boiled egg and on the side a miso soup. 

I got the curry beef with rice (Curry Gyu rice) $8.95 - This dish had all the same as the above dish but with curry sauce which had some potatoes and carrots. I thought the dish tasted excellent and gives stiff competition for the restaurant Donburi. My only complaint is that the dish could be a bit larger for us big eaters out there :) 

Also got a chance to try the beef udon (Gyu udon) $9.50 - It had many of the same items as above. (sliced apple, avocado, runny boiled egg but in addition it had corn on the cob and tofu. The udon was cooked perfectly. Not too soft or hard but just the right amount of chew. 

Another dish we got was the seafood udon $11.95 - There was veggie, squid and shrimp tempura on the side. The shrimp tempura was very large and tasty. 

To top it off we tried a hot taro milk tea for $2 - The cup was huge and was filled to the top. We shared it among three people it was so large. Great value at $2 but I think this might be special grand opening pricing. Drink was nice and sweet and tasted pretty good.

Overall a great place for some Japanese donburi or udon."}
{"text":"Really like the food here, its simple but done well. details are put in presentation and price is more than reasonable.
environment is simple clean cut, and great for small family or even to go by your self if you'd like to grab a bite and a drink to study. 
Free Wifi in any restaurant is always a plus.

They have good dessert too/ But recently I tried their Durian softserve and it was not to my liking. it tasted more like medicine flavour to me and was very synthetic. Didn't have to real Durian taste. Their other usual flavors such as Taro and green tea are usually great tho!"}
{"text":"Another new and upcoming place that had not too long ago opened up around town. Been here twice so far for lunch and both visits were very pleasant and I enjoyed both my visits. 

I had gotten to try a Karage and Bura Mayo Don. Both don's were pretty good for how it's made and prepared. The karage was juicy and fried nicely. The mayo included in the chicken really makes the whole don more delicious as when your eating it with rice it helps soak up the sauces and distinguishes the fried batter of the chicken. The other don was a pork don I believe, it was also very tasty as the pork was cooked well and not chewy when served. 

All don's come with edamame, fruit, and egg (or 2) and garlic. It's sorta funky how they have fried food and in the same bowl they have fruit in there.. Also all orders come with miso soup which is good. 

Also have tried the Matcha green milk tea for only $2, it's just OK.. it's a pretty cheap drink to get but nothing really too special.. Pretty good place to get japanese don's since there aren't that may around in the area."}
{"text":"This place is probably one of my favorite places for lunch. I love how spacious and more importantly how kid friendly this place is. 

Pricing - I found that they are reasonable and not too over the top. 

Portion wise - at first glance it doesn't seem like much; but once you finish eating - you realize that the portion was gauged just right to fill you up without stuffing you full. 

Service - it is friendly and well paced. But they are willing to rectify mistakes if they happened. So I like that a lot. 

Atmosphere is casual and relaxed for when you do dine in. 

My go-to - crab meat and avocado rice bowl; but their chicken kaarage isn't too bad either. I find that I do prefer their rice bowls over their udon bowls more. 

Only reason this place isn't top marks yet, is that I have yet to try their dessert - which look amazing."}
{"text":"This place is like a Lil Japan gem in Markham! My only reason for the 1 star is because it's cold inside! :(. The food here is amazing! I had the buta don and yum so good! We also ordered the takoyaki and matcha green tea and it's so bombbbb probably the best Takoyaki out there! The matcha green tea definitely helps the coldness there. 

The staff are very friendly and helpful with their opinions. The decor is cute... awkward for me saying that but it comes off as cute haha. The parking here can be a pain... as there are so many other restaurants in the area. The other items on the menu look delicious and definitely going to try more dons! Don't get me started on the ice cream!  Can't wait to try those!

Definitely will be back here!"}
{"text":"Curiosity brought me to this place. Unfortunately I was not as impressed as some of the other reviews.

Staff: We were seated promptly, and they took our order after flagged someone down. They brought us our food and drinks in a timely order. It took a while with the bills, in fact we had paid the bill and money was sitting on the table for a good 15 minutes before someone took it. There were three wait staff and only four of their tables were filled, so I expected a little more service.

Ambience: It's very modern and white. The seating is comfortable and they're playing Japanese songs over the speakers. It's very open, so it can get quite loud in there. Although the place was fitting for a Japanese restaurant, I think it could've done with a splash of colour or artwork on the walls.

Food: I ordered the Seafood Tempura Udon. The tempura was excellent, the udon was ordinary, but I found it strange to have cantelope. The flavours were good, but nothing special. In addition I ordered the Ebi Mayo and the Karaage. Both were really heavy on the mayo but were delicious nonetheless. I hated the Cheese Takoyaki, it honestly made me nauseous. I had never had cheese with my Takoyaki before and I think this place has turned me off from trying it again, even at a different restaurant. To drink I had a Hot Taro Milk Tea, it came with marshmallows and that was nice.

Overall, the food wasn't anything special, a few were done well, but some other's I'll avoid next time."}
{"text":"Came on a wed to try their afternoon special. A small rice, side, and a drink for 5.99 the portion is a bit small but for that price it's a steal. They were short of staff but apologized for the wait. The atmosphere is very nice also. I'll come try the dessert next time"}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service

Mismatched everything! Cute interior! Those were my first two thoughts when I entered this place with my family. Well, that and the fact that the heat wasn't working on a Sunday night, but since we were all wearing thick jackets we decided to stay, especially seeing the positive reviews here. 

The restaurant was empty when we arrived at around 8:30pm, with only two tables occupied. Regardless, we stayed and looked at the menu, which wasn't very extensive and mostly covered the fundamentals of Japanese comfort food. I ordered a curry gyu udon, added a grill squid as an appetizer, and topped it off with a cup of hot chocolate with marshmallows due to the lack of heat in this place that night.

The hot chocolate came first, and I liked how the marshmallows melted into the hot chocolate as it was sitting. The taste was a little bland though, and reminded me more of a latte than actual hot chocolate. The grill squid came after, and after mixing the squid with the sauce and bonito it tasted very good! The squid is chewy, but not too tough or not too soft, and the sauce was done perfectly. Finally, the curry gyu udon had excellent curry and decent beef. The udon is good if you like it on the chewy side, but I can see some customers not liking it due to the slightly tougher than usual texture.

If you order any of the donburis, it comes with a free miso soup. However, I successfully requested one despite me ordering udon, and I must say it was one of the better miso soups I've drank.

My parents possessed two free uji matchas, so I decided to try one for dessert. It was quite good! Since it's matcha it's not as sweet as your typical green tea ice cream, but still quite flavourful.

This place is a great addition to the already busy and diverse New Kennedy Square/Peachtree plaza, but I am a little worried about whether the demand will be there for this place. Regardless, hopefully this review will help in getting more people to visit, and I'll definitely return to try some other items!"}
{"text":"Yet another Japanese restaurant in Markham, a good place to get a rice bowl. The chicken karaage rice is excellent, very crispy and yummy. I've also tried the chicken chachu rice, which is basically chicken with teriyaki sauce, also very well done.

They also have good ice cream, better than places like Tendou. It's good texture and flavour."}
{"text":"This place is good for lunch. The price is pretty good because most of the mains are under $10 plus tax. However, there aren't that many choices to choose from. I gave it a 3 stars because it wasn't something too  spectacular."}
{"text":"Second time here and was disappointed. Everything else was still great (service, decor) but the food missed the mark. I got the unagi don which I heard good things about. Not enough sauce overall and unagi was just so basic, like something I could get at t&t. I still can't get over the small portions. Overall still a decent restaurant to try if you're around looking for Japanese food but I don't think I'll visit again in the near term."}
{"text":"Came here for their afternoon tea set. Nice choice for a light late lunch!

Nothing really outstanding about this place. It's aiight and decent for their afternoon tea price! 

I ordered the:
- Avocado crab meat rice with chilled tofu and rose calpis drink: Tofu was nice and light. Rice was nothing special - it was fresh! Drink was cold and refreshing - rose taste was quite nice!

I would come back for their afternoon tea for sure, the price is pretty solid"}
{"text":"This place is no longer the run by Japanese staff. They don't have taro ice cream anymore and the food is uninspiring. WiFi is spotty."}
{"text":"At first look the restaurant is cute reminiscent of a room painted with pastels and decorated with string lights filled with eclectic furnishings.  We ordered from the Happy Hour menu as well as the regular one and noted it has changed from the previous happy hour menu which had 2 additional item we wanted to try that is now on the regular menu.

Ordered avocado and crab rice, spicy gyu rice, curry beef rice and wasabi tobiko takoyaki.  The flavours were very good, light and balanced but I would not describe it as super flavourful.  While I loved the wasabi tobiko on the takoyaki, the actual takoyaki was a little lacking; small with minimal ingredients in the batter.  The teas were excellent with real ingredients rather than tea bag flavour - hot genmacha green tea, iced peach tea and hot honey ginger citron tea.

Would I go back again? Probably so I can try the desserts and other items.  Would I recommend it to others? Yes but eaters beware, portion size is not for big appetite diners."}
{"text":"Got the Avacado Crab Meat Rice during lunch hour for $8.45. Came with a miso soup. 

IN my opinion, it's not a bad deal. The bowl is nothing spectacular, no fireworks and what not. But it is filling. Good portion for the price."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is! The food is okay but I don't think worth coming back to. Portions are quite small and honestly felt like it was some knock off japanese food. I had the chicken karage udon which didn't come out hot enough. The tuna tartare seemed like the tuna was fake fish and the takoyaki seemed to be the only thing that was normal. One thing I did thoroughly enjoy is the interior of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went after church with granny on a Sunday.  The place is bigger than I thought.  The music was shlightly too loud.  Was happy that they use ceramic crockery and not plastic.  They don't have ramen but rice and udon.  Chairs may back against your table so be careful when kids run toward you.  The peach yoghurt drink I had was a little too light in flavour and consistency. The beef in the Gyu Don waa slightly dry and stiff, and the Gyu Don itself was a little under sauced. Happy to see the pickled ginger, edamame and pieces of fruit on it though. The egg in granny's Gyu Don was only slightly juicy and mine was hardly so. Granny had ginger fruit tea which smelled great and tasted good.  Careful with the grains and flakes in it though.  They tickled granny's throat. The server told me they no longer have mochi so I was a moderately disappointed because a large portion of their dessert menu is therefore rendered obsolete. Portion may not be enough to feed a guy for dinner. They only have two Ice Cream flavours--macha and taro. I tried the macha one and the flavour was good."}
{"text":"3.5
A nice Japanese eatery.  Why this didn't happen sooner I don't know.

Pros:
Authentic Japanese eats
Friendly service

Cons:
Not too much variety

Came here on a whim on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  Coming in, this place looks a bit like an art classroom to me.  The tables are pretty simplistic but the chairs are all over the place.  Each table has different chairs.  I don't think any table for 4 had two of the same chairs with it.  It's quirky and goes well with the relaxed vibe this place is going for.

The menu is very colourful and has pics for every entree they have which I like.  More pictures equals better experience for people not familiar with that cuisine in my opinion.  My GF got the chicken karaage udon and I got the pork (buta) udon. A takoyaki side was also ordered as well. The food comes out pretty quickly after you order it.

Even though the picture in the menu has the chicken already in the bowl with the udon, it actually comes with the chicken in a separate bowl from the udon which is a good thing.  The chicken was done very well, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I really wish my pork udon would of come in separate bowls as well.  The pork was done very well too, but the sauce the pork comes with totally takes over the taste of the broth.  I had a very saucy broth which I wasn't a big fan of.  The takoyaki was one of the better ones I've had.  They come out piping hot and have a generous amount of octopus.  

Now, if you're not a fan of rice or udon soup noodles, you might not like this place too much.  It's basically beef, pork, chicken, shirmp and veggie tempura on rice or udon.  That's it for entrees. What they do, they do pretty well though.  The service here like most Japanese eateries is excellent.  

This is a nice place for a lunch but based on variety I might go elsewhere for dinner.  A meal for 2 will run you anywhere from 20-40 depending on how many sides you get."}
{"text":"I had the gyudon with crispy bits and Japanese mayo along with a rose calpris drink.
The rice came with a small miso soup and was a decent sized. It had nice toppings like edamame and a Japanese flavoured soft boiled egg. The gyudon itself didn't need the mayo but the crispy tempura bits was a nice touch.
The prices here are fair, most dinner options are under ($10). The tempura don I've had before had more toppings than most tempura dishes at comparable restaurants.
The rose calpris drink was picture perfect and very instagram worthy. The flavours don't go together very well and leave you regretting not picking another drink. For as a $2 add-on to your dinner, I shouldn't be complaining.
Their soft serve is very nice, I enjoy the green tea and taro one. I don't really care for the parfait toppings much but the ice cream is a much try.
Another small complaint is that anytime I have a soup udon, they seem to give you very little soup. If you have this issue, you can bring it up to a server and they will happily fix it for you. I find their service well above par for restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I just come for the Happy Hour. Great price and beautiful decor. The food isn't bad. My friends and I all got a rice bowl and enjoyed both the sauce and hot sauce! The portions are small but tasted pretty good and overall good value for $9.00 after tax."}
{"text":"This review is 70% decor and 30% quality of soft serve dessert.  Moji is attractive,  bright,  and busy with a clientele of primarily young adults and working professionals.  It is trendy, with a strong presence of wood accents. I came here only for take-out ice cream.  Unfortunately, it wasn't quite what I'd hoped for.  Specifically,  it was a bit too icy and lacked in the richness I would desire in ice cream,  even of the Japanese variety. I would say that Tendou down the street takes a definite leap over this frozen dessert!! Service was also a bit slow at the counter for ice cream.  On the plus side,  it is Moji is  super cheap! There's also a cute instagram photo frame you can pose in."}
{"text":"It's cute, that's about it. The mismatch chairs with random decorations kind of puts me off. Unfortunately, the price for say unagi rice (eel rice) was roughly 12 dollars, and from the portions that I saw, was not even close to worth it. The service was poor, the waitress wouldn't even walk up to me when I was asking for help, just stood at the other side of the place gesturing (she was not busy). Ended up trying their happy hour menu, teriyaki chicken (spicy). The difference between the spicy and non-spicy chicken was just a puddle of Sriracha sauce. The takoyaki that came with it was pretty much the best part, the iced strawberry green tea was okay, but they didn't mention it was roasted green tea, and I wasn't a fan. Maybe this place is for you, but I definitely won't be recommending."}
{"text":"The decor for this place is really unique. And the wait was not long at all when we went on a Saturday around 2:30. Would definitely return for the value but the food is a hit and miss for some things."}
{"text":"Update: I see its getting a huge audience and no longer do we get the restaurant to ourselves. It seems they are still learning to manage a full house. I still enjoy the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The ramen I ordered was far better at Sonuka and it was the exact same ramen. For dessert, I had the matcha soft serve.. It tasted like water down matcha.. Overall not worth the price that I paid for. The service was decent but overall the food was so disappointing, it overpowered my first experience."}
{"text":"3.5/5

The first impression I got when I walked into the restaurant is that it's very clean, spacious, and has a cute young vibe - they play nice jrock/jpop music. 

Miso soup: Miso soups are usually too salty for me but not Moji's, their miso soup is just right. 

Spicy mayo buta (pork) don: Solid choice. My only comment would be that it could be warmer (temperature is a little too cool for my liking) and spicier (tasted like a regular mayo buta don). 

Curry prawn tempura udon: Good one! My gf really liked it! I'd prefer it more saucey though.

Taro milk tea (cold): It's a good deal for only 2 dollars more on top of your order. It's not too strong, maybe even a little diluted but the sweetness is just right. Very well mixed - not powdery. 

Twist soft serve: A twist of Matcha and Taro with a pocky stick. Not bad. 

Summary: Portions are quite large and each entree comes with a miso soup. I would come here again if I'm in the area. Moji is a solid competitor among other restaurants in this plaza."}
{"text":"Food is alright, more of a dessert spot. Nothing mind blowing. Store is quite hidden, didn't know it was there for a long time. 

Ordered 3 dishes, I think that was almost the entire menu. Will go back for dessert again. But there are alot of selection if I was just looking for matcha ice cream."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner on the weekend. The restaurant faces Kennedy but is hard to find if you're driving in the plaza. It's a cute little restaurant with unmatched tables and chairs. 

The service was great and the waiters/waitresses were very attentive. Food wise, we ordered two appetizers - seaweed salad and takowasa. Both taste good with reasonable price. Definitely recommend the takowasa for wasabi lover. For the main, we ordered a teriyaki chicken rice and an unagi rice. They both came with two pieces of cantaloupe, some edamame, and a soft boiled egg. These three sides were cold/room temperature, we felt like they were prepared ahead of time. The chicken was kind of over-cooked and we wish the unagi would have more sauce. Each rice dish also came with complementary miso soup, which was hot and not overly salty.

We didn't have the chance to try their drinks/desserts this time. They seem to have a good variety of desserts - mostly matcha and they are served in cute mason jars. Will probably come back for it next time!"}
{"text":"This is a really cute place to have lunch. This place is across the parking lot from the chinese mall. I loved the decor and the service was very nice. The food though was not impressive. I came here to try their $5.99 happy hour special, which is a rice dish, with a side, and a drink. I got the regular gyudon and was disappointed that the meat was very dry and rough in texture. The flavour was nice, but the texture made me think of dried jerky. The portion was much smaller than I anticipated...I would say could be a nice snack. On its own though at regular price I do not think it is worth it. 

I also ordered the black milk tea soft serve and some cheese takoyaki both were tasty. The taste of the soft serve though reminded me of thai milk tea. And the takoyaki balls seemed to be deep fried? There was an interesting crispy texture."}
{"text":"Never come here on a weekend... it was practically impossible to find parking. I think I've vented about parking at this plaza before. Anyhow, we were able to make same day reservations and the staff were all very courteous. The food came out pretty quickly. 

I ordered the Curry Veggie Tempura Rice (R15). So much rice..Wish there was more curry sauce. The veggie tempura was good. My fav piece was prob. the avocado tempera. 

If you're thinking about their Cookies and Cream Waffle Ice cream (or others similiar). Think twice, as the so called waffle was just tiny tiny bits. I thought it was going to come with a waffle cone of some sort. The size could've been larger. Also they ran out of vanilla and we had to pick only matcha or strawberry. Wasn't worth it at all."}
{"text":"This place is so pretty! All the food are well cooked and the service is friendly! Can't wait to visit here again"}
{"text":"A cozy restaurant that I would like to go for lunch or tea time when I woke up late. For tea time,  there are few combos you can choose from, which all serve with a mini bowl of rice, side dish, and a drink. The food is decent, you would not expect much since it only costs around $6-7 for the combo. But overall it is a great place to chat with friends."}
{"text":"Came back just for dessert tonight and this was a quick one. Arrived at around 8:20pm and was advised last call was in 10 minutes. We placed our order within 5 minutes and we were served promptly.

I ordered a Taro Milk tea ($2) which was pretty good. A bit sweet after a while but still good.

I really enjoyed the Matcha Ice Cream Parfait. It was just full of surprises inside lol. The parfait consists of corn flakes, lychee jelly, assorted pieces of chocolate, fruits and Mochi. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Pros:
- Didn't wait long for a table with an arrival time of 2:30 on a Saturday
- Great value. Large portions and good taste for what you pay for
- Restaurant looked clean and friendly staff

Cons:
- None

Ordered: 
$11.95 Unagi Don - Huge piece of unagi, standard otherwise
$6.95 Tuna Tataki - Standard, same as most places
$4.80 Baby Octopus - Not bad, sweet and tasted like squid
$3.90 Agedashi Tofu - Standard, a little too much sauce
$5.99 Veggie Curry Dong Tea Time Special - Got a seaweed salad and drink with this deal. Nice value for $6

Conclusion:
I would definitely come back. Although the items I ordered were not outstanding or to die for, the portion and quality for price is very well worth a return when in the area. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. They changed the menus and even added some lunch specials. 

I've ordered the \"R4\" Chicken Karrage Rice several times. But the last visit here, I was slightly disappointed because the portion of the food really went down. The first few times I came here, the rice bowl would be filled! But today's there was just so much rice, literally only 3 pieces of chicken and way too much mayo. The dish was not worth it, in our opinion. 

We also ordered the R8 Curry Gyu Rice, and this was very tasty! I think this was worth the buy.

Unfortunately, the matcha green lattes were very disappointing. We've had this several times before too and never had this experience. It was all milk and no matcha."}
{"text":"It's very average that i wouldn't go back again. The seating is not comfy either."}
{"text":"Ordered from their happy hour menu! Spicy beef rice, the first choice of appetizer, and first choice of the drinks. Overall, I feel like they don't put enough meat in the meal and try to cover it up with mostly rice. The \"spicy\" beef was only drizzled with a bit of hot sauce on the top and I was a bit disappointed.The drink tasted bland and bitter, but that's because it was traditional iced tea(I think). The appetizer was really small and came with only two pieces!

Would recommend to try at least once though."}
{"text":"Came here solely for dessert. We arrived at around 8:30 on a sunday and had to wait for about 10 mins. 

Dessert is 4 stars. 
I love durian so i got the durian dessert with ice cream. At first i thought the dessert is with durian ice cream, but its actually with black milk tea ice cream topped with a spoon size of durian (i feel that they could be more generous with the durian). It was pretty good as the ice cream wasn't too sweet, but still creamy. It was topped with gummy bears, pocky sticks, marshmallows and some jelly. 

My friend got an ice cream and it came with the ramune marble drink. It was our first time trying the ramune marble drink so opening the bottle was a challenge for all of us. The waitress saw us struggling but didn't offer any help. We eventually opened it and poured some into the ice cream. The drink reminds me of an asian version of root beer float. 

Service is 3 stars. 
None of the waitresses came to check up on us. We had to wave our hands to grab their attention."}
{"text":"This restaurant is new to the markham scene and I would put 3.5 stars if possible. It is truly an average restaurant that is pretty quiet. You could spend some time with your friends here without feeling rushed. Food was OK and pricing is good. The tempera shrimp is fried and is pretty good. Drinks are worth the add on. I went twice. The first visit was when it first opened and it was excellent. Second visit was about a month later (Aug) and it was not very good. These two different experiences have really left me questioning if a 3rd visit was necessary for this review. But it is fair to give them 3.5 stars after much thought."}
{"text":"Food was tasty but really wasn't anything special. I went later afternoon so the restaurant was empty but I imagine it would be packed at peak times. 

I had the unagi don which was serviceable but nothing that really impressed me. The takoyaki is worth mentioning - above average. I had the mango yogurt and my friend had the matcha milk tea - both were OK, way too sweet even after I asked them to go light on the sugar/syrup. 

May return just because of its proximity and convenience but otherwise it's not what it's hyped up to be."}
{"text":"I really like the place. It's clean, new and hip! Whatever meal you buy, you can add a drink for $2. We tried to get the waiter to hook us up with more drinks but unfortunately my feminine wiles weren't working that night. Get the iced peach lemonade... Soooooooo good. You can add tapioca or jelly if you please too. An entree is about $10. Got the beef udon and it was pretty good. Enough to fill your tummy! 

Staff is great, quick service and food is on point. Oh and dessert? Soft serve.... Matcha and mango or you can twist it! I don't usually eat matcha or soft serve, but I had it in a waffle cone and it was pretty good. $3-4 ... So worth it! Better than going for overprices ice cream at sweet Jesus or wherever. 

I would go back to redo this all over again."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place and it was a really great first experience. 

This restaurant serves up some yummy Japanese dishes that are different than your usual sushi place. 

We started with the baby octopus which was served cold in a sweet sauce, this dish was flavorful and unique and we really enjoyed this. We also shared the edamame and karaage, both were delicious and generously portioned to share. For mains we tried the beef gyu bowl and the chicken curry bowl. Both of these were packed with flavour, the chicken didn't have much actual chicken but the potatoes, carrots and the curry sauce were delicious and hearty, it felt like Japanese comfort food. The beef bowl had a generous portion of beef and rice, there was also egg, some edamame, ginger and a couple of slices of cantaloupe in the bowl which was nice and refreshing. We also ordered the iced genmaicha tea which had little pieces of coconut jelly in the bottom, we really enjoyed this drink. 

For dessert we had the matcha green tea with Oreo pieces and this was really yummy and a nice way to finish the meal. 

All of this food came to about $50 with tax and tip which is reasonable for all the items we ordered. 

The restaurant itself is really modern and trendy looking, lots of intentional mismatched furniture, light fixtures and other features give a sort of hipster vibe to it. It offered a nice dining environment.

The crowd is mostly younger people but we saw families and all sorts of people filling the tables. 

The service was pretty good, we got our orders in and our food pretty quickly and our servers were courteous however they seemed a bit overwhelmed with the volume of customers they had. 

Overall a cute place with some good, inexpensive bites to eat. I can't wait to come back and try more items on this menu!"}
{"text":"This resto is as \"Markham-hipster\" as they come. Exposed cement walls and wooden chairs restored from all different walks of life. Markham-hipster and not just hipster because there's some cutesy element to the decor that brands the place as undeniably Asian. They are known for serving up a mean Japanese rice bowl. I visited Moji just for lunch and ordered the gyu rice and unagi cheese rice bowls.

The gyu rice was pretty good. Just above average. Rice wasn't spectacular nor memorable.

But I have a bone to pick with the unagi cheese rice. I paid $1 more for the unagi cheese rice than the unagi rice because you guessed it... cheese. There was the smallest dash of cheese melted on my unagi. It made absolutely no change to the taste of the bowl. Not only that but my unagi was just bearably slimy and very fishy. Either it needed a while longer to be cooked or the unagi that wound up filleted and fried in my bowl was super fat. I had to up the amount of rice on my spoon to balance out the strong fishy taste.

All in all... not nearly an exceptional meal. Service was decent. Food could be made better. Wouldn't shoot them down nor recommend them."}
{"text":"Decor: 5 (I love the giraffe shelf!)
Food: 4
Service: 4

I think I love almost everything about this place! It's simple, cute, relaxing and spacious.  There are different chairs for each table so you get to pick whichever you like.  

They opened recently so there's not much on the menu.  The girl told us they will have new menus next week (or soon) and you can order a drink for $2 when you order any Donburi/Udon.

We ordered the Wasabi Takoyaki (barely tasted the wasabi), Beef Udon, Buta Mayo Donburi, Matcha Milk Tea and Fruit Ginger Tea.  We wanted to order the Matcha Latte but they said they didn't have it.

Food came quick and they were well proportioned, even the drinks came in a large cup! I was quite surprised that they used the Mighty Leaf Ginger Twist tea bags because they're usually pretty expensive!  They only charge $2.95 so it's actually pretty cheap considering the size.

When we got the bill, the girl came to ask about the food and if there were any recommendations. She also gave us the $2 drinks and some free matcha ice cream coupons! We'll definitely come back for more :)

They accept cash, MC, and Visa."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for dinner tonight after reading all the great reviews on Yelp.  I like the selection of the rice bowls such as Gyu don, unagi Don and buta Don....we tried all three tonight.  It was all simple dishes but very tasty.  However, the takoyaki (octopus balls) wasn't great, I would skip this dish next time.  We didn't order the tempura shrimp which looks really good.  Definitely will try this dish next time.  We also finished off with the matcha blueberry cheesecake twist ice cream parfait...this was so yummy!!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Only been here once but I'm definitely coming back again! Honestly I never pay attention to the strip of restaurants that face Kennedy but the contrasting wooden sign with bold black letters really caught my eyes when I first passed by. The interior is also very bright and cute, not something you'd normally see (especially at Peach Tree Centre). 

I'm a huuuge sucker for unagi so obviously I had to get the unagi don with cheese. Presentation and taste were FLAWLESS though I wish they could have added more cheese to the dish (I literally ate all of it in one bite. . .). 

The only complaint I have is the seating. I don't know if my legs are just abnormally long or something but I had a hard time squeezing in at the wooden tables. Maybe the booths are better idk. Or maybe I just got a really short table or something? Definitely gonna try their afternoon tea specials next time, I heard they're very worth it for the price!"}
{"text":"The restaurant seems more like a family run type of shop. I had the beef udon which was quite tasty and flavourful. The only thing this restaurant lacked was probably experience in running a restaurant. Service was extremely slow as they may have been lacking kitchen as well as wait staff. My soup for the udon was a bit cold. I would try this place again not during dinner rush."}
{"text":"Came here couple times for their happy hour set but my overall experience here were quite disappointed in the service and food quality...

It takes them REALLY long time to make the food even though it's just small portion of food and appetizer. I ordered their beef rice bowl and it took them almost half an hour to make it. I mean I wouldn't mind if they could give us some appetizer at least to make us feel their cooking time is shorter or anything. Or maybe it's just me that easily get annoyed when I'm hungry lol 

Also, their food portion was really small and even just for a girl. I don't eat lunch before I come here but it's happy hour set so of course the portion is gonna be smaller but I didn't expect that after that small bowl of rice I'll still have room for another bowl of rice...compare to other places like Hong Kong style restaurant I can get double of the portion while paying the same amount of the money.

However, good thing about this place is the environment and atmosphere of the restaurant were pretty satisfying and nicely decorated. It's definitely a good place for friends to gather or couples coming in for a date to chat for a bit. Oh, and the pictures you take here is definitely instagramable ;) well, maybe depends on your photographing skills too."}
{"text":"Pretty cute place with typical, basic Japanese dishes. Portions are pretty generous and flavours are on point, but leaning towards the saltier side. Drinks, I find, are also on the sweeter side, hot or cold regardless. 

The music is kinda loud here... which is weird since it's not really a hangout. Considered asking the waitresses to turn it down a bit at one point.

There's quite a bit of seating available. Place is spacious and not crammed with chairs and tables like you're elbowing the table next to you. Decor is simple and modern with a homey feel. It was also very clean, considering it is still pretty new.

It's a bonus that their dessert menu is quite decent and not just slices of cake delivered from elsewhere. As of now it seems like they specialize in green tea soft serves although the green tea flavour is lacking a bit and mostly tastes like cream. Hopefully they can improve on that. 

Overall the dishes' presentation is nice and neat which I would give bonus points for. Flavours however needs to lighten up a bit."}
{"text":"For being in Markham and being authentic - Moji deserves 4 stars! The customer services was great , interior of the restaurant was calm and comfortable. 

I ordered the assorted tempera and squid as apps and curry chicken udon & don as mains.
Assorted Tempura: It was great, there wasn't a huge amount batter which was great. It was light and well, fried.  The quid was great, it wasn't too chewy (not over cooked) and it still had flavors. 

Curry Udon/Curry Don - It did the job, personally i would request for more curry sauce so i didnt have to be stingy with each noodle or bit of rice. The rice they used was japanese rice. The meal came with miso soup as well

Overall - i will go back due to authenticity & location"}
{"text":"The price is too expensive for the quality and the quantity of the food. Not much service. Wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and was immediately impressed with the super cute decor! Love how everything is mismatched and abstract!
I love the relaxing atmosphere here!~

I came on a Saturday and it was pretty empty probably because not many people know about this place. The location makes it kind of difficult to spot as well since their banner is not very eye catching  :o

Food quality has completely surpassed my expectations and everything was delicious! I ordered the unagi don (eel bowl) and it was really yummy! My mom ordered the spicy gyu don (spicy beef bowl) and the beef was super sweet and soft! I tried my sister's pork udon and the broth was super tasty as well. The tempura was just your average tempura but the takoyaki was surprisingly good! 

The portions are pretty reasonable but I did notice that they are a lot smaller for take-out. 

I love how they add avocado in almost all their dishes and apple slices too! Extra stars for the nice deco and garnishes!
Their teas are also really nice. I ordered the fruit tea and it came in a nice big mug! I tried my sister's matcha milk tea and was really surprised with the rich matcha flavor! It actually tastes like real matcha tea instead of the fake powder ones in many bbt stores! 

Service was pretty friendly, nothing too special.

Overall, I really like this restaurant and I would come again to try their matcha desserts!  Definitely worth a try so make sure to try it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Moji was advertised like crazy on IG by the foodies and I had to give it a try .. It's so cute!

First off, the location was so hard to find. I had to circle the plaza (and it's a big ass plaza). Moji is facing Kennedy Rd and does not have a big sign to assist in location. The only way I realized it was the correct place is by the stencils shown in the windows. 

The place was semi packed on a Wednesday. The restaurant is actually really well decorated and a great place to take pictures in. 

The service was friendly and able to make recommendations. 

Verdict: the icecream is not spectacular. I feel like I can buy grocery store icecream and sprinkle the toppings on top myself.

Overall, it's an ok place to come when you want to take cute IG pictures but I love Wooffles & Cream inside the food court of the main mall a lot more"}
{"text":"E-MOJI of choice? Definitely [relaxed], [smiley], and [hand up]. (Edit: forgot emojis don't work on Yelp lol.)

[relaxed] - the restaurant is homey and comfortable. The roomy clean decor of the restaurant is inviting and the service is happy and attentive. 

[smiley] - the food was great! There's a lot of options on the cute menu and wooden board presenting the drinks. I had the takoyaki, the matcha milk tea, and the gyudon ($20 including tax and tip) . All were pretty standard compared to other places, although the gyudon is on the smaller side and certainly not as drenched in sauce as I'd like. I was one of the only ones there on Monday night so everything came out very quickly; I had all three items in less than 15 minutes. 

[hand up] - I can't wait to come back to try more of the menu! I also got a free cone coupon after eating!"}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating

Ebi Mayo
Tempura fried shrimp, came in 5 pieces. I liked how the shrimps were big, not like the skinny shrimps you normally get in shrimp tempura. Batter was good, didn't taste greasy at all. It was topped with mayo and this other orange sauce that I don't know what it is - i would like to think it's spicy mayo but it wasn't spicy at all. Tastes good, nice appetizer.

Gyu rice ($8.50) 
I ordered the Gyu rice, and added extra chicken for only $2. At first I thought they would just add the chicken into the Gyu bowl but nope, the chicken comes in a separate bowl so there's good value in the amount of meat you get for $2. Apparently it was terriyaki chicken, but just tasted like mixed chicken and onions stir fry in soya sauce. The chicken meat was slightly dry. The gyu rice comes with beef stir fried with onions, edamame, soft boil egg, and 2 pieces of cantelope in the bowl, and miso soup on the side. I found it quite nice how there were other toppings to go with the rice. There was actually quite a lot of meat in the bowl too so I found that surprising. The beef meat was soft and well seasoned. The soft boil egg was more on the cooked side, I personally like mine more runny but it still tasted good.

Unagi rice ($11.95)
The bowl comes with edamame, soft boil egg, and 2 pieces of cantelope in the bowl, and miso soup on the side.The unagi was quite a large piece, however it did lack of some sauce though. It seemed like the restaurant probably just went out and bought a pre-made one and slapped it on top of rice. Still tastes good though. 

Hot Japanese Green Tea ($3.80)
This was quite a joke in my opinion. Not sure why they would charge this much for hot green tea - I know it was in a tea bag, but....quite over priced I must say. And quite strange too because they served lychee jelly inside? Not sure how jelly is supposed to go with a hot green tea bag drink.....

Side comment - I did not like the service. Whenever I raised my hand to ask them something, they see me and look at me, but then look around elsewhere but they walk towards me so I'm like so confused if they actually saw me. They could at least nod their head to acknowledge they see me asking for service. Also, when they served my Gyu rice the chicken was missing, I originally thought they would just add it in the bowl but my bowl only had beef so I asked the waitress and all she did was pull my tray away without answering or saying anything. I really questioned if she knew what i was talking about. But then I saw another waitress walking over with a small bowl of chicken so I told the waitress \"oh never mind, I didn't know it comes separately\", and then they both walked away.
..............

They had a huge sign outside advertising their twist icecream (Taro and Green Tea) but turns out they don't have Taro and it was blueberry instead so I passed. Would help if you took away the sign so you aren't doing false advertising. Hopefully next time I can try it.
I saw they have Afternoon tea specials Monday - Friday from 2:30 - 5pm, the rice bowls are only $5.99! That's a really good deal compared to their regular price.

It's slightly frustrating because I liked the food, but disliked the service which would make me want to lower my rating."}
{"text":"It was honeslty a really good experience. The food wasnt too overpowering and totally filled that comfort food experience. 

Anythinf with mayo is good i had the crispy beef gyu don."}
{"text":"Great customer service! We were served fairly quickly and the amount of food was generous! The interior of this restaurant is very artsy and there are a variety of selections to choose from in the main menu! I highly recommend a visit during their happy hours (2:20-5:30pm)"}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars
I ordered the curry gyu rice. When it came, the big bowl made the portions look small but there was definitely enough to get me full. There was a mix of toppings including ginger, edamame beans, half an egg, carrots, beef, and potatoes. Curry sauce was not one bit spicy. The curry had a slight sweetness to it. The meal came with a small (miso?) soup and that was actually more salty than expected. A fair meal for the price. I thought they had ramen for some reason but it's just udon or rice.

Ambiance: 4 stars
Initially wanted to give 3 stars because the seating was not very comfortable. Hard plastic and wooden chairs but since they seemed to work well in the cozy-Japanese-home theme, I right they deserved another star. Very bright and had a sweet hipster vibe to the place. Lots of cute little pieces around the restaurant. Adorable wooden giraffe shelf, flying pigs nailed to the wall, and a wall of small shelves with small puts of flowers. 

Service: 3 stars
There were 2 ladies serving the entire restaurant. Our food came extremely quickly. I would say about 5 minutes from ordering to table. The ladies were nice but in terms of service, there really wasn't much of it. They got our order, brought us our food, and gave us our bill. 

Note: they have Wi-Fi but it's not set up for this month because they were having issues."}
{"text":"This is pretty close to where I live and while I was sad to see Nakwon go, I was excited to try this place. I've actually been here on many occasions before I finally decided to make a review. My friend and I had the following:

1. Grilled Squid ($5.95)
The first time I had it, it was heavenly! It was almost melt-in-your-mouth and I was so surprised! The past few times I've revisited, it hasn't been as amazing, but still really tender. The sauce is perfect with the squid!

2. Chicken karaage udon ($9.95)
The toppings you get with the udon and rice differ. With the udon, you don't get miso soup and the toppings include corn, half an egg, tofu, edamame and enoki mushrooms. I love the soft texture of the udon and the chicken is so crisp and delicious! The toppings were a perfect combination with the udon.

3. Chicken karaage rice ($8.95)
This comes with the miso soup and the toppings include 2 halves of an egg, ginger and edamame. The rice was a smaller portion but it was good with an appetizer. I'm glad that the chicken was consistent in that it was just as delicious. The miso soup was really bland though. 

4. Iced Genmaicha Green Tea
I asked for no sugar and it comes with tapioca but I opted out. It was really refreshing and it's only $2 with the purchase of a rice or udon! Felt like pretty authentic tea. 

5. Iced Peach Yogurt
Too sweet because of the yogurt and the peach syrup but very refreshing and also $2 with the meal. 

The service was good because the appetizer came before the meal and the server provided some side plates with the appetizer to share. I appreciated that and they were pretty attentive. I also love that the items are pretty affordable. The only reason it loses a star is because they are pretty inconsistent. Today the food came quickly but other times, I was waiting 30 minutes for an appetizer. I will definitely come more often for the afternoon tea specials on the weekdays!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and my two kids on Friday around 6 pm.
It was really nice and cute inside with light colors and miss matched chairs.
It was kid friendly.
The waitresses don't say much and they're usually around the cashier talking and you would have to wave them down.
We ordered the Takoyaki and it was delicious
Mains were:
Beef curry with rice and Karage chicken with rice
they came with soup
prices range from $9-10 for that price the portions were really small.
However, i did see that they had happy hour specials. I think it was between 2-5 pm? they have the same combos and it comes with drink for $6 i think that would be more worth it for their portions.

For dessert we got taro soft serve.
It was good but not amazing, it tasted like taro bbt slush.

It's nice to try this place once, but i will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when sifting through the yelp archives, and thought I'd give it a try. Named a Japanese eatery, but more so like most izakaya's in the GTA. 

ATMOSPHERE:

Cute and fun decor, that I think maybe people might appreciate. Interesting and colourful furniture to match. Lots of space to accommodate groups and those with babies.

FOOD:

Menu was mostly tapa style, with many dishes common to similar types of places. As usual, I was drawn most to the deep fried dishes and ramen. The presentation of the ramen was interesting, as it came deconstructed. Although unique, I prefer the toppings to be mixing in the bowl and soaking in the spicy broth. The karaage chicken and spicy shrimp were fairly forgettable. 

While it's a fairly trivial issue, I can't help but say I was a little annoyed by the \"Cookies and Cream Waffle\" ice cream I ordered. First, they didn't have vanilla ice cream. Second, the \"cookies\" was literally just one partially crushed Oreo cookie. Most annoyingly though, the \"waffle\" was literally a few tiny insy-binsy minuscule bits of crushed waffle, that I didn't  even notice until the server pointed them out to me (they didn't have a magnifying glass handy).

SERVICE:

They were fairly quick. Not overly friendly or problematic. Looked very very confused when I asked them where the \"waffle\" was in my waffle ice cream lol.

VERDICT: 

Other than the microscopic and misleading \"waffle,\" overall this place is fine. Wouldn't go out of my way to return, but may check out again."}
{"text":"Tasty and fun Japanese place with great apps and ice cream!

Moji is Japanese eatery which is focused more on udon and rice bowls while having a variety of tasty appetizers and unique flavoured soft serve ice cream. Don't expect sushi but more like don buri style meals.The decor is a modern and quirky interior with various mis-matched chairs at the tables. It is actually a great spot of families with little kids - lots of space and room for them.

Food: We came with as a big family dinner so we were able to order a wide sampling of their appetizers and main dishes. For appetizers, we had the tofu with avocado, roasted corn, takoyaki and karaage (fried chicken). Don't be fooled by the simple appearance - all of them were yummy. For example, the roasted corn has a nice layer of cheese, seaweed and mayo sauce over a lighty roasted sweet corn on a cob while the tofu and avocado was kinda like a cold refreshing salad. My favourite was the takoyaki - chewy octopus balls with bonito flakes on top! For the main, we had a variety of the beef, pork and chicken rice bowls - easy to say that these were comfort food and hit the spot. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the mains. I also ordered a rosewater lemonade which really rounded out my meals. The place also serves some unique soft serve ice cream combos e.g. durian king - ice cream flavoured with durian. 

Overall - a great place for Japanese food other than the usual sushi and terrayaki combos!"}
{"text":"Was not into this type of food, so perhaps my review is not going to agree with the masses. Portion was large, but rice and potatoes cost nothing to buy. I had a tempura curry rice, but the rice, curry sauce, and root vegetables combo reminded me of the food I would cook for myself in university days when I was hungry and just simply needed to feel full by loading up on carbs. Tempura, you really can't mess up deep-frying shrimp, and they didn't, yet it's not a food that is challenging for restaurants to make. Wait time for food was slow, it could have been quicker. Chairs and tables made me feel like I was in daycare. Awkward."}
{"text":"Good:
1. Mayo - It's pretty random I know but any dish with their mayo is great, whether it's chicken karaage or gyu don.

2. Karaage - Speaking of which, karaage is really well done.  Nice chunky pieces of juicy chicken fried to a perfect crisp.  This is usually my goto dish here.

3. Drinks - I've been here many times but only tried a drink tonight.  Drink menu had some standard bubble tea fare but also some interesting Japanese drinks like calpis.  I went adventurous and got the Rose Calpis with lychee jelly.  Drink was large and pink with a generous sprinkling of ground up rose petals.  The taste surprised me a little as it was intensely floral.  I thought it was just ok but for those who like that rose flavour, this one is a winner.  It went well with the lychee jelly.  My wife had a strawberry matcha milk tea.  It wasn't that great, no hint of matcha at all and only a faint strawberry flavour.  It tasted more like a shake to me.

Bad:
1. Udon - Wife said udon looked like someone's leftover dinner.  Udon was overcooked and soggy, the enoki mushrooms were no saving grace as they were sparse and chopped up.  I don't remember a complaint in previous visits because she usually gets this so maybe it's a one off or maybe it got worse.

2. Cash/debit only - If you read my reviews, you know how I feel about this policy.  I think prices are high enough to warrant allowing payment by credit card.

3. Water - I point this out because I distinctly remember this every time I come here.  It usually tastes like washroom.  I don't remember if it's specific to the warm water or not but the water is usually a turn off.  I got cold water tonight and it was better, but I think still a faint taste.  Could be the way the cups are washed? I have no idea.

Worth it?
Sure.  Despite some of it's flaws, Moji is ultimately more hit than miss.  The food is simple, elegantly presented, and generally well done to warrant repeat visits when that non-sushi Japanese craving hits."}
{"text":"A perfect balance between price, quality, service and ambiance. Around $12 as an average rice or noodle bowl with a nice twist on the regular Japanese dishes."}
{"text":"Popped into Moji for a super late lunch on a Sunday.  Because we arrived so late, they had their happy hour pricing available between 230p - 500p.  For $5.99, you get to choose an appetizer, main, and drink.  With my bad memory, I wish I took a picture of that menu.  In any case, based on my pictures, I ordered chilled tofu, gyu rice, and a strawberry green tea.  The hubby wanted ramen, so he ordered the toroniku ramen off the regular menu. 

When our food items arrived, we thought the portions were a bit small.  I don't know if my portions were small due to my food being for its happy hour pricing.  The tofu was good, smooth, with some soy sauce, and nori on top.  The gyu rice, I felt that there wasn't enough beef for the amount of rice given.  Flavours were ok.  Strawberry green tea was weak, not much green tea flavour at all.  The toroniku ramen came in a very small bowl.  The broth was ok, but it didn't have that rich pork taste to it.  Noodles were cooked al dente which was good.  Topping were presented on the side on a separate dish.  There were slices of pork, very thinly sliced, with some wood ear, and bamboo.  The egg, again in it's own separate dish.  For the price, $12.50, I was expecting there to be more."}
{"text":"The decor of this restaurant feels like a cafe, and it is quite open and comfortable. The meals here are not traditional Japanese dishes but more of a fusion Japanese inspired menu. They have a few basics like tempura with rice or udon, ramen, udon with chicken or beef, and the variety is established with the sauces - mostly spicy mayo or curry or cheese. They also have snack items like takoyaki and a good assortment of drinks and dessert as well. I like that their dishes and drinks are nicely presented and the portions are decent. I have been here several times and everything I have had is good. Nothing is amazing but I would say the quality is consistent and it's a good ambiance and also family friendly."}
{"text":"Moji Japanese Eatery is a welcome addition in the neighbourhood. I do like their simple menu and casual vibe. The kawaii cuteness of colour theme and mismatched furniture.

I usually have my dinner at 8 or later so never have an issue of long wait for food or inattentive service. But I can say the portion size and quality was not as good as they first opened which was a 4 star.

I have ordered:

Takoyaki ($4.99)
Curry Prawn Tempura Donburi ($11.95)
Curry Chicken Donburi ($8.95)
Gyu Donburi ($8.50)
Buta Mayo Donburi ($9.50)
Curry Gyu Udon ($9.95)
Mixed Fruit Ginger Tea
Matcha Milk Tea hot and cold
Matcha Soft Serve and Taro Soft Serve

I enjoyed most of the item aside from Buta Mayo Don. Mixed Fruit Ginger Tea was really good one time with tons of fresh fruit and ginger, then the next time was just so watery with no taste. 

I think consistency is always an issue as it really depends who was preparing the drinks for you or if the kitchen is busy or not.

If you are in the neighbourhood, it is ok to give it a try, But does not worth a special trip or the wait to just to eat any donburi in town."}
{"text":"a simplistic menu when you're looking for something easy after a long day at work. an extra two dollars for a matcha latte ain't bad either. personally I don't think the latte is sweet enough, but they do put a lot of matcha in the drink so I'll give them that. I got the mayo pork don. the meat and soft boiled egg are super flavorful and the cantaloupe makes it all really fresh and light. 
for dessert I got the rainbow mochi icecream. it came out a tad melty but it's really cute to look at lol. 
I'll definitely visit again to try all their appies! (I heard good things..)"}
{"text":"We love it here. Pricing is good and the food is good. Service is so friendly and it's so dang family-friendly here!!! We never feel like we're dying when we're eating with the kids in this restaurant. Decor is cheery and fun, the rose kalpis is delicious and refreshing and the food is consistently decent."}
{"text":"This place is so cute. The aesthetic is on point. I only got the lemonade, which was really yummy. My aunt got the soft serve which she didn't like at all and the tuna tataki which she enjoyed."}
{"text":"I was DYING to go to Moji for a really long time. Ever since it opened up! There's just not enough modern Japanese snack houses in Markham...so when I heard there was a place serving Unagi Don tea time specials for under $6 during off peak hours... I knew I had to give this place a try.

First thing I realized is that their menu is COMPLETELY different from what's mentioned online. Most of the Moji offpeak lunch special items are a lot worse than they were before. They got rid of the Chicken Teriyaki and Takoyaki and replaced the dishes with cheaper options like edamame and (really little) tempura don. The Gyudon was still there though. Thank goodness.

But here's where the bad news gets worse. It takes me like 10 minutes to call down the ONE waiter who was working at the time. But if you thought that was bad... I waited over one HOUR to get the two specials I ordered. I thought this was ridiculous since literally everyone during that time frame was ordering the same thing. I saw five of my exact order pass me over the span of the one hour taunting me. To think there would be more staff working during the busy time... or at least try to cook the dishes a little more efficiently?

I was absolutely starving by the end of it all, and the food (although pretty decent) just wasn't good enough to make up for my long wait. 

Terribly executed restaurant. You will be happier going to the 43728947329 other faster, better quality restaurants in the plaza."}
{"text":"This will pace has a nice ambience and food isn't too bad.  Their soft serve ice cream isn't the greatest but I did enjoy the tofu and avocado salad."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Love their unagi don and I really enjoyed their hot matcha milk tea. Price wise I can dig it. Will definitely try their other stuff. Also, right now when you pay your bill, you get a voucher for free ice cream so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"Resto aesthetics 5/5. Super cute Japanese eatery in NKS. I actually got lost finding this little resto but got guided by my cousin I was still sick when I ate here so I was only limited to certain things. 

I ordered a spicy udon noodle soup lunch combo with a matcha milk tea for additional $2.50. I didn't like the main dish as much. I thought when it had the word spicy it's it, the soup base is supposed to be red or orange. The \"spicy\" part was just siracha squirted on top of all the stuff.. which is not spicy to me lol. They used chicken thigh pieces as the meat and I much prefer chicken breast. If this was a katsu style dish, I think it would be much better. Aside from the meat, there were so many things going on in the soup. The soup tasted sweet and then salty sometimes. Hearty and then savoury? Weird. There was a mix of cantaloupe pieces, edamame, enoki mushrooms, corn, little garnishment and then under were the udon noodles. It didn't taste that bad but there def could be more improvements. 

On the other hand, I enjoyed my drink. Got a matcha milk tea and it tasted fresh and not powdery! 
I think I'd come next time to try the desserts and the appetizers."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers Japanese style rice (don) and udon dishes. It is located in the busy Kennedy plaza. 
It's a nice addition to the Markham area.
We had the curry chicken don and curry chicken chicken udon. Udon was chewy in a good way, prefer the udon than the rice (don). They came with thin slices of apples; apples were nice and crisp but didn't really go with the dish IMO. 

You can get any drinks (hot or cold) for $2 which is a great bargain. My husband had the lychee slush, and I had the hot taro milk tea. Slush was good; taro milk tea had nice flavour but way too sweet for my liking; sugar overloaded. 
Takoyaki was fresh, hot and delish. It was done perfectly. 

The server gave us coupon for matcha soft serve ice cream, I liked the ice cream, good match flavour. 
Food was good, service was friendly but slow that day (took a while to get our food), and their heat didn't work so it was quite freezing in the restaurant in the middle of January so I had to knock off a star."}
{"text":"I've been here twice but this is slowly becoming my favourite restaurant in Markham!

Came here twice on a weekday evening around 8pm. They close at 9pm, but it was more than enough time to sit down and have a comfortable meal. They kindly told us the closing time and when last call for the kitchen was and so we were aware and didn't have to be rushed at the end. 

When you first walk in, it's like you've walked into a pinterest inspired cafe. The tables are all wooden with colourful chairs of different kinds. The cutlery come in all sorts of shapes and sizes and the cups they gave you can even turn out different. I love the ambience here! People were on their computers doing work, some were chatting quietly to themselves; it pretty much had a coffee shop feel. The service was also very quick and attentive. We received our food after ordering in about 10 minutes. 

As for the food, I had the chicken karage with rice both visits. Most of their options were not over 11$. The meal comes with a miso soup and you can also add a drink for 2$ more. The karage was drizzled with mayo and the bowl itself had just enough flavour for me.

Overall,  I can't believe I wasn't introduced to this restaurant earlier!  I was thoroughly impressed with Moji and will definitely be bringing my friends and family back."}
{"text":"The aesthetics of this place is cute. It has a rustic clean look with its mix-matching of chairs and wooden tables. The place is well lit, a little bit hidden, and quite small. However, at no point did I ever feel cramped in this restaurant. 

The service here is average and forgettable, but no complaints as the waitress was friendly and got my order quickly. I came with a friend (and looking at the extremely similar photos, I'm sure you can guess who the friend is) on a Monday afternoon for dessert. Since it was chillier than expected that day, we debated on what to get. We settled on the oreo ice cream (swirled matcha and mango) while she also ordered an additional rose tea. Unlike many places that just look good on the menu, the presentation of both the tea and ice cream were adorable. In fact, the tea even had little flowers in it! 

Despite the tea being a little pricey, both items were still enjoyable. While it was an overall positive experience, there is nothing spectacular enough about Moji that would warrant me to return soon. However, I would be inclined to come back to try their actual dishes. Solid 3.5 stars for me."}
{"text":"2.5 stars for MOJI.

im going to keep it short.

1. 2 and a half hour dining experience for one entree and a drink with a total table of 7.  (not an enjoyable wait)

2. very unorganized...(constantly have to request for water/napkins/chopsticks.. and wrote our drink orders but never punched it in.  

3. food portion seems relatively small 

overall pretty bad experience ... food tasted okay nothing special.  i would prefer donburi for more choices by commerce gate.

their redeeming factor was that they acknowledged missing our drink orders 2 hours in...  and compensated us for the drinks.

table, had empty water, no napkins, no chopsticks.. food came out hour apart.. when everyone had empty bowls. the last udon came out.. some people got soup some didnt.. just a hot mess..  tables all around us mad... and almost 0 turnover after an hour.  

very understaffed which ruined the experience.   would i come back?  yes.. to redeem the free icecream coupon.. but not for the food."}
{"text":"After seeing the pink moose and the mismatched but aesthetically pleasing chairs, we decided to try Moji for lunch. Walking in, you see lots of mismatched furniture and even the bowls and cups are mismatched but it's SO CUTE. It has a hipster vibe and it's actually quite large inside. 

Our service was adequate. She served us in a nice and timely manner but nothing outstanding. We each tried something different; I chose the teriyaki chicken rice bowl and was sooo tempted to get the takkoyaki but I resisted because I wanted ice cream after. The bowl was $8.50. While the food was good, my complaint is that the portion was very very small. At a restaurant you never want to think \"I could have made this at home for cheaper\" but I thought that. It was not enough for this hungry soul. 

I also tried out the D4 ice cream which the name has escaped my mind, but I actually really enjoyed it. I got the twist of matcha and taro ice cream and it came with a kit Kat, tapioca, the bubbles that pop in your mouth, a few marshmallows, and etc. The taro is very smooth and I really liked it. 

I give this place 3.5 stars. I would not come again for the rice bowls, but I will come again for the ice cream."}
{"text":"Just came here for lunch on a Wednesday, after not knowing what to eat and stumble upon this store. Very easy to read menu, the atmosphere just brings me back to kindergarden... with waitress dressing up like teacher... or is it only me thinking like that?! I order spicy Pork ramen instantly regretting not because of quality but my wife order what I want: tempura shrimp curry rice. There's a lot of choices, just seeing how it really is will probably take couple more trips. the service is really slow, unlike the other reviews said it was 5min. It's a Wednesday and not too busy. There are 3 waiters but only one waitress delivering food and going around. Food was okay, Pork slice was probably the leanest cut I ever seen in Pork ramen. I can't help myself to think that something is amiss. Overall ok food, price ok, long wait parking."}
{"text":"I was craving some Japanese don and Matcha soft serve on Monday, so I decided to drop by. Surprisingly, we went at the right time (around 3pm) because they had their Afternoon Tea specials. The tea set menu comes with a choice of a drink, an appetizer and an entree for only $5.99! 

FOOD: 4 stars 
For the apps, we all got the 3 pcs. takoyaki, and it was honestly pretty good considering the fact that Toronto doesn't have really great Takoyaki balls. 

For the entree, I tried the Buta Mayo rice & my friends tried the Gyu rice and the Tempura Rice. All three included a few pieces of Edamame, Ginger and Cantaloupe on the side. Although their portions are smaller than what you would get originally, I found the meal to be pretty satisfying after finishing up the whole meal. However, it was pretty frustrating because they waited until the whole order is ready before serving it. Thus, I found the entree itself to be a little cold. However, we all loved our meals! 

SERVICE: 2.5 stars 
The service was really slow, with only one server working at the time. We wanted to get the soft serve, but we were waiting for approx 15 minutes and she didn't even bother putting in our order yet! 

AMBIENCE: 4 stars 
Such a cute place! It kind of gives a hipster, Korean cafe vibe! 

Overall:
A decent place to eat during their afternoon tea set!"}
{"text":"Despite the 2 stars, it's really more like a 2.5. The hype for this restaurant is really nothing more than a hype. I came by for dinner with my sister, who is a big fan of donburis. She ordered the spicy buta mayo don and I, the unagi don. We also got a side of takoyaki and each an iced matcha milk tea.

Our milk teas were just so-so. I asked for less ice and the waitress misheard me and wrote down my order wrong and gave me a less sweet order. That's not the only order she got wrong. I also asked for no ginger in my takoyaki which there was still ginger when it got delivered. They even said they don't put ginger in their takoyaki after I made sure to tell them specifically not to put any as I can't have any.

Both our meals came with a miso soup and right off the bat we noticed the portions were smaller than what we were used to. My sister's pork don was apparently more of mayo and rice than any pork flavour, and according to her, \"very tasteless and mediocre (the spice wasn't actually spicy at all)\" and not worth $10. My unagi don was all right but considering how easy it is to make it, you really can't go wrong with it. There wasn't anything special or eye popping worthy. 

Service was slow, it takes way too long for someone to come tend to you and it's like they don't look at you at all even with your hand raised for a long duration of time. 

Although bill came up to around $35, I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Heavy heart giving this rating since the food was great overall and so was the service. However because I made a rule saying if the restaurant uses noticeable amount of MSG I will only give the business a maximum of three stars. 

The restaurant is on the east side facing the street with the cluster of restaurants so it's hard to find if you're not familiar with the plaza layout. We almost missed it actually. 

We started with the wasamayo crispy takoyaki. This is clearly one of my top takoyaki I have eaten. The very crispy skin and overall presentation of the dish were a delight. I would say this is much better than the big jumbo sized ones I had in the Philippines. 

I ordered a hot matcha milk tea and my wife got the hot chocolate with marshmallows. The hot chocolate wasn't much to write about. However, the matcha milk tea COMES WITH MARSHMALLOWS. It tasted pretty refreshing with no icky thickening of the saliva feeling. 

The main meal I had was Gyudon. It satisfies the definition that it should be a meal in a bowl. They had a peculiar mix in that they added avocados, Apple slices and pickled ginger. Honestly I would be satisfied with it, but...

It came with miso soup. That is just way too much food at this point. Shortly after I drank the soup I had developed  the MSG numbness. I am particularly blaming that soup in order to give this place another chance so I can give it a five star rating it really deserves."}
{"text":"I loved Moji and it has become my go to place when I'm indecisive on where to go for dinner. The wait is never too long and the service is excellent. The menu selection isn't the largest and it's mostly rice based. The food is seasoned well and the meat is just juicy enough! I found it a little weird that the warm rice based dishes were topped with slices of cantaloupe. In any case, the food is good, the portions are big and definitely a good value."}
{"text":"After seeing my friend's pictures of their ice cream, I thought to try it out. 

They had very limited selection in soft serve - they only feature two flavours every so often, this month, it is taro and durian... I ordered the taro soft serve in a cup, which was about $3.5 and my friend ordered the Oreo taro soft serve in a cup, which was about $4.5. The portions are relatively small, but nothing more to complain about. 

I will definitely be back to try their food menu, it looked and smelt delicious!"}
{"text":"I went back with my mom just last week and found the udon too salty. The server (perhaps manager?) was super friendly and informed us of the specials (getting a drink cheaper when added to a meal) and the $5 ramen for Father's Day weekend."}
{"text":"?order ?????????????????????????????D?
????????????????"}
{"text":"This is a new japanese restaurant which replaced the old Nak Won, I came across this when we drove by so we decided to give it a try. They offer donburi, few appetizer, and latte or tea. Also, they have matcha soft-serve ice cream too!!! The restaurant is very spacious with some cute decoration by the windows, and chairs with different design as well. For the food, at first I ordered Chicken Karage Donburi, and my husband ordered spicy beef donburi. The order took about 10 mins, when it came I was too hungry and did not really look at my food so I had a bite, then I realize the server got my order wrong and gave me the Teriyaki Chicken Don instead. She apologized and asked if I wanted to switch, but I thought I have already started it so I said it was fine. The portion was generous, it came with 3 slices of apples, an egg, ginger and miso soup. The chicken and onion was very tasty, onion was surprisingly good, even I don't like onion but I finished all of them. At the end, they gave you a coupon of free matcha ice cream. so I would come back for sure!!"}
