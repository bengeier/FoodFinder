{"text":"weak overall... visionless in this city of many coffee offerings."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for awhile (the signage outside is a bit of an eyesore BUT it does catch your attention).  The barista was friendly and patient while I was waffling between getting my usual latte and flat white.  Decided to get a flat white since it's not on many espresso menus.  It was on par with the one I had at Te Aro so yes, it was lovely, velvety and rich.  I think it has pushed me over to preferring it over lattes as it's a bit stronger.  There's ample seating in the back, a small couch area across the barista bar in the middle and a few small tables that line up from the couch area to the door. I was able to score a couch and caught up on some reading though was distracted by their shelve of merchandise.  I'll have to come back and check out their back patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Independent roaster and cafe - and they do both very well. Open air style with typical espresso and the usual selection of baked goods.  Fair trade, organic, eco-friendly, free wifi, ample seating, electrical outlets, knowledgeable and amicable baristas, all add up to a down-to-earth guilt-free cafe experience.  If I lived on the west side of town I would be a regular."}
{"text":"The five stars here isn't so much a \"OH MY GOD THIS PLACE IS SO AMAZING I'M MOVING IN UPSTAIRS\" as it is a more subdued \"I've never been disappointed, and they do everything that I would expect them to.\"  They roast on site, and actually do it well, nine times out of ten the barista is not only capable but also extremely friendly, and they don't rely on a spectacularly designed space to get people through the door (i.e. the space feels kind of organic and almost accidental, unlike the fake \"shabby-chic\" sort of look that proliferates Toronto's west-end cafes)  It's somewhere that I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for, but if I'm passing by, I usually stop in."}
{"text":"Popped in here after getting my hair done. I actually just needed to get out of the rain while I searched Google Maps for the best way to get home, but I thought that since I was mooching off of their toasty warm and dry atmosphere, I couldn't not order anything.   I picked up a chai latte from the sweet looking barista and actually ended up asking her where to get the street car from. She was really kind and told me where to go before making up my drink. Another asian girl actually rang up my order on the till while the other girl was prepping my drink. She left me to my own devices juuuuuust long enough for me to decide I wanted a chocolate chip cookie too. I don't know what kind of chocolate chip cookie it was, but it was FAB. It tasted like an oatmeal cookie with chocolate chips? Except maybe a little less dense than full on oatmeal? I have no idea. I just know it was amazing!  They lose one star because my drink wasn't *quite* hot enough (and I'm not allowed take away just half a star) but other than that, it was lovely. :)"}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto, I had a couple of hours to kill before meeting a friend for dinner at Pho Tien Thanh around the corner. I used Google street view to see what was nearby, and this was the first coffee place I found. The Yelp reviews were good, so I settled on T.A.N. Coffee as the place I'd go to read for four or so hours.  And a good choice it was. I was too full from lunch to try any of the tempting-looking baked goods, but the Gunpowder Peppermint tea I had was lovely and there was a generous amount for my $2. The music was good without being too distracting -- mostly swingin' jazz and Simon and Garfunkel. The bathrooms were clean and fun. There was a nice mix of friends chatting and folks on their laptops. There's free WiFi. In other words, it was a solid 4-star coffee shop.   What I had failed to notice in my initial research, however, was that T.A.N. closes at 7pm. I was meeting my friend at 8pm. This is where the 5th star comes in. A little before 7, I realized that almost everyone had gone and they were starting to clean up. Ack! Not only did I not know where else to go in the neighborhood, but it was snowing. When I brought up my glass to the counter, I mentioned to the barista that I wasn't having dinner until 8pm and wasn't sure where to go. She smiled and assured me that they usually didn't finish cleaning up until then, and I was welcome to stay. I did so, and she and the other barista chatted with me and made me feel very welcome and not an imposition at all. Their kindness and friendliness make this a 5-star cafe. If I lived in Toronto, I'd want T.A.N. to be my local coffee shop, because if this is how they treat random strangers, regulars must really have it good!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today en route to Parlour Salon. Had a Flat White. I had no idea what it was, but the woman before me ordered it and it looked nice... I asked the barista what it is and he pleasantly explained how it's two shots of espresso with wet foamy milk. He went in to great detail about how the milk had a certain consistency- you could tell he really knew his stuff- but the great thing is that he wasn't full of attitude- he was really just sharing what he knows so well.  THEN I sipped the Flat White. WOW, sweet caramelly espresso hit my lips, followed by frothy and velvety milk.  Divine.  Oh and I had a pumpkin muffin- delicious too! Freshly baked for sure, not oily, not underbaked and not too sweet.  If I hadn't had to get to my hair appointment, I'd would have stayed longer and had another drink 'experience'  :-)  I didn't explore but there was a sign for the garden patio at the back... something to explore on my next trip there!"}
{"text":"This is one of my local cafes, although not one I use much. Not as much as I should. The coffee is good, and when we went in there today there was some latte art on top of the latte. There really isn't as much latte art in Toronto as there should be.  I've used the free wifi there and it's good. It's what a place like this should have.  The owners are often serving here, and you always feel welcome. It's not a snooty cafe (snooty for their coffee, that is) but it's got some great coffee, and they are often roasting it themselves on their own roaster.  I'd recommend if you need a cafe in the 'hood."}
{"text":"Great beans + roasted weekly + skilled barista = great cortado.  The baked goods looked great too, but I wasn't crazy about the vibe here.  The current colour (they seem to change it often - see photos) is a lime green that wasn't particularly warm or inviting.  It wouldn't stop me from going back, however, as it's likely to be a different colour next time."}
{"text":"There is so much to like about T.A.N. coffee. First of all there is the attraction of the fact they roast their Fair Trade coffee beans right on premise. This means there is a very good likelihood you'll get a very fresh and tasty cup of coffee, which I can attest to. The establishment is very relaxed and cozy with 91.1 Jazz FM playing softly in the background. There is also plenty enough room in the cafe to relax by yourself or meet up with a few friends.  Other highlights include the ability to buy fresh roasted coffee from a number of Latin American countries as well as cocoa for those nights when a cup of hot chocolate is your buffer from those long, cold winter days and nights. If your looking for a little something to munch on they do have decent croissants as well as muffins from Circles & Squares bakery.  Of note, T.A.N. supports non-profit organizations through donations and fund raising. They are also very much into educating people on the value of Free Trade coffee.   What else can I say? How about a once a week open mic night for local musicians? I think they have free WiFi too. Yep, there is a lot to like about T.A.N. and I can assuredly recommend the place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I stopped by here while waiting for a friend to get her hair done at Parlour (on the recommendation of miss Laura T.!).  It's a great little spot near Queen W and Ossington for an organic, fair trade coffee.  As part of the passport I treated myself to a rooibos latte with a hint of vanilla, it was a nice change from the sweeter chai latte.  The place a cosy laid back vibe and it seems like a lot of neighbourhood regulars drop by - always a good sign."}
{"text":"I had a really great experience at T.A.N.  and would recommend a visit here before you head to Parlour on Ossington for a haircut!  I had the perfect chai latte and a lovely chat with the adorable barista (literally adorable - personality AND killer smile)  They had lots of tasty treats to munch on with your coffee and comfortable couches, chairs and bench seats with tables. It feels really relaxed and tucked away and almost homey. Loved it."}
{"text":"How could such a lovely cafe be so quiet on a Saturday afternoon? That's just criminal, that is. My lovely barista B-man (let's face it, I've forgotten his name but I know it started with B) was happy to see my Indie Coffee Passport and we chatted about some of the stops on there while he got my order ready.  I was very pleased with my soy latte - a dark, rich flavour, nice and smooth with very little bitterness. I can tell you it went down smashingly with my Sweets from the Earth chocolate chip cookie. (T.A.N have a few other Sweets offerings as well as bagels, muffins and other light snacks too.)  The cafe itself is comfy - a mix of bench seating, tables and even a couch toward the back. A terrific atmosphere to kick back with a coffee & crossword. The on-premises coffee roaster looms like a shiny glorious monster at the front of the cafe, and you'll find big sacks of coffee beans on your way toward the back.   T.A.N have a nice environmental  focus too, using green-friendly takeaway cups and selling 'keep cups' for those who want to take re-use to the highest level. It seems like a lot of people come in to take away just the beans themselves, however.  Given the friendly service, lovely coffee and genuine atmosphere of TAN, my stop using the Indie Coffee Passport has won me over, and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Part of the Indie coffee passport 2011. This is the 2nd branch of the cafe. I think the location is more accessible by public transport as you its right on the main queen street drag. The setup is functional and simple. Free WiFi which is always good. Now for the drink I ordered my cappuccino with the sweetener. The serving is on the smaller side. Latte art is OK. The espresso itself was mellow but had nice aroma. Good iteration for the drink and I think it is better than the other branch. 3.5 stars for the drink 2 stars for the setup. I wouldn't mind coming here if I am in this area. Tried the cortado on the second visit as per the recommendation of a fellow Yelper. I would stick with cappuccino as even though the latter art good the taste wasn't. I think the either the machine was off as the espresso shot was scalding hot and threw off the taste. 2 Star for the Cortado."}
{"text":"It's a decent indie coffee shop. Honestly though, nothing special. I did appreciate the fact that on the couches on the far right there is plug for me to recharge my phone but aside from that, this place is no different then a ton of nearby cafes. The interior is nothing special except form perhaps serviceable.   It is really an okay place but I would not try to make a point to come here. While I would make a point to go to places like Holy Oak Cafe or Tequila Bookworm just because they try to be so much more.   It is fair to say that T.A.N and the sums its parts is far more interesting than just this part."}
{"text":"I am sitting here RIGHT NOW why do I love reviewing placewhile i'm still in them?    ok, super cozy place.  long room full of a 20s/30s crowd studying.  music is good without being distractingly good. nice selelection of loose leaf teas.  dessert case a.ok.  and, of course, free wifi. there are only plugs on the front and end of the room, but plenty to keep a combination of laptop zombies and people actually socializing.  UPDATE: this place has a cute little lounge int he back if you don't mind sitting near the washroom and I heard in the summer it has a kickass patio.  woot."}
{"text":"a very cute cafe with comfy benches covered with pillows. Yay I love pillows in cafes=)  also friendly barista.  and they had some crazy looking coffee making machine (that looked more like a locomotive=))   oh the desserts are yummy (sea salt brownie here was my second this week (first being in Green Beanery) and it was sooooooo gooooood!) and the variety of drinks is great!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the short time I spent at T.A.N, the exterior does not do justice to the quiet and spacious interior. The staff member there was very easy going and friendly, we chatted a bit about the indie coffee passport while she was making my drink amongst other topics, and commended me on my choice of the \"cashew cookie\" which turned out to be amazing and like she said, I will never look at a peanut butter cookie the same after having tried that. (I even left a quick tip about that! Which I hardly seem to do).   The menu was pretty typical I say and it did not seem to be expensive at all, I don't believe any item cost more than $4.50 apart from the $5 sandwiches I believe? I got myself a Chai Latte and saw they used Indian \"Masala Chai\" tea leaves which perked my interest. My drink was good, I should have sub'd for soy milk and maybe a bit of vanilla like I usually do but meh...I doubt I would try it again, I would much prefer a coffee drink next time.   Like @Isabella mentions, it does give off a Starbucks vibe but for me it was because of the overall seating arrangement of the place (although it was more like Second Cup to me), but it's definitely more comfortable than Starbucks seating.   It's not the cutest establishment I've ventured in to, but it was pretty late in the day when I arrived and it was very quiet and relaxing. Exactly what I was hoping for and would very much like to come back in the summer for their garden patio!"}
{"text":"Okay, this is where I'll use one of the most popular review statements ever on Yelp.  \"I wanted to love this place.\"  No, I didn't copy and paste that.  It's just a saying that you'll never hear me SPEAK but the meaning works well in this instance.  Cappuccino was full of Crema with nice Steam Milk Froth consistency, but maybe just maybe the finish had a bit Sour note that personally didn't work for me as I browsed for the Watering Hole canister that was not available here.  Comes oh so close to some of my more favourites.  (-0.5 *Star*)  TAN does offer a few distinct seating areas that allows each Patron to select their preference as we chose to seat facing the Roaster.  There was this guy that kept coming in and out and walking around the outside.  Maybe he was waiting for the place across from TAN to finish construction?  Overall, TAN Coffee has been 3.5'd"}
{"text":"Among all the hipster cafés on Queen St W, this little place stands out out. First and most obvious, this place is not going through \"hipsterfication,\" they roast their own coffee (perfect, not over roasted like many others), and have amazing cookies.  Free wifi internet access is available. If you're in the area, give it a try."}
{"text":"I went here for a morning beverage. I was surprised at the price of a regular coffee, I can recall the exact amount but closer to $3. I started to get worried I had entered one of those casual looking-but really expensive type of places. However, the rest of the menu was decently priced. I ended up with a chai latte for $4 (thats more affordable than most places I go).   The latte was made with a tea bag and milk. I mention this because other places will use a pre-made power/liquid flavour base. (doesn't taste or look very authentic). So I was impressed with what seemed to be a more authentic way to make tea latte's. It was unsweetened, which I liked and disliked. I liked that it wasnt sugary sweet, overbearing, but I also found it a bit tricky to add the sugar myself, as it just stuck to the yummy latte foam on top, instead of mixing in below.   The shop itself was not busy. Service was friendly, if not on the slow side. They have a selection of tasty looking treats, tarts, cheesecake, cream puffs, all within $4 or less. There appeared to be wi-fi although I did not ask if it was free. There was lots of available seating, and a comfortable atmosphere. I would definitely come back here to chill or study."}
{"text":"Oh, the smell of beans roasting in the morning. How could it not awaken my mad love for coffee shops.   Coffee shops with free wi-fi (password: community), a garden patio and the sweetest owner, that is. Needless to say, camping out for some work time is a necessity here! Only lament - where's the raw sugar source? And a $1 charge for using visa? Perhaps that's a Torontonian thing I need to get used to."}
{"text":"Drink I ordered a large mocha here and while it wasn't the best I've had (read: Green Beanery), it was smooth and bold and all that I expect out of one. It was also made very conscientiously by the barista.   Menu They offer a pretty nice selection of brownies, muffins and organic energy bars. A definite cut above your usual Starbucks fare, and I don't think I'd be scrounging around for a local pizza joint nearby.   Service Amazing service, really. On my visit the barista was friendly, charming and engaging. The staff seems to be very comfortable and inviting.  Ambiance This place is so damn laid-back, it makes for a perfect place to lounge around with a drink and a good book. The further back of the cafe you travel, the cozier it gets.  Study/Work friendly? Yes."}
{"text":"** 3.5 Stars **  Good coffee (Free Trade), friendly staff (owner?) and having local regulars who constantly drop in for their coffee usually points to a great coffee shop, however there were some few points that I was a bit disappointed with.   Their desserts were a bit \"meh\" in terms of the choices and types of desserts available. Although they did have a selection for the vegans as well so they tried to cater to everyone.  In terms of being cozy as per Melissa F's review, I'm not so sure. The furniture seemed cheap and the bench I was sitting on felt like it was going to break off from the wall everything I was leaning forward! Plus no padding on seating in a coffee shop instantly kills any \"cozy\" possibility.  Free WiFi was a good plus but personally I couldn't stay in here for more an hour or two."}
{"text":"Only my luck: I am served hot chocolate on a lip-stained mug! I immediately showed it was dirty & the barista made me another cup. That was good service. He used 1/2 water & 1/2 milk - not tasty. But I got to listen to a free folk concert by 2 cute, young buskers!"}
{"text":"I spent about ten minutes playing with a few products they were selling.  Coffee cups to go, mugs to go and an interesting coffee maker. I decided  not to buy any of their offerings but I was almost swayed to buy something I didn't need just because I hadn't seen it before.  Yeah, I am one of those.  I have significantly reduced that habit since I moved to Toronto! Thank goodness.  Anyone who loves coffee is to some degree a coffee snob. I mean, you can't ingest that much caffeine and not have a point of view.  I have heard so much about this place. Pointed this direction by someone that works there and folks from the neighborhood.  I'll say this, some have said it's not a hipster location but I'm afraid they are marching in.  If something is good, they will come.  It has all the elements: wifi, fair trade,patio and non corporate.  All this being said, I cannot say it is the best coffee I have had in the city.  I would go back and try another but it still falls behind Manic Coffee and Balzac's.     Roasting coffee bean in house is awesome but the outcome still has to tickle my coffee palette."}
{"text":"Great coffee, very chill vibe. The staff is friendly. They roast the coffee on site and it comes through in the freshness of the brew! Yummy."}
{"text":"#indiecoffeepassport stop #3  It was late Saturday afternoon and the sun had set. I was getting cold on my walk home and the growl in my stomach was getting louder. My caffeine fix from Mascot's had long worn off and with plans on my evening's agenda, I needed sustenance to stay awake. I walked past TAN café and looked through the windows condensed with the warmth of brewed coffee and roasting of beans. Yep, I decided that I would have more caffeine and sugar in my day's diet before dinner. But more importantly, I would acquire another stamp on my Indie Coffee Passport.   For a late weekend afternoon, there was plenty of seating options and about 8 people were scattered in different spots. The comfy seats were taken and I sat on the cushioned pew along one of the walls. It was fairly comfortable and I stayed for a while reading my book.   I ordered a regular coffee which was okay. TAN roasts their own beans, but I didn't find my particular cup of coffee to be impressive. It was sort of bland and not strong enough for my liking. I should've ordered an Americano. I did love their chewy, sugary pecan caramel bar. It helped induce a sudden sugar and caffeine buzz afterward that I didn't love so much. Thankfully, the buzz wore off on my walk home in time for a proper meal.   It's nice to know that TAN is here and that it's a good spot to come to and do some work. I'd love to check out the patio when it's warmer."}
{"text":"After walking past this quiet cafe several times on the way to work, finally stepped in this morning for a latte.   Menu - all your standard espresso drinks, coffee, and loose leaf teas + muffins and bagels. My latte was okay/good, but at $4 for a regular, kinda pricey. They do have stamp cards if you come often enough.  Ambiance - relaxed and haphazard, like sitting in a friend's basement. Local art on display, mismatched furniture, and coffee tables with newspapers and Wallpaper back issues.   Music - sounded like CHUM FM or something.   Service - this place never seems very busy, so service is unhurried and thoughtful."}
{"text":"I ordered a London Fog with Soy Milk. It costed me a million bucks and it wasn't even that special. The barista barely looked at me and almost made my London Fog with regular milk (I had to ask again for soy).  They have sea salt caramel brownies. I didn't have them, but now I have a reason to come back to this place.   Now that I'm writing this, he REALLY looked like Moss from the IT Crowd. Maybe I'll appear in a blooper?"}
{"text":"I dig the atmosphere here! And of course the coffee is good. (that's the most important, right??)   Also - FREE Wifi!!  Caramel sea salt brownie - yum yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"VIBE  Nothing special here. Everything is a bit bland and the door is open so I'm a bit cold (yes, I'm a grumpy old woman). Staff is nice and a good worker. You may or may not see a homeless man pop in about two or three times while you're here. So yes, the atmosphere is to be desired.   The church pews are not really sturdy so anytime anyone moves you feel it. Tables are minimal for internetting.   They DO  have a garden patio in the back. Very interesting.   Probably more of a take your coffee and go (though there are lots of seats here).   I DRANK London fog. Way too sweet. Not too my liking.  They have smoothies and other coffees and lattes on hand. This is my first time here so I can't comment on anything else.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Not getitng my tan here anytime soon but for available cafes offering internet access and an outlet? Yes please!"}
{"text":"C O F F E E   P A S S P O R T  F I N A L   S T O P  (#24)     Drink: Vanilla Cream Latte  Atmosphere:     It feels like a Starbucks here. The girl behind the counter saw my passport and was suprised saying she's never seen a complete one, ha. She was nice though. Inside, it's pretty small, but cozy with a long bench and some pillows. Towards the back is a couch and a feel sofa chairs.   My drink was so-so. Since this place was my last stop, I decided to try something new y'know? Y'no. Wrong choice. LOL. Oh well. I didn't like it 'cause simply the taste of it bothered me. I should have stuck with Soy Chai. Somehow I imagined 'vanilla cream' to be more aromatic and less creamy tasting.   Overall:    Nothing new really, but I should try out their other drinks 'cause apparently this is supposed to be one of the top coffee shops in Toronto!  W R A P    U P:  This is my LAST STOP for my coffee passport. I hope you guys enjoyed my reviews and whenever I go back, I will definately update everyone.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"I was wrong. I feel terrible to have jumped to conclusions. I went back to T.A.N. and had the most wonderful conversation with the barrista while she made my delicious decaf latte, it was creamy and full-bodied and somehow even the decaf espresso shone through the milk. Hurray!"}
{"text":"COFFEE PASSPORT:  Here's my ranking for Soy latte so far: 1. Intelligentisia, Sam James 2. TAN 3. Crema"}
{"text":"T.A.N.  is the first stop of our Niagara Neighbourhood crawl. First coffee of the day is always A-OK!!  Thie location little out of the way from all the hassle of the more busy shopping area east of it.   I found the interior of TAN quiet and rustic. Love the patio at the back and some of the sofas and armchairs in the front... or if you don't want to be lounging around, you can always put your laptop and surf away in one of the cafe tables.   The cappuccino I found is quite good. Roast is a little strong but good to really wake me up and jump started my day! The \"Heart\" shaped latte art is a nice touch.  BTW if you want to feel good about spending your money ethically, T.A.N.'s Free trade coffee may make you feel good about yourself.  Free WIFI and Indie Coffee Passport participant makes T.A.N A-OK experience!"}
{"text":"If I had to guess, I'd assume that T.A.N. stands for Tarry and Natter, but that would be cloyingly British. I stopped in for a quick americano and ended up chatting with the friendly barista, Nicki*, for over an hour. Our conversation, ranging from Toronto politics to the nuances of \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" was an excellent way to start the day.  T.A.N. (The Alternative Network) is located on Queen Street West  across from CAMH. All the coffee is fair trade, organic, and roasted in house. They also offer desserts and sandwiches, Larabars(!), Boylans soda and something called Black River Nectar, a locally sourced fruit juice from Mississauga.  There is plenty of seating, and while I wouldn't call it cozy, it's quite charming and I'd definitely spend a few hours here. Which I have.  Obligatory Title Pun: Put on some lotion, 'cause we're going to TAN.  Menu Readability: I'd like to point out here that I hate their logo. Quel désastre!  Need to mention: The washrooms are maybe my favourite part. I won't spoil the surprise, check 'em out!  What this place teaches me about myself: I could probably spend a whole weekend discussing the complex relationship between Frank and Charlie.    __________________ * Or it could be \"Nikki\", but I hate this spelling and I wanted to err on the side of my personal taste."}
{"text":"Great jazz playing in the background.  The barista was quite helpful, guiding us gently through the menu & how many doses of espresso were REALLY necessary.  The mocha I had was all right but a little bitter for my personal preference.  He gave us to-go cups even though we had clearly set up winter camp - better safe than sorry, though!  There was an odd wandering lady who was consistently wandering in & out, stealing reading material from around the place - checking her watch & then repeating which broke the mood a little.  Perfect place for brainstorming on a Monday holiday."}
