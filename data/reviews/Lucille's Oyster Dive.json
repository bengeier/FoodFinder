{"text":"Informal Seafood themed restaurant. Crowded and loud. Go with friends, not for an intimate meal. Great fish tacos, fried calamari and \"Asian\" salmon tartare. Waiters push you out a bit to quickly given the prices."}
{"text":"Two dozen oysters were so delicious we ordered a half dozen more. The lobster rolls are decadent and enough for 2 people to split (especially of you've just shared 30 oysters). The bourbon/grapefruit cocktail is divine-- not too sweet, not too strong. Finally, the decor is after my heart. The mermaid statue in the corner seals it. Go!"}
{"text":"Completely and utterly unacceptable dining experiences here.
The lobster rolls are soggy and don't taste fresh at all. We were charged 59$ for a ceasar salad with a bit of feta and pieces of tasteless octopus. 
This summer, we decided to give this Lucille's location another try. Upon arrival, we were greeted by an incompetent hostess, mumbling under her breath. It was a warm summer evening so we decided to eat on the terasse. After a 10 minute wait for out table (which is ridiculous considering the restaurant was empty), we were finally seated. As we were sitting down, the waitress told us we couldn't eat here because we had a quiet 4 pound puppy in his carrier. This has never happened to me, we are frequent diners in some of the most beautiful and amazing restaurants in Montreal and have never encoutered such a situation, especially on a terasse. 
If you're looking for a quality dining experience and and friendly staff, definitely do not even consider Lucille's on Monkland."}
{"text":"Oysters - 5/5 - Truly amazing every time
Lobster Rolls - 4.5/5 - Consistent every time and delicious tender lobster

I have been to Lucille's about 5 times, and each an every time it has been delicious. Other than it tends to get loud, this place is highly recommended if you want great oysters."}
{"text":"Place is great... Not fancy but the oysters and seafood were top notch and very fresh. Sat at the bar and staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. 
Oysters were very crisp and clearly very fresh, octopus was some of the best I've ever had (including Greece, Italy, Spain...) a bit pricey but worth it. 
Steamers in the cream garlic sauce is also a must. Civeche is pretty unique and def worth a try. 
Did not have the lobster rolls but they looked awesome. 
Extra points for the Harley gas tanks."}
{"text":"Small space and you are practically eating with strangers. Food is fresh. Service depends on who you g"}
{"text":"Took my brother out here for his birthday. We were 3 people and we had heard this place had amazing seafood. As appetizers,  I treated myself to a seafood ceasar which had a snow crab leg, a prawn, 1 raw oyster an a fresh clam . The ceasar was awesome 
Every item we ordered was actually delicious. We shared 3 appys and 2 mains. Was a bit excessive and slightly expensive  (270 for the 3 of us ) but the quality was there. 
My favorites were the seared tuna tartar, the calamari and the surf n turf.
The fish tacos were good but not mind blowing. 
I'd recommend this resto to anyone  (for a special occasion on account of the cost)"}
{"text":"The worst possible experience ever. 
First, We were told there was a 10 to 20 minutes wait. After not even 10 mins we got a table. Second, We had just been seated when the hostess asked us to move because another couple with a baby needed the table. The couple had been waiting next to us and had requested for a table outside and our table was inside. We thought the hostess request was odd but we agreed to accommodate the couple with the baby and the stroller. 
Finally, the couple did not like the table and decided to wait for a table outside. So, we asked the hostess to get that table back. The Hostess refused arguing that the table was for four and we could not have it. However, it was the exact same table we had been given a few minutes before. When asked again the reason why we could not have the tabel we had just been asked to give the couple and child, the hostess said she was too busy and needed the table. As if we we were not going to consume anything. I wonder what the hell she thought we were doing in the restaurant. But the best when we asked to speak to the manager. The hostess literally ran to the manager and told her the situation. We were standing right behind her and when I asked if we could talk outside because it was to noisy inside, the manager said she could not talk to me right now because she had to go check on her tables outside. she came back after a few minutes saying that we could not seat outside but that she would be happy to give us a table inside. THE NERVE!!!! we never asked for a table outside, we always wanted to seat inside at the initial table that we had been seated. The manager was oblivious to whatever happened and with that we left. This is the worst place in Montreal. A place that does not even have a manager that would take the time to listen is not worth at all. If the food is good or bad it does not matter the hostess and management are rude and inconsiderate. I will never go back to that place and suggest you do not go either. Places that have staff such as these two ladies are destine to go down the drain."}
{"text":"i tried the salmon tartare for 18$ and honestly i've had better. it was served on that red and white plastic hot dog  paper wich turned me off plus they put a big chunk of lettuce wich looked like it came right out of the garden. so for me is a 0 for the presentation of the salmon tartare and a 2/5 on the taste. then i had the octopus as my main dish and nope! 2.5/5 on the taste. it was not flavory enough for me. it almost didn't taste like nothing. i might go back just to try the lobster rolls but that will be the last chance i'll give this spot. as for the drinks i had a cocktail and loved it 5/5 !! it was based of gin"}
{"text":"Loved everything! Great atmosphere, drinks, seafood (try the fried calamari), and service!"}
{"text":"Not much on the menu. Staff was clueless and drinks tasteless. Seems they mainly use girls with too much make-up, tight dresses and high heels (that most can't walk with properly) to draw in customers. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Juste wow! Évidamment tous le monde aime les \"lobster rolls\", mais ceux du Lucille's sont incomparable dans le coin de NDG. Les côtes levées fumées dans leur fumoir sont tendres et savoureuses. Le prix était raisonnable, ils suivent le prix du marché.. Ma copine à prise les fruits de mer grillés cuits à la perfection! Rien à dire, la pièvre était parfaitement cuite, tendre, gouteuse... Wow! 

Le service était aussi impeccable, les serveuses vous metes à l'aisse et notre commande est arrivée dans un délai plus que convenable. Juste assez rapide pour sastifaire notre faim et pas trop pour avoir le temps de passé une soirée en bonne compagnie:)"}
{"text":"I've lived quite near this place for a few years now but never was tempted to go in until recently... I think I may have had one of my best meals ever in Montreal. We had a salmon tartare, fish tacos and lobster rolls. All of it was PERFECTLY prepared and tasted amazingly fresh and flavorful. Service was excellent as well. Only wish it was more affordable..."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food is great.  Very fresh seafood, lobster roll, amazing oyster selection.  Also don't forget the aged beef!! The staff is extremely friendly and incredible looking.  We took our kids and they were very accommodating and made us feel comfortable.

We have been here twice on vacation and have loved it both times.  If you enjoy good oysters in a hip but casual atmosphere you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Great service
Knowledgeable and friendly staff
Awesome seafood joint.
Incredibly busy, so be prepared to wait.


A great big lil gem.
Unlike our last cluster f@#$ of a seafood place this, place is JAMMIN.

Don't be fooled by the minimalist decor, you'll be overwhelmed.
Awesome food and cocktails.
Some of the best oysters I have ever had.
Everything we tried was amazing and hot.
Recommend."}
{"text":"Best lobster rolls in the city!!! Don't go on the weekend unless you are prepared to wait a long time for a table since its a small place. Very loud. If you want to enjoy go during the week."}
{"text":"My sister loves this place and told me it was very tasty but very noisy. I'm not a fan of places where I have to yell to be heard but I decided to go on a recent Friday night.

The place was already very busy when we arrived and it was only 6:30.
We decided to sit outside on the terrace, hoping it would be quieter then inside, it was covered due to the chilly weather but the heat lamps made it very cozy.

It's a very cute place with an American feel, blues playing on the speakers which I liked and personable staff.

I order the mini cheeseburgers with sweet potato fries, my sister order the same and her wife ordered the halibut.

My sliders consisted of 2 junior sized cheeseburgers, the meat was delicious and well seasoned, crisp lettuce and ripe tomato and a spicy sauce complimented it nicely. My first bite made me instantly say \"mmmmm\" 
I will definitely be coming back for these although there was quite enough tempting choices to try next time. My sweet potato fries were ok, the regular fries were better, crispy with some skins on them, nicely salted without a greasy taste.

The halibut was delicious, crispy edged, with a spicy kick to it.

We passed on desert because we were stuffed. I really liked this place and will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing, my bf and I fav spot for diner date... we get the beef tartar to share that is to die for, he gets the steak that he loves and I have oysters and the octopus, the greek salad that comes with the octopus is insane. The staff is always so sweet. We go there all the time and we will not stop any time soon."}
{"text":"By its reputation I was expecting way more than a noisy/rude staff/overpriced restaurant...

The noise level is pretty loud in the restaurant and I really could not hear the person who sit in front of me.
Don't get me wrong... the food is good -nothing crazy though, but unfortunately the experience is not: 

We started at the bar where we faced a rude bartender/waitress. She barely took care of us and was very cold... 
Oh well I decided to move on and asked the hostess if we could move to a table.
I put 2 stars because of the hostess being very nice!

After 2 caesar oyster shots, 2 beers and tacos as appetizers ($60 for 2...) we decided to go to another restaurant where we could relax and enjoy our night."}
{"text":"This is family friendly venue in Monkland village in NDG, a largely residential area of Montreal.  I must admit my bias: I like any restaurant with a good fresh seafood platter, and Lucille's doesn't disappoint. Also like their grilled seafood with calamari, octopus, shrimp and chorizo in piri piri broth. My toddler daughter loves the fish & chips and ice cream sandwich. The atmosphere is welcoming and staff nice (and friendly w kids). Dinner is about $75-80/person with 2  drinks."}
{"text":"Cynthia our server was great! Lobster Roll great! Noise level crazy. Having to yell to your dinner mates is exhausting."}
{"text":"There are many places around town that offer $1 oysters. This is not that place, and thank the heavens for that!
I ordered 6 oysters to start and was rewarded with a beautiful platter of oysters accompanied by tiny vials of vinegars and sauces that made the molluscs really sing.
As a second course I had the half octopus (quadropus?) which was yet another fantastic course. Perfectly cooked, beautifully presented and one of those dishes that sneaks back into your memory, beckoning you to revisit the flavours. So good!!
The missus had the clam chowder and enjoyed it, but she was disappointed by the fish and chips. She's a maritimer so her standard is pretty high. Mainlanders like me would probably think that it was fine.
Do over? Probably."}
{"text":"Don't believe the photo's of the lobster roll! That was the whole reason I went there with my family and we got two thin toasted buns with at least half of what is on the photos.  It was tasty but not worth the money.  Don't like to give bad reviews on resto's but if they were what we saw on here I would have been very satisfied...Sorry we feel duped. 
Clams were good but not great.  Fries were ok. Ribs were tasty and obviously were prepared with an authentic smoke style."}
{"text":"Impossible ribs, courteous service and great americana vibe. Lobster rolls and fish and chips also terrific!"}
{"text":"First off, Lucille's recently moved a block down from its original spot. Which I was honestly bummed about, cause I was kinda looking forward to experiencing a more divey, been-around-for-a-long-time kinda seafood joint, with ship steering wheels and fishing net decor, maybe some black-and-white photos of old bearded fishermen standing next to 7-foot tunas. But alas, no such luck. 

The new location, while definitely more modern, does try to maintain some of that old feel. Wood paneling, some Harley engines hanging up on the wall, a ship hull overlooking the larger part of the dining room. But the refrigerated glass room filled with dry-aging beef brings us back to 2017. 

I dropped by with my partner for a quick oyster fix. And honestly, that was all we could probably afford. Didn't realize how expensive it was going to be. Again, my visions of a seafood dive thwarted. That said, the oysters were amazing. Also managed to budget some fries and grilled veggies to balance out our meal, and both were quite exceptional for what they were. 

Would I come here again? Maybe for that octopus. But otherwise, I think the better value would be to split a box of oysters with a couple homies and shuck em ourselves. I never thought of oysters as a fine dining kind of cuisine anyways."}
{"text":"Pour des fruits de mer goûteux et un excellent service.

Un peu cher par contre"}
{"text":"There loaded Caesar is a must. Sweet potato friends were nice and crispy. Was a bit disappointed by the lobster rolls. They were cold and soggy but still tasted good. Was just expecting a bit more."}
{"text":"Location: In the heart of Monkland Village - 10-minute walk from Villa Maria subway. 

Service: The staff was super friendly and service was relatively quick. We sat at the bar so I'm not sure if table service was as quick. 

Food: Nothing to write home about. My date had oysters which she enjoyed, and the ribs as a main. She liked both the ribs and the side of fries, and said the sauce was super smokey, just the way she likes it. 

I ordered the beet root salad and sweet potato fries. The salad was good, but it wasn't spectacular. The goat cheese was more like cheddar, which was a disappointment. I expected crumbled goat cheese but instead got four slices of... well I assume it was goat cheese though as I said, it tasted like cheddar and had the same texture. The sweet potato fries were amazing and so were the regular fries. Nice and crispy on the outside. 

Ambiance: Way too f-ing loud. You can't hear yourself think in the place so for me, this is a fail. I really liked the space - I felt like I was in a bar on a beach somewhere. Would I go back? Probably not without earplugs."}
{"text":"Came to dine with my best friend from school last summer. Great caring service, ample portions, the steak is the best!"}
{"text":"Such a shame.  They used to be my favorite spot on Monkland but they seem more into appearances, high prices, and smaller portions at the new \"trendy\" location.  The lobster rolls used to have giant chunks and a whole claw. Tonight's was small cubes of lobster on top of soggy fries.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"The goat cheese starter was DELICIOUS, I would come back just for that. Fish n Chips were good but nothing special. My partner had the catch of the day, stripped sea bass, was very good but the tomatoes tasteless (which is a widespread problem nowadays). One complaint, It is very very loud!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Raisonnable. J'apprécie le menu avec tous les produits frais de la mer, je recommande le homard cocktail! Très bon repas, bonne ambiance. J'y retournerai sans hésiter!"}
{"text":"We've decided to go to this restaurant for Mother's Day because my mom is on diet and she enjoys seafood more then red meat. Since the restaurant is close to our neighborhood, we decided to give it a try. 

The oysters are really fresh but 21$ for a half dozen, I think I can find better deals elsewhere. 

The waitress suggested us to take the special of the day which was the grilled salmon with maple syrup glaze come with mixed salad on the side for 29$. This ended up to be my mom's favorite dish of the night. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the maple syrup just added a bit of caramelized sweetness onto the salmon.

My grilled octopus  was also amazing. It was cooked perfectly, tender but not tough. 

The only complain about this restaurant was the price and slow service. Though everything was good, it was way too overpriced. The grilled octopus was 34$ for half portion. In addition, the service was pretty slow. Since I read the reviews ahead and I was worried about the slow service, we got to restaurant by 5:45 to avoid the crowd and we still had to wait for about 40minutes for the dishes. 
Regardless the long waiting time, staffs are courteous and attentive, and I don't mind to wait a bit longer for quality food. Just be aware of waiting time if you decide to go since they don't take reservations ahead."}
{"text":"I grabbed a couple lobster rolls when they were parked at Osheaga. They were $20 each I believe, and I was able to use my Visa, which was nice! 

The rolls had a very good amount of lobster for a festival. They didn't skimp, so I felt it was worth the $10. Unfortunately they didn't use much seasoning. It definitely could have used some herbs or Old Bay or something. Still, I was satisfied, especially after two!"}
{"text":"I should add that these guys take Amex...

Also, go easy on the oysters if you're on a budget.  2 dozen cost me $80 tonight...I forget sometimes how much these tiny sea creatures cost! 

All in all a great spot though!"}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance with a fun crowd. 

It's not a place that you go for the food which is very average to meh, especially for what you can get in the city. 

The new location lends to much more room than the old...also doesn't have the same locals feel anymore. 

Not a must try."}
{"text":"Absolutely not worth the money. Is it alright? Yes, but just alright, and their prices do NOT justify the average quality. I cook better than that at home.  Plus the staff is truly strange looking and acting. Could have been the night we were there.  I won't be going back, so I'll never know."}
{"text":"Always great vibes and good times at Lucilles. However it is quite pricey so be sure to expect to dish out $100 for two if you're coming here for dinner"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Definitely try their special Bloody Caesar. If I have one negative thing to say about this place, it's that the tables are waaaay too close to each other, so if you're looking for an intimate conversation, Lucille's isn't the place to go."}
{"text":"Excellent food but very LOUD!!!!!!! Almost impossible to talk, which for me ruined the whole experience. That being said the food was top notch, beautifully presented and cooked to perfection. If I could go back knowing I could now hold a conversation without straining to hear every word I would go back, but otherwise I would have to pass."}
{"text":"I visit Lucille's regularly since it's in my neighborhood and last night I went with the entire family. We all had the fish and chips plus the oysters and fried calamari as starters. Everything was delicious! The fish was super fresh and deep fried in an amazing batter. The oysters were incredibly tasty as well. I always love everything I order here. Great service, great ambiance, and great food. The menu is pricey however so expect to drop a pretty penny on your dinner. Be prepared."}
{"text":"Great hip area with plenty of other restaurants to try. Nice relaxed ambience. Went on Monday night but hear it gets packed later in week and weekend.

Pros:
Steaks are 5 star and highly recommend to order
Oysters, fish tacos, and seafood delicious.
Loved the chocolate dessert with peanuts and caramel.
Great service and friendly staff.
Indoor and outdoor seating.

Cons:
No A/C so can get warm 
Parking may be tough in neighborhood depending on time of day"}
{"text":"Avis mitigé sur Lucille.
L'endroit est sympa et la bouffe est très bonne..... Mais le bruit et l'acoustique gâchent tout. Je ne prends vraiment pas de plaisir à devoir gueuler tout le repas et sortir avec une migraine..."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and loved it. Great food and waitress was great. We had to wait in line for a while before getting our table, although we booked beforehand, however the manager gave us shots on the house to compensate. Recommended!"}
{"text":"So I'll start by saying I'm happy to have a new place to go when visiting NDG friends. I like oysters a lot, and wine outside, and crazy Ceasar cocktails with crab legs poking out of them, and very friendly knowledgeable charming service. Lucille has all of these things in spades and these are great ways to win my heart. 

Uncrowded on a weekday 5a7, the patio bakes in the sun for the first hourish but then the shade hits and the spot becomes more comfortable, and the crowds come sauntering in. The inside is cool, literally and figuratively, though walking sort of through the kitchen to get to the confusingly signaged washrooms is perplexing and of dubious hygiene. 

My biggest gripe: the oysters were overpriced and 3/4 of the ones I tried had shell in them. I don't mind paying for perfect, but this wasn't it. I had a lovely time anyway, but man, nothing sticks in my craw like grit in an oyster."}
{"text":"Located in plush, Monkland Village, Lucille's Oyster Dive was an exciting and outstanding find for a perfect night. It's a dive alright- nothing flashy, energy was loud, I cracked up as loud as I wanted to and enjoyed every second.

Lucille's warm lighting made the evening calm and really fun. Baseball was playing and Bluegrass set the mood in Montréal's funky spot. My cocktail was strong and, grilled lobster was divine. At one point, I didn't care diddly squat, who was around me because I went deep on that bad boy with both hands and enjoyed the rich taste of my Nova Scotia lobster. In all seriousness, Lucille's definitely a lively spot to be in and has been a return of ours!"}
{"text":"We went to eat oysters and seafood. Too pricey for the quality that you get. The portion size of the main dish is small yet loaded with fries to fill your appetite. The servers are not helpful as they are trained not to customise your dish. Highly kid unfriendly place. 
One thing bothered me the most was that there was class system amongst  the servers. The order taker just took the orders and collected the tips. The food serving and clearing was done by hardworking associates who did not get any rewards. The waitress treated them in a derogatory way.  Coming back to the food - extremely fried non tasting food. Oysters were too small and waitress had no knowledge about the origin. They should learn from Pearl Diver in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great place for gatherings and groups I enjoy the smoking hot young waitresses with leather skirts when they wiggle service is moderate and the prices are a bit high because of the neighbourhood but it's the best seafood restaurant in town!!"}
{"text":"The place is small, not too much space between tables....BUT the food made the experience WORTH every penny!!! Recommend fish tacos, lobster rolls and chicken brochettes!!!! Yum yum"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Sunday. Had two pints of stella and fish and chips. They were just amazing. I had a great lunch.

The server was a little self-important, and the place has a bit of an air of arrogance. AND it's a little pricey. But all things considered, if I wanted a nicer meal, even if a bit pricier, I'd return. It's just a couple of things that offset this place from being 4 stars in my eyes."}
{"text":"Fancy little gem on Monkland street. It's super busy but not over the top crowded like their other dive bar in downtown. The service is wonderful. Beautiful waitresses dressed very well and enthusiastic to please all of your requests and hunger! They have wonderful cocktails and fine wine selections to chose from. I went for their white zinfandel sangria and their grilled octopus. My friend had their snow crab. He was a little disappointed with the size since he usually gets the alaskan king crab from the keg white is way bigger and easier to crack open as it is already pre cut for you and easy to munch on hehe. However, I Was super satisfied ! I don't think i've had better octopus anywhere else and whenever I feel like having octopus this is my first option! I am super delighted with their outmost freshness and service you will not leave here disappointed! If you are looking for faster service I would recommend to dine at the bar where they serve the oysters quicker and build a more personal relationship with you ! 

Overall, the ambiance, food and service was amazing and I can't complain ! A++ definitely will be back yummmyy"}
{"text":"First off, I'll start by saying that I went for a 5 a 7 event. However I was dissapointed to find that they don't have one. I only had  oysters and tried a few sweet potatoe fries from friends. Both were really good. The only reason I am not giving a higher rating is because it is a pricey for what you get. There are other places that offer the same for less. The staff is friendly !"}
{"text":"Like a mighty Phoenix, Lucille's rose from the ashes more powerful than ever. 

No reservations, because fuck you. Worth the wait though, whether it's 5 minutes or 55. 

I always go in thinking I'm going to order something different, but the words \"lobster roll\" fall from my lips without fail. 

Fish tacos are bonkers good. Desserts are homemade. I'd eat here every night if I could."}
{"text":"I've been to the Monkland location a few times and I can say the food is always fresh and always tasty. You may have to wait in line on a Friday or Saturday night because they don't take reservations but those oysters and those lobster rolls are worth the wait !"}
{"text":"They just moved to a beautiful location across the street. The service was impeccable. Food was good not great. Lovely staff. A big negative is that very loud music blaring over your head that forces yiu to scream to have a conversation. If it wasn't for the great service I'd give it 3 stars max"}
{"text":"Normally I put 4 stars on places I'm definitely going back to. This one is and I can't wait!

I hope to become a regular.

A warm welcome to start. The waitress ( I usually don't like waitresses because I have had too many experiences of often \"rude just there for the money ungracious\" attitudes. I prefer the calm of a male server) was completely getting us, was cool as hell and efficient.

The food: well I hang out in Maine a lot and am very picky with my seafood but I assure you (it will take me many visits but) there is not one item there I didn't want to try.  I had fresh oysters that the shucker served to the table personally. Very pretty presentation with homemade hot pepper-cilantro sauce and nice other classics. They have a great variety but the Daisy was my favourite. Chunky and salty but not too salty.

Lobster Mac'n cheese amazing!

The only downside in my opinion is the W/C being right beside the kitchen's open entrance. But it becomes a detail when you see how much attention and care is put into everything this place does. 

I'm half tempted to not share this place cause I want to keep it for myself!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a handful of times but this time I was really not impressed. We ended up going because we were having a hard time finding a resto close by that wasn't going to close at 11 pm and also I hadn't been to the new location on monkland yet.  I had the surf and turf which is usually a favorite of mine but the lobster roll was small and soggy. So sad. It used to be way better!! WHAT HAPPENED to this place!?!! Also my ribs were overcooked. My boyfriend's piece was juicier and more fatty than mine so I had some of his because mine was dry. I liked the sweet potato fries better than the regular fries and I never say this because I usually find sweet potato fries are too sweet for what I feel should be salty. I had the Caesar and it came with two big shrimps, two oysters and one clam. I gave my bf the clam (Hahaha)  because I'm not a fan of clams and he did not like it. The oysters and shrimp were good though and I enjoyed the Caesar.

I'm really hoping this place was just having an off night. :("}
{"text":"Very average food. Way to noisy! Overpriced! Heinz Ketchup bottles are refilled! Sparkling water homemade but they still charge full price for it.  Not impressed! Not going back!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh amazing. You have to ask for the deep fried ribs and the deep fried Samon head!  There is nothing that was not excellent"}
{"text":"Perhaps living on an actual coast has ruined me for oysters for the most part unless they are knock your socks off amazing, but even the clams here were 'meh'. The servers and bartender were all very sweet and I love the location, but my food was nothing to write home about.

Was seated quickly, the dressing options were cool and the service was friendly though. I give the place 3 stars instead of two for the Caesar's cause they had crab in them: YUM"}
{"text":"Nice place, nice service, nice dishes .. originals seafood hotdogs .. So if you feel like to pay 32$ for lobster hotdog go for it !"}
