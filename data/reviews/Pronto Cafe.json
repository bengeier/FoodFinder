{"text":"Small shop that's big on flavour!

Great quality gelato with a good variety of flavours. I LOVED the hazelnut (I tried their Nutella too but it didn't have the same depth of flavour that the hazelnut had). Their chocolate flavour is also good; a nice semi-sweet chocolate that isn't too sweet or creamy. Their pistachio is right on, if you're into that. I didn't like the tiramisu, unfortunately (It's usually one of my favourite gelato flavours).

Don't be fooled by the mini cup size ($3.50). It's a generous serving size, though the catch is that you are limited to only one flavour.

The service was great - friendly and efficient.

I will definitely be back, and am glad I live so close by!

P.S. The gelato went straight to my belly so I apologize for the lack of pics."}

Great flavours and the pistachio is real, not that glowing green stuff. Stopped in after a bike ride and had a small cup of pistachio and Amarino cherry, delicious!

I asked and was told that all the gelato is made in house from the best ingredients.

As a nice touch they had complimentary sliced watermelon on the counter, very homey.

Fermarsi per uno scoop o due!"}
{"text":"The gelato is amazing (as far as I understand it's all made in house), and the espresso is as authentic as it gets. Service is also great. 

I recommend the lemon gelato if you want something refreshing, or the espresso gelato if you love the taste of coffee like me. Regardless, all the flavours are delicious."}

There was a variety of gelato flavours and it was very rich in flavour. We both got the hazelnut. Would come back!"}
