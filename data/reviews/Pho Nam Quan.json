{"text":"...Nam Quan is situated in Villeray... in a renovated and rezoned basement apartment to be precise. The first time I visited this place, I thought one thing, \"who's living upstairs, and do they know this is going on?\" I wouldn't put it past them as billowing cauldrons of simmering beef broth has the ability to permeate not only your clothes for the rest of the day - but I'm convinced through gyprock and particle board to permanently embed itself into the actual soul and entity of the building..."}
{"text":"First of all let me start by saying that the soup was delicious, but the service was HORRIBLE!

We were a group of 6 people that came in for lunch on Saturday, from the very beginning we told the waiter that 2 of the people in the group were paying together, and that everyone else was paying separately. So we all went up to pay individually and as we paid left the establishment to get into our cars.... the last person to pay was held back and accused our group of not paying for a portion of our food (spring rolls)! Imagine that, you pay your bill and they hold back the last person in your group and accuse them of not paying for their bill completely and trying to make them pay for spring rolls that have already been paid. Now let me be clear spring rolls are not very much ($2-$3) but just the principle of them accusing someone of not paying and then trying to make them pay? So after half an hour they printed off all the receipts and were able to confirm that indeed everyone had paid their bill and that they were at fault. Not one apology was given nor were they apologetic at all. Will never go there again, and anyone that wants to go be careful and vigilant, they might try to get you to pay something that has already been paid."}
{"text":"I had Pho Tai Nam extra large and it wasn't that great. I'm a big eater so this opinion will not affect everyone, because it felt like a medium bowl to me and I could've eaten a couple of more of these bowls. The bowl is filled with a lot of broth, with a handful of noodles and meat. 

Noodles were on the firmer side.

The rare beef was really thin and small, gave about 6 pieces. The beef flank was a bit overdone, in which it melts in your mouth too easily. Not my type of beef flank, but was given a decent amount. 

The broth was more on the traditional side, but it had a bit of a sharp sour taste to it. But when mixed with the sauces (Hoisin and Sriracha) it made the broth a bit more tolerable. 

Experience on service is nothing more than mediocre. Given ice tea and order when you're ready."}
{"text":"Vietnamese here. 
Was craving pho the last day of our Montreal trip.
Not worth the extra 30 min drive outside the city.
Small place with small portion.
The Vietnamese ice coffee was pretty good though."}
{"text":"One of the best phos I've had in a long time. Worth the distance and the price.  The bowl was full compared to the last pho I had a few months ago in the West Island.  The broth was tasty.  The other dishes look good too.  
 This busy place is a family run business and sit about 25-30 patrons.  I won't hesitate to go back that far to have a good bowl of pho.

 Fully recommend."}
{"text":"This is a family business that is known to the viet community I believe. The broth is very tasty and rich in beef bone and other essential ingredients. the place serves Bun Bo Hue noodle everday instead of only on weekends at most places. I personally prefer the mild original pho broth. One negative remark about the food is that he portion size of noodle fluctuates from time to time. And sometimes the broth can be very greasy if you order a pho containing cooked beef flank. Very busy from Thurs to Sat."}
{"text":"I give this place a 5 star because, although it looks like a hole in the wall, you will not find better Pho in Montreal. I always order the Pho that's served with soft tendon, tripe and rare beef. It's to die for. Their savoury broth is one like no other. I'm slurping it by the bowl by the end of my meal. They have very good selection of other Vietnamese dishes besides the soup. Their shrimp tempura is some of my favourites! 

They offer take-out so you could always call in advance and it will be ready for you when you arrive. 

It's also cheap. The largest bowl is 9$."}
{"text":"Pas de déco mai les soupes sont parmis les meilleures à Montréal. Possibilité de demander des grosses nouilles rondes dans les soupes en remplacement des nouilles plates. Petit resto qui se rempli vite. Très bons prix, taxes incluent sur le menu."}
{"text":"This place has the best pho and best bun Bo hue in the city...good price...the reason I give 4 star...cause the place is not really clean...and the service is so so....but the food is so so good!!"}
{"text":"A small hole in the wall, selling inexpensive Vietnamese food. I ordered fried spring rolls, an iced coffee, and an all dressed pho, with an extra meatballs on the side.

The spring rolls sucked. Not wrapped in rice paper, the spring roll had a weird filling. It was severely lacking meat. The iced coffee tasted weirdly chocolatey and was not strong enough. Wouldn't order again.

The pho was solid tho. Deep rich beef broth full of spices, tasty meat cuts and very good, smooth, noodles. Would go back just for the pho."}
{"text":"Tasty and aromatic broth. You can really taste all the spices in the broth. I've only had the pho here and it's been delicious every time. I can't comment on any of the other dishes. Prices in the usual range for a pho place. I removed one star for the interior of the restaurant. It's basically in a semi basement, simple tables, not super clean and no ambiance whatsoever. Also the service can leave much to be desired. Waiters/waitresses are hard to flag down after taking the initial order."}
{"text":"Malheureusement, le pho est n'est plus ce qu'il était. Il dépanne bien, mais il y a eu un changement dans le chef cuisinier et cela paraît dans les plats. Le bun bo hue est encore très recommandable! L'assiette d'herbes fraîches restent le plus garnie de Mtl! 
Cette situation m'a permis d'essayer d'autres plats comme le riz au poitrine de poulet grille...merveilleux!"}
{"text":"This place is great Pho. I have had Pho all over the world and this was a great hole in the wall location. They only take cash or debit. No credit which is why i only gave the 4 stars. The place was packed and the food still came out really fast. They have a good selection of other Vietnamese items other then Pho and they looked just as good. This made it on my \"Get you some of that!\"."}
{"text":"Odd location, but it's the best Pho soup I've had in Montreal thus far."}
{"text":"Really quick serving pho.
Loved it.
Very tasty!! 
I had the special / pho dac biet with extra meat balls on the side."}
{"text":"I drove from downtown to this out of no where Pho. This place was packed and it's located like everyone said, hole in a wall... Out of nowhere.

The imperial roll is a bit soft in the inside compares to other pho places, it's like biting on an empty crispy fried roll. That one, I'll skip next time.

The main focus, PHO. I must say it is one of the best and by far from all the pho I've been in Montreal. It's super tasty, the beef are tendered. I drove 20 minutes from Downtown to here and it's totally worth it.

Service wise.. Well look, I get that they are busy, but it also questionable when I see people came in after start eating their pho when my order of imperial has not arrived yet.
I waited minimum 15 minutes before the first dish arrive (spring roll, shrimp rolled with rice paper).

Will I go? Absolutely, just for the pho but I won't go back every month though... It's a bit far..."}
{"text":"MMMM, one word to describe their pho....DELICIOUS! Came here on Wednesday evening and it was quite busy. We were seated right away. The restaurant is located in a little basement and it isn't the fanciest place. We ordered and the soups came right away. We ordered the DAC BIET. The broth was so tasty for a small size, it was packed with lots of meat + noodles. I love how they give us a side of chop suey + cilantro +  basil. One of the rare restaurants to serve the cilantro on the side. I wouldnt hesitate to come to this place again!"}
{"text":"En rentrant dans ce petit sous-sol qu'est le Pho Nam Quan, c'est comme si tu rentrais dans un autre univers. Ce petit restaurant familial composé de quelques tables seulement est presque toujours pleins alors attendez-vous à ne pas avoir de table sur le champ mais ne vous en fait pas car l'attente vaut le coup. Tous les plats sont gouteux, frais et sont peu couteux. C'est ici que vous allez trouver les meilleurs phos et Bun Bo Hue de Montréal! De plus, vous y trouverez une panoplie de mets vietnamien si vous voulez essayer autres choses. 

Je vous le recommande fortement!!"}
{"text":"2.5 Star

Nam Quan looks like a perfect hole in the wall restaurant in middle of no where (at least for out of town people like me) with promising of amazing Vietnamese food.

Arriving late at 8:30 pm on a weekday and the place was packed! We ended up waiting for around 15 minute for a table to open up. A wait for table?! This was really promising.

Imperial Rolls (Ch giò)? Small little spring rolls bite size for the \"imperial\" family? Not even made with rice paper wrapping. I would not recommend that.

Summer Roll was refreshing and quite decent.

Pho broth has a good herb flavour and love the subtle taste. However my Bun Bo Hue (Vietnamese Spicy Beef Noodle Soup) was just disappointing. Everything was a little off but this maybe my personal preference.

I am glad that I did not make a special trip coming here by transit as we had a rental car for the day. 

PS Cleanliness maybe an issue but what I did not see I guess I don't really know. My friends were trying to tell me something about the red chili.. I kind of tuned them out...."}
{"text":"Came here once because i was shopping at Kim Phat and was so hungry! I've always noticed this place but never went in because of the difficulty on finding a parking spot. I got lucky this time. So hubby and i both ordered a pho and some imperial rolls. I also ordered a bum bo hue to go. The food came out really fast but it was none the least good. I must admit that i don't understand what the rave is all about... I find that service was ok nothing worth mentioning and the place gets crowded very fast."}
