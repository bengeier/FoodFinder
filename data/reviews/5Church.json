{"text":"This review is long overdue....I had heard so many great things about this place and was terribly disappointed. I came twice just to make sure it wasn't just a bad taste in my mouth (not a cheap place either) and both times were mediocre at best. Food...ok. For the price it was not worth it. Service....ok. We had a large party of about 16 and one server......step ur game up! It took forever to get drinks, if you're trying to make money the point is to serve your customers. Not keep them waiting and asking other servers who pass by to find you. It seems so many of these uppity restaurants where you will automatically get grated, they lack in so many areas. They are lucky that there is gratuity tacked on because for the experience in its entirety it was not worth."}
{"text":"We arrived for Brunch at noon and were promptly seated. had to wait a little for the server to show up, but he was gracious and personable. We ordered Mimosas and he immediately said that we would have to wait as alcohol couldn't be served on Sunday until after 12 Noon. I checked my watch and pointed out that it was in fact after 12. He apologized and said he would place the order immediately. he came back a few minutes later and said he was sorry but the bar was out of champagne and could not make the Mimosa right then. He offered (or tried to upsell) but we said we would wait for the bar to get their act together. As it ended up, we probably would have been better off buying a bottle of Champagne and making our own- good OJ but VERY light on the bubbly. Maybe the food would be better.  He did offer good insight into the menu. We both ended up choosing the Shrimp and Polenta which was absolutely fantastic! Shrimp were juicy and flavorful, polenta creamy and delicious, the sauce was nuanced and perfectly complimented all the other parts, even had a little heat. Just wonderful!  Unfortunately, our server got over-seated with a larger party and that was pretty much the last we saw of him. We (and other tables near us) had to wait several minutes to get our check, and then of course get it processed and returned.  All in all, it would have been 2 star, but the food saved the day."}
{"text":"My best friend introduced me to this great bar. It has an amazing atmosphere and decor. I liked that is wasn't packed to the point where you feel you can't move but still enough eye candy to go around. I'll definitely be back and will highly recommend to my Lyft customers too."}
{"text":"Been here a few different times and each visit I get a different/weird experience.  It's either great service with a well-informed knowledgeable server or a complete train wreck that results in something being offered for free. I feel like this place is so close to being a great part of Charlotte and a unique restaurant that everyone can be proud of...but it's not there yet."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Pretty hip place. Not the best service, but the decor is interesting and the presentation was right on. I tried the lamb burger. It tasted 100% lamb. I usually prefer some sausage in the grind to cut the gamey taste, but it was cooked well nonetheless. Can't wait to go back in the evening and sample the cocktails. There are table seats and then there's an L-shaped bar area that looks like it would be cool for after dinner. I shalst see...."}
{"text":"Three other work colleagues and myself visited this restaurant in October 2012.  It's in a great Uptown location, and when I initially made a reservation, I thought the menu items would appeal to both my vegetarian and meat-eating colleagues.  We waited 20 minutes at our table before the server noticed us.  We had to go to the manager and actually ask him if we had a server.  Service was very very slow.  The food was ok....but we were STARVING.  After a long day working with no food, we were ready to roll up our sleeves, raid the kitchen and throw something on the grill.  It took over an hour from when we sat down to actually get our food.  The manager did end up comping desert, and it would not have been a big deal if I were enjoying a casual night out with friends.  But, the state of my stomach demanded food pretty immediately, and 5 Church did not live up to that expectation at all.  I dont think I would go back again...."}
{"text":"We had a reservation at 12:15pm for brunch and received a phone call at 12:10pm letting us know that our reservation was being cancelled and the restaurant was no longer serving brunch.  This was after we received a call an hour and a half earlier confirming our reservation for that day.  The person who called us offered no explanation, had no remorse, and to be honest, was very rude.  We had been there for drinks before, but never to eat.  After that terrible customer service experience, we will NOT be going back - - for anything!  Where has customer service gone these days?!  Very disappointed 5 Church, very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and poor. Meal for seven of us was served in two stages because they said it took more time to cook the steaks. No bread until we asked. No salt and pepper until we asked. Two had fettuccine which by the time we got it was inedible because it was over cooked and was gummy. No parmesan cheese either. Had one taken off the bill which they did not complain about but also never saw waiter after meal was served until we asked for the check. Very pricy for average food. Last time I will take anyone there."}
{"text":"Aweful!  We had a reservation at Capital Grille however concierge service at Ritz Carlton suggested we change to Five Church.  The staff is very pleasant. The ambiance is average.  The food is less then average and bland.  The menu is limited.  It was very disappointing."}
{"text":"5Church was satiating in many ways: cuisine, atmosphere, service, diversity.    The cuisine was delicious: black bean hummus, quinoa, fried beet sliders, flatbread (and those are just the appetizers, or \"Snacks\" as 5Church refers to these options), caramel nut pie for dessert (with a sweet potato base -- pure genius) -- was also salivating over the description of the s'mores and the double chocolate cake, so will have to go back to sample those sweet treats.  Several entrees looked fantastic -- the ingredients and accompanying sides seemed perfectly chosen: wasabi crusted salmon, for example.  The atmosphere was intimate, interesting, and entertaining.  The space is well laid out -- plenty of room between tables so even though it's a very open area, the time with my friend felt private and cozy.  The furniture is funky and comfortable; the lighting is unique and just right -- not too bright, not too dim; even the bathroom faucets were fun.  There was a positive vibe in the restaurant -- a consistent buzz of folks coming and going, pleasant conversations, lots of laughter.  The folks who work at 5Church seem to sincerely enjoy interacting with each other and with the patrons -- when servers, hosts, managers, owners, bartenders, and chefs are walking around chatting amongst the crowd, the dining experience feels more like a community party.  Though it was the first time that my friend and I had visited the restaurant, we were treated like \"regulars\" and attended to like we were long-time pals.  It's amazing the difference it makes when the people who work at a restaurant balance the need to be efficient with the ability to be fun and interesting.  The diversity in 5Church also enhanced the overall experience -- from the artwork on the walls and ceiling, to the patrons representing a mix of demographics, to the creative menu, it was an incredibly fulfilling time.  I'm looking forward to brunching at 5Church on a Saturday morning, rocking out to a DJ on a Friday night, grabbing a mid-week lunch with a colleague, and taking friends there when they visit the QC."}
{"text":"A little loud, but the food is always great. The black bean hummus and bacon pizza are amazing. They also have really good cocktails if you want to do happy hour."}
{"text":"Incredible food.  Great trendy interior.   Had waygu steak, can't go wrong tender and delicious.  Prime beef bolognase was delicious but really really rich and heavy so if your looking for something light this isn't it.  Crispy pork belly and pork belly spring rolls were amazing.  Most favorite was the broiled oysters, very different but was fantastic, made like Rockefeller but with grits and quail egg.  It was fantastic could have ordered several dozen more !    Only complaint it's loud, hard to carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"Do not come here for lunch unless you have a 3 hour window.  We Arrived at 12:05 for lunch. Should've realized something was wrong as all other restaurants in the area were full and this one was half empty. Over an hour later by 1:20 we left because our food had still not arrived.  Our  waitress was not attentive at all. We could barely get her to  come to our table. She was definitely not too concerned about the fact that we were waiting for our food for over an hour. She never even offered us refills on our drinks while we were sitting there waiting for our food for over an hour!  Everytime we asked her about our meal she told us their kitchen was backed up. The excuse was hard to believe because the place was half empty.    We were not the only customers that left hungry and disappointed  as I noticed other tables of people getting up and leaving before their food arrived.   We ended up getting fast food sandwiches down the street to take back to our office as we had burned way past our lunch hour.  Total disaster!"}
{"text":"We had a fabulous dinner.  We sat at the bar as the tables were full.  We were greeted by Karma & Drew aka fab bartenders who were on it! Karma offered a taste of a new wine I had never considered.... a French choice & Drew made great suggestions from the menu.  My crispy chicken was divine! My husband loved his Deckle steak .  Tonight was amazing.  We will definitely return and prob sit at the bar:)."}
{"text":"Good food, albeit somewhat limited menu. Very attentive and friendly service. Pleasant atmosphere. Not highest rating b/c weak wine list & extremely miss-priced (overpriced) champaign list."}
{"text":"Haven't been for dinner but went in with my buddy for drinks.  decor is different but I think I liked it...  Drinks were awesome.  Will have to come back for food.  bartender was cool, left us alone but was around when we needed him.  We were def not in the hipster crowd like everyone else there"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I got the scallops and they were the best I have ever had. My date had the wasabi crusted salmon and he thoroughly enjoyed it. Waiter was especially knowledgeable about the wine selection and suggested the perfect pairing to our meal. Took off a point because they seated me with my back to the kitchen and something my thumping against my back the entire meal and my seat was shaking as well. Rather distracting and annoying when you're trying to enjoy a romantic meal out. So tip: make sure you don't get seated on the upper level right by the staff entrance to the kitchen or whatever that room is."}
{"text":"I come to Charlotte frequently for work but tried this place out for brunch on a rare occasion when visiting during the weekend. Apparently this place is mostly a dinner/bar scene.  We were in a large group and were overall quite happy across the vectors of food, service and ambiance.   The modern/eclectic decor seems a little out of place down south (chalk it up to northern banking industry transplants) but still warm and inviting. I can see Charlotte still hasn't fully made the transition to a residential downtown (people living/working in same area), so I'd expect more places like this to start popping up - which is a good thing.  Food is fantastic and the portion size is HUGE, ie no one came close to finishing. The lamb burger in particular seemed to be a real hit.  Service was solid and managed the group at an off peak hour expertly.   I was dismayed to learn they don't serve breakfast weekday (when I usually visit), but I'd definitely come back when in town."}
{"text":"Good food overshadowed by all around bad service.  We made reservations for a large party (about 10 people) many weeks in advance. We all showed up on time but still had to wait 20 minutes for our table. The bartenders were rude. We had arranged for a semi-private, quieter area but somehow got seated smack in the middle of the bar.  It was possibly the WORST table in the restaurant, especially for a large group. It took over 2hours to get our food, which was cold when it arrived.  By this time, the 11:00 crowd had literally descended on our table.  People were jamming into us and setting drinks and beer bottles on our table as we ate.   Literally one of the worst dining experiences ever..."}
{"text":"We've been to 5Church 3 times now....Favorite dishes are the signature 60 second steak (cooked for more than 60 seconds on one side until well and barely hits the grill on the other, so very rare...They say the chef auditioned with this one...I see how he got the job.  My other favorite is the Wasabi crusted Salmon...I am not much of a salmon fan - but this will keep me coming back for more.  The wait staff is always very helpful and the atmosphere is very much funky fun in Uptown.  If someone is visiting and wants a great vibe for Charlotte - this is the palce to go - or to bring them...."}
{"text":"Went in for Saturday brunch, we thought it would be busy but wasn't. Our waiter was awesome! Our food didn't take long to come but we were very disappointed in the waffles they were over cooked. The rest of the food was good but needed a waffle to make it a heartier meal. The best part of brunch were the 2.50 mimosas and Sangrias!!!! What a deal!!! This was awesome! We thought they had bottomless but didn't but this was about the same in my opinion. The banana bread is also Very good as well. If I'm I'm in Charlotte again I would def come back for the drinks!"}
{"text":"My 2 stars comes from my handful of times here. I've been at happy hour and the bar service was lacking. I came for lunch and the chicken cordon bleau was out of this world! This in itself gained them a star. My wife and I went for dinner on a weekend night and our food took forever, and when my wife got her steak, it was so dry. The manager came by and said they had another one cooking that could come out in 10 minutes. That was after the first one too some 40 minutes to come out. The replacement was better. Paid full price even though the steak was inedible.   Came back for brunch that same Sunday, and our food took forever...again. We thought it might've taken so long the other night because they were busy, but this was a much slower time. When my omelet came out, it wasn't even what I had ordered. Again, paid full price and no attempt or pressure to provide good customer service.   We may be back, but this will no longer be a destination spot for us going forward."}
{"text":"The Bottom Line: Fantastic starters but it's downhill from there.  This is such a frustrating review to write. On first impression 5 Church sets you up for a 5 star evening but it quickly runs out of steam. Entrees are good and desserts are disappointing.  They seem to be aimed at the young crow who is happy to congregate 5-deep at the bar and order bar snacks which are actually really good.  They have the potentials to do so much better."}
{"text":"God awful service. Worst dining experience I've had in Charlotte and I've lived here for 15 years. No apologies for forgetting our food and drink. Very snooty atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very just OK.  Went for restaurant week, but on a Sunday so it was not very busy.  The hostess could not have been more annoyed that we arrived and asked for our table.  The waiter was not great.  And the food was very ehhhh.  The plastic chairs were also pretty uncomfortable.  All in all, I wouldn't go back unless I was going somewhere with a friend who was choosing it for their birthday dinner and I couldn't override their pick."}
{"text":"Went to 5Church for post-work happy hour drinks, and although I was expecting it to be crowded and noisy, we actually questioned whether they were even open as we walked in.  Grabbing a seat at the completely empty bar, we found menus and starting perusing the drinks.  The drinks were good (5Church - yum!), but service suffered.  Feeling a bit snacky, I ordered the chickpea salad, but was brought the black bean hummus.  I called the bartender over to confirm if this was my order and she said \"oh, I must have keyed it in wrong,\" took it away, and brought me my order about 5 minutes later.  Shoulda kept he hummus, because the chickpea salad wasn't anything to write home about.  When the checks arrived, I had been charged for the hummus, which cost $1 more.  I spent about 5 minutes trying to fly down the bartender again (keep in mind, it's still emmmmmpty at this point), and when I pointed out the mistake, I was told \"well, they're they same price.\"  After informing her that in fact they weren't, she finally changed my check, but did so begrudgingly.    All in all, 5Church is an interesting space, but seems to think it's better than it actually is.  We'll see if it sticks around longer than other establishments that have preceded that space."}
{"text":"I've been to 5Church both as a bar and for dinner. It is a really fun addition to uptown. Very cool decor and atmosphere. When I went as a bar the first time this summer, it was the weekend and pretty crowded. When I went more recently, it was a Thursday night and not very crowded. Some of the bar managers were sitting at the bar and treated me and my girlfriends to our first round of beers. It was a pretty fun time. I decided to go there for my birthday dinner with my parents and sister, and it definitely didn't feel like the appropriate place to dine with my parents. It was pretty loud in there and just a bit too trendy for a family dinner. However, the food was really good. My sister ordered the lamb burger and said it was delicious. My dad and I both ordered the chicken with sweet potato mash, and it was delicious. My parents both ordered the bibb lettuce salad to start. I tried some and must say it was really good but doused in dressing. I couldn't eat part of it. Overall, would definitely recommend for a weekend night out or dinner with friends or a date."}
{"text":"Driving down south on a road trip from NYC and spent the day in Charlotte, NC.  I had a list of burgers to try in every state along the trip, but never heard of '5 Church'.  A bartender recommended '5 Church' saying the food was amazing, and they have a great burger too.  So, rather than take her word on it, I double checked some reviews/pics of the food on here and decided to try it...  HOLY SHIT that was some great food!  Coming from NYC, I didn't expect this, but I was blown away.  The restaurant is beautiful, and everything I ate was great... especially the burger!  I know it's a \"lamb burger\", and as a burger purest, but lamb is still considered red meat, so it's a legit burger (unlike those BS chicken, turkey, veggie, etc... fake burgers).  Even their crispy confit potato \"fries\" were amazing.  Here I am back in NY, wishing I had '5 Church' a lot closer than 650 miles..."}
{"text":"VisitedCharlotte and stopped here for brunch. Was impressed that mimosas were $3! Thought the devote was beautiful in the restaurant.  The food was good.  I had the ham and egg madam sandwich, it was good. My husband got the lamb burger, he liked it.  Overall it was a good restaurant."}
{"text":"I would like to start this letting everyone know that I have been in the restaurant business for a very long time and I am not writing this blindly.   My husband and I were celebrating our first thanksgiving without family and decided to volunteer in the morning and then go to a nice dinner - we made reservations at 5church because we heard it was amazing. We went and it was terrible. Service was awful, the restaurant smelt like dirty laundry and the food left a lot to desire. Very disappointing - we were hoping for a wonderful experience and it didn't happen."}
{"text":"Don't really have anything negative with this place except I wish we would've sat at a real table instead of the couch seating area by the door...that would've been fine if we were just having drinks and apps but not a full meal. I was cold most of the time, I hate eating when I'm cold.  My friend and I spilt the pan roasted mahi-mahi and the wasabi crusted salmon, neither of us could make up our minds. Both were delicious, and the best part is the chef spilt them before they were brought to the table, very helpful. Also enjoyed the appetizers we shared, the bacon pizza was the favorite...I mean it's bacon, how can you go wrong with bacon!! Chose the house Malbec, thought it was much better than Soul Gastrolounge.   Some other choices that night were the lamb burger and the grilled yellow fin  tuna, everyone seemed to enjoy their selections. Good vibe there, place was packed for a Wednesday evening.   Spent a little more than I had intended, feel it's a bit pricy, but it is an uptown restaurant and great tasting food."}
{"text":"I want to start out with the upsides of this restaurant. It's beautiful, seriously, the set up is open and inviting. The presentation of the food is equally as appealing.   The downsides however, were where it counts for me. The service was not all that personable. We were met with lack luster, and even at times sarcastic employees (at least is my groups opinion). It was bumpy to start out with, considering it wasn't that busy and we weren't being overly rowdy or loud. The waiter treated us as if we were a burden, and it was really disappointing.   The food itself was okay. It took a long time to receive it, and wasn't that special. I had the lamb burger with fries which were too salty, the burger bun was slightly soggy, the meat however was pretty yummy. My friend got pasta, which was large, but she said it was bland. We also got lettuce wraps, which were forgettable.   I'm confused, maybe we came on an off day, if we decide to return it will be awhile. There are better options in this neighborhood in my opinion, I at least want to go somewhere that makes me feel welcomed."}
{"text":"The entire text from the Sun Tzu book The Art of War is transcribed on the ceiling! This is truly unique and worth going in to see.  Story is it took the artist and his wife (who read while he wrote) about six months to create the massive piece of art.   Good atmosphere, nice art on walls and subtle jazz at the right level to compliment. The wasabi encrusted yellow fin tuna is very tasty with just the right amount spice from the wasabi."}
{"text":"I should have taken the time to read more of the reviews as my personal experience is not positive. I made a reservation for this past Sunday 12/10 to avoid the drama of a NFL Sunday as this restaurant appeared like it was a good place to honor reservations and looked really nice. Was I wrong about this assumption. We arrived on time for our reservation at 11:30 that was made on Open Table to be informed that they were still attempting to seat 11:00 reservations because people were staying longer than usual. Football Sunday and you have not figured this out? Guy was leaving as we walked in very upset with service at the bar. Then I was flippnently told that we had to wait for an indeterminate period for a table that could not be guaranteed. And oh by the way we have still attempting to seat the 11:00 clock crowd. We saw these poor people standing there and decided to back to RiRa. Next thing I get a notice from Open Table that I did not show for my reservation. Bad form 5Church you suck."}
{"text":"I'm not typically a fan of Restaurant Week reviews, because the experience is not the same as a typical meal...but here goes. We'd read a lot about 5Church and their RW menu looked to offer some of their standard menu items, so we booked it for fairly early on the first Saturday of Queen's Feast. We arrived about 30 minutes early to enjoy a drink at the bar. The bartenders were friendly and the drinks were delicious. I had the 5Church (lychee martini) and my husband had the New Fashioned. Before we knew it, our table on the third level was ready. The seating is interesting in that they have several different levels of small seating areas. From where we were seated you couldn't see the famous Art of War ceiling. I ordered the pork belly appetizer, wasabi crusted salmon, and smores cake. My husband had the tomato soup, hangar steak, and banana pudding. The tomato soup won the appetizer round, the guy at the table next to us even leaned over and commented on how good it was. The pork belly was good, but required a lesson from the waitress on how to best enjoy it. The wasabi crusted salmon was delicious, not too spicy at all, just a little bite to it. The bok choy and the miso emulsion under the fish was fantastic, and this coming from a non-miso lover. My husband enjoyed his hangar steak and horseradish mashed potatoes. The smores cake was the dessert we preferred, the \"deconstructed\" banana pudding was good too. All in all a delicious meal, and we'll be back to enjoy the full menu at some point soon. We're also excited to try the new restaurant this group is opening in South End sometime this fall. In this case, Restaurant Week served it's purpose and piqued our interest."}
{"text":"5Church is a new restaurant in Uptown Charlotte, NC.  An amazing amount of effort went into the design of the restaurant.  It has a very contemporary decor with a hip vibe.  All colors are white, gray and black, so nothing is overpowering, yet nothing missed.  Novels coat the ceiling, which makes great conversation upon entering.  Seating is well placed with the exception of the long table near the bar.  Seating here can become crowded and somewhat uncomfortable to have a conversation.  One thing lacking was acoustics.  There really wasn't much thought given to the noise level in the design and as a result, when it becomes busy, it is very difficult to hear.  Aside from this, it is truly a beautiful place.  We started with cocktails, which were quite good.  Not the best we have had, but above average.  We enjoyed the cheese plate to start, which was amazing.  There was a goat cheese, a gruyere, and a sheep's milk cheese each paired with a very well organized compote.  Here we started our pairing of wine with a pinot noir.  A crisp, light, cherry flavor that went extremely well with the cheese.  A must if you dine at 5Church.  My girlfriend and I both opted for the 60 Second Steak; an interesting take on preparation.  The steak is cooked mostly on one side and the turn is for only 60 seconds.  We both ordered medium rare and when the steaks arrived, you could see all of the temperatures layered throughout the steak with the majority being your ordered temperature.  This is not a steak for those who like medium well or well.  The steak was good, but lacked a proper amount of seasoning.  This was offset by the sauce served with the steak, which was spicy and sweet, but a little too overpowering.  Still, quite good and prepared well.  We added the lobster mac and cheese, which was bursting with various molten cheese, full of the various flavors and accompanied by large pieces of lobster.  One of the best I have had.  A great night out at 5Church, but I expected a bit more flavor from the steak and wished the noise level was a little less."}
{"text":"The concept and food looks really good....to bad we did not stick around to try it.   The bar staff unfortunately lacks in service so onto the next stop."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in long time. We had no reservations, but they squeezed four of us in at the bar upstairs. It ended up being great.. The bartender was gracious, helpful and gave us excellent service without being too chummy.   Had the quinoa tabbouleh app, wasabi salmon and peanut butter cake for dessert. I only wish I got the banana pudding like my friends. The cake was good, but not at the same level as everything else.   The flavors, balance of ingredients and innovative details make this place a standout. Charlotte is fortunate to have 5 Church! This place will be a regular in my rotation."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, have never been dissapointed there. Food is excellent.  One of my top three favorite Charlotte Uptown Restaurants.  Don't forget to look up. The Art of War is hand written on the ceiling."}
{"text":"Have now been here a couple times.  While I think it is a great atmosphere and place to get a drink, I've always been very underwhelmed by the food and when you combine that with value, I think 1 star is generous."}
{"text":"Went here after my friends wedding. A server came, greeted us and took my drink order. She then asked for a credit card to open a tab. More people came to the after party and I never saw the server again until I looked outside and saw her leaving her shift. I then went to the bar to close my tab. The bartender had no idea where my CC was and frankly didn't care. I thought he went to find out but noticed he started taking drink orders for other customers and would not come back down to help. I left the bar and called back a couple days later to ask where my credit card was - they didn't know but I would definitely hear back within 24 hours. Two days later I called back because I noticed they charged me. They finally found my credit card (as a reminder I had to proactively reach out). Problem is I'm from out of town and am no longer able to pick up the card which means pretty major inconvenience for me. I now have to cancel my main credit card. This is a very nice expensive restaurant. It's completely unprofessional that my card was misplaced by an employee and no one cared to follow up. Too bad as I really liked the ambiance and food."}
{"text":"I had lunch at 5Church and was surprisedly impressed.  Our server, Yianni, was INCREDIBLE.  Very attentive without being overbearing.  One of our party is pregnant and Yianni ran to the kitchen several times to ask the chef if certain items were safe.  The black bean hummus and quinoa tebouleh were phenomenal.  They complemented each other well and if I hadn't been at a work lunch, I would have been licking the bowls.  The grilled prosciutto di parma was mouthwatering.  Served on grilled buttered bread, this panini was stuffed full of prosciutto and mozzarella. And get a side of fries to share.  Trust me.   The decor is upscale and trendy and the attention to detail is fantastic.  Visit the second floor and see the artists' interpretation of the $5 bill.  Great for groups, parties, bar scene or just a dinner or lunch with friends.  I'm a fan.  They also  have a NY style brunch complete with DJ.  I can't wait to visit for that!"}
{"text":"I'm usually tougher on reviews than the average rating, but I'm really surprised at how low this one is considering how much we enjoyed it.  Top notch food from appetizers to dinner and dessert.  The atmosphere was hip and modern. I've only been once but definitely plan to go back when I have out of town visitors soon!"}
{"text":"Recently went to 5Church on a Saturday evening. Was excited to try this place, and have heard good things. Our reservation was late...8:30pm. I guess because of the hour this place felt more like a club, than a restaurant. At any rate the atmosphere was pretty cool and we were immediately shown to our table. We ordered cocktails. I was excited for a dirty martini because this place looked like they would know their way around a cocktail. The rest of my party (6 total) ordered cocktails, and in about 10 minutes another server was back with our drinks. He was pretty confused and had messed up most of my orders. One martini came with no olives, and my friends scotch was served with a lime...which was new. They fixed our drinks and we took a look at the menu. I had a steak. Everyone was asked what temp to cook their steak at, except me. It was so loud I just didn't think about it till my steak came and it was practically still mooing. I needed it to be about medium. They took it back, and everyone else ate while I waited for my meal to be re-fired. When it got back to me it was just OK. A little tougher than you would hope from a 40.00 steak. The mashed potatoes were good, and the gorgonzola cream sauce that accompanied the steak was also yummy...heavy, but that was to be expected. After dinner we ordered dessert. We chose the chocolate flourless cake. This was the most disappointing dessert I have ever had...ANYWHERE. The waitress brings the dessert knowing that everyone at the table wanted a taste, and it is literally the smallest thing I have ever seen. The entire dessert measured 1/2 inch high, and 1.5 inches long. Not even enough for everyone to have a small bite. It was almost as if they had run out...and gave us scraps.  I won't go to 5church again. Me and my husbands total was 210.00 and we both agreed we would have been happier, and fuller if we had dined somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere  Excellent calamari  Ragu pasta with truffles was the best Wine list was great value"}
{"text":"You come to this place to be seen and see other chic people like yourself. It reminds me of a hip bar in NYC or Rome. The staff is very prompt and courteous. I had the roasted chicken with creamy mash potatoes and it was good. For $20 though I think I could've been a tad bit better. However, no one comes here for the food, you come to be seen and order good drinks. Also, it had a really good crowd for a Thursday night."}
{"text":"Visited this trendy restaurant and wanted to enjoy it. The service staff were polite and attentive.  The appetizers were  tasty but service was very slow and the food was cold. I think the entre would have been very good but it's impossible to say - cold steak and potatoes just don't cut it."}
{"text":"Good service, but disappointing biscuits.  I ordered their take on biscuits and gravy.  While the chicken etouffee gravy was tasty, the biscuit was was dry and heavy.  Our server (Grace) offered to bring another biscuit or dish, but I declined.  If you try this spot for brunch, avoid the biscuits."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a drink the other night and thought the place was gorgeous.  The staff was friendly and I loved the mixed drink menu.  Looking forward to coming back for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"While browsing Yelp for dinner options, I came across 5Church but have to admit that it was not the destination when heading out to dinner.  It turns out a lot of places are closed on Sundays in Charlotte, which I am not used to in San Francisco so it didn't even dawn on us to check, so this was stop #4.  My two colleagues had the filet but I decided to give the 60 second NY strip steak a try.  I was a bit leery, since it was an unusual way of cooking the steak but turned out to be quite tasty, although I can't say I have a lot of NY strips to compare it to.  I'm usually a ribeye girl.  Anyway, the steak is seared on one side so it's nice and crusty but they don't flip the steak so the other side is raw.  It comes with a choice of sides and a sauce.  I got their house sauce which is like A-1 - tasty.  The smashed potatoes were quite creamy.  I also added a side of broccoli, which they added red pepper flakes that added a nice kick to it.  Very friendly and attentive staff.  Oh, I almost forgot - they also gave us a free appetizer of the white bean hummus."}
{"text":"Update: we raved about this place to my family. Having gone several times and LOVING it. We took my family out for restaurant week. The food once again was mind blowing, but I was completely disgusted with the service. Our waiter clearly didn't want to be working. He tried rushing us through the meal and didn't produce a smile one time during the course of dinner. The entire point of restaurant week is to get more clientele to your restaurant. Clearly, they were only interested in getting people in and out as quickly as possible. I am also utterly disgusted by the manager. He talked to all the other tables around us, but never us. I'm assuming because we were a younger crowd. Remember that a younger crowd could create better tips because of the extras we like to order. Needless to say, I'm not sure I would recommend this place to others. You can't have great food and poor service. It's a shame, because they will lose return customers like myself."}
{"text":"I loved this place! From the unique menu to the novel on the ceiling - this place is just fun. Hip and trendy downtown restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. My wife had the scallops and I had the wild caught salmon, food was superb. The service was excellent and we were very pleased with the entire operation. Justine, our waiter, was friendly & helpful."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my night at 5Church for dinner and drinks with friends.  We arrived a little late for our reservation (sorry 5Church!) but we were welcomed at the door and promptly seated at our table.  Unfortunately, they were out of the bottle of wine we wanted to order, BUT our server quickly suggested their replacement and another bottle for us to order instead. The wine was fantastic and the food was amazing.  5Church definitely held up to my expectations."}
{"text":"Been here two times already and both times the food has been exceptional!! From their appetizers to dessert, loved everything about this place!!!"}
{"text":"Went to 5church in Charlotte on Thanksgiving and the one in Charleston on Christmas. Their holiday prix fixe menu had some of your traditional dishes with a nice update. Flavors were great and service was decent. I loved the decor and ambiance! We'll have to come back and try the regular menu."}
{"text":"I've now been to 5Church twice and the food, service and atmosphere have been consistent. Great food (grateful for vegetarian options!) - cordial service, fun, busy and loud atmosphere.   I also appreciate the attention to detail that went into the decor. Check out the script on the ceilings...Sun Tzu's 13 chapters of the 'Art of War'."}
{"text":"We had family in from all over the country and had heard good things about 5Church. We were seated promptly. The waitress came over quickly and served water. She then returned and got drink orders but didn't bother taking orders for my older mother or teen daughter, like they didn't exist.  That really bothered us.  Service was very good and we received our appetizers and drinks efficiently. The specialty drinks ordered by a few in our party were well received.  But, that's about all I can say nice. The waitress did not know the menu and was too busy to help us. She acted annoyed when we asked questions about the entres. For Charlotte this is an expensive restaurant and we should have had better menu knowledge.The waitress was 21, at best.  She acted 21, at best.  The entres arrived in an appropriate amount of time BUT WERE COLD. Not just one item, but every entre was cold, including the family style sides we ordered. Cold steak, cold mashed potatoes, cold everything. At this point, what do you do? Do you send it back and extend a meal that was already long? We just sucked it up.  The bill for our party of six was about $450 but that included two non-drinkers so a fairly hefty amount to spend for one night. The food was simply not worth it, not even close. If you are going to spend that much on a meal, it needs to be very good, or at least warm.   Word of warning - you are rolling the dice on this place. Clearly something is wrong in the kitchen. This was, at best, mall chain quality and boutique prices."}
{"text":"If this is Charlotte's best restaurant then I better not eat anywhere else in this city. I'm in town for a short visit and stopped by here after reading the local press. To be fair this would be a 1.5 to 1.75 star rating.   Service: 1.5/5  Sat at the bar for a quick bite before the dinner rush. I don't know if the bar is not used to serving food but food coming before cutlery was interesting. I also had to lift up my appetizer as I was eating so a napkin \"placemat\" could be out down. There was no cutlery exchange for the main course while not a deal breaker isn't pleasant in mixing flavours. The bartender was not particularly attentive, no water, no asking if I needed a cocktail nor a check in with how everything was. She did seem preoccupied with talking about just turning 21 and chatting socially with bar patrons. Not really professional and definitely did not make me want to order more drinks. That's the kind of bartending I expect at a sports bar.  It's a shame that a solo diner spending $50+ gets less service than someone having one drink order. It's a bigger shame since I'm a big fan of cocktails and usually spend $100+ on a meal and good drinks but the service did not compel me to do so.   Drinks: 1/5  I ordered the namesake \"5church\" with the intent on trying more but it was not well made. It was way too sweet and not balanced. As I watched the bar I noticed the bartenders weren't tasting the cocktails to see if they were proper. If you have a serious cocktail program you'd want them perfect and consistent. Unfortunately it seems more occupied with the trend rather than concerned about quality. It did not instil confidence in the rest if the cocktails. If the service was better I may have tried another one.   Food: 2/5 The artisan cured meat plate was okay. I was told it was house cured and I was expecting more for house cured meats but it wasn't bad nor spectacular.  The shortribs...where to start. The meat was bordering on dry but it was at least hot while the rest of the dish was cold. It was bland but the sauce and potato garnish was way over salted. I really could have used some water. Unfortunately mixing under seasoned meat with over seasoned sauce isn't pleasant either. The Brussels sprout leaves were spot on though but it was not a good dish. Dish presentation was good. To say it's hotel convention food quality would be a disservice to hotels.   Usually I would have said something but no one bothered to check in at anytime during the meal. When I asked for the bill, the bartender did ask how things were. I let her know about the sauce and that the dish was meh, she said sorry and there was nothing else. I would have sent back the dish if there was better service but at that point I was famished from not eating all day. I was so unimpressed that I just wanted to cut my losses and leave as soon as possible.   Go if you want to be part of the scene. Avoid if you like good food and drinks or good service. Disappointing effort tonight and if this is an example of the food scene here then Charlotte is not a food destination."}
{"text":"We decided to try out 5 Church as I had seen pictures of it online.  This is a very unique venue.  The décor is unlike any place I have been.  The food was amazing.  As I looked around and watched the other customers get their dishes I could see all of the amazing ways they presented the food.  The service was good.  This is definitely a place we would visit again....we kept finding interesting aspects to the restaurant...from the lighting, to the ceiling, to the pillars and chairs.  All of that aside, the food was fabulous and that is why we will go again."}
{"text":"I'm at brunch here today at 5Church.  I haven't made a review for quite some time, but my experience today encouraged me to make one.   First of all I want to point out the consistency of the design elements throughout the place. I was constantly noticing things throughout the establishment as my brunch went on. The ceiling has intricate writings and the check book you get at the end of the meal matched. The couches and tables and lamps and decor was all inviting and interesting.   But we don't really go to a restaurant for the atmosphere alone, but in this case I was struck with the feeling that the same effort would be evident in the offerings available. Well, turns out I was right. The food was delicious. The offerings are inventive and interesting.   Then, moving onto the staff. Everyone working was gracious, helpful, professional and friendly.   To wrap up, I will say that I really enjoyed my meal (hence my gushing review, sorry) and will add this place to my \"frequently visited places\". I hope others enjoy this place as much as I have."}
{"text":"After reading so many positive reviews for this restaurant, I had high expectations and couldn't wait to try it.  5Church did not disappoint!  I booked a table for my birthday dinner, and we loved it.  Everyone at the restaurant really made me feel special for going there to celebrate my birthday.  There was no forced \"Happy Birthday\" sung to an uncomfortable table.  Instead we had great dessert and excited smiles.  The menu was divine.  You won't find the same thing here you'll find everywhere else, and it's so refreshing!  The creative food combinations were not at all pretentious like you'll find at some places.  The atmosphere is fun, inviting and unique. Great for a date, party, or happy hour. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate when the establishment is known for great food but has awfully, horrid service. Today was no different. Perhaps I'm so critical because I was a server for many years.  Our brunch was delish...once it was finally served but it was quite the chore to get condiments to our table. Even the manager asked if we needed anything else and when we told him condiments it went unacknowledged. There was also someone's hair in my water, thank goodness for my alternate drink (let's hope no additional unwarranted items were in that as well). The server was lucky to have received a gratuity at all, but we left 15% (low for us) and left without speaking to the manager since he wouldn't be of any help anyways."}
{"text":"My wife and stopped by for lunch. The food was very good. We had the Lamb Burger and the pasta special.  Service was also good.  Really the only thing that stood out was that I got the last bit of fries.  There was a large party and everyone had a sandwich and fries.  My guess was that they probably ran out and just scraped enough to put on my plate.  The food was flavorfull and I think it warrants the higher price."}
{"text":"You would never know that you're in Charlotte when you step into 5Church. The atmosphere alone is amazing. Classy, Modern, Elegant but not stuffy. In addition to the excellent local fresh food that they serve (try the roasted vegetables) but they also have a great wine selection. They also accommodated to diet restrictions and were spot on. Great place and will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"The decor is disjointed and the noise level is very high. We went on a Saturday night and it was almost offensive. Too much to carry on conversation. The service was extremely slow. My crispy tofu was delicious but the vegetables beneath it were excessively salty. The cocktail I had was awful. Too bad that five church missed the mark on so many things because I would love a bowl of the tofu alone! I was surprised they charged me for my drink since I didn't drink much of it and voiced my opinion on it. The shared app for the table also went on my bill without asking either. For all these reasons, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Poor service for bar dinning.  Scallops dish was disappointing to say the least....and for $35, why do I have to ask for the complementary hummus?"}
{"text":"PHILLIPE STARCK GHOST CHAIRS only complement the modern yet welcoming decor.  Tall ceilings (with the entire Art of War hand-painted on them) and custom artwork by famed Charlotte tattoo artist Rodney Rains complement the urban feel.  There are a few seating options- low, comfy couches, traditional tables, and a long bar area with a gastropub feel.  We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and were promptly seated.  Boys enjoyed noda's ramblin on red on draft and we found a (a few) bottles off the wine list.  The cocktails looked great and we will be back to sit at the bar top for some drinks and small plates.  Started off with the gnocci, chickpea salad, goat cheese, spinach dip, black bean hummus $3?! and toasted mushroom ravioli.  Chef Jamie sent out crispy szechuan pork belly with spicy cabbage and stopped by to ensure we were enjoying ourselves (we were).  Don't miss the french style gnocci or toasted mushroom ravioli.  Entree-wise I opted for the Tokyo noodle soup with roasted pork, confit turkey, poached egg, veggies, and a dark smokey broth that was amazing.  I tried the 60 second prime ny strip steak- melted in my mouth good.  Niman ranch pork chop was a huge cut and perfectly prepared.  Dessert was pronounced great by those who tried it- some sort of banana cake with ice cream.  It was the end of the night so things are a little wine/food coma fuzzy.    Overall, ambiance was fun, service was great. and the food banged me in the mouth with flavor.  Innovative, delicious, and fresh.  Affordable and we will, without a doubt, be back!"}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I met for a happy hour and dinner during the week.  We saw online it had complimentary valet but had to circle the block a few times because no valet was present.  We eventually parked in a deck and walked.  Upon arrival we asked the hostess about the valet and she said no valet is there until after 6PM.  And they do no validate any parking fee.  The hostesses could have been friendlier.  They seemed busy as a large party was arriving at their upstairs, so we sat at the bar.  The bar manager was outgoing and knowledgable of the food.  We ate the flatbread and mussels which were tasty but it took a long while to get our food.  Cocktails were good but didn't seem worth the price.  Overall, not bad but could have been better."}
{"text":"Weekday work lunch - no crowd. Our server was very friendly, went over specials, and made good suggestions. During the course of the meal she was attentive and chatted us up a bit.  A bowl of mussels w large side of fries for $13 and those mussels were huge! The sauce was to Sri based but light and flavored well and had stewed tomatoes, although they were whole and probably could've been chopped up a bit. French  fries were pretty good - decent amount of dal and crunch.  My friend had the cordon bleu special and the capicola in the middle was still cold - which was odd to have such temperature difference but still flavorful. And of course he looved the French style mashed potatoes.  The decor was very interesting (see picture of ceiling) featuring local artists and the Art of War all over the ceiling. A fantastic music vibe w bands like Aerosmith.  It was absolutely freezing in there! - we were expected to hit 80 that day and I'm a small person so I'm always cold.  They change the menu seasonally and our server recommended a crab stuffed prawn w salsa verde... So I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had the 60 second NY Strip. Tough and terrible. Fries were just OK. Never again."}
{"text":"Likes: Good uptown location, amazing cocktails and fun, trendy atmosphere and decor  Gripes: Although the cocktails are amazing, the food is really not that good. It's such a popular, fun place to go with friends on a weekend night that I really wanted to like the food but it's just not good  Bottom line: I'd go for cocktails at the bar and skip the food altogether"}
{"text":"So this place earlier was some Irish pub and then they renovated and opened up as 5 Church. This swanky place is as terrible as it could be. The menu is awfully small and yet they take forever to cook the ordinary food. Do not even consider going there if you are a large group. We went as a team of 15 for lunch and while it wasn't much crowded, the servers were totally clueless and had no basic manners in treating people. The food took so long to come (just basic sandwiches and fries) that they gave the checks to everyone even before the food was out.  This is the only place I have ever paid first without even getting the food. At last the food came out and the servers once again had no idea whom to serve what. They never even apologized for late food or poor service, neither they had any smile or seemed happy to be serving. Nor did any manager came to apologize. And the quantity of the food is also really small. Their main focus is still on bar and drinks. Their bar is so big, probably that's why this terrible place is surviving as its close to all the pubs in the area and the location is right in the city center.   The awful SMALL menu, absolutely terrible service and overly decorated interiors. This is definitely one of Charlotte's worst place that looks good from outside but is absolutely terrible. I won't recommend this to anyone at all."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Charlotte. Very chic. Amazing food and fun bar scene especially on the weekends. Some of my favorite items are the black bean hummus, wasabi salmon (I could eat this every day), shrimp flatbread, local mixed greens, scallops. Even the fried tofu is beyond tasty. The smores dessert is to die for delicious. Hip and cool decor. Inventive mixed cocktails. Friendly staff. You can't go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"Dope ambiance! Good food. Great place to go to for brunch. I had the lamb burger, which was awesome."}
{"text":"Food was fine. Crab cakes were OK. Not great. Mashed potatoes were really good. Restaurant was too noisy."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for lunch and the quality  of the food has always brought me back. Today was a bit different, since I brought several out of town colleagues along, from my high recommendation.  As usual the food was excellent, however it should not take 90 minutes for lunch when we arrived at 11:45am.  The service was slightly below what I would call abonimal.  It took 10 minutes before our drink order was taken and over the whole 90 minutes I managed to eek out 1 refill of unsweet tea. As I said, the food is exceptional. My previous lunch experiences have been much better service wise, although the kitchen was slow on all occasions. If you want a conversational and delicious lunch eat here.  If you're in a hurry skip it."}
{"text":"Very cool ambiance at the bar. I will definitely go back for cocktails. Dinner was average, and it was dark and hard to hear."}
{"text":"A party of 6 for dinner last night with reservations.  We had to wait for the table and we felt as if we were in the way.  We would have gone to the bar if escorted.  We were seated upstairs and it was uncomfortably hot!  We brought two bottles of an excellent Bordeaux because it was a special occasion.  We practically had to beg to get it uncorked.  After we did finish it which was practically before our food came we were never offered the wine list.  Their loss as we easily would have drank 2 more bottles!  This is just the beginning of a bad night.  As the waitress was truly trying she was the only one!  Every one of our meals was cold.  It was not just the protein it was every component.  We tried not to complain but one member of the party had to send his plate back.  It came back to him with less protein than when it left the table.  My fries well lets just say limp and cold.  My friend asked for a Medium Rare Filet it was Blue Rare.  The two stars are for the waitress!  Not the food!  I would never recommend this place!!  I truly regret not insisting on Capital Grille!"}
{"text":"Never in my dreams would I have paired bacon with Pizza.  5Church does this, and it's awesome.  My friend and I liked it so much we ordered a second pizza. I also had a lamb burger. Great stuff."}
{"text":"Food was good although portions were small for the price.  Our server was knowledgeable with the menu and wine list, although staff seemed robotic and nervous at all times.    Heard some yelling in the kitchen which I found to be very unprofessional.  Even saw an employee get fired and escorted out the door by the bouncer.   Definitely NOT a relaxed atmosphere.   Word has gotten out that 5Church is poorly managed and I'm a witness to that fact."}
{"text":"If you stay at the Ivey's Hotel (which is otherwise excellent) this restaurant provides your room service. Our room service order was brought by a young man who stood in the doorway and shouted, \"Would you sign this please?\", and he wouldn't budge until I first signed the check. He didn't bring a copy of the check for me, the order wasn't even complete, and he simply dumped the tray on the table and quickly left without bothering to check the order or even offering to open the water bottles. The managers are totally responsible for this perfunctory service. So, you might wait about a year after this review to risk trying the room service. The characters currently mismanaging this restaurant can't last long."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal.  I was hesitant going in, mostly because everything else that's been at this location has faded quickly, but these guys have it down.  Went with a group of six and we were all very satisfied.  Appetizers - bacon pizza, black bean hummus, pork bellies and they all went real quick.    Entrees - Three of us got the grouper and agreed it was terrific.  Salmon was good, hanger steak was a little sweet for my taste but the girl that actually ordered it loved it.  Decor is awesome.  Not sure who's idea the ceiling was but that's pretty cool.  Service was absolutely spot on.  If you can get Ashley as your server do so, she didn't miss a beat.  Yeah it's not cheap but it's also not a Hardees.  Definitely feel like I got what I paid for and then some.  Great atmosphere, fantastic food, hit this place up."}
{"text":"For Thanksgiving, we decided to leave the cooking to others and was lucky to get a table at 5Church. Food was amazing, good cocktails, service was average (could have been due to the holiday), ambience and decor was very cool. Since it was Thanksgiving, it was a set menu. Soup was cauliflower, which I was a little skeptical at first, but it was very delicious. Salad was a butter lettuce -very basic. We did have a choice of main and desserts. Our party of 4 all had turkey with the fixings and it was delicious. More than enough food, I actually had leftovers. As for the desserts, we each tried a different one and they were all scrumptious. Will definitely go back to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"We come here all the time for brunch and it is always amazing. We stopped in for a late night dinner and ordered off the snack menu. The shrimp flatbread was amazing and had tons of flavor. The pork belly was over cooked and the chicken lettuce  wraps had an overwhelming Rosemary flavor. If we go back late night we would stick to flatbreads only."}
{"text":"Well, I have to say I was sorely disappointed! All the hype about 5Church is nothing but hype, most likely generated by their own marketing manager who also happens to be part owner, or at least that's the way it looks on their site. Some people are easily swayed I guess. My experience was that it was a garish, loud and unpleasant atmosphere. You can tell they are trying way too hard to be hip. The food was so so, my lamb burger was dry and tasteless yet greasy at the same time. This is just another bar in uptown, not a real restaurant. There are a few small locally owned places that are within a block or two that are much more appealing if you want some good food and drink without all the hype and noise. Nothing worth returning for here."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a long day of travel - service was awful and food not great. Took waitress over 15 minutes to take our drink order.....then order was wrong. she spent the entire time apologizing in an awkward, annoying way...not in a way that helps you forget a little mistake. Ouch."}
{"text":"I originally gave this place 2 stars based on my first experience: poor service & below average meal were the reason. Someone from their HR department reached out to me apologizing for my experience. I really appreciated that. Most places would not have taken the time, so it shows that they actually care about their customer's opinions. I decided to chalk my first time up to an 'off day' on their part and went back for a second time. I kept an open mind and was very pleasantly surprised. My meal was DELICIOUS. I had the breakfast pizza (can't remember the exact name). I brought along 2 friends of mine and they really enjoyed their meals, as well. We ordered the bottomless mimosas and they were awesome! The wait staff was great! Our mimosas never got below a half of a glass and they were very attentive and friendly. What a COMPLETELY different experience compared to the first time I went here! I'm glad I went back and I will definitely eat here again in the future!"}
{"text":"A small group of us headed out for lunch today, and upon getting to our preferred restaurant, Basil, found they had a 30 minute wait to be seated. 5Church didn't have a wait, so we figured we would try eating there instead, since several of us had meetings after lunch. In retrospect, the lack of a wait should have been a clue.  We were sat immediately, and the server took our orders fairly quickly. The lunch menu is slim: sandwiches, flat breads and salads. Honestly, nothing that can't be thrown together with 5 minutes of time and a fryolator. One person ordered a salad, the rest of us ordered sandwiches, which according to the posterboard outside, came with fries and a drink for $10. (Our server never inquired if we wanted drinks, by the way. You got water only unless you asked for a drink specifically.)  Our orders were taken around 12:15. At 12:50, after seeing several tables that had been sat after us receive their orders, I finally inquired when we saw our server, who had been MIA for a long while, with runners delivering to his one or two tables. (One table sat down after us, got their meal, and left, before we even got our meal.)  My inquiry was far more polite than the curses some members of our table had lobbed into our discussion about the restaurant and our MIA server in particular after seeing everyone BUT US served in the 30+ minutes we had to wait for our pedestrian, easily-assembled sandwiches and fries.  Frankly, I couldn't blame my tablemates, many of whom had better places to be than sitting idly at the table of a missing-in-action incompetent server in an inefficient restaurant. Honestly, I was the least pissed off of all the diners, so I was the one to ask about our food, in the most polite, non-assertive manner I could muster - because to do so otherwise would invite spit from this type of place and our \"Hack\" server. Unlike half of my tablemates, I didn't have somewhere else to be an hour after I left for lunch (i.e @1:00).  My exact words when our MIA server finally decided to grace us with his presence were, \"Hi, can you check on our order? Several of us have meetings we need to get to in a few minutes.\"   As soon as the words left my mouth, our aptly-named server \"Hack\" (according to my receipt) seemed deeply offended that we had the damned AUDACITY to inquire about food that took way too long for a business lunch.   Our server \"Hack\" stiffened and adopted a defensive and rude demeanor. \"As you can see, we're very busy!\" he huffed pompously.   Seriously?! Drop the attitude, sweetheart. You don't work at e2e or Blue and only one other table has been sat in your area in the last 30 minutes. Sorry, but 5Church isn't on par with Charlotte's classy or high volume restaurants like say, Basil, which actually had a wait - and clearly for a good reason.   \"Your food is coming out soon!\" he snapped nastily, as he trounced off.  Our food finally arrived about 5 minutes later, and soon after that a soda glass was wordlessly slammed down next to me, presumably to replace my drink that had been emptied while our waiter had been MIA for so long.We asked for our checks, which arrived after about ten minutes. Hardly prompt, but it was better than I expected from our \"Hack\" server.  The food was okay. The fries were overdone, but my sandwich was okay. We scarfed down our food and got out of there as quickly as possible. 5Church had way overstayed its welcome for those of us who had other things to do.  I'd seriously recommend you avoid 5Church during the day if you have any other plans after your lunch, or if you want a professional server. The food was okay but the unprofessional service was galling. \"Hack\" was a certainly an appropriate name for our server. We won't return. This location doesn't seem to ever hold a successful restaurant, and with this kind of service, 5Church seems to be yet another failure just working its way on through."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's going on with the decor here. It's sort of gothic and kind of trendy, but mainly just weird. We were looking for a trendy and romantic spot to celebrate my bf's birthday, but the restaurant was loud and full of groups from a conference.  The food was good, but not particularly memorable. We started with the shrimp flatbread, I had the roasted chicken at the recommendation of the server (it was fine), and my bf had the filet (he was very happy with it). Our server also recommended the viper cocktail which sounded awesome, but was actually a bit boring. We ended our meal with the smores dessert, a very sweet brownie with marshmallow fluff on top...so not smores at all, but still good.  I love that they have a bunch of local brews on tap and hear that they have bottomless mimosas at brunch. I will definitely give it a try for brunch, but may not be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Great spot for a date, girls night or drinks!  I go all the time, love the food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"5 church is one of my favorite restaurants in the Charlotte area, along with numerous friends. I've never been disappointed by the food or drinks here."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Great weekend hangout -however all 4 times I have eaten here the service was beyond awful every time."}
{"text":"Had a great experience there last night. Design and atmosphere was perfect for a special dinner. Server was exceptional. Food was great- as to be expected. However the new fall menu fell short in creativity and seasonal influence. Just my opinion though. Enjoy your dinner!"}
{"text":"We had drinks there the other night and I was disappointed. It seems the place has gotten just a little bit full of itself. The bartenders were actually walking with their tennis shoes where they stack the fresh glasses. The bottles were high up and they had no ladder.  Disgusting.  Also my martini was finished and empty for ten minutes and finally had to wave to get another.  Not a big deal but they are in the big leagues.   And charge a lot for a little."}
{"text":"I've been to 5Church a few times. It's usually really good. We went to brunch for Father's Day. I was disappointed when I was told that they were not having the buffet because not as many reservations were made for Father's Day as Mother's Day.   I had the shrimp and grits. It was bland and needed salt and pepper. The grits looked and tasted more like risotto. My son had the steak and it was tough. The potatoes and fries were good. I'm not giving up on them yet, but Father's Day deserves the  same respect and buffet as mothers day."}
{"text":"What words come to mind when describing 5Church? Well, maybe... Hot, Chic, Artsy, Delicious, Fashionable, Trendy, Modern, Funky, Sexy, Elegant, and seemingly a little bit ahead of the curve for Charlotte. After opening what seems to be the largest doors in the world... we were promptly greeted by a 5Church hostess and got our seats within seconds.  An attention to detail, art and design runs rampant throughout the restaurant. After a slightly lengthy wait... we were finally brought a basket of slightly salted bread. Crispy and salty on the outside, fluffy and delicious on the inside. The crispy Szechuan pork belly and spicy cabbage came out next and was one of the best things we had for the night. The pork belly was nice and crispy, without being too fatty. The cabbage had the perfect crunch and acidity to balance the pork belly. The biggest draw back... there were only a couple bites of the pork belly :(  Ella started her meal with the Tomato soup with aged cheese and crouton. The soup was pretty good, but she's had better. What we did really like was the crunchy cheesy crouton that added a nice texture to the soup. The bacon pizza came topped with shaved vidalia onion and fromage blanc.. or in lamens terms, white cheese. This was a pretty good pizza for being an app, I don't think I would recommend it be anyone's entree because its pretty thin and not very filling.  The best plate of the night was the C.A.B. hanger steak with roasted potatoes, marinated tomato salad, and J-1 sauce. In case you're wondering what C.A.B. is, its \"Certified Angus Beef\". The steak was cooked perfectly and rubbed with an awesome blend of spices that added a mountain of bold flavors, especially with the J-1 sauce. The steak was served with crispy roasted potatoes which were really tasty, especially with the J-1 sauce, I could have done without the marinated tomato but it was pretty good with the   J-1 sauce... oh yeah and the J-1 Sauce was pretty good too :)  The 5Church lamb burger with grilled onion marmalade, gorgonzola cheese and arugala came stuffed between a house-made sesame bun and served with a crispy confit potato. Coming in just barely as a strong third, the lamb burger was juicy, fresh, and a little bit of eye fluttering / toe curling deliciousness. The crispy confit potato sticks made for a cute start to a log cabin but might have been better (for me) if they weren't so \"log like\" and more fry like. Its not that I don't appreciate the originality.. its just that the best part (for me) is the crispy exterior, not the squishy potato interior. The smaller the fry the more crispy and less squishy there is :)  The chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and cherries was not on the menu, but probably will be soon because it was delicious. The cake was super moist and topped with gooey rich chocolate glaze and cooked cherries. The ice cream (which i am pretty sure was home made) was the perfect addition to the rich chocolate cake and made for a great dessert. The smores trifle was on point and looked delicious but the depth of the cup made for a difficult mixture of equal flavors. Each bite was either too chocolatey, too marshmallowy, or too graham crackery.. even if none of those are real words you get the point.  5Church left a memorable impression on us and we definitely recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited 5 Church for the first time for lunch on a Friday.  This may have been our first but will not be our last.   When you walk in the large glass front door, you can't help but look around in amazement.  The décor is beautiful!  Look up on the ceiling and you'll even find art.  A local artist painted/wrote the words to a novel on the ceiling (plus a few small hidden words/phrases special to 5 Church).  So cool!!  My husband had the lamb burger and absolutely loved it (I tried it too and have to agree).  I had the fried chicken sandwich which was not a normal boring chicken sandwich.  As sides, we couldn't decide so we got three: chickpea salad, hand cut fries, and something we had no idea about, quinoa tebouleh (which came highly recommended by our server...it did not disappoint).  The entire meal was start to finish (including a few adult beverages) was great.  We highly recommend and can't wait to get back for brunch (drooled over the menu) or dinner!"}
{"text":"5Church has always been one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte for it's great food and atmosphere.  It's the caliber of a high end steak house without the formality that most have.  Their NY strip steak is one of a kind and I highly recommend it.  Their cocktails are also fun - I had the shot in the dark and it's fresh, fruity, but not overly sweet. My boyfriend and I decided to celebrate there and the staff went above and beyond to make me feel special. Their dessert is out of this world -- highly recommend the smores truffle brownie (or something like that).  It's everything you could want in a dessert -- and I usually do not like desserts. I will definitely return to celebrate other life moments, but also for those just because moments!"}
{"text":"5Church was definitely the highlight of my recent (very rainy) trip to Charlotte-especially since it's Open Table friendly. Not only was the service eccentric and down to earth, but the staff was extremely constructive on recommending dishes as well as my cocktail decision for the night (the Viper=awesome).   The atmosphere was very swanky and filled with mid to late twenty somethings. Perfect place to graze before a night out, have a pleasant intimate dinner, or just to get dressy with some girlfriends. The menu is straightforward Americana and is extremely reasonable for those of us on a budget.   Favorite dishes:  -The House Cured Charcuterie Board - as odd as it sounds, the Pâté was the star of the bunch -Braised Beef Short Rib - perfectly cut portions that fell down from heaven and onto your plate; it's also large enough to split into two!  -Crispy Beet Sliders - sounds a little weird, but these scrumptious two biters are perfect for those who are not meat lovers (and even those of us who are!)  Overall, this twenty something gives this an A."}
{"text":"Come for the LAMB BURGER which is AMAZING.  Nothing else.  The duck confit \"pierogis\" are not pierogi (and there was only 1).  I can't even remember what my husband ate, it was that unmemorable."}
{"text":"Best way to describe 5 Church is that it has gotten too big for it's britches. Upon arriving I went to the ladies room and the lock fell out of it's screws and onto the floor. Bar scene and bartender both solid. Received drinks quickly while waiting for a table. We were sat promptly and greeted shortly thereafter. Our waitress described the portions of the appetizers and quickly ran off. We ordered artisanal cheeses and calamari. Calamari was decent but did not come with any cocktail type sauce only a tasteless mayonnaise and the \"artisanal cheeses\" were laughable with 4 olives, a few apple slices, untoasted baguette slices and soft cheeses all tasting the same. The waitress most confused me though when she came back and asked at least 3 times very abruptly, do you know what you want to order, without giving any specials or recommendations on entrees. If I'm paying over $30 for an entree....I'd like to be at least warmed up on a couple options. Finally I asked her for some recommendations and she basically tried to up sell us on adding crab cakes or scallops to our entrees. I ordered the scallops, why would I want to add a scallop? Shortly thereafter a manager looking lady came to help bus the table. Maybe our waitress was overwhelmed, but it felt like the place is just trying to get you in & out and squeeze you for as much $ as possible, while lacking quality."}
{"text":"My best friend and I came for the last night of restaurant week and could not have been more satisfied. Michelle our server was awesome and gave us perfect recommendations. Everything was delicious and we didn't feel rushed. I take my family here every time they are in town and never have any complaints. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My girls and I had a really nice experience at 5Church today for their Thanksgiving meal. Our waiter was very sweet and knowledgeable. One of my daughters has celiac and I have had a chef at an upscale restaurant be really awful about it, but they were so nice and helped her decide what to order and made suggestions. (I'm not one of those awful people who asks for special accommodations I just need to know what she's eating!) Just wanted to give a shout out to everyone at 5Church! Thanks for an incredible meal!!"}
{"text":"Unfriendly hostess resulted in poor first impression. We arrived on a Thursday at 4:50. We planned to have a drink while waiting for coworkers to join us. The first thing the hostess said to us was, \"the kitchen doesn't open for 10 minutes.\" - We didn't ask about the kitchen or placing an order.  The hostess led us to a small table and added a chair to the end of it to accommodate our party of 5.  We asked if we could be seated at a booth since the restaurant was empty and we were the only customers. Hostess informed us the booths were being held for those who made reservations. We were there from 4:50-7:30pm. During that time, several booths remained empty. We ordered appetizers and dinner. I would give the food a 5/10.  It was a little pricey but didn't meet expectations. The only positive about 5Church is the decor. The decor is trendy and inviting. I wouldn't recommend eating here but it is a nice atmosphere for Happy Hour. I don't think we will be returning after the cold reception and mediocre food. There are much better options uptown."}
{"text":"Co-workers raved about this place and their signature 60 second steak so we met there for dinner during a recent business trip.   The place is stylish and cozy with lots of interesting things to look at, including the patrons.  The cocktails were pricey but delicious.  We tried a few apps while at the bar waiting for our table - the lobster claw which was literally two bites of lobster for $17 - the sauce was interesting but totally not worth the price - and the meatball, which was very good.  Once seated we ordered dinner - I tried the 60 second steak - which is supposedly the dish that got the chef his job, but didn't impress me one bit.  Seared on one side and totally uncooked on the other, my steak was like cutting into shoe leather on the cooked side and basically flavorless.  We also ordered a few sides, probably the brussels and yukon potatoes but I honestly don't remember them.    Overall a 60 second experience for me and one I probably won't repeat anytime soon."}
{"text":"I liked this trendy little bar that is nicely decorated, (don't forget to look at the ceiling), and serves up decent food.  We went in for the $10 lunch that includes an entree and a non-alcoholic beverage for the price.  It was a pretty good deal.  I, however, went for something with whiskey in it.  In their offerings for lunch, they have Beet Sliders that are pretty good, but they are served up with skinny fries that looked like they'd been out of the freezer too long before they were cooked.  All in all, we enjoyed the experience, we enjoyed the food, and we like the server except that she forgot to bring the iced tea we ordered.  Ooops!"}
{"text":"Not going back.  This place is way over-hyped.  When we arrived we were promptly seated upstairs.  The atmosphere is really interesting and fun.  We were seated at a table barely large enough for a couple of plates.  And, we were seated next to another couple whose table was less than 6 inches from ours.  This may not have been an issue except that we were two of only about eight customers in the entire place (about 6pm on Friday).  Our appetizers were good.  We ordered the mixed salad, quinoa tabouleh, and beet slider.  Again, all tasty.  We also ordered a couple of beers and were promptly told they were out but they had a replacement.  So, we ordered the replacement only to find out the beer was twice as expensive.  Five beers, $40.    Our main course was NOT GOOD.  It tasted like salt had been molded into various shapes and colors.  We ordered the Terriaki Tofu and don't recommend it.  This was our first visit so I'm not sure if all the main courses are this salty.  But ours was bordering on inedible.  Again, we were seated right on top of neighboring customers so we were eager to pay our bill and go have a drink or two down at the bar.  I had a full beer remaining from dinner and took it with me.  We got to the bar and my wife ordered a drink.  We finished our drinks and attempted to flag down a bartender for nearly 20 minutes before we got their attention.  When the bill arrived, they charged me again for the beer I brought down from dinner.  I told them I had already paid for that drink.  One of the bar tenders gave me a dirty look and spoke to two other bar tenders.  I guess they were \"investigating\" the issue.  Anyway, 15 minutes later, a manager adjusted our bill.  It was really nice being treated like we were trying to get away with something.  Long story short.  This place is average at best, service is hit and miss, and with the number of other great places in town, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  This place is cool in an upscale hipster kinda way.   I had the lamb burger the first time and the Duck the second. The duck was ok and if memory serves me well so was the lamb burger. The wine list is quite impressive and the cheese plate is one of the better selections in the city.   Ok so - 4 stars because the food and the service are great.  No 5 star rating because for the price I wasn't blown away either time. I left on both occasions not really caring if we ever returned. Beyond that if you are already in that part of town the Dandelion Market easily wins out over 5church."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here on 2/24/14 and had an unbelievable experience. Manager gave us personal service, waiter Doug was awesome. Food was great couldn't have asked for more. Highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor. Good food. Horrible service. I only wish I could remember our waitresses name.  My sister had her bachelorette party here and we were seated in a nice large booth in the back. She is not a loud person and no one would have even known we were celebrating. Before long we were asked to move! I mean within 15 minutes of arriving and still waiting for other guests to arrive. We had to squeeze in way too close to one another so they could take away a table and seat 3 other people who came in after us. It was awkward and uncomfortable to be packed that close together. My water glass was never refilled. It was empty more than half of the night. She pressured us into ordering right away. As soon as one friend sat down she was waiting to take her cocktail order and the friend asked twice for time to look over the menu. She didn't give us much time to look over the menu but continued to press everyone to order. So, she was hovering around waiting to take the food order but when it comes to refilling water, god forbid we have anything to drink...I had to pile up everyones bread plates, appetizers, bread basket on my side, even after we were through with our meals because our server never came to take away the plates. I had to ask her to please take away the empty dishes so my sister had room to open her gifts. As she was handed the first present, the waitress came over and asked how to split the bill making my sister wait. The friend who organized the party said to put \"her's\" and pointed to my sister, on he bill. The waitress rudely responded \"Who's \"her\"?\". and the friend had to point to my sister again. When my sister was about to open the last gift the waitress came back and passed out the bills, not even bothering to say excuse me or maybe wait until my sister is obviously done, but everyone had to fumble around with their money during the time my sister was supposed to be able to enjoy fun gifts. We felt so unwelcome that we just got up and sat around the couches in the front for 30 minutes until our reservation at Crave. I noticed the other tables were waited on properly and I was disgusted with this horrible experience. Our waitress, an african american lady with black and brown hair (she was also wearing red lipstick) made this is a bad experience and my sister and her friends deserve better. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I'm a big 5Church fan. Their polenta is amazing. In fact, I love just about everything on their brunch menu. Sitting at the bar is a great atmosphere as all of their bartenders are so friendly and talkative. I love hanging out here."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here twice for dinner in the past year, and been very impressed with the food both times.  Apps, entrees and desserts were all delicious, and the wine list is above average.  I will say though, 5Church has somehow earned the reputation of \"a place to be seen in Charlotte,\" and I think that attitude among the servers and other patrons may detract a bit from the restaurant overall.  The servers take the \"hipster\" vibe just a bit too far, and I cannot find words to describe the outfits women wear to this place; honestly, it's ridiculous.  If you are looking for good food uptown, you will find it here.  Just be prepared to look past the \"We wish we were in Manhattan or LA\" vibe from everyone else in the building."}
{"text":"Apart from the decor and atmosphere, I don't see what all the hype is about.  Went here the first night of restaurant week and the food, at best, was mediocre.  The pork belly spring rolls were tasty, but nowhere near \"phenomenal\" as the waitress described. The seared scallops were over salted and gave me heartburn. The best part of the meal was the chocolate pretzel bar for dessert - perfect balance of salt and sweet, bit not overtly sweet."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd experience at 5Church. I haven't been here in a few years.  However my first experience was good.  My husband and I decided to celebrate a late Valentine's dinner here on Saturday evening.  This was not the food nor service that I remembered.  We ordered the beet salad and tuna tarter to start.  The beet salad was an extremely small portion and lacked flavor.  We both felt the tuna tarter was the best choice of the night.  My husband ordered the filet and it was cooked to his liking; but nothing special.  I ordered the deckle steak cooked medium well, which was served nearly rare. Our server sent the steak back and returned with the steak nearly exact to how it came to our table initially.  It was uneatable. To top it off, with just 2 small starters, 2 steaks, and 4 drinks our bill totaled over $200.  We left hungry and extremely unsatisfied."}
{"text":"A few of the negative comments I've heard about this place all relate to the trout and yet for some reason I still ordered it and I coudln't agree more.  The trout is not fresh and very disappointing given that everything else was excellent."}
{"text":"The decor is very on trend. It was obviously a popular hangout but it was nice that it didn't feel crowded or overly noisy. The food was tasty. I started with the cauliflower soup which was exceptional. Typically not a fan of brussel sprouts but these with bacon which was also exceptional. The creamed spinach was tasty as well, however it was over salted. Typically not one who orders steak but I decided to this time. Perfectly cooked but like the spinach, over salted. The smore dessert was out of this world and could easily have had 2nds or 3rds. What really made this experience was the wait staff. We were a group of about 20 last night and had two young men assigned to our table. They were on top of their game and really made it an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. Excellent service. Very friendly and great comfort food."}
{"text":"The service ruined the meal here. Unfortunately the waiter neglected to tell me they were out of the dish I or ended until 20 or 30 minutes after I ordered it. When my second choice arrived it was very good, however. The interior is modern and pleasant and the food is interesting.  All in all, I think there are better choices in uptown at the same price point."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant from floor to ceiling. The finishes are very cool.  We had a reservation through open table for Sunday Brunch and were seated immediately. Then we waited a ridiculous amount of time for coffee and our food. The presentation of the food is wonderful but the actual flavors were not great.  The combination of the wait and kind of bland food made this a disappointing experience. I would definitely go for drinks and enjoy the beautiful decor."}
{"text":"First, the atmosphere is awesome. If you only came to sit at the bar to have a drink, you'd be pretty happy.   We were lucky enough to sit for dinner and enjoy several of the menu's delicious offerings.   Our small party of 3 ordered several appetizers to share.  We started with the Bibb wedge, which the kitchen kindly split on 3 plates. This salad is fantastic! It's not has heavy as many other wedge salads we have had.   Next up was the octopus, poke and mussels. While the octopus wasn't our favorite, it wasn't bad and the poke made up for what the octopus lacked. The poke was fresh and had the perfect flavoring.   We finished with the wild mushroom flatbread. Wow! We loved this so much that we ordered a second one.   We washed all of this down with more than our fair share of Vipers, their signature cocktail."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for Sunday brunch after making a reservation. We walked in and were seated right away which was nice and the place was not full. The menu has a wide selection of brunch items to choose from and I had a hard time making my decision! I ended up ordering the Irish Breakfast and although the food was good (not great) the poor service ruined the experience for us. Our waitress hardly ever came over to our table to check on us and we had to ask why our food was taking so long instead of her apologizing. It took almost an hour for us to get our food and when it was brought to the table they forgot part of my order. The manager even stopped by towards the end of our meal to ask how everything was but did not seem apologetic about the poor service. I really enjoyed the atmosphere however the lack of service and extended wait for our food caused us to be unhappy with the visit. I probably would not go back to this place but it may be worth a visit if you get better service than we did."}
{"text":"Visiting my sister, with my wife, and we read the reviews on Yelp! and decided it looked and sounded too good to miss out on.  Pork Chops, Pork Chops, Pork Chops!  Were outstanding.  Mushroom ravioli, small plate, super delicious.  \"60 Second\" NY Strip Steak, was one of the best steaks we've ever tasted.  Grouper was really flaky, and moist.  Tomato soup, was tangy, and more on the bisque side, and the crouton was buttery goodness.  We sat in a really fun area, it was kind of a private small landing up the stairs."}
{"text":"I read about this place on Yelp, and stopped in for lunch before my flight home from Charlotte.  It's a trendy place with very nice decor.  Carrie the bartender was super cool, and the hostess was also very helpful & friendly.  I order the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich.  It was very good.  The bun was toasted, but at the same time very soft.  The chicken was cooked perfectly... inside was moist and juicy with a good batter.  It was topped with wicked pickles and aioli which had a tangy bite.  Their seasonal side was green beans... disappointed.  They were simple green beans with some onions, small portion and costs $4.  Next time I will go with the black bean humus."}
{"text":"I went to 5Church for brunch this past Sunday with a group of 5. The service was decent, and the food was even better. The decor of 5Church was gorgeous and I loved the mimosas. One thing I would've liked was the server to have come to the table more to check on my empty mimosa glass at times."}
{"text":"Not sure how or why this place got 4.5 stars. I feel the menu is too limited and the selections aren't diverse enough.  That said, my food was good. I had the shrimp and Boursin flatbread with a side of the broccoli with garlic and red pepper flakes. My guest had the turkey sandwich, which she said was good, and fries, which were served in a bowl and were very soggy.   The decor is interesting and hip (this might be a fun place for happy hour) but service seemed slow, even though there weren't many people there for lunch.  I'd probably give them another shot, but they need to step up their game to compete in the very crowded Uptown CLT restaurant scene."}
{"text":"The food here has never disappointed. There is a reason the menu is a little pricier than usual and it's because the food and drinks are phenomenal. The ambiance too really is ideal for a wonderful dinner before a night out with friends. The menu isn't huge, but has everything from a light snack to a heavy dinner which I LOVE! If you haven't been, I highly recommend. It is by far me and my friends favorite place in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere of this location. Overall I think the cocktails were beautifully presented and tasted great, and the server took time to understand my needs of what I wanted in my drink and modified my choice accordingly so it wasn't too sweet. We split a handful of apps, and a couple were good but nothing too outrageously special but I was a huge huge fan of the Tuna Takaki. Go here with friends and enjoy apps and cocktails and even their great list of daily specials and regular items. Everything looks good and would be a great date night spot as well!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a tremendous place to enjoy dinner. The atmosphere was ideal for a slow and leisure dinner. Of particular note was the Charred Octopus appetizer. It was amazingly delicious and I'd encourage everyone to give it a try as this is not your mother's chewy octopus. I was disappointed by the S'mores Trifle dessert which was a basic brownie and Jet-Puffed marshmallow toasted by a butane-flame. Also, my wife spoke highly about the Caramelized Sweet Potatoes so give them a try as well."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for restaurant week. Overall, it was good but I'm not sure I would come back to sit down and eat - the crowd that was there for drinks and apps seemed to be having a better time."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in the door the staff there was so nice.  Doug, our server gave wonderful food and drink recommendations and was very attentive. The food was AMAZING, I loved the roasted corn soup."}
{"text":"I REALLY want to love 5church. I've been twice and wasn't a huge fan of my meal either time. However the atmosphere is amazing and it is a GORGEOUS restaurant. Also the 5Church signature cocktail is the best cocktail I've ever had. Definitely will be back in the future in hopes of finding something on the menu I love"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch yesterday and I thought the food was pretty good. Highly recommend the Crab cakes and poached eggs. The sangria at $2.50 a glass is hard to beat. However, the Bloody Mary comes in a short glass and was not my favorite. Overall atmosphere is great and decor is beautiful! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I moved to Charlotte about 5 months ago and heard so much about 5 Church. I went with my girlfriend to sit at the bar, have a great dinner, drinks and caught up with each other. My friend was able to find seats at the bar on a Saturday night so I was pretty excited. i joined my friend and we started talking. The bartender (Brian G) walked by me multiple times without recognition until I called out to him for a water and a menu. He gave me a water and by that time my friends drink was brinking empty...you would think Brian would ask if she would like another after setting down my water but to my surprise he walked away. Brian seemed to be down with the servers the majority of time laughing; so when he walked by again I asked him if we could order. Now meanwhile I am trying to catch up with my friend but have to keep tabs on where Brian is so that we can get what we need. I also want to mention that the bar was not busy so that can not be an excuse. I was not pleased to say the least but loved my meal. My friend and I have been back multiple times despite the bad service. We sat in the cocktail area and had a much more pleasant experience.  We just went back late last week and had to sit at the bar because it was busy in the cocktail area. Once again Brian was our bartender but there was also a girl behind the bar so I was looking forward to having someone new, hoping for a better experience. My friend got there first and she already had a drink so once again I knew I was going to have watch for Brian just to get a drink unless the girl came up to us. We did get Brian. He gave my friend a menu but after setting down my water he started walking away. I had to say to him before you leave could you please provide me with a menu, I mean come on! Then as per usual we had to track him down for refills, wanting to order, your check, ect. I thought maybe it was just us but as my friend and I started watching, the other patrons would have their food dropped off and he just left. Or get their drink and have to ask for menu or get their drink and are ready to order but he never even asks. I wonder if he knows his job description. They had to wait for him to walk back by to ask for condiments or anything else. Then you see the other bartender on her phone texting away while the customers are having a bad experience. My friend and I were getting livid. The icing on the cake for me was when I finally mentioned that it was like an icebox in here and I was so cold, was there any way to turn the air up. Immediately without any hesitation he blurts out \"No\". Are you serious? At least pretend you are asking or trying to get it a more pleasant temperature...he can not even do that. To top it off, you would think his personality would be great being a bartender. he is very shjort and to be honest seems very cocky. My friend and I left there saying we will never go back unless we are craving the duck or scallops....and we will ALWAYS be sitting in the cocktail bar area and NEVER at the bar again. My suggestion to you is to try this restaurant because the food is good but please do not sit at the bar...you will be there a long time to get what you want!"}
{"text":"This was mediocre at best. The food was good but nothing memorable. The service was good too. However do NOT make a reservation here. They give you a bar table! They said that was their \"reservation table\" which seems like a joke to me. Also the place is very noisy which is fine for appetizers and drinks but not for a nice dinner. I will probably not come back here again unless it's for cocktails."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in the door you feel like you might be in NYC as opposed to NC. The décor and energy are both great. Modern industrial with very unique lighting fixtures, a bit of a brocade vibe and the entire novel \"The Art of War\" is written in chalk on the ceiling- assumingly to not be outdone by Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel.   Service was good. And the food impressive, depending on what you got. So choose wisely. Here's a list to help you do just that...  First, the starters. Skip the jerk chicken lettuce wraps. They do not live up to their Jamaican roots. The wedge salad is a solid good. But the perogies were my favorite. Nothing was sensational, however, just yet.  But the lamb burger, now that's a different story. So well seasoned with a complex blend of herbs and spices. The cheese. The bun. It was excellent. The fries were also pretty great, but less fry-like and more like a 2x4 of potato. And the sauce they give you to dip them in is a beautiful aioli of flavors. I put it on my burger too.  As for dessert, completely skip the Peanut Butter cake. Not worth it. And the Banana Pudding is just okay. But the S'More- ohh the s'more.  It's campfire heaven in a glass.  So, 5 Church gets 3 stars. A touch hit and miss, with a slight edge going to the hits."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, and excellent ambiance. Had the tuna tartare, wasabi crusted salmon, and the coconut lime mousse. The tartare and the salmon were fantastic, and the mousse was pretty good. Service was great. Unquestionably five star experience."}
{"text":"Sorry for the rating as there's no way for me to remark without really able t try their food. I went on yelp to look for a place to eat before we went to a meeting close by.  Seeing a few good comments as well the place said open till 2 am, I was excited as we will have a place to eat late. As we were late for the reservation we made, we decided to first go to meeting that we could not miss then go back to eat since it said it open till 2 am. The reality is not.  The bar opens till 2 am but the kitchen closed early.  I ended starving and I had to find somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great food, a couple hiccups with the service, but the staff definitely made up for it in the end. Went here to celebrate my husbands birthday; they acknowledged it with a card and coupon for 10% off the next visit. This place was trendy with a slightly hipster vibe. We had the szechuan pork belly snack which was delicious. Complimentary focaccia bread was good. I ordered a wedge salad and the wasabi encrusted salmon while my hubby ordered the \"chefs special\" 60 second steak. The entrees came out with no hint of my salad, and our waiter noticed and got it sent out compliments of the house. My husband's steak also came out without a knife, and when my salad came out finally, it lacked one also. However, the food was delicious! We also got the Smores dessert, which also was comped for the birthday! That was unexpected, and it was tasty to boot."}
{"text":"If you're coming for drinks or a rehearsal dinner, this place is great.   If you're coming for a regular dinner, look elsewhere.  I've been to rehearsal dinners and to get drinks and the experience was so good I decided to book our anniversary dinner there. I was severely disappointed.   I booked it well in advance with the note that it was for our anniversary. We were sat in between two loud, drunk parties, one being a bachelorette party. First strike.  Our mussels were bad and were amongst the worst we've ever had. Strike 2.  I ordered a $50 Ribeye medium rare. It shows up charred and brown completely through. It took so long to get there and at that point we were already over it."}
{"text":"I love eating brunch here, my first time was their first brunch and I couldn't wait to come back, they have this pizza with eggs on it that is to die for! I've had a few meals here and I always get the special that they have for the night, I have never returned anything and have cleared my plate! The bar tenders are awesome, and the staff is great and friendly! Only thing is I wish outside seating was an option but that's something that I don't think can happen with the location, and honestly the inside of this place is almost as appealing as the food. The owners are fantastic and I've met them a few times. I always walk by here on my way home and see the cooks getting everything ready and I must say you are all terrific!"}
{"text":"The interior, menu, atmosphere was up to par. But the food was not. I was really looking forward to a great brunch, but what I got was mediocre. The Belgium waffles were literally just waffles and syrup that I could have made at home. The restaurant itself has a cool vibe, but the food isn't worth it. I would go back for a $2.50 mimosa or sangria at the bar, but that's about all"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and the most recent was when Top Chef Katsuji visited. The service is good at dinner, but can be slow at lunch.  Jamie did not visit our table but visited lots of others, but Katsuji was nice enough to stop by and take a picture.  The food has been consistently good. Katsuji made the tongue mole, which was the favorite of the night. We also ordered the ahi tuna, chicken adobo and the sea scallops. I also recommend this place to get a drink at night."}
{"text":"Ambiance is nice and drinks are still good (but overpriced). Service is excellent. My downgraded review is due solely to the lack of variety for vegetarian options. While the other meat entrees change over time, there has only ever been one vegetarian entree since 5Church opened: kimchi tofu. And it's not good at all.   PLEASE offer a new vegetarian entree!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good I wouldn't say great but it's the type of place that is trying to push class yet the people have none. The staff does though . Also good on a sat night to find older women"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal at 5Church for restaurant week! I had the scallops with citrus sauce that was amazing! The app of pork belly spring rolls was delicious with a tangy sauce. The dessert was a deconstructed chocolate mousse, sort of like a mousse but arranged in bits, crust, sauce & cream--across the plate. The scallops were my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all!!   Sat at the bar for dinner.   5 bartenders and not one if them knew specials.  Vim style stood around and complained to each other.     The only time they were attentive was when it was time to pay.     Food is ok..  Far better choices in Charlotte...  My advice... Skip it.."}
{"text":"I love the food here. I tried several of the items from the yelp event that was held on their opening and the mini crab cakes with quail eggs were GREAT! The sliders were also delicious as well and I went back to have a happy hour cocktail with a side of humas and it was fantastic as well.   The interior of this place is decorated in a very upscale manner and it for sure isn't a jeans and t-shirt type dining experience. As you enter there is a impressive wall of wine over the bar to the left and they have several tiers of seating areas throughout the restaurant. I hope they do well as they are located at the corner of 5th street and north church which, for whatever reason, seems to be a bit of a cursed spot for businesses in Charlotte.   The one downside is that the prices are a bit on the high side. They seem to have tried to price the menu out reasonably for the on-the-go downtown lunch crowd but dinner tops off at 20-30 a plate before you get into wine and drinks. But there again, the food is awesome so if you are looking to treat yourself to a great meal on a night out this would be the place to stop in."}
{"text":"Read the other reviews. Came with 4 kids and 4 adults for brunch .... Server was nice but extremely slow....food was ok. Best things where the fries and the donuts. We ordered 5 entrees to split. She messed up on the order... Food was well put together  but one note. Best was the lamb burger. Others where just ok and not hot. Suggest for the scene not for the service of food"}
{"text":"I indicated that it was my birthday when I made the reservation. My mother also let the server Gabriel know that it was my birthday and all we got was a half smile. I watched as Gabriel checked on the two tables behind us to only walk by us after. At the end of the meal, after we paid, was when he finally acknowledged my birthday. If the restaurant does anything for birthday's I didn't receive it.   The food left a lot to be desired. I was excited to have brunch here having had a previously great experience for dinner with friends. I won't be returning. Diner style food at twice the price. The mimosas are cheap but so is the champagne and fake orange juice they use.   I should have had my birthday breakfast elsewhere ...   Visited 12/17/17"}
{"text":"A group of us girls reserved the room upstairs to celebrate one of our colleagues going away party. Upon entering the restaurant we all commented on the inviting ambiance and eclectic decor. We were quite pleased with our choice! Our waitress, Alyssa, was cordial enough as we settled in for dinner and cocktails. All was going well until the end of the evening.That's when a chain of events began that left me running out the door, never to return again... and prompting this review. One of my employees had excused herself to visit the ladies room. Upon her return she mentioned that the floors were extremely slippery and she almost fell several times. She cautioned us to be careful. Shortly afterwards, my other employee was served a martini with a long stran of black hair. The drink was replaced, but no apologies or discounts were offered. In fact, Alyssa chuckled at the idea. I had then excused myself to visit the restroom and upon taking one step from my seat slipped on the floor and came crashing down, almost impaling my arm on a nearby chair. My entire body weight was hanging from the back of this chair! My staff rushed to my aid while the waitstaff stood in awe behind the bar. Mortified, I scurried along pretending to be fine while the pain in my arm progressly intensified. Alyssa was waiting at the table upon my return, but NOT to offer her apologies.  Only to inform me \"that's why she's glad they get to wear Chucks because the floors are always so  slick\" (mind you I was not in heels, nor intoxicated) and to communicate that she was only able to run 80% of my bill on the gift card I had presented for payment (I was awaiting a new debit card in the mail and only had a gc to pay). \"It's something about restaurants and gifts cards. I dont know\" was her response.  My employee was also given the same information. However, in fact 85% of my bill was charged to the gift card so this blew their theory out of the water and I'm left to think that the entire thing was a scam. We soon exited the restaurant, highly disappointed with the turn of events,  to fetch our valet and head home. A manager was never involved and I am in so much pain today that I'm considering visiting my doctor to examine my arm. I guess I just would have expected a bit more from an establishment that presents themselves to be upscale. Instead, I left $47 in the hole for a drink, a fried dough and a prawn that was so fishy I couldn't eat it, still hungry and writhing in pain. It's too bad that the focus got shifted away from the farewell party and on to the poor service."}
{"text":"Loved it!! We came in on the Grand Opening and we had such a nice time! The cocktails were great and we definitely had our share!! The decor is absolutely gorgeous and totally different from any other restaurant in Charlotte - a lot of money and attention was put into this place! All the different light fixtures were really eye catching and of course the ceiling with the whole book of The Art Of War on it- was really a nice touch!!   Onto the most important part for me- the food! We first started with the below and had coursed it out so it wasn't all at once:  Grilled Flat Bread w shrimp- Perfect, light and had great flavors! Bibb Lettuce- Nice and light  Mushroom Gnocchi- My Favorite of the night!! Cooked perfectly!! Crispy Szechuan Pork Belly- Crispy and delicious had a nice little crispy cabbage salad that it was served over St. Louis Style Toasted Mushrooms- were good!!  Indian Spiced Potato Pierogies- they had English Peas and Emulsion with them and they were really Tasty!!   For my Entree I had the Tokyo Noodle Soup- which had Crispy Pork, a Poached Egg and Veggies in a nice Smoky Broth- Delicious!! I honestly don't remember what the other two had, I was more focused on my food!!   Our Server was really nice and explained everything to us! The only bad thing I could say is that the music was a little too loud for dinner service they should hold off on putting it that loud until like 9 or later - I know i sound like an old lady but we found it difficult to hear the server or even runners when they dropped the food off- ok that's all I can think of this time I will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very eclectic. I ordered the 3 egg omelet and was not a good value buy. Adding ingredients with the three is way too expensive. Overall the place is okay but I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"Arrived at the restaurant at 7pm for a 9pm reservation knowing me might not get seated before 9, but was worth a shot. Didn't mind sitting in the bar until 9 if we had to. BUT WAIT, at 9:15, no table, 9:30, no table, then at 9:45 we were seated at a small table in the bar and not in the restaurant! We could have sat there HOURS ago if we wanted. THEN when we confronted the owner Patrick Whalen, he told us to leave! He even ran to the back to hide while sending a bouncer out to remove us. Did I mention we are all women celebrating a 40th birthday and never stepped out of line? So we can't review the food, but the service, WAS HORRIBLE - along with the owner."}
{"text":"5Church is a really cool spot with good food and great ambiance.  I had the \"Local Mixed Greens\" and the \"60 Seconds NY Strip Steak.\" The local mixed greens was a very nice starter salad with great fresh goat cheese. The 60 Second NY Strip Steak is probably the most uniquely prepared steak I have ever had. The steak is grilled to very very crispy on one side, is pink through the middle, and on the other side is left essentially not grilled (rather raw). This leads to a very unique flavor which pairs nicely with the BBQ sauce and grilled vegetables. I've honestly never had anything like it and was pleasantly surprised.  Overall, this is a very cool place with a hip vibe that would be perfect for a date or night out with friends. Would highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"For appetizers Bread, meats and cheese 4 Meat balls 5 Octopus 5 I've never had octopus before. It tasted great but warning the texture is very chewy if you've never had it before Flat bread 3 standard flatbread with cheese   The meal was the lamb 5 As far as lamb goes it was great. I didn't love the horderves.   Lighting 2 it was dark Noise 5. Conversations were easily heard Service 4"}
{"text":"Friendly bar staff and great craft cocktails. Stopped in for a cocktail to wrap a business meeting. I'm a fan of the Old Fashioned but 5Church's New-Fashioned was a interesting and pleasant change."}
{"text":"We had a delightful meal last night. The wait staff was knowledgeable about the menu. The steaks were cooked as ordered and very tasty. The lamb shank was juicy and delicious. The scallops were crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. Interesting decor, relaxed and enjoyable. They even made our special occasion worth celebrating w a big surprise!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch. Ordered the salmon, which was could have been mistaken for pickled herring and the portion of fish was incredibly small. Then the waitress fought with me about how many $2.50 sangrias I drank. I won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"5Church was a beautiful venue but the service and food were extremely mediocre. The prices were way too high for the amount of food received. For example, the wedge salad had literally 7 pieces of lettuce on the plate and it took the waitress nearly 20 min for an additional side of salad dressing. If you are looking for a nice meal, I would highly recommend researching different locations."}
{"text":"Okay this place was recommended to me by a colleague. I was told it was a fun Uptown restaurant with great food and drinks. It was a Wednesday night in Charlotte a few weeks ago and I got there around 7:30. It was pretty busy and I opted to sit at the bar and have dinner. I was in town on business and was there solo. There were a number of other solo diners at the bar that night.   I had the best server, Serena. She was very attentive to everyone at the bar that night. I could not decide between two wines and she offered samples of each. Then I had a delicious beet salad. For my main entree, I ordered a bolognese pasta. Though it looked yummy, the pasta was too al dente...basically crunchy. Serena asked me how I was enjoying my meal. I did not want to be difficult but I was hungry and I could not eat more than a few bites of the pasta. So I asked if if I could which it out for something else. She said yes. Next I got it exchanged for grilled octopus. Serena was so gracious and did not charge me for the pasta. Btw the octopus was so tasty and grateful it came out fairly quickly.   Definitely a big fan of the food, wine, and atmosphere but an even bigger fan of the service. Look forward to getting back there on my next visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Trendy, chic, but yet still having a chill approachable vibe.  Right in the middle of downtown and having a great variety of eats from $3-30 something.  I'm a fan.  The food is great and its a great place for groups.  I've never been somewhere where I can eat what I want and not feel guilty inviting my broke ass friends that need to eat on the cheap.  The whole right side of the menu is under $10 apps and $3-4 bites.  There is even a $13 lamb burger entree.  All the while you can get the \"60 second\" N.Y. Strip that apparently is one of the best steaks Bryant Gumble has had in a long time.  You will see the huge windows when walking up.  I'm not sure what you'll notice first when you walk in, but I love the ceiling.  Local artist Jon Norris(buddy of mine) painted Sun Tzu's art of war among a couple of other works up there.  Next, my eyes take me to the bar.  A long white marble looking bar that goes down the left side of the place and gives depth to the entrance.  The booze is fair priced for downtown and have no complaints with wine list, tap list, or cocktails.  Some good malbec's, Triple C's baby maker, and a \"new-fashioned\" being my fav's.  Anyhow, back to this place.  As I walked to my seat I went up a couple of stairs off to the right.  There are booths, regular seats and combo's of both.  More artwork as well.  Then here comes my waiter.  Spiffy white shirt and Chuck Taylor's.  NICE.  Yet again, trendy/chic but chill and maybe should I even say \"laid back\".  I mean that in a good way, our service was spot on.  As we were in a group and it was a friends birthday, I just ordered the whole right side of the menu.  I wanted an entree but my counterparts don't get out a whole lot, so I wanted them to try it all.  I knew I could snag a few bites off there plates anyhow.  Here we are, the food.  So close to being spot on, but not quite.  Everything was good, the mussels were really good.  Cheese and meat plates both great.  The regular salads, chic pea salads, and quinoa/tabouleh were some of the best bites per $ in town.  I even enjoyed the pierogies and gnocchi.  But it ends there.  The Szechuan pork belly did nothing for me.  While my counterparts loved there brined chicken so much that I didn't get a bite, I was underwhelmed by the lamb burger as well.  It seemed like the lamb wasn't that flavorful while the onion marmalade had too much worcester or A-1 even?  It wasn't bad, but what should I expect from an entree that is a third the price of many others.  It did have some potato logs, aka confit fries that had a mystery sauce.  Some kind of cumin, curry, something.  Need to take some of that home and figure out what it is.  Bottom line.  I need to go back, and do it often.  I know they can wow me.  I can feel it.  I just need to try it all and I'm sure I'll update with a 5 star review."}
{"text":"We had Brunch at 5Church and was impressed with everything from walking in to leaving. The building has a nice upscale look but still a comfortable place to relax and enjoy food.The all metal tree at the door is very impressive art work. Also the art on the walls was very different in a good way. I had the Shrimp & Polenta with a Bacon and Tomatoe Gravy. The tomatoe was a bit different for this type of dish and rounded out the smokiness of the bacon perfectly. Drinks were good as was the serive. The mgr made his way around to most tables and talked to most of the customers, which is always a nice touch. Would definately recommend and visit again"}
{"text":"AMBIENCE Dimly lit, great for parties less than 8. Harder to accommodate many more given seating arrangements. The whole restaurant smells like a wet rag... I've been here for lunch a total of 5 times in the past few months and EVERY single time, it smells like a wet rag. Something should really be done about that. Service is great, the waitresses are super friendly. The kitchen is really off-and-on. Sometimes, the food is great. Sometimes, it's pretty terrible. I don't really understand why since I only come here for lunch and there are almost never more than ~25 people in the restaurant at one time.   LOCATION Off of Tryon kind of by Dandy, across the street from Basil Thai. Parking... I know nothing about. Sorry!   FOOD The food here is pretty good. There are things I like and things I hate. I've never chosen to come here... always seem to come here when Basil Thai is super packed and can't accommodate our party. Their lunch menu is strangely limited and the appetizers are listed on the wrong side of the page.   Fries - kind of oily but good. Sometimes, the fries are delicious. Sometimes, they come out stone cold.   Black bean hummus with pita - Get this. The black bean hummus is ultra-smooth and a strange purple-ish color but super delicious. The oil and tomatoes they add on top really add to the dish. The pita, again... sometimes cold and almost always stale when I've had them.   Jamaican chicken wraps - 2 mini wraps for just under $10?... this is a rip off and not worth it. Don't order it.    Chicken wrap - It's pretty good but again, nothing crazy. All sandwiches come with a side of fries.. (the menu sucks and doesn't mention this)   Ham and cheese - this sandwich is enough for 2 to share. It is HUGE. the bread is really thick and the amount of ham in there really makes it more than just some sandwich you make at home. It's buttered and grilled/toasted. Someone on our table ordered it and the bread was borderline burnt."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, which was lively and upbeat... Loved the service, our waitress was fabulous and able to advise us on food allergies and what was the best on the menu... Steaks were cooked perfectly... We were able to have a business conversation while enjoying the great food... All-in-all, delicious! I recommend the lettuce wraps for an appetizer (note: there are only 2) and steak/potatoes for dinner."}
{"text":"Dining alone while traveling for business can sometimes be less than fun. These folks made it an outstanding experience. Great atmosphere, and the friendly hostess and bar staff had awesome suggestions from the chef-driven menu that changes weekly.  I have some peculiar dietary restrictions and they made it very easy to have a phenomenal dining experience. And have Bret at the bar make you a Moscow Mule with your choice of bourbon rather than vodka.  Outstanding!  Will come here again and again when in Charlotte.  I eat out almost every night and this was, by far, the best dining experience I've had in a while in any city."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on our last day in Charlotte and were happy with our selection.  The Great:   +  $10 lunch special - any sandwich (other than the lamb burger), fries and a drink.  I got the chicken souvlakia sandwich.  Delish.  The fries were crispy and fresh and the bottomless iced tea was a nice touch. +  Our server.  I don't remember her name, but she was short and blond and completely awesome.  Friendly, funny and helpful.  Boom.  The Average: o  It was a bit dark inside and with the place being so large it felt really empty.  Overall, a solid 4-star lunch experience."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for a nice elegant evening out.  Nice ambiance and decor, professional staff that knows the menu and specialties extremely well,  and delivers good service to boot.    The dishes offered have been consistently well reviewed by my guests,  from crab cakes to chicken to desert everyone has loved what they've ordered across the whole menu.  To complement the food they have an excellent bar with unique cocktails (my favorite is the viper a tequila cucumber-water and cayenne masterpiece).  I suppose I could ding them on price,  they aren't cheap,  but the overall experience makes it worth it for me.  Don't go in expecting an inexpensive meal.  Overall, I'll be back, and I will keep leverage five church in particular for our of town guests that have never visited Charlotte before to help drive a positive impression of our city - they help a great deal in that effort."}
{"text":"I met my girlfriends here for brunch Saturday afternoon.   I loved the interior. Especially the storybooks written on the celing! Very nice touch! However, I was a little underwhelmed by the brunch selection.  I started with the Bottomless Sangrias. Best part of the whole meal. I really loved that they included all kinds of fresh berries. Delish! I'd definitely recommend them.   For my meal I went with the Three Egg Omelet. For my three toppings I went with goat cheese, spinach and shrimp. Meh...it was just okay. It definitely wasn't as fluffy and as filled with toppings as I'd hoped for but it was edible.  I also substituted the home fries for french fries. That was not a good idea. They were not the best fries I've ever tasted. A bit crunchy and burnt not a good combination. I wouldn't order it again.   So two stars for the food, an extra star for the sangria. If I come back I'd like to try their dinner menu. But for me there are plenty of other places with better brunch options."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times for drinks and the staff just did not seem interested in serving us. We have not eaten here so can not really comment on the food."}
{"text":"Unique spot! Breakfast was great! The entire \"Art of War\" is painted on the ceiling. The French toast hit the spot and the coffee was served perfectly!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for Thanksgiving and the food was biblically tasty. The atmosphere, the service, the food quality and interior design is just NY in the Queen City. So wonderful! Go! Ignore people who don't give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Not super impressed with 5 Church - it doesn't hold much of a candle to some of the better, more unique and local restaurants in Charlotte.  I've been to 5 church on three different occasions and each time I've left saying \"it was ok.\" Most recently, I had the jerk chicken lettuce wraps for an appetizer, which had a poorly matched ratio of chicken to lettuce - needed more meat! For dinner, I had their lamb burger, which sounded great with the gorgonzola cheese and arugula. The crispy confit potato just didn't work for me, and though I asked for medium, the burger came out medium well. The sesame bun looked pretty but didn't taste fresh. The service wasn't great and though we didn't wait long for a table, the service for food and even drinks was relatively slow.   I think the space in 5church has so much potential. It's a great spot for lunch meetings and the bar and inside is beautiful! I have been here for group events as well (large birthday parties), and I do have to say they did handle the large group well. I think their main attraction is the inside space area. I just think they have a little ways to go on their food."}
{"text":"Heard this is a hotspot in downtown Charlotte so checked it out on a recent visit. Was not at all disappointed.  Very friendly and organized front of the house despite a very loud and slightly chaotic open concept bar and dining area. We were a bit early so started at the bar. I had the \"new\" fashioned, which was good but not any better than a well made \"old\" fashioned.  We ordered the tasting menu with wine pairings which was delightful, and added a couple of extra courses so we could have some items not on the tasting menu. Only slip up was that I asked for the Tokaji instead of the moscato for the dessert course, and they gave me the moscato anyway.  Lot of good options in Charlotte, but I will be happy to visit 5Church again."}
{"text":"Just left brunch at 5 church. We loved the cozy atmosphere, delicious food, and great service. We left our card at the table and Kevin sprinted down the street to return it. Class act establishment. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"ONLY reason I didn't leave a 5 star is the noise. This place is so loud. Granted I did come on a Friday night. Shout out to our server Michelle. Awesome service for being busy. New fashion cocktail had crushed walnut on the rim tasted like cherry pie. The viper was a nice alternative from the really sweet cocktails. We had the Waygu ribeye, lamb burger, pork belly spring rolls and gnocchi. Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection. I'd highly recommend the Gnocchi."}
{"text":"Food was good, however the ambiance made it a bit unpleasant.  We were seated right by the door (on one of those 15 degree January nights) and had to wear our coats the entire meal.  Service was very slow, and we were shivering by the end!  We had a reservation and watched as they set a table up for us right by the door...I wouldn't really recommend this restaurant, it wasn't worth having to be so cold for an entire meal.  I've definitely had better food and service else where in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Another one of those places a lot of 20 something's go to because they think it's cool.  Food is very average, service was great and the ambiance was pretty cool.  Not upset about this place just had my hopes a lot higher.   Here is why.....  Lamb burger was recommended by the staff so I got it and it was GREAT.  Szechuan pork belly was unflavored fried pork belly strips with a decent shredded lettuce type bite on the side.  It was not bad but nothing I'd order again.  Tomato soup was almost flavorless and had ONE small piece of fried cheese or something (I forget).  It was also warm, not hot and when I order soup it should come HOT.  Pierogis tasted decent but weren't bursting with flavor at all.  Gnocci was actually pretty crappy and didn't have a good solid texture at all.   I would never go back here unless someone else was offering to pay."}
{"text":"Eggs benny. Fries. Coffee.  Color me happy. My brunch at 5Church was a solid meal with friends. I loved my crab cakes benedict, which had some sort of magical jalapeno hollandaise sauce for dipping. The fries were tasty, but the order was a little small, and most of the fries seemed to be broken little nubbins instead of the nice long fries everyone really wants.   Negatives: One of my friends said her omelette had an \"obscene\" amount of butter, and another friend ordered the special meat pie only to find that her entire meal was about the size of a sand dollar. Service was also disappointing -- we had to wait forever for our bill, for ketchup, and for attention in general. But my meal was so good that I'll give it a pass this time. Maybe they were just swamped that day?  The bottom line for brunch at 5Church is this: Expect good food, but don't expect a huge meal unless you order a few items, and be prepared for a long meal because service ain't speedy."}
{"text":"5Church has good food, but a very limited menu, and but the service is horrible. I have been there several times and it's always the same. Three of many examples:   1. Workday lunch: hostess aloof, got a table, sat down for 10 minutes, no one came over even to get us drinks. Got up and left and no one noticed. They weren't busy it was before the rush  2. Another workday lunch: Came again before the rush at 11:30. In fact I was the FIRST customer. I sat down and no one came to say hello or get my drink order for nearly 10 minutes until I got tired of waiting and went to the bar and complained. At the same time, a large group came in AFTER me, and the server got their drink orders and drinks and took their order for their meal.  3. Drinks and small plates: I went there for drinks and small plates with a group of friends one evening. The food and drinks were good, but took forever and half the time we had to get up and get drinks from the bar instead of our server."}
{"text":"Had a girls night out at this restaurant. The food was excellent and artfully prepared and presented.  Service was slow.   We were supposed to go to a show but hadn't even received our food so we cancelled the show and decided to linger and make 5 church the evening, which turned out great anyway because our company was great and ambiance at 5 church is awesome sexiness.  I had ordered a bottle of prosecco for the table to make a toast, but never was asked if I'd like a glass of something with dinner.  At some point our server acknowledged his lack of attention and made a good effort to redeem himself after entrees.   Last point... Dessert here is a culinary achievement!  Don't pass up on it!  Skip your 300 calorie latte after lunch and save room for dessert!  It is worth it !.. I had the espresso mousse with chocolate sorbet.  Ah. Mazing!"}
{"text":"Great Service, Great food. I came here when my parents came to visit. We wanted a nicer dinner and were not disappointed. I did their one of a kind 60 second steak. They sear it in a really hot pan for 60 seconds. I typically like my steak med-rare, I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about having one side of my steak completely uncooked. The texture wasn't not bad like I expected. It tasted like a med rare steak and is cool to look at.   The best thing I had however was the s'mores dessert. It tasted like a fresh s'more. The down side was it wasn't warm like the real thing. I would go back just for the dessert."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night during restaurant week and tried the: 1 - pork belly appetizer - delicious but tiny  2 - tofu and edamame succotash entree - pretty good but the tofu was a little bland and the sauce a bit heavy for the yummy fresh veggies  3 - banana walnut dessert - yummm, nice sea salt touch  4 - side of potatoes - not good.   My dinner mate LOVED her NY strip.   The bread has some sort of cheese in it - ok, but a little strange.   The noise volume is OUT OF CONTROL! But matches the very cool and trendy ambiance - nicely decorated.    The service is decent - attentive but a little slow.   I would recommend as a place to see and be seen uptown but not necessarily the best food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Went here last Sunday fro brunch with my family. There was no wait, and the service was good. I usually got at night for dinner but the brunch was nice. The bottomless mimosa and sangria are a nice topping to the unique brunch menu."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this restaurant. It has a great upscale casual ambience. Although there is lots of conversation, it is not noisy so you can't have your own conversation The food was excellent, very tasty, and the presentation was perfect. I had ahi tuna, and my wife had steak. The waitstaff is very helpful and attentive. This experience is well worth the visit."}
{"text":"I came to 5church with a party of 11 today for Brunch.  My family was celebrating Father's day for three fathers and my Mother's Birthday.  I have been to 5 church in the past and have enjoyed the food and the service, which is why I was excited to share the experience with my family and friends.  Unfortunately the experience was not pleasant.  After waiting 30 minutes to have our order taken, it took more than an hour for our food to be served.  When it arrived many of the items were lukewarm and most included items that were not ordered (ex. three people ordered homefries but got french fries instead)  In addition, when I mentioned this to the manager she indicated that she would check on it but never came to the table to offer an apology or ask about our experience.  It was a really disappointing brunch experience."}
{"text":"5Church is my kind of church, I could see myself being in the congregation every Sunday.  Shrimp & grits, breakfast pizza and crabcakes with poached eggs. Yes, can I get an Amen?  Pastor Chef Jamie is kicking ass.  Of course, Sunday isn't complete without bloody marys or mimosas, bases covered."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a conference. I read reviews that said a lot of people struggled with finding the restaurant because of location & it's true. If it wasn't for me being hyper vigilant I probably would have missed it. We got there before 6 & valet wasn't working yet so we parked in a parking deck a 5 minute walk away & it was only $6. The restaurant is beautiful and a really fun place to go out with friends. I started with the 'Bibb Wedge' salad, which was good there was a sweet dressing on the salad I wasn't too crazy about. For my main meal I had the Filet Mignon with crushed potatoes and the chef specialty sauce. I got my meat cooked medium well & it came out just that way. The food was really good I just wasn't feeling the sauce because maybe I was expecting A1 but the sweetness threw me off. I like to separate the savory and the sweet (obviously). For desert I had the S'mores Trifle which was delicious! The presentation of the desert was beautiful & it was the perfect amount. The brownie (?) part of the bar was really good & chocolate-y. I couldn't finish everything so I had to take it home. I hope to visit this place again soon."}
{"text":"Went for a company dinner and ordered the New York strip. In their defense, they did describe how it was cooked (only on one side) and told me people loved it that way. That it was a technique they used there. Ordered it medium rare. It came out raw on the top. And burnt on the bottom. The top, uncooked part was cold and raw. Absolutely disgusting. And for $39? No thanks.   Also, none of their wines have vintages on the menu. If you're at all a wine drinker, this would drive you crazy.  Cool looking space, but food and drink falls short big time. Everyone in my group agreed that we wouldn't recommend his place to any of our friends."}
{"text":"The food was a-ok, but the service was not. For the price-point (dinner entrees ranging from $16 - $34) I expected much better service and really outstanding food.  For me, this is an ok place to stop in for a couple of drinks & appetizers with friends if you are in no hurry, but for serious dining, it is not my first choice."}
{"text":"Really love this place! The vibe and decor is great for a special occasion or just for date night. The drinks are good, but a little pricey. The food can be beat. I've never had anything I didn't like here, but the crab cakes and the lamb burger are personal favorites. It's not the kind of place that you would order a takeout plate from, as much of the appeal is from the ambiance, but definitely a spot to try in Charlotte. And, if you're into the club scene, it gets much more \"see and be seen\" on Saturday nights after 10pm. Plus complimentary valet!"}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte on business. Asked hotel front desk clerk where can I find good seafood and a good beer. He pointed me to this spot. Not bad. It was nearly empty on a Sunday evening which I thought was unusual, but not familiar with Charlotte so maybe people stay home and cook Sunday's. ? Anyway, they had upbeat music playing. I sat at the bar. The bartender was really nice, knowledgeable, and helpful. I had a local draft beer, the beet salad and the yellowfin tuna. Good eats. Not superb, but good...and reasonably priced. Curious to know what the experience would be like on a busy night."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and it was delightful. The entire atmosphere is beautiful and clean. Our waiter was so knowledgeable on every aspect that we really didn't even need menus. While it is pricey, for the true uptown dining experience, it is worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend lives a block away so we used to come here a lot when he first moved to Charlotte. Over time, we asked ourselves what the heck we were doing. We now walk right on by and go almost anywhere else for a meal. The first time we went to 5Church the host was bragging to us about how many famous people and athletes dine here. We couldn't care less but it was hilarious nevertheless.   5Church's main problem is that they think they're something they're not. Pretentious is an understatement. The think they are Cut in Las Vegas when in reality they are a trendy version of Outback. If they can get a reality check and lower their prices and make their food taste better, it would be better for everyone. Another problem is it's too loud and crowded. It's more of a bar than a restaurant. But the food isn't any better at off peak times.   Onto the food: overpriced, overhyped, not good. The only good dish on the menu for dinner is a steak if it's cooked well. The only reasonable choice on their menu for lunch is the lamb burger. I've tried about half of the dishes.   Last time we came here was for brunch (party of 4) and none of our meals were even edible. I'm not overreacting. The charcuterie plate was ok actually but that's where it ended (and it's hard to mess up sliced cheese!). It's a shame because the descriptions sounded so good on the menu but just didn't translate in reality.   5Church is probably a good place to pick up drunk girls on the weekend, but that's about it. If you're coming for dinner, keep walking half a block and Capital Grille is on the left. You'll get a much better meal for the same price."}
{"text":"With all the hype surrounding 5Church, I expected more, but sadly, I was let down. And I should preface this review by saying I am not a fan of grossly upscale restaurants with high prices. So if you're like me, then read on...if you're not, you may want to save a few minutes & read another review. ;)  Dion L., Katie M., Simone M. & myself dined here on a busy Wednesday night. Dion had made us 7 PM reservations, which I was glad to say they kept that time.  First impressions: the place is pretty well laid out, with two bars - one in the front of the restaurant & I believe I saw another one in the back area. VERY loud - wouldn't advise bringing a first date here.  Also, the darker it got outside, the darker it got inside. Additionally, you had the blinding lights from traffic outside, since the majority of the restaurant is surrounded by windows.  This was a bit annoying, especially when two cop cars rolled by.  Not sure what the theme they're going for in there, but there's lots of gray/silver & fancy lighting fixtures. Waiters & waitresses are dressed down, mainly in grays & blacks. It was clean inside & they're pretty quick to clear off used plates.  The menu itself is somewhat limited. I would argue to say they have more wine, beer, & liquor choices than they do food items.  Due to being on a budget, we all decided we weren't going to ball out on our meals.  While our waitress gave us all recommendations & laid out how big \"first courses\" & \"snacks\" were, she was way off base with what I decided upon.  I asked about the fresh angel hair pasta (first course at $10), to which she said it could feed two people. I was really hungry, so I ordered that, along with the crisp Szechuan pork belly with spicy cabbage (snack at $4). For the snack, the waitress said it would feed one.  Dion & Katie ordered a first course & snacks.  Simone ordered the lamb burger.  We waited quite a bit for our food, which was a bit annoying since Dion was on her dinner break from work. Finally our food arrived & I was a bit disappointed.  The pasta was in a small bowl, with an even smaller portion of pasta, five cherry tomatoes, & 2 medium sized shrimp. That was not enough for two people.  The pasta tasted OK...the angel hair was heavy on the wheat taste.  The pork belly & cabbage was pretty good. The pork belly was crispy & cooked thoroughly. It indeed was only enough for one person. The girls were ok with their choices, although Simone did comment that her lamb burger seemed to be bigger when she had it there for brunch one day.   While we ate, our waitress was kind of scarce, but as we were finishing up our meal, she came by quite frequently. Luckily, Dion had time to finish her meal and pay her bill.   At the end of our meal, we decided this spot is better suited for drinks & a snack...not full on dining."}
{"text":"Finally made it in for dinner! We've been jonesin' to try this place after hearing about it from friends and other Yelpers. It was slammin' on a Wednesday night around 8pm and the food, drink and conversation was flyin' all around. Every seat at the bar was filled, all of the high-tops, the lounge areas and pretty much every table. Definitely one of the premier places to check out.   The art throughout the restaurant totally makes you think twice, buffalos and cherry blossoms, really strange lamps, incredible ornate wing-shaped lampshades over the bar and sweet mural of a $5 bill in the upstairs. The best, by far, is the steel tree near the hostess stand. It really stands out and blends well with the rest of the decor. It doesn't stop there. Check out the ceiling tiles. The ENTIRE book of the The Art of War is painted on them. Yep. I said it. You'll have to see if for yourself. So crazy.   We started with the pirogies and goat cheese with spinach. Both were fantastically flavorful and perfect for a table of two. Pirogies were almost like Indian samosas with the spices inside. The dough was flaky and had a slight chew. The pea mixture on bottom was to die for. Definitely both worth getting again!  Wow. 5Church still has me astounded and still trying to find the right words for the \"60-Second\" Steak. I can barely describe the difference in texture from rare steak to crunchy, crispy and perfectly seared bottom. Each bite was a perfect savory balance hit with the tangy, malty, barbecue-y steak sauce resting at the bottom of the plate. I don't order steak, pretty much ever, but this has stolen my steak-loving heart. Goodness gracious, it was incredible. A fantastic NY Strip. I'm still having daydreams about it.   The staff hoofs it. Up the stairs and then back down. Huge trays, drinks, server books...they never stop moving. All with a smile and very knowledgeable.   Can't wait to visit again! Chef Jamie and the team really have something going here. Totally chic and swanky but with a casual appeal. Bravo, gents. My hat's off to you for a fantastic evening of flavor and fun."}
{"text":"So 800 plus of my colleagues are visiting the QC for our annual Chef's conference.  An old friend and chef asks us to join her at 5 Church on a Tuesday night at 7.  I'm looking forward to catching up and trying this place for a second time, since the first was for lunch and was just okay. We were escorted to our table on time.  The waiter did some research on our friend and creepily told her where she was from, who she worked for and what she did for a living.  He up-played that she was also a chef and that he had high expectations of himself to serve her. (Is it getting smoky in here?). He then told us his work biography, like why should we be hearing this? So I asked what the specials were for the night. He left to get beverages. I really like the chairs at the tables. They do not look comfortable but they are nice. Our waiter told us about portion sizes and servings for apps, and was very knowledgable. We enjoyed the pieroghis, though the dough was a bit thick; the hummus was just that; and the pork belly sliders were tender but too much bread.  Would have been better a top of a crouton and called an open faced slider.  We placed our order for entrees. My wife and our friend ordered a salad with country ham; I order duck in mole sauce.  A little slow in service but the salads are served in less than 10 minutes.  They are kindly waiting for my entree to start eating but no entree!  After 5 more minutes our server apologizes to us stating he did not fire my entree but will be right out.  A total of 20 minutes pass and they serve me.  Strangely it looks nothing like duck or any sign of mole sauce.  Of course no one to be found to ask so I tell the others to please start eating and, embarrassed, go find my server who is talking to the manager.  I tell them that they served me the wrong item and that I did not want to cause a scene in front of our friend/host, and to please just remove the entree w/o any questions.  They pleaded with me that they will have the duck served immediately with apologies.  I cave in.   Upon returning to the table my wife and friend stopped eating; my duck was served.  They said the salad tasted like some one had shaken a salt shaker over it(and both of them love country ham).  My entree was luke warm.  Manager told us that they would comp my entree.  When the bill was presented to our host, it was not taken off the bill. No desserts ordered. Spoke to the manager when leaving and gave him my business card.  Never heard a thing from him.  Would have been a nice touch inviting back for something to be hospitable. Went home for snacks. Lucky they got 3 stars. You take your chances if you go there."}
{"text":"This review is for their kiosk at the Charlotte Christmas Village in Romare Bearden Park.  Firstly, the Christmas Village itself is downright depressing and disappointing, not that many people. Having said that, there weren't that many people on line at the 5Church vendor.   So, 5Church should be glad that they actually had a small line queuing up for their bratwurst. But when it was my turn to order, the young lady taking my orders had an attitude, seemed displease, and felt as if I was intruding in her time. She just shoved the bratwurst and sauerkraut I ordered to me. And when I asked for mustard, basically just threw it at me with no eye contact and thank you. (Nice Christmas Spirit and Southern hospitality.) This after talking to what seemed like forever to the other people in front of me, even offering them mustard after their order and giving them a lot of mustard in mini-cups. But me? Just one. And I practically had to beg for it. And I gave a 20% tip on my card. If I would've gotten the food and service first before paying, I should've left No Tip. But I always tip..  Regardless, I don't know the five churches to where they derive their name from, but based on my experience at their Christmas Village kiosk, seems like the five churches in 5Chrurch are where The Grinch, Scrooge, the Anti-Christ, Beelzebub, and Lucifer reign.They should name their business the 666Church.   You're a mean one Miss 5Church. You're a nasty wasty skunk. Your heart is full of unwashed socks. Your soul is full of gunk,Miss 5Church.You're a three-decker sauerkraut, and toadstool wurst, with arsenic sauce!   Pathetic!  *****UPDATE***** So, I got a \"compliment\" from Joanne S (of University City, Charlotte, NC https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Ki1UVO0eP9qmoyugKPqNKQ), on Christmas Eve I must add, saying: \"Get over yourself. Your complaining about an 8 dollar sandwich. Oh wait a 9.60 sandwich after your 20% tip\"  Firstly, I didn't just purchase a sandwich.  Secondly, regardless, how much does one have to spend at your blessed business for one to be treated with respect as a customer and without the contempt and attitude from you or any of the 5Church staff?  Lastly, thank you for confirming of your disdainful attitude and 5Church's supercilious standpoint on running its business.  And a Merry Christmas to you too. At least the Grinch and Scrooge had a change of heart after realizing their immodest ways."}
{"text":"Reviews for 5Church seem to be all over the map, and so I was a bit hesitant to make a reservation for a Labor Day weekend dinner with the family.  Well, let me tell you something, 5Church is incredible!  Between their unique contemporary vibe, impeccable service, and perfectly executed dishes, I declared the evening epic success.    When I made our reservation on Open Table, I specifically requested a table in a quieter area of the restaurant, as I heard that it can become very loud.  The noise wasn't any problem at all when we arrived at 7pm, but some louder music with a heavy bass made the restaurant notably loud around 8:30pm.  Still though, we were able to have conversations without feeling as though we were yelling.  For appetizers we shared the cheese plate and mixed greens salad.  Our waiter offered to split the salad three ways and we were impressed by the portion size of each plate.  The marinated mushrooms, dressing, and cheese are a great combination.  The cheese plate came with three generous sized wedges of cheddar, blue, and feta cheeses, along with tons of olives, a beet pesto, olive tapenade, and candied raisins.  My only complains would be that the \"fresh\" bread basket they serve was not at all impressive, tasting either stale or just simply not good.  Our entree selections included NC Grouper, Wasabi Crusted Salmon, and Lamb Burger.  The grouper was served over a bed of succotash, popcorn shoots, and a red pepper emulsion.  It was very fresh, light, and generously portioned.  The salmon dish was nothing short of perfection.  The combination of the wasabi crust, rich miso emulsion, seaweed salad, and bok choy left us savoring each and every bite.  Finally, the lamb burger with it's grilled onion marmalade earned lots of oohs and ahhs.  At just $13, it's certainly a steal of a deal.    Since the entire meal had been incredible, we couldn't help but order dessert.  We shared the S'mores selection swooned with each bite.  Think warm decadent chocolate cake, crystalized fudge sauce, and homemade marshmallow.  Again - a huge portion that is easy to share between several at the table."}
{"text":"I struggle between giving 5Church 2 or 4 stars.  5Church has the potential to be a great restaurant; it has a great vibe, found in a charming location, and entrees riddled with flavor.  But some days the kitchen struggles and outright fails to provide a quality and consistent experience.  Furthermore, a good night might be derailed by a waitstaff that seems to disappear hours on end.   Will I go back? Probably.  Should you go? Probably.   ...but you've been warned. You may receive a 4 star night or a 2 star one, it just depends on the whims of the kitchen and the waitstaff."}
{"text":"Finally made it to 5Church after hearing a lot about the food and ambiance.  Add me to the list of people that are a fan of this place.  Went to lunch with a coworker.  First impressions are very good - comfortable, cool decor, a clear artistic vibe with local artists paintings and the text of \"Art of war\" on the ceiling.  Service was excellent from beginning to end.  Had the grilled prosciutto di parma, which delivered on all fronts - fresh mozzarella, tomatoes full of flavor, all surrounded by grilled white bread that was perfectly chewy on the inside.  It went from good to great with the balsamic served on the side.  In addition, had the tomato soup, which was quite killer.  Pure tomato puree, no cream, just tons of fresh flavor.  Had a taste of my coworkers lamb burger - perfectly cooked and tasty.    All in all, a great lunch spot (prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food and experience).  Looking forward to returning for dinner, may have to evaluate my rating and move to 5 starts if that experience delivers as well."}
{"text":"I love it here! 1) The place is sooo beautiful! You can tell there was a lot of love, sweat and care put into the design of the space, just look up. There's no other environment like it in Charlotte. 2) The service staff is great. I was greeted pleasantly by the hostess up front as I walked in the door. My server was friendly and on point all night. Justin was amazing and funny! The bar service was also fast (which means a lot to me, haha) and we didn't wait long for food. I really enjoyed the chickpea salad and black bean hummus. 3) I love that there's a late night menu, so that I don't have to resort to going to a bar or a diner if I want to eat a meal at midnight. I can't wait for them to open for lunch!  Seriously, you need to go into 5Church or you will miss out on something great. I am so excited for Charlotte to have a beautiful and refreshing restaurant as such. As one of the few, an actual Charlotte native, it make me proud to see such a great establishment right in the heart of my city. 5Church is here to stay people, the second you walk in the door you will see."}
{"text":"What a gem of a place. Service was great and the food phenomenal. We had a spinach salad - delicious and fresh. Then we had a 60 second steak. OMG! One of the tastiest most innovative steaks I've had in a long time and Chef's version of A-1 was A+. The lamb burger was outstanding. It comes with hand cut fries that were fantastic. Chef also sent a complimentary hummus and house made crackers - we were appreciative of such a nice gesture. We stayed at the Ivey's and couldn't have been more pleased with the hotel and the food! Charlotte, you are lucky to have such great food and wonderful Hotel."}
{"text":"5Church has three locations, and I have been to two (Atlanta and Charlotte). I've never been disappointed. Their brunch and dinner menus are incredible. I highly recommend their 60 second steak. The interior gives a calming prohibition style vibe and is very welcoming. I find that service is slower at brunch, but nothing too bad. Great dining option for business dinners as well. They are also available for party rentals."}
{"text":"Had an incredible meal tonite at 5Church. Charred octopus & wasabi crusted tuna were delicious. Both dishes could be good but loved the added nuance that made these dishes great. The spice that pushed the octopus to another level & the wasabi crust on the tuna elevated an otherwise plain piece of tuna; yummy with that flavorful seaweed salad. Then there was dessert. I am not a sweet eater but hubby ordered the red velvet cake. The contrast of the salted pistachios w/ the cake was divine. Now to service. A+. From the friendly hostesses to the manager checking on tables. A special treat was our waitress Cathrine. Friendly & to top it off we once both lived on the same street in Chevy Chase, MD!  Loved that the hostess offered to take our ticket out to the complimentary valet while we paid the bill. No waiting.  A perfect evening for our 22nd wedding anniversary. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Went to 5Church with a buddy after a 5K one evening.  As this was my first time there, I was unsure what to expect.  I had heard lots about this new, jumping, spot Uptown, but the descriptions were always a bit vague as to why exactly it was so good... ....well allow me, if I may, to go into some detail about what exactly makes 5Church pop...  ...First, the service;  its top notch.  Our server was extremely pleasant and polite and she was very understanding of the fact that we were with a hodgepodge group of friends and that people were ordering food and drinks at all different times.  Yet and still, she was on-point with the service and she was very accurate with the checks at the end of the night as well - no problems splitting the check.  She was quick to refill drinks or to ask if we needed more adult beverages, which of course we always did.  Second, the food.  The food was excellent.  We split the \"Bacon Pizza\" as an appetizer.  It tasted very fresh, and made to order.  It was thin slice/flat bread, which I am not normally a fan of, but the bacon really made the pie explode in my mouth (That's what she said, LOL).  For my main course, I ordered the Grilled Hanger Steak.  The words savory and exquisite come to mind when I think about the Hanger Steak  It was cooked perfectly, and had a wonderful grilled, smokey flavor to it.    Third, the uniqueness.  Though they had plenty of tables, my buddy and I sat on leather couches with the rest of our friends and had a very enjoyable dinner.  I have never been to an establishment that married the lounge/tapas vibe with that classy, restaurant taste, and service, as well as 5Church.    I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for something different, and a little hipper than you standard, upscale steakhouse."}
{"text":"I went to meet some friends Uptown for drinks and dinner at this really cute place.   We got there earlier than one of our party and spent some time in the bar area. It had lots of seating and good specialty drinks. I really liked The Metropolitan and The Wildberry Mojito (try them if you like tart and sweet drinks)  We were seated at a nice little table and ordered our apps - Appetizers that I liked - the cheese plate and the hummus, both were really good.  We ordered dinner and I had a wedge salad and a Lamb Burger. Now the salads were less than impressive, but I loved the Lamb Burger! Really yummy.  The fries that come with it are huge and really flavorful.  The sauteed green beans are amazing as a side - I would totally order those instead of a salad.  The dessert menu had just been changed for winter - so we decided to try a few of them. I really liked the sorbet and the marshmallow parfait (I can't remember it's exact name) but it had chocolate and creme in a glass. OMG - so good.  We ended with Cappuccinos.. nice and foamy..   Over all, a very good experience. I will update on my next trip.   Oh and they have complimentary valet as well. That is always a plus."}
{"text":"Had lunch here a couple days ago.  Excellent atmosphere, comfortable.  Casual service in an upscale surrounding.  I had the beet slides, great meal, good size for a lunch.  They served pickled vegetables on the side, very good.  Prices appeared reasonable.  Lunch partners had a crab cake sandwich and lamb burger, both looked good."}
{"text":"This was my first time at 5church, but we wanted a nice meal while some co-workers were visiting in town. I have heard great things, but it was still different than expected.   The atmosphere is very upscale, romantic and intimate, so it was a little weird to be with a large group of co-workers while couples had romantic dinners next to us, but that's not the restaurants fault.   The menu is a little sparse and many of the options were the same types of meat. There was only one chicken dish and one vegetable dish. I typically stay away from red meat so I had to settle on one of the two. I went with the chicken. OH MAN. So to be honest, I didn't eat a ton of the chicken because I got so side-tracked by the deliciousness of the rice that accompanied it. I have no idea what it was, but it was different and better than anything I had ever tasted.   I will also say, one coworker ordered a side of Brussel sprouts and another coworker attempted to order another one and the waitress told us that it was enough for the whole table. We had 6 people and it definitely was not. When the first order came out we put in an order for a second. The two orders were prepared entirely different. The first just roasted and seasoned and the second were roasted with a sweet glaze. Don't know what happened there."}
{"text":"First impression: WHOA BOUGIE, HIP, CLASSY, WOW.  The entire space was just so lively and I love how the decor was specially designed for the restaurant itself. I love the seats, it was just so cozy and very different!   We came for brunch, so I ordered the Crab Cakes and Poached Eggs. The presentation is stunning! The crab cakes were much smaller than I had expected them to be. It needed a little bit more salt because there was (I believe spinach) in the dish too (btw I LOVED THAT). I tried a little bit of the waffles from my cousin and she said it tasted like Christmas, and it legit TASTED LIKE CHRISTMAS.   Our waiter was super friendly, kinda awkward but that made it interesting. It was a nice place to enjoy brunch and wasn't too crowded when I went!"}
{"text":"pasta size is very big! Charred octopus is spicy and salty. Broiled oysters are only two oysters."}
{"text":"OK - I'm upping my rating because brunch at 5Church is great. I had the crab cakes with poached eggs. I love crab and I love eggs and these two worked so well together.  The eggs were perfectly poached - the perfect amount of runny-ness.   The mimosa was great.  They have bottomless mimosas for $12 but I didn't partake in that because I probably wouldn't know when to stop - but that's a great deal!  I'm glad to be won over by 5Church by their brunch - the ambiance is great and makes for an enjoyable Sunday."}
{"text":"One of the best bars I have been into! What a gem for Charlotte! I was in town for 3 days and this was hands down the best bar we went to.  The decor and ambiance you can not beat. Love love loved the hand painted ceiling! And the chandeliers and paintings were all very fitting with the decor. They played great music! And it was just music over a speaker and it was better then the live DJ we saw earlier in the night and the live band we saw the night before. We even made our own dance floor.  The drinks were great! I had everything from a martini to a Margherita to a Moscow Mule and they were all delicious and well priced. Nothing was over priced like all the other bars in Charlotte. I unfortunately did not eat here but after looking at the menu I wish I would have. Will definitely return to try out the food.  The service was the best part! Everyone was so attentive. They were so busy but we still never waited longer then 3 minutes to get a drink. We talked to 3 different bartenders and they were all great. Even the back of bar staff was friendly and noticed we were standing and tried to help us with seats without us even asking! Can't beat the location either it was right beside my friends apartment in a great neighborhood downtown."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on opening night so I was prepared for potentially sub par service and slip ups. Not the case! Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about all the menu items as well as the restaurant overall and continually checked on us to make sure all was well.  The food at 5Church also exceeded expectations. The lamb burger was incredibly juicy and flavorful with a hint of maybe Indian or Mediterranean flavors and the gnocchi (a small plate appetizer item) was so rich and creamy - without a doubt the best I've ever had. Menu items in general seem to be well-executed dishes with a twist.   The ambiance is modern and trendy. A great spot for a special occasion. The bottom floor has tables, a bar area and a large shared high top table seating. The upstairs loft area has lounge areas and an additional bar for the late night crowd."}
{"text":"I've come here on multiple occasions and I've had the lamb burger, filet mignon & the pan roasted Tile fish. The lamb burger was cooked well, but way over seasoned. It was way too salty that I couldn't enjoy each bite I took. The filet was cooked to perfection. It was tender and almost melted like butter. Now the tile fish blew me away. I've personally never had tile fish, and this was my first time really ordering fish at a restaurant since I'm not a huge fan of seafood. However it was amazing. It was a little crispy on the outside and the inside was soft and light. I thoroughly enjoy coming here for dinner as well as coming here to grab drinks every weekend before heading to the epicenter"}
{"text":"Yes, I am a sucker for trendy and hip décor! And, \"YES!\"  It was the feathery light fixture photos on yelp pulled me in. lol! Of course the food has to be good too. The reviews were mostly good so here I am :)  As soon as I walked in, I knew we were under dressed. It said \"casual\" under \"more info\" on yelp so I thought jeans and a sweater was okay. Before she even sat us down, I knew we were going to get a not-so-wonderful table.  We were sat in the bar area at the very end within a stone's throw (more like a toss) of the bathrooms. Sigh. We passed a couple empty bar tables that were in the middle of the bar section on the way to our seats. Most people were in business attire since it was 5:30 and they probably just came straight from work. I griped a little about our seating but the bf didn't think it was a big deal so we stayed put. Note to self: when in doubt, dress it up a little if you want to get a nice table.  Restaurant industry people, is that how it goes? But honestly, I hate getting dressed up :/  Jeremiah was our waiter and he was very friendly and attentive. I also liked how other waiters and Mark, who I will assume was the manager, came around and filled our waters and checked on us as well. Whenever I dine out, I also usually notice if/when waiters seem disappointed when customers don't order alcohol (more drinks, bigger bill, larger tip). I didn't notice any change in their attitude when we declined cocktails (we're trying not to drink during the week). The service was solid throughout the whole meal. They were perfect!  I ordered the prime grilled bistro steak with horseradish mashed potatoes and glazed vegetables ($27) and he ordered the wasabi encrusted salmon with bok choy ($19). My dish was good but not spectacular. The bf's dish was exceptional. I wish I had ordered his dish. I have been burnt out on salmon for a couple years now but the wasabi and miso flavors made it superb and I would jump back on the salmon train (or is boat more appropriate? lol) for it. Don't get me wrong. I liked my dish and it was GOOD but it was nothing compared to the salmon. I also think it was a bit heavy for me with the potatoes. I think I would've liked it more if it had more vegetables. We ended the meal with the vanilla crème brulee ($8) with berries for dessert.  I can't end my review without talking about the décor. Definitely my kind of place. I loved all the light fixtures and art. And those feathery light fixtures above the bar ARE beautiful. The photos on yelp don't do it justice. Don't forget to look up at the ceiling. I love the little details. We sat on the wooden high tables in the bar. Next time I want to sit at the black leather button tufted booth or the tables with the clear acrylic chairs. I guess I'll have to wear my Sunday best so I can sit there when I try their brunch one of these weekends...and I'll order cocktails for sure! ;)"}
{"text":"I always have great service here but I've never had a meal that I thought was worth the price. The atmosphere is upscale and it's great for dates. The food is just not that special. Ive tried the French dip, bread salad, waffles, and curry tacos- all fine but nothing id be excited to order again"}
{"text":"Friday night we headed to 5Church with some friends since he previously had said he wanted to check it out. We had made birthday reservations for 7:30pm. 5Church had some things going for it and some things going against.  The first thing against? We didn't get seated until 8. I know, it was restaurant week. The place was bumping. I get it. But as a restaurant goer, I'm not cool waiting thirty minutes for a reservation. Just not cool.  What about the first thing in their favor? I'd made the reservation so long ago, I totally forgot I'd told them we were celebrating a birthday! They gave us a round of drinks on the house just for the occasion. That was a pretty stellar way to start - and it made up for the wait.  I had a seasonal salad to start that wasn't bad - it included squash and beets with Boursin cheese. Then for the main course I had a filet with mashed potatoes and brussels. The main course was decent. I've had better steaks elsewhere, but I love brussel sprouts and not a ton of places embrace them so I was down. I'm not sure I would order the filet if I went back though. I have a feeling their regular menu offered other things that would have been better. What I'm saying is - don't go just for the filet  Go for the desserts. We ordered the s'mores trifle and the chocolate pretzel bar. Droooooool. Superb. Highly recommend. And my blackberry drink was also spectacular so... at least go for drinks and a dessert."}
{"text":"Such a cute, trendy lounge type of bar/restaurant.  I love the decor and there are great cocktail options.  Plates are all small, but great for just a snack or some apps.  DJ and good music on the weekends as the night gets later.  I love going here with some friends for drinks and a good time!"}
{"text":"I have been to 5Church twice. and I enjoyed it both times for lunch.  I would recommend getting the lamb burger and fries.  The lamb burger is cooked to perfection and is bursting with flavor.  The secret sauce on the lamb burger really brings the flavor out of the sandwich.  Also, the French fries are really crispy and good.  For 10 bucks you can't beat it for lunch, this includes a sandwich, fries and a drink.  It's a really good deal and the service is awesome.  Also, I was not a fan of the black bean hummus.  It's hard to describe but the taste was a little off me.  I will definetly be going back there."}
{"text":"Large portions and great food resides at the swanky decorated 5 Church.  I can't remember what was here prior to 5 Church as most restaurants don't seem to last in this location but I know it was not as nicely decorated as it is now.  I've only been for lunch and the chicken sandwich was gigantic and probably a bit much even for my large appetite but it was good, as was the black bean dip appetizer.......looking forward to trying the brunch."}
{"text":"5 church is probably one of the best date and meet up spots in Charlotte for 30+ professionals. I would rate the food 4 stars and the atmosphere 4.5 stars. It is crowded and a little loud on the weekends but worth a stop."}
{"text":"5Church is a Solid Date Night spot. Not too loud, great space, and friendly service. Get the Sea Scallops. Maybe the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. ."}
{"text":"Very nice elegant restaurant, business casual attire is a suggestion. They had a wide selection of wine and I got a glass of ghost pines. The jalapeño butter served with the bread was amazing. I ordered the short ribs which just fell apart they were very delicious, with a side of handout fries. The fries were really fresh and on point. Overall very good from start to finish."}
{"text":"The décor is amazing!!! It doesn't look like it belongs anywhere in the NC I grew up visiting every Summer. I stopped in for brunch with my cousin and sistah-friend while visiting Charlotte. I had shrimp and grits, they were pretty good. My friend and I also shared a lamb burger after we saw how delicious the one my cousin ordered looked. It was very good. Will definitely stop in again during my next trip to the Queen City."}
{"text":"I really really really wanted the food to be awesome because the menu sounds so creative and delicious. But it was just ok for me. Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and it was fabulous! Yummy food and such a neat place the atmosphere is great can't wait to go for dinner there next time!"}
{"text":"5 Church is such a wonderful addition to the Charlotte restaurant scene.  The food is consistently great, the cocktails are interesting and perfect, the ambiance can't be beat. I would DEFINITELY recommend this place to anyone, especially people visiting Charlotte and looking for an uptown experience that's classy & hip, not cheesy."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to mussels but I have the hardest time finding a place who truly can make a great dish. I wasn't anticipating it to be the best dish I've ever had, but I was hoping it wasn't a slump. Welp, one best mussel dish I've ever had later and we're writing a 5 Star Review.   Jamie is outstanding at what he does and the dishes available at 5Church are a must try.  Oh - and anywhere that has complementary valet in Charlotte deserves more than 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Kudos to the owner of the resto, who made our extremely poor service better by comping the whole meal... and then some! Most management would skirt around the truth about what happened, but the owner was up front and honest and did all he could to salvage the rest of our evening. That is how you run a business. And once we got the food, it was delish!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this restaurant because it's owned by a former Top Chef contestant, Jamie Lynch. As a huge fan of the show, when I travel I try to hit up restaurants owned by these contestants. It did not disappoint! The decor was beautiful, and the food was phenomenal. I ordered the shrimp and grits and my friend ordered the lamb burger. We both tried some of each other's food and they were both so good! The best part? A giant glass of sangria was $2.50!!!! Again, I repeat. $2.50!!! That in itself is enough reason to dine at this fine establishment."}
{"text":"Colleen was awesome in hosting our event! Food was delicious, service was great, definitely coming back to host another event! #SoFi"}
{"text":"5Church seems to be a very happenin' place.  The name denotes the intersection where the restaurant is.  There's music, lots of cool-looking people, a great place to hang out for the after-work crowd.    Never one to turn down short ribs, I went for their braised version.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  I'm not exactly sure what the chef's specialty sauce was but I liked it.  It was done right without being too salty.  There was also a choice of potatoes, and I got the fries.  They were perfectly crispy, so I ate the whole lot of them.  Others at my table had the salmon and lamb burger, and they seemed to like their dishes as well.  The meal wasn't cheap, so expect to spend about about $35 each before drinks."}
{"text":"Unbelievable design one of the best salads ever the first 5Church is located in a church in Charleston electricfying atmosphere local IPA's get yourself into some devine intervention."}
{"text":"The highlight of my day was brunch at 5 Church.   The crabcakes with poached eggs were superb.  The presentation was interesting with two stacks comprised of a buttered toast, sautéed spinach, meaty crabcakes, and topped with a perfectly poached egg.  A light sauce with tomato and green pepper garnish finished it perfectly.   Loved the deco...interesting finishes and service was perfect.  This is the kind of culinary experience I have a hard time finding.   I'll be back to try some of their \"snacks\" and dinner entrees."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I had the Crab Cakes and poached eggs which was really great but really small :(   Server was fantastic but the kitchen managed to mess up the order somehow (I watched her write it down so I'm not sure where the error happened) and some of the food was cold. There was also a sewer issue upstairs that had an odor in the restaurant that was not pleasant.   All in all- it was simply ok. Better spots with less odors ?"}
{"text":"My sister and I traveled to Charlotte to attend to some family business. Make no mistake, what we were doing was work. But we made time for meals and the occasional cocktail or three. We Yelped, of course, and found 5Church.   Damn were we lucky to have stumbled onto this gem. It's located just off the Tryon commercial strip that offers a number of upscale chain restaurants. Not what we were looking for, nor were they serving, to our good fortune.  5Church was serving their all day Sunday brunch menu. We sat at corner of the bar where they served the full menu- a limited selection, but with a number of interesting possibilities. I opted for the hanger steak and fries, which came with their own C-1 sauce. It was delicious. The beef was perfectly seasoned and seared. The sauce should be bottled.  Bob, the burly bearded bartender, asked for our drink order. I asked for a margarita with whatever tequila he recommended. Bob asked if I wanted the best margarita I'd ever had. He did not disappoint. He muddled fresh limes and oranges, covered them with ice and simple syrup. Then he added a good measure of (wait for it) Cuervo Gold. Cocktail shaken. Glass rim salted. Drink decanted, fruit and all. Fantastic.  We returned Monday night to our same seats and met Evan, a young mixologist on a mission. After Goose martinis, we extolled Bob's awesome margarita. Evan took that as a challenge and produced a signature cocktail he was perfecting, The Peppadew Pepper Lemonade. Muddled lemons, vodka, Peppedew pepper juice, cayenne pepper. Shake to a froth. Top off with a splash of ginger ale. Garnish with the pepper. Sweet, tart, spicy, refreshing. Delicious.  The food was as good as on Sunday.   We went back two more times in the four days we were in town. We had a lamb burger (me, awesome) and crispy beet sliders (she). I'm not a fan of beets, but the sister loved these fantastic bites. Met the owners who told use they'd been open for just 6 weeks. 5Church should break the curse of other establishments that had failed at the corner of 5th and Church. I'm looking forward to returning as soon as I can find a reason."}
{"text":"Lamb burger.  Eat it now!!!  Service isn't astounding, but the food is quite good."}
{"text":"I've been to 5Church a couple of times now and it's A-OK in my book.   The one thing that stands out to me is the great smelling candle that was burning in the women's bathroom. Aside from that, I'm not sure 5Church is really for me. Clearly it's received great reviews and I quite like it's sister restaurant, Nan & Byron's, but just because I like one sister, doesn't mean they are both alike. The restaurant itself is a bit dark and doesn't have a warm, inviting feel. The first time I was here was during a Yelp event and it was too crowded making the second level hot and stuffy.   This last time I went, I made reservations before a show and they got my guest and I seated promptly. We both ordered the lamb burger and it was good, but it doesn't really work as a burger. We both found it to be messy and ended up eating it with our forks. Also, the energy of the place was dull. Perhaps it was because it was cold outside and during the afternoon. In any case, I just wasn't feeling it. Although, I can definitely see the appeal for an early 20s crowd on a Friday or Saturday night.  The food is good, the location is close if you are seeing a show at the Belk Theater. If, however, you are looking for a more warm and inviting place, try their other restaurant."}
{"text":"In town for work during restaurant week in Charlotte (how lucky am I!?), I opted to check out 5Church my first night there. I had the following from the menu: - Black Bean Hummus - grilled flatbread, cold pressed olive oil - Wasabi-Crusted Salmon - sautéed bok choy, marinated seaweed salad, miso emulsion - Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake - Guinness chocolate cake, peanut butter buttercream, salted caramel sauce, bacon peanut brittle  The hummus was by far the smoothest and tastiest hummus I think I've ever had. I wish I could buy some and take it home with me. The Salmon was cooked to perfection. And the desert was amazing. The only thing I was less than impressed with was the bacon peanut brittle. I know people say bacon is amazing in everything but I would definitely argue otherwise in this case. This was the best meal I had in Charlotte that week. It's too bad I had it at the beginning of my weak rather than the end.   Finally, the decor is comfortable, cool, inviting with an artistic vibe. The service impeccable.   Oh and the Old Fashioned Redone was good too!"}
{"text":"I'd say this was a 4.5 star experience, but am upping it up to 5 because of the service!  Date night Friday and we started with the duck confit perogies. Who puts duck confit on a perogie? 5Church that's who. And they were savory and delicious....But the cheese plate stole the show! I've had a LOT of cheese plates in Charlotte, and this I have to say is THE best cheese plate I've had so far. Why? They put Burrata on the plate that's why! If you don't know what that is, Google it. It will change your life! Then the put a Hungarian style Feta cheese with a tapenade, and a very delicious Italian hard cheese (similar to Parmesean but better) paired with a sweet apricot compote. Wow was that ever delicious combo!  Entree's - my date had the scallops (always good) and I opted for the 14oz bone in ribeye at our Waiter's suggestion. Well he was RIGHT! Good one Doug because the steak was outstanding! Cooked to med-rare perfection and served with their house made Bearnaise sauce! Wow was that like liquid gold.   Dessert - we decided to split one, and Doug our waiter said that their Smores was \"by far\" their best dessert! So we got it, and it was delicious! They said something about a brownie, but it was more like a flourless torte. Who cares, it was AWESOME!  They have a nice wine list, but it is pricey. You may want to see how much their corkage fee is and bring your own bottle of wine when you come. But overall this was a marvelous dinner! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good Tile fish but not great.  Good wine selection and a cool atmosphere.  Just an above average value!"}
{"text":"I am ashamed to admit that I have been to 5Church A LOT and have never written a review.  I think mostly because I'm always so blissful after that I completely forget.  The good news is, I can write about almost every meal - during any time of the day.  Ahh, so much to write and so little time.  5C is one of those places that you not only live for in the city, it's one of those places that you want to show off when people from out of town come to visit you.  There are just so many fun and funky things - the ceiling poetry (Art of War), the cloth wrapped chandeliers, the servers all in chuck taylors, the layered seating, and the people watching - wowza!  5C packs a punch in all the right places.  First things first - make a reservation or prepare to have a nose or two turned up.  It's not a snobby place, but it's busy and reservations are your friend here.    The cocktails are made with care.  I typically stick to an Old Fashion, but there is something for everyone - even the non-drinkers.  Not to mention an espresso bar with homemade biscotti.  Appetizers - the Gnocchi Parisienne (of the day) is an absolute must.  You can share, but just know you are going to want to make love to this pasta.   Each table is also given fresh bread made in- house (swoon).  Entrees - it is impressive, and I mean REALLY impressive to make someone come back for Salmon.  Their wasabi crusted salmon is (my mouth is watering as I type) outrageous.  It is savory and buttery with the ever so smallest hint of heat from the wasabi baked in.  The chef recommends the medium, but I usually do med-well (just my preference) and literally lick my plate clean.  For everything I just said about the salmon, the Prime Beef Bolognese is better.  This is hands down the best pasta I have had on the east coast.  It's surprising, I know.  But I'm Italian and therefore an official authority on the matter and I am telling you this bolognese is to die for.  Like, last meal worthy stuff.  All that said, it's not for the faint of heart - this is a big meal.  Come hungry.  Wondering what else to tack on to that last meal?  The s'mores trifle.  I literally cannot even... it is heaven in a baking dish.     The strawberry poppy seed cake?  Pass.   The service has always been great.  We like to sit at the bar, but on the occasions we have sat in the dining room we have had wonderful service.  Alyssa is wonderful!  5C is killer and you won't regret it.  Just don't get in my way - I would maul someone for that s'mores trifle.  You've been warned.  xoxo"}
{"text":"5Church lives up to the hype. When new locations open in former revolving door space you never know what to expect. 5Church is very on trend and is the type of restaurant Charlotte should be proud of. I was able to sample several things last night since I dined with a group of friends who all shared snacks and small plates. Yes, they have a section on their menu called snacks. See they are fancy smchancy but don't take themselves too seriously. Their servers are dressed fairly casually for the black and white interior and general music video set vibe. I thought the bunch of you guys were just old saying it was loud in there. But, man. I was there for a 7:15pm dinner and I was holloring like I was out at a club to my table-mates.   The Food:  Sampled- Bacon pizza, shrimp flatbread, backed local goat cheese and spinach, meat plate, cheese plate and the heralded lobster mac and cheese.  While some of my friends disagreed I loved the borsin cheese on the shrimp flatbread but I guess it is not for everyone. The bacon pizza was solid- as was the goat cheese albeit small. This is something to know going in. The snacks menu are just that snack size, not appetizer size. The biggest disappointment was the lobster mac and cheese. At $9 for a small bowl I expected angels to sing when it passed my lips. There were noticeable pieces of lobster but they could have been more generous and the mac and cheese could have been more cheesy or strongly seasoned or something. The meat and cheese plates were thoughtful and contained some of the best prosciutto I've ever tasted.  We also shared the chocolate torte and pots de creme which was cold and chai flavored. The latter felt more like a breakfast item than a sweet treat but, it may hit the spot for those that don't like to end their meals with decadence.   I would love to come back and try the 60 second steak or the lamb burger. The cocktails were divine. I would come here again and often for drinks. The free valet parking is nice because parking uptown can be tricky.   I do want to comment on the service. We were celebrating a birthday and mentioned that twice but we made the reservation and I guess they assumed we would want space throughout our meal. Our waitress left our water glasses empty for most of the meal and never once told our friend happy birthday or offered something special for her. It was a special night out but 5Church isn't five stars yet- but it is getting there."}
{"text":"Typically solid food (especially the Lamb burger, pasta dishes, and most appetizers), delicious drinks, and a fun atmosphere. All in, one of our go-to places in uptown."}
{"text":"I don't know what's happened lately. Last Saturday was my 2nd trip to 5Church and while the first was an extraordinary lunch service, the latest  brunch left a lot to be desired.  Arrived around 1pm and was seated by the hostess, we got to our table and our waiter...you know what, I don't think I caught his name. I'm sure he said it but the music was too loud to hear him. On top of that, he really couldn't hear us... at all. Every other thing he said to us was \"what\" or \"could you repeat that.\" It got very annoying throughout the brunch service.  Drinks arrived, I ordered sweet tea... well they didn't lie. It was WAY too sweet. It was almost indiscernible from just sugar syrup, no tea flavor at all. No big deal, I asked the waiter to take that one and bring me a half & half tea to cut the sugar... well 15 minutes came and went and not only had we not ordered yet, but I still didn't have my tea.  Waiter arrived again, without my replacement drink. We placed our brunch order and I waited once again for my drink, which arrived 20 minutes into brunch...  The food arrived and was...OK. My poached egg and crab cake was cooked well but was under-seasoned. My nephew's french toast was good. The Shrimp 'n Grits were good but again, under-seasoned. Nothing horrible, but nothing great.  So after a non-impressive brunch, we waited on the check... and waited, and waited. To note, the restaurant was at about 1/4 capacity... there were at least 4 waiters and waitresses covering about 10 tables. After we finally got the check, it took another 10 minutes for the waiter to come back with the receipt, this time it was a different waiter. I'm not sure if the other one was just tired of my constant requests for drinkable beverage or got tied up on another table. In any case, we really didn't receive a farewell from anyone at the restaurant besides the hostess who said bye to us.  ...so yeah, that's that. It seems like the standards of service were in a free-fall this Saturday. Next visit will probably be with friends who want to go, because I can't see myself going on my own accord any time soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant was so good!! Our server helped us decide on what to order and was very helpful is describing the menu.   We started with the romaine wedge which was delightful and enough for two to share. We also had the pork belly gnocchi which was amazing!! For our main course we had steak with Gorgonzola fondue with mashed potatoes.. Simply amazing! Will definitely be going back again!!  They have a DJ that starts playing on Friday/Saturday nights at 9pm. He was very good. Would be a fun place to meet up and have drinks as well. Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Decor was divine, but it stops there. Service: so-so. The waiter says our po-boy sandwiches dont come with anything on the side. The sandwiches come: with fried potatoes on the side! Our drinks came 3/4 through the meal. Also, the table was not clean. A pet peeve: crunchy, toasted baguettes on a sandwich, which crumbles and scrapes the roof of your mouth. Chefs, please! Leave the baguettes alone. A po-boy should have a nice soft bite."}
{"text":"A little pricey? Sure. But the food is delicious, and the ambiance is quite unique.   The Szechuan pork belly was a great starting bite, the wine list was more impressive than I was expecting, and the salmon with polenta was perfectly tender and delicious - despite the understandable skepticism about smoked and then roasted. And because I'm a huge sucker who can't say 'no' to a dessert, I packed the chocolate torte in every available remaining cranny. Painfully stuffed, but unbelievably satisfied, I almost forgot that I had work to do the next day.  Next time I'm in town, this place will definitely be on my short list."}
{"text":"Another great evening at 5Church. This time rather than the big group, there was just two of us. We sat at the bar. Service was great. Drinks were awesome. Food was excellent. Nice to see that nothing has changed in the 9 months since I was last here. This place is earning a spot on my \"every time I am in Charlotte\" list."}
{"text":"First time to restaurant and was not impressed. Went for lunch with colleague   Had burger with fries. Fries were greasy and cold. Colleague had French onion Roast beef sandwich and left 3/4 as he said tasted funny.  Waitress did not ask if issue nor if we needed any thing else.  Would not go back"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch a few times so far. I love the atmosphere of this place. Very chic. They have different menus depending on the time of day so expect a slightly fancier menu if you come here for dinner. The lunch menu is less expensive ($9-14) and includes a variety of mostly sandwiches.   Off of the lunch menu I've had the chicken honey mustard wrap and the Ruben (they were out of rye bread so I got white). They were ok- nothing to rave about- I would probably try something different next time. Some people with me ordered burgers and they looked awesome. For sides I got fries. The fries were actually pretty good- tasted fresh cut, which I love. I've also had the tomato soup and it was served with a goat cheese filled crouton, which was an awesome touch but the soup was served cold. Not sure if it was sitting out long or was suppose to be chilled.     The true reason why I'm giving this a 3 star is because of the service. Every time I've been here the service has been very slow. Not refilling our water glasses, forgetting silverware or taking ages for our food to come. I don't mind waiting, but when I order a basic burger or sandwich I expect it to not take longer than 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Great food! Fantastic service! Unreal atmosphere! The zucchini sliders were outbid this world! Enough said."}
{"text":"After being here a few times 5Church's offerings continue to leave me unimpressed. How disappointing. Granted this latest time was during the clusterfuck that is restaurant week. Walking in we were greeted and promptly seated which was a nice surprise as we were a bit early for our reservation!  For this visit during restaurant week I started with an asian flair and went for the pork belly bun. It's alright, very big, very filling, the coleslaw helped balance out the richness of that pork belly but nothing really shone through. I think the pork belly was kind of bland, I'm not sure how but I can't even remember it. One of my poor dining companions ordered the split pea soup though and it was unfortunately more water than pea it seemed.  Moving on to the entrees we had a wasabi crusted salmon, and hangar steak. At no point during the order did our waitress ask how we would like either to be cooked. Maybe she was frazzled. I usually like my salmon to be rare, but this salmon was quite on the medium well side which while still palatable was not pleasant with the panko crust on top that somehow actually got softer instead of crispy in the oven. I scraped all that mess off.  Dessert was a super sweet candy bar. I took only a few bites before being overwhelmed and called it a day.  I think next time I come here (which might be a very very long time) I will definitely skip restaurant week's menu. It was tedious and a chore to eat here, the whole point of eating out is to skip the chores!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday Brunch at 11am. Made reservations online. Coffee set up was cute with the pirouette cookies, sugar cubes and jelly bellies. For Brunch we ordered the Apple Smoked Bacon Omelet and the Crab Cakes with Poached Egg. The food was delicious and the ambiance was very chic and fun.  5 CHURCH is located behind the Ivey at the corner of 5th and Church. There have a few on street parking spots but they fill in fast. I have seen rave reviews about the 2.50 mimosas and Sangria but they're not available until after noon so we were a little too early to try them. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I try to go to places a few times before I review them.   I really liked this place before my last visit. I make reservations every time and tend to try a new appetizer and get the same steak.   So I may be to blame for part of this I may not be. I knew ahead of time I would be a few minutes late and called on advance to let them know. I was told no problem. I had requested upstairs as it is a nicer atmosphere and a little quieter than downstairs.   We show up 5 minutes late and they ask us to wait a few minutes. They come back a few minutes later and said it would still be a few minutes. Well finally they take us to a table but low and behold downstairs right between multiple groups of people. No explanation or no asking us if That was ok.   So I'm upset my girlfriend said it would be ok. Then she realized we cannot hear each other talking. The asked us what we wanted to drink and of course out of the one beer I wanted. At this point I was ready to leave but it was my girlfriends birthday so we stayed.  We ordered the chicken wraps ( I did have these once before) and wow they were nasty this time. Whatever spices they used this time was inedible.   She ordered the pasta and said it was ok not great. Ate about half of that and was done.   Now I love their 60 second Strip and wow did they screw up big time. I don't know if they have new cooks or what but half of the steak was inedible. I could not even cut it.  It was way to thick for a strip and not cut properly or anything. Someone really dropped the ball on that one and being a pricey steak you would expect the best.  I got fries this time as a side and they came cold...   Well unfortunately I will not longer recommend this place as That was just a cluster of things gone wrong and they all could have been avoided."}
{"text":"My first and last time coming to this establishment.   Pros : Decor . The decor is beautiful I love the set up its very nice  Cons : *there is no mirror in the women's bathroom  *We were seated in a corner right beside the bathrooms like pure trash  *Our waiter had a party of 10+ right beside us and had no interest in our experience at the establishment. He greeted us poorly. He took forever on bar drinks(we were right in front of the bar to see the drinks being made) & water refills. He did not seem engaging or suggestive to us when asking him questions about the items on the list *It is probably the worst brunch menu that I have ever seen in my entire life *Chicken salad was absolutely disgusting and had a bad aftertaste *my side order of fries& glass of water were probably the best things  *He messed up our checks, but we were so ready to leave that we just paid him and left  *As someone in the food industry, I have never ever ever left a restaurant without leaving at least a 20% tip, until this day     I will never ever come here again and plan to express my experience to others. Please do not waste your time or money. Waffle House has better breakfast."}
{"text":"Okay I can totally see why everyone likes this restaurant. This is a cool place to hang out with your friends at the bar and enjoy the atmosphere. Just others have said in their reviews, it can be a little noisy and its lighting is low but I like it that way as long as you know what it's like going in before hand. The dinner service took longer than most restaurants because they want you to enjoy the appetizers, your drinks and conversations. I took the advice of ordering the black bean hummus with vegetables along with pita chips and it was really good. Our table ordered the bacon pizza which was really good with pork belly spring rolls, I highly recommend it.  I ordered the wasabi encrusted Salmon and I loved it. The seaweed salad was served on top of the salmon which made the crust a little soggy but otherwise it was delicious! I suggest that you should ask for the seaweed salad to be served on the side to keep the salmon crust crunchy.  My wife ordered the prime beef Bolognese and it was rustic, meaty and reminded us of Italy, great job! My daughters ordered the Maryland crab cakes, they had a lot of crab and we're very crunchy. My other daughter got the venison with a reduction glaze, it reminded me of when we had a cordon blue chef from France cook this for us when I was younger, you will love it. All in all a great time, delicious food and a trendy restaurant."}
{"text":"Not much to like about our experience.  Maybe it's just me but if you are going to spend $100 plus on dinner it should be a great overall experience.  Reservations mean nothing, ours was at 8:45, got seated around 9:15 and after speaking to a few people at the bar it was the same for everyone.  Got seated and didn't get a waitress for 5-10 minutes, even though several walked past us.  Honestly she didn't seem too happy to be there.  Food was nothing to write home about, although we had the pre fixe menu for restaurant week so maybe the standards were lower.  I had tuna which tasted ok but servings were small.  Not sure if we will return, but if you like loud music and overpriced food all while getting bad service then try it out."}
{"text":"If I could give them less than 1 star I would.  Service SERIOUSLY sucks - and that goes all the way up the chain.  Nobody cares, everybody says the same thing but nobody takes action to change it."}
{"text":"Hangar steak was tough, pork belly spring rolls were very good. Ordered veggies and didn't get them until we were done eating. Don't think we will return."}
{"text":"I only had calamari, a lamb burger, and a salad so probably a premature review but, the food was not good at all. The waitress was very nice though and there wasn't a wait to sit during lunch. I'll try again for dinner eventually if someone suggests it."}
{"text":"We had a hasty brunch here right before we made a mad dash for the airport because 5Church happened to be open and convenient.  The standout for me was the bottomless sangria, naturally.  It had me at \"bottomless\" and me secretly wishing our flight had been booked for later in the day.  I ordered a mixed green salad and a roti potato cake - it resembled a thick cake of hash browns.  Both were decent and did the trick, but I was a bit sad that the current-at-that-time seasonal menu didn't advertise more veggie-friendly options.  From what I understood, everyone else's selections were fairly competent, although nothing was especially noteworthy.    The service was quite prompt and attentive - you know I tried to inhale as many glasses of that delicious sangria as humanly possible.  Definitely a cute little spot and was great for our large party of 12 or so . . ."}
{"text":"Wow, impressive in every way!  Ridiculously good food and service!  The atmosphere is wonderful!  Extensive wine and cocktail list .  Recommend the steaks and wedge salad.  The red velvet torte is like the best ding dong ever!"}
{"text":"Overall, a really good experience, especially for restaurant week. The salmon was spectacular; perfectly cooked and flavorful. The portion size was quite large yet the dish wasn't heavy. Many recommended the s'mores dessert, which was good but a bit rich for my taste, my date and I agreed that we much preferred the pretzel bar dessert despite our general dislike for pretzels! This is definitely a fun and special place to go, though the booth seating was a bit awkward and uncomfortable, especially while wearing a dress."}
{"text":"Great cocktails (the gin fizz was a hit with both me and my husband) and the little snack plates are a fun way to kick off your meal while you peruse the menu. My husband ordered the catfish and loved it while I got the crispy tofu which was tasty but I'd probably order something else next time which might be saying something. We had great service (very friendly!) and our meals came out fast! Would be a great place to take out-of-towners."}
{"text":"It being St. Patricks Day weekend, most of the restaurants had become Irish pubs for the weekend. Luckily 5Church was not one of these. The atmosphere is upscale and trendy. The music was loud but it was 9pm and it helped drown out conversations around you as the tables are close together. We got a loud guy beside us but that could happen anywhere.   Since we were not overly hungry we split the black bean hummus and a marinated tomato salad to start. The kitchen was gracious enough to split the salad for us. The salad was a tasty surprise. The draft beer selection had something for all beer taste. I always try to go local with the beer when I can.  We opted to split the grilled salmon as well. Again the kitchen split for us. It was still plenty of food. I don't think I could have eaten the whole thing alone. The jalapeño salad on top had a nice kick but had cilantro in it. The salmon was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of tenderness in the middle.   We opted not to get dessert.   On a side note, we did see Ruben Studdard from American Idol fame 3 tables away. We did not bother him as it looked like he and his wife were having an evening out together."}
{"text":"This is about the coolest restaurant in uptown Charlotte.  From the interesting menu options to the decor to the scene itself, this place has it all!   One of the first things I noticed when I walked in for the first time was the words all over the ceiling. Apparently it's the Art of War.  But don't try reading it all or you'll make yourself dizzy!  There are all sorts of other interesting things going on inside this place: the cool lighting, the metal tree beside the bar, the art on the walls, etc.  The food is awesome.  I've had a few different things and haven't found anything that wasn't great.  I really like the tofu dish (and I'm not normally a fan of tofu), and the salmon.  There are also burgers, steaks, chicken options, and other seafood.  They really make some interesting dishes with all sorts of eclectic ingredients.  The cocktail menu is pretty sweet too and it has lots of cool concoctions.  If you make it to dessert without falling out from appetizers and the main course, you'll get to choose from a s'more situation in a glass, banana pudding, and a chocolate peanut butter cake among other things.  All good!    Cool atmosphere in a great location, good food, and not too expensive given the quality.  You gotta check it out!"}
{"text":"Not what you expect from a place that wants to be upscale. The loud music makes it impossible to have a conversation.   The server gave our table a 5 minute sales pitch (or more) when we hadn't taken a look at the menu and was not very knowledgeable when it came to wine (many words were mispronounced among other things). He was very inattentive, got orders wrong, and the food took a very long time. He was not new, if that's what you're thinking. He claimed to be with the company for quite some time.  The food was great though but given my options uptown, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"A-OK sums this place up perfectly.  We went for restaurant week, and oddly enough ended up ordering a bunch of apps (not on the price fix menu)....so major fail on that end.  Reservation was for 6:15...girlfriend arrived at 6, I was there promptly at 6:15.....and we waited and waited and waited for our table.  What is the point of a reservation I ask you.  Now I'm not a fan of pushing people out, but not once as we were sitting at the bar did the hostess check in with us.  We had to go up to her at around quarter to 7 and finally ask what was the story.  This is why I did not give them 4 stars...the hostesses just couldn't be bothered.  Very young and trendy, or what CLT calls trendy, so probably 'ovah' in a bigger market.  But I digress.  Our waiter was also ho hum.  It was loud in there and he had difficulty hearing us.  Instead of perhaps bending down to get a little closer, he rather annoyed like told us to speak louder.  Ok deafy mc deaferson...I'll scream my order next time.  I'm sure the people at the table less than 6 inches from our table will really enjoy that.  So onto the food.  It was good.  The bacon pizza yummy, as was the pierogie.  The salad was just meh as was the jerk chicken wraps.  Dessert was good according to my girlfriend - she got the smores trifle.  I got the red velvet.  I wasn't feeling the chocolate ganache but that's b/c I'm not a chocoholic, not b/c it wasn't good.  The mussels were good but not very large.  So my closing tip to 5 Church...Get rid of the wanna be hipster staff and you'll have a true fan in this yelper."}
{"text":"This place has such amazing food. My girlfriend and I ordered the octopus (as an appetizer) and the  whole fish and scallops meals and they were just absolutely delicious. We sat at the bar and the bartender took such great care of us. He was very professional and nice. Very relaxed environment. In love with the food and will definitely be back on our next visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"So, I am so sad to only give this place 3 stars.  I was really hoping for a 5-star experience with as many awesome things as I have heard about this place....and the buzz about town it has caused the last year.  The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the atmosphere is really cool.  Great place to grab a drink and hang out with friends....  I had been here once before, but only for drinks.  And it was so much fun.  I been waiting to come back and try some of their food and really excited about doing so.  We stopped in late night and we were not super hungry, so we ordered a handful of their \"snacks\" and \"first course\" items.  I didn't like any of them.  So much so, that I barely touched my food.  Everything was crazy salty and over seasoned.   One of the items, \"the black bean hummus\" is described on the menu as coming with \"grilled flat bread\"...and what I got was greasy fried chips.  When I asked the server about it, he told me it was grilled and then \"flash fried\".  Doesn't make much sense to me.   I sure hope their steaks and main dishes are better.  Maybe I will try them out again.  Or maybe I will just stick with the bar."}
{"text":"This is one of my fav restaurants in Charlotte - modern, upscale but not uptight. Great food and energy. And, if you want a fab cocktail, I highly recommend the Viper. You're welcome."}
{"text":"The Lamb burger was tasty, but nothing over-the-top-hell-yea-lamb-be-damned good.  I love the decor with all the crazy writing on the ceiling.  The place was empty after 3, I think they stop serving lunch right at 3, they were cool and mad ean exception for me and my buddy bc we had been to 3 other places and they all stopped lunch.  Come on Charlotte! Keep a food menu open the entire day! sheesh."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  We had an awesome server named Andrew which did a fantastic job not only serving us but creating an experience.  He made suggestions from cocktails to dessert which were all absolutely delicious.  The New York Strip may be the best steak I have ever eaten.  Cooked to perfection!  It's been a long time since I have received that kind of service and quality.  I left there a raving fan and will definitely be going back and requesting Andrew!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at 5Church the other night.  We had a reservation and were seated immediately.  We had our 12 and 13 year old kids with us.  The food was great.  All of us were happy with our choices.  Service and drinks were great too.  I am glad we dressed up because the majority of diners were dressed up as well.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Second time I had been in two weeks for work related lunches. First time food and service were good. Second time the food was still good but service terrible. We were a party of three and it took almost 40 minutes to get club sandwiches and side salads. We all ordered the same thing and there were maybe 15 other patrons dining at the same time.  We asked the waiter to bring our checks when the food came out and he didnt. I ended up having to get my food boxes up since I was there longer than should have been along with requesting my check again, which took another 10 minutes.  It was quiet and food wasn't complicated...no plans to go back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"After living in Manhattan the past five years, I was skeptical that a \"trendy\" restaurant (in Charlotte, no less) could have great food.  I was pleasantly surprised and will be sure to book a dinner reservation later, next time, in order to absorb the music, beautiful people, and the scene.    There are two levels to the restaurant--- one with bar and dining; the other with all dining.   I sat upstairs with my mom- her first time out since a serious operation.   Noise level, even when the place was full (after 7:30) was not a problem.  And, the free valet outside was perfect.  The waitstaff  was very knowledgable, patient and even excited  to answer numerous questions regarding the menu.  To start, there were so many interesting choices on the cocktail list.  I  decided on the Bourberry- a bourbon based drink with rasperries that I LOVED--- and, I am not even a bourbon drinker.  I ordered from the  \"snacks,\" section -  pork belly, chickpea salad, and toasted ravioli- (approximately $3- $4 each and enough bites for two).  My mom got a kick out of the fact that I created my own \"tasting menu,\" which it was.  Although  initially saying that she would not eat any of my \"snacks,\" she enjoyed.   I ordered a salad (dressing on side, as an added bonus I received two) and my mom ordered the seared sea scallop entree--- which we both loved!!! The scallops were large and juicy, displayed beautifully on leek mashed potatoes with yummy tomato, corn, and zucchini salad.  I ended up eating most  of her veggies (and scallops as well).  We also split the shrimp, arugula, flatbread pizza appetizer.  The crust was so perfectly dietetically thin, that the true shrimp, arugula, red onion, and boursin cheese flavor took over--- heaven to a foodie.  We were so full (and my mom tired) that we did not get to desert.  I can't wait to go back next time to try  more of their menu and also hit up the scene downstairs."}
{"text":"We're in town from Winston Salem for a show and made reservations here for brunch.   Started with a Bloody Mary and sangria. Bloody was good a peppery, the sangria was excellent, a red sangria w berries, really tasty. The ms had waffles and I had crab cake w poached eggs. Both were fantastic. Ms said the waffle was the best she's ever had. I think she was right. My meal was excellent. We had home fries that were perfectly seasoned to soak up the egg goodness.    Great location for a show at blumenthal   Great brunch. We'll be back for beauty and the beast in the Fall"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch spot. Super cute decor! Hey you can't go wrong with bottomless mimosa and sangria for brunch! The food is cheap and pretty good! Ladies this is the place to get your girls together for drinks and convo! #SexandCityVibe"}
{"text":"Sat down for a quick business luncheon with a customer.  The service was great, the Calamari appetizer was good, the French Onion Roast Beef sandwich was delicious.  Excited to return for dinner in the near future!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since it opened, we finally got the opportunity last weekend. We decide to go as part of restaurant week. I never am sure what to expect during restaurant week. We have been to restaurants before during this time and the menu has been tweaked (small portions, very limited choices). 5church had a decent selection.  I opted for the tomato soup, hanger steak, and banana walnut cake, my wife had the Bibb salad, hanger steak, and chocolate torte.  All was good including the complimentary everything bread.  Stand outs were the medium rare hanger steak, Bibb salad and chocolate torte.  My next visit I will have to get the bison sirloin or the lamb burger.  The restaurant had a cool trendy vibe and would be nice for just a drink at the couches or bar area. The only complaint I have is the noise level, since there we just 2 of us, we were seated at the large community table that seats 18.  It happened to be in front of the bar so it was extremely loud, however I plan on going back for lunch soon."}
{"text":"We recently had the pleasure of celebrating our wedding reception at 5Church Restaurant, 06-10-17 to be exact. Alexa (event coordination) Erin (management) and the team left me speechless. Talk about rolling out the red carpet. Alexa and Erin are so personable, patient, fair and kind. Alexa met with us multiple times until I was comfortable, left no stone unturned and most importantly she listened. She works smart to ensure that no details are missed! Erin fed us until we were stuffed at the delicious food tasting and even spotted me outside the day before to help carry decorations inside.  On our big day, we were dashed to our own private area to eat & have alone time before greeting guests. They also left us such thoughtful notes and gifts as well. Not to mention checking on us throughout the event asking if we needed drink refills, food., etc. We were able enjoy our guests and did not have to think!  Chef Jamie whips up a delectable brunch menu. Steak, tuna poke, mushroom flatbread (my fav), steak, chicken and waffles and shrimp & grits - YUM. Also, the decor in the restaurant is very modern, clean & classy.  This venue makes for a phenomenal party. I highly recommend booking 5Church for your next event!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed every visit and had my wedding reception here. The food and customer service are phenomenal! Alexa and Erin really took care of us!"}
{"text":"The brunch was so good! Not only did it look good, but everything tasted good as well! The only thing that would have improved my experience would have been not being seated under the A/C, as the A/C is constantly on at 5Church because the building is 100+ years old. I'm definitely coming back, but requesting a seat that's not under the A/C!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family for Mother's Day. I'm not from the area so I relied upon other reviews to chose this place. It's nice and trendy and the good was very good. I'd recommend this place for drinks with friends more so than family. The bartender/server upstairs was a cool guy.  Watch out for the Viper cocktail. That drink has bite!"}
{"text":"Yikes! I really hate to give anything one star unless it's absolutely warranted----and, in this case, it was.  I went with my family for a quick lunch at 1:00. We waited about 5 minutes to be greeted and were finally sat. (The restaurant had maybe 6 tables occupied).  Once seated, we waited about 10 minutes to give drink orders - 2 unsweetened teas, a glass of wine, a beer and a water-- we decided to go ahead and order our mains to speed up the process. Finally, we ordered a side of chips to arrive as an appetizer. My sister and mother are vegetarians and specifically requested that their spinach salads came with the vinaigrette dressing instead of the garlic bacon dressing (they also shared that they were vegetarian at this time).   About 20 minutes later, our water pitcher was empty, unsweetened teas had been consumed and, wine and beer were gone. We flagged over our waiter who apologized for \"difficulties\" but assured us \"everything was on track\" and that our chips would be out soon as well as a manager. 5 minutes later, the manager plopped down soggy cold chips and walked away (leaving all drinks empty and never apologized/ tried to make things right). Our waiter finally brought the meal about an hour after we sat down and, unfortunately we noted that all three salads were totally covered in bacon.  (I re looked at the menu and no where does it mention the spinach salad come with bacon) My mother and sister sent the salads back before they were even placed in front of them and told our waiter they didn't want  anything more--- they'd lost their patience and left to walk up the street for wraps.  The waiter apologized and said the manager would be back to talk to us. The manager (I assume) came over a few mins later with two new salads and tried to offer them however, my mom and sister were gone. He huffed and walked away without apologizing.  My salad which was covered in bacon was 1 star - portion was small and chicken was not very good. However, my husband and dad enjoyed their lamb burger and beef burger respectively.  To top off the bad experience, it took the manager at least 12 minutes to get us the check. Stay away from this place if you can- and a note to management-- get it together, acknowledge when you've made mistakes and, make things right (don't hide from us and pretend nothing happened) $70 for a poor lunch --- woof !"}
{"text":"5Church certainly has a lot of hype.  It seems to pride itself on being glamorous and chic.  In my opinion, the food puts way more emphasis on form then taste. Great example, is a scallop dish was plated incredibly fancy, but the scallops were under-cooked and the favors didn't meld well.  All in all, the dish fell flat.   They did have some good small plates - think tapas - and that is the only thing that prevented it from getting one star.   If you want a fancy place with bad food, this is the spot for you. If you like tasty food, I'd look somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant a couple of times for lunch and once for dinner.  Every time the experience has been amazing. All of their dishes are full of flavor &  desserts are Delightful!  Lunch: I have tried their CHICKEN CORDON BLEU for lunch. Perfectly crusted chicken, the mashed potatoes were super creamy & topped with delicious lemon caper butter sauce.  Dinner: This place gets really packed during evenings but you can grab a drink or two at the bar.   We started our dinner with ROASTED BEET SALAD & BLACK BEAN HUMMUS. The salad was Marvelous, hummus was ok. I ordered HERB-BRINED & ROASTED CHICKEN, this dish was one of a kind & perfectly cooked. My husband ordered WASABI CRUSTED SALMON it was flavorful.   We finished our meal with ESPRESSO FROZEN MOUSSE & S'MORES TRIFLE. Best ever! Yummy."}
{"text":"I went here today with a couple of friends of mine from work. I ordered the $10 lunch special that includes a sandwich, a side of fries and a drink. Food was good.  Definitely worth the $10. The highlight of the meal though, was the absolutely divine flourless chocolate cake, served espresso creme, salted caramel and toasted hazelnuts. I almost licked my plate clean.  I didn't quite get the theme of the decorations of the place but I didn't mind it. The ambience was pretty good. Seating was comfortable and almost private.   Overall, a great experience, I definitely will go back again for the dessert.   I give 5church a 4 star rating. I didn't give it 5 simply because of the not so great first time experience with them."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with family. Service was attentive. Had a weird water taste in one of my pitchers.. I'm not picky but maybe they didn't rinse well or something.  Local beers on tap (had the local kolch) was good.  Most of the stars Goto the ambience and potential for a friend get together with tapas or appetizers and drinks.  Dinner... Was ok.I had the pork chop and it was a little undercooked. The sides were good, the mashed potatoes were delicious. That's my other star.  Bottom line: dinner was good not great. Music was a little loud for intimate dinner with family. Ambience was wonderful and modern. Meeting for drinks with friends and appetizers would be great!"}
{"text":"We had dinner Saturday night at 5Church. We had 8:30 reservations and were seated right away. The decor was stylish, tasteful and the restaurant was packed with a young hip crowd.    Service was great throughout the night. Our waitress greeted us within minutes of being seated and promptly took our drink order and described the nightly specials.  We started with a bottle of pinot noir, a beet salad and bowl of tomato soup with fried goat cheese. All were very tasty.  For entrees we went with two of the nightly specials, the Wagyu ribeye topped with a southern crab cake and a bearnaise sauce and the seared diver scallops over polenta.    The Wagyu steak was a big big big disappointment. Especially after hearing our waitress describe how tender, juicy and flavorful it was going to be. Mine was everything but good. I order it medium rare. It arrived closer to medium. Wagyu is expensive, so I expected a small cut. However, I was very surprised when a 6-7 oz steak arrived. For $56 dollars, I expect little more. Worse, my steak was tasteless, chewy and tough. No flavor at all. The crab cake was a bit on the fishy side and the bearnaise was served room temperature. Simply put.....it was terrible.   The scallops were much better, well cooked but only seared on one side. The polenta was flavorful and perfectly seasoned.   Overall, 5Church was good, but not great. We really wanted it to be great. We plan to give it another try in hopes that it will be better on our next visit."}
{"text":"Private event for corporate business:  Hello from sunny Florida! After scrutinizing many restaurants in the Charlotte area for the most unique and creative restaurant, known for great, seasonal and also creative menus, that HAS a private dining room and is NOT a chain and easily accessible....all roads led to 5Church.  Their decor and ambiance are impressive and strikingly different from others, the private dining room (upstairs) has a fabulous view of the main dining room below. It also has it's own private bar and a DJ booth (if that's something that you need).... but most importantly and justly notable are the staff and the FOOD!!!   Let's talk about the STAFF: The group sales associate, Alexa, was such a pleasure to work with and was extremely helpful throughout the booking and planning stages for my VIP corporate event. Correspondences were very clear and came very promptly which is extremely important to me. Just as important is the service to my clients at execution. Angela and Taylor were our servers for the evening and I was floored by their excellent service coupled with their charming personalities and warm hospitality. These ladies are wonderful at what they do and seemed very happy to be there too! There was never a moment of tension or unease I felt from these ladies, not a glimmer of them feeling stressed or pressured in any way (although, we were a pretty easy-going group to handle in the first place).   . . .and finally the FOOD: The timing of each entree were delivered with logistical and operational perfection. Every dish, every taste, were satisfying to all the senses. As I looked around the room that evening after each entree served, there was clear evidence that I was not the only person that loved the food, as I found every person in my group had a clean plate. No leftovers, nothing pushed to the side. Clean. I still dream about the Wasabi Crusted Salmon dish that I was served. Can I please have that recipe, Alexa???   I want to give everyone at 5Church a jumping hi-five for a perfect evening and BIG hugs to Angela and Taylor...and on a more personal note: Whoever approved the design for all the words of 'Art of War' to be written throughout the ceiling and having Converse sneakers as an approved uniform footwear for its' staff needs to be given a shout out as well. You are awesome, my friend, and yet one more reason why I LOVE 5Church."}
{"text":"Round two! I came again last night after making an Open Table reservation for my boyfriend and a client who was in town from San Francisco. I was impressed by the food last week and decided to give it another whirl- interesting menu options and great ambiance. We were a little late (10-15 minutes) but they didn't blink an eye- our table was ready for us and we were greeted right away by our server. Definitely an improvement from last time! We ordered the mussel appetizer (delicious) and I had the scallops (was torn between that and the NC flounder) and BF got the famous lamb burger. Everything was delicious. Our server was super nice and delivered everything quickly, wasn't obtrusive yet friendly. All in all, great dinner. I think our company enjoyed it very much, too."}
{"text":"This is a short review.  Went in mid day on a Sunday, party of three.  Hostess greeted immediately and seated.  We waited TEN minutes, and never were acknowledged by another employee.  We decided that if that was the expectation of service that we would pass, and went across the street to Cowbell."}
{"text":"5 Church has been my favorite restaurant since they opened their first location right down the street from where I live here in CLT. I can't even count how many times I have visited and I would write a 5 star (10 stars if I could!) review for each and every visit - I have never been disappointed. The ambiance and decor is second to none, check out the ceiling when you visit, it's something you don't want to miss!  The drinks are always on point with a friendly and knowledgeable bar staff that is able to answer any questions you may have. Last night, the bartender walked me through each bourbon they carried and what flavor profiles I could expect from each one. Amazing!   The service is all around incredible at 5 Church. I have had many, many servers throughout my visits and have always been impressed with their knowledge and attentiveness. Over time, I have come to have a favorite server named David, he knows everything about the menu and ensures everyone at the table is enjoying theirselves. David is such a good server that I have chosen to wait additional time just for a table in his section - make sure to request him!    Now, the food. I am always speechless. I have tried many things on the menu but my favorite (my partners favorite as well) is the 60 Second Prime NY Strip. The flavors that are captured by this dish are incredible. I have visited all three 5 Church locations (others in Charleston and Atlanta) and still always order that steak.   I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone that asks for recommendations, and trust me it is often. Since being a concierge at the Ritz-Carlton, to managing retail stores, I have had lots of opportunity to work with CLT residents and visitors alike and 5 Church is always top of the list for suggestions.   Last night was my most recent visit and I'm already craving it again! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I tried out 5Church last night (1-25-14) thanks in part to restaurant week. My friend had arranged for reservations and when we both arrived, we were seated right away. The lighting was a lot darker than I expected and we kept getting a huge gust of cold air due to the fact that we were seated near the entrance.   As a part of the restaurant week menu, I ordered the tomato soup as an app, grilled hanger steak (medium) for entree, and smore's trifle for dessert. For a drink, I ordered a glass of sauv blanc (which was delicious and crisp). The tomato soup was my favorite portion of the meal. It had a hearty consistency, topped with a long, thin crispy bread that was coated with cheese and pesto. It was the perfect utensil for dunking in the soup. The hanger steak was a little chewy for my liking, (I'm not the biggest steak fan though), served with a potato risotto which was perfectly fine. The smore's trifle was good but very sweet! I tasted more chocolate flavor than graham cracker or marshmallow.  The most notable aspect of our meal was the attentiveness of our waitress and other waitstaff. Like, EXTREME attentiveness. They all take the job seriously of re-filling your water glass(es), bringing new utensils, 'fluffing' your napkins, and making sure that you're enjoying your meal(s). In a restaurant as busy and as popular as 5Church, the staff makes you feel like you're populating the only table."}
{"text":"First let me say the food at 5Church was great. We tried the hummus appetizer and the pork belly appetizer, and they were both very tasty. The salmon and chicken entrees were also very delicious. However, the atmosphere wasn't really my style. We're in our mid-30s, and most of the diners were in their early 20s; the girls were decked out in 5 inch stilletos and micro minis and the guys were in suits. The decor is very modern, and the music felt like house music with some serious bass. As much as I loved the food, I felt really old! Looks like it's definitely a great new hotspot in uptown... I may just need to stick to lunch."}
{"text":"Basically as lackluster as you can get for such a great location.  I live in the building and have been disappointed time and time again.  Slow service. Blah food that often comes out the wrong temperature. There are too many better options uptown to waste calories and money here.  What totally kills it for me is that the parking garage that it is attached to reeks of garbage and it is noticeably stinky in the restaurant. It smells of old beer and dirty restaurant floor, but I'm pretty sure it's the garage.  One nice thing:  they have Jordan Chardonnay."}
{"text":"bottomless sangria and mimosa brunch. enough said. ... good food too."}
{"text":"The decor was lovely...drinks were fab. Wasn't particularly crazy about the menu. Had been hearing such wonderful things, but was slightly disappointed. I love fancy food, but  just didn't find anything small that sounded appetizing and didn't have pork or an expensive price tag that I felt was worth it. I did try the lobster mac and cheese, which was quite tasty! The service was great though. Nice spot for friends to hang out or a date. But I would stick to drinks only. Just my opinion :)"}
{"text":"Good food and vibe,l but stay away from the monkfish"}
{"text":"I've been to 5Church for brunch three times now and the brunch menu is one of the best I've ever seen. Though the menu is not necessarily long, every single item on there sounds fantastic. In my three visits, I've ordered something different every time. The brunch burger is amazing!! Definitely the best hang over meal. The crab cakes and poached egg is also to die for- definitely lighter than the brunch burger if that's what you're feeling! I also have tried the mushroom omelette and it was also really good-- the breakfast potatoes that came with the omelette were the best part. Oh yeah, make sure to order the double mimosas! The mimosas were great but last time I ordered a mojito and didn't enjoy it as much. As for the ambiance, this place has one of the best decors I've ever seen! Definitely gives off a super chic and posh vibe. Overall, 5church is a great restaurant. I haven't been for dinner but I'm sure it wouldn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Came here last saturday night and had a good time. It was crowded but that was expected since this is one of the most popular restaurants in uptown charlotte. The restaurant is designed really well with a ton of detail. I had their signature lamb burger but I wasn't impressed. If I had another chance, I would order a different meal."}
{"text":"Disappointing evening at 5 Church!   Service was terrible.  On a bright note the cauliflower soup was very good.  However, the rest of the meal was a disaster.  I had the roasted chicken which had good flavor but it was not hot.  The mashed potatoes were practically cold.  My husband's hanger steak was also served cold.  For desert, I was supposed to get a brownie with toasted marshmallow on the side.  Without any explanation, they decided to serve it with ice cream, not what I ordered.  Will not be back.  Even the decor is looking a bit tired, there were rips in the seating."}
{"text":"I LOVE the decor here! (Esp the handwrittings on the ceiling) Ive been really excited to tryout their brunch since I heard it's really good! Our waiter was really friendly, everyone here is really friendly lol! The food took a while to come out, and when it did it wasn't warmed, it felt like it had been sitting out for a while. I had the waffles w/ the chia syrup & oh lord it tasted like straight up Christmas!! I was so shooked, I really like the caramelized fruit that it came with. I tasted some of my cousin's crab Benedict, it was good but like I said it wasn't warmed up and seafood starts to taste fishy when it's cool down. I think I would come back to tryout their dinner menu because I really enjoyed the ambience here but the location that it's located in isn't ideal for me!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and was so happy with the choice! The ambiance is a cool, hip, contemporary vibe. U have to check out the ceiling! As for the food, it was perfect!! We had a variety of things from steak, chicken, salad, pizza and everything was fantastic! Great flavors and presentation! The drinks were awesome as well. The only thing we didn't love were the indian pierogis but everything else, including the dessert was spot on!"}
{"text":"Exceptional. This is possibly the best work lunch I have had in Charlotte. Food is great and decor is amazing. The detail and care given to the food can be seen as soon as the plate lands in front of you. From the first to last bite, it does not disappoint in the complexity and correctness of flavours.  Went with a party of 4 on 7/13/2012. I had my eyes on this place when they opened, but they only had dinner service. By chance, I learned they started serving lunch and got a group of friends to go. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food, four different entrees.  The only remote thing that was poorly executed during lunch was the wait staff's attention. It seems like they might have just recently started lunch service and we had to ask a waitress to come take our order. But when the actual food came, that was long forgotten.  If you enjoy good food, this place is a must visit in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Tried 5church on a Saturday night with my bf, didn't make a reservation so we had to wait about 20 minutes but the time passed quickly as we sat at the bar, enjoyed a drink and the ornately decorated interior.  It was restaurant week so we got to order three course meals for $30 (or so we thought...had a few hidden fees including $7 bottle of water and $7 up charge for filet which was not mentioned on the menu or by the server)  The service was very slow and the server was unapologetic for the amount of time that passed between courses. She did little to enhance the dining experience in the mean time and messed up our appetizer order but corrected it with out any remorse.  I thought maybe it was because we were sitting outside and therefore easily forgotten but the tables around us were getting an average amount of attention. Then we thought it was because we were younger and perhaps she thought we didn't have much money to throw around. Whatever the reason, the experience was not a good one which is a shame because the food is very very good (and a bit pricey). As a vegetarian, the only dish I could have was the fried tofu and kimchi, but it was great! Very different, very tasty.  Next time we are in Charlotte, we will be trying other places before returning to 5church."}
{"text":"We ended up at 5Church after the Liverpool vs AC Milan match. It was absolutely packed and the wait was 30-45 minutes for inside seating. They had tables available outside that weren't being used so we asked to sit outside.   Honestly, the staff seemed completely overwhelmed EXCEPT for our 2 waitresses who appeared to be tag teaming the outdoor tables. We ordered appetizers that the runners ended up taking to the incorrect table and didn't realize it. We ended up getting the Calamari and lettuce wraps after our entrees came out but the comped them so it was fine.  The real stars were our lamb Burger and Bolognese. Absolutely amazing"}
{"text":"Good food but over priced. The lamb burger was good. My friend had the chicken and another had the steak. I think there menus is limited and your meal only comes with one side. And additional side is 8 dollars."}
{"text":"I've only ever been for brunch and definitely like it. The sangrias and mimosas are only $2.50 and the atmosphere is so cute! Which they had some cool benedicts on the menu. Also a tip, you can sub out toast for a biscuit. It may cost more but it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Updated review: came back to 5church for restaurant week (unknowingly) and then for dinner again when some friends were visiting from out of town. Both experiences were good. We got a proper table this time, the drinks were decent, I'm not a huge fan of the crushed nuts on the rim of the old fashioned, but the bourberry I think it's called was really good. The food was delicious, obviously well plated, I would say I thought the appetizers were a little small portion wise, the lobster starter we ordered was maybe 3 bites max. But again, quality was great, service was good for the most part for a busy restaurant."}
{"text":"First let me explain that I am picky eater! With that being said, I always view the menu online so I know what I am getting ahead of time. This is exactly what I did, but unfortunately the website menu was not updated (according to the waiter it had not been updated in about 1 year).  After a let down and endless questions, I FINALLY pick what I want. A few moments later our waiter informs me that they do not have the  pasta to make that specific dish.  so back to the drawing board.   Eventually I just asked for the  manager; who was SO professional, nice and understanding! We ended up creating a dish that I knew I would enjoy. Everyone in our party enjoyed the food and the DJ was great! He even shouted out the birthday girl in our group!"}
{"text":"So I came to 5Church with some of my girls...it was great! We snacked on the local heirloom tomato risotto, chilled asparagus, crisp Szechuan pork belly, artisan cheese selection and the roasted mushroom gnocchi. Everything was great!!! This place is very cool, young & old mixed!...even Cam Newton was here. Check it out, great food, atmosphere and drinks... Come enjoy it as much as me & my friends have!!! Good eats!! -SK"}
{"text":"Where to start?!! Amazing atmosphere! Great service! Our server was Grace and she was always there to greet a new guest at our party. The crab cakes are insane with hardly any filler I could taste. The 60 second steak is a must try if you enjoy a rare steak.  Calamari and the shrimp flat bread were a few of my guests favorites at the party as well.  One of the best bars and restaurants you can go to in uptown to get an amazing wine list or classy cocktail without breaking the bank. There really is something on the menu for everyone. I can't wait to back with a group of friends. Thank you 5Church for a hosting a great evening!"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to have dinner at 5Church on Saturday night. It is my new favorite; the food and service was some of the best I have ever experienced.  I had the scallops and they were incredible; everything on the plate had a role to play. My wife very much enjoyed the filet. The filet had a perfect crust on each side and was cooked to temp perfectly.   The corn soup was also perfectly balanced with a rich creamy texture.   I find myself craving the soup and scallops now. Can't wait for our next visit. All the recognition and awards 5Church has received is well deserved."}
{"text":"Ever eaten inside a work of modern art before?  Well this is about how it would feel.  Not only is the food spectacular New American cuisine, but the decor is splendid.  We sat a a small table for two.  The small table was made of concrete that was made to look as if it had a table cloth draped over it.  The server had to tell is to be careful because it was concrete and not cloth.  Details abound and I can say that the chicken dish and the bison steak were both great."}
{"text":"The wait was a bit long for our food during lunch time. This was a bit concerning as the restaurant was empty when we arrived. Overall, the food was delicious once it arrived. The baby spinach salad tasted well, nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find. Its on the corner of 5th and Church (hence the name), not on Tryon St. Super hip and stylish decor. The food was good. Visited for dinner on a Tuesday night and the place was packed. Looks like a great place to host large parties since most of the tables were packed with 10-15 people. My friend and I had the bacon pizza, shrimp flatbread, short ribs (super tender) and the bistro steak. For dessert, the s'mores trifle. Everything was really tasty. I would definitely visit again if I'm in town. PS the staff is all eye candy. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First visit to 5church Charlotte, love it  I have been to the location in Atlanta twice and these guys really have it together  Beautiful restaurant, food is outstanding and friendly staff I hope to visit the other location in Charleston  Love the 5church"}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the location. I love the atmosphere. On the many occasions I have been to 5Church, my experiences have always been up to par. The one time I had a not so great experience, the management was quick to fix it and actually made me want to come back. The food is creative and delicious. The staff knowledgeable about the dishes and the wines that are served. I highly recommend this place to all my friends... oh, and especially for Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Yes, this restaurant is really as good as people say it is. Although I was initially shocked by the clear plastic lawn chairs at the dining room tables, everything else about the experience was absolutely perfect. Except for maybe our too-cool-for-school server in his converse high-tops and skinny jeans. But I will totally overlook that because he was somewhere nearby when we needed him. Albeit with a totally blasé look on his face. But our orders were perfect and we wanted for nothing.  We met some friends for dinner after the DNC cleared out of town and, truthfully, fourth ward was eerily empty. No worries ... plenty of room at the bar to enjoy a cocktail before dinner. Everything from drinks to snacks to entrees to desserts (we had 3...) were absolutely delicious. There was not one less than perfect plate of food that was placed in front of us. And, not surprisingly, every plate was sent back to the kitchen perfectly cleaned. Szechuan pork belly, beet slider, mussels, cheese plate, salmon, grouper ... you name it, we devoured it.  I cannot wait to go back and try out some more of their amazing food and lounge out in the plastic lawn chairs with friends."}
{"text":"The ambience is good but the portions are tooooooo small given the high price (you can finish the ravioli is three bites). The 60 sec NY steak isn't too good as well. Don't recommend it at all!!!"}
{"text":"Had some drinks and appetizers at the bar- really enjoyed ourselves! Customer service was fab- great suggestions from the staff as far as what to order and held nice conversation. Nice decor inside as well. looking forward to going back and having dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Service was okay, food and drinks were way overpriced for the amount you got. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Superb food and service. We went here for restaurant week and it was fantastic. I recommend the Vietnamese Meatballs, Scallops, Ahi Tuna Poke (huge portion!), or Wasabi Tuna-- I guess I recommend anything! I would, and will, come back when the items are full price because the quality of the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Been to 5 Church twice. First time with another couple who picked this restaurant as one of the choices to go to. 2nd time was on my birthday when we had plans to go to another restaurant which turned out they were closed. 5Church is just ok for me. To be honest, I wasn't impressed with it the first time and after the 2nd time definitely wouldn't go back. Its one of those Charlotte restaurants that their ambience prevails over their food. For the price and the attempt to please the sophisticated palate, I'd go elsewhere. I had scallops the first time there (it was okay- not memorable) and steak 2nd time. My steak and my son's pork chops both had the same \"barbecue\" tasting sauce all over it. For a price tag of $26 and it does not include sides other than the piece of meat sitting on top of mash potatoes and one broccoli. Cocktails were average $12 and not top shelf."}
{"text":"Before going to a show at the Belk Theater, six of us went to dine at Five Church.  The only slight complaint was the table where our party was seated, near to the front door, especially when the reservation was made several days in advance.  The service was outstanding.  We had the bacon pizza, pork belly snack, and mussels for appetizers.  All were very good.  The tomato sauce over the mussels was excellent.  We had 6 different entrees, all delicious.  My flounder was very good.  My taste of the duck, hanger steak, and short ribs was also very tasty.  Very nice experience!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day with the ol lday and had the Lamb Burger. I can say it was mediocre\" probrolly due to the fact that grease was running everywhere. Couldn't hold the burger and eat it-Had to cut it in half. When I cut the burger in half all of dressing and patty fell apart. Maybe I'll try something less messy next time."}
{"text":"The service was amazing along with the food. If you're looking for a place to wine and dine, this is the place. The manager is exceptional and came to make sure everything was going well. We even got champagne on the house because my friends got engaged. They made them feel so special, which is great."}
{"text":"This is not the place if you're looking for great food. Their cocktails are fab! The atmosphere is trendy and cool.   We ordered a table full of appies. Mussels, meatballs, lettuce wrap, pierogies and Brussels sprouts with bacon.   Mussels and Brussels sprouts were actually pretty good, not amazing. The meatballs, pierogies and lettuce wraps were incredibly dry and flavorless!   Us being big dessert people, we thought maybe if we ordered 2 of the waitress' favs, this place could redeem itself. We got the white chocolate cheesecake and the red velvet. Boy were we disappointed. Both had a lingering flavor of sitting in the fridge uncovered.   All in all, we would not return unless only to have cocktails!   **warning**  DO NOT ORDER FOOD HERE, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"5church has great service and atmosphere and that's where it ends.  The food is just not good.  We came for brunch. The menu reads very well but the execution is poor.  Biscuits are dry and hard, chicken salad is dry and flavorless.  The person sitting next to our table had to send back their lamb burger for some reason and ordered something else.  I feel as though this place would be a great nightlife spot for cocktails but the food needs a lot of help."}
{"text":"Came back to Charlotte and happened upon 5Church again, this time for brunch around 2pm on a Saturday. The place is not nearly as banging in the daytime but the food was still fanstastic and the service was great.   If you like boozy brunches, they offer a $10 all-you-can-drink sangria brunch special which was tempting...but I didn't want to be on the floor the rest of the day. We had fantastic food including an omelet, shrimp and polenta (with the BEST tomato gravy I've ever had...amazing!!!), extra homefries, and the crab cake benedict. YUMYUMYUM. The food was great and hit the spot- right on.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Went here twice on my trip to Charlotte. On Friday night, the boyfriend and I went to a late dinner. We immediately felt under dressed - this seems more the type of place where the uber hip go to meet. The ambiance is strange - trying a little too hard to be New York when were were looking for more authentic Charlotte.    Our server was friendly and attentive, even when he was seated with a loud eight top right after we sat down. We had the hanger steak and a trout dish - both were good but nothing to write home about.   Saturday night we were joining a birthday party and knew more of what to expect. Although we had to fight hoards of men wearing bedazzled t-shirts, the drinks and the music were good."}
{"text":"Really like the ambience. Food is ok, good local beers on tap."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch with our new airport friend who lives  in the area. The place is very spacious and has a chic industrial vibe, with exposed pipes and slate color walls. The blackboard ceiling was a very cool touch and I was a bit dizzy trying to read all of the writing up there. We arrived a bit late for our noon reservation, the place was pretty busy so reservations are definitely recommended. The host was very nice and so was our server, she patiently answered all of our questions and gave recommendations. We were all very hungry and everything sounded delicious so it was hard to make a decision, we ended up ordering the buttermilk biscuit, shrimp and grits, crab cakes, French toast and a side of bacon. The food took a while but we were enjoying our mimosas so we didn't mind. All of the dishes were delicious!! My buttermilk biscuit was so rich and the wild mushroom and truffle cream flavors blended wonderfully! This was my first time trying shrimp and  grits and I was very impressed! Overall we had a great time, service was good and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Mother's Day Brunch was my first visit to this little secret.  Off the beaten Tryon path, the GPS took us to their mailing address at 127 Tryon & Trade.  5Church means 5th & Church!  It's right on that corner.  I fell in love with the look & feel of the place.  Great bar with a ton of wine selections.  A combo of leather seating & thrifty looking painted wood tables in the waiting area.  (No wait.)  I have to agree with other reviews that this is the best Lamb Burger for many, many miles around.  In fact, my daughter ordered it and we all ended up eating off her plate.  Crab cakes & poached egg was well prepared & tasty but more like a small plate size.  The belgian waffles also were very tasty but came to the table a bit cold.  Though the place was full it wasn't overcrowded so the service seemed a bit slow.  I will return to take a seat at the bar (my favorite place to sit) & try lunch and/or dinner selections.  But it will be very hard to order something other than that Lamb Burger!"}
{"text":"I'm part of the group that dined with Fei W. but wanted to share my experience as well.   So I'm a casual resident of Charlotte, NC due to my husband living out there for his work, and a couple of my friends came down to visit for the weekend. 5church is really close to his apartment, so we stopped there for drinks and appetizerss to start our night.   Like Fei mentioned, the restaurant wasn't technically open for another 5 minutes, and I made some stupid joke about how we're willing to help ourselves to the back of the bar if we needed to. Maybe that set them off, but it was pretty clear I was kidding. Anyway, they said no tables were available, but we can sit at the bar. I checked on opentable because I could not believe all 5pm reservations would be taken (Where are these people with the reservations? Are they all late? It was already 4:55pm... Where's the mad rush of people trying to get in for their reserved table?) and lo and behold, a 5:30pm reservation was available. I went back to the hostess station and told her that we actually have a table now, and wanted to let her know that we are happy to hang out at the bar until the table is ready. She barely looked at me while I was talking to her, played with her touch screen reservation system and said, rather coldly, \"Are you ready now to be seated?\" I told her yes, and she took us upstairs.  Ok that struck me as kinda odd. Why were were all the way upstairs, when the main room was totally empty? Are we not worthy to be seen through the windows by the passerby?   I will say, though, that our server was excellent and the food we ordered was amazing. We ordered hummus, quinoa tabbouleh, beet slider, foie gras ravioli, fries, and i think the chickpea salad, as well as an array of cocktails, wine, and beer. We were very happy with the food and drinks and with our server, which is why this review gets 3 stars.   When we left, I went up to the hostess table and asked what was the issue with the reservation. By then, I believe the owner was there (Patrick Whalen), and he informed me that there was a glitch in opentable and they told them not to book any more tables. I can't remember if he apologized or not for the confusion, but then he made a joke about how it was actually because they didn't really want us there. I laughed (but didn't think it was funny...retribution for my bad joke?) and said \"Yeah I could tell.\" We did tell him the food was great, but left it at that, and walked out.   Bottom line, I havent decided if I'd come here again, but the food is that good to make me even consider it. If I have another experience, I'll be sure to update my review."}
{"text":"Well, I'm visiting Charlotte with my boyfriend and ended up eating at 5Church per the interest of a friend of ours. I was hesitant, given the yelp ratings and expected an overpriced experience with mediocre food, but I was thrilled to be proven wrong!  We made a reservation Saturday afternoon for a Saturday evening table for 4, and got a table at a decent time with no problem.  Sure, the place is trendy, the downstairs area was popping. That's not really my thing. I like to eat, not party. But hey! That didn't take away from the deliciousness of the food.   We started with the pork belly spring rolls and gnocchi. Holy hell. They were FANTASTIC. The spring rolls come with 2 per order. So, we had to get two orders.  The boys both ordered the short ribs with shallot jus and mashed potatoes. My friend and I ordered the scallops on creamy polenta. The dish came with 4 large pieces of scallops. And was definitely filling compared to most scallop dishes, but... Me being me... I eat surprisingly more than most 95lbs females. I cleaned my plate up and ordered an additional pork belly spring roll app to fill me up! The other girl seemed filled with her scallop dish. The polenta was creamy and rich, the perfect complement to the light, fresh seared scallops. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.   I tried my boyfriend's braised short ribs, jus, and mashed potatoes... And if I wasn't so perfectly satisfied with my scallops, I would have had major food envy.   I cook short ribs a LOT. In fact, because I obsess over it in the kitchen, I can appreciate a well made braised short rib. Tender, fatty and falling apart. The shallot jus adding even more delicate juice and flavor. And the silky mashed potatoes just soaking it all up. Sigh. I might have to go back just to have my own plate of it.   Then came dessert. At this point, I'd eaten more than anyone at the table. But the lemon creme brûlée tart (if I recall correctly)... Our waitress lit up when I asked about it. And it was fantastic!! Not overly tart to where you're puckering up. Not overly sweet to overcompensate for the tartness. Perfect texture and complimentary crust. My boyfriend who despises lemon treats absolutely loved it.   And the s'mores dessert. Which I wasn't expecting to be as delicious as it was also had me eating past my limit even AFTER the lemon tart.   Fantastic service from our waitress who was kind, honest and attentive.   Fantastic experience all in all. And possibly my favorite meal in Charlotte yet!"}
{"text":"had my first meal here last night.  owners did a great job with the up fit as the inside has a sleek trendy feel- very modern but comfortable decor.  started out with some kind of muddled lychee drink which was AMAZING! can't remember all that was in it but i know it had lychee, vanilla vodka and ginger ale- very refreshing and easy to drink.  i had more than one... our table shared several of the \"snacks\" which were all very good with exception to the st louis mushroom ravioli which was just ok. the chickpea salad was very good as was the black bean dip and pork belly. Now on to my entree.  I had the \"60 second\" strip steak which was amazing.  The steak sauce it comes sitting on was very good although they should warn (write it on the menu) someone getting a steak  or chop of this sauce.  I happen to love steak sauce but I know many people who don't.  The pork chop entree came with the same sauce so there is a theme.  btw,  i was told the pork chop was very good. Overall, the food was very well executed.  Service was average but adequate.   I will go back."}
{"text":"This was our Christmas dinner. We found a piece of black rubber in the coke. The waiter brought another cup after we told him. The weird thing was the manager walked by later like nothing happened. He did not apologize nor acknowledge it. The restaurant charged us full price for the coke. Their food was good, but the staff's attitude made us concerned that they do not take hygiene problem very serious. Serving a drink with a rubber in it should be the least thing we expect from an expensive restaurant like this. I don't think we will come back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far one of the most delicious restaurants of Charlotte. My boyfriend and I go here every time we celebrate something and there is a reason for that because going to this restaurant is an absolute treat. I've gotten the crispy tofu (which was divine) and the flank steak before and my boyfriend just recently got the brined chicken which you literally didn't even need a knife to cut with.   Not only is their good delicious but their staff has always been very generous and have seemed to care about their customers.  My boyfriend and I love coming back here because of a brilliant food, attentive wait staff and chic ambiance."}
{"text":"I went to 5Church on Saturday night with 4 others for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. The restaurant is gorgeous and swanky and fabulous, filling a spot otherwise unfilled in Charlotte. It was very crowded and only got more so as the night went on (we left at 11 when it seemed to be turning into a real bar!). Caution, ladies - the floor is VERY slippery, as in, I almost slipped in my heels a few times, so hold on to the railing (or the nearest man) and make your way to your table!  The food: Ok. I had very, very high expectations. I was blown away by the pork belly and spicy cabbage - just perfect. We also tried the quinoa tabouleh, as recommended by our server, and the lobster mac n cheese. Both of these were fine, but nothing special. I had the Coco Loco duck mole, one of the chef's signature dishes, and it was...alright. Very, very rich but not spectacular. My boyfriend got the 60-second steak and loved it and another friend had the scallops and raved about them. Our waiter brought a s'mores dessert that was really good.  Overall, I would come back but I have to be honest that it was a little bit disappointing. Still very good though!"}
{"text":"I went to 5Church for restaurant week with a group of people. I loved everything about the restaurant. The ambiance was great, my waitress was very attentive, and the food was amazing. I order the Szechuan Pork Belly, the J-1 steak and potatoes, and the rootbeer float. I also had some food that my friends ordered. I enjoyed the hummus, but I would have to say that my favorite item that night was the lamb burger and fries. The ketchup had an indian flavor to it and it was perfect for the fries.   The food took awhile to come out, but everything is homemade and fresh, so I didn't mind the wait. I am definitely going back and I have recommend this restaurant to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Soooooo much better this time. Grease traps were clean and not stinking. The app special fig was incredible, the gnocchi app was very good as well. The apps. Were very good tonight and the atmosphere  was awesome."}
{"text":"Love Love LOVE this place.  5Church has been on my list of Charlotte restaurants to try pretty much ever since I moved here.  It wasn't until I walked in the door that I realized \"OMG, I totally came here on a date and had the most amazing rosemary cocktail at the bar.\"  I'll be honest, I don't remember who I was with, but I sure do remember the cocktail!  So this was my chance to try the food.  I came for restaurant week, which is always a bit of a gamble.  I started out with the deviled eggs.  Not usually a huge fan, but these were by far the best deviled eggs I've ever had (sorry every Southern grandma out there with their \"amazing deviled egg recipe).  Super smooth and flavorful and not gritty like you can get sometimes with egg yolks.  Then they came out with this awesome white bean hummus.  Yeah, we had two...don't judge.  Middle of the meal was an 8oz filet that was completely worth every bit of the $8 upcharge.  Meat was cooked perfectly and the sides were great.  Finishing off with desert, we tried the pretzel bar (it was pretty good) and the S'mores (BIG WINNER!!! I'm still dreaming about the brownies that came in this dessert).  Atmosphere is super modern.  Cocktails are fantastic (I tried the Rosemary Gin Fizz and the Viper).  Perfect for a date or business dinner where you want to impress, and you get a bit of that \"Uptown scene\", too.  Overall, I absolutely and highly recommend this place.  I'm glad I came back, because this time, my date and dining experience were both memorable."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here and the service has always been superb. The most impressive thing about 5Church is that they aim to delight.  They handle situations the way they should be handled and make sure the customer leaves happy.  Fantastic service is hard to find these days.  They turned me from a fan into a raving fan in March, when we were there for my mom's birthday.  They went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect and treated her like a queen.  I was beyond impressed.  And then there's the food.  Oh, the food!  Chef Jamie is \"da bomb.\"  First time for brunch?  Get the Lamb Burger.  Celebration dinner with your honey? Get the Prime \"60 Second\" NY Strip Steak.  The preparation of it will delight you.  For appetizer, get the mussels.  The sauce will rock your world.  Wash down your dinner with the Viper.  It's like a margarita, but with cucumber water, and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Visited 5Church for my friends Birthday Celebration and it did not disappoint! The decor is very different but yet very appropriate. My girls and I had reservations on a Saturday night and it was pretty packed! Many people hung out around the bar while others ate dinner. The drinks were very good, my favorites were the wild berry mojito and the viper. The viper however is strong. My friend ordered the cauliflower soup and boy oh boy was that soooo good! I had the the chick pea salad which was just \"eh\" I also had the hanger steak with mash potatoes! The steak was cooked perfectly and was flavored very well, while the mashed potatoes taste like they came from a box. The other ladies enjoyed the Herb brined roasted chicken and of course I sampled that as well! The chicken was so tender and juicy and flavored well with the natural jus on top! I must say this place does not disappoint! Perfect for date nite or girls night on the town! I hear they have an awesome brunch, will be back to try!"}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week. Our server Kevin was awesome. The wine pairing was a perfect match for the three course meal and my boyfriend and I enjoyed every second of the meal!  Black bean hummus and the pork belly appetizers were lovely.  Hangar steak was flavorful and tender. Salmon crusted with wasabi was perfectly cooked and delicious. The dessert was phenomenal - s'mores and chocolate cake.   A must try!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now and wanted to make sure the second experience was as consistently average as the first before I wrote my review. Sorry to say, second time was no better.  I will hand it to them, the ambiance is very cool, in a hip \"scene\" kind of way which I don't mind on some occasions. Kind of a cross between something you would expect to find in the SoHo art district and a Vegas hotel.  Unfortunately, that's about the best I have to say... so much potential, it's almost there, c'mon CLT you can do it.  Okay, food is average all around. I think everyone lets the ambiance cloud their impression of the food quality because CLT is just desperate for a hot new place, but if you were just served the food, it would be just average. The lamb burger was the best dish and everything else was just ehh... pork belly app was over cooked and chewy and other dishes were nothing to write home about. It sounds good on the menu, but each dish (aside from the lamb burger) had something off... either one ingredient was off, it wasn't cooked properly, etc.    My next problem... you would think a restaurant that put so much attention and detail into the interior would at very least give 2 seconds of thought to the wine list, but no... I am a foodie and wino and believe the best dining experiences are created when the food and wine are in harmony - wine can make or break the experience, and it is so sad to say that this place has about the worst wine list I've seen... just makes no sense, doesn't go with the food and just seems out of place, like someone wearing a hoodie over a suit.  Here's what they should do... first, design the menu, then carefully select wines that go with the dishes. It's not that hard people. Pick the right wines, train your staff on what wines to recommend with what dishes, and then people will say your food tastes better - the best dish paired with a bad wine can make the dish taste awful, but an average dish paired correctly can make it taste better.  It's like the sauce... without it something is missing.  Apologies for my rant, but I find it difficult to understand how this place can get so much hype when there is so much lacking."}
{"text":"It doesn't have a 5 in its name for nothing. This place definitely deserves 5 stars for my experience. My wife and I met some friends Saturday night for dinner. We had excellent service from our server kaelee. I definitely recommend the New York strip you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Over rated. That is all.   I said over rated. Stop reading this and find another restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing scallops!! And their lobster mac and cheese has frash chunks of lobster! Great date night atmosphere!  Richard the bartender took great care of us despite the fact that they were slammed."}
{"text":"The setting is stylish - but feels like they are trying too hard.  Everything is a little predictable.  That said, the lunch menu is not predictable and looked promising.  Unfortunately, everything was a little heavy and a little greasy.  There is a lot of potential, but lacking in delivery and certainly not worth the cost."}
{"text":"I went to 5Church on October 31, 2012 at the recommendation of the bartender at Black Finn. I, and my group totaling 8 people, were excited about going. The atmosphere was eclectic,upscale, modern and vibrant. We were a large party and were seated in a separate off the main area. We were treated warmly by the person who seated us. The restaurant was not very crowded but the service was very slow. The initial wait person apologized for wait and took our initial drink order. When our assigned waitress, Alison, came she seemed a little stressed and asked if we needed more time to look over the menu. We had already been waiting quite a while and were more than ready to place our orders. We ordered cocktails from their specialty cocktail menu and they were all terrible! We tried to explain to Alison what our issue was but she seemed not to understand and wanted to charge my wife an extra shot of tequila instead of just remaking the cocktail which would have been the appropriate thing to do. Alison became argumentative with my wife which was very unprofessional. Naturally, this interaction ruined the mood for the entire evening. The drink was eventually remade to my wife's specifications but the evening was already ruined at that point. The food finally arrived and was just \"okay\". I had the wasabi crusted salmon which had way too much wasabi crust and a small portion of salmon. My wife had smoked, roasted chicken which she enjoyed. My guest all enjoyed their meals. Overall, our evening way ruined by Alison's bad attitude. I would still give 5Church another try the next time we visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"Flawless presentation !! Enjoyed my meal of Hangar steak , crushed potatoes and spicy grilled broccoli for main entree . For starters did the grilled octopus and jerk chicken wraps . Nothing disappointed at all!! Atmosphere is grown and sexy dimly lit with great background music and crowd noise. The gin fizz with liquid egg whites was ordered by my date whom thoroughly enjoyed it. Tried out 2 wines before deciding on my final choice of Row 11 a Pinot Noir . The waitress Brittany was very accommodating and attentive to my parties needs . I would strongly recommend and plan on coming back ."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and want to really like and support 5 Church but, since my initial visit and review, I have made three unfulfilling visits back.  I travel around the country for a living and dine out about five times a week.  When I saw a recent listing, ranking 5 Church as a Top Ten spot in the U.S. for dining solo, I decided to try it again on a weekend where my fiancé was out of town.  Congrats to them for that ranking - quite impressive and I'm sure it will drive new business to the restaurant!  I walked in to a crowded, vibrant atmosphere, found a spot at the bar, and waited...my hope was to enjoy a few drinks and a nice meal but, after five minutes of not being acknowledged by anyone, I left.   Good food will get frequent diners like me to a restaurant and back again perhaps once or twice but, with so many choices in Uptown and the surrounding area, attentiveness and a welcoming atmosphere is where I want to spend my money."}
{"text":"Wow, the food, fantastic, the decor, fantastic, the service fantastic.    Took my girlfriend here for her birthday last night and I was excited to see the new place.  This location has struggled with different owners and companies in and out.  I don't think that will be a problem from now on.    I had the Coco Loco Duck Mole and it was the best duck I've ever tasted.  Duck can sometimes be a bit over done but not this time.  Perfectly cooked!  We started the dinner off with the shrimp flat bread appetizer and even though I didn't think it was taking long to come out from the kitchen, apparently the chef did and brought out a complimentary plate of black bean hummus for us.  Nice touch if I do say so!  The decor, like others have commented is super trendy, sexy and cool.  I asked what all the writing on the ceiling was and was told it was the entire book Art of War.  Amazing.  The padded leather sofas are ultra comfy and I could see myself coming here just to hang and have a drink.    Speaking of drinks, they have a fantastic bar area too and the drink selection seems decent.  One final note, my girlfriend checked in to Four Square and mentioned it was her birthday.  I guess the hostess saw that and they brought out a special dessert for her.  Now THAT is service!"}
{"text":"I have been hesitant to try this restaurant because of the mixed reviews in both Charlotte and Charleston (hometown). WOW was my group impressed with this restaurant. We decided to go during Queens Feast (restaurant week) because you cannot beat that deal! The food was delicious, the server was great! He was always around to fill our glass, never felt rushed, and when we had questions, he had answers.   The quality of the food was top notch, the preparation was impressive, and the presentation was beautiful. My fiancé tried the craft cocktails (2 of them) and he loved the viper but didn't like the 2nd with Hendricks.   We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there with a friend. We sat at the bar and had great service, and the food was also very good. This was all a happy surprise, as I had a much less satisfactory experience at the Atlanta location. Try the lamb shank!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great atmosphere but the service is phenomenal!!! They went above and beyond. We had the steak w/ lobster and crab. Meatball apps were good but the ahi tuna app was very delicious. Not only did the manager come out to make sure our experience was nothing short of wonderful but they invited us to the kitchen to meet the top chef!!! Kudos to 5 church!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Love the decor and ambiance. It's a very trendy spot and typically stays busy. The service isn't always the best but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Went into this restuarant with high hopes.  I've passed by it walking on 5th a few times and it always looks elegant and busy, so when my company offered to treat our whole office to dinner on them, I suggested 5Church.  Mandi Bane, the sales director, assisted me with coordinating it and was absolutely wonderful.  I must've sent her a dozen emails with changes and updates on our party and reservation.  We were going to be a party of 11 on a Thursday evening at 8:15 PM.  Kudos to 5Church for accepting my company's strange request of paying via check, too!  You made life so much easier on an accounting level!    We arrived feeling like rock stars and were treated as such.  We had our own area of the upstairs and each couple had their own individual table in a U-shaped which was so unique.  Brandon, our server, had all the instructions about our party and payment and he was incredible.  Attentive, knowledgeable, patient...honestly, best service EVER.    We started with drinks and one of my guests ordered 2 bottles of bubbly.  Brandon poured our glasses, we toasted, and then....warm champagne hit my palate.  Something was said and one of the managers (I'm assuming) hurriedly came out with another bottle that was slightly more chilled.  Very classy.    I ordered a beverage called the Viper, a trendy concotion of cucumber and tequila with a surprising kick of pepper.  It was unique.    Soooo....why only 3 stars?  Well, because frankly the food was terrible.  We had heard about the 60-second strip steak and ordered it medium rare which we knew would come out close to moo-ing.  We didn't know it would be served almost raw and cold.  I was expecting it to be seared on the outside (so hot) and cool on the inside.  It was served on top of mashed potatoes-also cold.  And the sauce tasted like a jazzed up version of A-1.  (My apologies to the chef, but it has to be said).  Of the four people in our party that ordered 2 sent it back and requested it be taken off the bill.  Me and my boyfriend choked it down, but was displeased with the entree after having such high hopes.    I will say that I will probaly go back for drinks and an appetizer.  We did share the meat tray and that was lovely.  I told Brandon that the proscitto was the best I had ever had. As for service and atmosphere, 5Church really shined, but the entree of the hyped up steak was a major letdown."}
{"text":"Took advantage of Charlotte restaurant week and had dinner here tonight. What a great meal! I had the cauliflower  soup to start, and it was great. Wish I had a huge bowl of it. Then I had the grilled hangar steak, which was an amazing piece of meat. The taste was absolutely fantastic in my opinion. Dessert was a butter cake which was ok, but I'm not a sweets guy, so it was sort of a throw in for me.   My wife had the roasted beet and fennel salad, which she thought was great. I had a few bites and the greens were great! Made me miss summer. Her entrée was the seared scallops which she enjoyed very much.    We would love to eat here a few night a week, but it is expensive. And for someone who cooks and know how much food is, I just can't justify spending that much on food. 5church is a very good restaurant.    We also promised our waitress we would mention her. Thank you AMBER for the great service."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight and it was awesome. Really cool setting with a pretty diverse crowd. Ryan S. was our server and he was fantastic. Very knowledgeable, made great recommendations and was very attentive without being overbearing. My boyfriend and I were very, very happy with all of our food choices-most of them being server recommendations. Craft cocktails were definitely worth the trip as well! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I dinned at 5Church on 2/5/15.   Setting: Beautiful restaurant! Everything was very modern, dark and sexy. From the moment I walked in I felt like I wasn't in Charlotte, NC but actually in NYC.   Food: I came with two colleagues, promptly seated around 7pm. Our waiter was absolutely excellent and very attentive. He was knowledgeable about food and gave great recommendations. Started off with various wines as we cruised through the menu. We all ordered the petite filet (med/rare, medium and med/well) mashed yukon and a side of green beans. The food was excellent, but all of our steaks came out practically rare. We didn't send it back though since we were exhausted. I tried the blue cheese steak topping. YUM! It went all over my mashed yukon and green means. We finished off dinner with the chai doughnuts and sorbet. If you like anything chai, please try them!!!!  Overall: I'll be back in Charlotte in May. I will most likely be visiting 5Church again!"}
{"text":"Went for a work dinner after glowing recommendations from colleagues. We shared the ceviche and the poke which were great, but oh man the A5 Wagyu really changed my life. Had some solid cocktails but nothing too memorable as well."}
{"text":"Just visiting and the hotel recommended this wonderful restaurant. Loved the steak. My friend had the lamb burger. So good. Service was prompt and professional. Wine menu good selection. Thanks for not adding the same ol' regulars."}
{"text":"Not a good value for money, the restaurant is way overpriced for the quality of food provided."}
{"text":"Horrible service and food. 3 hour wait, after which they informed us them at they got the names mixed up and sat the wrong table. The food was not any better."}
{"text":"While I understand busy times for Queen's Feast however being packed like sardines in a high volume area of the restaurant(service bar at the bottom of the stairs) was horrible. I think we were bumped by every server walking by and every guest wanting a spot at the bar. The dollar speaks and when the atmosphere is horrible the dining experience is horrible. Food was so so."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and may have just ordered the wrong thing. I ordered the flank steak and it was not good. I usually finish my plate and I ate everything but the main protein. Not normal. It's overpriced for the quality I received. I will go back because everyone has a bad day, but if the second time isn't good, there will be another post with 1 star."}
{"text":"Great spot in uptown Charlotte...walkable from anywhere in the city. Really cool, upscale atmosphere inside with white leather and chandeliers for decor. Ordered the filet medium - it was delicious and crispy on top. Had two of \"the ivey\" cocktails and they were delicious if you like a sweet, fruity drink. Boyfriend got the tuna medium rare and it was great as usual - coated in a wasabi crust. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer--This review is clearly biased because my fiance proposed to me here (I accepted!).  Also, we visited first week of May, so this review is several weeks overdue.  I've been hearing about Charlotte's burgeoning local food scene for a while, so when I had the opportunity to visit the city, i was super excited to try out a few restaurants.  Thanks to Yelp!, I decided on 5Church for dinner on one of the nights.    We started off with a bottle of malbec, the truffled mushroom pierogies, and the romaine wedge.  The malbec, Twigs Reserva, was a recommendation from our server, Brandon.  It was a good showcase of what an excellent malbec can be--luscious, full of flavor, but still delicate and silky.  As for the appetizers, both were stellar.  I would definitely order the pierogies again.  What's not to love about delicious, pillowy dough and savory mushrooms?  Also, the peperoncini in the wedge salad (are they housemade?) were surprisingly tart and delightful.  I love well-prepared little flourishes.    For the main course we split the seared sea scallops (slightly different preparation than the one on the menu right now) and mac and cheese.  I am a huge scallop snob and 5Church's won me over right away because they were excellently seared.  However, the mac and cheese (no longer on the menu) was a disappointment.  Though it looked deliciously creamy with a nice crunchy topping of (panko?) breadcrumbs, the first bite was oily with a curiously metallic after taste.  As soon as we told Brandon, he whisked it off and took it off our check--what great service!  He also asked us exactly why we didn't like it so he could tell the chef.  We ended the meal with a decadent chocolate trifle with marshmallow sauce.  Very sweet and rich but so unique!  And the portion was large enough to take some back to the hotel for a late-night snack.  Around the same time, my fiance proposed and I have to mention how wonderful the staff was.  Not only did Brandon bring out a bottle of prosecco for us to enjoy, the manager came by to congratulate us.  Thanks 5Church, for not only a memorable meal but also exemplary service.  We will be sure to visit the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Parking here is a little tough but tolerable. Went here for brunch. Tried the waffle and the omelette, both were very good. Also had the chicken salad sandwich which was also tasty. Service was quick and accurate. Will return and try dinner."}
{"text":"I have been to 5Church a handful of times.  The service is great and the decor is nice.  The first time I went, we sat upstairs in the mezzanine which is a great place to sit for large parties.  Three things on their menu that I have had and I recommend are the pork belly, scallops, Brussell sprouts, and for brunch the crab cakes!  I have also tried whatever people ordered that I was with and everything is pretty good!"}
{"text":"I've had brunch here twice.  It was really good, and a little crowded, but it is a popular brunch spot.  The food is here is nice, and a little traditional with a modern flare.  I did think the portion sizes were quite small for the price and quality.  I've also had a better mimosa.  I didn't get to try the sangria because I waited too long, so apparently it is good!  For a nice brunch, I think I would prefer their sister restaurant Nan & Byron's.  I also considered having my rehearsal dinner here.  For the price it was a really good deal for a chic location and good food, depending on your budget of course.  The space is unique, and beautiful with lot's of acrylic fixtures, with an earthy modern feel.  I would come back, maybe during Queens Feast to try their dinner options."}
{"text":"Geez, I haven't written a review in almost a year.  How bad do I suck?    I had pretty high hopes for this place.  Someone whose judgement I (used to) trust recommended it very highly.  I figured it would be at least OK, and in that I was not disappointed.    5Church would like so badly to be so very hip.  The ambiance from the moment you hit the door is a combination of black, mismatched wall decorations, and flop-sweat.  You can feel the vibe shouting at you, \"YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO DINE HERE!  YOU ARE SO VERY COOL!!!!!!\".  Alas, I am not.  I'm old, cranky, and get pretty annoyed when the food doesn't live up to the hype, so in retrospect the interior didn't work for me.  I will say I received exemplary service.  We ate pretty early (old, remember?), so she wasn't busy, but I really did appreciate her skill at being ingratiating, warm, and efficient.    We started with a shrimp and cheese flatbread.  I guess maybe my sights were set a bit too high, but it was......fine.  Nothing special, or that I can't get elsewhere.  I had the 60 second strip for entree.  The steak itself was acceptable, but again nothing that would make this a destination restaurant.   However, the roasted potatoes it came with wrecked this dish.  Roasted potatoes should be golden, crisp on the outside, fluffy and redolent of time in the oven inside.  I'm reasonably sure the ones I got saw a caramelizing torch for a minute or so.  Bonus points would have been awarded had anyone noticed I ate 1.5 of them and pushed the rest to the side.  Alas, none were given.  The cordial mixed drink I had for afters was a pretty generous pour, and the bartender made sure to come check that he had made it right since it was not a common drink.  Overall I left somewhat disappointed in the food.  The vibe is trying hard, the staff certainly seems invested in creating a good experience, but the food just isn't there for this to be a destination restaurant.  Additionally, I left a comment for the owners through Open Table, and their response seems to have been to add me to their mailing list.  Um, guys?  I don't need more spam."}
{"text":"Just like several of the other reviewers here, my GF and I decided to try this place for dinner last night for the first time (Queen's Feast).  First the positive 1. Good location - 2 blocks from center of uptown.  Basically across the street from my office 2. Nice atmosphere - Some reviews here on Yelp complain about the darkness.  I will have to say that one of the things this place succeeds at is LOOKING like a nice restaurant. 3. Our dinner server was friendly and attentive 4. GF's cauliflower soup was good  The negative... 1. hostess had zero suggestions  on parking - Valet parking begins at 6 pm (standard for restaurants on this block), so when I asked the hostess where my GF could park if she arrived before 6, the hostess had zero suggestions.  Isn't this something that they should train their employees on?  2. Warm beer (known issue) - I planned to arrive ahead of my reservation so that I could scope out parking for my GF and enjoy a cold one at the bar.  My draft IPA was warm.  I assumed that it was simply a new keg, so I asked the bartender to replace it with a different IPA.  He informed me that it was a known problem with all of their beers even though the temp gauge in their keg closet reads 38.  This most likely means that they have not adequately insulated their lines running to the taps.  Again, this place only succeeds in LOOKING like a nice restaurant.  First the bartender offered to give me chilled glass only to discover that they were out of chilled glasses.  I had him replace it with a Porter (more palatable at warmer temperatures).  I asked the guy sitting next to me at the bar if his beer was warm.  His response was \"the beer is always warm here, that's why I ordered a Guinness\".  3. Dinner seating was a joke - another reviewer already hit on this.  We were seated at a table in the bar are (we had reservations mind you), right in the middle of traffic, at bottom of stairs, across from restrooms.  4. Choice of water (another joke) - when at Morton's or Hyde Park, you expect to be presented with the fancy water choices.  However, a restaurant you needs to earn your way into that category.  All this accomplished was making me look cheap in front of my GF (which she already knows that I am).  5. Pork Belly Spring Rolls (jokes keep getting funnier) - they tasted as though they were right out of the frozen food isle and, I kid you not, the size of your pinky finger.  I can only assume that it was because they had shriveled under a heat lamp since the garnishment sauce was burnt to the plate like chewing gum.  6. Worst $38 filet if ever had - not trusting the quality of the Hanger Steak, I upgraded to the Filet.  And knowing full well at this point that they would over-cook my steak, I ordered it RARE in hopes that I would receive something resembling med-rare.  Sure enough, the steak arrived somewhere between Medium and Med-Rare.  And not a great cut.  Definitely grocery store quality.  PS.  I noticed some of the reviews suggesting that this is a good lunch spot.  I could actually see that as being the case.  However, NO plans to return for dinner or after-work drink."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place from everyone in Charlotte, so we had to go! They have this AMAZING drink called the Bourberry which I could have had 5 of and I'm not even a bourbon drinker! Only HUGE drawback: drink is $11 a pop and doesn't even use any kind of super-premium booze, not cool. We waited about 20 minutes past what we were quoted for a table but the service was great and so was the food which I have to say was much more reasonably priced than the drinks. The decor is super fun; all black and white with damask-print wall coverings and clear plastic molded chairs. I'd go back but would really urge them to re-think their drink prices in comparison to food; great drinks will sell themselves, you don't have to jazz them up with crazy prices!"}
{"text":"Awesome servers.  Awesome desserts. Basil Hayden rocks. Did not get a chance to try the food but will be back to try it again. Parks big is a bit tough as it is in Any part of uptown. Having said that, they offer free valet if you can trust another person driving your car."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here. Started with the greens salad, the dressing was delicious. Wasabi salmon cooked medium for the main course and I loved it. I'd order it again. Cool atmosphere and staff was great!"}
{"text":"I guess I will be the voice of dissension in the following review, but to be honest my experience this evening wasn't anything to write home about.  Frankly it was quite forgettable.  To set the stage, it's Restaurant Week winter 2013 and I've heard some good things about 5Church and as part of the purpose of this event, this was a great opportunity to try a new place without breaking the bank.  I went ahead and made reservations for 6:00.  I got the impression that our babysitters were going to be a bit late and I called 5Church around 12:30pm and asked to move out our reservation time by about 30 minutes.  I couldn't hear the Hostess on the other end and she couldn't hear me because of the ridiculously loud blaring music behind her.  I got the \"lazy\" answer of that they were packed to the gills and there was no room for me to push out the time.  Fine, it worked out and we got there 5 minutes prior to 6:00.  When we got there the 3 hostesses were pretty snotty and couldn't be bothered and asked us to wait at the bar which was fine, but I walked past a nearly empty dining room to get the the bar.  I never get the whole overstaffing of hosts / hostesses thing.  Also, these people are the first impression you get when you walk in and to have them not be welcoming and efficient is a bad start to the experience.    At 6:20 we finally got seated only when I went and bothered the ladies at the hostess stand again, saying we were ready to be seated.  We walked upstairs and we were seated right next to the kitchen (Awesome right?).  They had these slim swinging doors which were constantly being kicked open and swinging loudly revealing the mishmosh of the kitchen.  It wasn't going to work for me and I asked to be reseated.  We were sat on the other side of the upstairs bar right under a speaker blaring music and I realized this was where the hostess that I spoke to earlier must have been standing when she took my call because I couldn't hear myself think let alone carry on my usual pleasant conversation with Sweetie.  Great, I should have packed my earplugs.  OK, onto the food.  I decided to forego the Restaurant Week Menu and ordered the Crispy Pork Belly and 60 Second NY Strip and Lobster Mac & Cheese.  The crispy pork belly app was tasty, I must say.  Crispy and well plated, it made for a nice culmination of flavors and it made things started turn around for me.  If I couldn't hear Sweetie because of the music at least I can enjoy the food.  The 60 second steak is awesome.  It is made in a cast iron skillet and never flipped but cooked through so that one side is cooked more but the other side is perfectly rare and cooked to temperature.  It was plated with a nice signature sauce by their chef which was both tangy and smokey....nicely done, it was the perfect compliment to the steak.  The lobster mac and cheese was disappointing and was just a saucer of mac and cheese completely void of lobster.  For $9.00 I expected more and it was a bit insulting to not have any more than a morsel of lobster.  I suggest they take a short walk to the Capital Grille to learn how that dish should be prepared. Sweetie had the wasabi encrusted salmon, which was bland and forgettable.  She expected to taste wasabi and got nothing.  Not much else to say.    Service was half and half, the waitress popped in at the right times for the most part but after dropping off the dessert menu we didn't see her for 20 minutes which was annoying since we were ready to go.  Sweetie went to the restroom came back reporting that there wasn't any soap in the dispenser which always makes you wonder how the servers are able to wash their hands.  All in all, my food was OK nothing spectacular and I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check out this place for awhile with all of the great press.   But I have to say for me it didn't live up to the hype.  We started with the Pork Belly Spring Rolls and just didn't have much flavor.  We got the Chicken and mashed potatoes, which had a good taste.  I got the Tuna and it also was good but the potatoes were not cooked enough I thought.    For me it didn't live up to the hype and was just ok, was hoping it would blow me away."}
{"text":"So here is my honest appraisal of 5church(10/03/17).  Loved the ambiance as I walked in the door - hostesses were very sweet and friendly.  Sitting at the bar (2/3rds full of patrons) I was quickly approached by a bartender who asked \"something to drink?\" And left a drink menu.  I shared that I would be having dinner as well and she returned with a dinner menu - not small talk or desire to connect with me.  I placed an order for a Willamette Valley Pinot Noir and was told they were out, taking her recommendation on an a similar wine.  As she served the wine, the bar surface in front of me showed no fewer than 5 drink rings, from prior patrons - my bartender too busy to clean between or care about her customers experience.    Dinner ordered - this would be the last time I would speak with my server for the night - no check in on food, no Thank You with the check drop off.    My salad now in front of me(Beet and Winter vegetable) - excellent preparation and flavor.  Only personal change would be the Boursin cheese to something stronger, but otherwise excellent.  My water glass was refilled consistently, and without comment or acknowledgement.  Dinner came and the scallops were clean, prepared perfectly and the flavors and texture on the plate complimented the scallops very well.  Challenge - they were warm but not hot.  They had been sitting/resting longer than I would have liked, and it took away from the pleasure of the meal.    Overall - this could be a 4 star with better front of the restaurant management.  Food is part of the experience, the experience is the other part.  Food had all the qualities of being excellent - but the experience was lacking.  Would I go back? Yes - but would sit at a table and have proper service."}
{"text":"Pretty slow service. Went on a Saturday around 3 but they only serve brunch all day. We were all disappointed in the selection of the menu considering it wasn't a brunch hour. Also, the lack of vegan options on the brunch menu. Food wasnt bad but wasn't amazing. Don't think I would visit for brunch but possibly give it a try for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"One of Charlotte's trendiest hotspots, 5 Church works much more effectively as a bar than as a restaurant. This was my third visit here, but my first for a sit-down meal. We were entertaining colleagues from out of town, and our party had to practically scream across the table at one another to be heard. Our waitress was sweet, but the service was ridiculously slow. I ordered the pan-seared scallops, which were just OK, and no one else seemed particularly blown away by their plates. This may be a very cool spot for drinks and appetizers after work (the wine and beer selection is outstanding), but as a fine dining choice, it leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"My daughter took me here for Mother's Day brunch buffet and it was absolutely delicious. There was succulent crab legs, the shrimp and grits was bomb and French toast was amazing. It was a little pricey but well worth it. We missed our reservation time but the wait staff was kind enough to get us in even though they were busy. I also love the ambiance. You definitely won't be disappointed... oh almost forget Mimosas we're on point"}
{"text":"As soon as Charlotte's council vote was made possible by the \"brunch bill\" pass (by the state legislature), I made my early reservation at 5Church. In another words: The so-called \"brunch bill\" allows restaurants to start selling booze at 10 a.m. on Sundays (instead of noon). So, we were there at 10 a.m in celebration of North Carolina's new Brunch Bill, because why not ;)  I was in the mood for some Southern comfort food, so I ordered the Fresh Buttermilk Biscuit. It was fluffy and served with wild mushroom and truffle cream and topped with over-hard egg. - Convenient location in Uptown. - Friendly, courteous staff. - Love the black and white decor.  Four Yelps"}
{"text":"This review is for rating my experience at the bar itself, not rating the food.  The reason for only a two star was for the fact it smelled like a bathroom, the people at the door were great, greeted us with excitement, the moment I set at bar, I could just smell this odor of toilet cleaner or a damp towel, and it did not go away for the whole time I was there. I ordered only one drink and I lost my appetite for more. I will have to give this place another go, but for now, they have some work to do, not impressed.   By the way, the one in Charleston SC was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and dessert, not a good place to eat a full meal.   The portions are very small, the prices are insane and the taste is average at best. I ordered the \"60 second\" steak and my mashed potatoes tasted like someone dropped a salt shaker in the potatoes. Also, it didn't seem like a very quality cut of meat. Definitely not worth $38.   I ordered the lamb burger the week before. The bread seemed kind of dry and the meat was completely raw. Liberty's lamb burger is much better.   If you go here, just stick with drinks. It has a good crowd and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner yesterday and was very impressed. We had a great experience and the food was extremely good. Love the new food and cocktail menu. I hope they stick with their new \"fresh menu\" approach. Our waiter Gabriel was awesome and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really good \"60 second\" steak!  Creative and tasty!  Service could come with a smile, but the food is good."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, trendy and great food too! Went here for Sunday Brunch and was very pleased with my Shrimp & Anson Grits with Sweet Tea. Nicely presented and the micro greens were a nice touch. Very nice staff. Don't expect a quite meal as it is a popular place which makes the volume quite high :-)"}
{"text":"Over priced and low quality food during today's Mother's Day brunch.  Not to mention I think the air conditioning was not working which made it hot."}
{"text":"Terrible service!  We made a reservation 3 weeks ago for 15 people at 9pm.  We waited at the downstairs bar and at 9:30pm were asked by the hostess if we wanted to sit together......wait, what? That's the whole point of a reservation! Were finally seated upstairs directly in front of the bar (where there is VERY little room and people were YELLING behind us almost the entire meal) around 9:50pm to a 3 course prix-fix menu (we knew this ahead of time). Even thought the menu was basically set, I still didn't get my entrée until 11:30pm, and it took over 20 minutes to get our checks once we had asked for them. Don't think the food was amazing enough for me to go back again."}
{"text":"Wonderful and attentive service.  Great flavors on food.  On point!!  Well done gentlemen!!!  Jason!  See?  Your name is in the review forever!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to 5Church 3 times since its opening, with a different experience each time. The first, a Yelp event so of course it was live, had me giddy with hope of a new nighttime mainstay. Atmosphere, drinks and food were all on-point, and I'm already a fan of tapas-style dining. The second time I dropped in for a quick lunch, and was served a salad so small, I actually thought it was garnish, and asked the server when the actual salad would arrive. That was awkward for both of us. This last time was Sunday brunch; decent serve-time, really good lamb burger, and bottomless sangria. The sangria was a bit watered down; I could taste the Sprite in it, and the waiter developed a bit of attitude after my fourth glass (or did I get the attitude? No, definitely him.). But overall a decent, slightly overpriced brunch. Will it be my first stop? No. But it's the right move for location and convenience, if you're downtown."}
{"text":"So got a chance to try 5Church for restirant week. Heard of all the awards so I had high hopes coming in this dinner.   Kudos they did not disappoint. The three course was awesome from start to finish. I got the Quinoa Tabbouleh, Grilled Atlantic Salmon,  and the S' mores Trifle. The quinoa was lite and refreshing.  the salmon was grilled prefectly. The asian veggie salad that accompanied it gave it that brust of flavor. Then you have the soy-jalepeno vinaigrette made the dish sing. The chef did a great job on pair theese flavors together. Last but not least the desert.  The trifle was creamy and rich. Not too sweet and the marshmallows topping was fluffy airy.   The decor is clean, unique, and electic. Staff was great a well. Water glass stayed full and the food recommendations were great.  5Church truely lives up to the awards they have received.  You not be disappointed.   Feliz Comiendo"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the food was awesome. Restaurant week menu was definitely not a disappointment. I had the hanger steak, bib salad and chocolate torte. Everything was delicious - they do cook their meat a bit on the rarer side but it didn't bother me. The only part that was a negative was the dessert - the chocolate torte was too rich but none of the other restaurant week options jumped out to me. Overall, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great location...trendy atmosphere but that's about all 5Church offers. 5Church really isn't a \"foodie\" place...unless your idea of a great meal is poor service and a mediocre (at best) entrée. Then by all means...you have found the right spot!  I went there for my birthday last weekend. We had reservations for 7:30PM. We got our food around 10:15 after complaining to management.    While the restaurant offers the uptown location and trendy atmosphere, the service is horrible and the food nor drinks are worth the money.    I stuck to wine as the cocktails seemed watered down. BUT if you are into paying $15 a drink for a watered down cocktail then go on with your bad self.  Suggestion for management. If you are going to take over 2 hours to serve burnt food at least make sure the clientele is a bit tipsy. Then perhaps I wouldn't have remembered how bad the food was...  I ordered the crab cakes as I read some positive reviews on yelp...but then again most companies I've worked for have also asked us to post positive reviews as \"customers\". The first batch was burned to crisp and mostly bread. Maybe they thought I said \"crabcakes...hold the crab?\" I've had better crabcakes from Harris Teeter. A Swanson's TV dinner would be a considerable step up from the \"crabcakes\" at 5Church.    On a positive note:  *Trendy upbeat vibe *Manager comped the balls of bread labeled as \"crabcakes\" *I was able to charge my phone  *My friends pasta was actually pretty good *It was my Birthday so I didn't have to pay....  **John Anderson approves this message**"}
{"text":"Great spot to grab dinner and a few drinks...It has a trendy and modern vibe to it (dim lighting, swanky music, funky decor). We went here during a business trip (from NYC) and did not feel that we were in Charlotte while dining here.  They have a cool looking bar and a decent selection of scotch.  Our waitress Alyssa was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about both the food and wine menu...she made several recommendations, all of which we enjoyed.  We started with the truffle mushroom pierogies and a special gnocchi app with pork shoulder...the gnocchi were very light and fluffy, and the pork shoulder had nice flavor  For dinner we had the salmon and the duck breast. The salmon was light, very tasty and good size piece of fish. The duck was a much larger portion and combo'd well with the mushrooms and potato cake.  We will definitely give this place another shot on our next trip to NC."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch. Now serving drinks at 10 am with the passage of the new Sunday liquor laws. Service was spot on and atmosphere is very trendy. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh! I am IN LOVE with their decors. Of course, people don't do reviews on restaurant bc of decors right? It's for the foods! LOL.  Well we went for lunch and it was ok, nothing speculator. Waiter recommended the lamb burgers which was good! Kind of messy to eat and sauce dripping everywhere. Funny but their fries were addictive! The flat bread shrimp 'pizza' were ok too, wouldn't say I'll ordered it again. I do like the arugula flavor on it but otherwise didn't excited me.    Still, I can't get over their decors.  It looks like they put a lot of work and thoughts in it. Definitely a nice place for a nighttime lounge, drinks and chill place."}
{"text":"Food good but not wow. Our group had mussels, Pasta bolognese and short ribs. Although all the dishes were good, the pasta Bolognese was particularly exceptional. Didn't care for the bread at all. Try George's, Brios or Toscana for good bread and butter. As others have said it's a modern, vibrant environment. It's a nice restaurant and we enjoyed the evening, but no dish was such that we said we can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my entire family! We enjoyed the atmosphere, very trendy, but the food was only okay in my opinion.   My sister in law and I both had pasta cappellinni with scallops added...the pasta was just that....pasta with some garlic, olive oil, butter, and some fresh burratta on top! The calamari appetizer was great though.  My mom had the steak and she said it was phenominal!  My dad had the swordfish, which was good, but a bit dry when I tried it.  My fiance had the sweet potato gnocchi with lamb...it was very tough for lamb which made it hard to eat. There were only a few gnocchi on the plate.   The cocktails were great and their wine list was very large as well :) Enjoyed the time with family and the experience, but will probably give somewhere else a try next time."}
{"text":"I was really excited to check this place out because I read about in an online brunch blog. Needless to say, it was overrated. The experience was sub-par. The hostess wasn't very friendly and we waited along time for food that wasn't freshly made and had obviously been sitting under a heading lamp for a while.  I would NOT recommend this place nor return. It seriously gave me a stomach ache and was a poor experience.   The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because they refilled our coffee in a very timely manner and due to the location."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying this place is very trendy. The ambiance is suitable for a romantic dinner, a girls/guys night out, or even just drinks. It's located on 5th and Church across from Basil.   I had heard many good things about this place but was really impressed with my experience. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine choices. My friend and I spilt the Wasabi Crusted Salmon and the Lamb Bolognese. Both were beyond excellent. Salmon cooked absolutely perfect. For desert the S'mores Trifle is a must try!"}
{"text":"I really love 5Church. I have been here for dinner and brunch multiple times. The dinner cost is on the pricey side, but brunch is surprisingly inexpensive! And good! I have had the French toast and burger. The mimosas and sangrias are ridiculously cheap, have a few! Sangrias are my fave, and I love that their sangria has a mulled wine taste, with a flavor or cinnamon and cardamom, yum!  This time around I have a mimosa flight - amazing! There were 4 flavors, kiwi was my fav. Others were pineapple, rose and berry(?)  All in all, I would return here again and again,  any beat the price or the quality of food. 5 stars all day from me."}
{"text":"I was invited here for a Saturday birthday celebration brunch and it wasn't a bad experience.  It was my first time dining here as it has been on my dining list for awhile.  I ordered the Shrimp and Anson Mills grits which were delicious and I had a few glasses of Sangria as well (not bad at $2.50 for a nice sized glass).  The staff were super friendly and accommodating to our party of 11 and even adjusted everyone's bill due to the extended wait time for our food to be prepared.  I look forward to bringing my hubby here to dine next time and we'll probably go for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Brunch was just ok.  The drinks were good and affordable.  All of our food was cold.  Flavors were good but the temperature really took away from overall experience. I'd give it another try though.  Hopefully it was just a bad day..."}
{"text":"The hubby and I visited 5Church with another couple during restaurant week. We were seated quickly and our waiter was quick to greet us, yet fairly mechanical with his overview of the menu. He reassured us several times throughout our meal that he wasn't trying to rush us out the door, which led to us, in fact, feeling like we were being rushed out of the door...    Our apps, main dishes, and dessert all came out at an appropriate pace. Overall we all enjoyed ourselves. I'm giving three stars for 5Church because I'm just not sure I understand the hype... the ambience is cool, the food was good, but it didn't leave me dying to come back for another meal. I'd rather spend the same amount of money (or less) exploring another chic restaurant in CLT."}
{"text":"I have dined here twice for dinner and was very impressed with the food both times.  The short ribs are very good and the drink selections are expansive.  Service has been very good both times and the menu is a little pricey, but worth it.  The decor is very trendy but all flows together."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and despite iffy reviews on Yelp we decided to try it. Well, always trust the reviews. Don't get me wrong the food was delicious, I had the lamb sirloin and my boyfriend had the scallops. We also split the Yukon smashed potatoes. All of it was good but hardly as good as the price. Mainly because a meal of this price should be partnered with great service and drinks. The drinks had very little bourbon, mostly watered down. Our server did little to make conversations and made no suggestions. Merely took our order, gave us the items and left. It's very dark, but not in a romantic way, just dark. We were also seated at a table that every car that drove by the lights struck me in the eyes. There were tons of kids in for a prom, and in walked a 21st birthday party that dominated the bar and continued to yell over each other. We left in under a hour. They don't seem to know what kind of restaurant they want to be. Ultimately, this is a missable place, go to Cellar at Duckworths, way better food and service."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was great. Food was great had the pizza. Had the bottomless mimosas and the server keep our glasses full which was great."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this was one of the worst upscale dining experiences I have had. The evening started out ok when we walked in--lovely modern decor and a fun vibe. Our table wasn't quite ready and the cocktail I ordered at the bar was delicious. Things quickly went downhill. Despite making a reservation well in advance and specifically asking to be in a quiet area, we were seated in the bar. It really seemed they had given our table away (though we were actually a few minutes early for our reservation) because I can't imagine they actually put people there regularly. The food was totally meh for the $$ and took 2 hours to come out even though we all ordered steaks. Our waitress was not very friendly though that may have been because she had to yell to communicate over the bar noise. Around 10, people in the bar were leaning up against my chair and using our table for their drinks. Absolutely absurd for the amount of money our group of 8 spent there."}
{"text":"Other restaurant week participants should take a cue from 5Church -- looking at you, Chima! Excellent service, excellent food, a relaxed/not-rushed environment. THIS is how you win fans and regular customers during restaurant week. It was our first time at 5Church but after such a great experience we'll be back for sure!  We made reservations and were shown right to our table as soon as we arrived. Service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing or rushing the experience. The waiter gave us the restaurant week menu as well as the regular menu... Smart man, as we added the hand cut fries from the regular menu.   From the restaurant week selections, I had the seafood ceviche and tuna. Both dishes were excellent -- light and fresh, high quality seafood! Dessert was the blood orange consume and the only thing I didn't totally love. I think it sat in the kitchen a little too long before it was brought to the table. The flavors were good but the gelato was melted and the meringue was a tad soggy.   I also really enjoyed my cocktail, the Viper, an awesome mix of patron, orange liquor, lime, cucumber and cayenne. Spicy! We're counting down to our next visit outside of restaurant week so we can try out other menu items.   Thanks for showing 'em how restaurant week is done, 5Church!"}
{"text":"I honestly didn't know what to think about this place when I first arrived, but the hostesses instantly put me at ease with their smiles and friendly attitudes. Our group was seated and proceeded to experience one of the best meals I've had in a while. From the exemplary service to the DEEE-licious food at the great value (bacon pizza for four A+, flat bread A+, and lamb burger A++!!) I can't complain about a single thing at 5Church and I will be back again if I am ever fortunate enough to revisit Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This place....meh. Flew into Charlotte, it got great reviews. However, a couple things immediately became apparent. One, the food was really overdressed, felt like each piece of lettuce was dipped into a vat of salad dressing. Second, the bus boys acted like they were clearing plates away at a McDonalds, I wasn't even halfway done before my appetizer was just taken from me. Third, the drinks seemed like they were made by someone's drunk uncle who had no bartending experience. I ordered an old fashioned, basically got a glass full of bourbon with an orange slice. I left wasted, so that was a plus. I will say, the steak was good and it was clear that they have good meat. This place would do a much better job if they pace the courses better and let the local ingredients shine over all the \"flash\"."}
{"text":"The 60 second steak was original and delicious.  The ceviche was a ten as well.  The burger is also pretty stellar.  The bar is a nice place to grab a drink or sit down and have dinner as well.    My favorite part of this restaurant is the wine list.  It may not be extremely deep, but what they have is great value and top notch.  I am always happy with their by the glass choices.  I would recommend having at least two hours for a full dinner service fyi."}
{"text":"Okay here's the thing, the food here is great and the service was also pretty top-notch.  I'm not sure what it is about Charlotte, but they are really good at splitting bills.  The reason that they're only getting 3 stars and an A-OK rating is for the confusing welcome we received.  6 of us walked in on a Friday at 4:55pm.  I get that it's early-bird special dinner time, but we wanted to grab some drinks and apps before starting our night.  They don't actually open until 5, but the doors were open so we just walked in.  The two hostesses who greeted us informed us that they weren't open yet, but since it was so close to 5, we just stayed hovering awkwardly by their station.    We asked for a table for 6 and they inform us that there are no tables available.  Their entire restaurant is booked, but we're welcome to sit at the bar if we really want.    Well we really wanted, which seemed to put them in a quandary since they weren't REALLY booked.  Or everyone happened to cancel their 5pm reservation.  Both are equally likely I think.  My friend went on Opentable and found a reservation for 5:30pm for 6 so she booked it and went back to the hostess.  At that point they \"found\" a table and asked if we wanted to be seated right away.  We stayed for an hour or so and had some terrific drinks and apps but the restaurant remained mostly empty.  Maybe they didn't think we'd notice?  As we walked out, the more extroverted of our group asked the hostess about the situation and a new guy tried explaining it as \"opentable told us to not accept any more reservations.\"  Interesting since that's how we booked our reservation.  Maybe they didn't want our jeans and sneakers wearing, massive DSLR camera toting kind, in their upscale place.  We'll never know for sure.  If you made it this far into the saga, congrats!  The moral of the story is, the food is good, but if you want to have some, you best be reserving upfront."}
{"text":"Sunday Funday!! I've had my eye on 5Church for a while. The food looked appetizing, and the decor impeccable!!! I felt like I was dining in New York or Miami.   After reading a few reviews I thrilled to hear Mimosas and Sangria are $2.50! Sounds like a Win Win to me!   I made reservations a few days ahead using OpenTable. I parked across the street (which cost $16!!!!) Jesus!! I should've caught an uber!   The food was magnificent! I ordered the Crab cakes & Poached Eggs which came with spinach. I also had a side of bacon. The Crab Cake portion is small, yet so delicious! Cooked to perfection might I add. I appreciated the large lump Crab meat. I had 2 mimosas with my meal. I definitely look forward to having the Sangria next time. One of my girlfriends ordered the lamb burger (something else I look forward to having)   Our waitress was warm and informative. I appreciated her suggestions. I definitely look forward to coming here again soon. Thank you 5Church"}
{"text":"Oh yum! First time here, last night before the short walk to Blumenthal Center for a show. I had the scallops and they were easily the best that I have ever had! Just right portion, great flavor and loved the succotash. Chose the broccolini as a side, watching my waistline and they were happy to do it without the Parmesan and it was delish."}
{"text":"Now THIS is what I'm talking about! Every aspect of 5Church has been meticulously thought-out and it shows: excellent, innovative cuisine, beautiful, spacious layout, very modern decor, awesome drinks. Service was professional and prompt. The 5Church-goers are sleek and sexy.  Yeah, it can get a bit expensive. But, you know what? You get what you pay for and 5Church is worth every damn penny. If you don't like brilliant, high-quality, premium beverages, there are like a billion shitty bars that serve Bud Light just down the street."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a very unique esthetic due to the hip layout and design. The bar area is very unique and is a great place to grab a drink after work. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable, to include the valet employees. BTW, valet parking is complimentary, which is fabulous for uptown Charlotte.   As far as the downside, this restaurant is extremely pricey and the portions were very small. In addition, the taste wasn't that fabulous and didn't match the price. I ordered the sea scallops, which were good, just not phenomenal. Kudos to our waiter for providing two girlfriends with free dessert since we were celebrating birthdays. Very generous!!  The restaurant is very loud and makes it hard to hear conversations from the other side of the table. At 10:00 pm, the music gets even louder to emulate a club like atmosphere."}
{"text":"The star of the show was hands down the pickled jalapeño whipped butter. The butter was a fluffy cloud of joy in my mouth. It was followed by some super salty pork belly appetizers. Ordered the seared scallops with potato cakes which was good except the scallops would've been better had it been seared on both sides and not just one. Also ordered the wasabi crusted yellowtail tuna which was also good. The side of broccoli was good but not worth $8 for a little bowl. It's a hip and trendy spot, but seems a bit douchey and pretentious. There was one time we came in for brunch and we were greeted very rudely by the host. She was pretty snarky when we responded no that we did not have a reservation."}
{"text":"So, I have not been here for a meal. My review is for the Saturday late night crowd (after 10) and my feelings are mixed.   Pros: -everyone here is attractive...or at least the men are well dressed and the women are small enough to barely wear anything and still look stylish -drinks are good and strong -bartenders are nice and attentive, rare for these type of trendy Uptown bars. -no cover  Cons: -everyone here is attractive! Do not expect to come here in flats and a sundress and fit in. (Or if you are a man, heaven forbid...shorts!) in fact if you don't spend at least 60% of your time at the gym, eat any carbs, or are a woman weighing over 105 you might feel out of place. -a bit pricey  Side note: This place is like the cool kids table in middle school. You get invited and it's exciting but once you're actually there you realize they're all a bit douchey and you kind of miss goofing off with your dorky friends."}
{"text":"Great DECOR!!! Pay attention to design details. I had the shrimp, mushroom, omelette with home fries. The home fries are very fresh. The mimosa's were the best I ever had. Great Customer service. A very low key GEM. Good pricing... I will for sure be coming back."}
{"text":"Our server was great. The lamb burger was great and really cannot eat lamb.  This was fantastic!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Lets call it what it is, trendy food and a trendy atmosphere.  Service was pretty good.  Went to 5 Church in Friday night and were seated promptly.  Pretty good crowd and everyone was dressed in \"going out\" clothes.  The menu was pretty straightforward new American.  The food itself seemed more about quality ingredients and fancy presentation than taste.  My romaine  salad was ok, could have done with out 2 whole anchovies and soft boiled eggs.  Steak was a great cut of meat, a little on the expensive side though. My wife enjoyed her green salad and scallops. Out total bill was 91 before tip.   Good meal but I would rather eat at a less trendy spot for a little less money."}
{"text":"First time for us because we were given a gift card as a present and it's safe to say we probably won't be back.   The atmosphere and the decor in 5church is really cool and the host was awesome, I didn't catch her name though.  Showed up early for our reservation and didn't get sat until about 20 minutes after the time we were actually supposed to be there. The entire part of service was incredibly slow from getting a drink at the bar while we waited, or at least attempting too, 2 bartenders approached us w menus, one let me try one of the wines I was asking about but never came back to us before we finally got sat. The greet from the server took forever, getting our order took forever, and the food took even longer. The manager got us a free round of drinks and apologized for the long wait but both filets were suuuuuuper undercooked (which is surprising considering it took 45 minutes), the broccoli tasted like seafood, and the whipped potatoes had no flavor at all, super super bland.   The smores trifle was pretty much the only thing that would bring me back to this restaurant.   Definitely not worth $130."}
{"text":"I cannot speak to their main entrees, we came here for drinks and appetizers. We came during July 4th 2012. For fourth of July, this place is not crowded at all, which is surprising if it's supposed to be a big hit in town? I do have to commend and say that their interior decor is breath taking. Everything other reviewers have said are true. The waiter did not seem super attentive, he was just acceptable. He only came by once during our entire stay. The drinks are fairly pricey, but this is an upscale place. We tried 3 different appetizers on their dinner menu, and all three were very mediocre. I hope their cuisine entrees are better."}
{"text":"I went here this past weekend for a first date. It was a cool spot for sure.. Great atmosphere, hip music and beautiful decor combined with the delicious appetizers and wine made for a very good first date! The music was a little loud and it was tough to have a real convo without yelling but at least the music was good! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was visiting for work and our hotel recommended dinner at this restaurant, great recommendation!   The atmosphere of the restaurant is trendy, modern, very low lighting restaurant. They are known for their 60 second steak which is cooked on one side. Unfortunately I wasn't craving steak, I know its a crime! Instead I got the seared sea scallops with a side order of spinach. The way the sweet potatoes were done blew my mind away as they were mashed and so tasty. The amount of food was perfect where you didn't feel like a fatty after licking your plate clean.   I was so full from dinner I didn't have a chance to try out their dessert so the next time I'm in Charlotte I will need to stop by for that!"}
{"text":"Best Sea Scallops I've ever had.  Dark Horse Chardonnay a winner, chilled just to right temp.  Service was rushed though, like they were trying to get us out so they could seat next table.  And don't sit at the green bench seats-the tables were not designed to work well with the bench seats and had to lean forward whole time."}
{"text":"Snobby!!!!  Bartender bends over and then whips back up to clear her hair back from her face!!! (not in an attractive way!)  Alejandro(?) stalks about the bar with a flunkie looking down his nose at everyone & everything while muttering imprecations towards his staff for his flunkie to pass on for him.   The staff huddles and chats loudly to each other at the end of the bar (as they ignore Alejandro & he ignores them)  I don't see, taste, hear anything about this place that makes it premier or even visit worthy except the space itself."}
{"text":"Having wanted to try 5 Church for some time, we headed there for brunch before a Carolina Panthers game.  The dining room was busy; but, quite quiet, so conversation was easy; which, in a large space as 5 Church, was a bit surprising and welcome.  We were seeking good brunch fare and were not disappointed with our croque madame and scrambled eggs with bacon.  The croquet madame was very substantial and the bacon and eggs came exactly as ordered.  But, alas, there was one slight disappointment; though it was not the fault of 5 Church.  It appears that Charlotte still lingers in the depth of blue law hell.  So, no mimosas; no bloody marys...  But, the lack of our cocktails of choice was made up for with excellent coffee.  we'll most certainly be back; albeit a bit later in the day..."}
{"text":"The food- excellent!  We are gluten free and dairy free and they worked w us well.  Our server was excellent too.  What wasn't of good taste was the manager who asked us to move from our table to the bar because of a reservation that someone else had for our table.  (We had a reservation too.). He asked us to move even before our bill was signed... Not a good ending to our anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I just moved here from Austin Tx and the food is awesome and the atmosphere is even better! The mussels are to die for!"}
{"text":"The staff and ambience are both excellent. However, besides the amazing Tokyo street corn special appetizer, the food was overall lacking in flavor. We ordered the permanent tuna dish and the special NC trout dish. Both seriously lacked in flavor, with only a tiny amount of bland sauce that was supposed to cover a large amount of bland fish. However, I will say both fish were cooked perfectly. The Brussels sprouts we ordered on the side had a good sauce, but it was severely undercooked; it was actually inedible. We were so disappointed after eating an especially flavorful appetizer, only to receive lackluster entrees that did not deserve the $30 price tag. Probably not returning."}
{"text":"went here for a girls' night out, and it was a good trip. the food was pretty darn good, and the service was great considering our large group and all the different demands. a bit on the loud side for me for dinner, so i don't know that i would come here other than with girlfriends, cuz we're already geared up to talking real loud together."}
{"text":"Friends and I decided to come here on a sat night for a couple after dinner drinks. We were in awe of how cute the decor was and fell in love with this little place. Then we got to take a look at the menu and decided to try to come for brunch the next morning. We were in luck that they had availability and made reservations while we were there. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. You can really tell they all work well together and always want to make their guests happy. Numerous staff members were asking if we were ok or needed anything. It was the same for brunch the next morning. Their coffee set up was as impressive as the decor! They had a little plate with sugar cubes, cream, and even jelly beans! The food was also amazing. I got the crab cake Benedict, which was small but just enough, and my friends got some sort of eggs and biscuit with mushrooms, asparagus, and a truffle cream sauce. They both said it was amazing and were so full afterwards. I cannot wait to come back to this adorable place and try out the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"The service and food here was fantastic! We came here because of the reviews and it lived up to them entirely. We actually were surprised to find out they had a $30 prix fix style menu I believe. You got a few choices for starter, dinner and dessert. I HIGHLY recommend doing that. Below is the food we got: -Corn chowder- creamy base, very good, lots of corn in it -local greens- who doesn't love goat cheese on a salad? Yum! -Salmon (we all got it)- fantastic, nice crisp, flavorful, the soy vinegarette complimented it well, cooked perfectly -white chocolate cheesecake- very good and dense- just like a cheesecake should be -red velvet torte- good but didn't have that \"bam-red velvet\" taste -s'mores trifle- the favorite hands down. It tasted like a s'more with a warm brownie base! Yumx3!  So the food and service was great! My only complaint was the bathrooms. The ladies bathroom downstairs has 2 stalls and both were out of toliet paper- no biggie- I asked the hostess for more. She looked and couldn't find any, so she asked the manager who also could not find any. They then sent me upstairs to use that bathroom. The manager walked in before me (which I thought was strange as it was a man) and I walked in to find a single stall with no one in there. There is a second door that was unlocked going into the kitchen. So basically I was using the employees bathroom and boy did it stink!!!! It smelled like dirty wet gym socks that have been locked in there for a week. It was awful. And on top of it, it was awkward because how is the kitchen staff supposed to know that someone is in there so I locked that door- probably locking the staff out of the bathroom (oops- but I didn't want someone walking in on me). I later overheard the manager saying something about  not having any toliet paper- which I thought was very strange. So loss of a star for the facilites not being kept up."}
{"text":"Meh- food was just ok.  Nothing special at all.  I liked the atmosphere alot and when I'm looking for more of a cool scene and good cocktails I'll go back, but if Im looking for really great food I think there is much better.  It was very loud, so not the place to go to chat with your friends."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night (5/17/14) with a group of friends. I would rate my dinner as one of my best of 2014 so far! It was delicious in every way! I started with a glass of Zinfandel from the bar that was massive. A friend had the wild berry Mojito. That's definitely on my list for the next time! It was amazing! Then I had the local field greens salad. Delicious and a very large portion. I ordered the 60 second strip. Delicious. Cooked to perfection. Paired with the bleu cheese sauce and asparagus...couldn't have been better.  Finished up with the white chocolate cheesecake. Perfection. Visually beautiful and equally tasty. I highly recommend 5Church on any given day! And the free valet topped of impeccable service inside and out."}
{"text":"I went here for the first day of Restaurant Week and had one of the best meals I've had in Charlotte so far.   I love the decor of this place. It's really cute and modern. The chairs could've been more comfortable, but that's a minor complaint.   The heirloom tomato/watermelon/burrata salad was amazing. Very juicy delicious tomatoes. Next up was the filet mignon with some fingerling potatoes. My steak was cooked perfectly...it was seriously one of the best filets I've had in my life. Dessert was a triumph with the s'mores trifle. I love s'mores anything, so it was a big hit.   Cocktails aren't cheap, but they're great. The rosemary gin fizz was refreshing, with nice herbal notes that weren't overpoweringly woodsy. I had another vodka drink (can't recall its name), which was also delicious.   Our server was polite and attentive, and he was honest about his likes and dislikes there, which helped us choose cocktails and our dishes. I appreciated that.   We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Myself and a large group of friends went to 5Church for their New Years Eve party and were treated like garbage. They promised an open bar and full buffet, yet only served dry mashed potatoes and pita chips, while the drinks were completely watered down. They apparently forgot that people need utensils to eat food with because we had to use the hardened pita chips to eat the mashed potatoes, which were tasteless and appeared to have been made from a box. At one point, an extremely rude waitress actually told my friend to \"get the fuck out of my way\" because she was busy trying to serve the private dinner party that they had booked upstairs. They forgot to bring out the champagne toast at midnight because apparently they do not know how to tell time, and the waitresses snippily refused to serve champagne to many people when they finally decided to do a toast at 12:45 am.  All in all, it felt like we were crashing someone else's wedding and were treated by the staff and management as such. I would never recommend going to 5Church based on the fact that their management were so horribly uncaring when people called to voice their concerns and essentially brushed off the entire ordeal."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten her before, several times. In the past, the food has been very good. This time however, it was not. We had a 7pm reservation on Saturday night and were directed to the Bar upon arrival, as there \"were no available tables\", even though there were plenty of non occupied tables. We order: Octopus, Meatballs, Ceviche for apps, then Lamb Shank, Scallops, Fried Chicken. So lets start with what was good; Ceviche (not good but great), Fried Chicken, (very good). Now for the bad, Octopus was over seasoned and over cooked, scallops were cold, lamb shank was dry and hot, but the potatoes it sat on were cold, meatballs, (which normally are excellent) were dry. My wife had a margarita and I had a beer, my niece had Tea. Waiter was very attentive, but I'm not sending all  this food back. Our bill? Wait for it......$180.00, Before Tip!. There are at least 20 other restaurants in Charlotte where you can spend 180 bucks and get an outstanding meal, this place isn't one of them. Stop reading the \"Best of Charlotte\" reviews, avoid this place."}
{"text":"This was our third time dining at 5Church. The first two times the food was spectacular and deserved the price tag next to them, however this most recent visit was different. I'm not sure if the original exec chef is now devoting his time to Nan & Bryons, but quality has gone down. My husband and I started with the shiitake perogies which were good. The dough was nice and flaky and the filling was tasty. No complaints there. We also started with the crab cakes on the snack menu. These were disappointing, the flavor profiles that they used didn't meld together. The sweet apples and raisins mixing with the heavily peppered cakes and bitter shoots left my mouth confused. We then moved onto our mains. My husband ordered the short rib tortellini special and I ordered the scallops which our server promptly suggested when I asked what was best. The short rib filling was well seasoned and packed with flavor, unfortunately the pasta wrapped around it had been seared for a brief second on one side leaving a terrible texture reminiscent of uncooked pasta. The sauce was nice and again they made sure to glob on more pea shoots. My scallops were disappointing. The scallops while cooked perfectly were cold and gritty, two things that make one of my favorite proteins undesirable. The apricot compote was nice and refreshing and added needed citrus to the plate. However the spaghetti squash that sat underneath the whole dish took on a soggy quality and the brussel sprouts came to me cold. We passed on dessert fearing a lack of quality in that dimension as well. Service was decent our server was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed however her bald manager made no attempts to conceal his texting addiction, it's amazing we didn't watch him fall down the stairs. Overall I'm not sure we will return as we were fairly disappointed."}
{"text":"Really pretty place! Food was great as well. Husband got the lamb burger and it was one of the most juiciest burger out there! And I got the fresh buttermilk biscuits with pouched eggs, really delicious with lots of flavor, only wished there was more mushroom added. My only thing was I didn't enjoy their coffee flavor. But each there own with coffee bean flavor."}
{"text":"Fun ambiance, great drinks... Mediocre food. Mussels came out undercooked and chef refused to fix them."}
{"text":"If you are visiting Charlotte or living anywhere within 2 hours you absolutely have to go! The service and food are incredible and I have never had a negative experience. From the brunch menu on Sunday mornings, to happy hour drinks, and exquisite dinners, you can't go wrong! I especially give praise to the manager Nick, he always takes care of me and my guests to make sure we have the best experience possible! I hope 5Church keeps expanding all over the States! Bravo the whole staff and the talented chefs!"}
{"text":"I visited 5Church for a business lunch with a vendor.  The vendor had been before and liked it and it's been on my list to try.    We met at 1:30 on a Friday so we missed the lunch rush.  I immediately liked the vibe and decor very much.  The servers were very friendly and attentive.    Since the vendor had been before, I was happy to trust her judgment for the appetizer choices.  She ordered Black Bean Hummus and Beet Sliders.  The hummus was delicious!  The fresh olive oil, line juice, and cilantro really made the dish cone alive.  The Beet Sliders completely knocked my socks off!!!  I will return to 5Church just for these Sliders...they were THAT good!  We also ordered the lunch special salad... Quinoa patties over greens with a lemon vinaigrette with oranges and goat cheese.  It was tasty, but the patties were a tad on the dry side.    I can't wait to go back with my husband... perhaps for brunch?   Good food AND Mimosas... yes, please!!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty pleased with this place so far. The lamb burger is great. Juicy, flavorful, not too rich and not dried out.  On the other hand, the giant fry logs that come with it aren't very good. While they look cool they lack flavor and are tough. I also ordered the chickpea salad and tried some of the lobster mac and cheese and I wasn't blown away by either.  Still the lamb burger is excellent and I'm excited to try the other menus. The crew seems like they have their stuff together which is impressive for a restaurant open less than 2 weeks."}
{"text":"We had a 40th birthday celebration with 5 couples on Saturday night.  It was absolutely the worst service I have ever had hands down, the waiter was extremely rude, apps were good, dinner was served 50 minute after ordered, scallops overlooked and flavors bland.  Bartenders were also inattentive and dismissive.  So many more gems in Charlotte, I would not waste Time or money here.  From a seasoned waitress/bartender from Dallas, TX."}
{"text":"This is really nice place. I like location and vibe. Food was very good. I want to come back!"}
{"text":"Don't come hungry or on a schedule!   Limited menu but good food. Service was inattentive and slow. Stated at 11:10 for 11:15 reservation. Food didn't come until after 12:30. I was just about to head for the doors and Qdoba around the corner when our food actually came.  They need to do better!"}
{"text":"My husband and I heard great things about 5Church so we decided to give it a try for lunch one day. The ambience is nice and it's in a great location. We didn't have any trouble parking right across the street. We started with the calamari (which was misspelled on the menu - really?!) with tomato and ghost pepper aioli. The calamari itself was fine, very tender, but the batter was a little too greasy. We expected the ghost chili aioli to have at least a little bit of spice to it, but nothing. It tasted like mayo with some paprika. My husband ordered the classic burger and he enjoyed it, cooked the way he wanted, but nothing spectacular. My real problem came with my order. I ordered the mussels and fries. If I'm in a restaurant that has moules frites on their menu, I will probably order it 95% of them time. When my mussels came out, several of the mussels were closed shut. I pushed those aside and ate the few that were open. By the end of the meal, I realized that about 60% of the mussels were closed. For those that don't know, if a mussel is closed even after being cooked, it means that it was not fresh and was dead before it was even cooked. It it not considered safe to eat these mussels. These should not be eaten, let alone served at a restaurant. I have never received a dish of moules frites with so many closed mussels. The most I've received are maybe one or two, never the majority of a dish. If a dish cannot be prepared properly and safely, it shouldn't be on a menu. I don't know that we'll be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered the filet mignon with creamy potatoes. My meal was delicious! Everything on the menu was a bit pricey, but well worth it and the atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Sunday with a few friends. I got the salmon, one friend got the steak, and another got the waffles. Everything was delicious! The portions were a bit small for me personally, but my one friend didn't finish her waffle so take my criticism with a grain of salt. Be warned, they are no longer serving bottomless mimosas or sangria because of a recent state law, but the per glass price of each is so low you can easily order two or three glasses without feeling it in your pocket.   I've already told several people about this place since visiting a few weeks ago so I obviously recommend it. I will definitely come back whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte for the first time,Went with 5 co workers for late dinner arrived after 9pm Seated immediately.  Busy,Loud and quite dark! Tried the meatballs, octupus and hummus for appetizers.  Octupus was tender and delicious.  For dinner I had the roasted beet salad. Scallops, pork tenderloin and chicken are huge servings.  Beet salad was good. For dessert we tried the 3 flavor sorbet (coco, berry and mango) lemon creme brûlée and coconut mouse.  All 3 desserts were excellent!   Ambiance=4 Food= 4 Service =4 Will visit again when in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice as more often to hang out and drink then actually eat dinner.  This place is definitely a \"you-get-what-you-pay-for\" type place, and you definitely pay.  The prices are high for some food and drinks, but the service for dining was great as the wait staff are knowledgeable and very professional.  I tried the jerk chicken lettuce, which was meh, but the Pork Belly snack was delicious.  I could munch on those all night if I wanted to splurge, as only two pieces were served for a $4 snack dish.  I wouldn't come hungry.  But most people probably come here for the atmosphere which doesn't disappoint.  The crowd is impressive and come if you want to be seen.  I'm probably too old for that, but at least the music they were playing was popular in my partying days, which says alot about the age of the crowd.  The only annoying part of the experience was the headlights that would always shine into the restaurant as cars are turning onto Church St. from 5th.  This was a distraction for me, but if you're going to be clubbing afterwards anyways, might as well prepare for the flashing lights here."}
{"text":"The outside already suggests 'classy,' but the inside is definitely worth mentioning. It has a really modern feel, but not too in-your-face about it.  The hostess that normally is in front slowly transitions into a bouncer as the night progresses. I haven't eaten an actual meal here, but friends have been raving about their lamb burger. Given the fact that its one of the most affordable entrees ($13) and looks amazing, this will definitely be my order when I come here for dinner!   The beverages are what one would expect from a Charlotte bar, but I will also mention that they have some craft beers and local favorites (Highland Brewing, Four Friends, etc)! This fact has earned them their fourth star! Prices are a little steep for drinks, but given the environment of 5Church, not too surprising, and not at all a deal-breaker. I still very much recommend this place for a chill night out with friends.   Noting my friend Grace's review: 'if you look all the way up, you'll get to see that the ceiling is black with words written all over in white.' - excellent detail!"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon we made a reservation with the OpenTable App for same day at 7:45pm for 2 people. We've got there in time and were right away seated. Our server was very nice and friendly. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great - the place was busy but no hectic so you feel really comfortable. As a starter we shared the tuna tartare which was great - only thing with a tartare you should get some toasted bread or some crostini at least. But probably that's still the European in me ;-). I took the shellfish pasta as a main. It was just great. The server told me the size is between a starter and main. For me it was perfect size. I still like to finish my dishes (if the food is good) and not have it boxed or even worse generate a lot of food waste. So perfect size, perfect taste I finished it all. My wife had the salmon - also perfectly cooked. We finished with the lemon tart also nice sized (not big) item to finish also a great meal. I asked for a Grappa to really close the dinner - unfortunately they had none - I know another European thing so stay with the brandy they have some  (but I haven't tried it)."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch today, and I was very impressed with the food! I ordered the french onion roast beef, which came with a standard side of fries. It doesn't sound like anything all that special, but it was awesome food! The roast beef was very tender and juicy. The caramelized onion compote was extremely flavorful and really pulled the whole sandwich together when combined with awesome melted provolone cheese. The bun was toasted to perfection as well. Even the fries were above average in my opinion; not too crispy/burnt but not soggy or greasy either. Our server was friendly and quick to refill drinks as well. With a price of only $12 for a big sandwich and good sized side of fries I can't complain about anything."}
{"text":"We came to Charlotte for the weekend and ending up eating at this place by chance, when most restaurants were shut on the evening of Nascar Sunday and we were pleasantly surprised by how good it was. I had the petite fillet steak which, especially considering the low price, was amazing! So well cooked. My boyfriend decided to go for a selection of appetizers including the sliders, tomato soup and the shrimp flatbed - all of which he enjoyed although he was jealous of my steak! Note that the appetizer portions were all rather large so three of them was definitely too much food.  The decor is brilliant too - the whole ceiling is covered in painted on quotes. Overall, loved the atmosphere in here. Only thing I did not like was the temperature - it was freezing! Considering it was 80 degrees outside we did not have sweaters so make sure you bring one along!"}
{"text":"This place is hot for a reason! The decor is inviting, chic and cool all at the same time. The food presentation is very good. The food itself is solid. The muscles are the best I've ever had. I got the scallops this last time and they were perfect.   What stands out most to me about 5Church is the staff. They are attentive, kind and good at their jobs. Every time I go, I'm blown away by how great I'm treated. 5Chuch is the whole package."}
{"text":"Haven't been in a long time but went for Restaurant Week; it was excellent!    Food was delicious, although I think they went a little overboard with the Serrano pepper in my Ahi Tuna Poke.    My original dessert order was the Coconut Lime mousse, which I had to send back and exchange for the S'mores Trifle - it tastes burnt, like maybe they scalded the milk.  But the manager was gracious and accommodating.    Good service, nice atmosphere.  And the wine flight is worth it."}
{"text":"The vibe here is very cool and the food is fun and different and worth checking out for client dinners, dates, etc. uptown. It's busy but not too loud for conversation and it's dark at night so bring your readers or your flashlight app if you are old like me.   We had the pork belly spring rolls and they were tasty but there look to be lots of great app options that will have to wait until next time.   For dinner my buddy got the 60 second steak which was tender and flavorful with a great sauce that didn't overpower the meat. Our client had the chicken and mashed potatoes and was quite pleased. I had the scallops with corn and I loved it. Enough food, not heavy and the scallops were perfectly cooked.   The dark chocolate pretzel covered caramel bar is the dessert to get though we also shared the pound cake which grew on us too but couldn't top the elevated Twix bar dessert.   Good wine and beer selection, bar is hopping. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here for our anniversary dinner 7/20. While we were seated promptly even though we were early for our reservation the customer service ended there. After being seated and our beverage orders taken, we waited 30 minutes with no interaction from either of the two waitresses in the upper level of the restaurant. This is after one of them slid between our table and placed her bottom on our table to take an order from the couple next to us. I'm not sure why our waitress (long dark hair shaved on her left side) was surprised when I asked for check for our tea and ginger ale. Although she suddenly became very interested, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Did you hear? Chef Jamie Lynch is on Top Chef season 14! Pop bottles.   5Church is the swanky, cool kid on the block. The interior is beautiful. I can't even begin to tell you how many birthday/bachelorette/event/-insert reason to celebrate- dinners here. I send people this way all the time.   The menu changes seasonally, but there's also some longtime staples on the menu like the lamb burger and 60 second steak. In all honesty, I can't think of a meal here I didn't enjoy. My current obsession is the ahi tuna poke. The avocado, serranos, pineapple, soy sherry, it's just a great combination of flavors. The award for most surprising dish I've had in the past couple months here is the chicken adobo. Why do I say that? Well, I'm not someone who will go to a restaurant and order chicken. In my head, I can make chicken at home (I know, I know... not anywhere near restaurant quality, but still). I would order this chicken. It's packed with flavor and delicious. The Viper is my go-to cocktail. Lunch-wise, I love the Italian Hoagie and French Onion Roast Beef. Guys, it's like French Onion soup in a sandwich! And it's delicious.   Follow 5Church on Instagram to see the latest pics of menu items. Parking- they offer complimentary valet. Make sure to bring some cash to tip!   I'm a huge fan of Chef Jamie, Patrick, Alejandro, Ayman and the entire team. They do great work and their passion shows. One of the coolest things I've ever witnessed was a night out with some of the kitchen guys here. To hear them all talk about how much admiration and respect they have for Chef Jamie, it says a lot."}
{"text":"5Church is the good looking place you die to go but once you get there you are terribly underwhelmed. The ambiance is perfect and the wait staff is amazingly friendly.  The food is just ok... I had the crab cakes and poached eggs, I enjoyed it.  The one thing that made this amazingly beautiful restaurant with an awesome staff and decent food loose points was the fact that the restaurant was hot... like literally burning up. I was there for about an hour and 15 mins bc that was my max, I was literally sweating when I left the restaurant and walking outside was a relief. I believe this heat debacle was a one off and because of that I would continue to patronize 5Church. Although the food was just good... the drinks were awesome and the ambiance was worth another trip."}
{"text":"I came here with a few coworkers for dinner, and it seemed like a decent place to eat at.  Even the yelp reviews gave us positive expectations!  Unfortunately, we all came out of this place pretty disappointed.  It could have been we ordered the wrong items? but regardless I was hoping at least 1 of the three items would have been above average.  Here is what we got:  -Chicken leg meal:  This was not very appetizing.  The presentation seemed very nice, but looks were deceiving for this dish.  The chicken was utterly dry even for dark meat!  The side of fries were the best part of the meal, and they were soggy.   -Special of the night (red snapper): This wins the most disappointing dish of the night.  You would think the special of this night would be pretty good.  But this dish's fish was thin and rather small (not filling), and it was overcooked so much that it was not possible to finish.    -Braised short ribs: This was probably the most acceptable dish that we ordered, and it was still over cooked.    I don't know if this place recently got new ovens/stoves and do not know how to tame their cooking heat or it just their style of cooking? Well the wait staff was very friendly, and attentive.  Probably will not be back, but definitely check it out and decide for yourself if you like it! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went to 5Church for dinner on a Friday in December. Got there at 6 and the restaurant was starting to fill up. Started with wine, which is always good. We ended up ordering a bunch of appetizers to share so we could get a taste of everything.   Wedge salad was good. Pork belly spring rolls were a favorite (wish they came with more than 4 little pieces). Jerk chicken lettuce wraps were average- not as much chicken as I would have preferred.  Shrimp flat bread had an interesting taste which we attributed to the boursin cheese. Flat bread was circular shaped (like a pizza) but the pieces were too thin and flimsy to hold and eat. Would have been better  if it was a square made flat bread and the crust a little more crispy. Carolina gold \"hoppin' John\" was just rice and it was plain.   Ordered a bottle of wine and the waiter corked it for us to-go at the end of the night. The only brown paper bag he had was a large to-go food bag so he wrapped our wine bottle in the bag and handed it to us (...very odd).  Decent food but for the price I would have expected more. Not going to rush back there any time soon."}
{"text":"We arrived around 2 on a Sunday. We were sat immediately outside. Unfortunately,  they no longer have bottomless mimosas or sangrias but both are $2.50. Our food was delicious and our server was very nice. No complaints!"}
{"text":"My sister's birthday party was here last weekend and I had an ok time. The waiter was a little rude, but oooooonly slightly. The atmosphere and food itself was pretty good. We tried the chick pea salad and black bean hummus. The restaurant put a little card on the table for the birthday girl, which I realize is a nice thought; however, they left another card on the table for a different party (that I guess cancelled?). LOL. Their tables are a little far apart and it makes it difficult to have conversation, but it was not a huge deal. Anyway, overall it was an ok time."}
{"text":"Agree with others, food is decent and ambience makes the place. But that alone should not be the deciding factor for a 4-5. I had more than one experience with not so great smells from the kitchen (heavy bad fish smell) and emitting from the bathroom during my dinner. Really turned me off a couple times. But, this was during Restaurant week so maybe it factored into it. For the whole experience and only good food, I would say the most I can muster is a 3."}
{"text":"To be honest, the only thing that saved our experience here was the service.   She was a real treat.   Other than that, it smelled like fish when we walked in, and not in a good way.   The menu was tiny, not varied, and TOO expensive, especially the tiny portions.  To top it all off, the food was subpar.  However, the wine list and wines were good."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my mom on a Wednesday.  We were immediately seated.  The atmosphere is very cool and a definite conversation starter.  I may have felt some slight judgment when we asked for the wine list, but oh well, it was my day off!  My glass of chenin blanc (a new to me variety) was so delicious, I could have had a second glass!  We split the romaine salad with ceaser dressing, anchovies and olives.  This is THE BEST take on a ceaser salad I have ever had. Salty, lemony, so many elements that I love! We also shared the lamb burger which, I have to say while it's smaller than the Liberty's, I think it wins in the taste test contest.  Bursting with flavor in every bite.  I could have eaten the entire thing!    I can't wait to try 5Church for dinner.  A GREAT new addition to downtown."}
{"text":"The food was great! I really enjoyed the salmon, eggs and fries. My friends had the Belgian Waffles.  The ambiance is chill and will go back for date night!!"}
{"text":"I went to 5church on a Friday night around 8.  I was pretty busy but our server arrived promptly and had a great attitude.  As many have said this place has a great trendy modern but classic feel to it.  Great for our girls night and great for a date night.   For the food each one of us ordered something different so we could sample each others food- salmon, trout, flounder, jerk chicken appetizer and greens.  All were very tasty.  The Trout was my favorite and that would be my entree if i were to return.  I had the jerk chichen appetizer as my main meal because i wasnt $25 dollars worth of hungry...but though it was good the portions for the appetizers are very small.  Not big enough to share with anyone.  The \"bites\" on the menu dont waste you time...its really a bite..like a spoonfull of something.  Save that money an buy a drink, which were also good and had a great balance of taste and alcohol.  Over all pretty good.  But bring your wallet and dont be super hungry."}
{"text":"Third time I have visited 5 Church.  Now that I know where they are, it helps. If that sounds stupid (they are at 5 Church, idiot), please note on the website and Google maps the address is Tryon street. Try going on a busy Friday or Saturday night and realize you have to circle the maze of one way streets to actually get in front of the restaurant. Very frustrating and a little puzzling that owners don't try to change their business listing to remedy this.  The place is beautiful - and they have beautiful people working there. I have always liked any server we have had, but find the bartenders dismissive and condescending. Yes, I know you are busy, but it is your job, right? Not making eye contact so I can get your attention to get a drink is not good bartending. It has been my experience every visit.  The food is avant-garde - love. Last time we got the tuna tartare small plate. The diced jicama was a great textural addition. Warning though, this is very very hot (spicy). Next time I will ask to dial back the scotch bonnet. The bread served with it however was a total miss. Would not hold up to the meat being place on it. Perhaps if it were toasted or a crisp bread, or even more of a cupped - type shape to drop the tuna into it would be more successful.  We got a few other small plates. Spicy is the name of the game here folks so order accordingly. All was well executed.  It's noisy here, but our table was small enough that we could hear each other talk just fine, even with the table next to us so close I could have eaten from their plates. :)"}
{"text":"The music is loud, true.  But the food is amazing.  Try the Shrimp pizza, out of this world good."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a low rating but I wasn't a fan.  We ate here a few months ago for our Valentine's Day dinner. I'd been wanting to try this place out for awhile & was really looking forward to our meal! Between my BF & I, we had 3 cocktails, 2 snacks, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 1 side item. The bill was around $120 (not including the tip), which I thought would've been fair if the majority of food & drinks we had were actually good.  The 3 cocktails we ordered were the New-Fashioned, Viper, & the 5Church. Both the New-Fashioned & the 5Church sounded great on paper but were executed poorly. They were really watered down.. Gross. The New-Fashioned was supposed to be rimmed with nuts, which is already weird, but it's the NEW-Fashioned so just go with it, right? Mine was only halfway rimmed- sloppy presentation. The Viper, made up of Patron Silver, orange liqueur, lime juice, cucumber water, & cayenne pepper, was an interesting combination & surprisingly a really good one! It was refreshing with a little kick to it. So 1 out of 3 cocktails were acceptable. K  For our 2 snacks, BF got the Szechuan Pork Belly & I got the Black Bean Hummus. On the menu, it states that the Black Bean Hummus comes with grilled flat bread. Awesome, I love flat bread! Well, grilled flat bread my ass. I was expecting something pillowy & soft. What I got instead were extremely salty, nasty pita chips. Totally INEDIBLE. Whoever wrote the description on the menu obviously didn't know the difference between GRILLED & FRIED. Here's a tip 5Church: How about don't write something misleading on the menu next time? The hummus itself was pretty tasty so I ended up eating the hummus by itself. BF said the Pork Belly was pretty good, but kind of salty.  The 2 apps we ordered were the Truffled Shiitake Mushroom Pierogies and Artisan Cheese Selection. The pierogies were my favorite part of the meal. Buttery, crisp exterior and flavorful filling. AND NOT TOO SALTY. Perfect. The cheese plate consisted of 3 different types of cheeses, 2 types of fruit preserves, olive tapenade, and were served with crostini, sweet peppers, and olives. The cheeses were good, but I didn't really care for any of the accompaniments, besides the peppers and olives.  BF had the Scallop entree and I ordered the Crispy Marinated Tofu. The tofu comes with sauteed spinach, kimchi, and green beans. The tofu didn't taste like it was marinated. The only flavor I got from it was salt from the breading. The spinach and green beans were the best part of the entree. The kimchi was such a FAIL. Now, I know that being half Korean, I can't really get my hopes up about finding good kimchi anywhere, besides my mom's. I also know that the kimchi that was on my plate SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SERVED. It was ridiculously salty, gingery, & dry?! .. Just disgusting and a sad, pathetic excuse for kimchi. I never do this, but I took one bite and immediately spit it back out. Only someone with busted taste buds would actually swallow something so revolting. BF's scallops were decent but he said they were a little heavy-handed with the salt as well.  Finally my side. I got the Creamy Mashed Potatoes because I love mashed potatoes! I thought it was a little pricey for a SIDE ($7) but changed my mind when I saw the HUGE serving of what I thought would be deliciousness. Well guess what, it was extremely salty. Big surprise, no? It wasn't as terrible as the kimchi, but I could only stand to eat a few bites of it.   There are a few redeeming qualities. Our server was on top of it for such a busy night. Our food & drinks came out in a timely manner and our waters never got less than halfway full. I also loved the whole ambiance of the restaurant. Dark, trendy atmosphere and they really paid attention to detail when decorating the place. It really looked like a great date spot. So, points for that.  If you like excessively salty foods, you will probably love this restaurant. If you're someone with normal taste buds, you have been warned. I might try this restaurant again one day but I'm definitely not in any rush."}
{"text":"Heard  all kinds of great things about the lamb burger and home made fries.  Did NOT disappoint. Wonderful experience"}
{"text":"Made reservations for New Year's Eve dinner. Arrived and, unfortunately, there were people staying at tables longer than anticipated. 40 minutes later, we still didn't have a table. Staff were pleasant when we checked in to see if or table was ready but no one made a point to let us know anything. The atmosphere was very nice and the crowd had a nice vibe. If convenient, may make another attempt.  The owner/manager did reach out and offer apologies... which I can really appreciate.  Wife and I rarely make it uptown for meals and I would really love the opportunity to give this place an updated review."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch and it was super cute and trendy. When we were there a lot of people were celebrating their birthday so it seems really good for big groups and that kind of scene. They have really good (and cheap) mimosa and sangria deals, and the mimosas are actually good. The food looked good and to my surprise, tasted as good as it looks. To top it all off the service was great as well. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Time for an update - I really love this place.  I'm so glad it's been able to hold it down at the corner of Fifth and Church... even the name of the place is an ode to the trials and tribulations that restaurants and bars have had at that location.  5Church is one of my favorite places to grab lunch or happy hour in Charlotte.  Lunch is really great bc they understand the lunchtime mentality.  The servers are on-point and the kitchen delivers quality lunch in a timely fashion.  The lunch execution is near flawless.  Refills appear magically.  If you get a chance to try their filet burger special, please order it.  The jalapeño aioli has a little kick that goes so well with the tasty patty.  Sesame seed bun - absolutely.  If you're a beet fan, the beet sliders are legit.  The only problem with those guys is that after a couple of small sliders, you'll be craving beets the rest of the afternoon.  BTW, beets - where have you been all my life???  Place is nice, ladies look gorgeous, and modern look is sweet.  They have an upstairs area for private dining - it worked well for a work function one other time.  There's a private bar there, but getting beer is a pain since they get it from below.  Nonetheless, cool atmosphere for a private dining event.  Looking forward to the next happy hour which I can hopefully roll right into a dinner experience there.  dmo out."}
{"text":"What, why doesn't 5Church have higher ratings here on Yelp?! Yes, the prices are higher than many CLT restaurants, but you get what you pay for. Plus, a place like this would be even more expensive in NYC, so, for us it was a steal. First off, the staff are totally lovely. Really a genuinely friendly and attentive group of people. As a customer, you feel valued and welcome. Interior is comfortable and clean with hip, quirky decor.  As for the food, we were very satisfied. 5Church is clearly using fresh, high end ingredients. The fish does not taste fishy, the lamb does not taste gamy, vegetables are served at their peak flavor/freshness.  I mentioned that yesterday was my birthday and the staff went out of their way to help me celebrate! We had a fantastic time at 5Church and would certainly visit again!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. A Charlotte restaurant week WIN!!! Most places skimp and this one did not. Service was impeccable and even cramped in the middle tables, we were delighted - food was delicious, fresh and came out better than our expectations. Seriously, that s'mores desert is what foodie dreams are made of..... My husband ordered a green olive Gorgonzola martini and said it was one of the best he's had - my roasted chicken (even with a bone) was beyond tasty.... Risotto was perfect and I can't wait to go back. We left and the place was jamming, so I think Charlotte has a new top-choice in uptown. We'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"One of the nicest places in Uptown that doesn't act like it's some exclusive place. They change the menu frequently so everything is fresh and the drink options are great. The atmosphere is unique and I enjoyed hosting a group function here last December."}
{"text":"I am solely basing my review from trying to receive information for an event I am planning. I have not eaten here, but since I can't even get feedback (i.e. call or email) to receive pricing, etc. then I definitely don't want to waste my money and time here. TOO BAD , TOO SAD, sure the event coordinator is just that busy they don't care. Or maybe , I should stop in and ask? I think not, time is precious and you disappoint me 5Church. 2 weeks now and nothing.  I personally had the event coordinator contact me to figure out how my inquiry was missed, and was given great details. This is a beautiful establishment so it will be nice to have an event here. Thank you"}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner last night and we were disappointed about the food and service. Dishes flavourless. Our food came before our drinks. The busboy stole my plates before I was done eating. So I don't recommend to eat here at least during restaurant week."}
{"text":"The food was good it just needed some seasoning. The brunch bread was really tasty and the mimosas were good but tbh the price doesn't match the quality of the food. Service was nice!"}
{"text":"I tried this place when it was brand new. The food was awesome. We did the chefs tasting menu which was very good. Large wine list. Open and loud atmosphere. Didn't bug me. Staff was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Trendy/ritzy little place! I was impressed with the attention to detail in the decor. Large wine list and I've heard their cocktails are really good too. We called ahead and put our name in and they said they were on a 30 min wait. By the time we got to the restaurant, they were ready for us and we were seated right away.   We ordered the calamari for an appetizer, and our server recommended the pork belly spring rolls. I thought the calamari was a decent size (sharable between 5 people with another appetizer), but there were only 4 spring rolls so I'm confused on why our server recommended them to our group of 5 people. Neither of the appetizers were especially good or memorable to me.   For my entree, I had the petite filet with bomb.com mashed potatoes, and the Gorgonzola sauce. My date had the crab cakes. Our friends had the scallops, bolognese, and the 60 sec. steak. My steak was great, but I think it was more medium rare than medium (I ordered medium). I don't like sending anything back and I don't mind medium rare either so I happily had my steak. The Gorgonzola sauce is not your typical steak sauce but I really enjoyed it.   We also ordered three desserts: the coconut lime mousse, espresso mouse, and red velvet cake. The table overall enjoyed the red velvet cake the most, but I was obsessed with the espresso mousse!! So good... Our server was great but not anything memorable through the entire meal. I had a very nice night out with friends with some good food!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice. However, the steak was a joke. I ordered the seared steak which might as well been a TV dinner piece of Salisbury steak. If the steak was a 1/2\" thick that would be a stretch. Also, the steak was about 4 \"s long. Next, there wasn't a seared mark on the steak. To top it off, the plate came with my steak and spinach and zero presentation. It looked like a serving from a school cafeteria. To think they wanted over $30 for this. Do yourself a favor and have drinks and go it somewhere else to eat. It was an embarrassment to take 7 colleagues there."}
{"text":"Had a perfect wedding reception at 5Church! The service, food and ambiance were all amazing. Special shoutout to Alexa for making out wedding reception great!"}
{"text":"Alright Church-goers, there's been some changes. Bottom line, I still like it. And I see many reviews about the new menus and prices already.   The ten dollar lunch menu was the best. Now the lunch menus don't come with a free drink. And they all have different price. The smoked turkey sandwich for example,  got bigger and less greasy. The fries are less salty too. So it might better suit some people. I liked it too. But I would say I liked the old deal better.  The service still rocks. Genna (?) was awesome. We were wondering if it was in Fourth ward. She wasn't sure so she looked it up and came back with an answer even though we said nevermind.  I'll still go for lunch every week."}
{"text":"Good food and upbeat crowd made for a fun evening. Very interesting decor(check out the ceiling,a complete copy of \"The Art of War\".  We had fish, my swordfish (the special with heavy dumplings) was a little dry, but my husbands trout was delicious. I'd definitely give them another try!"}
{"text":"My initial thought after visiting 5Church is that it is a very nice restaurant in Uptown Charlotte.  The menu offerings are creative, the specialty cocktails and wine list are decently priced and very modern, and the ambiance of the restaurant is unique and trendy.    We were with a larger group so we all were able to try a variety of appetizers and dishes.  The crab cakes and bacon pizza were delicious, however the gnocchi was a little weird and had some sort of indistinguishable meat thrown in as a \"Chef's Choice\"...which we all know means whatever they had left over from the night before.   The tomato soup was very very salty but the black bean was delicious.  The gin fizz cocktail is very interesting, however the spirit and wine selection was plentiful and had something for everyone.  For our entrees, I had the duck breast.  It was well cooked, mildly seasoned, and everything you would expect for a nice duck breast...nothing more and nothing less.  I also was able to try the lamb burger which was good.  A friend of mine ordered the Kobe flatiron steak and we were all surprised after tasting how poor quality the cut of meat was.  Kobe beef is supposed to be one of the best cuts of steak you can find...and the one he received for his entrees was about as a chewy as a stick of Trident gum.   The server was very accommodating and brought out the 60 second strip steak.  For the rare steak lovers, I highly recommend ordering this if you ever stop by 5Church. It is one of the most unique preparations of steak I've ever tried.  Heavily seasoned and seared on one side while being almost completely rare on the other.  It was an excellent cut of steak and definitely the signature dish of 5Church.   Overall, 5Church was a pleasant dining experience with a unique atmosphere and friendly staff.  It was not particularly memorable but had solid menu choices if you happen to stop by.  I wouldn't recommend it as a top place to visit while you are in the area considering the price points and other surrounding restaurants."}
{"text":"Fabulous atmosphere - very fun and funky. Food is great (chickpea salad is yummy!). Our service left a little to be desired. The waitress was a little absent-minded. Would I go again? Hell yea, but I'd look for a different server."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant uptown. Rather going for brunch or dinner it's never a let down. For dinner the mouth watering filet is an excellent choice. They have the best selection of cocktails around. My personal favorite was the Ready Orgreat, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant worth it in Charlotte! From the food, decor to service, everything is great! I've only been there for dinner and brunch, but they have recently opened for lunch, which I cannot wait to try! Dinner has always been great, the duck and the smoked and roasted salmon are some of the best dishes! The sangria at brunch is also great, can't beat the $15 endless sangria! Definitely one of my new favorite places in Charlotte, and it takes a lot to impress me!"}
{"text":"Run don't walk for the Lamb Burger! I'm told it's on all 4 of their menus and it was delicious!  Only 3 stars because my husband was not so thrilled with his steak dinner. The pork belly fried rolls were good, the cheese plate did not impress."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a unique vibe. We went here for a date night and were thrilled with the service, food and even the drink specials. The food was delicious, our favorite being the Ahi Tuna Poke. My only caveat with 5Church is the seating arrangements. If you do not request a seat either off to the side or in a quiet area you are thrown by the front door or in the middle of a very loud space. Wanting to go here for a romantic dinner this was unfortunate but we have learned and next time ask for the appropriate seat ahead of time. Although this place is very trendy I would highly suggest not bringing the entire family. It is not the most child friendly environment with the large bar and upscale clientele."}
{"text":"Friendly waitstaff, although all the tattos really give the place a sort of vibe that i was not expecting. Definitely overpriced, but if you're looking for divorcees..this is the place!"}
{"text":"I came here for a drink and some appetizers one night.  The drink was good, but a little pricey, ok everything is a little pricey-but I guess you pay for the area.  The appetizers were tasty and satisfying.    The hostess was ok, not overly friendly.  The bar staff was nice.  The restaurant is beautiful inside.  It is a very open space, and trendy atmosphere.  I went during the week and so it wasn't overly crowded.    I would come back to try dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. We have been here a few time for drinks. Always a fun environment, but this was our first time eating there. We got the cheese board and ahi tuna for starters. Great dishes and excellent cheese selections. Most of us got the duck at the table which was very good. One friend got the octopus  and said it was the best cooked she has had, but very spicy and no indication on the menu that it was spicy. Only issue I had were the cocktails. The service was excellent, but the cocktails had too much ice and very little liquid. Overall very good experience."}
{"text":"I have to say, I am sad to even write this, as I used to enjoy this restaurant. However during my past two trips here, I have been thoroughly disappointed.   Most recently was at brunch this past weekend. We were sat a little after 12:30, and did not receive our food until 2pm. Our drinks at the table were empty and our waitress was scarce. When our food came, no one had a \"hot\" meal, and there was no check in on how we were doing after our meals arrived. After our meals arrived, we ordered other drinks and they weren't delivered until we had finished our plates.   I'd like to say that it was just our table, but you could see there were other tables there just as long, and just as impatiently waiting for everything.  However there were also tables receiving their food quickly and had attentive service. At best, the service just seemed spotty throughout the restaurant.   I'm sad to say that my group has taken 5Church off the list."}
{"text":"Love the one in Charleston and the original isn't bad either. Friendly, attentive staff and food was delicious. Crab cakes and eggs as well as corned beef and root vegetables were both fantastic. No booze until noon was a bit of a surprise but still a nice brunch spot!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant, with really unique décor.  I loved the ceiling!  The server we had (I believe his name was Hack) was awesome.  He was knowledgeable and attentive.  He was also very respectful and professional, which I cannot say about the other servers.  For example, I had to use the restroom during the meal, so I excused myself.  On the way to the restroom, at least 3 different servers walked in front of my path, not giving me the right-of-way.  Then on the way back, another 2 servers (one of the same ones as before) did the exact same thing.  I am not talking about needing my path cleared completely, but rather, they stepped in front of me, knowing that I was walking with them.  I know this sounds petty, but the fact that 4 different servers did this makes me feel that professionalism and customer service are not a priority at this restaurant.  For the food, I had the bistro steak.  It was cooked perfectly, but not seasoned the greatest.  The mashed potatoes were dry and lacking flavor - certainly nothing special.  The béarnaise sauce sat for too long and was too cold.  My wife asked for a peppercorn sauce to accompany her steak, knowing that it was off-menu, she didn't have any expectations.  However, what she received was just another sauce off of their menu, which was basically Worcestershire and ketchup - tasted fine, just nothing special and certainly not peppercorn.  She did not receive an explanation that they couldn't make another sauce.  Overall, this place is just OK.  It has it's highs and lows.  It was overpriced for what you received - definitely a place that is trying to be more than it apparently has the ability to do.  I really wanted to like this place, and I think the ratings the restaurant has received (about 3.5 stars) is about where it should be, if not a little lower, which is why I ranked it a 3.  I do not plan on going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious. Fast, informed, friendly service. Cool, energetic space that wasn't too loud. Great location."}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte to have dinner with friends.  Good location great drink selection broad selection of appetizers and entrees.  Gets busy quick on Saturday eve."}
{"text":"I've heard some decent things about 5Church's food but have heard awful things about their service. We decided to pop in here on St. Patrick's day as it seemed to be the only place without an exhaustingly long line. However upon getting inside, realized the bar was grossly understaffed and was getting orders incorrect left and right. I ordered 5 Irish car bombs and was informed that they were OUT OF GUINNESS. I've never heard of a bar running out of Guinness on St Patrick's day but the bartender told me he could substitute a local porter instead. I was charged for 5 \"seasonal draft beers\" and Jameson shots which last I checked was NOT an Irish car bomb. As a result my tab was $60! I was expecting to pay slightly more than usual on this day but we later found out that every other bar was doing $7-8 Irish car bombs so it was a complete waste of my money. This review is due to the lack of transparency in pricing and completely terrible service for drinks (I can't speak for the food quality). Obviously will never return to 5Church again."}
{"text":"I think I may have eaten too much which may have led to this rating, I would probably give 5Church around 3.5 stars  The night started off pretty well, we got a call around 5:00 PM to confirm our 7:00 PM reservation. One problem, they failed to mention that there was no valet parking that night so we left our house with the plan of arriving right around 6:55 PM. When there were shut down streets in downtown Charlotte and no valet person in sight, it made for a bad start to the evening.   Once we parked and got inside, the ambiance in there is excellent, definitely feels hip with nice wall murals and the Art of War written on the ceiling. The food overall was good, but not great and I felt our bill was a little high for what we ended up eating. We were at Soul Gastrolounge last weekend which I felt was a MUCH better value for the amount of food you get.  Appetizers Pork Belly - AWESOME, small portion, but just enough to wet your appetite Beet Sliders - Also well done, wouldn't have expected them to be good, but quite surprised Jerk Chicken Lettuce Warps - Also very very good Perogies - Not my favorite, was expecting better based on past reviews, but I felt these were disappointing.  Entree 60 second NY steak -unique flavor, texture that change throughout the cut. Never had anything quite like it before and would recommend it if you are a fan of NY steak. Be warned, most parts are VERY rare, but it is juicy and flavorful  Dessert Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake - was expecting better based on waiter recommendation, i would say it is slightly above average  Overall, 5Church is worth visiting once, but I don't think I will go back given the limited number of date nights that my wife and I can take with 2 kids. GIven the chance, we would go back to Soul Gastrolounge in a heartbeat before 5Church!"}
{"text":"My family went for Mothers Day Brunch. Everything was exceptional. We were greeted at the door with a very pleasant hostes. Our server was great and the buffet was always stocked with fresh seafood. Everything was hot or cold depending on the food. Best part... although it was packed you could carry on a conversation. Whatever your doing Nick...keep it up. We will be back."}
{"text":"went here to grab drinks and small plates with friends  i got the tomato salad which came with a crostini with an olive spread- good! also got the black bean hummus which came with yummy chips  good service and good ambiance! would go again to grab drinks"}
{"text":"Our waitress did not pay attention to us for the first 15 minutes we were there, and rarely came to check on us afterward. Then, we had to ask her to take our order since she kept walking past us and ignoring us. Our water glasses had lipstick on them from the previous party. One of the members of our party ordered a Bloody Mary when we first arrived and it didn't come to the table until after the food was delivered, and after we had to remind the waitress about the drink. (And it was an awful Bloody Mary). We ordered 3 coffees that were in small cups that you could finish after 3 sips, no refills, and $5 each...for a black coffee. I could have ordered a large specialized drink from Starbucks for that price. Our food and coffee were both luke warm by the time it got to our table. All in all, we were not happy with our experience, would not suggest others to eat here, and would not try this restaurant again.   But the restaurant was clean, so I'll give it 2 stars."}
{"text":"I came here with coworkers for lunch. I ordered the Reuben with fries and it was delicious. This was my first visit but others had been here before and they were not satisfied with the pasta of the day and a salad with chicken.   I had heard great things about this place for dinner so I look forward to coming back and trying the dinner menu."}
{"text":"My current favorite lunch spot uptown. The lamb burger was amazing, the new $10 lunch specials are excellent and their fries are the best in town.   The decor can best be described as funky. Graffitti'd ceiling, angel wing lamps over the bar, cool art. I've yet to check out the dinner scene and from what I've heard, scene is an appropriate term. I've stuck to lunch and have been consistently happy.  Their sandwiches are nicely constructed, tasty, buttery and good. My friend and I split the grilled prosciutto/mozzarella sandwich and the smoked turkey sandwich. Neither of us would give up the other half of our sandwich without protest. And the fries. Yum. Crispy, salty, flavorful and as good as a fry gets.   The service was prompt and efficient, it's a place worth going back.  We plan to keep going back."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant last night for our anniversary dinner expecting great things due to some wonderful reviews and friends recommendations.  Service was excellent! Many many servers and assistants constantly flowing around the area.   Ambiance  was really cool. Loved the feather lampshades over the bar, very interesting light fixtures through out the restaurant, and the overall feel was very clubby. It was far too loud in the lower level where we were seated, but perhaps the upstairs area would be different? If we return, I will have to ask to be seated there. I had to ask the waitress to repeat herself many times because to the noise level, and I have great hearing!  Wonderful people watching.   The food was only ok.   The bread basket included two pieces of warm bread. I appreciated warmed bread. The butter was soft but whipped and not salted. I prefer salted.  It was a restaurant week, and I liked the options listed so ordered one of their pre-selected three course combinations. I started off with  the black bean hummus which was very salty with fried wonton strips. Blah. Next was the wasabi crusted salmon and I exchanged the side accompaniments for the mashed potatoes and glazed vegetables. The presentation was nice, but very few vegetables were on the plate (2 pieces of broccoli). The mashed potatoes with gravy were delicious and the best part of the entire meal.   I really liked the fact they offered a 3 course wine pairing and it was very reasonably priced at on $15.  I only wanted one glass for the meal so I ordered the recommended pinot noir and it was excellent.  Hubby ordered a bunch of different \"first courses\" and \"snacks.\"  He started with the warm tomato soup which had a lovely presentation with a toasted cheese crouton laying across the top of the bowl. It was served straight on the table, no plate under the bowl. Hmmmm.  His verdict, bland. He ordered the truffled mushroom pierogies (fried & tasty!), the tiny beet slider (we definitely prefer 131 Main's beet slider), crisp pork belly,  and jerk chicken lettuce wraps. It was fun having all these appetizer size dishes show up and tasty and nibble the different flavors. Nothing was outstanding though.  The restaurant week menu included a dessert and I ordered the s'mores option. It was terrible. The server offered to box up the dessert, so she did notice that I did not eat more than 2 bites. When I said \"no thanks,\" she did not investigate  why I didn't eat it. Hubby thought it was pretty awful too.  The server took our valet parking receipt out and the car was waiting for us when we walked out.  This was wonderful.  Service is excellent, food is poor.  No plans to return."}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time I am there the food is amazing and the staff is friendly. The atmosphere is great and don't think dinner is the only thing as Sunday brunch is to die for!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for drinks and appetizers one evening when in Charlotte for a wedding. The interior is really beautiful, very well decorated. We bellied up to the bar and asked the bartender what would be quick food wise and ordered a couple drinks. The bartender seemed harried and gave us a couple suggestions.  We ordered the black bean hummus, yuck, it's really bad. I think we didn't look at the description clearly, we just saw hummus so we ordered it. Hummus shouldn't be made from black beans. Very bland, we didn't eat it, to their credit they took it off our bill.   I had a wedge salad, which was fine, the lettuce was crisp, flavors tasty.   We had to catch our server multiple times to ask for silverware, napkins etc. I think they were just generally overwhelmed but I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"Great service and nice atmosphere but the food is major lacking in flavor. My salad was so heavily dressed with balsamic drizzle that it overpowered the rest of the salad. My short-ribs were falling off the bone but had very little flavor, I just couldn't finish it, and I  rarely don't finish a meal.  UPDATE: I got a nasty message on yelp from an employee. Please don't patronize this restaurant. I now changed my star rating."}
{"text":"Visited 5 Church for the first time with friends after Googling then Yelping for a spot that made artisan style cocktails with egg yolks. Yes I said egg yolks! . I like to think of myself as a Whiskey  connoisseur and having just moved from NYC I've had it tons of ways and with an egg yolk was my favorite. This adds a smooth element that sits well with my palette so I recommend anyone who loves whiskey (Makers is my fav) to try it.  Ok back to 5 Church! So I asked if they could make an herbal infused Whiskey with an egg yolk. They didn't have all the ingredients that I needed so we went with what they had. The cocktail was over powered by this liquid cilantro and rosemary I believe. They get an \"E\" for effort.   Because we were there to drink so gave them a second chance and ordered a Makers on the rocks with an egg yolk which then tasted like dish water or what I assume it would taste like lol.  Anyway, the Maine Lobster appetizer was great and my friend ordered a Gin Gimlet that was amazing. So to sum this up, crafted drinks bad and basic cocktails good lol.  I'll come back to try their brunch."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night, the place was crowded but we had already made reservation by calling beforehand. The table was not ready when we got there so we had to wait for another 10 -15 minutes but I didn't mind because the waiting couch is very comfortable and it was raining outside. You can also order drinks while you are waiting.  To start with, I got a glass of wine, which I was able to sample before getting the full glass. My friend got the bourbon drink, which was delicious- great raspberry flavor but I could barely taste the alcohol. The New-Fashion drink was interesting- rim of the glass was coated with nuts and the alcohol content was good. I recommend trying it if you are a bourbon fan.   For the appetizer, we got the cheese plate ($16). It was delicious and good portion size for two people. We tried sharing between 4 of us and it wasn't enough.   For the entrée, I got the lamb burger ($14), one of the best ones I have had. It comes with a side of fries. The burger might not look enough at first sight but it will fill you up before you know it. My friend got the steak but according to her, the sauce it came with tasted like a BBQ sauce and it wasn't the best.  It's a good place for a date night or a fancy dinner with friends. It's a bit expensive because you are paying for the decor and the ambience. For me, it's a one-time place."}
{"text":"Honestly the best restaurant I've had in Charlotte. The atmosphere reminds me of a night out in Manhattan and the cocktails were great. We ordered the filet and it was also amazing. Also try the pesto flatbread. We loved the app so much we ordered 2."}
{"text":"First and probably last time I'll probably go here. We came for lunch on Valentine's Day and we were super disappointed.  Honesty the food wasn't bad, not memorable, but not bad. I had the lamb burger and my husband had the polenta and shrimp, their play on shrimp and grits I guess.  Let's start with service, it blew. I basically felt we were forgotten. I think because we don't drink and just wanted water the waitress was annoyed. Everybody else got banana bread to start and we just sat with nothing. She eventually gave us the banana bread when we were done with our meal. We had to send the shrimp and polenta back because it was cold, probably cause it took 30 minutes after we ordered to get our food. It was just overall a disappointment especially since we were excited to go."}
{"text":"This place is designed to the nines ... or designed within an inch of its life. It's certainly very striking, what with \"The Art of War\" by Sun Tzu written out by hand on the ceiling and all of the art and trimmings. We went with the prix fixe menu ($40 + the wine pairing for another $15) to get a good sampling of 5Church's wares. Shot the shit with a very genial and good-natured barkeep, who handled us well.   The food was ... fine. My steak was fantastic, but everything else was just kind of fine. Too many things going on with the desserts and the sides were a little paltry, but the food was fine.  Their cocktail menu could be better. The ones the bartender made were totally fine, and appeared as they were advertised in the menu, but 5Church would definitely benefit from cocktail consultants coming in and developing on a small but tight cocktail program. 5Church also needs to overhaul their spirits selection a bit, too. It's dated. Better to have a really nice (refrigerated) vermouth than 9 trillion different kinds of flavored vodka. I know,  I know: \"Give the people what they want.\" But trust me, sometimes it works to everyone's advantage when you offer people something they didn't know they wanted. They'll pay for it. 5Church is styled well (and still young) -- it is positioned well for becoming the one place in Charlotte that's really good for mixed cocktails."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times now. Food has been excellent. I've had steak, pork chop and lamb burger, all have been cooked perfectly. Nice space, good service, what more could I ask?"}
{"text":"The newest coolest joint in town! From the minute you step in to the restaurant, it's as if you've been transported out of Charlotte.. 5Church is comparable to any happening restaurant in a big city like New York or San Fran! Everything from the ambiance (take a look at the ceiling when you're there) to the service to the food was phenomenal. 5Church has the right amount of classiness without being pretentious. It is a tad bit pricey, but the food is well worth it. Don't miss out on the pork belly for appetizers and the lamb burger for the main course. Their cocktail list is impressive; if you're craving something sweet and refreshing try '5 church' it's a lychee based vodka drink. Their complimentary Gorgonzola bread is so amazing, I would go back just for that!  I think I have a new favorite restaurant :)"}
{"text":"5Church is a great place to meet with friends after work and have a smashing good time.  I definitely recommend for people to stop by this place for drinks and dinner after work.  This is snuggled in the corner of 5th Street and Church.  Unfortunately, the address has that this place is on North Tryon.  I'm going to pull the girl card and say that I'm bad with directions and had a terrible time finding this place.  But then again...the name is5Church, so that should have told me something.  I guess I'm not the brightest crayon in the box.  Anywho, when you see this place, it looks pretty swanky cool from the outside looking in with their big glass windows so you can observe people walking outside, or just look at the cars passing by.  Inside is really great as the place is decorated in a modern way.  They have nice hostesses to greet you as soon as you walk in and take you to a table.  I ended up at the table in the middle of the place where it can seat a big party, but I think they seat other people not from your party there too to fill up the room.  It was cool, but I didn't like how it was very close to the bar.  If you happen to tilt your head back drinking, you'll get to see that the ceiling is black with words written all over in white.  I thought that was a fun detail to notice.  The food was pretty good, but I felt that it did take a long time for us to receive our appetizers and entree.  I had ordered the tomato soup and thought it was just delightful!  For my entree, I had the scallops with leek potatoes.  It was good, but a little too salty for me.  All in all, good experience.  I'm sure I'll find myself there again sometime soon."}
{"text":"I didn't experience anything that would make me rush to come back or even come back at all. Kinda like, I now can say I've been. I came for a bookclub meeting and chose from what I'm guessing was their brunch menu. Had the lamb burger. It was ok. The fries were noteworthy.  Think I ate more of those than the burger. I did enjoy the dessert platter. Especially the salted caramel bar. They were bite sized portions so I didn't feel I got all I wanted but since I wasn't paying, I didn't complain. I guess it's a nice, trendy space just not my kind of chill spot. Perhaps I'm telling my age..."}
{"text":"finally had a chance to bring a group of coworkers here and thank god i did. 5church is clearly the coolest restaurant in charlotte (which isnt saying alot) but nevertheless a very cool interior, decent atmosphere and the  food was pretty good. i had the duck (on duck) ala mole , which i remember enjoying. drinks were strong and my group had a ton of fun. Service was on point and valet's were efficient. Strong BUY"}
{"text":"What a great brunch experience! Loved the BOTTOMLESS mimosas on Sundays (After Noon due to NC Law) for $12. I had the crab cakes and poached egg - it was fresh, flavorful, and despite not being enormous, was plenty filling. My husband had the steak and eggs, with fries, and it was great too. Not sure what they do with their fries, but they were delicious! The ceiling has this unique writing on it - it's like matte black and then someone spent unimaginable hours writing unique phrases all over the ceiling. Adds a nice (but upscale still) eclectic flair. We enjoyed it and our server \"Doug\" was always on point."}
{"text":"To say I was disappointed would be a major understatement. Had heard really good things about this place and so we were very excited to try it during Restaurant Week for date night....so here you go.   1. Made reservations for 2 at 8:00 on a Tuesday and waited at the bar for 20 minutes - which for the most part was fine as I mentioned...it was Restaurant Week, so no big deal. Took a really long time to have any one ask for a drink order even though there were less than 20 people at the bar and three bartenders and no one waiting for drinks....except me. Decent selection of beers, but initial impression on service and table turn (on time reservation) not good. 2. Got drinks and seated at our table. Great table - kind of right in the middle of the restaurant and great location to watch people - very happy with this. Grace was our server and she was very nice and came to the table right away for water and to explain the menus, etc. Ten minutes later, she was back to take our order. We ordered off the Restaurant Week menus which had quite a few choices - very happy with that.  3. Waited for at least 10 minutes for more beers and another 10 minutes for appetizers. Wife's salad was ok and my shrimp and octopus cerviche was pretty good. The bread wafers and humus were also very tasty. Service at this point was hit and miss and even though Grace had other tables in the area we were seeing less and less of her - a very bad sign as it turns out.  4. People coming and going but by now 9:15, the restaurant is really emptying out, but we still haven't gotten our entree - an hour after we were seated for our 8:00 reservation, still no entrees AND no explanation / apologies for the long wait....in fact, Grace is missing in action. She finally comes by to let us know the kitchen is plating our entrees and they should be right out. Entrees come out and everything looks good (filet / brussel sprouts / potatoes & hangar steak / potatoes and corn salsa) VERY good, in fact. But, one bite of my steak and I pretty much knew my entree had not been \"plated\" any time in the last 15 minutes...not hot, not warm, but room temperature - at best. Cooked properly, but virtually tepid. After sitting there for the better part of 90 minutes. The brussel sprouts turned out to be one brussel sprout hiding under the filet...did I mention it was Restaurant Week?  5. Both of us ate most of our coldish meal and ordered dessert. Desserts were pretty good - smores trifle and caramel pretzel bar. Caramel pretzel bar was still pretty much frozen in the middle so it next to impossible to cut and eat...smores trifle was really pretty good. However, we had to wait for another 10 minutes for the dessert to come out even though we ordered it when they finally delivered the entrees.  6. After 1 hour and 45 minutes, we were finally ready for the check which I asked for when the dessert was delivered and when the check was brought to the table, I  discovered that I had been charged $14 (yes, $14 for two beers) that I paid for with cash at the bar while we were waiting 15 minutes for our 8:00 reservation. Simple mistake...no problem. Grace would get it taken care of with the manager which she did 10 minutes later when they both came to the table to apologize (very nice) but had to run my card AGAIN - which took another 5 minutes or longer.   All in all, food was tolerable albeit on the cooler side, Grace started out great, but lost major points for not being attentive and never apologizing for the glacial speed of food coming out of the kitchen - she was very nice and very helpful with some additional beer selections and I never needed to wait for tea refills, but over two hours for dinner on a Tuesday night (during Restaurant Week or not) is a bit excessive.   I almost always tip at least 20 % especially at nice restaurants (which this is) and I realize Grace was not able to speed the kitchen up and get food out faster, but in a restaurant that regularly charges up to $30 for an entree during regular weeks (not Restaurant Weeks) I expect considerably more attention and some sort of apology or comp a beer or bring me some more humus or......anything to make me feel like they were trying to make me happy or actually care about my time or enjoyment. I ended up tipping Grace over 20% because (again) it was Restaurant Week and I don't think the food thing was her fault, but she also dropped the ball big time being inattentive.   Restaurant Week or not, this was the only time I will going to 5Church which is too bad because I really wanted to like the place, but I didn't."}
{"text":"The vibe at 5Church is awesome. I loved the look of the whole restaurant. I ate the gnocchi appetizer. It was different for gnocchi but still very good. For my entree I had the grouper. It was very good. The person I was with had the scallops and seemed to really like them. I definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Man oh man I really like the The hot CAB corned beef dish.  The eggs were perfectly poached and even the spinach had a great taste to it and it wall blended together nicely."}
{"text":"I went here late night with some friends while in town for a bridal shower/bachelorette. very cool hip ambiance with classy decor. The cocktails were excellent. The New Fashioned is one of the best I've ever had. and the smores trifle?!?! AMAZING. I seriously was sad when I finished this dessert. I do not typically like very rich chocolate things but the marshmallow cream on top was a great touch. Will definitely return when visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"I only went for drinks. Loved the decor. Such a fun group seating area upstairs. Very trendy and beautiful. Quotes written on the ceiling. Moscow mules and yummy shots.  Can't wait up come back to try the food."}
{"text":"Brunch Here!  I've been the 5 Church a number of times and it's a great place. It has a super bar. They also have a great menu.   That said I've never considered it for brunch and that was a mistake! Great brunch; that is - good food, well priced libations and a super ambiance (check out the ceiling!). I had the steak and eggs and it was five-stars! The croque-Madame looked as good!  We were looked after by Grace today, who would be any restaurants perfect true asset. (July 16, 2016). Thanks Grace!   I'm going back and soon"}
{"text":"Occasion was an organizational End of Year event, small/medium-sized group (13).  Enjoyed a very nice dinner, Wasabi-crusted Salmon was excellent.  Drink, The Viper, was fantastic, service was great - even turned our corner speaker off when we inquired.  So why only 3-stars?  Place obviously caters to the young professional crowd, which I am not.  Lastly, it is very loud (even with our speaker off, it was tough to hold a conversation)."}
{"text":"If there is such thing as Restaurant Heaven, it can be found at 5 Church.  The decor is gothic beauty.  I especially love the winged light fixtures at the bar. We were seated immediately although we had no reservations.  Our sever was upbeat, professional, and on it!  Plus, other servers were diligent about keeping our table free of finished plates and glasses. My man and I ordered the mussels, creamed spinach, and a cheese plate.  Although the mussels were the tiniest we ever saw, they had the most delectable garlic wine cream sauce.  The cheese plate featured yummy cheese, tapenade, chutney, bread, olives and peppers.  The spinach was a nice addition to the other two plates.  So good that even though I just ate dinner at home an hour ago, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. 5 Church, I look forward to walking through your pearly gates again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots in charlotte. The food is always good and the mimosas specials make for the perfect brunch. Every time I visit the city I'm sure to come here."}
{"text":"Great eclectic mix in uptown for dinner or we even like it for a pre-game brunch before the Panthers game.  Try the biscuits and heavy, the biscuit is GYNORMOUS!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town for the weekend, so we made a res for 5Church based on the location and Yelp reviews. We were instantly impressed with the rock star glam digs - there was a lot to take in, including writing covering the ceiling and funky light fixtures. We started with the Bourberry and Wild Berry Mojito, which were both yummy and we easily could have guzzled even before our bread arrived. The first dish we were excited to try was the Price Edward Island Mussels, one of our favorite starters. Unfortunately, after tasting a few, we both looked at each other in disgust because they tasted extremely fishy and... just \"off.\" We informed our server that they must be a bad batch, to which she kindly offered a replacement starter. We instead decided to proceed to our mains, the Lamb Burger and Herb-brined and Roasted Chicken. Both were full of flavor and good portions... the restaurant definitely redeemed itself. My chicken was perfectly cooked - very tender and juicy. While we were eating, the manager even came over and apologized profusely for the mussels, which he maintains are always fresh. He even gave us a complimentary dessert, the smores trifle, which was heeeeavenly. All in all, 5Church is definitely worth visiting. We would totally return!"}
{"text":"This review is for a Sunday brunch. Upon entering restaurant the smell of a dirty damp cloth was immediate but we decided to stay despite the foul odor. Our server was pleasant and didn't harass us when we took our time to order. Food arrived and was attractively presented but my scrambled eggs were cold, as was my side of sautéed spinach although they both were cooked and seasoned well. Mimosa was very light on the bubbly and I'm fairly certain I could have drank six of them and still walked out without stumbling. All in all, I was thoroughly disappointed.  Perhaps they were having an off day, but I'm not sure I'll bother giving it a second chance. Very stylish and trendy place, however."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to 5 church to actually eat except for a yelp event last year.  I was pretty impressed with the service, the food and the ambiance.    Food:  I actually wasn't THAT impressed with the menu options.  I mean they had a couple things to choose from but nothing stood out as unique and nothing tempted me.  They have steaks, a chicken dish, salmon but so what.  So, we decided to just order a bunch of appetizers and sides to enjoy a variety from the menu.  We started with the black bean hummus and fried calamari and both were very good.  The hummus was a pretty good size portion considering it was only $4 and it was served with yummy flat bread/chips.  The calamari was very good--not too much breading, not too chewy, fresh, crispy, etc.  It was served with some type of spicy dipping sauce that was different than anything I have had before but also very good.  Next we went with the bacon pizza and a side of broccoli (random I know).  The pizza was so good.  Thin crust doesn't even describe it...it was more like no crust but it was still very tasty.  The cheese was just enough and the bacon pieces were plump and crispy.  It came out piping hot.  The broccoli was supposed to be family-size but it was more like small child size.  However, the broccoli was marinated in garlic and olive oil and it was cooked to perfection.  I mean my breath was hot for 2 days after due to the amount of garlic but it was worth it!  The drink menu was plentiful but the prices were a bit high.  They offered very few glasses of wine but they had plenty of other beers, cocktails, etc.  Service:  The service was very good by way of attentiveness.  I wouldn't say the crew was the most professional or polished in their approach but there were pretty available and efficient when needed and overall very friendly.    Ambiance:  Such a cool looking restaurant.  I love how they decorated it....it has a gothic, chic, trendy feel.  It is just gorgeous.  The nightlife scene is pretty hopping after the dinner hours.  It has a more mature crowd I would say overall but quite a few young professionals.    Good food, nice atmosphere.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Greattttttt food. Greatttttttt drinks. Oh snap! Is that the dude I saw on Tinder??? Well then *stare* lol 5church has great lamb burger if I must say so myself. Wayyy better experience than last year. Waitress was attentive so that's great. Love the layout of the restaurant. Restroom was kind of weird. Like narrow feeling.  It's a very chic place. Different. New-american kind of dishes.  Great place to go on a date or chill with friends :)"}
{"text":"Loved the decor of this place, especially with \"The Art of War\" written on the ceiling.  The food tried very hard to be good but it just fell a little flat.  We had the romaine salad which would have been good if they didn't put too much balsamic on it and then try to cover it up with more bleu cheese and bacon.  However, I did appreciate their splitting it up into equal sized portions for the two of us.  Next, we had the mussels which were very creamy and came with charred bread.  Lastly, we shared the grouper, which was cooked perfectly but lacked flavor.  Sadly, this restaurant did not deliver."}
{"text":"Attended a large dinner with some friends before wedding festivities. First off, I LOVED the space. It was very hip and modern.  I ordered the Scallops and they were some of the best Scallops that I have ever had. We also tried many appetizers, and I didnt hear any complaints about any of them.   I would return time and time again when in Charlotte to get the scallops!"}
{"text":"Walked in like a boss! Felt like one too! The atmosphere at \"5Church\" is like no other in the City of Charlotte and the writing is on the wall literally. The layout/space at \"5Church\" took sometime to plan out and you can tell. There's areas to have a special nice dinners, area's to lounge with friends, area's to meet new people and of course a bar that says drink here and feel like a yuppie in a upbeat urban area movie. Yes, the place can get a little loud but it's a restaurant for young people and we are loud naturally. Yes, the prices are a little higher but its not astonishing. When I was looking for a restaurant to choose for the special occasion (2yr anniversary dinner)(not married just together) I was thinking Sullivans but chose \"5church\" because the prices were moderately better. The service was pretty darn good if you ask me, everyone was polite and very knowledgeable of the menu. Our waiter knew exactly what was on the menu and how things should be prepared. I started the evening off with a Shrimp flat bread... man o' man was this good. My lady ate most of it and then was looking for more. The downfall here for me was the shrimp (it was cocktail shimp) I felt like at a place like this they should of used bigger prawns but who am I to judge because I did enjoy it. The flatbread had boursin cheese on it, I was trying my best to figure out what type of cheese this was the entire time because the waiter had taken our menu's by this time. It reminded me of cream cheese but you can tell it wasn't (it melted just right onto the flat bread). Now along with the cheese and shrimp there was red onions and arugula on the bread. Main Course Time:  I had the Grilled Hanger Steak (pictured above). The steak was very juicy and cooked just right. I hate Brussels spouts but as long as you serve them with this steak I'll eat them every day of the week. The potato risotto was a great touch as well. It was sort of like a fresh mashed potato with potato chunks in it. You can't see it in the pic above because its covered by the shallot jus. Altogether this was a damn good dish. My lady on the other hand had the Herb-Brined & roasted chicken. The Chicken was juicier than the steak. I love to brine my chicken so I have to give them 2 thumbs and 2 big toes up with this one. The mashed potatoes for this dish were, meh. I've had better, way better.  All together I would definitely be back here and if your in Charlotte you have to come by here. All of the who's who in Charlotte come here, I'm guessing because it's just that type of place. In no time I'm sure this will be the before club hangout spot in CLT! Great job 5church."}
{"text":"I've been to 5Church a couple of times, mainly for cocktails, but recently decided to stay and check out the dinner menu.  After arriving, without a reservation, we were told it would be an hour wait, no worries. We decided to  head to the bar and enjoy a cocktail or two, and the hostess said she would come grab us. After an hour and ten minutes I wondered why there were tables open and we had not been seated. After we checked with the hostess, we learned she had forgot us. That was definitely frustrating.  After browsing the menu, we decided to start with the pork belly spring rolls, which were pretty good. As for the entrees, we decided to order the 60 second steak and arctic char.  The steak was good, not my thing, but my date enjoyed it.  As for the char, it was good, but definitely lacking seasoning. I asked for salt, but never received it. We then decided to enjoy the chocolate caramel bar for dessert, pretty good. The crumble was amazing. Overall, I think 5Church is a great spot for a cocktail or two, but the service and food is just ok. Nothing I would remember or recommend someone must go to."}
{"text":"I was so underwhelmed by brunch at five church. The food was under seasoned and over cooked. I got the brunch burger; the egg was cooked so long it was rubbery and the burger, which I ordered medium rare, was completely burnt. Everyone in my party left half of their food on their plate and the waitress cleared the plates without question. Definitely not a place worth going to, definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"\"Not a problem\" - this is what our waitress said every time we said, \"thank you\" after she delivered an item for the table.  I hate that expression, especially when delivered from waitstaff.  Whatever.  Drinks fine, although out of rye for our Old Fashioneds.  Apps, tepid: duck confit pierogies, didn't have any detectible duck flavor, a dish called Jerk Chicken in a wrap of lettuce had no jerky flavor but the Shenzen Pork Belly app was good enough for us to order another.  Entrees: I had the lamb burger.  I ordered it medium.  It came rare and cold.  My wife ordered a fish - she seemed to like it.  My son ordered a version of spaghetti bolognese  - is was fine.  I was psyched for the visit but it just didn't excite.  Won't return.  jjc"}
{"text":"Restaurant week in Charlotte.  Great meal.  Pretzel desert was beyond belief.  Every once in awhile you get a wait person who is an example of how to do it.   Maghen is the personification of that waiter.  Thank you.  Hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"Went to 5 Church last week for lunch in between showing real estate with an out of state client. I've been to 5 Church before just for drinks this was my first time for food . My client has a bad case of acid reflux and was limited to what he could have from the menu. The manager got a wind of that she came by, and was extremely sympathetic to my client. They were so willing to work with my client that they prepared special dish for my him. This place has a great a atmosphere,food and customer service this is definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"If you're on a date, just get the filet with Gorgonzola dip, and the wasabi crusted salmon! That combination is the best meal I've had in Charlotte.   Atmosphere is awesome! Good music, good vibes."}
{"text":"(This review is for Sunday Brunch service)  Let me be honest. I didn't particularly like 5Church in my previous visits (ever since they first opened). I have had a big group birthday dinner here before. The service was nothing to write home about. I have had a Yelp event here (a long while back). I didn't think the food was particularly impressive, especially for the price. The only thing I ever recommend others to order here was the hanger steak. Hey, at least you get some substance for what you fork out and won't go starving afterward.  So why all of the sudden I'm a fan? Here is the prime example on how great service can turn a mediocre dining experience into a great one. My brunching friends picked 5Church yesterday, mostly because they have bottomless mimosa ($12; they also offer bottomless sangria for $10 but they were out of sangria). Plus they all live uptown, so this is walking distance and rarely has a wait on Sundays.   Unfortunately for me (who don't live uptown), I had to find parking. Peeps, keep an eye out for the Knights schedule. If they're having a Sunday afternoon home game, that means all the lots are at least $5, and half of on street meter spots are off limit. Somehow 4 loops later I got the blessing of the parking god and got a sweet on street spot on Trade.   I was the last one arriving. We were seated by the windows in the far right. Michelle (from NY) was our waitress. She was fabulous. In fact she earned the extra star for this review. It was her birthday, and she's working, and she's cheerful. She didn't strand us with empty mimosa glasses. (NOTHING pisses me off more than bottomless mimosa that leaves my glass empty more often than full).   The food... was ok. I had the make-your-own-omelete. For $8 I wouldn't complain. I picked shrimp, spinach & mushrooms as my 3 fillings. It came with home fries and toasts. Good portion; eggs were a little overcooked (not fluffy) but tasted ok. I also had a taste of the waffle which was very sweet and cake-y. 2 people ordered the oysters po-boy, which was very sizable as well. They did say that the bread was a little much to eat through so it became more of a open face sandwich for them.  But the positive and fun attitude Michelle brought to the table was priceless. It took her a second to figure out that we're just a bunch of mimosa drinking fools, and she did her part to keep the refreshing bubblies coming. She helped one of our friends to plug in his cell phone. She shared short stories about her hometown. THIS is how service should be.  Thus even though the food was \"just ok,\" because of the surprisingly affordable price and this oddly positive service experience, I'm giving 5Church a 4-star for their brunch."}
{"text":"I came here with a close friend and we weren't disappointed.   I ordered the potatoes Parmesan gnocchi with chicken and it was amazing! I loved the roasted butternut squash purée (and wish there was a bit more because it was so good)!  For dessert I ordered the s'mores trifle and this may have been one of my favorite desserts at a restaurant! The brownie was warm and mixed perfectly with the toasted marshmallow cream and graham cracker crumble! I would go back just to get this dessert!   My friend got the espresso frozen mousse for dessert and his looked just as good as mine and was gone before I finished my second glass of wine!  Highly recommend for a nicer dinner out"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I have never been in a restaurant so lovely in my life. The concept of the interior design is amazing.  A mix of a high end NYC spot, a nice nightclub, and a quirky modern eatery.  I couldn't stop staring at the decor,and don't miss the ceiling if you go here.....coolest thing ever.    Food:  we loved it.  Their lamb burger is the best burger we have ever tried....and the special secret sauce for the fries is the bomb. The grouper entree was tasty and very filling, and the caviar was an amazing touch.  We tried the cold asparagus appetizer and enjoyed it, as well as the shrimp flatbread appetizer, which we liked slightly better.  The Jeff Gordon wines were awesome as well.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"5Church is lovely! Lamb burger was juicy & delicious! Get this. Cocktails are excellent. Service was crazy fast & friendly--get this--on a SATURDAY night!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation and arrived 10 minutes early.  The hostess told us we would need to wait, so we happily went to the bar.  We waited a long time to be acknowledged and then finally ordered two glasses of wine and three glasses of water.  He brought us bottled water which we did not ask for and did not want to pay for. The pour was great but the bartender was offensive.  He called me \"darling\", made a similarly inappropriate comment to my daughter and was just smarmy throughout.  He had a smart comment about everything.  The place was loud and crowded.  We waited 1/2 hour and no one came to verify our reservation. I handed him my credit card and he returned the receipt and card to my husband.  Unbelievable!   We left.  Terrible customer service.  We went to Capitol Grille  and enjoyed great service and a great meal."}
{"text":"Do not order the 60 second steak!  Burnt on one side, uncooked on the other = disgusting.  As a reference, I always order my steak medium rare, and I did not enjoy this goofball way to prepare a steak one bit.  The chef is reaching too far to try to be trendy and creative, and failing miserably in this case.  Burnt steak is never good, why on earth would anyone think burning one side and cooking the other would be a good idea?  On the plus side, at least they didn't ruin a good price of meat, the steak was very tough to begin with.  A lot of people at our table ordered this steak because the waitress hyped it up so much, and everyone was disappointed in both the quality of the meat and the horrible preparation."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. Like loved loved loved it! We went here for dinner and were seated immediately. The setup is great, there's a bar downstairs and then a smaller one upstairs with the tables. While the food side of the menu is not huge, it has some great choices. The drink menu is slightly more extensive, with a lot of cocktails to choose from (we tried the viper and mojito..yum!) for appetizers we had the black bean hummus and the shrimp flatbread, both were amazing. For dinner we ordered the scallops, the bolognese (made with prime rib), and the chickpea salad and tabouli. All of it was fantastic, although the bolognese was a little rich. The rest of the menu looked great, several steak and chop options with some other great appetizers. The staff was very polite and welcoming, food was delicious. Will definitely be returning here every chance I get!"}
{"text":"I've been to 5Church twice now for Kyle and Samantha Busch's foundation dinner. On a special events level, they are fantastic. They customize the whole night for this event - everything from the decorations, drink menu, and the food menu. The staff is fantastic. Last night, Greg was our waiter. He was so lively and helpful. He made the night more fun and took into consideration my picky eating habits.  If you have an opportunity to go to 5Church, you should do so! It's a bit pricey, but the food and service is worth it!"}
{"text":"Every aspect of this restaurant was wonderful.  Great food, perfect presentation, delicious taste and fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to 5Church for awhile now, and was pretty jealous when the missus went for a lunch function at her job. When I saw their menu for Restaurant Week I was pretty set on going. Their menu didn't offer much in the way of savings (the dinner we had would have cost only slightly more on a normal day) but it was enticing enough to give us an excuse to go together for dinner.  5Church is a pretty busy place, which was a turn-off for me. Tables were crammed close together and it was extremely loud, despite how large the dining area is. The regular menu was a mixture of affordable and pricey, and all of the items available for Restaurant Week were on the lower end of the pricing spectrum. Our waitress was friendly and service was a good pace...not too fast and not too slow, despite the Restaurant Week crowds.  For an appetizer I had the Crispy Pork Belly ($4), which was not an appetizer but a tiny bite. It consisted of two very small strips of pork belly on top of a bed of cabbage tossed in an Asian sauce. The pork belly was crisp and tasty, and the cabbage took nothing away from the overall flavor. It was a tasty three bites, but I would rather pay a little more for a more substantial portion of food. The missus had Quinoa Tabbouleh ($4), and I actually preferred this. It was still considered a \"snack\" by their menu, but unlike the pork belly it was actually a heaping portion of food. I never thought of eating quinoa cold, but it was very tasty. There is a hint of lemon in it that I really enjoyed for whatever reason. It also came with these fried wontons that you could scoop into the quinoa. The quinoa was definitely worth the price, but the pork not so much.  For dinner I had the Grilled Hangar Steak ($19 on the dinner menu.) I will say that it was one of the better steaks I've had in the area. It was actually cooked to order...many times when I order a steak medium rare it turns out more rare or medium. It was a good portion of tender meat and had a great beef flavor to it. I really enjoyed the sauce it was served with, and I usually like my steak naked. The horseradish mashed potatoes were also very good, and I was glad to find that the horseradish was not strong at all, as I am not a fan of it normally. It also came with some mixed vegetables which were a bit plain and boring on their own, but I mixed them with the sauce and the mashed potato and they were fine. This steak was the cheapest steak they had, which I'm sure is why they popped it on the Restaurant Week Menu...with this steak being this good I would love to try one of their steaks in the $30-40 range.   The missus ordered the Wasabi Crusted Salmon and enjoyed it quite immensely. The salmon was cooked well and tasted fresh. I liked the wasabi exterior of the salmon, as it gave it a slight kick. There was a small bit of seaweed salad on top of the salmon which was surprisingly decent, and the bok choy was very good, though a bit overcooked for my personal taste. The missus ate most of her dinner, which is something she rarely does, so she really enjoyed her meal.  For dessert we each split the S'mores Trifle and Banana Pudding. The S'mores Trifle was incredible...a hot chocolate cake/brownie that was topped with this marshmallow cream. The marshmallow is toasted so it gets that browned, burned goodness that a good campfire marshmallow has, and combined with the hot chocolate cake it becomes this tastetacular treat. The Banana Pudding was also very good. It was a banana mousse that had more of a custardy consistency and was topped with some cream. It was accompanied with three slices of banana that were bruleed and had that hard, sugary crust on them. It's hard to tell which dessert was best, as we gobbled them both up.  It's also worth noting that we paid $15 each for a three-course wine paring to accompany each course. For the appetizer and entree you received a choice of red or white wine, and with dessert you could either get a dry red wine, Prosecco or bourbon. Seeing how most of their wine glasses were $8 and up, we figured it would be a good bargain to get three drinks for $15. All the drinks were great selections and  were more than a bit tipsy leaving that night.    I would like to go back to 5Church in the future based on our experience here for Restaurant Week. The place may be a bit too crowded and loud for my personal taste, but the food was done pretty dang well. It could be a bit pricey depending on what you get, but there were a good number of lower-priced items on the menu. 5Church might be one of those places we save for a special occasion or when family come to visit, and nicer dinner is in order."}
{"text":"It pains me not to be able to offer a 5 star review for 5Church. After all, 5 is in the name! But in my experience, it's just not all it could be.  I've been for a Yelp event, for dinner, and for brunch. For the Yelp event, I was most impressed with the service - seeing staff members hoof it up and down the stairs with huge trays of food and keeping all the Yelpers happy. That's an excellent characteristic to observe in a staff. However, that's not all to the story.  My second visit was for dinner, and while the Mr enjoyed a fantastic 60 second steak, my tofu entree was underwhelming at best. I appreciate restaurants that have a thoughtfully executed vegetarian entree, so tossing slabs of tofu on a plate doesn't quite cut it for me. I've checked the menu and found that the current token vegetarian entree is now, in fact, a different iteration of a tofu dish. Here's hoping it's better than its predecessor.  As for brunch, I was prepared to be blown away. After all, despite my misgivings after having had the dinner, I figured brunch would have to be a step up. Also, if you're going to fire up a brunch in this town, you really have to bring your finest....I don't come with a hangover, so I'm in full foodie force.  For brunch, we sat at the bar and split a cocktail and I ended up with an omelette. It was not made with love. It could have been so much better, but it was limp instead of fluffy. Although I chose excellent ingredients, it was ultimately a big disappointment.  I asked for one side, and was brought another. I think the same thing happened to the Mr.   But here's the thing, I really like 5Church. I think it's a good concept. I see how hard their leadership works to create something unique and sought-after here in Charlotte. I appreciate that they respond well to Yelp reviews. I just don't think they have it all together.  I'll definitely come back, because I believe in these guys. I believe that I'll have a chance in the near future to write a 4 or 5 star review. But until that day comes, I have to stand by my experiences and write an honest review."}
{"text":"I Cant say enough good things about this place. I was introduced to the place by a friend that worked at Nan and Byrons. Their company party was hosted there. I instantly fell in love with with the decor and ambiance. They didn't have any of their menu items on the buffet but everything was delicious. I made a mental note to come back and give them a try. My family came to town for the CIAA and my nieces 25th birthday. Perfect time to show off one of Charlotte's Gems. I ordered the shrimp flatbread and the lamb burger and duck fat fries. I was not disappointed. The goat cheese and arugula on the lamb burger worked well together and my flat bread was light and crispy. The rest of our party ordered steak and 3 of them ordered the Pan chicken, Everyone was very happy with their selections. I cant wait until my next visit to 5Church!"}
{"text":"What a great looking establishment! I love the light fixtures, absolutely beautiful. They also managed to create \"separate\" areas around the floor plan, so it can be quited intimate should you need it to be for one of your secret escapades... *wink*   The appetizers presented were all quite lovely and tasty. The cheese thingy threw me off at first as I thought I was going to bite into a white fish of some sort.   Since we were all jam packed in there, the heat was a bit much. I now know what a whore sweating in church would feel like! HA This Diabla was not ready for that hot and sticky mess... way too many peeps crammed in there.   The waitstaff was pretty impressive running up and down those stairs all night.. all I cold think of (and check out) was the BUNS of steal... yep that's right, I was checking some arse out!   Anywho... I look forward to my return, going to make it a brunch as their menu looks great and they have live music... what a great way to start a day and I will actually get to say, \"Hey, I actually went to Church\" hahahahaha"}
{"text":"Gave this place a second chance. The dinner was great (I had the 60 Second NY Strip and Dale had the Sea Scallops). The service was great and they were very accommodating with some food restrictions. A great experience. I am glad I was encouraged to give them another try...."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner after a lot of anticipation.  The environment is pretty cool, but it was extremely loud.  We also hated the seating, as this is one of those places where they sit people on top of each other.  The food and drink were ok.  We definitely enjoyed the hot bread to start, and the cocktails were not bad, but pretty watered down.  For dinner we got the braised short ribs, which were fine as well, but nothing memorable.  Overall, for the price, the value was not there.  If you want to spend a lot of money on food and get great service, you would be better off going to a steakhouse in uptown.  I don't think we will be going back here again."}
{"text":"There is no changing table in any bathroom. I was offered a tablecloth to place on the floor..."}
{"text":"The place is pretty uppity, but the food is delicious!!   There is an upstairs, midlevel & downstairs areas. Very swanky/hipster style atmosphere. Fun style that all the servers wear chucks!! Giedre, was our server - took a title warming up to, but she was wonderful!!  Best Tip about this place: $36 for the Prime \"60 Second\" NY Strip Steak - WORTH DOUBLE, most mouthwatering steak I have ever tasted!!"}
{"text":"This is a super cool place right across the street from the beautiful First Presbyterian Church. It is very trendy with a lot of hip people. I sat at the bar and ordered the ahi tuna which was pretty good. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for restaurant week. Overall, it was good but I'm not sure I would come back to sit down and eat - the crowd that was there for drinks and apps seemed to be having a better time.   The location is great if you work or live Uptown, easily walkable. Even if you don't they have a complimentary valet service. Also, the atmosphere inside is interesting - I definitely get more of a clubby vibe than a sit down restaurant (and we were there during the week for dinner) because the space is fairly loud between people chatting and music going in the background. It's also super dark - I've heard of mood lighting but this was on a different level.   The food itself was decent, since it was restaurant week I was choosing from that menu. The winter squash salad was underwhelming to say the least, my entree of seared tuna was fantastic, and the smores dessert while good wasn't necessarily anything to rave about. Our server was wonderful though, he was very informative and attentive even considering how busy it was.   I might go back again for drinks or during restaurant week, but that's likely it."}
{"text":"I love this place! It was recommended to me when we first moved to Charlotte. I tried scallops (which were very tasty). Highly recommend! The ambiance is great too."}
{"text":"Great, quick service. Amazing food and fantastic drinks. Andrew the waiter was fantastic and informative! The wild mushroom omelet was fulfilling. The restaurant overall is beautiful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Black jeans, grey shirt, black tie and black Chucks. Sounds like something out of every hip GQ man's closet, my closet. As cool as I dress, sorry to disappoint, that is your waiter's wardrobe my friend.   Super sexy and super loud. Decor is modern and cool as heck with their M16 lamps. Yep, you heard me, M16s! I couldn't read the chalk, but rumor is someone wrote the Art of War up there. I guess the M16's make sense now!  Food is A-okay, a lil' pricey though. My only gripe is about the bartender (see ART of Yelp), as I have not forgotten."}
{"text":"Valentine's Day 2018. They had a special menu- valet parking- we had a reservation. Overall very nice experience, we happily enjoyed our Valentine's Day. The bar tender and table service was very pleasant. Food was good, we both had the Filet Mignon."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better \"changes\" for uptown dining.  Food was great, service was even better... and this place can get pretty hoppin' after with the after work crowd.    I'm not sure how it is on weekends, but with the decor and the swanky finishes, this place should be a go-to place.  Already trying to put together my next trip here - to try more of their menu that has some pretty quirky and original stuff from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Phenomenal customer service! Best experience in Charlotte! Food incredible! Hope that sums it up!"}
{"text":"The decor was very eye catching and interesting in a good way. There was no wait which was really nice.  The food was very favorable and unique. My wife ordered the biscuits and gravy which she described as savory. I ordered the hanger steak and eggs. A classic that was done just perfectly and served the perfect serving.   The desert was simply out of this world (lemon brûlée tartar).   The only thing that kept it from getting five stars was the drinks. (Mojitos & bloody marry)."}
{"text":"Charlotte is one of my favorite cities to visit and 5Church turned out to be a great (and lucky) random dinner pick.  First, they have free valet parking, which is about as perfect as it is rare, considering this restaurant is in a lively area near the new baseball stadium. And the valets quite literally sprint to get your car.  The restaurant itself is very chic. On the left is a lengthy bar area backdropped by an enormous wine rack. There are a couple of TVs positioned high that I'd imagine are near impossible to see. This isn't the type of bar that even needs TVs.  The ceiling is scrawled with phrases (poetry?). The tables and booths are plush and comfortable. The menu is a mix between small plates, high end steaks and sandwiches and seafood. The lamb burger was the best I've ever had. Perfectly tender (just right at medium) and slathered with red onion marmalade, gorgonzola and arugula. I devoured it. Four large confit potatoes (really supersized french fries) were a pleasing side, as was the curry-like dipping sauce. My friend raved about the herb-brined and roasted chicken.  I had a \"new fashioned,\" which tasted like a typical, strong old fashioned and a local draft beer. The cocktail menu is solid, but no better than the bars around my home.  The lamb burger, cocktail and beer came to less than $30 after tax. Very reasonable. I feel hesitant giving 5 stars after just one visit, but when my biggest complaint are the elevated TVs, I'd say it's worth it."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! I went for brunch and got waffles and the omelet. It was amazing. Although it was packed, they seated quickly even without a reservation, the food was great, and the service was great.  The interior design is cool, edgy, but welcoming.  Although crowded it is not the best and I'm not one for high top tables and chairs but it was different from other restaurants in Charlotte .  The waffles came with sautéed peaches in a light syrup, and chai latte syrup which was sweet yet refreshing. The waffle was amazing and cooked perfectly. The omelet came with toast and potatoes. The honestly potatoes were amazing. They were well cooked, not overly seasoned, and had a good amount of potatoes. The omelet was okay - nothing spectacular - the waffles definitely stole the show. But overall great food.  Love this place!  Prices are not too high but high enough to fit the design."}
{"text":"I visited 5Church last year on a business trip and have been begging my boss to let me go back ever since.  I'm a huge fan.  While the service was a bit slow, the food was amazing.  My coworker and I split the lamb and a bunch of small plates.  The lamb was cooked to perfection and the beet slider was bomb-diggity.  (Technical term)  But if you want to taste heaven in a glass, you MUST, I say MUST try the S'mores.  It's like they mixed a pot de creme with caramel with brownie and topped it all with toasted marshmallow fluff.  REally??  Yes.  I'm not kidding.  It's delicious."}
{"text":"Went with a large group at lunch and was so pleased with our experience. Cool atmosphere and decor and not overly loud and crowded. Service was swift and food was amazing! I had the fried chicken BLT with pimento cheese and hand cut fries. Quite possibly the best sandwich I've ever had! Moist, crispy chicken fried to absolute perfection and served with pimento cheese, tomato lettuce, thick crispy bacon... on a brioche bun. I'm making myself hungry again writing about it! Fries were excellent as well. My colleagues were also very happy with their choices of the steak burger, pork tacos and the poke. I'll return soon!"}
{"text":"Came to 5Church for a team holiday lunch and everyone walked away happy.  Some of the things ordered around the table were the lamb burger, NC shrimp flatbread, chicken sandwich, bibb salad and the mixed green salad with wine poached pears.  The service was friendly although the food came out a bit slow considering things didn't seem all that busy.  They were very accommodating to a variety of menu \"adjustments\", even suggesting some to help one of our party come to a decision on what she wanted.  I've seen the dinner menu and look forward to a return visit some evening."}
{"text":"I know I'm definitely the oddball out when I say I'm not a fan of 5Curch, but I feel that it's better to be true on here than to sugarcoat it.  I've been here a few times because people often want to try it for the hype, but I've never experienced that \"wow, this is definitely a place I'm impressed by\" moment.   Before this place opened up and even currently, people rave about this place because there is nothing else that even comes close to it in Charlotte.  This place attempts to bring the feel of New York City's restaurants and lounges to Charlotte; however, I believe they have dramatically missed the mark because I'm still trying to figure out who they are. This place suffers from a problem that many new spots in Charlotte face... identity crisis. What is this place trying to be? Is it a bar, a lounge, a restaurant, or an eclectic night spot? Until they help to clarify this question I don't know they can be something phenomenal; however, this place will continue to be successful simply because it's located in Charlotte where there is no spots that really define greatness.  But I cannot review this place without saying that the food they serve here is unbelievable (hence how they get two stars). I really wish they took this place and made food there first priority because then it would be something to talk about. With their chef coming from New York City and previously cooking under Daniel Boulud, you can definitely taste the quality and depth of each dish you take in."}
