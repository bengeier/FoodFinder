{"text":"Absolutely amazing Italian coffees. The atmosphere, set-up and clientele remind me of being in Italy."}
{"text":"I stood right at the counter, made eye contact with both the waiter and barista and waited as they hustled and bustled. They stared at the counter any time they came near me and I watched as no less than ten beverages were prepared for other customers, all while I was ignored.

I began to look around for a line or designated \"ordering spot\", but found none. I looked back at both men, looked around again and watched as someone standing right next to me, who'd come in after me, had their order taken.

I reached the conclusion that for some reason, I was persona non grata. I have literally never been treated this way in my life. I'm not sure why I was deemed not cool enough to give them my money, but luckily for me there are plenty of similar/better places nearby, so I won't have to find out."}
{"text":"C'est dans un microcosme italien sans présomption que vous prendrez un espresso digne et crémeux à souhait. Le cappuccino est évidemment autant prisé. On a le droit à quelques beaux spécimens de stéréotypes : vieillards italiens attablés en rond, s'exprimant dans leur langue maternelle avec vivacité, tant avec la voix que les mains, décoration murale exagérément élogieuse à l'égard des voitures Ferrari, et un «rush» continuel, causé par une affluence d'habitués et de passants curieux (moi). C'est sans conteste l'un des points de rassemblement fort estimés de la communauté italo-montréalaise. Les télévisions nous présentent le sport à la journée longue, surtout lorsqu'il s'agit de foot!...

On y sert de la cuisine modeste : paninis, tartines au Nutella (très aimées), quelques sandwichs de charcuteries et autres petites spécialités aux piments et aubergines marinées. C'est un excellent emplacement pour prendre un café à la hâte, un peu désinvolte, assis sur un tabouret donnant au comptoir. Mon espresso ne m'a coûté que 1,50$, prix très avantageux étant donné qu'on y boit pas de la lavasse torréfiée. Le service a été un peu lent, mais c'est tout à fait compréhensif puisque le serveur était aussi le cuisinier... Tout seul le monsieur...à servir cafés par-ci, paninis par-là, faire payer les clients...et, bien-sûr, piquer des jasettes avec sa loyale clientèle...

Avis, tant aux lève-tôt qu'aux couche-tard: le café est ouvert tous les jours de 6h00 à 23h00..."}
{"text":"Mom-and-pop kind of place.  Seems like it might be family run place with the guys behind nice to customers.  Modest decor.  They sell a hodgepodge of Italian things from coffee to sandwiches to toothpaste and lotions.

Good expresso there!  Plus it was cheap too ($5 CSD)!"}
{"text":"delicious perfect coffee.

The sandwiches are also absolutely delicious and so worth the trip. PLEASE TRY THEM.  They are perfect.

You will find soccer, race cars, Jesus, and nutella.

What more do you want?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for coffee. I've yet to have any food but ooooouufff! The coffee is amaaaaaazing. Forget Star$$$ucks and $econd $up. Toilet water compared to Caffè Italia.
The atmosphere is old school and unpretentious. I believe they're open to 10pm every night. Perfect for that evening java craving. Bring a book, a friend or watch a game on the tvs. It's worth a detour to check out."}
{"text":"Arguably the smoothest creamiest lattes in town...if you get a good barista who takes the time to do it right, you will know what I mean. 

The atmosphere is interesting, lots of old Italian men and their second and third generation offspring mixed with people who just want some good coffee.

The one downside is that some baristas here would rather chat with their friends who have just arrived and plan their night up clubbing than give you any attention. 

Conclusion: you must try it, but if it doesn't meet your expectations the first time, it's probably due to lazy service, go back for more and you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"This cafe looks authentic and cute and is definitely worth a visit. However, I thought that my coffee (latte) was very average - pretty much Starbucks quality.  Since I expected the coffee here to be amazing, I was a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Un café qui nous rappelle l'Europe. J'adore y aller pour la crowd: plein d'Italiens et quelques Montréalais bien sûr. Une ambiance vivante, plein de vas et viens, du bon café, un service amical, et de délicieux sandwich. Il y a une game de soccer? Dirigez vous à l'arrière du restaurant, et prenez place avec l'auditoire enflammée. Une institution dans la petite Italie."}
{"text":"Le café est excellent et l'endroit totalement typique! Le service est n'est pas très sympathique et si vous n'êtes pas un habitué... vous pourriez attendre! Mais bon, ça demeure un moyen d'être témoins de la vielle faune de la Petite Italie"}
{"text":"Hopefully this will be rated as an historic monument soon. Seriously good coffee, served among genuine Italian old guys. This is a real cafe, not some mamby pamby hispter joint where you pay four bucks for a latté made by a bearded kid who sort of finished their art history degree.  

Warning: genuine factor means that the servers might not have beards, and yes, Italian hair gel is also available in the display case.  Really. 

I'm not religious.... but God bless Caffé Italia."}
{"text":"Busy, loud, lively, fast, somewhat chaotic - that's how I would describe Caffè Italia. A cafe that doesn't try to pretend to be what it's not and stays true to what it is - a historic icon where local patrons in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s+ drop in for their espresso, dunk their panettone, watch some sports, pay (cash) and then leave to carry on their day.

Open from 7am till 11pm this place just never seems to stop. Sitting at the bar you'll often see an order of 10 or more cups that come all at once! Amazingly no words are exchanged between waiters and the Barrista. I was trying to decode the system, a combo of saucer, glass spoons and positions that minimizes the need to talk and focus on delivery! Spoon in cup means decaf, two spoons on plate is an allongé, spoon down is double shot, etc.

Tip: Don't try to sit at the corner table unless you're looking for dirty looks. This where the older italian men hang out to talk about soccer, politics and sometimes about weather. 

\"Keep it real is what it's all about... Montrealers like it like that\" I was told by a regular. You won't see any fancy foam art but the crema is thick, exactly what you would expect from fresh coffee beans being hit at the right temperature and 12 bars of pressure. All drinks are very reasonably priced: Espresso at $1.75 and Latte or Cappuccino at $2.75!  Food-wise staples are mortadella, capicollo or salami sandwiches, toasts with choice of jam, peanut butter or Nutella and your traditional variety of italian sweets. Interestingly enough, behind the counter, where cigarettes packs used to be displayed, you can get hard to find Italian men grooming items such as Proraso (Italy #1 shaving cream), Felce Azzura (Talc Powder) and Pastel del Capitano (italian toothpaste).

The original owner is a nice lady who just recently celebrated her 76th birthday. She inherited the cafe from her parents who moved from Italy and opened this place when she was 16! The place is now run by her two daughters backed by a clever Barista (Paolo) and staff that crack you up if you pay attention to what they are saying. No frills, no fuss just good caffè - this is what it's all about."}
{"text":"Good no frills cappuccino place. It's very plain but cappuccinos were right on the money. They were perfect temperature and delicious. It reminded me of awesome cappuccinos we had on our Italy trip."}
{"text":"Location: On the main, in the heart of Little Italy. Street parking or transit. 

The place: It's one hot mess and if I were to use one word to describe the place, that word would be 'chaos'. On one hand, the bar area reminds me of Rome, where one tosses back their caffé like a shot while observing the baristas hone their craft, then quickly hit the road. However, Café Italia lacks the organization of Italian caffés. Over there, you order at the cash, take your receipt then walk over to the bar and wait for your coffee. Once you're done, off you go. At Italia, it's one big free-for-all where patrons come in and huddle around the bar without any order whatsoever. So you can be there for ten minutes while some guy walks in off the street and places his order in ahead of you. It's a survival of the fittest kind of situation. I hate inefficiency. Also, people actually do sit at the bar and linger rather than leave once they're done. But that's fine - I mean, I personally think coffee should be lingered over anyway. They do have tables if you're not a fan of the bar.

The coffee: Ordinary and a bit too bitter (I had a Macchiato). I prefer Olimpico or Myriade. 

Service: Grumpy. That's really all I have to say about that. 

Price point: Excellent - it cost $3.50 for a Macchiato and an Espresso. Can't beat that!

Would I go back? Maybe I'll give them another go on a quieter day but I won't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"Bien que ce soit une institution, l'endroit offre également un café exceptionnel. Les weekend l'endroit est bondé."}
{"text":"Really good Italian coffee with an old school charm. Had a coffee at the counter here after a lunch nearby. Was a great way to finish a lunch hour meal."}
{"text":"Every time we go to Montreal, we come here.  Located in \"little Italy\", this place is the perfect spot.  We always get a cappuccino or latte and a black and white cookie..  The coffee drinks are not \"American size\", so I am sure to some people may think they seem small.  

This place has a small diner feel and the owner has always been there when we are there.  The last visit a soccer match was on and the back room (with the TV) was filled with Italian men celebrating the game. 

This place is a must for the real feel deal!

Cash only"}
{"text":"A local caffè in Little Italy perfect for people watching and perfect for grabbing a cappuccino!  In fact I stopped in twice in one day for quick pick me ups.  

++.  Ambiance is local social gathering spot inside or people watch from their side walk seats on St Laurent.  

++. Espresso bevies Italian style.  I ordered at the bar to go -  my cap was so tasty that I returned a few hours later for another :-)

+.  Service is friendly and fast

+.  Price is reasonable.my cap was CAD$3.50 + tip.

-   Parking is street (metered) and tight.  Best to walk or Uber/lyft/cab."}
{"text":"Well well, Caffè Italia is one of those places you have to go!  Once you walk through the door, you've left Montreal behind, and have stepped into a scene from Italy.

Friendly staff, and the coffee is obviously fantastic.

You can always grab a cup of coffee and since you are almost next door to Ducati Montreal, swing in there and enjoy some beautiful Italian machinery.

This place really deserves a 5 star but I do really think that 5th star is in the smallest details, and unfortunately the styrofoam to go cups don't do it for me."}
{"text":"I've searched high and low for a place in New York that makes a cappuccino comparable to this one, and come up empty. This is the #1 must-visit for me every trip to Montreal, best coffee and best old-school atmosphere around bar none! I get one cup to stay and soak in the scene, then another one to go. I unknowingly came to town right on their 60th anniversary, and was honored to have a chance to pay tribute. Salute!"}
{"text":"Best cappuccino I have ever tried, I even had to get a second cup if you're ever around  little Italy in Montreal, give it a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"De l'extérieur ça n'a rien d'attrayant, il ne s'agit pas d'un de ces cafés modernes qui ressemble à tous les autres. Ici on boit du caffè et on aime l'authenticité. On se retrouve en plein cur de l'Italie avec son folklore, son ambiance et son bon caffè. Un excellent détour pour ceux qui veulent se dépayser quelques instants."}
{"text":"Simple coffee offerings at this place. I had a cheap latte during the afternoon, grabbed a seat outside, and just chilled. Really strong coffee and quick and efficient service. Cash only. Good coffee. Nice for an afternoon sip."}
{"text":"This cafe has a special place in my heart. It is not only where I had my first date with my first boyfriend (now first ex), but it is the very place that made me turn into the die-hard biscotti and coffee lover/aficionado that I claim myself to be now. 

Seriously, the best espresso is served here. I have a piece of Caffe Italia in my home, a bag of their home roast beans. Some people can't stand Italian coffee for its strong bitterness, but I enjoy every sip of it. The biscotti comes on a small heated plate, dare I say, saucer. The original is usually chewier, owing to its less-hard texture. I believe this cafe is where I first ate a whole biscotti, and from then on, I began to express my devotion and love to biscottis by ordering them in any cafe across Montreal that sold them.

Without a doubt, Caffe Italia will be one of the landmarks of Montreal that I shall miss after this year. I shall miss the drinks and sweets, but also the wood panelling, the multiple photos of the cafe's interior and exterior since its founding, framed posters of famous F1 competitors, the Crucifixion cross above the unisex washroom, Italian men crowding around the TVs, the outdoor tables, and even the occasional man in the back writing away like some serious poet or philosopher."}
{"text":"Such a nice place- reminds me of the cafès back home in the North End (Boston). I got a cappuccino while my parents ordered lattes. If papa says it reminds him of Italia you better believe it's the real deal. The owner was very nice and happened to chat with us while we were seated. It felt as though we were sitting at my Nonna's kitchen table instead of a cafè in a different country. Love it!"}
{"text":"As a 2nd generation Italian, you know you're stepping in an authentic Italian caffe when it's 7:30 AM and 15 elderly Italians are sharing the place with you speaking to one another in different dialects of Italian with plenty of hand gestures to go around about \"La Seria A\" (it was Monday).

I ordered a cappuccino to go and was immediately received in a very friendly fashion despite on how busy it was. The quality of my cappuccino was exceptional and served quickly.

The price tag is a bit higher than some other places I know (with an extra fee of ordering to go?) but you'll pay for it and accept it. There's no denying the quality of this place and you pay more for quality.

La qualita e la.

Will visit again."}
{"text":"This is the legit shit. Serving up espresso that makes my people proud. Where the nonnos go for an espresso. That's a sign right there. Straight up, honest, like your nonna made it. Basically, the original hipsters right here. More like original coffee gangsters."}
{"text":"For the price , this place is not bad!! It's welcoming ,nothing fancy but I felt like I was getting coffee from mom!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I noticed a while back that below the back counter they have bags of Caffè Italia home roast espresso beans. $14 for a chic little white bag of hefty nutty flavor, these beans make some good brew. This is now my caffeination of choice - fresh ground at home and bubbled up in my caffettiera on the stove top, it's like having Italia in my apartment any time I like. Minus the swarthy, serious baristos. 

Sidenote: the Mayor of Montreal walked in here the other day followed by a photographer, shook everyone's hand while the pap snapped and left quick. Paying homage to the real powers that be in MTL? Maybe! Looking for a friendly neighborhoody photo op while dealing with ongoing student strikes? Golly gee, seems likely."}
{"text":"Caffe Italia is the real deal. Don't expect any frills or a hip Instagram account to follow- you'll get a small table in a loud room full of old Italian fellows and a really solid espresso. Their in-house blend is quite dark which may appeal to some coffee drinkers averse to lighter third-wave blends. Their capps are basically perfect.

The decor hasn't changed much and the ambience is authentic (and not \"authentic\" like the shitty reclaimed wood/industrial stool/moustache shtick you'll find elsewhere.) They also make a mean sandwich if you're hungry.

Overall, a really satisfying experience with a classic ambience which really contrasts with younger shops across the city."}
{"text":"Love their cappuccino! It was like being in Italy.  Delicious! I didn't care much for their proscuitto sandwich, but just loved the cafe and the family owned vibe of the place."}
{"text":"Best cappuccino I will ever have. I enjoyed the atmosphere and listened to the older gentlemen discuss, in Italian, what I can only guess would be news, politics or soccer.
So glad we stopped here!"}
{"text":"Perfect experience as always, I love this place, a true Italan experience in Montreal"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian coffee.  Complete with 15 old Italian guys standing around speaking Italian on a weekday.  Great latte."}
{"text":"Definitely a mom-and-pop kind of place.  Seems like it might be family run?  The guys behind the counter were friendly to the customers.  Very modest decor (some chairs and tables with a TV).  They sell a hodgepodge of Italian things from coffee to sandwiches to toothpaste and lotions.

Amazing expresso there!  I don't know what is unique about it, but it was one of the best cappuccinos that I've had in a while.  Had a nutella toast to go with the capp, and it was enough for a morning meal.  Plus it was cheap too ($5 CSD)!"}
{"text":"such a throwback... imagine if all the chain pseudo cafes were like caffe italia. then there would be no long waits for the the skim - soy milk, iced macchiato, frappucino drinkers,... and hopefully no devices and WiFi,... just great simple \"hot\" coffees and conversations. one can dream.

aside from the amazing drinks and the personable barista, they also make killer sandwiches. its such a throwback that they even sell hygienic products, that's super old school,... and we wished there were more of them still around."}
{"text":"I was really craving for some good coffee, my sister-in-law is Italian and every time we are in little Italy she passes by Cafe Italia, she says they have the best coffee, so  obviously my choice would be to come here. It was around 9pm and the place was full of old Italian men talking loudly and laughing and probably reliving their youth. It was actual nice to see, we sat down and the girl behind the bar came and gave us menus and said that they had some cookies and pastries up front and if we wanted anything to let her know. We ordered two cappuccinos and 2 biscotti's.

Cafe Italia has been here for a long time and you see all the pictures they have through the years. It's very homey. Although almost everyone was speaking Italian, but I truly enjoyed my surroundings.

Now for the taste, the cappuccino was so gooooood, best cappuccino I have ever had, the biscotti's were huge, not your average little cookie, but ginormous. I was really happy I gave it a try and would definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"There is nothing more satisfying to me to find a  Montrealer owned coffee shop! There is  quite a few, however a coffee shop that is as old as the times. , 
 A montreal made all italian , coffee blessing! A soccer (or is it football) fan delight
I implore you while visiting the Jean Talon market go across the street and visit this lil slice of italy."}
{"text":"Best espresso in town! Order it short and your caffeine boost is guaranteed. The entire coffee shop is such an experience to be in, the elderly Italians talking in Italian between each other, the beautiful coffee bar with the small stools, the old school classical tables and chairs. They even sell Italian eau de cologne, look behind the bar on your left and you will see the old fashioned packages of cosmetics. Their cappuccino is quite good too, get some biscotti along with your coffee and happiness will be upon you!"}
{"text":"Best coffee we had in Montreal. I had latte, my partner had an Americano with milk. Both had rich, deep and bold flavour. Wow. Really exceptional coffee. Cool ambiance too. Soccer on the screens, families with 3 generations including young kids and lots of old men speaking Italian. Big windows ensuring cool breeze and great service too."}
{"text":"The menu is limited, and that's fine, because I understand it's an Italian coffee shop. And the drink is good and well made, I believe the staff to be trained well. However, our one time experience took the impression that the boys behind the counter didn't care about customers other than to fill their cup well. I'm kind to roughness, but there's a difference between gruff and indifference for the well-being of patrons. The atmosphere isn't all-encompassing enough to be the essence, and neither is the coffee. The space is so open and sharing that the essence should be the people that inhabit it. The kids running the show had some negative vibes running through them that day. Maybe it was just one bad day, but if that's the case then they shouldn't be offended by one negative review."}
{"text":"I love stopping here when I'm in Little Italy because they have great coffee for reasonable prices.  I can't comment on the food because I usually get coffee only.  The espresso is of high quality and is not  bitter like at some coffee shops.  It goes down smoothly.  Also their cappuccinos are always worth getting.

The place has the feel of an old school Italian espresso bar which I love and there is a TV which broadcasts Italian football matches on the weekends."}
{"text":"Ah but what to say about Caffe Italia but amazing coffee whether you choose espresso, cappuccino, Latte.....you'll taste the quality from the first sip! 
I come here now and then and always look forward to the visit
It is true old school Italian style! 
The sandwiches are always amazing as well they have pannetoni, \"S\" cookies and more it is truly an Italian experience and always be a favorite place to me!

Tutti va bene dopo una cafe di Caffe Italia!!"}
{"text":"After a week in Montreal and trying about 7 different coffee places, if have to say that this was the best out of all of them. Unfortunately, it's not the best I've ever had. 

It's so unfortunate to be spoiled by such great coffees and espressos! The ambiance is like that of a sporty cafe where elders and men stop by to watch a soccer game, read a newspaper, and enjoy a nice cup of latte or cappuccino."}
{"text":"Bon cappuccino + bon sandwich, un café classique de la Petite Italie ! Assez kitsch, comme déco avec des vieux cadres de la sélection italienne de soccer, des posters de Formule 1 et aussi pleins de vieux italiens qui prennent leurs expressos et lisent leurs journaux. Prix très abordables, service correct, assurez-vous que le serveur vous vois car ça risque d'être long, café populaire toujours rempli. Dépaysement assuré, comme si vous étiez en Italie. Ciao ! 4/5 Visité en mars 2015."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything here: espresso, latte, cappuccino, they're all fabulous. I personally come here to listen to the banter, sit at the counter and take in the ambiance. The place has never changed and noe should it, it's a true gem on St. Laurent."}
{"text":"If I was Toni Soprano, I would certainly hang out here with all my compadres. If you're from Montreal, and never visited this place... \"Ma che cazzo fai\".  A Montreal classic that is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great Italian cafe that still looks like it's in the 1960s with old Italian men at the bar sipping their espressos in the morning. I ordered an iced latte and it was good!"}
