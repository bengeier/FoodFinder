{"text":"What a great experience! The waitstaff was attentive and professional. The food was incredible! Great salsa and awesome margaritas! This place is off to a great start."}
{"text":"We went here thinking it was Si Casa Flores and were game to give it a go. The staff was VERY friendly and perhaps a bit OVER accommodating in their efforts to promote and get this place going.   The food was hardly 'fresh' - canned slop refried beans, blah spanish rice, and lukewarm entree. The chile relleno we ordered was a 'pre-fab' - chile  and cheses wrapped in layer of scrambled eggs. Certainly NOT a proper relleno which would be dipped in beaten eggs batter and fried, not heated in a microwave. And only heated enough to seem cooked at that. The plate arrives hot, but the food on it is not.   Also disappointing was how limited the lunch 'specials' were not to mention more expensive than Si Casa's daily items were. And sodas for $2.99?!? Get real, a package of BRAND name sodas cost less!   We weren't looking for 'elegant' dining, but sadly we didn't find decent or tasty food. In fact I felt we could have as easily grabbed microwave entrees and a bag of corn chips at any grocery stores and getting about the same meal."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Waited 15 before we got offered water, waited another 45 for food. Also, our waitress was definitely hopped up on something. Never got our food"}
{"text":"I am so happy this replaced si casa Flores.  Coming from the Bay Area it's hard to find good Mexican food. Not only was the server friendly and personable, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. The beans were a perfect consistency, reminded me of when I worked at a taqueria in San Jose. The steak fajita was super tasty as well. Ask them for some grilled jalapeños. Again so glad this replaced that si casa Flores crap."}
{"text":"We were hoping this place would at least parallel the great food that Si Casa Flores had to offer--not so much. The margarita was the worst I've ever had, my vegetarian burrito had cold veggies in it (they obviously did not defrost them very well) and red sauce clearly dumped straight from a can. No one at my table was very happy with their plates. We had to ask for napkins and silverware--we had one setting for 4. They kept the beautiful decor and their chips were warm, salsa was decent, but that's about it. Fried ice cream was horrible. Service was fine, but he was overwhelmed as he place was surprisingly busy.   The food here is bland, boring, and not fresh. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"SALVATION.  Moved to Southern Oregon from the CA Bay Area last month and was praying for a \"local\" (Medford/Ashland) Mexican restaurant with great ambience, good food and a festive bar for those after work cocktails or meet-ups with friends. I happened to see this place on my way home from work and pulled into the lot & Googled them. I saw they just changed ownership and name, and the two existing reviews from their first couple days of their soft open (no ads yet, I found out) were great--so I went inside to get takeout after my exhausting day/week.  Fast forward an hour later and I'm sitting at the bar drinking a yummy & big top shelf margarita after having eaten HERE --I changed my to-go order to dine-in because the vibe in here is awesome. I ordered the seafood burrito and it was easily some of THE BEST Mexican food I've ever had. I didn't expect it to be this good, honestly. It was SO fresh and SO decadent. I'll surely be ordering this A LOT.   Considering the food, the beautiful interior, the wonderful food and drinks, and the excellent, friendly service, I really cannot wait to come back here."}
{"text":"Sad to see SiCasa go out of business but Amigos is GREAT! The staff is exceptionally friendly and VERY attentive. Chips=Great. Drinks=Great. Food=Great. SOOOOOOOOO glad that they are our new \"GO TO\" local mexican food place!! GREAT JOB!!!! Life-long customers here"}
{"text":"I would rate a zero if I could. The food has been mediocre at best  (this is my 4th visit)   My family and I have been here for almost 2 hours and the service is super poor and extremely slow.  We are NEVER coming back."}
{"text":"Located where si casa Flores at exit 24 used to be, this family mexican restaraunt is a welcome addition to Phoenix. The inside is very clean, and the staff was genuinely friendly. The food was truly delicious, and I am happy to have this family restaurant in the rogue valley."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very clean and friendly. It's very well decorated. Service is always awesome  I love eating in the bar area. Weve never had a bad visit. We order Chile relleno and carnitas chimichanga. Always on point and delicious."}
{"text":"Suzanna was a great server !! Place was packed only 2 servers but service was still great !! Food was great, she never missed a beat!! Will recommend always !! GREAT JOB BY SUZANNA !! THANK YOU !!"}
{"text":"We visited the newly reopened Mexican restaurant Amigo's last night and it was not what I expected. I was hoping that some of the recipes might follow from the past Si Casa Flores- but I don't think that's the case.  The restaurant is exactly the same as far as no decor changes. Even one of my favorite servers was there- But he was done with his shift and couldn't wait on us.  I ordered carne asada and Mike got enchiladas verdes.  The amount of meat on my carne asada is much smaller. Ok- I can deal with more realistic portions- but the rice had no flavor. I had one bite and didn't want any more. The refried beans were so bland that I didn't eat those either. What a waste of food. I got a tiny dollop of guacamole, enough for one tortilla and about the same of pico de gallo. I'm sure if I had asked for any more then of course there would be a charge. I'm used to having enough pico to get at least 3 corn tortillas worth and enough guac for at least 2. I was the top check in for the past Si Casa with 55 check ins- but sadly even though this restaurant is one block from my home- I don't think I'll be coming here like I did before unless they listen to the regulars and try to improve on some of the recipes.  Another reviewer felt that everything must've come from a can- and I'm feeling like they might be accurate.  Mike's enchiladas weren't even hot all the way through as the cheese was not melted inside. So I hope that the new owners might read and listen and change some of the blandness. And if you're going to put a roasted chili on my plate- please actually roast it and don't put it on my plate raw. Roasted chilis are yummy but raw jalapeños are not so much. The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice and the servers were ok but the food needs to be better to keep us coming again and again."}
{"text":"Tried this place a few times. It's just a disappointment. The last time we went my mom was served rotten chicken in her arroz con pollo, there was no silverware or salt and pepper on the tables. The servers never brought any or refilled our waters."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check out who replaced one my favorites \"Si Casa Flores\", The service at Amigo's was excellent, but the menu prices make it most likely one of the most expensive Mexican Restaurants in the valley. Appetizers start at $11.00, the basic burrito starts at $15.00.  We just dropped in for a drink and snack, ordered a few drinks and Nachos with cheese, ground beef with guacamole ($11.00). Small plate, guacamole was from the day before (dark).  At 5:00 PM, would have been $4.00 at Si Casa and and a bigger plate with fresh guacamole."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Tex Mex style place in East Medford.  The carne asada fries are pretty good and the service has been consistently pretty good.  I have had a burrito before that I wasn't thrilled about however. Don't go in expecting the world and you likely won't be dissatisfied."}
