{"text":"This place is a nice place to grab lunch and has a very clean and comfortable atmosphere. You can basically pick/make anything to be a pasta, salad, panini. However, the quality control needs to be improved. Once I got frozen lettuce on my sandwich that had freezer burns. I can order the same exact custom thing twice, and it will taste quite different. Also, the cheesecake I got should have been better refrigerated. All in all, an okay restaurant to grab lunch at with friends with a good atmosphere. Control quality can be improved."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Love their pizza and pasta a lot! They prepare your food very fast (like 2-5 minutes). Everything is fresh and tasty :)"}
{"text":"5 stars for menu choices. Not only does Za's carry an extensive variety of pizzas, salads and pastas that you can further customize to your liking, they also sell Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes by the slice! So if you have a sweet tooth and are ever craving a Cheesecake Factory creation, you can head to Mia Za's and get your cheesecake fix without having to order a whole expensive cake online and paying steep shipping charges on top of that.

4 stars for value for money. Generous portions of tiramisu and cheesecake slices all cost less than $5. Other menu items are reasonably priced too. Plus they have specials every day. On Thursdays, for example, a small pizza with up to 3 toppings can be had for just 3 bucks. 

3 stars for taste of Mia Za's prepared food. As one would expect, Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes are delicious but I'm afraid the Mia Za's pizza I tried wasn't extraordinary. The pesto sauce was alright, if unmemorable. The artichoke topping seemed fresh enough. But the buffalo chicken topping was just OK, lacking the awesomeness I expect from any delectable buffalo chicken. The pizza was prepared quickly but it was a little burnt at the bottom. Not sure if that's how it's supposed to be but I found that part of the crust slightly off-putting. 

Don't get me wrong. Mia Za's food isn't bad. And perhaps one really shouldn't expect gourmet food at its price point. But in a town like ours with a superb selection of restaurants, I can see why people wouldn't want to go out of their way to try Mia Za's food. That said, located as it's in the heart of Green Street, It's still a good choice for price-sensitive college students, anyone else on a shoestring budget--and, of course, for people fond of cheesecakes!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard fare here, you can customize everything, mix and match whatever crazy combination you can come up with. My absolute faaavorite  pasta sauces are the cajun alfredo and cajun pesto. I think they just add some kind of spice to make their normal sauces spicy but you should definitely try them if you like spicy food. I wish they could sell me just the sauces... that's all I would ever need in life. I'd add it to everything I eat.
I always mean to try their desserts from the Cheesecake Factory but am always too full so either plan ahead to save room or get some to go!"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. They should update their forms since they're inaccurate.  The broccolli soup was ok.  I should have gone to the panera across the street instead."}
{"text":"This food is very delicious. I have only bought the pizza from there which is delicious, however after an hour or two you'd be hungry again due to it being a thin crust pizza. I don't think there is an option for thicker crust though. The cash register lady is also very kind and friendly as well. Food only takes a couple minutes to be finished as well."}
{"text":"Za's is back!!!! OK, maybe it's been back for a while, but this was my first time back in Champaign since they reopened post-fire. I was so pleased to see that they still function the same way - design your own pasta, salad, panini, or pizza. This place was a major staple in my college-kid diet. The pasta sauces are all really tasty, and there are plenty of healthy veggie toppings. Let's not forget the amazing garlic bread, which is one of the best parts of any Za's trip. Can we please talk about the fact that Za's really needs to open a location in the Chicago area? Until then, I'll just have to wait and get my fix next time I'm down in CU. Sigh."}
{"text":"Super small portions for takeout options- got a small order of pasta for $5 and ended up with what looked like a side that did not fill me up at all. I was really disappointed because I've gotten the same pasta with the dine-in option and it was much more filling and adequately portioned. Noodles were clearly frozen and vegetables weren't too special. I like that they had tofu and mushroom options for vegetarians, which bumped it up from 1 star to 2 for me. Definitely not worth the price I paid."}
{"text":"Really? I Ordered noodles, 2 sauces, and 1 type of cheese. No cheese. Too busy chatting and flirting with each other to notice the cheese. I waited forever for my food (again to busy chatting and laughing). Shit was mediocre to begin with....not going back."}
{"text":"A Green St staple that doesn't deserve the hype.  The food is greasy, the cheese is plastic-y, dishes oversalted etc.  Nonetheless you can get a lot of food (calories) for a pretty low price, so starving students have an excuse."}
{"text":"Mia Za's has a novelty concept with generic foods.
You have to fill out a very large form to order your food. I went with a group of 3 and 2 of us did not receive what we intended to get because of the crowded environment while filling out the complicated form. The form is straight to the point for the most part but it's layout is terrible. Why can't I just verbally communicate with the cashier like at, you know, any QSR. 
Super generic food. Very little flavor. It was relatively inexpensive, which is a common theme for a college campus, but so are the other dozen restaurants on the block. You can find any of the entrees at a Potbelly's, Jimmy John's, Noodles, and Antonio's Pizza which is within a 100 yard radius of Mia Za's and all are better options."}
{"text":"Pros: the pizza is edible
Cons: the pizza tastes similar to cardboard with lunchable pizza sauce and uncooked tomatoes thrown on it. 

I understand that Champaign isn't known for its pizza but this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"I like Mia Za's, even though it's not exactly my first stop in Campustown. Lines tend to be long, and the meal I normally order is a bit steep for lunch. But it's good food and cheap Italian if you need a fix. 

I'm fond of the thin-crust pizza, and I normally get half with a spinach salad. But the menu is so diverse as to be overwhelming. Come prepared to fill out a scantron of deliciousness; it's totally worth it every once in a while, but the vast array of options slow the place down to no end."}
{"text":"As an alumnus of the University of Illinois, I often get a little teary-eyed when I visit the campus and think of both good and bad experiences I encountered there when I was a student in the mid-1960s.

I also got teary-eyed with joy when I saw Mia Za listed under the local chamber of commerce's list of \"Dining on a Dime\" restaurants near the campus.  i.e., I assumed it was cheap (and it was).

My youthful bride of 34 years (Mrs. B) and I were checking out the restaurants in the Campus town area just northwest of the Alma Mater statue.  While looking at the bill of fare at this establishment, the owner came out and gave us a sales pitch for having our dinner there.

This is a very small \"hole in the wall\" place that probably seats no more than 20 diners.  Tables are on the first floor and also on a second floor.

The gimmick here is that you are provided with a ballot-like menu to order your food.  We both decided to order a pasta meal.  So, we filled out a paper form that allows you to select the type of noodles, sauce, toppings, and other items you want to eat.  Then you hand the form to the counter attendant, and they call you when your meal is ready: usually in less than ten minutes.

The same procedure is used to choose salads, paninis, and pizza.

We were there at about 5:45 on a Monday during the summer session, so the place was not busy.  But given the lack of space at Mia Za, it could look like Groucho's stateroom in \"A Night at the Opera\" during the fall and spring semesters."}
{"text":"Great pasta dishes here.  The sandwiches are also good.  Their \"make your own\" options are nice, everyone can find something they like.  The atmosphere is nice, I prefer to eat upstairs as there is more room, and I have never had a problem with the people who work there.  

The price is rather high though, $6-$8 for a pasta dish, most of which is the pasta itself?  Give me a break."}
{"text":"The last few times I was there Mia Za's almost always messed something up in our order.  The last straw was when they included nuts in my wife's salad -- I explained to them that she was allergic, they took the salad back and I watched them just pick the nuts off in the back when they thought I couldn't see them.  When they gave it back to me I explained to them that was not sufficient as she is highly allergic.  They very rudely took the salad back and made a fresh one."}
{"text":"Horrible service. They tried to make me take food returned by another customer.  When I refused, their employee gave me such an attitude.  First they make an error and give out my order to some random customer.  Then they force me to take the food returend by that customer.  Mind you, that customer disappeared for a while before he came back to return the food.  How do I know if the food was tempered with or not.  Why do I even need to take that risk.  I am a paying customer and only want to take food prepared for me, not for \"Becca\".  And through this whole process nobody apologized for the order error or offered to make my order fresh.  I had to demand an apology and a refund.  AND it didn't come easy.  Every single one of the employees there gave me an attitude, even the owner tried to lecture me on how busy they are.  It's like they don't even have customer service.   And my order (a large salad plus chicken plus a side of soup) wasn't cheap.  I should have just gone to Panera across the street.  I'm so done with this place."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and the food is tasty, but the portions are small. It's by no means expensive, but I feel like you get less pizza, for example, than you should for the price.

There are tables and a few booths upstairs, big enough to hold about 6 people each, so it's good to go with a small group of friends. If you want Italian food that isn't too fancy and close to the quad, this is a pretty good choice."}
{"text":"I love the soup here.  Tomato Basil and whatever special of the day is on the menu.  That, and the garlic bread, even though it's 80 cents.

I tried a pizza once.  It was wet in the middle and pretty unencumbered by flavor.

I tried a smoothie once.  It was aiight.  Never been compelled to try another.

I tried a salad once.  It was pretty boring, and it made me miss Pluto's back in Palo Alto.

But the tomato basil soup, I love.  It's divine with its small sprinkling of grated parmesan (?) cheese that melts only halfway even though you stir it.  

One thing I don't appreciate is the impatient guy who calls out my name.  He was pretty obnoxious this one time when I didn't respond on the first call.  But rudeness and some small confusion about not having a form to just order soup won't keep me away from good soup on Green Street.

Under 4 bucks for a bowl of soup that comes with a small piece of french bread is good eatz.  And fast, too."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place.  The menu looks great, lots of options and fresh choices.  But I've given it a couple of tries, and the food just isn't anything special.  I've had the pear and goat cheese salad, and the portobello pizza.  The ingredients didn't seem fresh, and both dishes seemed hastily thrown together.  There are better places to eat."}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed with the food. The garlic bread was tasty but the pizza was tiny and the soup was cold. It took us quite a while before our food was ready and i'm normally a very patient person."}
{"text":"Here you can creat your own pasta and pizza. The taste is not that perfect but is enough for a quick lunch. I like their desserts and garlic bread. I order these two every time I come here."}
{"text":"Za's is a pretty good lunch option on Campustown. They serve salads, pasta, sandwiches and pizza, all made to order. You can select from their suggested dishes or order your own by choosing ingredients. It's all very reasonable ($4 to $7), not great cuisine but very tasty nonetheless. To boot, the employees are all very friendly. It's just a three minute walk from my office, so I suspect I'll be going there a lot to eat."}
{"text":"Asian rotini stir-fry and garden salad, friend accidentally got full plate!"}
{"text":"Mia Za's here on Green Street is the original. The other places of similar name (just, \"Za's\")  in Champaign have disbanded from the franchise and are their own entities. 

Mia Za's is located in a cozy little row of businesses in the heart of Campus Town conveniently adjacent to the University of illinois' main Quad.  Parking can be a bit difficult, but there are usually spaces available a block or two from the location, bring money as Parking Enforcement is serious business in and around Campus.

Depending on the time of day you may be hard-pressed to find ample seating for you and your dining companion as this place is very popular with the student population. If there isn't enough room on the main floor you can head upstairs to find more tables, and a warm atmosphere with a very beautiful copper ceiling, and Italian inspired artwork on the walls.

Their menu is full of incredibly tasty and healthy ingredients, and everything is cooked to order. It'll probably take longer for you to decide on what to order with the custom Pizza, Pasta, Panini, and Salad options. But never fear for those you that are indecisive; Mia Za's offers more traditional favorites as well.

Prices vary on what kind of sauce or items you get, and if you get extra items. With that said you can get a \"Pick 2\" where you get half an order of pasta, salad, or panini served with another half order of salad, soup, or panini for just shy of 7 dollars (without drink)."}
{"text":"I thought this was going to be the Za's from a couple years back but it is not. They took a proven concept and have butchered it with subpar ingredients and the use of a microwave. They used to cook the pasta with the sauce along with the ingredients which led to a great product that I was willing to pay for. This new Za's is putting ingredients on pasta, microwaving it, then pouring sauce and spices on after. I don't know who thought of this cooking process but it wasn't someone who knows how to cook. It was a bad experience, and now I feel a bit sick from it. If you value your stomach and tastebuds do not go to this establishment."}
{"text":"Great paninis at Mia Zas, I enjoy how you select your food there on their sheets. It makes your meal very customizable.

The atmosphere is good, sitting upstairs is great too. I knocked it 1 star for price, could be a little more affordable. Other than that, I was very satisfied."}
{"text":"First time visiting Mia Za's. I liked the ordering system. You garb a slip -different color for pizza or pasta or salad and the rest is self explanatory. Also the choices and prizes were good. I order a 5' with meatballs, green peppers and 'shrooms. I also order the tiramisu which is was told by the person who took my order was \"one of the best\". I ordered to go. The customer service was awesome and the pizza had a good taste but I thought mine was a bit burnt. The tiramisu was INCREDIBLE!"}
{"text":"Za's is the first place that I ever ate in Chambana when coming to visit for the first time (summer 2003). And yes, I do have tremendous loyalty to places of my past, so maybe I'm biased.

But Za's is awesome. The food isn't going to change the world, but they're well controlled portions, and highly customizable dishes bringa very \"it's for me\" feel to Za's. The workers (mostly college kids) have always been nice, and I've never had a thing to complain about. The upstairs seating is good enough for big crowds, and it's never been too crowded."}
{"text":"I went in here today while in Champaign to visit family so I could receive the $5 deal for a large pizza on the hooked app and received some of the worst restaurant service ever.  Stay away from the old, white-haired manager, he is absolutely awful and I don't know why he even has a job with his terrible personality. I placed my order with a very nice cashier and decided to wait in the restaurant until they called my name, not expecting what was to come. Things were going good and I really liked the place so far at this point. I was on the phone while waiting for a conference call and 1940's music was blasting in the restaurant which made it even harder to even hear my business phone conversation, let alone my name being called. 40 minutes passes by before I heard my name being called. Mind you, I am a patient person so I did not mind about the wait, and just assumed they were backed up. The white haired, older man previously mentioned he had called out my name and said that it was sitting there for 40 minutes and that they were calling my name the whole time, which I DID NOT hear over the music, and while conducting a crucial phone interview. Someone should have tapped my shoulder to let me know it was ready, but instead, they waited until it got soggy before they called my name at an appropriate level. After I got my pizza, a brown haired male worker said \"that pizzas been there for 40 minutes that's so disgusting and shriveled up\" to another coworker, and I HEARD HIM SAY IT. That made me lose my appetite! I asked them to warm it up again, and I ate it because I don't like to waste food. I have worked in the food industry in my past so I know it can be stressful and I had empathy. But that comment was unwarranted and so rude. When eating my pizza, the same old cranky white-haired man who I assumed to be the manager because of how old he was, was purposely trying to get near me while he was on the phone with someone and talked negatively about me to them! He was trying to get me to hear it, and that just put me in shock! NEVER dine in at this establishment, just do take out. I realized the reason why the majority of the staff is rude, is because management seems abusive and very, very petty. That manager was miserable and didn't even comp my meal or offer an apology at the least. I loathe this place. NEVER EAT INSIDE HERE. Someone please message me the number for the owner because I would truly like to speak with them. Your employees are rude, unhelpful, disrespectful, and lazy. They need to take more initiative, ESPECIALLY that manager. It would be unfortunate if he was the owner. With that attitude, I'm surprised this place doesn't have a lawsuit. I'm telling everyone I know to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"The pizzas are really tasty, however they are really cheap with the toppings :s
Also, I would NOT recommend  the artichokes, they taste like straight out of the can."}
{"text":"Za's is average, and it fascinates me as it's basically a pseudo-Italian factory of food.  The server could barely hide her snarl when I asked a question, but that's because they were serving about 3,000 people at once.  

Honestly, it felt like Henry Ford was making a Model T-ortelini.

I do like that you can customize salads and sandwiches and pasta--and that lemon cream sauce is DELICIOUS.

However, it has all the personality of a computer science grad student, and the old-style Italian movie poster lend very little charm.

Yet I know I'm going to be hungry at some point in the middle of the day and forget to bring my lunch.

And then Henry Ford's Italian Motor Cafe will be there for me."}
{"text":"The italian panini is so delicious! Also it's decently priced! Yum yum yum they also have sanpellegrino in every flavor which makes me the happiest person."}
{"text":"A word to the wise, don't get their salads. 2/2 on the times I have ordered salads, I got that green squishy stuff that you typically reject when making your own salads at home. Throwing vegetables (and sometimes fruit) in a bowl doesn't constitute a salad, folks. The pizza and pasta are ok though.

I am still giving it 3 stars because they have a good selection of iced tea and the extraordinarily eclectic ambiance. There is wall art of unique silhouettes like a cat dangling from a power line and a ninja on a bike upstairs which are modestly entertaining. But there is also a great little function where you can text in a song request and a monitor will play the song and video.


My choice?
Birthday Song - 2 Chainz ft. Kanye West.

3 stars."}
{"text":"I think it's a hit or miss. The food isn't as great as it was in the past and service is iffy. Combine that with the somewhat hard to read forms, and there's a potential mix for disaster. I love the idea of customizable meals, but their execution is mediocre. I came one night during a slow dinner with my bf and it was practically empty. After filling out the forms, we went to wait. Half an hour passed by and three other people who came after me got their food. Another guy took a pizza I thought was mine, but the kitchen guy shrugged and insisted it wasn't. My bf got his pizza after fifteen minutes and began to eat without me while I sat around waiting. I kept asking the kitchen staff who said to be patient and wait even though I was already waiting for half an hour. After finishing my milkshake, I was clearly annoyed and not hungry anymore. I considered demanding a refund when the manager? came up to me and asked me what I was waiting for. I told him a pizza and he went to look for it. He returned and told me they LOST my form somehow in a sea of four sheets of paper. I had to fill out another one and wait even longer. When my pizza came, I decided to eat it but it wasn't even that appetizing. The crust was thin and floppy and it looked like they haphazardly threw on the toppings.  Personally, I'm disappointed with Mia Za."}
{"text":"This place serves the tastiest spaghetti and marinara I've ever had: the noodles and sauce form a perfect combination and exude a strong yet comfortable flavor. While it's not gourmet, it's a step way, way above ordinary red-sauce Italian, and it'll satisfy even the strongest cravings for something zesty. The price is great, too.

Pretty much everything else on the menu---whether you customize it or not---will also be well prepared, well presented, and well received by your taste buds. Back in sophomore year of high school I had lunch here almost daily, and the only bad experience I can remember involved an unbearably spicy sauce that even my high-spice-tolerating Chinese friends agreed was over the top. (The chef may have just screwed up my particular order that day, but just to be safe, I'd stay away from any spicy option.)

On a final note, I've always been surprised at how quickly my order is ready, regardless of how crowded the restaurant is."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good but the manager here is very rude. Me and my friends came in for a pizza offer that they had and then  the manager was rude saying that our toppings choice was disgusting and the pizza would taste SOGGY and SHIT. He went on to shame us thrice saying the same thing in front of the public which literally killed my hunger. Later the toppings were also unevenly distributed and they forgot us to give the garlic bread. This was  the last time I'll visit this place again given the way they treat their customers."}
{"text":"I ordered simple traditional pizza margherita. Too sweet. As if they added sugar. Was soggy.

 Ordered a fountain drink. Cup they gave was dirty,  covered in some sticky substance (dried soda probably). Asked for a new cup.  That was dirty too. Gross.

This is not the Za's I remember from 2 years ago."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Walking into the restaurant is information overload - flashing signs with complicated juice ordering methods (I'll have 3-F?) and a menu with hundreds of lines of text. The entire process of ordering is time consuming and a bit confusing, in my opinion. 

The food itself is pretty unappetizing. I ordered the \"Asian\" menu item which was rotini noodles doused in a prepackaged ginger sauce. I added \"grilled\" chicken that was obviously anything but grilled; if I would have to guess I would say boiled. It also came with a cold and soggy piece of overly buttered garlic bread. I really love eating food and always finish my plate but this time I left half of the dish.

I'm leaving a 2 star rating because I think 1 star is reserved for when something horrible happens. However, I will not likely ever eat at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"if you order a combo here, one out of the two items they bring out will have something odd about it.  the buffalo chicken salad that i ordered came topped with this frighteningly chewy, wiry fried chicken that I did not want to put in my mouth.  My friend's apple gorgonzola salad was unappetizing with a plethora of iceberg lettuce.  

what does redeem za's is their selection of cheesecake factory goodies. good to keep in mind when you've had a bad day and you need something sinful to wash away the pain."}
{"text":"Besides my own personal anxiety at places where I have to fill out a paper about what I want to eat I am glad I picked Mia Za's for lunch. $5 Whole Wheat Wednesdays (pizzas or paninis) I ordered a whole wheat margherita pizza upon the recommendation of a co-worker. Normally stay away from margherita pizzas because they can be very bland. This one was not it was bursting with flavor! It was so good. Writing this review makes me want another one. The smoothies are also very tasty."}
{"text":"i agree with michelle K's review - who's Mia? this used to be just Za's! ('02-'05). the menu used to be simple b/w, and now it's all technicolored and double sided. they had plenty of options before, but now it's just overwhelming. i found myself hovering over the counter for way too long to fill out the order sheet, and afterwards, i wasn't sure if i'd missed anything...but yes, the food is about the same. it still tastes like dorm pasta, but good dorm pasta. although, the garlic bread isn't as tasty as before..hmmm?"}
{"text":"Za's (or Mia Za's or whatever they are calling it now) is one of those places that my fiancee and I always eat at when we visit U of I. It is definitely a solid eatery and one of the better options for food near campus. Personally, I am quite found of their white pizza, but honestly, any of the pizza or pasta dishes will do a good job of satiating your hunger. I recommend going on the weekends too. For some reason everyone goes there during the week for lunch, but then forgets about it on the weekends and there is no line at all."}
{"text":"It's cheap and gets the job done. Honestly if you want better pasta make it yourself, it really might be better."}
{"text":"Great food. Everything I've had has been excellent. It is all very simple, good for picky eaters, children, or just something quick and easy.

The smoothies are also very good, so it might be worth it to check out just for that."}
{"text":"One of the more original choices on Green Street in Campustown. I have been here as a regular during college years (2010s) and even before that as a prospective student. Za's is still a foundation of Campustown and will be for many years to come!"}
{"text":"I was so sad when I found out that Za's had burned down, but I'm glad that they have rebuilt. I love coming here because the service is friendly and the food is good. I come here when I need a quick bite to eat and they never fail to deliver. The ordering system is pretty straightforward. There are slips of paper with the menu items and you fill out what you want, such as proteins, veggies, etc. and give it to the cashier and voila...that's it. Quick and simple."}
{"text":"This place is okay only if you're really hungry between classes and don't have a lot of time to eat. However it's way too overpriced and they barely give you any food. I wouldn't eat here if I was able to just go home and make the food myself since they basically give you crappier versions of food you can make at home."}
{"text":"Wait, what did you say? You can custom make your own pasta dish? I'm in. Za's delicious italian selections have definitely made a name for themselves. Everyone love's Za's. It's inexpensive and it's good. The meals are made in a speedy process, so don't worry if it's crowded, it usually moves along just fine."}
{"text":"Mia Za's burned to the ground March 23, 2011."}
{"text":"Things I felt upon visiting Za's for the first time:
- overwhelmed at the number of options for lunch (pizza, pasta, paninis, and salads comprise your choices that you'll fill out on a custom form)
- impressed that there are 200 meals you can put together at less than 500 cals!
- comfortable in the spacious upstairs dining area
- healthy after eating my 1/2 salad-1/2 panini lunch combo
- elated I found somewhere that includes edamame in some of their salads

Unique lunch spot!"}
{"text":"This place is a favorite among U of I students! I came here for the first time yeeears ago on my violin teacher's recommendation (she is a  U of I graduate and had many fond memories of the place). I have been here several times since; I always try to stop by when I'm in the neighborhood. Za's has an excellent location near campus and a lot of other restaurants, apparel shops, ice cream/froyo places, etc. 

Eating here can be a bit overwhelming at first because there are SO many options! You fill out a sheet of paper to describe exactly what you want with options from salads, paninis, soups, pizzas, smoothies, and more. The big selling point of Za's is that you can customize your order to exactly how you want it with any toppings, sauces, or flavors--any way you want it! After ordering, you scoot on over to the pick-up counter and wait for your food to be ready. 

There are tables both upstairs and downstairs, so don't fret if every table is taken on the first floor. The stairs are kind of steep, so be careful as you walk up there with your food! I usually order the \"pick two\" option. My favorite is the broccoli cheddar soup with the \"lite panini,\" which can be customized exactly how you want it. The broccoli cheddar here is one of my favorites and has grated cheddar cheese on top. Yum. The food is by no means mind-blowing. Overall, this is your standard Italian lunch food with a few very above average options, like the soup. I also highly recommend trying the smoothies here (my drink of choice is the mango). They use real fruit and fruit juice!

Honestly, if you're in the area, you really can't miss a stop at Za's. 

Note: I last ate here before it burned down, so I can't speak to the quality of the original's replacement."}
{"text":"Za's took me back to the days of Radical Rye in Madison, WI.  Yes, one is a pizza/toasted sandwich place and the other was a sandwich place, but the binding tie is that you can customize your order on a little sheet of paper.  For someone who gets anxious at Starbucks trying to remember all the components that she has to say in the right order (lest she look like a dumbass), an uncomplicated, fill-in-the-bubbles order form is a god-send.

After wading through the many, MANY options for customizing my 'panini,' I handed in my order.  While the girl behind the counter was not particularly pleasant, it was lunch time on Green St., so I guess I can't fault her too much.  My sandwich came out pretty quickly, so no complaints there.  

Now, the sandwich.....heaven.  It's possible that I'm just really good at looking at ingredients and creating a delicious sandwich.  I'm not above tooting my own horn there.  But I think it's also possible that Za's just makes a mean toasted sandwich.  Since they serve it open-faced, I can't really go along with their calling it a 'panini.'  And it needs to be eaten with a knife and fork.  But it was delicious.  

In case you're curious (and I know you are), the tasty sandwich I had went like this: Veggie (no meat) panini with pesto mayo, mushrooms, red onions, artichokes, red peppers, spinach, and roma tomatoes, smothered with their gouda/mozzarella cheese.  I'm going to call it the Heather's Vegetarian Fake-Healthy Heart Attack Express.  That's going to catch on, just watch.

*P.S. A safety warning: I'm 95% sure my wallet was stolen out of my shoulder bag while upstairs at Za's.  So....practice good sense, which I didn't, and don't leave your bag unattended while you get utensils and napkins."}
{"text":"Mia Za's has an excellent variety of food. Unfortunately, none of it is outstanding. It'll fill you up for relatively cheap and you'll be okay with it, but you'll sort of regret not going somewhere else on Green. I've had pizzas and paninis and while some combinations of ingredients taste better than others, that single truth remains.

That does not, however, extend to their desserts. The tiramisu in particular is delicious. They also frequently have deals on Hooked that greatly improve the value proposition of its made-to-order Italian food.

Go there once or twice to see if you like it, but don't feel too bad if you missed out on it."}
{"text":"A big shout out to Ben and his counterpart for tackling a big group order immediately following opening after a wedding on Sunday. Just as good as these alumni remembered!"}
{"text":"I went in on the 31st to have a pasta which was 7.50 and they charged me 12.5$. I don't have a receipt but it on my bank account"}
{"text":"Eh this place is really a hit or miss. The first time I came I got a panini and it was pretty good. I got 4 toppings yet there was still barely anything on the bread. They were extremely skimpy on the toppings. My friends who got the pasta and pizza were very happy though. 
The second time I got a Caesar salad and tomato basil soup. Pretty simple order. My Caesar salad was incredibly soggy yet didn't really taste like anything. It tasted like they watered down their dressing..? My soup came lukewarm and wasn't anything special. 
This place is alright but really nothing special."}
{"text":"Always stop here when we are in Champaign.  We always stop here because the food never disappoints.  Got a huge salad, big pizza and a large pasta and have plenty of leftovers.  Food is always made fresh to order and the portion sizes are perfect."}
{"text":"Ingredients aren't fresh at all. I've tried pasta and the salad and none tasted good. The sandwiches are okay.  One thing i like about this place is that they Leave olive oil and vinegar out for dressing.  The service isn't friendly at all."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Mia Zas since 2010 the food quality and portion sizes have both gone down dramatically. The regular portion sizes also look different for dine in versus take out."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service. They have gluten free options. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Mia Za's but it's my absolute favorite. I love pairing up salads, soups, pizzas, and paninis. You can choose a classic or create-your-own of everything they sell. It's made to order and fresh! The vibe is so chill upstairs whenever dining in.
PS the portions are enough to get you full
PPS the smoothies are bomb!
You're welcome."}
{"text":"Okay Italian restaurant, although the portions are a bit small for the price. There are better places on Green St, although I do come here once in a while. Be on the lookout for deals on the Hooked app -- there are some pretty good ones around lunch and dinner times. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Champaign.

Love the way I can customize my pasta and salads.

Healthy, tasty and reasonable price."}
{"text":"Oh Za's, how I love thee.

It's changed a bit since I graduated, but it's always been one of my favorite places to get fresh-tasting, delicious food on Green Street.  Seriously, where else would you go?  I've been a fan for years.

I have always loved their pastas the best, and they've really expanded the options. Last time I went, I got multigrain rotini with pesto and veggies.  It felt really healthy and light, even though it was a sizable portion.  The huge and delicious piece of garlic bread did kind of counteract the \"light\" feeling, however...  I also had one of their delicious smoothies, and I have never gone wrong by ordering any of their infinite combos.  Anything with mango in it is an automatic favorite of mine!

Yeah, it's not gourmet, but for an inexpensive lunch that isn't fast food or a chain place, it's definitely the best you can get in Champaign.  And oh, the nostalgia factor..."}
{"text":"nommmmmmmmmm. This place is awesome. I have to admit, the first time I came in, I was slightly overwhelmed by the menu cards that you have to fill out.. only because there's so many options and I wanted them all.  The girl at the register must have known I was clueless/overwhelmed/starved bc she offered a few suggestions. I ultimately went with chicken alfredo with broccoli.  It was delicious.  I suck at trying new things when I find something I like, so I have yet to order anything else. Well except the broccoli cheddar soup. That's also really good. I'm pretty picky when it comes to my soup too.. it's not too watery or salty. Good job Zas.  My friends have all been pretty satisfied too and they tend to branch out a lot more than I do.

Overall, I'd say this place is pretty underrated. I'm kind of bummed I discovered how awesome it is towards the end of my college career because it would have fixed a lot of those \"ugh its saturday i'm too lazy to make food\" kinds of days."}
{"text":"Update: since I was last here, they've added two huge tv screens in the entrance area, opened up the food prep area so you can see your food being made, and changed their order forms a little.
Things that happened when I was there on this particular occasion: the \"power mix\" greens included the very bottom of a romaine head (the part you don't wanna eat), most of the seating was closed to people eating alone, and my food came out quick with smiles and accuracy."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed being the boss of my sauce and picking out exactly what pasta i wanted. They give you options of creating your own, picking one from their menu, or other customer's creations. what a great way to think outside the box.

The service was prompt and portions were well worth it."}
{"text":"Always my favorite place to go when I am on campus. Food is always clean and fresh. The variety of pizzas, pastas and sandwiches will satisfy anyone's appetite. Service is also always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I always come to Mia Za's for their 5$ large pizza or create your own pasta deal. I always get the buffalo chicken and sun dried tomatoes! My absolute favorite toppings!!! Everyone here welcomes you with a smile and their staff is always so nice. Strongly recommend the pesto pasta with the two toppings i suggested along with spinach, zucchini and broccoli!!!"}
{"text":"Dropped by here before my flight back home and got the garlic pesto pizza without cheese and combination of my favorite veggies. I dropped by here after walking past many closed shops and walking in. The worker was kind enough to come around the table and help me out with the vegan options.

The crust was a bit slightly soggier than I've liked (could be due to my choices of toppings) but the pizza was tasteful and made within 5-6 minutes. I'll definitely return to try the pasta dishes because I cannot recall how good it was when I dropped by last year. :)"}
{"text":"\"Mia Za's\"?  The hell?  I'm pretty sure that when I was in college ('03-'07), this place was just plain old \"Za's.\"  But that was back in the DAY, back when shit was REAL.

It's true, this place has no personality, but the food is serviceable and I like building my own pizza/salad/sandwich/pasta dish.  The pizza crust is super-thin and crispy, and I like that the salads are ENORMOUS.  The pasta...I could live without.  I don't know why, but it kind of reminded me of pasta they might serve in the dorms.  GOOD dorm pasta, yes, but still dorm pasta.  Maybe that makes sense only in my head?"}
{"text":"Normally I'd dock one star for being a bit overpriced, but I actually think Za's deserves all five. Everything I've ever had in my 4 years in Champaign was delicious. Dessert, pizza, pasta, buffalo chicken salad, I could pretty much name everything on the menu and not have one bad thing to say. Love the ambiance here too - especially the upstairs! Great for pick-up or even a nice dinner when you don't want to spring for a more formal sit-down place."}
{"text":"Not to be confused with Za's Italian Cafe, but there are a bunch of similarities. This establishment features customizable options and I gotta say that the food they give you here is significantly less than what you would get at Za's. There's room to eat upstairs and I would recommend it. Eating downstairs means that you have to deal with customers who are constantly writing down their orders on the railings in very close proximity to you."}
{"text":"Ugh, what happened to Mia Za's? It used to be a great place to go to for a quick, customized lunch. Now the pasta is obviously frozen, portions are small, Alfredo sauce almost flaky. The amount of meat they give you is lackluster and the salad dressing is weirdly fake-tasting. 
Some pros are: big and roomy. Convenient location. Very customizable. 
I used to go often. Now I go never. Even with their price tag, it's not worth it. If you want cheap, quick food, do Chinese. Do McDonalds."}
{"text":"Serious health issues!

Well, it used to be a good place for a quick lunch on campus. But now, errrrr. My friend and I have noticed many times that the cashier prepares the bread and stuff without wearing gloves, in the middle of getting cash and cards from people. TOO DIRTY HANDS. We kept telling them about this issue and all the time they said : yeah you are right, and kept doing the same thing! 
Today we went there for lunch and we saw the same thing, cashier preparing food with bare dirty hands. When my friend wanted to order, he told the cashier and she just went and took the pizza bread with her hands in front of us! We tried to be calm and waited for our food. And guess what we got! My friend got his pizza with the smallest amount of cheese and toppings in the world! The whole thing was just a big bread! 
He got angry and asked the staff where their boss is. The old guy there said she is out of town and will be back on Wednesday. Well! And he did not accept that the staff use their bare hands to prepare food and showed us tongs and said they always use this! Well, we have never seen them use the tongs! 

I don't recommend going to this place anymore! NOT AT ALL! You will get dirty food, small small portions, zero-cheese-pizza and almost no topping!"}
{"text":"I really like Za's, specifically the one on campus (there are two other Champaign locations). I find the food is always good and there is always a lunch or seasonal special e.g. summer on a Tuesday is $5 Create Your own Pasta/Pizza/Panini, free iced tea, and free chocolate strawberries. That's an entire meal for $5 and tax. Portions are always large (I usually pick 2: salad and pasta).
There is plenty of seating (just head upstairs if you don't like sitting close to people or have more than a party of 2). I love the plastic cups that you can take and bring back for cheeper drinks (think Starbucks or Duckin' Donuts without the expensive coffee) and the service is always friendly. Ordering can be a little confusing the first time (which sheet is for the pasta!?) but someone is happy to help you out and ask all the important questions (artichokes? do you like olives? do you want pasta? do you like cheese?). Overall, this places is fairly inexpensive, friendly, clean, and it's always open, even in those strange summer months when no one is around."}
{"text":"Another establishment I frequented quite a bit while @ the U of I.  I loved creating my own pasta dish with fresh veggies and delicious sauces, fresh parmesan and a HUGE piece of garlic bread.  It was very reasonably priced and the upstairs dining area is very nice.  I took my parents here many times during moms and dads weekends and they also fell in love with Za's...you cannot go wrong!  It does get SUPER crowded during lunchtime, so go at an off time if you want to just waltz right in...I need to go back and visit just to get me some Za's!"}
{"text":"The food at this quick restaurant is a hearty meal.  I'm VERY full after eating here.  I order penne in creamy marinara with spinach.  The food is delicious, especially the garlic bread that comes with the pasta.  I give Za's 4 out of 5 stars because the food quality is inconsistent.  Some days that food is warm and some days it is cold.  Sometimes my plate is filled with food, other times there isn't enough food to get full.  Some days the sauce to pasta ratio is perfect and sometimes I cannot even see the sauce on my pasta."}
{"text":"Better than the Mia Za's in Ann Arbor (though that's not saying much). I am tempted to give this place on two stars though, because the slice of cheesecake I ordered was FROZEN and ICY and took too long to thaw out."}
{"text":"I ordered Mia Za's for delivery, upon getting my salad it had the incorrect toppings I ordered - very small portion, had a hair in it and I received no straw with my order when I ordered a smoothie. Overall, disappointed being as the first time I've ordered from here."}
{"text":"I hope this rating can change the next time I go in... went for the 5$ 5 topping pizza deal. There were two workers and it was moderately busy. We got two pizzas. My first complaint was that one of the girls looked like she was in such a bad mood. When I told her thank you she didn't even respond. Didnt even look at me. The next problem was she left off like most of the toppings we asked for on the second pizza. I don't know what the problem was but it wasn't crazy busy for the bad service or messed up order..."}
{"text":"A couple people have said it best, this place has no personality. But does that mean it doesn't have yummy food? Nope! Totally delightful. Went here last night before the dinner rush at around 4 pm. It's one of those places where they give you a sheet of paper with predetermined options on it OR the option to create your own pizza, pasta, salad, or sandwich. 

Most of the people working the counter are just college students and therefore not necessarily skilled in helping you create awesome meals. After staring at the overwhelming menu for a little while I ended up creating my own pizza. I had garlic marinara sauce with a feta/mozzarella mix topped with red onions, olives, and sun dried tomatoes. It was kick-ass! I ate (most) of the whole thing. I did give away some of it because it was too good not to share. I had been to this place a few years ago (before it burnt down and was rebuilt) and I remember having something delicious then, too! I believe I created a pasta that time.

I really had minimal interaction with staff, but everyone seemed pleasant when I did need them to place the order. They don't really \"wait\" on you because it's seat yourself, leave your dishes at the table. Really all you're doing is ordering at a counter; kind of like a more fancy, involved, delicious subway concept."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
I am glad that I am back by Za's after moving back to Champaign. This was my favorite place to eat at on campus when I was a medical student. Now that I am back I have found out that there are multiple locations which works out well. The prices are actually cheaper than when I was here for college due to a modification in the menu. For the pasta you get to select from multiple types and sauces with 4 toppings for 5 dollars. The premium protein items i.e shrimp, meatballs, chicken will run you a dollar more each. The food is prepared quickly, however I don't know if they changed it now to use a convection oven/microwave to nuke your toppings which is one down side. This is then added to a pan with the sauce and served quickly. You also get a nice piece of garlic bread. All and all this is better than McD and for the same price. There are also other options such as pizza, salads, sandwiches etc. I have never strayed from the pasta

Pro: inexpensive, quick, large portions

Cons: microwaved toppings (i guess you get what you pay for)

Hidden gem:
Sign up for the perka app. You need to check in and tell the cashier so they can give you the punch to earn free food. I did not realize this and ended up not getting my first check-in. You can't just check-in which makes sense or people would abuse the system"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good! Service was quick and friendly. There was a variety of options to satisfy everyone's taste."}
{"text":"My favourite place on campus, Za's is always the place to go when we can't decide where to go, because ultimately everyone says yes to Za's! Their paninis, pizzas, sandwiches, and pasta, everything's great. I was very sad when this place burned down, it took an year, but its back and as good as ever. Upstairs is great to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Still good food like before the fire, but the salads seem smaller. The new modern style totally ruined the comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ate here twice in the past 2 days. What a nice surprise find in a college town. All fresh ingredients and you can customize your order fully. We had salads, pizzas, panini. Everything was delicious and came out quickly. Wish we had one of these at home!"}
