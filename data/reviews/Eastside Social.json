{"text":"Went here with 5 friends tonight.  Service was great at first but came to a standstill by the end of the meal.  The place became quite busy for a Tuesday night.   We were informed that they cannot accommodate 6 people on the patio - FYI.   Cheque took forever to receive and was left on our table without any eye contact or comment.   However, the food was really, really  good.   Octopus was delicious, fish tacos was fried and tasty, the lobster pasta special was lovely and the tenderloin was also well received.   The $1 Oyster specials on Tuesday were a fine value.   Otherwise, portions were a little small vs. the price.     Draft Beer and Cider is reasonable at $7.50-$8 with a nice, small selection.  Wine is a little bit silly priced at $14 for 5oz for the cheapest red.  Would have rated 4 star review if the service hadn't dropped off (my friend, after seeing the size of the octopus portion -which came with no side - wanted to order a clam chowder but the server didn't come back until way after everyone had finished their meal).   This might have been a 5 star review if service had been top-notch and prices vs. portions were a little more reasonable."}
{"text":"We have very much enjoyed the \"gentrification\" of our \"Leslieville \" neighbourhood  in the past few years. Added to this are the new bars and restaurants that have opened on Queen Street East making the area a \"go to\" dining destination. With the recent opening of \"Eastside Social\" our dreams have come true ! This place has it all ! Great food, friendly, professional service and a most \"sympatico\" , laid back atmosphere. We have tried most of the menu items and some of their \"delish\" cocktails. We highly recommend this place to anyone who may enjoy the small plates menu for sharing. Our only fear is that it's' popularity may increase to the point where it will become difficult to get a seat ! All good ! We will be back ! Congratulations !  Arthur"}
{"text":"Okay. So, since my first visit, Eastside is my brain's default choice. Sitting at the bar's my preferred locale. Especially at the seats \"behind\" the bar; best in the house... Have eaten in the dining room and on the patio as well (fireplace is a nice touch, and will be great in the coming months). But, prefer the bar. For drinks and eats. Can't go to Eastside without an order of the Fish Tacos. Grilled Flank Steak's totally tasty too. Ditto Grilled Octopus. And oyster hours on Tues and Weds... I'm in! Service is solid. One evening I'd ordered a half-dozen oysters to start. When they arrived, I noticed the half-dozen was five. I pointed out to my server that something was missing from my plate. She quickly and apologetically corrected the  error... by making another. When she returned there were seven oysters on the plate. I joked it was wrong again... nice to over-correct. I appreciated the gesture, and got busy with my \"bakers\" half-dozen. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Just had a few beers at this place last night and some awesome sides.  The Deviled eggs are killer and the poutine ( I'm kinda of poutine nut!) was the most original east cost take I have ever seen. ( it came in a Yorkshire pudding). I have been to a few bars in Leslieville but atmosphere here is just like the bars in Nova Scotia. Thanks for a great time."}
{"text":"So happy to have the experience.  Food: very good Service: excellent  Ambiance: good  It was a full house on a Monday night (1/2 price on any bottle of wine on their entire wine list). Most restaurants give you bread to start, here you have to order it but so worth it. I do like the fact that they offer not just seafood, they also of a chicken and a beef dish for the non seafood lovers.  Final cost for 2 appetizers, 2 main courses, 1 dessert, 3 glasses of wine, and 1 tea...$115.   Value: very good"}
{"text":"The place had great atmosphere and even better food.  The food was all quick to come, and incredibly delicious.  Standouts were the fish tacos, calamari and scallop ceviche."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving Eastside Social a 5 star rating is because it's not an option to give them a perfect 10!  My little family and I live in TO and dining out amongst the amazing selection Toronto has, is a significant part of our life.  We ordered the oysters (kusshi were the feature when we visited on 14Jan17) calamari, lobster bacon croquettes (our fav), flank steak and herbed frites.  With beer and cocktail, juice for the little lad, this was the perfect amount for my husband, I and our 6yr old experienced diner.  All this was finished with a roasted plum tart which our server so fittingly described as \"it tastes like Christmas\".  Everything was prepared perfectly, not a criticism to say.  But the element that blew this whole experience over the top in our books was the service.  I'm only sorry I didn't get anyone's names.  When we arrived, we were greeted with an enthusiastic young gent who described the night's features and gave us first timers advice on ordering to share.  Next our main server was truly a master at his art.  He tended to us with such enthusiasm and warmth, despite having a full house, it felt like we were visiting with an old friend.  By the end of the night, we left with a hug!  It's clear he is not only excellent at what he does, but shares his personal flare of enthusiasm that will surely keep customers coming back to Eastside.  A week later and we're still talking about it...he's probably destroyed us for other restos!  This was our first visit, definitely not our last and next time, we'll get names."}
{"text":"First off , the staff at East Side Social are so much fun! its nice to go into a sit down restaurant these days and have the staff genuinely happy. I am not talking about staff having to wear \" 37 pieces of flare\" kind of happy......legitimately happy workers.   This happiness comes through in the food. The cooks are making products that they are proud of and the servers bring it to the table with a confidence that you will love the meal.   The skate schnitzel is awesome as is the pate...I cant wait to go back and try more. Well done!"}
{"text":"Good food and service - back patio, small but comfortable.  Fair prices for this type of establishment/cuisine.  Had a good time."}
{"text":"I went back to Eastside social and I'm very glad I did. The second time I went there to give them another chance, just because I'm in that part of town often, I called before and booked a table for two on a Thursday night. The food was fantastic and the win was amazing. The prices are steep, but that seems to be the new norm in town. The staff were very friendly, they helped us with finding this one wine that they had on their list and we fell in love with. So I kept going back there every month or so and the bartender, sadly I don't know her name but she is very lovely, remembered me to my surprise!!!  So a couple of weeks ago I had some visitors from Dubai and I decided to take them there. They were shortstaffed so the owner was there helping serve people. Let me tell you he was great he was honest and upfront he told us that there was going to be delays in service because they were shortstaffed. I truly appreciate that kind of honesty. Because this sort of thing can happen to any restaurant and it's not their fault obviously, but most places would just pretend like nothings wrong and expect the patrons to put up with it. But these guys were actually honest and upfront which in turn translates into the patrons being understanding of the situation.  Did I say most dishes are amazing? My most favourite one is the grilled octopus and the one I was talking about is Montelpelchiano!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time at Eastside Social last night with my fiancé. We were walking down Queen East and happened to stumble upon the restaurant and went in on a whim.  The servers were very busy when we arrived, so we didn't get greeted or sat immediately. To be honest, we didn't really notice or mind and we've both worked in the restaurant industry, so we completely understood. They were very apologetic and accommodating. The gentleman who hosted us showed us the great back patio, but we ended up sitting inside. He let us sit at a four top even though there was only the two of us. Our server, a different guy, was also super nice, as well. Very friendly and charming, knew the menu very well, had great recommendations. We were incredibly impressed by the service we received. It's hard to find a place that has this sort of hospitality nowadays!   Food-wise we had skate schnitzel, which came highly recommended by our server. Holy smokes was it ever delicious. The side potato salad was the best I've had. We also ordered devilled eggs and I had the \"Salty Dog\" cocktail. Everything was above and beyond what we'd expected. We'll definitely be back!  UPDATE: We loved Eastside Social so much, that we actually had our wedding dinner there in September 2015! It was very small and casual - we simply made a reservation and left it at that. It was low-key and top notch quality. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food, really a delight all around.  We had an oyster appetizer (a decent special on oysters Tuesday and Wednesday I believe), a few glasses of wine, and mains. I can't remember what we had... but it was GREAT.  The ambiance is terrific, and despite being swamped (I could see how quickly the dinner service filled up) the owner, and 2 different waiters all came by appropriately frequently to check up on us.  I'm a fan, and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"This place is really good. They specialize in fresh seafood. It's on the more expensive side, but not crazy. Everything I've tried here has been delicious. They have a nice back patio and laid back vibe. The inside is nice and cozy."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner at Eastside Social tonight!  Skate schnitzel, surf & turf tacos and some comfort high end hamburger helper...all wonderful and good for the whole family!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here recently were unfortunately very disappointed. Steak was chewy and overcooked, tacos were soggy, muscles were rubbery and overcooked as well and the staff wasn't very attentive.   It's a shame because the restaurant is beautiful, has a great vibe and good drinks."}
{"text":"Great seafood. Very nice hostess. Terrible dessert (got the overpriced ice cream sandwich which was tiny and hard as a rock). Would have given this place at least a 3.5/5 if the server wasn't so neglectful and rude to our table. Despite the delicious seafood, wouldn't go back to this place."}
{"text":"The food is truly fantastic.  I came thinking I would try the highly reviewed croquets but was easily influenced to follow my opening of oysters with the most unique and tasty clam chowder I have ever tasted (and I have tasted many).  The mussels in linguine was delicious and used most of my bread to just soak up the amazing sauce.  Definitely will come back and bring more to share in the cool ambience and great food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service, great decor, affordable gem in Leslieville. Clam chowder, cod balls, homemade bread and Yorkshire pudding poutine are my faves so far.  Quaint, calm, laid back, open kitchen concept, bar seating or dining room side, your choice. Good wine and beer selection."}
{"text":"Love this place - great food, good wine, fabulous service. It can get a bit loud but it's because everyone is having fun! I also love their molasses bread. It's worth the order - good with butter but also excellent for sopping up leftover sauce."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio on  A warm summer night. Really pleasant.  My partner has  Skate Scalloped. It was a generous portion and really tasty. Service was good and prices typical for Leslieville."}
{"text":"Along with the classic items on a brunch menu, the less-ordinary ones are very imaginative!  I ordered the roasted vegetable and hummous salad with roasted cauliflower, ratatouille, hummus, honey, crispy onion. The contrasts in flavours (salty lemony hummous next to sweet honey, crunchy simple cauliflower with wet and soft ratatouille) is interesting, and as demonstrated in this dish, very healthy. Lovely academic den-ish atmosphere, perfect to spend a rainy afternoon.  Was surprisingly not busy around noon when we came for brunch on a Sunday (ended up coming here because another- cheaper- brunch diner was full due to impending storms and no patio seating because of it). Other items ordered were as fresh and delicious, if more ordinary, which is fine. Slightly more expensive than other brunch places, but worth it."}
{"text":"I live in the area, and have heard this place was amazing for a long time, and we often go to their sister restaurant, The Thirsty Duck. Finally, we decided to come here tonight. Th main restaurant was booked and I didn't make a reservation (make a note for next time), but we sat at the bar and had a blast. First, the staff here are amazing. All of them. We had a clear view of the kitchen and those guys were working hard as a team, but also enjoying themselves. Wonderful vibe here, too. Great food, but casual, so if, like us, you decide at the end of a hard day you deserve a break and are in your yoga pants? No problem! Now. The food. Really great. Loved their oysters. My husband had the clam chowder and OH MY, good. The bread you can order as an appetizer was BEYOND HEAVEN. My downfall for sure. My husband's pasta of the day and my mussels were both solid. The cocktails are expertly mixed, and the wine list is good as well. We had such a good time, on a cold, dark night. And for sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"Terrific place!! We started with the deviled eggs, the amazing salt cods balls, then went on to the surf and turf tacos, the yummy hamburger helper and the fantastic skate schnitzel. Topped off with blueberry grunt. Only complaint was the blueberry grunt should be a touch jucier. All in all, we loved it. And the service was superior. Despite being crazy busy we never felt ignored. Well done."}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service. I highly recommend the grilled octopus - you'll end up coming back just for that dish alone. The cocktails are outstanding here. After dinner, saunter down one block west to it's \"sister\" pub, The Thirsty Duck for an after dinner drink!"}
{"text":"It's great to see that Riverdale is upping its game gastronomically with a very unique place like this.  We had a great meal and a great evening here.  Our waiter was a the perfect blend of friendly, wry, efficient and unobtrusive. The appetizers were exceptional.  Clams were simply seasoned, delicious and meaty.  The smoked trout and parsnip cake was the best fish cake I ever had (and now that I think of it, I've tried way too many fish cakes in my life. Hmmm.)   The missing star is deducted because the mains were a bit less interesting than the first course options and far fewer in selection.  Pasta with salmon included well made and perfectly cooked noodles, but the fish was indiscernible from salmon from a can.  The breading on breaded skate seemed to diminish the subtle flavours of the fish.  I think a light sauce would have been a better approach.  With a table of four, we really couldn't find four different main options - partly because we had a late seating and a few items were sold out before we sat down. But also the menu itself seems a bit short on main options. A few more first course options and you could get away without mains entirely.    The restaurant is loud enough that you'll need to project your voice to be heard across your table. However, it's not booming music, it's loud with people enjoying themselves! So despite my usual low tolerance for loud restaurants, we found it comfortable here and lingered long after our meal.  Fish tacos seems like the way to go.  Although we didn't get to try them, they look great.  I look forward to eating here again someday.  Avoid taking reservations after 8pm if you want to experience the full line up."}
{"text":"Nice to see a restaurant focuses on seafood in Leslieville. We came for dinner after hearing about the hype. The atmosphere was casual, and it could be loud because everyone was so happy. Service was excellent. Our server was terrific, she was attentive and we had good conversation. If I am only rating service it would get a 4*.  Food, don't get me wrong, they were delicious, but way OVER-PRICED. We ordered a whole sea bream in banana leave (patarashca) at market price. The fish was about a pound (or a bit less - it wasn't big). It was delicious, tender, and fresh. When the bill came, the fish came to a gasping $45! I've never had fish more expensive than this, not even cod, for a pound. I estimated a sea bream is around $10-15 per pound at the fish monger, so the mark up was ridiculous. Lesson learned: ask how much is market fare before ordering."}
{"text":"It was very loud but overall decent experience, could be just the guys beside us Had the anchovies crust type dish, very light but great flavor  Olives were super warm and nicely marinated Huge portion of fries, the sauce wasnt the best to compliment them Fish tacos were good"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service but the chairs were a bit uncomfortable and the food seems a bit too expensive with few exceptions...the entrance area was packed with staff just standing around most of the time, which might explain the high prices."}
{"text":"Lovely, Lovely Evening!  How often is it when every aspect of an evening out meets all the criteria that diners are looking for?  It's rare and this place comes through in spades.  This was my first visit to Eastside Social.  The place itself is charming and  sophisticated, but has that down to earth East Coast feel about it.  The lighting is just so that it creates an aura of calm.   After looking over the menu, my friend and I chose the following.  For starters, the  salt cod balls ... mushrooms on toast... sea salt & herb fries... then for the mains, Hamburger Helper ( wild boar & rapini ) and a Kale salad.  Our waiter Russell, in the nicest possible way, told us that we were ordering too much food.  That the portions were very large.  So, we removed the cod balls and the herb fries.  Guess what.  He was right and more to the point, I don't think I have ever had any waiter actually looking out for my vested interests like that.  The timing of bringing out the dishes was impeccable.  Like a symphony.  Our evening lasted 2 3/4 hours.  Our waiter... I don't know if words can convey how good he was.  I guess it's a professional instinct for knowing just when to come over and when not to and always being solicitous.   The food?  It was excellent.  Period!    Lastly, I am almost embarrassed to say what this evening cost along with 2 glasses of wine,  dessert  and tip.  Still under $100.00   For this kind of ambiance, service, and quality of food?   It can't last forever."}
{"text":"Went for our4th time last night. Previous 3 times were great but something changed. The menu is different. The plates are different. It used to be down to earth East Coast, it feels like they're trying to be \"Toronto\" now. The chowder- previously perfect, is now bland and soupy. My main- the skate schnitzel - previously a hit was flavourless. Did they run out of herbs and spices?   Now the kicker... We didn't get our food for an HOUR after we were seated. When i asked the waiter he said, \"yes there is a 25 min waiting time for food.\" No apology. No explanation. Not even acknowledgement we had been sitting with empty drinks and water glasses.   Sadly crossing off this one from our neighbourhood round. Let me know when you guys get your act back together."}
{"text":"We had a great meal here last night even though they were slammed and short on staff. The service was attentive and friendly to the right degree.   Homemade molasses bread is dense, sweet and just like East Coast style as is the chowder. We ordered a variety of items at our table and nobody was disappointed. They cook the seafood very skilfully - and importantly there is not a lot of garlic being flung into everything. The flavours are nice and subtle. the Kung Pao style cauliflower appetizer was especially delicious. definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food and cute ambiance. Loved the fish tacos and chowder!! The tacos had amazing fish which was perfectly done; not oily and perfectly fresh. The chowder had a nice mix and the bacon was a great touch. So delicious. Boyfriend had the pasta special: orecchiette pasta with braised beef ragu. That was equally delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a casual, relaxed place that is nice for dates and catching up with old friends. Definitely a great spot for seafood. The service was good. Our waiter was bubbly, energetic and provided honest recommendations. The restaurant was fairly busy so the service was not as fast but there was only 1 waiter at the time so it's understandable. We went there in the summertime so ate on the patio. It's a small establishment with an intimate feel. The food took a long time to come out but there were only one or two chefs at the back so we weren't surprised. The menu and cuisine is simple but still effective. You get decent portions for your money and quality ingredients. Don't expect huge portions of food..this isn't your local \"boys night out sports bar pub n grub\" okay ;). Would not recommend this restaurant/bar for big groups. The decor/ambience is minimalistic and just as simple as their menu but still aesthetically pleasing. If you're the foodie photo taker type you'll definitely be able to snap some nice shots. Personally, I find this simple classic style to be a bit elegant and romantic. Yup I dig it! The grilled octopus was super delicious. Just thinking about it right now if making my mouth water."}
{"text":"We were able to get a reservation for Saturday night at 18:30 thanks to someone cancelling and it sure was worth it. The decor is an eclectic mix of post war and edgy, almost industrial. We loved that.  The menu is uncluttered. I never like places which try and be \"all things to all people\", so figure on a resto-bar which serves up amazing seafood dishes to tapas sized appies. I always gauge my reviews on several things as I mentioned earlier - the food (of course); the menu; the wait staff and the decor. It is not often that you can find a place which gets it right on all of my criteria and this place sure does.  Everyone has previously reviewed the fish tacos and the octopus, so I order the fish tacos. OUTSTANDING dish. An interesting and delicate dish with complex flavors which are layered between the apple slaw and aioli. It was not the usual oily battered fish, thrown into a taco with whatever was available, but a truly thought out creation making it a local favorite.  Bonnie (wifus-maximus), had the muscles and, again, a delight for the senses.  The one thing which stands out at Eastside Social, is how everyone working there, seems to want to be there. They are totally engaged into your experience without hovering over you. I alway like to meet the owner and Sherry was just a wonderful person. When I told her how much I enjoyed the fish-tacos, she playfully responded that \"they are so popular, that they help pay the rent\".  Honestly, the only disappointment (if you want to call it that), was that we could not order the Lobster-Bacon Croquettes as they had sold out. Come on! I mean Lobster-Bacon Croquettes! How yummy does that sound? We were not surprised and need to make sure that we ask them to put some aside for us next time. The mere sound of that combo, had all the mouths of our party of six, watering.  Delivery was very reasonable from ordering to arrival at the table. Our friends ordered the Fish Cakes and we all had the plum tart with coffee for desert.  What I really want to leave as an impression, is about the balance of flavor. So many restaurants mask bad food with a lot of spices, whereby you cannot actually detect the fish or the fruit you are ingesting. This place takes an inordinate attention to the detail of the flavor. Everything seems to be designed around bring that out. From your appy or entre to your desert, there always seems to be a sense of balance where when you bight into it, you want to take a moment to let all your senses kick into the different layers of flavors.  Our man Martin was terrific. A point I always make is to ask our waiter's name. I hate the \"hey you\" approach many people have and when they are great, I make a point of letting the manager know this. Martin and the entire team function as a aunt and helped each other out, another sign of a great restaurant.  Sherry, we are DEFINITELY coming back and hoping the Lobster-Bacon Croquettes will be on the menu again :-)"}
{"text":"People may rave about dinner service in this latest new joint in the ever-changing Leslieville restaurant/brunch scene. But although the menu offerings are the same no matter what time it is, I find the experience at Eastside Social seems quite underrated compared to other places around here you and most others could go to for a weekend daytime stomach fill. Get past the emptiness; let's get nautical, nautical.  Nothing's fishy about it; the quaint nautical themed decor everywhere anchors the restaurant's emphasis on light seafood and Maritime-themed fare, without making you feel like it's a seafood restaurant-great for those like myself who aren't big on choking on oysters, as well as those that do. Arrrrg, Eastside certainly makes for a decent choice for a classy date night meal setting, because who the hell wants to go to a greasy dump seafood joint for a date?  The freshly smoked trout (smoked in-house) puts all those supermarket frozen smoked salmon stuff to shame and is a must-have for any smoked fish fan-the flavours are just smokin' fresh and heavenly! The Yorkshire pudding poutine ($15) was fun to eat (a demi-glace is used in place of the requisite gravy, offering an different kind of beefiness). Service was very warm, all that is missing is more people to fill the seats on a Sunday afternoon.  {TTC: take the 72 bus or the 501-2-3 to Queen/Carlaw}"}
{"text":"There's been a lot of hype about Eastside Social but I was definitely a little skeptical seeing the menu items from the initial reviews (Torontolife, BlogTO) and the pricing associated with it. I've come to learn that sharing plates are generally a little bit more expensive for the portion size so you really have to appreciate the flavours, the people you're with and hope you're getting an overall great experience.  When I walked in just after 6pm, I was greeted by really friendly people and I was surprised that the place was empty, hearing that reservations have been filling up quite often and it was hard to get a seat. However, I got my table of choice, by the giant window, with the opportunity to people watch :)  After my guests arrived, we all ordered glasses of wine.. which showed up in rather odd little cups- the kind that your kids would drink grape juice out of, or very small glasses of chocolate milk at a breakfast restaurant (from my recollection of working at one). Very unconventional...  We ordered a few items to eat and share -  - Devilled Eggs -  Sea Bream Ceviche w. Taro Chips - Market Salad w. Smoked Trout - Cod Fritters w. two types of sauces - Surf & Turf Tacos  I didn't get to try the devilled eggs, but I was told that compared to the ones at County Snack Bar, this really didn't compare. I'm a pretty big fan of Tacos and didn't get to try these either... but no one really raved / talked about them after eating them, which is never a good sign.  I had the Market Salad w. Smoked Trout and was pretty disappointed. The Smoked Trout was extremely salty and was really dried out like it was over smoked, to be honest. The pieces of trout was minimal, and within the salad, there were pieces of pepper that I was NOT ready for... so be aware of the spice. The light pieces of \"pepper\" are not what they seem. Overall, a dish full of unpleasant surprises. The Cod Fritters were dry, and did not have much flavour at all... another subpar dish.  We could not stress enough how much we didn't want Cilantro in our dishes - one of our guests really did not enjoy it and even the slightest bit would lead to avoidance. Yet when the ceviche came out, at first sight, she noticed it and questioned whether there was CILANTRO!? And the waitress thought for a second and claimed.. yes there may be a slight bit..... I don't know how much this was stressed so the lack of detail was extremely off pudding. There was no effort to make this right. I was okay with eating it and thoroughly have really enjoyed ceviche.... but this was way too tart from the overwhelming amount of grapefruit. There was nothing to balance out the sourness of flavours, and the hardness of the taro chips did not help.  After writing this review.... I've changed my rating from 3 to 2 stars. Our friends paid for the meal and I'm sure it wasn't cheap so I hope they enjoyed our company, because I enjoyed theirs much more than I enjoyed the overall meal.  Sadness :("}
{"text":"IT'S PATIO SEASON!!  Came for dinner on a weekday with my boyfriend. At first we thought the restaurant was totally empty, but lo and behold, the patio was revealed to us in the back and was pretty much packed.   We scored a corner seat and was given water promptly (it was pretty much filled the whole night).  The patio is covered with umbrellas and fenced up. Absolutely beautiful on a summer evening (even better with some summery drinks).  We got:  POACHED PEAR WITH PROSCIUTTO AND GRILLED HALLOUMI (15.00)  Picked Currents with Port and Prosecco Reduction  *mwah* So decadent! I wasn't feeling too hungry so this was all mine and you get 3 pieces with it. I would say it's a bit pricey for what you're getting, but hell it's good.   FISH TACOS (13.00 + Add extra taco 6.00) Cabbage & Apple Slaw, Chipotle Aioli  2 tacos, which are both sooooooo good. Yes I've been to Seven Lives. I would say these tacos are pretty much on par.   The service was great; servers attentive and personable.   Overall, might stop by this place again to try their other dishes. It's like fancy/pricey tapas type food w/o the pretentiousness."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place but fell short with service and the entrees. The bartender had no personality and was quite brusque, clearly the lady who sat beside us also wasn't impressed. Our Server forgot our fries, which I know happens but didn't feel like she really cared or wanted to do anything to redeem the small mishap.   When it comes to food, Monday half price wine and $2 oyster were a steal but the entrees lacked luster and taste. Chowder was good, great consistency and flavorful. My fish taco was mushy and his fish special wasn't so special.    There was a gentleman who looked like the owner who was approachable and friendly.  I think if the rest of the staff had his enthusiasm then this restaurant would be amazing.  The space is charming and cosy."}
{"text":"Over priced for the food. Oysters on special are $3, grilled octopus was good but swimming in olive oil, I wouldn't get it again.  Fish tacos were just ok, pear prosciutto with halloumi app is over priced, you get 3 pieces and it isn't amazing.  Given the small menu I hoped they would do their dishes extremely well.  I give 3 stars for the atmosphere, service, and homemade bread."}
{"text":"These guys know how to cook fish! Between us we had: ¤ bucket o' clams in garlic, butter and parsley - perfectly cooked - not a single 'bad' one (crack/broken or still closed), with a tender, flaky, buttery biscuit.  ¤ very good fries ¤ tasty clam chowder - creamy and rich, but not flour-thickened and stodgy ¤ the humus/veggie platter went over very well. ¤ very good fish tacos (the corn tortilla shells needed to be cooked a little more, they tasted a tad undercooked) but otherwise great combination of flavours on perfectly cooked fish. They even went the extra mile and pan seared one of the pieces of fish without any breading for my daughter who can't eat gluten. ¤ tender octopus with just the right hint of charring to bring out the flavour.  All-in-all I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Place is just awesome.  It's almost as if they have a metal-detector-type thing at the door that creates a force field that keeps anyone under 30 outside.    Which is amazing.     There's a warm social environment at the bar.  The place fills up nicely.  Feels busy but not obnoxiously packed.   Service is excellent.    Seafood dishes are as good as you'd expect from a place that has wooden boats in cases on the walls.  But it's all about the mushroom toast, no treble.   A really really good idea.    A very welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Eastside social is a fun, tasty, affordable little gem in Leslieville.  The interior is decked out in a classic nautical theme. A nice dinning room on the east part of the space and a lovely large, deep bar on the west side of the space. The staff is very welcoming and friendly and the owner serving as host was sincerely and genuinely present and chipper.  The dinning room has a nice communal high top which can fit up to 10 people if you have a fun rowdy group to bring.  We had the ceviche, fish tacos and smoked trout salad. I can recommend all of them especially the trout salad.  We didn't partake in any of the specialty drinks or desserts, so I can't comment on them.  Overall two thumbs up - and I think it's pretty safe to say you can stay here a bit later after dinner drinking dark and stormys singing I's The B'y.  !"}
{"text":"marty is the best server in toronto.   make sure you go on marty monday for the 80's tunes and half price wine (get the booze bucket anyways)   fish tacos are the best!!!   oysters are next level."}
{"text":"Booked a reservation online and when I came in they greeted me by name.  Don't be fooled by the double entrance, it's the one to the left.  Super clean and cute place to have dinner and drinks.  This is the kind of place that is a bit pricey, but well worth it.    The waiter was fantastic and the food was even better.  Get the molasses bread, just do it.  My mouth is salivating just thinking about it.  The PEI oysters and their daily pasta special was superb.  Just perfect."}
{"text":"Thought I put a review of this already... but turns out I didn't! Anyhow, apologize in advance for the bad quality pics :(.   The restaurant was spacious with a nice patio at the back. Service was attentive but then there was only 2 tables that night (on Sunday) so lol..   -Complimentary Dark Molasses Bread:  The bread was significantly denser and I'm usually not a fan of those, and I found the taste to be bitter yet sweet at the same time?  -Grilled Octopus - $20  the server warned me that this dish would be quite garlicky, and he was completely right! The octopus was tender and charred just right to bring out the flavors. With that said, the dish was too salty and heavy because of that puddle of olive oil. I love garlic and I thought this was a bit too much for me as well, and it was incredibly spicy because of the red chilies!   -Salmon Tartare - $17 The salmon was buttery light and fresh, I liked how the soy & lime vinaigrette wasn't too overpowering and complimented the fish perfectly. With that said, the dish was overly salted as well..."}
{"text":"First time at Eastside Social and will definitely go back. Ali our server was terrific. Food was really good - clam chowder is the best!! And we tried sardine on crostini as a starter and it was yummy. The main courses were delicious, the scallops in the scallops shrimp entree were huge! and delicious.  And a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"If I could give them a half, this would be a 3.5.   Food and ambiance was amazing. We walked in at 8:30pm on a Saturday and were lucky enough to get a table for 4 right by the window.   Ordered:  Clams with Fries Fried Calamari Flank Steak  Caesar Salad Fried Chicken   We were still hungry after our meal so we ordered the \"hamburger helper\".  The food itself was amazing. Beers were flowing. Cocktail was ok, ordered the Bourbon Sour.  The reason I don't want to go 4 stars, is that after spending $300 (tax & tip included) between the 2 couples, I was still a little peckish, and by no means have a very large appetite.   So overall. Great location, ambiance, nice food and drinks, acceptable service. Just smaller portions if you're ok with that."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, for an intimate dining experience or just great conversation with friends... and yes the food is great too. You almost can't go wrong with anything you pick, however we really enjoyed the octopus, the poke and the anchovy fried bread (total surprise!).  This is a nice jem in the area."}
{"text":"A new restaurant in the East end at Queen and Carlaw. We believe it was the owner who came by our table quite often who was one of the nicest people we met. He was telling us about the decor and where he buys all the plates and cups etc. Our server was also great and gave us some great recommendations. Our group shared everything and our server told us when we would need more or less. The food was delicious and well priced. Our top two choices was mushroom on toast and hamburger helper (make sure you share this or your stomach will not love you later ;)). Huffington Post got it right, one of the top places to try in 2015. Thanks East side Social!"}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place online ironically and decided to check it out. It was listed in a TO blog or some sort of article. I'm glad we checked it out as it was different from many other places we've dined at.  Entering East Side Social we were met by a bartender behind the bar with a smile, and the friendly hostess. Promptly we were seated. Luckily for us we got there around 6, being the 3rd table to seat. Shortly after we sat, the place was booming. A small group gathered, several couples arrived, and a father with his young daughter were noted to be on a \"date\" night. Almost all the tables were taken. The diningroom is bright enough for dinner, but soft and low enough for comfort. I'd like to be able to describe the decor but it won't do it justice. You'll have to see the pictures.  Getting to the food, it was delicious. It was different. My wife had the fish tacos which were not too far off from some others she's had elsewhere in the past, but the flavours were quite rich and filling. I had the grilled octopus, and although I found it quite flavorful, it was a slightly saltier, heavier dish filled with oil. I would get it again, but my wife and I agreed that getting only one of our two dishes to share and a salad would've been a better balanced lighter meal. Especially since we had the daily bread and beer as a starter. I don't think it helped that we also had french fries with the dinner - but it was still great overall. Just beware some dishes are heavy and salty.  The staff are really nice and professional. They're casual which fits into the coolness of the beaches (and my personality) but because they all wear black they easily pull off the professional style.  This place is on my list of restaurants I'll be visiting again. Check it out if you're in the area, you'll enjoy yourself no doubt."}
{"text":"This review is about the service. We went in and we're considering food, but after they took 20 minutes to come and take our drink order decided against it. When we wanted another round it again took way too long. On top of that they were just rude. Not returning."}
{"text":"Two words: Customer service.   You walk in and are always greeted at the door... usually with a handshake by the owner, Joey. As you leave, you get the same treatment. Seriously, you don't see this often enough.   Living around the corner for a half year, I had the privilege of many a dinner here and have probably tried the whole menu. The fried chicken is my go-to, as Chef Chris knocks it out of the park with both the chicken and the sides every time. Your mouth will thank me later!  The beers on tap aren't exhaustive but cover all bases, as does the wine list. With some new rotating signature cocktails, the classic cocktail list is starting to take a turn for the creative. The whiskey sours are one of the best I've had (behind my own of course)!   If you want a great, friendly vibe that really feels like you've taken a step to the east coast, stop in to Eastside any night. You will leave full, and inebriated (both on great energy AND great booze)!"}
{"text":"Popped in here around 8:30 on a Thursday night for a night cap after dinning elsewhere. I was asked if we were having dinner and I explained that we were just going to have a drink. I was rather curtly informed that this is more of an eating place. I was kind of confused as I saw a lot of people just with cocktails. And I mean business is business and it wasn't THAT busy! My look must have said it all coupled with the fact that I was okay with sitting at the bar; the tune quickly changed. I was a little miffed at the reception, but he must have just been having a bad moment because from there on out he was lots of fun.  We had a couple glasses of prosecco and I tried a classic vodka martini a little on the dirty side. I didn't find it dirty, but it was a clean delicious cocktail with no hints of wateriness which ruins such a classic beauty.  I am looking forward to returning to sample some of the food. I have heard the calamari is divine and I plan to put that to the test. A more extensive review will soon follow."}
{"text":"Have had brunch, drinks and a snack like dinner here. The brunch is beautiful. Presentation is king and quality ingredients. Yogurt parfait was spread out like a paint palate on a wood board with beautiful fruit and granola! Sadly this wasn't what I ordered, my poppyseed kale salad was just ok. Eggs, sausages and stuff were served in cast iron skillets and the like. Very rustic and cool. Had an awesome server when I went for brunch. Red head, hip and funny. Made me like the place more than before. First time I went I had a mix of feelings. The bartender was rude frankly so I cancelled my food order and sipped my drink. But the apparent owner I believe sitting at the bar, let me sample his Awesome hamburger helper inspired Mac & cheese, beefaroni veal thingy OMG amazing So overall need to go back, and I'm ordering that dish. And since I've sat at the bar once, the back patio once, it's about high time I sat in the dining room. Third times a charm and it just keeps getting better."}
{"text":"I've been living in Leslieville for 8 year. I love so many of our restaurants. I love supporting our community.   Eastside Social is my favorite. The food is spectacular. Every time I bite into a dish, I feel like I am tasting art.  The atmosphere is energized. There is an awesome balance of music, lighting and decor.  The crew is friendly, informative and present. They make you feel like you belong.   If you are coming to Leslieville, go here. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very nice. The server was excellent at the beginning of our dinner but then he got little rushed ( or busy)  and lost few points for not paying attention to us ( but otherwise he is one of the best waiters we have had in a long time ). The food was great. We shared Salmon Tartare and  Squid. The squid was very tender and the salmon tartar was fresh and very tasty. We really enjoyed the evening and food."}
{"text":"I haven't been compelled lately to write a review even though I am out 3 or 4 days a week but my experience at Eastside Social is worth writing about.  The place has a great vibe, the staff is friendly, and above all the food was great!  The oysters were top notch,  the mussels were very tasty and the grilled octopus is to die for.  I am looking forward to the chance to go again. If you are seafood fan I suggest you check it out."}
{"text":"We had a great evening!! Loved our waiter with all his dripping kindness and polite hostility. Always loved a good side eye roll. He was truly the STAR of the evening. The food did run a close race though. We started with the Calamari, which was very good (a tad salty but not enough to create any disappointment)  and then the Grilled Octopus.. which is divine!! Highly recommend both. Then Cleaned our palette with some fresh oysters and prepared for the Entrees. Entrees were a combination of Fish Tacos (Very Good) Kanpachi (Excellent) and Steak Frites (Very Good) and sharing the Crispy Kung Pao Salad (sooo Good!!) The table next to us were enjoying Steamed Mussels and the Mussels Carbonara Pasta and it looked and smelled amazing. Judging by the way they cleaned their plates... I am very confident to share that it must have pretty Damn Good!  I was a tad concerned going to this restaurant after looking at some of the reviews on Yelp... and must say I am glad that I didn't listen. Whoever is concerned about the portions sizes... Seriously! Get over it!! The portions are perfect!! Not the typical American roll yourself away from the table and waddled out the door. Instead we enjoy the perfect amount of food that tickled our tastebud and left us comfortable and wanting more but glad that we had just the right amount to leave gracefully and will a spring in our step that comes from just the right amount of alcohol, balanced with the perfect flavors that we will remember fondly as we continued our conversation from dinner reminiscing and laughing about the evenings events. The whole restaurant has a great vibe and I would not hesitate to come alone and hang at the bar and treat myself to a night out and enjoy again the food and the amusing staff and perhaps indulge in a conversation with a stranger. Loved it and will sending all my friends who will be in Toronto for Canada Day to enjoy a meal and some classic waiter entertainment. :) Truly a Hidden Gem in Plain sight on Queen Street. What are you still reading this for... Just go... see for yourself."}
