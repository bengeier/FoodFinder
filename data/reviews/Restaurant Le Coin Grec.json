{"text":"I came to this restaurant with a large group of people- maybe 12 of us. 

The waitstaff was attentive and helpful and the place was pretty big. It's in a great location as well. 

You can bring your own wine here too which was neat and saved the group a lot of money. I am unsure if there was a corking fee.

The food was solid- I wasn't blown away by it but it was good, no-frills Greek comfort food and the prices were fair.

Everyone had a wonderful time. I'd come again."}
{"text":"\"Le coin grec\" is my favorite casual greek restaurant in town. I have been coming here for 25 years and always enjoy good food and a confortable setting."}
{"text":"I went here once. It was a very strange experience. The entire restaurant was manned by one person. She took my order, made my meal and worked the cash register on the way out. I was the only person in the restaurant at the time. 

I ordered pork souvlaki with Greek salad and I must admit it was quite good. But it was still a strange feeling. 

I would try it again, but maybe more for takeout. Certainly not on a date;)"}
{"text":"MA PLACE pour manger de la bonne bouffe grecque! Souvent, je commande différentes entrées avec du pain et je partage. 

À essayer: les souvlakis pitas ou en assiette (pour les gros appétits), le fromage feta, le café grec et les baklavas!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place has stayed in business for so long or even managed to get good reviews. It's quite possibly the worst Greek food in Montreal. 

We ordered the pikilia platter as an appetizer. The dips were average but they were most probably the store bought dips from Arahova. I expected the spanakopita to be fresh and crispy. Instead, it was cold, soggy and with a filling that did not resemble or tasted like spinach. The main course was not better. The gyro meat and the souvlaki were both dry and tasted like rubber.

We were not the only unsatisfied customers. The person next to our table sent back his meal twice and did not eat his plate.

In conclusion, please avoid!"}
