{"text":"Had a wonderful experience last night !! I needed to escape the heat and was happy to walk into the cool refreshing atmosphere. I see another yelper has said no air conditioning. This is NOT the case. They definitely have it ! Yesterday was one of the hottest days and the place was a lovely cool temperature.

The food was delicious, the swordfish pasta was amazing. Very fresh !!

The cocktails were also great. 

I would definitely go back !!"}
{"text":"As an area resident, I'm so happy to have Ardo in the 'hood.  As someone who spent a lot of their life around amazing home cooked Italian food, I often find that Italian restos in town fall short of my high expectations: pastas too mushy, food underseasoned, menu options boring or too extensive. I would say that Ardo has raised the game and competes with the small number of Toronto's top Italian joints.  I have been there probably 7 or 8 times now, and it's been consistently good every time. In my opinion, their mushroom gnocchi are the best potato gnocchi in town. The main proteins are limited to a daily meat and a daily fish, but which have always been spot on: I generally have gone for the fish (as I eat a lot of it), and it has been super fresh and excellently cooked every time.  The pizzas are tasty, although not as exciting as their pastas in my opinion.  Every app or small plate I've had has been very good: the octopus always cooked perfectly (even places like Lee, Bar Raval, and Carbon Bar, where I generally love the octopus, have messed it up on more than one occasion that I have been there (undercooked and rubbery, or under-seasoned and bland); not so at Ardo.  Roberto and his staff are always super friendly and it's great to have them and their restaurant in the neighbourhood. The only crappy thing is that it's so popular that walk in visits are hit and miss more recently, since word has travelled far and folks from far away places like Yorkville, Woodbridge and other areas, who would otherwise never be caught dead at King and Sherbourne (except maybe to buy a sofa at Italinteriors) are taking up the seats, and apparently liking the food and experience just as much as me."}
{"text":"Months later and I still love Ardo. So happy it's in my 'hood. Lovely ambience, friendly service, and the most delicious food. I've visited here about 15 times and it's always a delicious delight. Congratulations Chef Roberto and all your staff!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled across Ardo in an attempt to explore different pasta joints downtown. We were immediately seated and had the pleasure to sit in front of the kitchen/prep area. Neither of us have had a dining experience like this before and we were excited to be immersed in the preparation of delicious food.

We started with the bread and had a side of olive oil and a spicy chilli paste. I ordered the funghi gnocchi and my boyfriend had the salsiccia pasta. This was the best gnocchi dish I've ever had and I was blown away by the simplicity of it. The salsiccia pasta had a great kick so we were stealing bites from each other's plate. 

However, the highlight of the night was being able to watch how the food went from kitchen to plate. You can see how focused the chefs were and the attention and care they put into their food. I would highly recommend sitting in this area if there are spots available. Kudos to them for being able to cook and check in with guests at the same time!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious birthday dinner for my husband with our family. We ordered the polpo, grilled to perfection and so tender - to die for actually. The buratta was beautifully accompanied by some wine marinated peaches - wonderful surprise. My husband and I ordered pizza and they came flat bread style which meant no soggy middle - the crust was outstanding!  I'm in love with the pizza. My teen/adolescent children ordered the ragu pasta and the flavour of the meat was superb.  Definitely enjoyed our meal and will be coming back for more!!! Chef Roberto and his staff were very attentive to us and all the other patrons and that was really nice."}
{"text":"Wonderful decor. A Mediterranean seaside theme fitting to the southern Italian flavor. Eggplant appetizer was delicious, and their arugula and artichoke salad was good. However, the mains were ho hum. She tried the sarde pasta, a miss. I had the spicy cured meat pizza, and it was over salted on the crust with runny and bland tomato sauce. Maybe it was just our night... pricey for the outcome. Another knock is the anxiety of the place. All staff are running around and the hectic nature doesn't bode well for a romantic evening."}
{"text":"Decor:  Nicely done.  Good feel.  

Polpi:  Perfectly grilled, tender, with just a little char.  Caponata complimented it nicely.

Sarde:  Just like the online menu picture (pity I did not look at it before going), it is one fillet of sardine atop of a tennis ball sized mound of pasty tasting pasta.  Sauce has no flavour...just lukewarm and salty.  Tried to eke out the sardine fillet to finish the paste/pasta.  Disappointing.

Cannoli:  Best part of the meal.  Crispy outside that breaks into delicious shards in your mouth, creamy, just sweet enough ricotta filling, studded with fragrant candied orange peel and bits of chocolate.

Worst part of the evening:  Our server.  She kept hip checking my chair (once, hard enough to move me and the chair) in her eagerness to get to the table beside us (three gentlemen who made it clear they had expense accounts).  Never apologized, even once.  The tables were very close, so when she lingered (often) at their table, her ass was pretty much overhanging our table and in our face.  She giggled and flirted with the expense account holders, showed them pictures on her personal cell phone and drank from one of their wine glasses,complimenting them on their good wine selection.  Basically, our food was slammed on our table on the way to theirs.  It was only at the end of the meal did she slow down, smile and ask how our food was.  Tip time, I guess.  Even though we live in the neighbourhood, we will not be back.

Well...maybe just to get the cannoli to go...."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Tuesday night. Arrived at 630. We were seated quickly. The place filled up shortly after we sat down. Had the blood orange cocktail...delish. 

Shared 2 apps. Had the pizza with cantaloupe and speck. So good. Needed a little pepper for my taste. Also had the Arancinos. Yum. I love that they came as cones and not as round balls. 

For my main I had the special - stuffed grilled calamari. So yummy. I like the side it came with. Shaved Celery-like salad with some heat. My husband had the short ribs. He devoured it. 

Service was good. It appears that some of the staff are still getting comfortable - but that's to be expected with a place that just opened 3 weeks ago.

Would definitely return to Ardo. There were so many other things on the menu I wanted to try!"}
{"text":"We showed up at 5:45 and the place was empty. Hostess told no seats available. We opted to sit at the uncomfortable bar seats. As more people came in without reservations they were given the option to sit at tables provided they left by 8 in time for peoples reservations. It was very rude and we were treated poorly. The food was small portioned too. They need to figure out their reservation system and allow all entrants the same access to seats."}
{"text":"The sarde is fair. Two fillets on top of a softball sized mount of (slightly rubbery) pasta. 

Don't go if it is a hot/humid day or evening NO AIR CONDITIONING! And what's worse, I had to beg for water refills. Small busy space, but this one isn't that hard. 

The octopus was really tasty though. 

Negroni was served with a huge orange wedge that overpowered the drink. 

The couscous with shellfish was much better than the Sarde, but the shrimp were a bit overcooked. Clams were delicious. 

Overall, mixed bag."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious southern Italian food. We sat at the chefs table and got to witness some real passion in the kitchen. Ended up ordering way too much food because everything looked so good! Had the crostini, carpaccio, arrancini, pizza, sarde pasta and the beef shoulder. Everything was incredible!! Fresh, flavourful and made with love. Even the bread is made in house and it is to die for. I highly recommend this place. I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food. All in all our new go to place downtown. My wife discovered Ardos last week and she had to show it to me last night.
Chef Roberto is a joy !!

{"text":"We continue to love this restaurant -- the people, the food, the neighbourhood.  Still a 5 star for us, and we note it's earned high marks this year in the press."}
{"text":"After shelling out $30 for two cocktails the waiter would not allow me to add homemade Italian Sausage on a margherita pizza ($16). I can appreciate restaurants not allowing complex edits to their menu with substitutions and such as they have crafted recipes for specific purposes, but the fact that this restaurant wouldn't acquiesce to a very simple request left me quite perturbed. Rest assured, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Small, intimate, Sicilian restaurant.  Have eaten here a few times for lunch and dinner.  The food is very good overall- the arancini are wonderful, and I'm often tempted to order a dozen of them instead of a main!  Recently had a pizza here which was rather disappointing, but everything else I've had has been really good.  Service has always been prompt, knowledgeable, and friendly.  
If possible, avoid the two tables closest to the door."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time for a business lunch. The food was amazing. I had the funghi- gnocchi with mushrooms and it really took me back to vacations in Italy. The service was not overly friendly but efficient. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you like Italian food and find yourself in the King East area."}
{"text":"Was in last night with a colleague from NY, we know restaurants. I dont write many reviews but I had to write one today.  This place was just amazing Chef Roberto has nailed it. The lamb was over top and pasta w/sausage was bang on. Simple with fresh ingredients - cant wait to get back. Ciao"}
{"text":"I'd like start my review by pointing out that Ardo, charges you for all the people that don't show up for you reservation which can sometimes happen with larger groups.  My feeling is if you're going to do that, you better set the bar high for service. At Ardo, this is not the case. Our reservation for this awful night was made 3 weeks in advance. 

When we arrived, the table we reserved had people who were just served their mains. They suggested we find some other place in the neighbourhood to have drinks until they were ready. That's a waste of our time and for a restaurant  that charges people for cancellation, pretty low.

They finally seated us at the chefs table which only had 5 stools for 6 people and was designed bar style making it difficult for us to have a conversation as a group.  Their only solution for the negative experience was a glass of proseco.

The server was rude and the staff seemed to be pretty indifferent about it all. 

Avoid this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have become regulars here. I absolutely adore the atmosphere and how I always feel like I'm walking into someone's home. The owner Roberto and the young guys working the kitchen bar are amazing. So genuine and the food is just ridiculously amazing. I can't say enough great things about it. A hidden little gem. 

Homemade lemonchello to finish your meal ;)"}
{"text":"I moved into a condo and stumbled upon this restaurant. The food is incredible and the staff are incredibly friendly and eager to help. I've been back three times this week--it's that good! 

Definitely try the Norma pasta and the octopus, clam, and shrimp appetizer."}
{"text":"Ardo brings Southern Italian eats to Corktown.  We were seated by the window which opens up onto King Street -  there are only a few tables at the front, so try to grab one!  Chef Roberto Marotta offers Sicilian dishes and refreshing Campari cocktails.

The Polpo ($13) was my favourite dish.  The octopus was perfectly grilled and tender, chewy and fresh.

I found the burrata ($19) slightly underwhelming.  The cheese was firmer and the wine-preserved peaches were not as sweet as expected.  :(

Carpaccio ($16) was good served with arugula, cheese, pistachios, and mushrooms.

As far as salads go, the cavolo ($14) was fun, cheerful and colorful.
Kale, romaine, radish, with crispy parsnip and shaved parm.

The ragú ($17) was fairly standard, meat sauce on pasta.  We packed the rest to take home.

The margherita was topped with fresh basil, a midweight crust, but it wasn't particularly memorable. ($14).

The desserts are simple.  The cannoli is popular and plated nicely.  The ricotta center was a bit runnier than desired.  The pistachio gelato was delicious though.

Overall, we had a nice meal here.
In terms of service, it was a bit slow, but the restaurant is still new.

We might have ordered a lot of carbs, but it might have been nice to have been offered bread.
By the time we finished out meal, the table next to us had cycled through two seatings.
We looked longingly at bread served next to us.. twice. 
Sometimes, all a girl wants is bread.  Lots and lots of bread."}
{"text":"Thank you to the incredible staff @ardorestaurant. We had an incredible experience, especially sitting at the chef's table and watching the Masters work to create our incredible meals. Ardo is a MUST visit. We had the Etna pizza , polpo, acchiuge, panelle (Sicilian chick pea fritters...just like nonna makes), pasta con sarde (a Sicilian delicacy and my all time favorite pasta dish) and the bread, sausage and pasta is made in-house fresh from scratch!!!!! Chef/owner Roberto Malotta was so kind and hospitable, and even came over to tell us about the restaurant and check in on us. We felt like family. Well done! We cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to visit this restaurant twice in two weeks.  The food is very good. Portions perfect & flavours multi layered.
However the menu needs to be more clear - ordered gnocchi and it came with a cream sauce with no mention of that on the menu.

Our service was markedly different in the two visits. I believe this is because the lack of experience. Removing plates before everyone was finished, etc. But the server was very attentive - that happy medium between not enough and too much. And also there was barely five minutes between the first course finishing and second course being placed. Which is a kitchen issue.

I really like this restaurant and the food, and would recommend it. Just interesting the two different experiences."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I got a last minute reservation tonight at Ardo.  We chose this restaurant based on our love for Italian food and the excellent reviews we read online.  We were very excited for some great eats and wine.  We asked for a 6pm reservation and were told to come anytime between 5:30 and 6, we just had to be out by 8 as there was a reservation - no problem, we thought, we had somewhere to be too!  We arrived and immediately loved the atmosphere, the restaurant is cozy and clean with an open kitchen.  That's where the positive part of this review stops.

It's a Monday night and it was before 6pm, we were the only people there when we arrived - you would think there would be amazing service.  But where do I begin...

First of all, we asked for bread while you were waiting, and you have to pay for it.  I love fine dining and am happy to shell out on a high quality meal and fantastic wine, but having to pay for bread?!  That's terrible customer service.  Two of us got pasta - I got the ragu and my friend got the lobster ravioli on special - they were both ok, but nothing great.  Our friends got arancini and pizza and seemed to like them a lot more, so if I ever do go back, pizza it will be.  My ragu wasn't overly flavourful (truthfully I like Cibo's ragu much better), and desperately needed pepper, but after our food was delivered, we didn't see a server again until our plates were cleared.  The portions of the pasta were quite small, and my friend who got the pasta and I were both still so hungry when we were finished that we wanted to order a pizza to split, but no server came by to see if we wanted anything else.  Also, the wine list is terrible.  They only have 2 red wines by the glass, and I can safely say the one I tried wasn't great.  I would have loved to have tried the other one, or really have a second glass of anything considering I had finished my small 5 oz glass by halfway through my meal, but... you guessed it.. we didn't see a server until the plates were cleared.

After our plates were clear, we waited over 20 minutes before a server came by again.  To be clear, this restaurant is quite small (15 tables top), and we were seated right by the kitchen, so they couldn't exactly miss us.  Finally we ordered dessert from a different server, and then waited 20 more minutes without any kind of attention.  We flagged her down, asked about status of dessert, and she responded with a very rude \"it's coming\".  It ended up being over 45 minutes from the time our dinner plates were cleared until we got dessert.  It also took her forever to bring our bills and cash us out, so not only did we hold the table unnecessarily long, but we were very late leaving for our other commitments too.  I'm usually quite generous with tipping, and I would never hold back part of a server's gratuity based on the taste of food, but this is quite honestly the worst service I have ever seen.  There was no reason for a table to go unattended so long, and I would have loved to have tried more things to improve my opinion, but not only were we not attended to, but one of the servers was quite rude.  Aren't you supposed to be selling patrons on more drinks?  My bill ended up being quite low for a normally pricey restaurant because I only had one drink and needless to say there wasn't much of a tip, but I would've loved to have spent 3 times this amount for a better quality meal with service.

The atmosphere of this place is great, but I can recommend about a dozen other Italian restaurants in Toronto that have way better wine selection and better service.  Two stars was generous for my experience tonight."}
{"text":"Some of these negative reviews are very misleading.  Look I'm visiting from LA...I know I have a good palate and eat at some of the best places.  Ardo is a quaint small neighborhood spot...food is good ..not amazing but solid. Service was excellent, my waitress was great and the chef (guessing maybe owner) walked around and asked how everything was. Def worth a visit."}
{"text":"This HAS to be Toronto's best kept secret!!  Not only was I amazed with my food, but so was everyone else at our table!  Not a huge space so book ahead.  The staff are unbelievable.  Beyond nice.  So easy to tell they take pride in their work.  High quality food at a perfect price.  Very clean restaurant.  Going back for sure."}
{"text":"We went to Ardo last night to celebrate my sister's birthday - she and her husband were visiting from Boston. The food was great, but what elevated it to a 5 stars was by far the service. We started the evening by discussing which bottle of wine to order - my brother in law asked the waiter which would be best based on our particular tastes, who promptly spoke to the sommelier and recommended an Montepulciano (which we were already leaning towards). Also of note, this was second least expensive red, so they aren't trying to oversell you.

Then the food! The waiter told us the specials, particularly an heirloom tomato salad, where the tomatoes had just arrived fresh today. We also asked about the vegetarian options (as 3 out of the 6 of us are veggie) for recommendations, and the waiter brought out the chef to make suggestions! Very nice touch. We went on to order the melanzana, the polpo, the artichoke pizza, peche & zola pizza, Sicilian seafood cous cous, anatra and the ragu. 

All of the food was excellent (as was the bread which they make in house along with the olive oil they import from Sicily), but in my biased opinion I think my pizza was the best - wine soaked peaches with fior di latte, gorgonzola, toasted almonds and arugula. An uncommon combination which worked perfectly. 

We also mentioned to the waiter that it was my sister's birthday when she was away from the table, so they brought out an extra dessert on the house with a candle. This was in addition to the two orders of cannoli we had ordered. All in all an excellent meal, and very fairly priced (pre-tip was about $210 for six people including the wine). I wasn't able to catch our waiter's name, but he was just fabulous. Really seemed to enjoy doing his job well, and seemed very pleased that we enjoyed our food so thoroughly (all empty plates over here!). Would definitely go back, and highly recommend."}
{"text":"cute spot, good food, no compaints!"}
{"text":"We eat out 3-5 dinners a week, and most lunches, so we are lucky enough to get around. We came here tonight for a friend's 60th birthday dinner, and during the day I had dropped off a few balloons, nothing major, to place at our table, which was not in anyone else's way. The staff took them and told me they would be placed at the table. When we arrived, I was told they had been put in the basement because the owner did not think that fit the image of his restaurant. Not a great start, and after dinner I called some of the places we really love...much better than this restaurant....and asked about balloons, and no one had the remotest of issues. So there was that. This place was really inconsistent in its delivery and service. We didn't feel they have really worked out who they want to be. Our server was nice, but, and not his fault, had clearly not been properly trained. From not taking drink orders for 10 minutes in a not-full restaurant, to making us feel we were being rushed through the process, to removing dishes from the table before we had all finished eating a course, to sending over line staff who had not been told who ordered which dish....it was not the service I would expect from a restaurant at this price point. After the first glass, I had to do all the wine pouring for the table. And if one more server asks me, \"How are the first few bites?\" I will throw up. SO overused. Besides, we did not get the impression he really cared, but was just asking, as our less-than-enthusiastic answers received a, \"Great!\" as he rushed off. The food....some was AMAZING. The pastas we had, the burrata...just lovely. The two pizzas, however, and the bruschetta, were barely passable. I normally hoover everything put in front of me, and I left half the pizza. Not like me at all. Affogatos were mixed at the end of our table and left there for us to serve out. Our bill was brought to the table without an ask to to what else we might want, less than halfway through our desserts. Our doggie bags were delivered to us before we ordered dessert. The whole experience felt all over the place. We could not have a few small balloons at our table, yet we were served by someone who was clearly not trained in the basics. Too many inconsistencies in a market full of choices."}
{"text":"Had a variety of dishes (egglant, arancini, sarde pasta, cannoli's) and all were fanatstic. Particularly, they serve authentic olive oil with bread, a pkeasant surprise for anyone who knows what real quality olive oil tastes like (90% of restaurants serve below grade olive oil)."}
{"text":"I thought the food was ok, but nothing special. Had the beef carpaccio and salcicce pasta. My main disappointment was that we were asked if we wanted bread when the waiter came to pour us water after we sat down. Said yes and then only realized as I was eating the bread that there was a charge (details are on the very last page of the menu). I don't think there's an issue with charging for bread, just wish they weren't so shady about hiding the fee for it."}
{"text":"So refreshing to see passion and palate collide. Chef/Owner Roberto keeps to the authentic Sicilian flavour and sources his ingredients from across Canada and around the world. Highly recommend sitting at the Chef's Table where you can witness first hand Roberto and his team creating magic for the table. So glad this is steps from my door as I will definitely be a regular!
Note: this is not the kind of place you ask for substitutions, if that's a problem.  That would be like asking Picasso to use crayons!  This is EDIBLE ART!"}
{"text":"My favourite new place in Corktown.  A breath of basil infused air.  Homemade pastas and inventive starters.  The olive oil is to die for especially when paired with their homemade bread.  That should be good on its own but the service and food just cannot be beat.  I have had the orecchiette with sausage and it is my all time favourite without tomato sauce.  (Ok I lied as pesto is right up there too!)  To end the night we shared the cannoli.  Holy cannoli is what it should be named.  Delicate and creamy reminding me of simple Italian faves I had the privilege of experiencing growing up with Italian besties and their family.  I will be back here and might even sleepwalk here!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant with great food and a nice atmosphere.   Everything was quick and staff are fantastic.  It's busy so plan ahead and make reservations."}
{"text":"Food was okay, I wasn't blown away. The space is nice, it's small and intimate but I thought they could dim the lights more to give more ambiance. Portions are on the smaller side, and price tags are on the steeper side. Overall, not super impressed with my experience compared to other Italian favourites in the city."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was melt-in-your mouth delicious.  I have several dietary restrictions and they were kind enough to suggest modifications and make me the gnocchi with another sauce and a few small modifications (a lot of higher-end restaurants can be strict about making substitutions).  I appreciated that they were patient and went back to the kitchen to see how I could be accommodated.  I can't wait to come back!

A few small things - they charged us for bread, the portions could have been a bit more generous, the restaurant is a bit noisy (likely because it is long and narrow), and took a while between courses (but we were a party of five).

Otherwise, felt that the restaurant certainly lived up to the hype!"}
{"text":"Lovely place and delicious food. Real Italian food with wonderful and friendly Italian owners. I felt I was in Europe :-). I had my European fix ;-)."}
{"text":"Checked this spot out a few weeks ago for small birthday dinner. Had apps, pizza and pasta. Nothing to write home about. Service was average/good, but we likely won't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"very nice classy spot.  i like the intimate setting.
the bartender is exceptionally nice as well the subtle ambience is not overachieving.  i love the atmosphere, lowkey, and a nice place to chat with a close friend or date without having to svream in order to hear eachother.  its quaint but still a good size.  overall great experience would.come back for the wine selection and service."}
{"text":"Hello Toronto!

I had the opportunity tonight to try out Ardo for the first time.  It's menu described delicious Sicilian cuisine which me and my friends were excited to try.  We ordered the specials tonight, pesce black cod dish, lobster ravioli, and veal. First I should say they called us to come to the resto for 8:45 (our reso was st 8:30), that was all good but we sat at 9:00, we never received our appetizer of sardines on bread (this looked so darn good!), we waited over an hour to order food as no one checked on us. Our food arrived luke warm, we never received our bread or sausage pasta order. We told them and they still charged us, we had to inform a different waiter as we kept getting different servers. It was all very confusing and I'm still hungry! I unfortunately did not enjoy my experience here. Please take this review as an opportunity to build upon your strengths and work on your weaknesses Ardo.  As Sicilian food should be served warm, delicious, and your guests should always feel welcome, which we did not. :("}
{"text":"Still have the training wheels on, but a lot of potential to be a fantastic neighbourhood spot. Decent food, nice decor, staff seems friendly, and that's what will help this place succeed - as long as the focus remains on establishing a consistent following because of a nice neighbourhood feel, it's guaranteed to always have loyal patrons."}
{"text":"We had dinner here recently on the advice of a friend. It was terrific beginning to end. Amazin Sicilian cuisine. We started with the grilled octopus and kale caesar. For entrees, the orecchiette and the wild fish feature and rapini. The food was beautifully prepared and delicious.  The bartender made us his own signature Cosmopolitans. Among the best we've ever had. We generally avoid desserts but decided to give the canolli a try - unbelievable. The cheese was so light and sweet. Our server was lovely - energetic, friendly but professional. It's not large restaurant so it has a more cozy feeling. We will definitely return. A must try if you haven't been."}
{"text":"Amazing place! The owner gave us a glass of Sicilian wine which we loved and bought a bottle after. I've been here before, surprisingly service and food still outstanding. Nothing pretentious, just well executed food and service. We got the table in front of chef bar and was amazed. Don't feel"}
{"text":"The word ARDO comes from the verve Arder. It translates from Spanish as  a burning passion. Though the restaurant does not derive from the conjugation of the verve, ARDO restaurant is its definition come to life; a burning passion  of food, tastes and flavours... One of the best restarts I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. Chef Roberto and his staff have passion, love, and a burning desire for their craft. From the minute you enter you are treated like family. If YELP had more than five stars, they would deserve them all. The passion of of the kitchen crew for their craft is evident in the food. It speaks volumes of the love for their creations. Our server was professional and made sure we enjoyed ourselves. Roberto, chef and owner, is a culinary maestro on a grand scale. He conducts his culinary symphony with ARDOR and his restaurant is his symphony orchestra. BRAVO ARDOR! 
Highly recommend! In fact it needs to be a stop for everyone!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night with a reservation mentioning a birthday(Was slightly disappointed there was no special for a birthday, because I went to another place the night before and they included dessert). At 6.30 it was still a bit empty but filled up as the night went on. It was highly rated on websites for having good pasta so we went to try it out. 

The place is nicely decorated, wasn't that big but felt cozy. The servers were nice and knowledgeable on the specials, she really memorized a whole speech with the options for the night. 

We got the beef carpaccio and grilled octopus to start. Both were good, the octopus was nicely grilled and not chewy at all. The beef was thin and the parmesan and arugula and pickles on top added great textures. 

For the mains I got the salsiccia pasta, with orecchiette pasta and spicy sausage. The pasta itself was good, great texture and had a good chew. Had a good pasta to topping ratio. The portion wasn't too big I definitely could have used a bigger plate to be more full. I also tried the sarde pasta, with sardines. However the sardines felt too fishy and added a slightly unpleasant taste to it. The portion again was not big. The pizzas were also mediocre, seriously forgettable, there are much better pizzas in the city. Overall the mains were very disappointing especially with all the hype and reviews. 

We ended with 3 desserts. The cannoli and the adffogato was good, solid, although not outstanding. The cassata was interesting in a good way, pistachio ice cream hiding under ricotta mouse with lots of toppings of candied fruit, melon chunks and chocolate, it seems like a lot but everything together was delicious! 

Overall it wasn't bad but it also wasn't great, I don't think I'll be returning since there are much better options for Italian food around the city."}
{"text":"The Anatra... \"house made fettuccine, muskova duck ragu with 5 secret Sicilian spices, crispy kale\" is worth every, single, bite. As much as I wanted to inhale each mouthful of this heavenly pasta, I willed myself to savour the experience. We both agreed that this entrée had so much depth and flavour and really sustained quite the impression. *sighs happily

TL;DR: ANATRA. ANATRA. ANATRA."}
{"text":"Great Cannoli

The rest of the dishes fell short to me. 

The service was friendly and professional/upscale and design of the restaurant is pleasant."}
{"text":"\"Is this place Ar-do or Ar-don't??\" This was my exclamation last night after tasting yet another disappointing course. To be fair, the service was very good and so I have to be clear that this rating is purely based on the quality (or lack thereof) of the food.

For our first course, we shared several dishes: the Etna pizza, anchovy crostini, octopus salad, and beef carpaccio. The pizza held such promise based on the description on the menu (tomato sauce, fior di latte, rapini, house made chili oil, house made Sicilian spicy sausage) but the execution left much to be desired. It came out tasting very bland and mostly of the dough on which the sparse ingredients were laid. It was a similar story with the lackluster other dishes.

For our second course, a bunch of us ordered the lobster ravioli...problem was, they ran out of ravioli so had to substitute with bowtie pasta, which turned out to be a disaster. At least they gave us an option to switch, that I seized on to pick the salsiccia, which ended up being half-decent but nothing to write home about.

The wine list was meh and no option to pay corkage and BYOW. As a result, I'm sorry to say that I will not be rushing back here."}
{"text":"Went there last evening with a group of 4 and had an excellent meal. The menu was clearly, service was great, and would come back if/when I'm in the area.

I'd recommend the grilled octopus out of the appetizers we had though the carpaccio comes in a close second. I had the sarde as my main after reading reviews and it tasty as described, but probably not for everyone (you really do need to like sardines to like this)."}
{"text":"A truly artisanal meal experience! 
Have a seat at the chefs table to watch the creation of some really fantastic meals! 
Chef Roberto brings his years of experience in Siciliano cuisine to your senses.   Try the Sarde pasta - it's sardines at the next level !"}
{"text":"We showed up promptly for a reservation made on Open Table.  We were seated in this squashed table practically sitting on the laps of a couple of four-tops nearby.  Excruciatingly obnoxious and loud patrons forced us to leave without ordering.  The restaurant then had the nerve to report to Open Table that we were no-shows.  Really poor form - do not go to this restaurant unless you are pushy, loud and vulgar - then you should fit right in."}
{"text":"The food is lovely but a little over priced. Make sure you have a reservation. Great for lunch and the service is good !"}
{"text":"It was pretty good, but nothing so special that I'd make the trip here over visiting other Italian restaurants. Our cocktails were suberb (I think they were the house cocktail.. something fizzy and fruity). The charcuterie platter was really good -- no pates, all cured meats and cheeses. I would order it again if I came back.
Service was good, but no more or less than you'd expect at a nice place like this.
My main was fine, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Lousy service as they were overly familiar trying to be my chum instead of being a server. My entree arrived while I was in bathroom therefore it was less than hot. Food was mediocre and I left very quickly"}
{"text":"This review is written after my second visit to Ardo

The first time when I visited with my significant other, it was marred by various issues - this small resto was too packed, and my water drinking glass smelled funky (like the moldy smell from a dirty rag) which my server had to change several times because the new ones smelled too. Other patrons had the same issue, so it wasn't just me. But anyway, after that was resolved, I thought the food was alright.

My second visit was with a group of friends, and the night started promising. We ordered the crochette, octopus and the cavolo salad as starters. I didn't try the crochette nor the salad (both looked just ok, nothing special), but the octopus was delicious - it was tender and flavourful.

For my main course, I went with the sardine pasta. Long story short, it was \"meh\". I did not love how the toasted bread crumbs tasted and hated the texture it gave to the dish; the pasta was al dente but the flavor was weird due to the sauce almost being \"too sweet\", which did not go with the flavor profile of the sardines.

My companions ordered the truffled gnocchi, the etna pizza (fior di latte, sicilian sausage and rapini) which I had the first visit and liked, and the seafood cous cous. The person who ordered the pizza did not like the bitterness of the rapini (which I would have liked); the gnocchi was mushy and did not have any truffle taste to it, and the friend who ordered the cous cous obviously hated it since she barely touched the dish at all.

For dessert, we ordered the cannoli, the affogato and the torta all'arancia. The only thing that looked good to me was the affogato, which is almost impossible to screw up. The cannoli looked a bit dry to me, and the torta looked like an ordinary cake.

Overall, me and my companions had high hopes for this visit, and we left disappointed. The food is not \"horrible\" per se, but for a place that seems to have all the hype going for it and lots of patron-packed nights, I think the popularity might be unjustified.

YMMV"}
{"text":"I have no idea how this made Toronto Life's list of best new restaurants in 2017. I went on a Saturday night with 4 people - all of us unanimously agreed that this place was awful!

We ordered the polpo, carpaccio and burrata to start (they should really take a trip to campagnolo to see how it's done); the mushroom gnocchi and their special lobster ravioli for mains, both of which were absolutely horrible. The lobster came to the table frozen, so the waitress apologized and took it back, but left the ravioli (so al dente you'd call it undercooked). We were then left to eat the lobster on its own.

I'd get into the pizza we ordered, but you get the gist of it. To be clear, I definitely do not recommend this place! Save yourself the disappointing trip and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Great day to come to this restaurant when it's cold and snowy outside. Weekends are usually packed, which means you have to make early reservations. 
The service is impeccable plus the ambience. Personal, and the open kitchen that you can see people coming always excites me.

The chefs pizza special was ordered, which was abit salty on the crust. But the pasta with sardines and raisins was amazing! The pasta has a really nice bite to it Al dente and fresh. 
It came as a surprise to me that they charged for bread. Not that it's a big deal, but the bread was mediocre. The saving Grace was the olive oil that came alongside for dipping. A must try, imported and directly flown in Sicilian olive oil. It's Grade A olive oil (besides from Kalamata). 
 
Chef Roberto has done well in making this one of the must try and go- to Italian restaurant along on King Street. But only if you like the Sicilian Italian food style."}
{"text":"I was recommended this restaurant recently and was not disappointed at the experience. Exceptional and caring service with fairly knowledgeable recommendations for someone picky in our group. We ordered four things total for three people, under the recommendation of our server; the peche n' zola pizza, salsicca pasta, potato and cod croquettes, and the daily ravioli special. 

We started off with the croquettes, which were very light and fluffy with clear notes of the cod. The peach and gorgonzola pizza was very sweet and savoury, with pronounced, but not overpowering gorgonzola taste, nice and sweet peach taste, and a nice and crisp crust. The salsicca was very well seasoned and tossed, the pasta's firm texture helped to bring together all the flavours. The light hint of spice from the sausage helped to give the dish a little bit of a kick. The ravioli special was six pieces of butter-nut squash ravioli in a lobster bisque/stock (I don't fully remember) with some mussels and baby shrimp. A discrete, yet prominent lobster flavour as well as a creamy squash taste helped to blend the flavours together. The leftover bisque/stock also went well with the bread we had available :)

An overall pleasant experience."}
{"text":"They have no idea about italian kitchen! Just think , burrata without tomato ?????? I never seen in my life! What kind of mentality ? When I say I need tomato , they gave me little bit small tomato and they charged 4.00 dolar ? I said my italian friend , he couldnt believe! Shit , more than shit restaurant! Dont go"}
{"text":"I go to many restaurants throughout the gta (including Italian - being Italian myself) and this place was not at all as the many fabricated reviews say it is. They try to portray themselves as a high end restaurant unfortunately the quality of the food and how it is cooked is very poor. A Big Mac truly would have satisfied me much more than spending how much we did for such bad quality. 

My friend and I ordered a pizza to share and a plate of pasta each followed by dessert. 

The gnocchi was extremely soggy/over cooked. I mentioned it to the owner who was a real jerk about it saying he could recommend other places that serves gnocchi! Disgusting for an owner to say that. The pizza (literally) had absolutely no flavor to it. Not even the basics as salt. 

Lastly and most importantly. We had ordered the cannoli for dessert and the filling had gone bad/rotten. It tasted like rotten egg. I had to give it back and asked him to try it and he said it must be my taste buds! The waitress said she was going to go to the back to try it and that the owner wouldn't let her. It got thrown out and he was hiding in the back until we had left. 

Our waitress was friendly, the ambiance was nice, but the quality of food and the personality and mannerisms of the owner was awful. He was always at the front bar drinking glasses of wine when maybe he could have been ensuring their food wasn't past expiration and prepared well. 

I'd definitely NOT go back to this place. Terroni, Buca, Cibo, Dimmi's, Nudo and Campagnolo (to name a few) are all way better choices than Ardo. 

The owner mentioned he had other 'unfortunate experiences' in his other restaurant ventures and I can absolutely see why. I don't see this place lasting more than a year."}
{"text":"This experience, at one of the supposed \"best new restaurants in Toronto\" , was entirely lackluster. The server was disengaged, borderline rude, and inattentive. The food was either over seasoned, under seasoned, or just not note worthy. And the environment was confusing with a purportedly authentic southern Italian feel, but horrendous disco playing - music only so awful I l've only heard it when I planned my wedding \"do not play\" list.  

For appetizers we ordered the pizza special (amazing), arrancini (amazing), insalata di mare (quite unimpressive and mediocre) and fried anchovies (amazing). For dinner we ordered the halibut (overpriced and WAY over salted), the lobster ravioli special (super unflavorful, and underseasoned) and salsiccio pasta (decent). For dessert we ordered the cassato (good) and gelato (straciatella and pistachio - only the pistachio was good). 

On a finer point, it was seemingly a big deal to get new cutlery and side plates after our messy appetizers, and had we not asked for the table to be wiped of the oil that was spilled all over it, it would have remained oily and dirty. 

Over the course of the meal, the service continued to be unremarkable, and the food / atmosphere just ok at best. Wine selection was decent and affordable on a positive point! I would not come back again."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood!

Drinks are solid - very Italian, appetizers are tasty but on the small side.

Recommend the Gnocchi, nice light sauce - tasty without being too strong or piled on.

Will come back soon and report back!"}
{"text":"Ardo is located at King/Sherbourne with an open kitchen that serves traditional Sicilian dishes and pasta. I came by Ardo with a friend for dinner on a Wednesday night, we made reservations ahead of time. Service was attentive and friendly and we were given ample time to catch up without feeling rushed by the waitress. We both ordered pasta dishes (I got the salsiccia [orecchiette, house made Sicilian spicy sausage, Sicilian provolone, rapini, heirloom cherry tomatoes] and my friend got the funghi [Handmade gnocchi, local mushrooms, stracchino cheese, heirloom carrots, black truffle oil]). Both pasta dishes were delicious. We both also got drinks after dinner. Overall, good food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We came here for staff dinner on a Wednesday night. Overall great atmosphere and good food. The wine we chose was quiet enjoyable as well. But the food overall wasn't \"exceptional\"  as I'd expected - everything tasted fantastic but nothing stood out."}
