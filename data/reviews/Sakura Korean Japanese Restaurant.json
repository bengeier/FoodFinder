{"text":"I have been to this restaurant countless time and absolutely love it.  I think you get really good value for your money.  I normally get a bulgogi dinner box which comes with sashimi, dynamite rolls, rice, bulgogi, green salad, miso soup, potato and chap chae for $11.95.  It is a lot of food and feeds me for two meals.  There are 9 dinner boxes in total, varying from tempura to kalbi to chicken teriyaki.  There are also party trays, which are very reasonably priced compared to other restaurants.  The owner is very pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered their lunch special Salmon teriyaki bento box for $8.95+tax. Everything was good except the waitress didn't understand much English. Salmon was cooked well which I like but wish they given more on top of the meal. Also noticed the boiler room is in the men washroom lol!"}
{"text":"Came back again to celebrate i got a job offer! Me and my sister ordered sushi boat A and shrimp tempura. Everything is great! Sushi are well made and tempura r nice and hot! The only downside is... i dont know why every time i ate there there r a few fruit flies around which is kind of annoying."}
{"text":"Very inexpensive, specially the lunch specials, but the food is just ok. You won't go hungry, but your tastebuds won't be amazed either."}
{"text":"I've been to Sakura probably over 30 times in the past 5-6 years. It's not the best sushi restaurant in Toronto. What it is, is one of the best values in Toronto. I can have slightly higher quality sushi (not to say Sakura is poor quality) in other restaurants but I'm likely going to get less food and pay more money. There is a time and a place for when I want to spend more and get higher quality, but for a friday lunch, I will choose Sakura over many other places.  The service is pretty good, they get busy during working day lunches and sometimes wait times suffer, but I've been there enough to know to arrive at 11:30am or after 1pm just to be safe."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place for our weekly dinner as sushi was the pick. It's a cute and quaint little restaurant tucked away off of Yonge Street. Something cozy and not big corporate feel to it. Very fresh fish and a top sepler to me was that there was a little service button at each table so no hovering servers over serving you or forgetting that you're there.  Between the 3 of us we shared a few rolls and got a sizzling hot plate of spicy chicken. It was all delicious and even though it wasn't all you can eat it didn't break the bank at all. We each had a Sapporo each and with tip it all come to $100.   I would definitely go again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Been going here for a few years now and it's always a safe bet for above average sushi.  Service is prompt and they always bring you appetizers for groups of 2 or larger.  Sashimi is fresh, NEVER got sick from any food here.  They also have almost year round uni sushi which is hard to find in most sushi places. It is also fresh and tastes just like sea water.  Their tea is always nice and strong flavor.  Would recommend going there for a very satisfying  15$ / person meal!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for good, affordable sushi!   I've been eating there regularly for the past 8 years.  I wouldn't say their quality is the best, but it is always fresh.  They always start you off with free appetizers (\"panchan\" in korean) which include: vegetable pancake, honey glazed potatoes, edamame soy beans, yam glass noodles, and kimchi.  Sometimes you have to ask for the kimchi, as not everyone likes spicy preserved cabbage.  You can even ask for a second round of free apps!  I love their dragon rolls (tempura shrimp rolled inside) and their spicy salmon handrolls.  The bento boxes are a great deal, and their kalbi (korean bbq beef shortribs) are delicious.    Not-so-great eats for me have been: spider roll (the soft shell crab is panko breadcrumb crusted instead of tempura fried, I find it doesn't taste as good), sukiyaki (raw meats and noodles cooked in broth fondue style) and bibimbap (korean stone bowl rice dish, which was done poorly).  Also, the ventilation system in the restaurant is terrible.  Your hair and clothes will reek of tempura when you leave!  That's actually stopped me from going there on nights when I don't want to go clubbing after wards smelling of fryer oil.  I'm not joking, the smell is thick!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  That's  all. Oh, try the love roll, bulgogi, spicy chicken, spicy salmon roll and sushi pizza!  you're  welcome."}
{"text":"its cheap with friendly service but they made my sushi with regular plain rice instead of sushi rice (vinegar+sugar) so it tastes weird. later they found out but i disnt bother to tell them bc i was planning to never come back. instead of an apology i got a on the house almon handroll. BUT im never going back to eat there"}
{"text":"They have lunch special for $7.95 named from Monday to Saturday; you can pick any days.  We went there few times before; they were okay.  But recently, we tried Friday - the lunch special, chicken was so dry; I think they cooked a huge batch of chicken and put sauce on top when orders came.   Our foods were ready within 3-5 minutes - fast, very fast.  At least, the tempura is not prepared ahead of time.    3 stars for customer service. 1 star for food.     I will not go back after this experience..."}
{"text":"Food is consistent and good. Sushi is fresh with that soft melt in your mouth texture. One of the better tasting Korean restaurants in the area. Staff are friendly. Bento boxes and chicken don katsu are my fav!  Recommended.   Update: Been many times as it's one of my default places to go when I can't decide on another place. Food has been consistently good, and staff are always friendly. The decor may need an update, but I come for the food. Prices are reasonable. With take out, they always give bonus appetizers."}
{"text":"Mediocre food (obviously not authentic), limited choice of sushi. For real Japanese food fans this would never be a choice. While it's indeed pretty cheap and the size per serving appears to be huge, which may be good to those who are not satisfied with tiny servings of real Japanese dishes.  This place is run by Korean people so maybe they do a better job in Korean dishes, while I'm not familiar with Korean so I won't comment about their Korean food.  Pros:    -   Low price, large servings    -   Staffs are friendly  Cons:    -   Not authentic for their Japanese dishes"}
{"text":"Best all you can eat with great portions and very fresh sushi. Definitely my go to place in the area. The service is pretty good as well and the staff are very friendly.  You must try it to believe it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great sushi places if you are looking for affordable sushi.   Like most sushi restaurants they have lunch deals -- which are bento boxes of your typical beef, chicken or salmon teriyaki meat, rice, salad, soup & fried tempera.   However, the reason why I keep going back here is because my friend is a HUGE fan of their hurricane roll -- which is deep fried roll with cream cheese, tempera & some other stuff + lots of spicy mayo sauce.  Just alone, this sushi roll is a heavenly delicious roll, but a heart arteries clogger!  -- I dare youuu to try it..!   Like most Korean places, once you place your order -- you get some yummie side dishes & cold half slice, cut in quarter orange --- along with  your cost of damage to your wallet.   This place is very casual, good to chill with friends or coworkers or in general a good inexpensive sushi place. Ideally, if it weren't for the hurricane roll, my friend was so obsessed with... I doubt I would be making weekly visits to this lovely sushi restaurant. However, I am sadly also a big fan of the hurricane roll.. cause it's just so darn good!   Ideally tho, it's better to go to this place with 1 or 3 people because you'll get a booth right away.  However, never did I have to wait for my seating.   Either way, the hurricane roll is won my vote as \" YAY! I'm a fan\" , so give it a try ! :)"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant when I was looking for a different sushi place to eat at. Because it said it was AYCE, my friends and I decided to go in and check it out. The layout is alright, nothing too fancy like the other sushi restaurants. The sushi was not bad but not the bad I've had. Dinner for AYCE is $19.95 weekdays so it's the average price for most AYCE sushi for dinner. I really enjoyed their special roll which was the white dragon. The one waiter (male) was very nice whenever I asked for more tea but the other waiter (female) was rude when I asked for more tea, she barely stopped when I waved her down, she walked past me as I told her I would like more tea and she did not have a very friendly facial expression. Also noted that on the wall beside each table there is actually a button to call more service, I did not figure this out till another customer told me. It is in a terrible spot where it is not noticeable and have no signs to indicate so, also the writing on the button is in Korean/Japanese, which I do not know the language of. The waiter should have told us from the beginning. Overall, it is okay if you're looking for AYCE sushi at a reasonable price.  Would I go back? Most likely not."}
{"text":"Just came back from another delicious meal here. Had the kalbi bibimbap - one of my all time favourite dishes!!!  Can't wait to come back here again. Amazing value for good quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices! I'm a regular here! Salmon Loves Roll and their bento boxes are the best! I also love the appetizers they give.  UPDATE: They now have All You Can Eat!"}
{"text":"It's another sushi place on Spring Garden. Sometimes I think Spring Garden should be renamed to Sushi Street.   It's immediately competing with Kiyomizu (higher end, but pricey) and Ichiban Fish (medium and slightly above average in price). Sakura is the cheapest of the 3 and the quality is also comparatively lower imo. It's like the 3 restaurants got together to determine which segment of customers to attract. Across the street is Sushi One which is also in the same league as Sakura, also with AYCE option. All 4 are Korean owned too.   When I think back to all the other AYCE sushi places I tried, Sakura is just so so. There are pros and cons.  Pros:  -Price is on point at $20 + tax/tip on a weekday -Chicken Katsu was well made. Some places make it with mostly batter and almost no meat. This place has one of the better katsu I've tried in the GTA. I also like how they give you the katsu sauce on the side so you can use as much as you like.  -Tempura is well made. The shrimp they use is slightly larger than what's used at some other places. Crispy but doesn't feel greasy.   Cons: -Very limited sashimi options. Only salmon, red snapper, surf clams. -They don't have squid/octopus/mackerel sushi. -There is something about the rice they used. It felt a little dry.  No other noteworthy points and most of the food was delicious. Sashimi is as fresh as your average AYCE place. Sushi and maki's rice-stuff ratio was good. There is nothing special on the menu that you can't find in other place.   Of course, if you don't get AYCE, you can get various standard Japanese/Korean fare.   Overall if you're not craving high end sushi, or you want AYCE sushi in the Yonge/Sheppard area, this is not a bad choice."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this restaurant for dinner. He suggested ordering one of 9 dinner boxes. I ordered box 3 and he ordered box 8 (photos below).  They started off by serving us complimentary tea and appetizers (including miso soup). Then our dinner boxes arrived. Salmon was the best item in the box hands down. It was fresh, moist, and tasty. Temporas and makis were meh. Portions are generous. Service is excellent. Prices are reasonable.  Overall A OK considering the price and portions. I would recommend this place for those who are hungry and in the area. However I would not recommend it for those who are craving authentic Japanese food."}
{"text":"Great bento lunch and dinner choices at a very reasonable price! Kalbi and sashimi are awesome."}
{"text":"I didn't even eat here.   We barely got through the door and sat down at the table. It was a tepid, humid temperature, which is never good for a restaurant that handles raw fish. We had just walked a long distance, so a few of us went in to use the bathroom. Kind of repulsive; who knows when it was last cleaned, despite the fact that this is where they store their cleaning supplies. Also, it's unclear whether this bathroom is designed for one person or many.   When I walked back to the table, I realized it was sticky. The soya sauce bottle was stuck to the table. That was pretty much the last straw. We got up and left."}
{"text":"Came here one night with a lot of family (10 people) because Ichiban was pretty packed. We got here at about 8 pm on a weekday night and we were the only ones here. A couple more people came in after we sat down but it was pretty dead. Well, we all got japanese food. I don't think any of us ordered anything off the Korean menu. Well. We all started off with some sushi rolls for appetizers. The fish was pretty fresh. I wouldn't say this was good sushi. It was more average. And I know my sushi. But at least it was fresh. The main courses started coming out. I got one of the hot rice dishes and the other people got some bento boxes. Well. They completely forgot my cousins order. So while I was waiting for her to get her food before I would start to eat, the waitress noticed that I was not touching my food. Everyone else had already started eating. Not very polite of them. Anyways, she asked me if everything was ok and why I was not touching my food. I told her it was because my cousin didn't have her order yet and I was not going to eat until she got hers. The waitress looked confused, looked at the ticket, and told me that she hadn't ordered anything.  Seriously?? I was right there when my cousin ordered and I specifically heard her order the sashimi boat. My cousin being very shy and quiet did not say anything so I ended up doing all the talking. The waitress apologized and went and put the order in which took about 10 minutes to come. How hard is it to cut 15 pieces of sashimi? You really need 10 minutes to do this? Maybe they should get a new sushi chef. Well. By now, my other cousin had stopped eating because I had stopped eating. My aunts and uncles decided that they did not care and kept on eating. 10 minutes later, my food was cold. Not very impressed. I doubt I'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"CLOSED :(  I'm so sad. It was my go-to spot for lunch and dinner whenever I didn't know where else to go.  They have the best prices and food was good with good side dishes (even as a takeout customer). My favourite has always been their Kalbi combo. Servers were very nice too.  You'll be missed~"}
{"text":"This has been my go to place for years for sushi. They always have great quality tasting food for a great price. They have all you can eat buffet nowadays.  But I still prefer just ordering one of their sushi boats or a bento box."}
{"text":"Food here is pretty good, but the best thing on the menu is the Spicy Salmon Maki - you can definitely taste the spice!  Philadelphia roll is pretty good, and the sushi pizza, was fairly good as well.  I'd recommend it for at least the spicy salmon maki! :)"}
{"text":"Ive been to all of the sushi in the neighbourhood and this one is certainly better than many of the other ones... perhaps Sushi One is probably on par with this restaurant. I think this store deserves some more attention.   The sushi boat, rolls and sashimi salad was amazing. I loved the sauce that went with the salad and they didnt skimp out on the amount of sashimi which I really appreciate. The quality of the sushi was top notch.   If theres anything to improve, I would suggest improving the potato side dish and maybe bring out some kimchi side dish as well. The tables were a little sticky and the place could use a bit of renovation. Just a suggestion.   Service wasnt the best but it is a pass on my books. I like the value and quality of the dishes and I will be coming back as long as you keep it up!"}
{"text":"I went here the other day for lunch with a good friend.  It was Monday around prime lunch time hour 12:00PM.  We must have arrived just before the rush because we were seated right away.  They have a great lunch bento box menu and relatively cheap - between $7-10.  There is also a daily special and is usually a really good deal.  My friend had the daily special, which was shrimp tempura, bulgogi, salad, some rolls and I believe rice, there was also miso soup for only $7.95. I had something from their lunch menu which came with some rolls and sushi, it was more than enough and it was $8.95, which is pretty decent.  Food came out fairly quick and the quality was very good!  The only thing that I can really complain about is the lack of service.  We maybe heard from the waitress 3 times...once when were seated, once when she took our order, and the other time when we asked for the bill.  Not a big deal though, because we weren't looking for her for anything else when we were eating our meal!  Overall, i would definitely come here again!  They also have great dinner specials from what i can see that are reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and the food is always yummy, friendly staff, delicious free starters!!"}
{"text":"When we first moved to Toronto, we stayed in a furnished condo a few blocks away from here and ate here at least once a week. Now, anytime we're in the 'hood, it's our go-to place for affordable Sushi, Bento and Korean.  Great prices, friendly staff (they remember us now years later!) and above average food in huge quantities.  Kids always get Bento boxes and I'm a fan of the Spicy Seafood Yaki Udon. Plenty of free apps with your meal and we always leave with enough food for another meal. Dining for under $10 a person. Plus take-out portions seem bigger than dine-in."}
{"text":"Worst panchan I've ever had in Toronto.  Soon dubu is passable at best."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and they have not changed their prices!  I've always ordered dinner bento box #9 which is the best deal. The box includes 9 pcs of sashimi, 4 pieces of sushi, soup, salad, rice, vegetable tempura and lobster tail tempura, all for $13.95 + tax. They also serve complimentary side dishes before your order. Service is good and food is fresh and delicious. The decor and ambience is decent, nothing fancy for this mom/pop shop.  We will continue to come back as long as they're serving this bento box."}
{"text":"Sad that you have closed. What happened??!! You were so generous with appetizers and flavours were great. Goodluck in your endeavours!"}
{"text":"Sakura was simewhat of a mixed experience. I'm not exactly sure how we ended up here, but it might have had to do with the fact that it was past 10 pm and there seemed to be a good number of patrons here.  First, note on the food is that this is a Korean 'Japanese' restaurant. This means you will have a more extensive menu with many Korean options. While I would have loved to try some meat dishes 'a la carte' they were all annoyingly mixed into combos or bentos I was not at all interested in! We ended up ordering 8 rolls most of which were decent and fairly priced. The 'Salmon-Love' roll and spicy Salmon stood out. I also noticed the tuna, while sparse was fresh!  Just so you know, the little button on the wall is to call the server. Don't press it 10 times in a row and on the other hand don't sit idly expecting to be served! I can not make too many comments on the service since we were served by at least 3-4 different people through the night.  There were also a few little quirks about Sakura: the right side of the restaurant is considerably warmer than the other half (we actually preferred the 'warmer' side). This is due to a dish washer that is probably too close to the seating area. The other quirk is the bathroom which has a sink for washing clothes, a washing machine and finally a vacuum! Furthermore the actual toilet (can't believe I'm writing this) was almost definitely intended for a daycare centre.   All in all a decent experience but I'm not exactly dying to go back."}
