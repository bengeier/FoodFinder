{"text":"Killer tortillas for great price ! Get the 15\" 50oz tortillas for the double wrap on your burritos."}
{"text":"Tiny bakery off Broadway and Central on the East side of the street.  This place is cash only.  The lady at the counter is extremely friendly and helpful.  I picked up a couple pumpkin empanadas, small flour tortillas, wheat tortillas, and some chicharrones all for about 7 bucks.    The tortillas were hot and fresh.  The chicharrones were crisp, hot, juicy, and salty.  Delicious, but do t eat too many.  These little greasy devils will clog your arteries up in no time.  The pumpkin empanadas were good but not the best I've had.  A little on the rich side.  Could have used a touch of sweeetness inside and out.  This place also makes some awesome torta and hot dog buns.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge quesadilla fan. I'm also a big fan of fresh food. In addition to that, as often as possible I like to be a patron of the small locally held businesses in the area where I live. I like spending my money there because they spend their money here and we all know that's good for the local economy. Okay so here we go.  This place has a pretty big blue sign on the front of the store. They have a half a dozen or so parking spaces of their own in front. It's nothing to look at but what goes on under the hood is pretty darn special. There is only about 5' x 12' of walking space in front of the counter. Directly in front of you when you walk in the door there are pork rinds, Cabeza, Cow Tongue and a few other traditional Mexican entr√©es nicely seasoned and cooked. In the back behind the counter you can see through an open door, a team of folks working hard and making tortillas. This is what I was here for. Now over to your right they have prepackaged in a few different denominations and sizes fresh tortillas made probably only earlier that day and packaged right there on the spot. I bought myself a dozen 12 inch flour tortillas for $1.98 . . . . I couldn't wait to rip open the package and try one right outside the store (I ended up eating three)  Yummy ! All I can say now is I don't know if I can go back to the ones I used to get at Fry's. If any of you have ever had fresh flower tortillas you already know what I'm talking about. Check it out for yourself!!"}
{"text":"Please people disregard the first four reviews. I wish I had,, what this place is, ishands down the crappiest tortillas I ever had. I think at one time they made very decent ones from the reviews. I dont think these people are not aware of what they eat. I purchased some today and they aren't good enough for hungry dogs. If u warm them up WOW they turn into a hard crumb making mess. Chicharones are okay a little salty but good. As far as sweet breads I did not buy, but they looked tasty. Drive as far as you have to to find Carolina's Restaurant there are a few in town now."}
{"text":"The Tortillas were soft, fresh and chewy. I love the variety and different sizes they make. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite tortillas ever. Soo delicious the food there is great too. I get some of the pork and rice and a bag of tortillas.  Booom I got a great meal. I'm drooling  thinking about this place again"}
