{"text":"This place is insanely overpriced, with extremely slow service. 

First of all, they charge for water. You have to pay 1.50 to buy a bottle of water. What?! My friend is on medication that dehydrates her and requires her to drink a lot of water. She went through her first bottle pretty quick. It's unfair, and even illegal, for an establishment to charge for water. 

Secondly, they don't serve alcoholic drinks, but their drinks are priced even more than most places would charge if they had alcohol in it. 10 dollar milkshakes? Why? I paid $4.50 for half a small mug of barely warm hot chocolate. 

Additionally, we kept trying to flag down the waitress to order something and she just kept walking past us and not even looking at us. There were only 3 other tables with customers in the whole place. Later, while she was still working, she was sitting down and smoking Shisha with her friends. Also when we wanted to order something. 

All in all, it was a pretty frustrating experience."}
{"text":"It's a friendly place and causal setting. Great food and dessert! Sheesha is clean and tasty. I've been a few times before and one time they seemed to be short staffed but The owner goes above and beyond to accommodate everyone's requests despite of having few staff on hand. My friends and I enjoy our time there. The Belgian Chocolate shots are awesome too!"}
{"text":"Been to D2UE a couple times, the atmosphere is great, and their patio is nice. Great for evening hookahs and deserts, their desert menu is like no other. They offer fruit cocktails (emperor) a must try and fruit salads, asst deserts, crepes and waffles, my new favorite is the triple chocolate crape, absolutely delicious!! As for the food menu, everything is good, my favorite is the chicken skewers served with rice, fries or salad, hummus. Great Value. And when you end your night, treat yourself to a single or double shot of Belgian Chocolate."}
