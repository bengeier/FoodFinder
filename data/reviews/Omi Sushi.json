{"text":"The sushi here is amazing!  The all you can eat sushi lunch is slightly cheaper than Makimoto and although the decor lacks energy,  it really is an under-rated spot in Scarborough. The service does take a while, but it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"A hidden AYCE sushi place on 16th and Bayview and it was worth the hunt. I find most AYCE restaurants like Kiku and Kaka taste all the same but they charge a lot more. WHY!?!?!?! Imagine our joyous surprise when we found Omi Sushi. The quality, tempature and portion of the nigiri were spot on. Of all the different dishes we tried, I was impressed by their TAKOYAKI aka Octopus Balls. For once, a shop that didn't serve those tiny frozen takoyaki you can get at the grocery stores. Dinner was $22.99 on weekdays and I think $24.99 on weekends?"}
{"text":"So I pretty much come here every week cus it's a good deal for all you can eat and I love down the street. The food is amazing... The store is okay... But service ok.. Let's talk about service now. I always get this waitress that has this sour look on her face.. She looks like she doesn't even wanna work there. If you aren't a people Person why the fuck are you serving ? She doesn't smile, she doesn't greet people, she doesn't check up on people, it's annoying and she clearly doesn't care about her job. The other waitress ( I don't know her name) I think she has red hair, skinny and very tall. She's so nice. Once in awhile when I get her and she serves me. Best SERVICE EVER. she checks up on me, smiles and at least tries to be friendly. I think that's enough for the rant lol but I think you get it... Good food... Just a shitty ass server! I don't know how she's still even there"}
{"text":"Summary = food is good, decor not so much, not overly busy, only order the AYCE menu, very fast to receive food  ----  Have visited this place twice since it opened and would definitely come back again.  as my summary says, only choose the AYCE as it is the best deal and you do not have to to worry if the kitchen 'misses' a dish or you think the place size is too small, as you just order again!  Staff is quick and efficient, however they take your order at the table manually themselves.  I find at these AYCE it is better for them to give you a list and you check off what you want instead (like Makimono).  That is probably what I would change about this place.  Don't come here for the decor or ambience.  Come here for the sashimi (medium to large slices and not paper thin like other places), the rolls are decent and the grilled items are good too.  Selection is not as large as Makimono or others, however there is no rush here and I do not think it ever fills up the whole dining room, and you can bring your kids or larger groups without worry like other places.  There is enough people for the food to turnover and overall was a decent experience, worth returning, just don't expect more than that."}
{"text":"Super annoyed. Be aware. Online menu prices and actual prices in store are VERY DIFFERENT. I get that I should have double checked when I placed my order, but the party tray I ordered had 20 dollar difference. 20 DOLLARS!! Also, place your orders early. Was told it would take 30 min but it took 50min. Sushi is nothing special. Won't be coming here again. The restaurant should update their prices online!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Never again! I hate this place it took them literally 15 minutes to bring us our first glass of water and the waitress forgot to place our first order so after 45 minutes of waiting we decided to leave...it was RIDICULOUS!!"}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite. Best sushi in Scarborough. Really good and fresh. Service is sometimes slow"}
{"text":"The food is decent for all you can eat, and quite a good selection. The service however is horrible. They don't have enough cooks to meet the capacity of the restaurant. We didn't get our food for half an hour... And people who came in after us for served first. Don't come unless it's empty because you'll wait forever for food"}
{"text":"So glad that they finally opened a good Japanese restaurant in Scarborough. I used to drive so far to get this kind of food. I have been here many time and the food is always fresh and the staff is very polite. I saw someone say in their comments that they aren't good but let me tell you, I used to go to HWY 7 and Kennedy and some restaurants downtown and although the food there was good the staff was rude. I am hard to please so I know this place is great! It's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is totally opposite, very very slow, only one waitress and only one chef working when we went today for lunch. People who came after us and sat in the table next to us got their food before us and we kept waiting...I had to get up and get my own wasabi and ginger even after asking for it twice.  It seems other people have had similar experiences. It's price point for the lunch buffet is good and so is the food, however don't have too much expectations on the service."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  I've lowered my score for 4 stars to 1. The reason for this is because they now refuse to serve me anymore for pretty much no reason at all.   I asked for the bill after I was finished eating and the waitress (who I also assume is the manager or owner since I saw her dealing with a health inspector recently) just said to me whilst I was paying that they will no longer be serving me.  I've been a loyal customer since I discovered them a couple months ago and I enjoyed my time there, but refusing to serve a loyal customer is just not good business. I'll probably order delivery from here if I feel like it, but I guess I'll have to explore other nearby options.  Again, great food, but horrible service. The manager is completely inhospitable. The one waitress who's actually nice only works on weekends or something, so if you'd like to go and get decent service, go then. They should be ashamed of themselves.  If you're looking for AYCE sushi, you can go here but just keep in mind that the only real bonus here is the $13 AYCE. Most other AYCE ask for $15, but if that means you get better service, I'd go there instead. It's only $2 anyways.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I basically go here on a weekly basis because of the $13 all you can eat and because its about 5 minutes away from home and I pass it every day when I'm going to college.   The food tastes awesome. I usually get some California rolls, Alaskan rolls, Rainbow rolls, tobiko rolls and some salmon and red snapper sushi.   My main complaints with the place lies with the service.   From what I can tell, there are only ever 3 waitresses (usually 2 on weekdays). Two of the waitresses come across as very rude some times. There's another waitress that always greets you with a smile and always makes sure everything is okay, but the other two really act as though they could care less.   The food can sometimes take very long to come, usually when its your second order. This problem probably stems from the fact that there's only one chef. They should really try hiring another to speed things up.   So to sum up:  PROS = $13 all you can eat on weekdays(!), great tasting food, not usually crowded, close by, does delivery.   CONS = Two inhospitable waitresses, one chef, sometimes there are long wait times."}
{"text":"I've been to Omi Sushi one before with my brother when it first opened so when it came to choosing a decent AYCE (all you can eat) in the area, it was definitely one of the options. Sushi is my favourite food so I get quite critical about how a restaurant creates their maki rolls, handrolls, sashimi, and sushi. Having tried this restaurant once before, I was hoping that the second experience would not disappoint.  My boyfriend and I wanted in at about 11:45am for lunch. It was completely empty with only a waitress and sushi chef talking behind the counter. We were quickly greeted and sat down in a booth that seemed way too spacious. The seats were fairly comfy and also the decor of the restaurant worked as it was a very neutral colour scheme with minimalistic decorations.  We quickly scanned the menu looking for anything delicious and we ordered our first round of food. The waitress was quick to take our order sheet and brought us over tea and water. My boyfriend ordered miso soup, tom yum soup, chicken teriyaki, 2 types of beef udon. I ordered the seaweed salad, teriyaki calamari, fried calamari, salmon rose sushi, salmon sushi, crunchy salmon roll (...I just really like salmon, okay?) and the banana shrimp roll.  The soup and salad were quick to come, along with something unexpected. The soy sauce was brought out in a broken sugar container with plastic wrap covering the top. It was difficult to pour as the vessel split over the sides. Not exactly the best container to put soy sauce in but I'm not here to review their soy sauce dispenser. I digress.   The seaweed salad was cold so it was probably just taken out of the fridge, it tasted like any other pre-made pre-store bought seaweed. Nothing special.  The Calamari was the next to come out. The teriyaki calamari was quite a small portion and they might have over done it with sesame seeds. Overall it was lackluster, seems as though they just boiled frozen calamari and poured salty teriyaki sauce over it. The fried calamari was no different, it had the same chewiness except it was drenched in fried tempura batter that made it super greasy and heavy to eat.  I really wanted to love this place, I honestly did. The only thing that could salvage this would be the sushi itself. Luckily it was the next thing to come out. The crunchy spicy salmon rolls were decently sized, they were cut a bit uneven but it wasn't over packed with rice. I enjoyed the balance of the spiciness and it was nice that it didn't over power the salmon taste. However, the crunchy pieces were more soggy than anything, adding no taste nor texture to the rolls.  The salmon sushi was disappointing. It took two pieces of salmon for them to cover one piece of rice. The fish didn't seem very fresh but that's what I kinda expected going into an AYCE place like this. The salmon rose sushi had a dollop of something unrecognizable on top, turns out the sushi chef decided to blend the tobiko with the Japanese mayo, creating this strange pink sauce. It was way too overpowering and I had to wipe nearly all of it off before I could eat it. The banana shrimp roll was alright, I enjoyed the contrast of the sweet and savory but it's not something I would order again.  The off-putting-ness of the sushi made me decide that I would not order anymore sushi for round 2. Instead, I opted for some of the other tempura, shrimp and eggplant to be more specific and some shrimp chips. I normally don't order shrimp tempura at places like this because I know they heavily batter it up which makes it really filling but I wanted to give this a try. When the dish came, it was exactly what I had expected, a overly greasy and heavily battered piece of shrimp. I had to tear off the tempura bits before I could eat it. The eggplant turned out to be really soggy, as if they had forgotten to dry the eggplant before battering it and frying it. The shrimp chips tasted of used oil and was one of the biggest regrets of the overall order.  I was ready to just order ice cream and get on with it. So we took a look at their dessert menu, I got a scoop of strawberry ice cream and a scoop of mango with a fried banana. The ice cream was okay, again, nothing special. The fried banana was pretty meh too.  So my second trip to this place was a pretty big disappointment. I'm starting to wonder if places are giving up on quality and creativeness and going straight for whatever makes them the most money. Then again, that's what these restaurants are all about right? A gouge out of our wallets and a belly full of grease."}
{"text":"We came with a party of 6 to use a dealuse deal... 1. No service, we stood waiting for a good 15 minutes before even getting acknowledged. 2. Service is so slow...they served everything BUT our sashimi..all filler food...1.5 hrs in and we didn't get any sashimi/sushi... 3. Dishonest...they advertise AYCE crab legs...and we were eating that because No other food was being brought. After about 4 orders (which is not a lot for a party of 6 mind you) the server told us they are sold out. 10 minutes later they r bringing out crab legs to the table next door. UGH if u wanna put a limit on food fine but if u advertise AYCE then I expect that. 4. Scallop sashimi was slimey and fishy tasting...and salmon sashimi half frozen. My mother in law actually said out loud \"wow that's really cold!\" The fried Kalahari and coconut shrimp was overfried and dry..everything else is average  On the plus side, the place is cheap...22.99 for dinner...24.99 for weekends...but you get what you pay for. Drinks not included.  Its 10pm now..we arrived at 7...and I'm still waiting for dessert...I'd have to be really out of options to consider coming back here tbh.  I'd rather pay a couple bucks more and get better service. No one wants to spend 3 hours for dinner waiting half the time for food."}
{"text":"Sushi was decent...the company we were with made it just that much better. Was fed a lot and full.  Skip the fried bananas..tasted like bananas in tempura batter. Slip the spring rolls and dumplings.  The Korean short ribs were spongy and difficult to chew.   The sever (one of them) seem to be always grumpy. Gave us the bill before our last order and before us asking and looked annoyed when we said we were still waiting. I guess when we ordered desert that's the clue...  Anyways will go back but actually to try the Jamaican restaurant closed by (they were bbqing the her chicken out in the parking lot)."}
{"text":"Only the quality of the sushi and a couple of other dishes (such as the shrimp tempura)  keeps it from one star. Overpriced compared to other AYCEs, plus there are other financial caveats: - Sign indicates \"Grand opening 10% off\" and nothing else, but was told this only applies to take-out - There's a 10% service surcharge applied to your bill that is mentioned nowhere (neither on the menu or signage.) - Lunch price is $14.95 on the weekends, which is at the highest end for AYCE and the food does not reflect this. - Service was slow and waitresses seemed more interested in gabbing with each other than serving, even with hardly any customers  The sushi was good... the fish was very fresh and was well-presented. But the miso soup was about the worst I've ever had, like flavourless warm water with flour in it, the green tea tasted weird like it was made with grass, the fried bananas were actually made with unripe/green bananas.  I've had way better for $11.99 at other AYCEs in the GTA, and without feeling swindled. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I'm unimpressed. My folks and I went to this location on Friday night, November 20, 2015, and ordered 3 dishes: Vegetable Red Curry, Vegetarian Sushi Platter, & Vegetarian Sushi Pizza. *The curry arrived first, followed by the platter, then the pizza; the gap between service was so long that the curry was finished and the plate ready for collection before the sushi dishes were served. None was particularly flavourful.  *The music from the adjacent Jamaican restaurant (Spice It Up) was so loud that I could hear it through the (closed) windows. *We had to ask the waitress twice for water.  As with previous occasions when I have visited, on this occasion the restaurant was not busy. After this experience, I know why that's the case."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service Ive ever experienced at a restaurant.   All you can eat? More like all you can wait as you are digesting the little bit of food that you just had so you wont be able to eat any more.  The service had pretty much non existent.  Food was sub par.  We had to bring our own tea kettle to the back to ask for a refill as we stood there to wait for them to hand the kettle back to us to walk back to our own table.  We also had to go back and get our own wasabi and pickled ginger.  Only a quarter of our food came when the order paper was filled out and handed in.  None of the special rolls we ordered came.  Best part was the ice cream.  The bill came quick.  Like they were trying to get rid of you.  I see some people calling it a hidden gem... i think it might as well just be hidden cuz they are severely understaffed to run as an operation."}
{"text":"Quite restaurant with great ayce sushi. I went on Sunday for a nice lunch.  Great service as we were the only people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I read the reviews here before I tried this place. Basically, I understood that I would be gerttig terrible service, which isn't too bad at an all uu can eat sushi place because you don't spend a lot of time placing an order with a server. That being said, let's continue.  The sushi here is not amazing. In comparison to every other place I've been to, this place is terrible.  I was greeted when I walked in by the chef, although I did not know at the time that he was the chef. I waited for five minutes for a menu, wondering why the man who greeted me wasn't bringing me a menu. A lady came out and I got the ordering paper and a pencil. I put in an order.  Before I keep going, I am going to mention that my boyfriend and I were the only two in the restaurant.   We waited for fifteen minutes before they brought over two hand rolls and sashimi. We finished that, waited another ten minutes for some more food, finished that, and then waited about twenty minutes for the rest of our order. It took long because they had a walk in take out order. As there is only one chef, he had to make the take out. Honestly, that wouldn't even be bad to us if the service was quick and the food was good.  That being said, the tempura flakes in the sushi were stale. The hand rolls were so full of rice that I had to take rice out of it. When I read over the ordering sheet, I wasn't even aware they had hand rolls.   At this point, the take out had been finished, they handed us some more sushi, then gave us another ordering paper. We hadn't even received half of our first order. We placed a second order. Again, we're getting stale tempura flakes. The \"spicy salmon tuna\" is served on stale shrimp crackers with stale tenpure flakes, and barely and of the meat, and we didn't even get the spicy salmon sashimi we ordered. I ordered an octopus ball, which was a ball of rice deep fried with the tiniest piece of octopus in the center. The worst part was how awful it tasted. My boyfriend went to the bathroom while I tried it, and I squashed his into a napkin to spare him from eating it.  We got ice cream. My ice cream was freezer burned. My boyfriend got the strawberry ice cream, which had so much frozen strawberry jam on the bottom that it became sickening after. We paid then, and left, vowing never to go back."}
{"text":"the worst sashimi ever had in Toronto, so unfresh, rolls r just ok, they use sauce and seasonings to cover the bad texture of the ingredients"}
{"text":"I have been to Omi Sushi many times . It is a great price for all you can eat. The waitresses are friendly once you get talking to them. Very good tasting food my favorites are the salmon roses the crunchy spicy salmon rolls the salmon sushi and the eel sushi ."}
{"text":"The price is good for AYCE, compared to AYCE sushi places downtown. Atmosphere and decor was nicer than I was expecting.  The menu was extensive and provided many options. We requested salmon maki, which wasn't listed on the menu, and they were able to make it for us. We ordered mostly salmon, cucumber and tuna sushi, tempera, teriyaki chicken and hashbrowns. Everything I tried was good, no complaints! Service was quick and staff were pleasant.    I would definitely go back to Omi Sushi again."}
{"text":"I have never posted a review on Yelp before, but I felt that this place really hits below expectations, which isn't fun for anyone. I have come here routinely with friends for Lunch AYCE ever since they opened and the food was never really amazing, just mediocre. It seems to have gone down the drain since then, along with their service.   I wish I could take off another star for poor service. Every time I have come here, service has never been phenomenal, but the last time I went, it was really really bad. The waitress (if I can even call her that) seemed to be annoyed from the second me and my friends sat down, thrusting menus at us and then subsequently ignoring us for 20 minutes.  Every time she brought our food around, she wouldn't bother to set it down and clear the table. In the end, my friends and I had to clear the tables ourselves, piling up our plates in the corner so that we could make space for the food that was arriving. At one point, instead of making space for a plate, the waitress just put the plate of hot food in my friend's lap! I was outraged and shocked that she would treat paying customers like this - and recurring customers at that.   She wouldn't come over when we waved her down, she would only take a plate or two after we cajoled her into clearing the table for us, she smirked at us when we asked for the fees for taking home sushi ($1 a piece, by the way. Beware because they don't tell you the price beforehand, not that I'm recommending this place to anyone) and was just downright rude. It wasn't just our table, I noticed - she would disappear into the kitchen for long periods of time, while other tables would look around and wonder what was going on.  On top of that, the food isn't that great. I've tried better sushi at Pacific Mall, believe it or not. You can tell the fish isn't fresh and all the tempura we ordered was dripping in grease. Mango rolls used to be a favourite of mine until I ordered it here. Mango rolls at this place equate to a slab of rice with a mash of mango and fish placed on top, sloppily held together by a string of seaweed. Not just unappetizing to the eyes.  I've tried the sushi, sashimi, greasy tempura, soups, side dishes right down to the sushi pizzas, chicken wings and fries, and I can easily say the one consistently good thing here is the canned soda.   It wasn't just AYCE, turns out. A friend of ours came in repeatedly while we were eating lunch and we noticed her enough times to ask what was going on. Apparently she had ordered take-out, but the restaurant repeatedly got her order wrong and threw random substitutes in her order instead.   TLDR; Bad customer service paired with less-than-mediocre food doesn't make up for the slightly lower prices. Grab a buck or two more and take a drive over to Makimono's for better food and better customer service."}
