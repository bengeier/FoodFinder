{"text":"This was a new place for us and we loved it!  I ordered a couple of items i know and a couple that were new. One of the new items was the bread with cream cheese and jalapeño stuffed.  Soooo good!  Light fluffy and good flavor. The only item that was my least fave was the churro. It was too hard for my liking and the center was filled with dulce.  This place was clean and friendly service."}
{"text":"Honestamente el pan es delicioso y el lugar se ve limpio pero la persona que nos atendió aparentemente dudo de nuestra honestidad por un reclamo que hicimos sobre un pan que ellos olvidaron darnos. Big deal !! 90 centavos! Obviamente fue bochornoso y se siente uno mal que piensen que uno quiere robarles un pan de 90 centavos"}
{"text":"The pastrys here are delicious its always very fresh but they don't have that much of a selection they do have more than just pastry tho like they have milk cake and jello so that might make up for it and the worker was nice so overall this is a good place to go if you want some pastrys"}
{"text":"The champurrado was delicious... at first my husband and I were debating wether to have it or not, after our first sip we absolutely fell in love with it. It is delicious!!!!!!! Yumm!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good. But the service and quality of baked good has gone down hill. Oh well time to look for a new panadería."}
{"text":"Came in today to try it out and left disgusted. I walked in with my cousin looking to pick up some pan dulce. The place looked relatively clean, but the lady working was unaware that while she had a conversation with a client, there was a line waiting to pay.  As she finished taking the order for a cake, she moved on to the next client. But before she starts, she uses her hand to cover her coughing. A full on cough into left hand, then she does it again. The disgusting part was that she didn't wash her hands, continued to open a paper bag and place the customers items into the bag. With those dirty hands, she grabs 3 plastic sheets to individually wrap 3 somewhat moist items and place it into the bag. That is completely disgusting and dirty! Oh and she handled the last transaction, by grabbing money and still not washing her hands.   I left what I wanted on the tray and walked out. That was one of the nastiest places I've ever seen. This place is nasty and disgusting. Will definitely not recommend this place to anyone. I'd give it 0 stars if it was an option."}
{"text":"Grab a tray and fill it up. great sweet breads, always fresh, good selection of cookies, paletas and other yummy things."}
{"text":"There is A LOT to choose from here, churros, cakes, cookies, paletas, etc.. You just go in, grab a tray and go to town, great prices too! We were able to get three huge pasties for a little over $3 wow! You don't really notice this place driving by but it's a definite must try when you have craving or want to remember all the yummy sweet breads from your childhood. Can't wait to return and try even more!"}
