{"text":"Awesome sandwich, was fresh and crispy! Going to drive from Toronto there for another one, very easy to access from the 400. Must try!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan, this is a great place to go for a Veal sandwich or to grab a slice of pizza!

Veal Sandwich, Steak Sandwich (4/5): Yum! Veal is thin and lightly breaded. They stack generous layers in the sandwich and the bread legit. Doesn't fall apart in your hands, holds everything together well and is crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. The veal itself is soft to the bite and the sandwich is gigantic! Standard order comes with regular sauce, however I would have liked more of it. The steak sandwich is new. Its similar to the veal except with thinly cut portions of steak. The bread is different but same top notch quality. Although a great sandwich, my loyalty lies with the veal :)

Pizza (4/5): Holy moly! These slices are HUGE! It's 1 quarter of the XL pizza, but its made fresh in front of you and the cheese and pepperoni slices are great. What i particularly like is that its thin crush and the pepperoni slice slightly thicker!

Cost (4/5): $3.75 for a quarter of a pizza that's a steal! However, its around ~$8 for a sandwich. Still pretty good for the gigantic meal you get!

Service (3.5/5): As in other reviews sometimes the cashiers may seem dis interested, but they will accommodate requests without questions. Feel free to call in before hand to place your order and have it ready on your arrival!

The place (3/5): Spacious for large groups and in general clean. Nothing to special though, good enough for a quick bite!

Overall would recommend if you're in the area, but I'll still be looking around for that ultimate veal sandwich!"}
{"text":"I come here a lot, as its around the corner from where I live, and I have to say this has to be the best sandwich place around. It is always made fresh, the food is consistently good and the service is always amazing. 

I order the grilled veal scallopini with tomato sauce and cheese occasionally adding rapini and every time it is hot, tasty and the bread is always fresh. 

I can't say enough about the ladies behind the counter they are always pleasant and helpful. 

Amazing place all around with delicious food!"}
{"text":"I used to live in the Woodbridge area for quite a while, and I never checked out this restaurant. A couple of people at work always said they had really good food. 

On my break I decided to get myself fries and chicken parmesan. It's only 5 minutes from my work, so I was able to grab it just in time. The fries were amazing. They were crispy and fresh. A lot better than fries at other restaurant. The Chicken was good too. But the portion is really big so I split it with one of my co-workers. Even having half of the sandwich is filling for one person. 

Another good thing is you can always order ahead and by the time you get there the food is ready. Even the ladies at the store are really patient and helpful. I have gone to this place twice already and I would most definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I arrived to see 1/2 the Veal Cutlet Panini leftover on my Plastic Tray.  I told my Friend I would arrive within 10 minutes and to go ahead and order!  I never expected within that time that the Panini would be ordered + prepared + EATEN.

Lesson: Never tell my Friend to order first!  She makes it all disappear!

A few other Panini Shops in the Woodbridge/Maple area are made to order.  Although that means the WAITING time increases, it makes for a better Panini especially if you order anything that needs to stay crisp such as a Veal Cutlet which is my standard comparison for Panini Shops.

No surprises here.  A regular Veal Cutlet Panini($6.15) and standard to most Panini places, some toppings are additional but my \"Friend\" got the Medium Hot Peppers so I wasn't able to taste their Marinara Sauce as-is.  Even at that it still seems like your run-of-the mill Sandwich that you can enjoy while watching CP24."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a really long time!  The veal cutlet sandwich with cheese is easily best in GTA and the portion size is very generous.   Definite repeat when in the area!"}
{"text":"We live downtown but always try to swing by when passing through the area, everything is excellent.  The panini, rice balls, baked good,  Awesome stuff, at a good price and a great homestyle flavour to it. 

Also have ordered the lasagna for holiday dinners and when entertaining. It's classic, old school, gooey saucy awesomeness and really once of the best we've ever had.  They do offer this as a special one day a week, can't remember which.  But we just order it a week or so ahead of time through email and and it's ready for pick up on the date requested.  

The younger folks that work register can sometimes seem disinterested, seem annoyed to be there, or into their phones which unfortunately isn't the best face for the business .  But the older folks there are super friendly and rightfully proud of the food.  Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Expensive and they don't give you much.  None of the food taste as good as they price themselves on.  I guess it used to be the best in Toronto but then they just rode that to long"}
{"text":"This place is terrible for getting the orders right ! Honeslty everytime my family goes there to get an order every order is spewed up! Just this week again order veal with mushrooms get no mushrooms this green stuff on the bread like seriously. I heard the order being taken on the phone so no excuse ! Terrible get it right !"}
{"text":"Now I know why I never wear anything white! 

The Veal Cutlet Panini ($6.15) I ordered is A-OK! The veal is soft and tender.. and I was hungry so I wolfed that down so fast! 

Tons of Marinara Sauce spiced with Medium Hot Peppers..(if not for my friend I would have ordered Hot Hot Peppers) oozing out and get on my face, my finger, my hands and even my camera! Probably on my top too but my burgundy sweaters will hide all those stains!

The only toppings that is free is the peppers... anything else is extra..

Since all the meat are premade, so they just put the sandwich together in a few minutes... good to come here if you want a quick bite or a takeout!"}
{"text":"What has happened here? It used to be friendly, reliable and offer a fresh panini.

Today I went in and the place was quiet (there was one customer seated). The cashier seemed as though she could care less whether I was there or not. She just stared at me waiting for my order. I ordered a breaded chicken panini, with cheese and hot peppers, to go.  2 items...not hard to mess up......whoa......maybe they can.
When I got to where I was going and bit into the panini expecting some mild heat from the peppers. Nada. Thinking that they may not be throughout the panini, I bit again, then again, then again. No hot peppers. Took the panini apart and nada....not a hot pepper in sight. Guess the 2 additional items was a bit much for either the cook or the cashier.
On a plus side, the bun was fresh.
Total, including a Fresca, came to $10.05."}
