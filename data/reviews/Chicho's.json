{"text":"This was my first time in this restaurant and I loved their Jalea  if you like Peruvian this is a great spot to try!"}
{"text":"We had the this platter with calamari, mussels, prawns, fish, sweet onions and tomatoes, was soooo good!!"}
{"text":"Énorme découverte ! Je recommande aux adorateurs de cuisine péruvienne et de plats a base de produits de la mer. Chicharron, Jalea et pastas au top ! C'est très copieux et vaut largement son prix, sans compter un accueil des plus chaleureux."}
{"text":"Tout étaient délicieux, le ceviche , la jalea , lomo saltado sans oublier le pisco sour ! Très bon service, j'y retournerai sans doutes."}
{"text":"When in Montreal craving Peruvian food, we happened to find Chicho's. About 3 miles from downtown we made the drive and it was on a busy street in the middle of Saint-Laurent boulevard.

We came around noon, it was completely empty with only one young girl as our server. She came over, greeted us, was sweet and respectable although, I don't think she spoke much English. I noticed this because whenever my boyfriend spoke in English she would kinda get confused and reply in Spanish. It wasn't a problem because we both speak it, we ended up just speaking to her in Spanish for the rest of the visit. But, this probably wouldn't be so favorable for someone who cannot speak or understand Spanish. 

Prices are a little on the pricy side. I don't think I'd make this place a regular spot for that reason, but from my experience of what I specifically ordered it was a huge portion. 

\"La Ronda Marina Calamar\"- this plate was 30$ and more than enough for two people. If you know me by now you know I eat a lot even though I'm small, I am really greedy and rarely can share food because I eat just about everything. But, in all seriousness, this plate was actually shareable and still had me full by the time I left. It brought ceviche, chicharron de calamar and arroz con mariscos. THE CEVICHE THOUGH. Simply amazing. Beyond flavorful and one of the best ceviches I have ever had. The seafood rice also hit the spot. I was impressed with everything and seriously craved more the following day.

I definitely would recommend this restaurant if you are in the area and want to try some bomb ceviche!"}
{"text":"Petit restaurent tranquille, nous fume étonner du bon goût de nos mets, Anticuchos ( brochettes de cur délicieuse avec patates au four et salade 13,99$) , Arroz chaufa con mariscos ( riz frit aux fruit de mer avec sauce soya 18,99$) et Milanesa de pollo ( poulet pané aux ufs servi sur riz et frites 14,99$).  Les assiettes sont de bonne portion et tout était vraiment bon. 
J'ai été surprise par les frites de coupe maison et délicieuse....
Nous conseillons fortement. Et 2 ado capricieux compris ;)"}
{"text":"Fantastic Peruvian food with gigantic (and I mean gigantic!) portions.  I guess you'd be tempted to call it a hole in the wall but I like the ambiance which largely consists  of a mural of a mermaid and a huge flatscreen television that blares (at least while we were there) the cheesiest Latino love balladeers this side of Julio Iglesias. Personally, I think it adds to the experience. The ceviche is one of the best I've ever had and the chicken I ordered was super tasty. Still, so much was leftover that I had to get a doggy bag - not a usual occurrence for me.  I was excited to have chicken for lunch the next day only to lose the brown bag at a bar an hour later. Oh well, I hope someone enjoyed it."}
{"text":"There were six of us.  We shared four dishes.  I imagine some of the others might pop in and give you their take but here is mine:

Service:  Friendly.  Prompt.  They speak Spanish, French, and English, BTW.

Beverages:  Okay, we all shared Inca Cola.  If you like Inca Cola, you'll be excited they have it.  If you've never had Inca Cola, it tastes like bubblegum meets marshmallow.  But it's yellow.  Weird, but sweet and palatable.

Okay the food...


-Ceviche Mixto:  One of the best ceviches I've ever had (and I've had a lot).  It was flavorful and SPICY.  Delightful.
-Fried fish (can't remember the name):  Less generic then you'd think.  Very good.  Not greasy.
-Anticuchos (beef heart):  I'll let others chime in on this.  This was my first ever heart so I don't have comparative analysis.  The leanest muscle, it is not fatty at all.  I have decided I prefer fatty meats, but it was flavored well and definitely edible.
-Saltado de Mariscos (a seafood with rice, veggies, and potatoes in a reddish sauce):  OMFG.  I want more of this today.  I want so much.  SO MUCH.   Why did I eat so much poutine earlier that I was full?  BOO.  Eat this.  Trust me.


Splitting the check, however, was an ordeal.  Do not expect this to be as easy as the rest of Montreal.  They don't get it.  They can split by dish, and that's it.  End of story.

That, however, wouldn't keep me from coming back.  Just bring cash."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly and it felt as if I came into a family restaurant with warmth and character.  I was served plantain chips and dipping sauce while I ordered and they perked me right up. What a great touch. I ordered the Arroz con mariscos and the jalea.  The jalea was good but I expected more variety than just calamari and fish other than the one shrimp they skewered on top.  What they lacked in variety they made up with quantity however, so I was content. The Arroz was full flavored and definitely hit the spot. My fiance was in heaven with the Arroz with its amazingly tender calamari and perfectly cooked rice. Definitely would come afain. The food was slow to come out but upon seeing the quantity and quality of the food I quickly dismissed my discontent. I love supporting family businesses where I can definitely feel the love put into the food."}
{"text":"Mon conjoint est Péruvien, je cuisine péruvien et j'ai essayé tout les resto péruvien de montreal... Chicho's reste le meilleur resto péruvien que j'ai mangé. El mero a lo macho est MALADE! Juste d'y penser j'ai envie d'y aller maintenant!
Bon je me calme. La papa a la huancaina comme entree est exquise.
L'assiette de chicharon de calmar est aussi un incontournable, environ 20$ le plat principal mais tu en rapportes à la maison.
À essayer sans faute dans une vie !!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing ceviche. Having just returned from Peru, I was craving some Peruvian food. So stopped in for lunch was not disappointed, very authentic and flavourful"}
{"text":"We came here on a saturday night at 8pm and the restaurant was empty. We wanted to try peruvian food for a while and since this one seems to have good reviews, we decided to try. We had ceviche, fish cake, rice and spicy shrimps. The food was fine but nothing special. It was pretty pricy for the taste. Wouldn't really come back here."}
{"text":"As I was discovering new parts of Montreal...I found this gem of a place.  I'm so glad that I did...just loved their Ceviche Mixto.  It was AWESOME!  Man, these guys don't play when it comes to their portions...so come with a hearty appetite and you won't disappointed.  I recommend that you try one of their drinks named \"Chicha Morada\"...it's made from Black Corn, and it's very good!"}
{"text":"Had the goat stew with beans and rice. It was great"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing! We had the \"Mero A Lo Macho\" dish and were completely blown away by how good it was. Caught me off guard. We were also served by an awesome waiter who talked about the food and the chef with complete admiration and appreciation. The place may not look it, but definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"This is an authentic Peruvian restaurant, and a pretty good one at that. I went there with a group of friends after a few beer at Vices et Versa across the road - it was a good combo, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it!

The key dish was the cerviche, and they didn't disappoint. We got the mixto, and it tasted great and had a good selection of seafood. Better than that, no one got sick! I don't mention that because we were worried (we wouldn't have ordered it if we were), just that there's always a risk when you're serving uncooked seafood - but hey, that's what cerviche IS.

We also had the anticucho (beet heart skewers), which is another Peruvian staple which they did well.

We got a few other side dishes (fish, vegetables, etc) which were all nicely done. 

The place is nothing too special to look at, but the service was quick and friendly.

This place serves up Inka Cola, which is another must-have for any real Peruvian restaurant. If you've never had it before, give it a try (it looks like pee, but tastes like bubblegum!)."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great service. And again awesome authentic Peruvian food.  You can tell everything is made with love.  The chef. He is so nice. Came out said hello. Asked if he could make my husband something special.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night. It was quite quiet, so we sat ourselved to a table. The waiter was very friendly and gave us a starter of plantains and sauces. He carefully explained the sauces and handed us the menu. The menu had great options with lots of peruvian options. We decided to go with the famous $30 seafood platter and the beef hearts.  I was pretty disappointed on their ceviche though. It was way too salty and we had to return it. The calamari was OK and the rice was pretty good. I found the 2.50$ price tag for a can of Inka Kola too pricey. I have tried other peruvian restaurants in montreal, and this wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Surprenant! Je suis allée au Chico's après un après-midi à prendre quelques bières au Vices & Versa. On voit la pancarte illuminée à partir de l'intérieur du bar, et en lisant le seul autre avis qui avait été écrit à propos de ce resto Péruvien, on a remarqué qu'il avait été rédigé par quelqu'un de très critique donc, on s'est dit que vu la cote assez haute, ça devait valoir le coût. Et on a eu raison de l'essayer. C'était délicieux, généreux comme portion (à 6 personnes on s'est séparé 4 plats) et c'était très épicé. Bon, j'avoue que bien que j'aime ça épicé et chaud, ma tolérance est un peu, beaucoup, plus basse que je ne le voudrais, ou même que je l'admets. C'est la deuxième fois que je mange du péruvien et donc je ne suis pas une experte, mais tout était plein de saveur, les viandes et les fruits de mers cuits à perfection et tout ça à un prix raisonnable. C'est aussi un bon endroit si vous parlez espagnol avec les serveurs, ou si comme moi, vous voulez le pratiquer."}
