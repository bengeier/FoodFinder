{"text":"Great concept.  Small bar with good beers on tap.  Beer selection is not that extensive. However, that's not the point. I was in the area and stopped by to get some seasonal Fat Heads 4-packs (hop stalker), rang it up and noticed it was higher than normal.  It was $1 more than state minimum.  Spending $12.99 is high enough on a 4 pack and then adding $1 to it doesn't help.  I left them on the counter and went to Giant Eagle across the street where the price is correct.  It's hard to support a local beverage store when you have them inflate the price.  I go to some awesome beverages shops in Lakewood and there's 10x more to choose from and the price is the state minimum.  If they continue to do this, they will not make it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Budweiser, this ain't your place. Great selection of craft brews, both to-go and on tap. Wines to suit any taste. Small but effective bar menu, with homemade stromboli. Wine, beer, bourbon or scotch at the bar, and quite possibly the best barstools ever."}
{"text":"I love this place. Cute, intimate, and they have games. Used to be Minotti's. Although they do not have the liquor to sell as Minotti's did, they have a good variety of wine and beer.   Ordered the charcuterie board and was surprisingly pleased with the meat, cheeses and accoutrements.  They have weekly specials too: half price drinks, beer and wine specials, etc.  They also have bourbon to taste if you are in the mood. I do love me some Blantons!  You can order wine by the glass or buy a bottle and drink it there while you play some games.  I plan on going there with a group for happy hour soon."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this shop. The service couldn't be better and the beer and wine selection is diversified without being overwhelming. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Wine Brew and More! A must stop, not only beer and wine but Top shelf Liquors and fantastic top end sandwiches! Parma Press was awesome! I will be back!"}
