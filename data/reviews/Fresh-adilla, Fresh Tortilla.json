{"text":"I go here every weekend. It is simply the best Mexican I have ever had. Two of the nicest people I've met making the best food. Today they had the blue corn tortillas and it was absolutely phenomenal. I recommend everything but my favourite item is the Mushroom Sope with gauc & hot salsa. In a city where truly great Mexican is so hard to find this stands out as good as iv had anywhere, and that includes down south!! Definitely get over there!!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic quesadillas and sopes. If you are looking for real mexican food. This is it!! Great taste and amazing service. I recommend the shredded beef, ground beef and potato with chorizo quesadillas and sopes."}
{"text":"My companion and I both had the chicken quesadilla; Mine with corn and his with flour. We both gobbled them up. They were flavourful, generously filled and very authentic. I look forward to going again and trying other offerings! :-)"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food! Sopes are delicious! Potato, chorizo quesadilla is the best. Great service and everything is homemade. Just fantastic...I think about eating here on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"So so soooo good!!!! I imagine this is what street food tastes like in Mexico. Everything is made fresh, in front of you. I tried two fried quesadillas, one with potato and refried beans. Both were fabulous, but I liked the refried beans better. I'm a very slow eater but these were so good that I devoured them before they could even cool down. And the owners are awfully sweet.   A great quick meal for under $10. Which I followed up with gelato from a nearby vendor :)"}
{"text":"Market on MacLeod, you continue to impress.  On a recent visit to this market, I decided to try out a Mexican kiosk buried in the middle of the market called Fresh-adilla. The menu is small, with 1/3 of the dishes crossed out as unavailable on this visit. I opted for two items: a quesadilla and  a sope.  The sope, which is described as a circle of corn maize with pinched sides comes topped with refried beans sour cream, queso and your choice of meat. The quesadilla comes with melted cheese, sour cream, queso and meat or veg.  After ordering, there was a bit of a wait to receive the food, around ten minutes. However, I did not mind one bit because the reason for the wait is that they make the corn tortillas on demand, pressing the maize mixture in a tortilla press before cooking them on a flattop grill. This made for a delicious soft and thick tortilla that is far superior to the regular kinds you find at the grocery store and other Mexican fast food joints.  In addition to the included toppings, there was a self serve station of a hot salsa verde, a \"very very hot\" red salsa and a guacamole crema.  If you are looking for breakfast or lunch on a Thursday to Sunday, I definitely recommend stopping by this stand for authentic Mexican flavours!"}
{"text":"I really don't like to be bossy as a rule.  BUT...go here!  Excellent prices? Check.  Hand crafted food bursting with flavours?  Check.  Staff that are personable and take pride in their offerings?  Check.  A uniquely satisfying location?  Check.  Yelp brought me here and I wasn't expecting a kiosk style establishment but that did not steal from the 'treasure' this place is.  Mmmmmm, getting hungry just writing this.  Try one of everything (wink). And, get desert and tortillas to take home from the fridge!  {NOTE: Closed Mondays-Wednesdays)"}
{"text":"My Absolute Favorite Mexican Street Food, the Fried corn Quesadilla are amazing, a must try for sure. You get a choice of toppings, my choice is Pulled Chicken and it's served with cheese, sour cream, lettuce. And you can top it off with Hot,Mild,or Very Hot! Other menu items are all great too, and priced very well.  They also serve breakfast, I have not yet tried but everything so far here is well beyond my expectations. Don't forget to try a desert at the end, rice pudding i suggest, and as for a beverage , there are a few authentic Mexican drinks for you as well. My recommendation is the Aqua de Tamarindo(made with tamarind) Enjoy your experience!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Fried corn tortillas were awesome. Took our kids with us and they loved it. (After I scraped the sour cream and lettuce off the quesadilla lol.)"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Love the food and such friendly people. Must eat place for Mexican food. You won't be disappointed.  Make sure you check it out."}
{"text":"Just like Abuelita's kitchen...oh the smells! The Gordon's was amazing, the fried quesadilla's with chorizo - fantastic...and the posole-must be tried! Friendly service, reasonable prices...could rival any CA taqueria!"}
{"text":"Mexican- real Mexican- food has been improving by leaps and bounds in Canada in recent years, and I just had the single best Mexican I've ever had in this country. It's at The Market on Macleod and it's called Fresh-adilla. They make quesadillas and sopes - no tacos, no burritos - with corn tortillas that they make from fresh masa right in front of you. The quesadilla is stuffed with your choice of things; I got potato and chorizo. It's then deep fried, then split open and they add crema, queso fresco and a little shredded lettuce. You can top with salsa of you choice. It is spectacular and unlike any Mex I've ever had and, the owner (from Mexico City) assures me, completely autentico.   Two of these gorgeous things are less than $10 for a very, very good lunch. Amazing."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food I've ever had. I had the Sopes (one chicken and one pulled beef). My husband had the Quesadilla Corn with Potato with Chorizo. Unbelievable!!!!! Can wait to come back"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican Restaurants in town, ... full of flavour with an extensive ( Non Taco ) Menu. The Pozole is not to be missed. I also tried the Gorditas, ...mmm Lovely as well. You see everything prepared in front of you."}
{"text":"They make their tortillas when you order!  They're not the super thin tortillas that I'm used to eating, they were thicker, they were delicious!  I've never eaten food from a Mexican home, but this is what I would imagine it would taste like.   We ordered a gordita, and a quesadilla.  I've never had a gordita before, but to describe it, it's similar to an arepa, but deep fried.  The quesadilla wasn't what I imagined, normally its pan fried or grilled or something, but this one was deep fried.  Both items were deep fried, deep fried anything is delicious as long as it's not greasy.  Fillings were both pretty much the same, we chose pork for both I believe, and was topped with lettuce, tomatoes and queso fresco."}
