{"text":"Tucked into a tiny little space next to BaskinRobins, this place doesn't really stand out that much - just goes to show that one can't judge a book by its cover, because the food is amazing!

I ordered pickup, so my time spent in the store wasn't a lot, but I had a very good first impression.  The interior looked very clean and well maintained.  Far beyond half the the food places I usually go to.  It's cozy, but not too overwhelming like a lot of the coffee shops.  I could see myself spending an hour or more here (maybe I will next time I come). The service was nice, promt, and most importantly, felt very personal.

I had ordered a croissant Tijuana sandwich and their famous Poutine.  Was very impressed with how it looked: usually food doesn't look as good as the advertisement, but this looked better!  See how the cheese stretched? While the Tijuana satisfied me, I'll be looking to try another sandwich next time.  It's still one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten, but it was just a little too well blended for me:  the first bite tasted exactly the same as the last.  Very good as comfort food, but not very...exciting.  

The poutine, though!  Everything the reviews said and more!  I'll admit, I had doubts and deliberated a long time before choosing to order it.  Who wants limp fries instead of crispy ones? Well, the potato skins more than make up for the lack of crispiness. And, the cheese and gravy on top adds much more flavor than mere salt.  Plus, the texture is amazing!  You don't really feel like you're eating fries, really.  I really don't know what else to say to describe how wonderful this dish is. And it looks so very tasty!This Poutine is a \"must order\"...although you might want to order it by itself instead of with a sandwich like me.  The portions are enormous; I think it might last me enough for three whole meals."}
{"text":"What can I say, friendly staff, good authentic food, clean, vegetarian friendly as well. And s kids menu ! Great parking and location .Anything can be customized! Don't be shy just ask"}
{"text":"I have been coming in here since they opened.  The owners, and staff are awesome and friendly.  The good is always fresh and they offer you a free beverage with your meal.  The Munch Box sandwich is my favorite. If you are in a hurry and need your meal to go or have time to sit down you have to check out this place."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for breakfast. Azniv in the front is always super sweet and the food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Best service and food in the area! Love their breakfast menu!!! I love their bagel sandwiches and baklava. If you're in the area, I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes good quality food at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Love the food. Good healthy varieties and some not so healthy also.   Breakfast bagels are really good, lunch options also...wraps and burgers I've tried so far for lunch. Two men working there (brothers/owners?) are really nice and good at recommending options. Would come everyday if I could. Not a lot of seating inside but food is just as good to-go. Always steady stream of people."}
{"text":"I fell upon this place on Yelp and went with my family for breakfast this morning. So happy we decided to go. The food was so good. The family that works there was very sweet. The breakfast sandwiches reminded me of home back East. You also have to try the Baklava pastry...TO DIE FOR!!!. My husband already wants to go back tomorrow for more! Must check it out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food, hometown atmosphere, friendly service as well. A must-go spot when in Henderson!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after reading the reviews...my everything bagel tasted like a plain regular bagel and the onion cream cheese had no onion flavor. My egg was waaay overcooked, brown and crispy with a skin that could be peeled off and the yolks were cooked separate from the egg white - like flat little yellow patties and placed on top of the browned egg whites. How and why were the yolks cooked separately, and if you messed up cooking the egg why serve it like that, make a new one?!? Unfortunately it was an order to go so I didn't see this until at home. Maybe it was an off day for them, I hope so :("}
{"text":"Munch Box is in the former Henderson bakery location, and I'm glad to see the changes they've made to the place. They kept some of the menu items I used to like, but added options and items that take it out of the \"breakfast only\" category and make it a go-to lunch place now, too. There's a great energy in there, and the owners are clearly focused on making sure the customer gets what they want, how they want it.
I've been looking for months for a place with Poutine, and it was excellent. Fries were perfectly browned and fresh cut, with chunks of real (not frozen, breaded/fried) cheese curd generously spread on top, covered in a rich brown gravy that strikes the right balance between savory and salty with onion notes. I have to imagine if you're Canadian this is going to be closer to home than the americanized versions that other places try to replicate. 
I've been here three times for the breakfast bagels since the new owners took over and I've FINALLY found a place that goes out of the way to make the customer happy. See, I like over-easy yolks on my bagel sandwiches. This is the ONLY place in Henderson I've found that will actually do that properly! Einsteins has been advertising their \"fresh cracked eggs\" but it's still just a microwaved (blech) egg. This place grills everything to order and has gotten it perfect each time.
Excellent service and affordable. I'm going to go back next week to try the cheesesteak."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and had great customer. The whole time I was talk with the whole staff having a good time. They also have a secret menu that is spectacular."}
{"text":"Yummie breakfast sandwiches. Tastes like food you make at home. Small place so if it's busy you might have to plan for takeout. Nice to eat somewhere that isn't a chain in Henderson."}
{"text":"t's that place in the neighbor where all the locals go.. The food is exceptional and it won't cost you a arm and a leg. Family own, warn and caring and they'll treat you like one of their own.. 5 star dining on a 2 star budget."}
{"text":"Ordered a veggie wrap, within a few bites I could taste the crunching of egg shell.  They did offer to make me a new on but at this point I was turned off.   Stick to the bagels here"}
{"text":"Many different options options, all great- we had the Southwestern omelette and the Turkey Avocado Grilled Cheese Sandwich- delicious! Staff is friendly and offered to help us decide, answering plenty of questions."}
{"text":"Love this place. The philly cheese steak and loc bagel were out of this world good. And they have the best customer service."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!  GREAT food, service and selection. The owner and staff very friendly and accommodating. The selection is just right not to confuse you. The bagels and delicious along with the egg sandwiches on a croissant."}
{"text":"Definitely go off the tourist areas and check out this place. Friendly service, fresh and healthy food, reasonable price."}
{"text":"It's absolutely the best breakfast and lunch spot in town. Great for an early morning pit stop or for the gourmet lunch on the go!!  Amazing staff and great family run business..."}
{"text":"Great portions and super yummy! Thanks to Azzie for the great service we will be back again!"}
{"text":"Just what we needed in the neighborhood - a breakfast place that doesn't have an hour plus wait!  Delicious, made to order, breakfast sandwiches. Staff are super nice and friendly. I'll definitely become a regular."}
{"text":"Best small place to stop so far !! Breakfast was amazing and the fresh squeezed OJ !! don't miss out"}
{"text":"This is a place worth trying. The breakfast was really good and the philly as well. We stopped by to check it out and will be back again for sure. The people who were working, possibly the owners (?) were very nice and helpful. Hope this place will stick around! Oh and they have real Coca Cola!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast late in the day. Good prices, good coffee, and delicious grilled food."}
{"text":"Cool place. Had chicken cheesesteak and poutine yesterday. A few weeks ago I had a breakfast sandwich. Everything tasted great. Nice folks. Lots of menu options. So glad it showed up in the neighborhood and the horrible bagel shop that was there is gone. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"The Philly sandwich with fries was great.  Crispy fries, huge sandwich.  One of the best ones I've had in town! Glad I found this place! Great customer service"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is wonderful and they serve breakfast all day. The owner and staff are attentive, friendly and service is always quick but the food takes some time as everything is made to order; everything comes out hot and delicious. Try the poutine or my personal favorite the Philly Cheesesteak ... yum!"}
{"text":"Love the locally owned option for breakfast and lunch!  The prices,service, and quality of food are excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!!! Has quickly become my favorite place for lunch. The menu is simple yet unique and is highly customizable. Seriously have to give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Came here again for some Sunday brunch. It just keeps getting better and better every time we come! We had the chicken club and the Denver omelette. The fries that were served with the club are by far the best fries that I've had in town. FRESH, with the perfect amount of crispiness. The omelette had a generous amount of toppings and was delicious. The management/staff is also amazing. Would highly recommend this place. It's perfect for breakfast, lunch, or brunch."}
{"text":"Pricey for the food served. I ordered the ultimate bagel with an over hard egg, Swiss cheese and bacon. My bagel was burnt and had a ring of burnt cheese on it. My friend got the pancakes and couldn't even finish one because they were so sweet. Nice staff but probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great ambience and excellent service. Came here for breakfast before heading to Flagstaff from LAS. Hubby ordered the omelette and wasn't impressed. I ordered French toast and really liked it."}
{"text":"My husband got \"the mountain\" and i got the poutine. Both were amazing! The only issue he had was the paper they used to line the box of food with fell apart and pretty much made the bottom pancake inedible. Otherwise, top drawer."}
{"text":"This is located where Brooklyn Bagel used to be!
The staff was friendly. Food was fairly quick to come out. 
It is slightly expensive ($10) for the ultimate bagel, and the bagel was good. It wasn't the best i've ever had but i would eat it again, just not for that price."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've eaten here, I really liked the food and the service! When I walked in they immediately greeted me ask me how my day was going, I love when a business has great customer service and the employees look like they enjoy their job. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Ordered Uber eats multiple times. Great consistent food and generous portions. Keep in mind never been there in person. Bagel breakfast sandwiches are huge."}
{"text":"Deliciously quick and made to order brunch foods. This spot is a great quick and easy breakfast spot. It's location is also very convenient with Starbucks right next door. 

My boyfriend and I decided to have a quick brunch here on Sunday and were not disappointed. Compared to many other brunch spots on Sundays with a 30-45 minute wait, Munchbox was quick, simple,customizable and fresh."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you get the wonderful smellls. 
This place doesn't hold back on size. The Angus beef is cooked to perfection. The fries are enough for two people. The place is very clean, with a friendy helpful staff to help you choose. I was torn between breakfast and lunch. Went with the BACON BURGER.. Well worth the $8.99....made it a combo with the fries and a drink for $2.49 more.  When it was served, WOW The thing was HUGE! I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a great little find in a stretch of Eastern that has a ton of restaurants. You can tell they put a lot of thought and caring into their meals. The fries are fresh cut, the bread on the sandwiches is great and the value is exceptional. It will be well worth your time to stop in this little gem. I had the Philly Cheesesteak (with no peppers). It was exceptional."}
{"text":"Wow!! Horrible service!!! Disappointed in overall customer service, the Jerk owner was rude and made our experience there uncomfortable. Food was okay, but nothing special. Definitely won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"Not very impressed with their food nor the place. They are kind of fast yes but the food isnt very tasty doesnt make you wanna go back. The poutini fries with the gravy didnt taste good, to much gravy and the gravy doesnt go well with the fries, it would have tasted better just with the bbq sauce and less cheese. Gravy goes with mashed potatoes not fries. The chicken cub sandwich was the most disappointing. Nothing like the picture. Just 2 nuggets put into 3 slices of white bread not even toasted not fried nothing, on the top bread just 1 slice of tomatoes and 1 lettuce thats it. Very tasteless and dry. Not worth what you pay for. Wont be returning."}
{"text":"We eat here regularly for breakfast and lunch. I just tried their BBQ bacon burger. Fantastic !  We also had the power greens salad. Very fresh and tasty with the Robert vinaigrette dressing. 
As always the staff is fantastic and very welcoming. 
Try it !"}
{"text":"This is our second time coming here- my husband and I are aspiring foodies... and when you find something good, you just want to come back! We woke up this morning talking about \"build your own\" breakfast sandwich (they have the same option for lunch)... Cheddar jalapeno bagel with egg, roast beef and sauteed mushrooms and onions. So delish & reasonably priced. Everything is fresh, the owner/staff is friendly. Next on the list is Poutine!"}
{"text":"Super friendly girl in front, ordered a Build your own sandwich. Got the croissant & it was amazing !! Definitely coming here alot more!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have only had the breakfast every time I went there and it is always great.  There turkey bacon is the best. It's a little over priced but worth it.  The staff is always great.  You can eat in or take out.  They just started a rewards program which is good if you go there a lot like I do."}
{"text":"Este cheesesteak philly es la razón por la que vivo, tan delicioso, gran personal y servicio, excelente!"}
{"text":"The most yummiest breakfast food husband and I have had. Delicious!
Everest Pancakes are serious food. Be prepared!"}
{"text":"We ordered the French toast platter and a bagel with cream cheese. The platter comes with eggs, bacon and fruit/home fries. The food was average, if not below average. 

The bagel tasted more like a regular slice of bread than a bagel. Maybe it wasn't toasted enough or something. The rest of the food didn't have much flavor. The bacon was decent but fatty and the French toast had zero flavor. The home fries were the best thing I had and I'm not usually a fan of them. I had a couple bites of everything and left the rest. You get a lot of food for your money but if it's not good, what's the point."}
{"text":"Food was decent.  Customer service was excellent. Friendly staff. Smiling faces.  Kind of pricey for breakfast  food.  And the syrup was cheap quality. I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This place is really good but i wish u guys would stay open later then 3:30 on Fridays and Saturdays ."}
{"text":"You must must must order the strawberry Nutella pancakes. OMG!!!  I do not like pancakes at all but these have changed my mind forever!!  They are pure perfection!!  Thought I'd take a chance and am so glad I did!!!  Wowser!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just plain wow.
I had a sausage egg and cheese with a tomato on a cheddar bagel and I have to say coming from NJ where this sandwich is made almost at every diner, that this sandwich alone was probably one of the most beautiful and delicious things I've ever put in my mouth."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed an early lunch here! Such a wonderful staff too. 

I had the grilled chicken club on sourdough, my wife had a \"create your own bagel sandwich\", and we were both very pleased. 

The French fries were actually great!!!! Usually fries are a standard side, nothing more, but these had fantastic flavor. A must-get.... go figure. 

When in Henderson, we will definitely be dropping back by!!!"}
{"text":"1. Customer service: AMAZING. Everyone is very upbeat and friendly. The lady at the cash register really took her time to suggest and describe menu items which I really appreciated.
2. Vegan friendly options.
3. Big breakfast and lunch menu!!

My boyfriend got a French toast breakfast which he said was delicious. The home fries we were not fond of as the seasoning was very strange and overly salted.
I had the chicken tender club sandwich! I made my own Sriracha mayo which made it even more delicious. The chicken was crispy and juicy which I loved. The fries weren't seasoned with anything and although they were fresh out of the fryer they were very soggy.
Food came out very fast and was nice and hot when they gave it to us. That's always nice. They also have a variety of hot sauces you can use.
Overall I think this is a good place to grab lunch or breakfast. There are still alot of items on the menu that I would love to try!"}
{"text":"The poutine here is amazing.  The fries are fresh cut and the gravy is yummy.  They have an abbreviated but varied menu.  I really like the owners and will be happy to see them succeed."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food. Came here with my husband and two sons. We had the munch box ultimate, munch box breakfast, Tijuana hot, and crispy chicken club. Lots of food and flavor, and for a great price. Everything tasted fresh and the service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"First time here- cute little place with a continuous flow of customers. Interesting menu- your sure to find something to your liking here. Service was good, clean facility, and the food is yummy. I ordered the lox on a croissant and it was delicious. My daughter ordered the strawberry Nutella croissant, and said it was really good! We would come back again when in the area. Definitely worth stopping in for a hearty breakfast!"}
{"text":"The Ft. Apache location is close to my home, and this place is my new favorite place to grab something quick on the go.  It is hard to find a good Bagel and Lox, but they do a great job.  So, I tried the Poutine one day for lunch.  It was amazing! But I recently tried a new sandwich, which is now my all-time favorite.  The turkey avocado grilled cheese on sourdough.  Best sandwich I've had in a very long time.  Plus, everything is quite affordable, and the staff is very friendly.  Definitely check this place out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Came here after church and the food and service was awesome. Had a chicken club with was delicious but you absolutely have to get the poutene (spelling bad) fries. I'm definitely going back to this place."}
{"text":"In short: Come for the awesome poutine, stay for the well-priced sandwiches. 

The poutine is served just like it should be: hot skin-on fries with tons of cheese curd nuggets and a gravy bath. You can add pork to make it meaty and the portion is huge for sharing.
 
As for sandwiches, the Lox Bagel is under $8 and comparable to pricier versions across the Vegas valley. Pick your bagel (Everything!), and I recommend adding extra onion for crunch.

Bonus points for friendly service and a Yelp check-in offer for a free drink. Tijuana Hot, I'll see you next time!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a great meal.
Try the Philly Cheesesteak, or the Poutine Fries.
How about amazing French Toast for dessert?
They have it all, great sandwiches, bagels, breakfast specials, and it's all just yummy as can be. Friendly staff, good atmosphere, this is a really nice place. We will be back"}
{"text":"You have to try to the Philly Cheesesteak! It is amazinnnggg!! Stopped by after showing some houses and I needed some food, was not disappointed at all. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I haven't ordering anything off the menu yet I haven't loved. Have ate there every Sunday / Saturday the last 2 months"}
{"text":"Great food. Above all else, I love how their dirty minds got away with naming their business Munch Box. They can go eat their heart out over at Pho Kim Long."}
{"text":"Every day I'd see people looking in the windows waiting for this joint to open. I was one of them! Finally open and I had to try the Everest pancakes. Delicious. Menu is very interesting and I will eat my way through it. Everything is made to order. Next up will be the poutine burger with Mom's famous fries."}
{"text":"Some really good ass food. The Vegan Burger is the bomb ! Nice people, food taste home made but kinda even better."}
{"text":"We went here for a Mothers day brunch and I have to say it was delicious.  I had the poutine burger, which was delicious but a TON of food. I think I'd ask for it with no bun next time, since I didn't eat any of the bun anyway.  We had a range of different items, but everyone really liked theirs.  I agree with other reviewers I think I'll try a build your own breakfast sandwich next time I go.

The staff was very friendly and the owner even came out and talked to us for a bit, she was very nice!

I would definitely go back, and already plan to!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Saturday morning and it was popping! It's colorful, fun, and the up beat. The employees were all doing something the whole time and they all had smiles on their face and were super friendly. We ordered a couple bagel sandwiches and my daughter had the kids pancakes (they were HUGE). Everything was delicious! The jalapeño cream cheese? Oh lord, I want to rub it all over myself. So good. We were glad we stumbled upon this little gem. We will definitely be back now that we know about it."}
{"text":"I got the munch box Everest Pancakes. They were amazing and will fill you up no matter what hunger you have. The owner works the cash register and is really nice. She and the other workers will come and check on you. Great place and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Bomb breakfast sandwiches. Ordered take out 3 times since moving to the area a month ago and dined in today. Good value for what you get. I've mostly had their BYO breakfast sandwiches and have switched it up every time and they've all been good. Everything has always been fresh and delicious, you can definitely tell that they have their bagel game on point! Can't wait to try some of their burgers and salads soon as I know I'll be back a lot! Also, the guy who helped us today was super nice and seemed like he genuinely cared about our dining experience. I always appreciate warm, welcoming hospitality especially on a Sunday morning. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Munch Box is truly a Hole in the Wall Restaurant in the northwest corner of the Smith's Shopping Center on Eastern. It is easy to miss even if you know that it is in that shopping center because of the odd location. But if you are looking for a quality, inexpensive quick lunch this is certainly a place to go. Their signature dish is the poutine. This is a dish made of french fries, beef gravy and cheese curds. We added pork tenderloin for another three and a half dollars. Definitely a worthwhile addition. It is a huge portion so unless you are really hungry , come with someone to share the dish with. I also ordered the turkey avocado grilled cheese sandwich. Also absolutely delicious. This is a great choice for a non-chain restaurant for a quick delicious inexpensive lunch."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this spot when I saw it on yelp. Burgers, sandwiches, breakfast foods, and poutines. I've had a lot of poutines in Canada so I was excited for some in Vegas. 

Upon walking in, the restaurant seemed pretty clean and modern. We looked at the menu for awhile because there was a lot to take in. The cashier seemed impatient, which was sort of awkward. We got the poutine burger with a poutine side & the Philly cheesesteak with home fries to go. As we waited I noticed there was a neat sauce bar area along with to go boxes conveniently placed. 

The food itself was pretty good! I enjoyed the Philly cheesesteak (could use more crisp on the buns) and loved the home fries. The poutine burger was also very, very good. The poutine itself was completely drenched in gravy, which made the fries too soft. The cheese that was used in it was really good tho. 


Overall, the food was good and there was a nice environment. I wouldn't mind coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Large portions and fresh food. Loved it, new favorite breakfast place by far!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came for breakfast. The Tijuana hot sandwich was fantastic. We both had egg whites with Turkey bacon and it was cooked to perfection. I would definitely recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"You know those hole-in-the-wall, family-owned places where the product and customer service are excellent? You love the experience so much you keep coming back? This is one of those places. I debated whether or not to rave about Munch Box on Yelp to keep it \"my little secret\" - so silly and dumb! Anyway, check it out."}
{"text":"Stopped in because of the great reviews and left disappointed. The chicken is the wrap wasn't properly seasoned, the wrap wouldn't hold together and was falling apart. I'm not a fan of hot avocado tomato or mushrooms in my sandwich wrap. Lots of people in there.. maybe the breakfast is what we should have ordered."}
{"text":"Really cool little spot. When I lived in NY, there used to be a little bagel spot that sold bagels, sandwiches and 3 non-pretentious breakfast dishes. This is a more modern, Anthem version of that kind of place.

The girl who usually works the front counter is very friendly and will help navigate you through the small menu.  The menu is pretty straight forward. A few sandwiches, pancakes, French toast and some ways to modify those few things. 

First time here I got the breakfast sandwich that has the hash browns on the inside. I enjoyed it but the bagel and hash browns was way to much starch. If you get that go with a sliced bread instead of bagel. Also have had the avocado turkey grilled 
cheese which was AWESOME! 

This time around I went with a build your own breakfast sandwich with fried egg, bacon, pepper jack cheese on rye. While my wife got the strawberry Nutella pancakes (without the Nutella *shrugs in confusion*).

My sandwich was delicious. I got it as a combo with fries since last time I tried the hash browns and home fries. 

My wife's pancakes were good too. Had the right bite a pancake should have while still feeling fluffy. Had a lot of vanilla in the batter which came through. 

One thing I'm not stoked on is it's a little pricey for what it is. To be fair the portions are massive. Which is why I don't count it against them, but I'd rather have the 2 massive pancakes I can finish and pay a little less. I'm the oldest of four boys and I can put down some food. Both times I came here I couldn't finish my plate. 

Overall a really good place my wife and I stop at when we are in the area. Grilled cheese turkey avocado is the best thing I've had there."}
{"text":"Got the Tijuana hot sandwich with added tomato and a Philly cheesesteak with fries and a drink. Both were great, philly was huge and the egg sandwich was average"}
{"text":"This place is going to have my colleague and I coming here everyday because for 1) its right near my job, 2) fast service, and convenience of ordering ahead online 3) its soo yummy  i have been looking for a place that sells breakfast bagel sandwiches all day how i used to get it back home in NY and this place is it... So yummy the Tiajuanna bagel sandwich has a spicy cream cheese w egg n bacon n ur choice of cheese and bread, w fries and its so delicious... dip it in tapatio hot sauce and your in heaven ... two thumbs up, great service"}
{"text":"Awesome place great food friendy and delish. Try it out!! All the way around this place is worth the visit."}
{"text":"We love this place everything is always cooked to order and fresh. Service is amazing! Gotta try the Tijuana Hot"}
{"text":"When my husband and I came in we found Munchbox to be clean with great background music playing. The customer service is great and the food was delicious! The serving is enough to be ing food home. Definitely come to Munchbox, you'll enjoy your time here."}
{"text":"First of all its BREAKFAST ALL DAY! How can you lose?! They also have lots of brunch options. They have a build your own lunch which is nice if you want to be specific. 

My hubby got a Philly cheese steak sandwich which was good, the pepper and onion pieces weren't too big so they weren't too overwhelming. It didn't have too much cheese which was a bummer cause I love me some cheese but im sure you can ask for extra. The fries were the perfect amount of crisp.

I got a salad for lunch and man I will say they did not cheap out in the avocado. They gave me enough for the whole salad which I will say was HUGE. I had to put half my salad in another container so I can mix it properly  which I think is a great problem to have  

 What i was mostly impressed with was the hot sauce bar, mainly because they HAVE one. Most places only have Tabasco but they have all the good stuff and more. The entire restaurant including the bathroom was very clean. Needless to say ill be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to stop by for my lunch break since it's right in that plaza. The food is amazing, great atmosphere, employees are super friendly and are always so good to us when we head over! 
I recommend MunchBox to everybody (I recommend to my UPS customers when they say they are hungry ) and they always come back thanking me for sending them that way! 
The turkey avocado grilled cheese, Strawberry Nutella pancakes and the chicken club with fries are my favorite and they have a lot more tasty menu items! Breakfast and Lunch all day!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and Wonderful service!!! The owner is such a sweet woman And so kind And she is very genuine and cares about her customers. This is a awesome place to get some of the best sandwiches in Las Vegas !!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!! VERY VERY VERY GOOD FOOD !! A+++"}
{"text":"Meh, not very impressed. Food was quite flavorless. Service was disorganized. Eating area was cramped. Nothing was there worth coming back a second time"}
{"text":"A family friend took me to Munch Box for lunch. Truth be told, I didn't know what to expect. This amazing little slice of heaven is in a strip mall and can't easily be seen from the street. We arrived about 12:30ish and the place was kind of quiet. The menu is on 4 tv monitors mounted on the wall and it is quite extensive. They have everything from pancakes to cheese steak sandwiches. My eyes zeroed in on the Munch Box Poutine Burger. 

So imagine this. A beef patty, topped grilled onion, fried egg, bacon, cheese, french fries, and poutine gravy. Then topped with a brioche bun. As you can imagine, you can't pick it up to eat it. As a side, I had french fries.

The staff is very friendly. Munch Box is a family run operation from what I understand and the family is French Canadian. So it is great to get poutine from people who know what they are doing. Pricing is VERY reasonable. Parking is ample. Munch Box shares the parking lot with Smith's and Winchell's(The bar, not the doughnut shop.) 

Munch Box is another great culinary gem in the evolving food scene in Henderson. So get off the Strip and give it a try."}
{"text":"Pretty good cheese steak - a good size and a ton of fries, and good bread.  Got double cheese on mine and I think that was the right thing to do.  They have Pepsi products (I'm more of a Coke fan).  Looking forward to going back and trying the various poutine offerings as well as breakfast sometime."}
{"text":"I ordered a turkey avocado grilled cheese with fries for $10.81 (including tax). There is nothing special about this sandwich. You might as well go over to Smith's and buy bread, turkey, avocado, and pepper jack and make it yourself. 
The avocado was not cut well so it was just a big clump in the sandwich. And the fries were incredibly greasy, soggy, and not even salted. 
The only reason this isn't a one star is because the staff there is very friendly and helpful. Overall, the food isn't that great for the price you're paying but the service is good."}
{"text":"This was good, I had the simple breakfast. It consisted of two eggs and hash brown and toast on the side. I had a craving for breakfast and this was close by. It wasn't horrible but it also wasn't amazing....But to be fair, I also didn't have anything special so maybe it's worth a try if your are near by and want to try a new place. The place is cute and the kitchen is right behind the counter so everything freshly cooked."}
{"text":"The Chicken Avocado Wrap is my favorite!  Delicious and fresh. Very friendly service as well! I will be sure to frequent this place for my breakfasts and lunches!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast spot in town. I'm addicted. It's style is a bagel/sandwich shop that can compete with some of the best in Brooklyn, NY. The hash browns are on the sandwich and that makes all the difference in the world. The owners are always there. The employees are always friendly. If you check in they'll give you a cup of good, dark coffee on them. That's just the icing on the cake, as their breakfast sandwiches are that much better then the next best place. I hope they expand and bring this quality to other areas of the valley, as they deserve the success."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite. Near our home which makes it convenient. Large menu. Friendly."}
{"text":"Food is good but on the greasy side. Price wise it was not bad at all. The staff was nice and friendly and was checking on us making sure all was good. Service is quick. The area is kinda busy so parking is a little bit tight, but other than that all is well"}
{"text":"It's noon and I'm sitting here eating breakfast, I thought i have to wait too long to get my order but it was ready in couple minutes, nice place, clean, good customer service, happy faces and the most important delicious food. Will eat here every time I'm in Henderson."}
{"text":"The turkey avocado pepper jack sandwich on a croissant was amazing! The staff was great and nice. They offered complimentary drinks for dining in!"}
{"text":"Came here at 10am, starving, and ordered the Tijuana Hot sandwich. I didn't receive it until 1045am. They weren't that busy, but they only have one cook. There was a woman who waited about as long as we did for a to-go order. The food was good though. They definitely need to hire more people for these \"busy\" Saturdays. Also the grammar on their menu is horrendous. I also increased the review one star because the employee was very apologetic and gracious, but the owner needs to step up his game."}
{"text":"Woke up and wanted to try something new. WoW!! I'm so excited I found Munch Box!! The food was fresh, hot, and terrific. The employees were so nice and welcoming. 

Oh and the pontine was out of this world. Stop by you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This spot right here is good to go with me. Ordered the turkey avacdo grilled cheese sandwhich and man that was good..Two thumbs up guy when I am n vegas i will be stopping by"}
{"text":"This place was so cute! Stopped in for breakfast one morning with the family and everyone enjoyed it. My son got the kids French toast which was a good portion and he loved it. I got a delicious Denver omelette and some fresh fruit. Hubby got pancakes that were ginormous and came with a tower of sausage and potatoes. We all want to come back and try the different breakfast sandwiches they have."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood eatery.
Everything was prepared fresh and came up quickly. 
Finally some good poutine in Vegas! 
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Staff was friendly and attentive. Fabulous breakfast. Only minor complaint is the OJ was $3.49 for a small glass (it was excellent though). We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered poutine togo...extra crisp fries. They told me 20 minutes. I can tell my order was sitting for a while. It was cold, soggy and not fresh at all. No flavor in the gravy either. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"First time at this place, we drive by it all the time and we were pleasantly surprised. We both got build your own croissant sandwiches and we're surprised at the portion size (huge sandwich) for the price ($6). Pretty big menu considering the size of the restaurant. 
Will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and i have been reluctant to try this place. Not only did I pay 38.00 (plus tip) for 3 sandwiches and a order of onion rings. 
I received 3 large ring and two half broken ones,I'm the order. During the ordering process I  SPECIFICALLY told the cashier place certain ingredients in and not toast my bread. 
( not rocket science) she did offer an extra beverage and a bag of chips. I realize now she must of known  I'd be disappointed with this meal.  So unfortunate. We eat out 4 times a week...just for dinner, so we won't be returning . I called to let her know how disappointed I was to NOT have what I ordered and paid for, she was RUDE and dismissive. Be aware , There only looking for a buck, and there bathrooms are dirty."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly. Food was prepared quickly. Restaurant & restrooms were clean. I had an omelette & it was tasty. It was affordable & tasty. I'd return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. Quick, hearty, I never leave hungry! Great prices, clean, very friendly. I recommend this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Tried the Newport Omelette (egg white, spinach, mushroom with swiss cheese )super delicious! They have quite a menu and they serve breakfast and lunch all day, plenty of vegetarian options.
I would also recommend their Southwestern omelette which has roasted red pepper, hashbrown and swiss cheese. This order comes with toast and any side (I ordered fruit).
Portions are decent I'll definitely be back, their customer service is impeccable!!!"}
{"text":"Really cool place.  You can create your own breakfast or lunch sandwich.  Very tasty croissant egg bacon and cheddar cheese sandwich.   Can't wait to come back for lunch.  Pancakes are good too.  One bad thing about this place is.....they need more seats.  Constant flow on people coming in.  Oh and the freshed squeezed orange juice is the best."}
{"text":"Super cute little place. Food was absolutely delicious! If I lived here I would be frequent flyer! Staff was friendly and really welcoming. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent. 

The service very friendly and nice. She walked us through orders and side. Recommended what goes with what and it was amazing. 

I had the  Tijuana Hot on the jalapeño bagel. The cream spread was excellent and the cheese was perfect. Added bacon for some crunch. All in all I was very satisfied. 

Wifey had the Munch Box Ultimate. She thought it was delicious and not to heavy. Not messy. Not greasy from too much cheese. 

This place is brand new and if they keep this up they will be very popular. 

We enjoyed our lunch. Thanks"}
{"text":"The owners here and the management at this restaurant are the best! Every time I order it's always delicious and satisfying for lunch! Their Philly cheese steak is one of my favorites - fresh and flavorful. Thank you munch box!"}
{"text":"I was having my watch serviced next door and decided to stop here while I was waiting. This is a no-frills breakfast place with friendly service. Order at the register, take your number and they bring you your food. A tiny bluetooth speaker in the corner of the joint softly plays some background tunes. I tried a sausage breakfast bagel sandwich; they ask how you want your eggs prepared which is cool. The sausage patty was  indistinguishable from a fast food sausage patty. I upgraded to a combo for $2.49 or so which comes with a side and a coffee or soft drink. The hash brown side is basically a McDonald's hash brown patty, not like griddle hash browns. In full transparency, I was informed (warned?) about this at the register. They also have home fries which I'll have to try next time (I love potatoes if you can't tell!). The self-service coffee was average. There are certainly higher quality breakfast places within minutes of here, but this is a decent quick bite for around 10 bucks.

TL;DR: Average food, friendly staff. Good for a quick, inexpensive bite. Check in on yelp when you walk in for a free drink."}
{"text":"Awesome!
My husband wanted to check this place out because of their poutine so we decided to drop by the other week to try it. The staff was so friendly and the lady who was the cashier was really helpful when I was deciding on what I wanted to order. We each got our own bagel sandwiches and shared an order of poutine. The portions are so big that we were already full half way in. I recommend checking this place out and when you do, expect to ask for a to go box."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious poutine. The Newport omelette was packed with Swiss cheese just the way I like it. Denver omelette outstanding. FAST and friendly service. So glad I live close by."}
{"text":"Walked in and it smellllled sooo good ! We came at 9am after a work meeting and  found this place nearby, it wasn't busy for a Friday morning! The service and the employees were super friendly ! Check in on yelp for free coffeee"}
{"text":"El hot Tijuana sandwich esta muy bueno, los precios nada mal mucho mejor que comer en algún lugar de comida rapida. El único pero es que el menu esta en la pared arriba de las mesas y es un poco incomodo que toda la gente que entra te este viendo comer."}
{"text":"Henderson needed a spot like this. Great breakfast and lunch. Suuuuper friendly people. Fantastic breakfast sandwiches and great burgers. Try the poutine. Healthy options as well"}
{"text":"Super nice staff and their food is amazing. The bagel and lox is my favorite so far, but had their avocado chicken wrap today and it was delicious. I will be back many more times :)"}
{"text":"Bomb bomb bomb bomb. This place is so gooooood. I had the Tijuana bagel with cheddar. So bomb! I also love their fresh orange juice. Excellent service and sometimes I wait for my food but it's definitely worth it. Definitely give this place a try, you definitely won't regret it"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place. I ordered on Postmates and the food was gross. Not a place I'll order from or visit again."}
{"text":"The strawberry Nutella pancakes are so yummy! This place is super close to my apartment which makes it even better!"}
{"text":"Grandma and I went out on a farmers market afternoon and found this place! Munchbox has great customer service. I checked in and got a free coffee for grandma via facebook. We ordered the philly and bagel and lox. The food was excellent and the outdoor patio at the time was really cool and nice and bright outside. We had a good time just relaxing and eating lunch together. Come by I am sure there is something on the menu for you!"}
{"text":"Another trip to Vegas, another breakfast at Munchbox. Ultimate breakfast bagel sandwich is legit."}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant. I had the breakfast which was very good . French toast was good. My husband had the Philly cheese steak which had great flavor and the fries with gravy awesome. I would recommend the cheese steak and the fries with the gravy. We will be back to try something else. Thank you for the wonderful service!"}
{"text":"When I first came here I had some definite suspicions; I mean how they could they get such a great rating in such a short amount of time? Well, now I know. 

The \"Munch Box\" which sounds like a restaurant in the Tarantino movie universe took over the space that used to be owned by probably the worst deli/cafe that I've ever patronized. Not much has changed in the style department here, but the menu is a complete overhaul. It's all the bagel sandwich staples, lox, and capers, a variety of egg sandwiches, along with salads, deli sammies, and a full omelet menu. I've been here twice now and both times the food has been fantastic and made quick. The one downside is there no iced coffee offered, only hot coffee. Bummer! 

I tried the Tijuana breakfast sandwich, the three cheese egg sandwich, and the Poutine. The Tijuana is the one to get and comes stacked with three egg whites, jalapeno cream cheese, and whatever protein or bagel you want. I went with sausage and a jalapeno cheese bagel, which was super messy, but totally worth the seven napkins that were used to clean my face. This wasn't too spicy and was very filling. 

The surprise here is how good the Poutine tasted. No frills or crazy add-ons, just basic French fries, cheese curds, and brown gravy on top. This is a huge portion of food and could easily be shared with an another box muncher. 

This box is totally worth a munch. Come by and sink your teeth in. 

PRO TIP: Check-in for a free coffee or soda!"}
{"text":"Never been to this place until today and have to say that it is a really good and would come back now on."}
{"text":"Quick breakfast here. Food was great and the service excellent. Not very fancy but a good stop when younare on the go and need good food in a hurry."}
{"text":"Great find in Henderson, AZ.  We like eating at non chain places.  This is a great place.  You will not walk away hungry.   The food is good, amazing portions, and clever menu items.   You order at the counter and find a seat.  The staff is very friendly.  The staff came out to our table and asked how everything was.   You can tell that they care about their place."}
{"text":"I so  love this place and this family!!! I wish you were in Sherman Oaks Ca. I would be eating there all the time. It is for sure my go to place now when in Vegas"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with the lady and the little one. I had the Tijuana with egg whites and turkey sausage, the lady had the ultimate breakfast sandwich with bacon and we ordered the French toast for the little one. The food was fresh and simply amazing. The biggest thing that stood out during our first visit was the service, we were beyond impressed. She was very attentive and accommodating, made our visit very welcoming."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast find.  Lots of choices, good for the budget and wonderful customer service."}
{"text":"Everything I've ordered has been amazing. The strawberry Nutella pancakes are to die for and the traditional lox sandwich are my go-to's. I love the ease ordering a good breakfast right before work! The staff is super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Went their for lunch with coworkers yesterday and was not disappointed. Food was filling, and flavorful and they are so accommodating! A coworker asked for a chicken Philly cheese steak that they don't even serve and they went ahead and made her one. I didn't give them 5 stars because their chairs are uncomfortable and it sucks trying to enjoy awesome food in an uncomfortable position. Will definitely be going back, but maybe taking the food to go.."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in town. 
Great family own business 
A must if you leave in the Henderson area. 

Buon Appetito"}
{"text":"Way over priced! I payed $18 for a bagel potatoes n orange juice! The food was good but $18 for breakfast? Gtfoh"}
{"text":"Ordered lox bagel and Cream cheese. Lox had a generous amount . Ins ordered pancakes with hash browns n eggs. My friend ordered the French toast . Everyone was happy and satisfied with there food ! Good place for breakfast or brunch . Shopping center of Smith's off eastern !"}
{"text":"Overall an amazing place to eat, I've been coming in here for about 2 years now and it's literally one of my best places to eat for breakfast and lunch. Family friendly and the staff are really kind people. If it's the first time you go there you have to taste either Philly Cheesesteak (my personal favorite) or the Munch Box Ultimate which are both equally amazing !!  You have to try this place out , you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Was SO happy to see that Munch Box now carries VitaNourish wat you can enjoy the taste and nutritional value of  VitaNourish as you grub down at both Munch Box locations .  Great food and Great water always a winning combo !!!!"}
{"text":"Neat little place that you can get in and of in a hurry if you want food a notch above conventional fast food in the area. The staff was polite and friendly, I got the Denver omelette and a coffee. The coffee is standard truck driver brew (strong&dark) and the omelette was pretty standard however I wish they would cook down the peppers and onions a little that way you don't get that raw bite when your munching down. Def will be back when not on a carb restricting day to try the bagels. They looked and smelled great!"}
{"text":"I got the breakfast bagel and boy was it fresh and delicious. It is one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had ever. It was so good I came here on Saturday morning and Sunday morning. What was amazing was that there was a very friendly cashier on Sunday he even help our group with a small project we had. He honestly has great customer service and is a very friendly person he definitely deserves a raise I forgot his name because it has been so long but he was wearing a dress light colored shirt and has a very friendly smile! Thank you again my good friend and hopefully I will see you again when I return to Nevada!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Ordered with a few special requests/notes (whole wheat bagel, items on side, etc.) and they delivered exactly what we asked for."}
{"text":"My \"to go order\" breakfast sandwich with egg, bacon, cheese on a bagel was piping hot when I got it home. The problem with this was everything turned to mush. The cook needs to let the sandwich cool somewhat before they wrap it in aluminum foil. Total disaster!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, the measure of an excellent business operator is someone who would open a locked business, greet by name, insist on serving even though he's the only employee here and just cleaned up, and refused gratuity. 

Come to this place. Now!"}
{"text":"I was visiting the neighboring coffee shop when I decided to pop in this eatery with the provocative name. Owned and operated by this tiny spitfire of a host, Azniv, and her Armenian brothers, creating a family style shop that's big on service and flavor. I ordered the lox and sesame bagel, asked for it open-faced and it came out perfectly toasted and delicious! There's always a line, so that has to say something, if anything that was a good sign to me and it moves quickly. It's in the corner of the Smith's shopping center on Eastern and Horizon Ridge Parkway, sandwiched between Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf and Subway, right next to BR 31 Flavors. For a quick, reasonably priced breakfast or lunch, drop in here; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new place in our area so we looked up this place. It a small eat in breakfast and lunch place. I had the French toast with home fries, eggs and bacon my husband did the simple breakfast,, eggs over easy (which were hard on bottom) home fries bacon and toast. The food was good I only have two complaints one was the toast came out not buttered  and it is time consuming for him to butter it and they only have half/half for coffee no milk. That needs to be addresses as not everyone including me do not like half/half...."}
{"text":"I always pass this place because of Starbucks and always wondered what they had. Omg. I'm so glad I took the time to try this place. The Philly cheesesteak was sooo good. Along with the poutine fries !! Definitely a must. And it's also a great price !! Can't wait to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"It would seem that the owner feels overworked and in need of a day off. Doesn't get an A+ for serving food with a smile."}
{"text":"Pretty solid lunch place.  It recently opened but still had a small line on a weekday at noon which is nice to see.  They specialize in bagels, and they are tasty.  A little thinner than the New York style you're used to, but have a nice sweetness.  Very good and perfect for sandwiches. My lox sandwich and side of fruit hit the spot.  Not the largest, but for under $10 I think that's fine with quality smoked salmon and freshly cooked bagels. Munch Box, as it specializes in breakfast/lunch, has some good deals for building your own sandwich for $8 or adding a drink and side for under $3.  As a lunch spot, the variety was good and service was super fast.  They also have a very good system of ordering online to easily get your meal to go.  Munch Box is a good addition to the area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Consistency is key and everything on the menu is awesome. You can't go wrong with anything you order!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with kind hearted ppl!!!  The staff was so nice to me and my baby boy I had to share with las Vegas and yelpers  so they can hopefully come and experience the great hospitality!!"}
{"text":"I swear i go so many times in a week, everything i get is bomb and fresh. The staff is super nice and friendly. I try not to go every day. I always go with coworkers or my boyfriend and they all love it."}
{"text":"The other week I was looking to have a sandwich for lunch. And although there are lots to choose from, I wanted a non-franchise sandwich shop to go to. Unfortunately, the first time around, I couldn't find Munch Box. However, as I had to stop at CVS, I saw Munch Box in the shopping plaza across the street. Lucky I found it so that I could try it today.

Parking spaces immediately in front of the restaurant is for 20-minutes only. However, parking for an early lunch isn't too bad.  As I parked and made my way to Munch Box, I had to walk past Subway. Weird that they're next door to each other.

They have many good options, but I decided on the chicken club for today. As a few other patrons followed, they ordered breakfast.

While waiting for my meal, I went to the restroom. Although the restaurant seems to be clean, the restroom felt filthy. Unfortunately, that somewhat ruins it for me because it makes me wonder about the rest of the restaurant, the stuff we don't see.

It has been a while since I've had my favorite sandwich. So the top portion of Chicken Club sandwich had a slightly overcooked thin chicken breast with bacon, a slice of toasted bread and the lettuce and tomato on the bottom.  All in all, it was just okay.

Although I ordered first, the other table got their breakfast first, it's just easier to make. And of course, they finished before I did.  The waitress asked the young man how he liked his meal, and he said, \"it was soooo good.\" And rubbed his tummy to indicate he was full.

While he and his buddy were leaving, a few high schoolers, with Justin Beiber haircuts walked by. One of them saying, \"this place is FIRE!\" So i'm assuming that he meant it was hot, like super good kind of hot.

All-in-all I'll have to give this visit 3-stars for an ok sandwich, ok ambience, filthy restroom, nice employees."}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff is awesome. The food is outrageously delicious, portion are so big you can share very fresh ingredients. I will recommend this place for breakfast and lunch go hungry you will be satisfy"}
{"text":"I would say there are a lot of fake reviews of this place. Be warned .  There is no atmosphere and the food is average to below average imo."}
{"text":"POUTINE!!! Real Poutine. Thank you for doing it right. The breakfast sandwiches were also amazing, and we loved the fact you can customize it to your liking. Great location with plenty of parking and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Everything was good! The food was delicious & the service was good! I got \"The Veggie Wrap\" but instead of the wrap I got it in a croissant & it was delicious! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Munch box is great! Shouldn't have waited so long to come in here. My Wife had the avocado grilled cheese with a green salad. I had the BLT with fries. Both meals were delicious! Coke products are also a plus in my book. Restaurant is very clean. Azzie at the register is a peach. She also checks up on you if you choose to eat inside. Background music (80's pop) is at just the right volume."}
{"text":"This was a cute little place. I enjoyed the build your own option. I built a breakfast sandwich with a croissant, added bacon, fried egg, tomatoes and lettuce. Their coffee is refillable and their staff is friendly. I would definitely recommend visiting here for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Always love stopping at the Munch Box to pick up a bagel or two. Staff are friendly and the food is always good. It's a simple place with a simple set up of breakfast all day. Bagels, sandwiches, wraps - nothing fancy or out of the ordinary, but really good and prepared fresh in front of you. 

For all the praise I give the food and friendly staff, the place itself is not up to standard. The floor almost always seems dirty because of the very poor tile work, and seating is not very welcoming. They also could improve the lighting in their establishment - it's just not \"light\" enough in there and a change in light bulbs would achieve that. All in all the place is run down hence making it an ideal order to go spot."}
{"text":"WOW! I am excited! Usually I don't find the \"Perfect Place\" till I have lived somewhere for years! I found Munch Box in the first few weeks of living in Anthem. The Perfect Menu.
If you have dietary restrictions, or just don't want certain things on your sandwich, this place is the answer! You choose your , bread, cheese, toppings...etc. OH!!! And Poutine!!!OMG!
Also, Mom's Famous Fries....I was told the secret,,,they peel them first before they fry them.
they are not afraid to go the extra step to give quality food! Thanks to Savannah for welcoming me and being such a great customer service rep for the company...So Sweet, and the pride that James takes is evident in every dish he delivers...Amazing , Skilled , and well trained...I'd say he's ready for Next Food Network Star!....Don't Pass this Place up,,,but please, save me a table!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome small business to go for breakfast and Lunch! Great service with friendly staff! I had been here several times and always had a fantastic experience with a happy tummy!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place a well with my husband and every time we come it's a warm and cozy atmosphere. All the staff are so friendly and the food is amazing! This is my go to place for breakfast and lunch the Poutine Fries are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I live on this side of town and have been wanting to go into this diner for awhile now. Upon arriving I was greeted so warmly by the counter girl. She knew the menu up and down and helped my party order their food. The place was cute and clean, customer service was even better!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and good poutine! The poutine is what brought me here,  my kids loved that the pancakes came with icecream,  and hubby said the chicken strips were good.  Nice stop for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Found out about this gem through Uber Eats. Everything bagel was the absolute best I've come across in the Vegas area since moving here last December from New York.

The chicken club was also exceptionally good, reminded me a lot of sandwiches i use to get from a local Delicatessen. Flavor and balance of ingredients was absolutely perfect.

 I will definitely be ordering from here frequently."}
{"text":"Good food nice people good pricing. Got a Bagel-soft and fresh. Breakfast sandwiches look great."}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood breakfast spot! It's cozy and comforting! The staff is amazing and so welcoming, we love visiting them!

But honestly the food is Amazing!! We usually get a veggie wrap on a croissant and add philly steak meat to it! 

The French fries remind me of the kind my mom used to make for me. 

Next time I'm going to try a Philly cheesesteak because it looked so good.

Support your locals and small businesses. Especially this cute family owned and operated breakfast and lunch joint."}
{"text":"Best Philly Cheese Steak in the Nation guaranteed!!! Came here for the first time and I was astonished by the great customer service and food. If you want an awesome friendly experience come here!!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving breakfast and the owner was kind enough to make me this amazing cheese steak egg white omelette with veggies. Omg it was amazing! I love this place and now I'm a regular. You also have to try the Philly cheesesteak too... If you know what a cheesesteak is really supposed to taste like then you will truly appreciate it. Not to mention the service is superb!"}
{"text":"Cozy little breakfast/lunch spot.   Prices are good,  and everything we ate was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Always great service with a great smile and amazing food. My favorite is The Munch Box Ultimate! They let you select tour bagel, meat, cheese, and egg to make the perfect concoction for your tastebuds' needs.

Music inside the restaurant is always nice. Stop on by and give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I saw good reviews but was VERY disappointed in what I was served. I ordered the chicken club to go.

This hands down has to be the driest sandwich I've ever eaten. It had absolutely no condiments and as an added bonus the chicken was so dry hard and rubbery that my teeth could barely rip it apart. My dog didn't even want to eat and she eats everything. 

Never coming here again.... How can you be satisfied with serving that to a paying customer? You felt how dry and hard the chicken was when you made the sandwich."}
{"text":"Great place , new owners are extremely friendly. Food is great. I had the avocado grilled cheese and I was very satisfied. They have redone the entire inside with a contemporary style. I will defiantly start eating here more."}
{"text":"Great location!! Excellent customer service, clean, complimentary coffee M-F, food was delicious and fresh, reasonable prices. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Five starts for this little gem! I love brunch places cause it always gives you options on what to eat if you are too hungry to decide. At this place.. they have plenty of options!

I ordered the veggie burger munch box with fruits. The veggie burger itself was very flavorful, it was a black bean patty with quinoa. It came with lettuce, tomato, avocado, and hummus to add more flavor. The burger itself was huge and didn't end up finishing the entire thing.

My boyfriend got the Denver omelette with hash brown & toast. The omelette was good and wasn't oily compared to some diners. 

Staff is very friendly and accommodating to their customers even though it's not a sit down restaurant. 

Next time I will be back for breakfast and make my own breakfast sandwich!"}
{"text":"We are out traveling for bowling and found this little gem that services breakfast and lunch all day. Ordered the 2 egg breakfast with home fries with bacon on the side.  My husband ordered the munch box.  The food was great the service was good. Would go back again!"}
{"text":"First time trying this local spot and was totally impressed!! The poutine burger was amazing! Beyond delicious! I've never eating a burger with a fork and knife until this morning! Excellent service and portion was enormous! Can't wait to go back and try other selections on the menu!"}
{"text":"I frequent the Starbucks next door to Munch Box and decided to drop in for breakfast a couple days ago. It was so amazing! I had a breakfast bagel with eggs and bacon. It was so good and the ingredients were fresh. Customer service was great. All in all a great experience!"}
{"text":"This is one of my regular breakfast/ lunch spots. The staff is always very nice & welcoming they never take too long to make anything which I appreciate with my busy schedule. There are a lot of custom options for the menu as well which is awesome for special diets!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I wanted a lighter lunch after church while my husband wanted something heavier. We both got our wish. The food is made fresh so you meal comes hot. We both got different types of sandwiches with fries. Though if your looking for brunch they have omelets, pancakes, and other breakfast/ brunch choices. 
I will for sure bookmark and come back. I want to try it all. 

Only downside there is not much seating."}
{"text":"Great menu super friendly staff make for a nice place to grab a quick meal. Had the munch box ultimate bfast sammy and hubs had the munch box bfast plate. Both very good with a homemade taste. Would def come back and try lunch. Nice addition to our neighborhood dining choices."}
{"text":"Great fresh food! A lot of different items to choose from. Prices are very reasonable and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Ordered a BLT, which came out quick and was good.   Cashier seemed like he wanted to be elsewhere which was shown in his customer service."}
{"text":"This is our go-to breakfast spot. The Philly steak omelet is amazing. The staff is so helpful and you can customize your order.

I almost didn't want to write this review because when every realizes how great this place is it'll be so crowded. But seriously check this place out."}
{"text":"My family and I ordered a few things off the menu, I got the Lox bagel on a jalapeño cheddar bagel and let me tell you, it was delicious! Sisters got the Nutella pancakes and Denver Omelette (I think) & they both loved it! 

However, my dad thought the chicken cheese steak was alright. But then again, he's very picky with his food and didn't like the fact that there were jalapeños in his sand which lol which I didn't know. 

Other than that, very friendly people and great service! It's a hidden gem! Very affordable prices!"}
{"text":"Great home made style quality ordered at fast food great low prices.
Love the fresh good quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Low key hipster casual, fantastic food and on point service!
Eaten here a few times and have not been disappointed. Breakfasts are Ah-Mazing and lunch sandwiches are fresh and yummy. Determined to try the poutine next time"}
{"text":"This place has good cheese paper! 

If your unfamiliar with cheese paper, its that melted, crusty stuff stuck to the wrapper of your meal that i must scrape off and eat before my actual food. I meant to take a photo of my delicious sandwich but it was too messy/good to stop and capture. This is a great budget option for a quick lunch, especially for those that like breakfast all day. I grabbed the Tijuana on a jalapeno bagel and sausage and out the door in less than 5 minutes. The sandwich was a little heavy on this white sauce (could have been mayo) but aside from that i was happy. A melty mess of eggs, sausage and cheese is never something to complain about. And for $5.99 + tax, that's not terrible."}
{"text":"I can't get over how amazing the service is every time I come here ! Not to mention the food is SUPERB !! you can come get with reassurance that you're getting a good meal every time time. Defiantly my go to breakfast/lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident and I'm glad I did. The service friendly and fast. I was looking for breakfast Three egg ham and cheese omelet with potatoes, toast and coffee under 10 bucks. They serve Seattles best coffee . I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decided on this place because of the good reviews.  Decent decor, decent food.  

The cheese steak was good.  A little on the greasy side, but it is a cheesesteak.

The traditional lox was good.  Nothing to write home about.  I wish though that they would have toasted the bagel.  It would have been much better.  Also a bit more red onion for crunch would have been nice as well.

The poutine fries were excellent.  Cheese curds, gravy, fries... so good.

One suggestion for the owners... You need to vacuum the bottom of that bagel case.  Its kinda gross with all the crumbs and stuff that fall to the bottom.  Other than that a great spot for a decent breakfast."}
{"text":"The food was really good and I'm sorry but the guy who works there whoever he is well he needs to be more professional. He was all over with his serving gloves, touched everything and even the money then went back to making food. Kind of grossed me out :-/ but OJ was fresh and so was the food, till I noticed they don't change their gloves when handling other but food. I probably won't eat there again, unless they can be more clean. Too bad cause I like their bagel sandwiches. The coffee is good and strong reminded me of truck stop coffee. The lady who cashed us out was super nice as well :)"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a sandwich when you want something fresh and not a fast food joint. The staff is friendly, it's clean, and the food is delicious! It was so good I'm back for seconds. I'm not big on eating eggs but when it's on one of the sandwiches they make I can't help but eat every bite. I like the Tijuana hot, it's not a lot of fire but it has a good taste. I give it 5 stars because I haven't had a bad experience yet!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about Munch Box! The owners are amazing, the food is extra tasty and good to look at too! I got the Tijuana Hot breakfast sandwich with turkey and tomatoes. It was SO GOOD! It wasn't too spicy either, I feel like unless you can't eat any spice at all, you can enjoy this tasty item. We also tried the honey cake, which was heavenly, and the simple breakfast with a bagel. As I write this review I am already dreaming of going back and trying different things off their menu!"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices and friendly employees. I love being able to place my order online through Eat24 and picking it up. Always ready on time!"}
{"text":"This place is really good! I had the poutine burger combo which was a ton of food and reasonably priced. I definitely want to come back to try and build my own breakfast sandwich on a bagel. 

The burger was a 1/4lb patty with bacon, fried egg, cheese, cheese curds, and fries(on the burger) smothered in a thick beef gravy. Then the side of fries had to be almost 1lb alone. I love that the fries are thick and have the skin still on. All that, plus a soda for $13.

I restaurant itself is small; just a handful of tables. It's nicely designed and very simple. Great work!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times. I've felt confident in bring my friends and family here. It's a unique smaller establishment. The food it pretty good I've not ever had anything wrong with my meal. It's a good place to go to when you're looking for fast and casual. Plus I will definitely continue to visit because of how friendly the staff is. Nothing over the top about the place or food. However it's satisfying and cozy. I would suggest, better than fast food definitely and rivals any diner."}
{"text":"This place is bangin! 
We went out this morning in hopes to eat a nice big breakfast and that's what we got! So delicious and filling I don't think I've eaten since!(and that was at 11am!)

The owner and staff was very personable and friendly, they had conversations with us and really made us feel like we wanted to come back forsure! 

I'd recommend this place to anyone who is a breakfast fanatic!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and fresh food! Ordered the avocado chicken wrap with the tomato tortilla and fries. Everything tasted delicious! Fries remind me of much thicker In'N'Out fries and they have pink Himalayan salt in she shakers. I'm definitely coming back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Awesome small business!! Great for breakfast or lunch. Electronic billboard menus easy to read. Counter service fast and helpful. Prices affordable and under $10-on average. Recently visited for breakfast, tried poutine and breakfast sandwiches. The poutine was fantastic and HUGE! Great for sharing. Done the traditional way with raw-cut fries, cheese curds, and delicious brown gravy. 

You can build your breakfast sandwich and I recommend the croissant as a bread, it's super buttery and flaky. I opted for egg whites, spinach, and mushrooms with Swiss cheese. All of the veggies were fresh and not canned! A plus! The Tijuana Hot was also ordered and full of heat. Free coffees were offered with our order, a nice touch. The service was so friendly and efficient at Munchbox, and food delivered to table even though it's counter service. Definitely a spot for quick, inexpensive, and fresh brekkie! Yum!"}
{"text":"The customer service is awesome! 
The food is great!
A good place to chill, have a good breakfast and coffee and start the day."}
{"text":"Welcoming place with a tight, specific breakfast/lunch menu. Hostess (owner?) is as cute as she can be with a personality that is far greater then her 4'10\" height.

 Now for the food, which is the  reason for 4 stars, not 5. My wife's French toast breakfast was not done, mushy inside and the eggs were runny. I'm sure they would have fixed it, but we were pressed for time. The platter was plentiful and the fruit a nice touch.

  My breakfast sandwich (the staple of the menu) was very good. Not so sure it was the turkey sausage I ordered, but it was spicy.

  All in all, a good little place... and worthy of a 2d try"}
{"text":"Sandwich was reasonably priced and oh so delicious! Even got a free coffee just for checking in. The bathrooms were nice and clean just wish they had more seats."}
{"text":"We got the munch box breakfast with pancakes and I got my pancakes with Nutella and strawberries. The food came out super fast, and the portions were perfect! The food itself was also great, the sausage was exactly how I like it, the eggs and the hash browns were tasty, and the pancakes were amazing! It was the perfect amount of Nutella and strawberry. Not too little, not too much. The owner and his staff member were extremely friendly and attentive. I like that both of them checked on us to make sure we were enjoying our meal. They give out complimentary coffee Monday through Friday which is also awesome! Definitely coming back my next visit!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out.
It was not busy when i went to pick it up. Place was clean and the staff was friendly.
I got the turkey grilled cheese sandwich on the brioche bun from their lunch menu with a side of fruit. I don't know why i got a side fruit, should have gotten fries. Sandwich was good, better with Tapatio. Brioche bun was underwhelming, would have been better with a croissant or everything bagel. Next time order with my stomach and not my head.
Side of fruit was the typical green grapes, pineapple, cantaloupe, and honeydew melon. Like i mentioned before, i should have gone with my stomach and got the fries. Their fries seem to have great reviews.

This is the second time i have been and i'll most likely will be back.
Great place to grab a quick breakfast or lunch sandwich without going to your typical fast food. I recommend also preordering through yelp. Very convenient to walk in and walk out without waiting for your food especially when you are busy."}
{"text":"Just solid food. Every time. You get more than you pay for and the service is personable and professional. Maybe the best fries in town. Bonus."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to check out Munch Box! I drove by it for so long, so I thought I should actually try it out. Let me start by saying the service was amazing. The staff is very enthusiastic, helpful, and informed. The food options are awesome for breakfast and lunch with a lot of \"build-your-own\" options. I opted for the wrap which I filled with breakfast fillings such as eggs, turkey, cheese, spinach, & mushrooms. The only reason that Munch Box is not getting 5 stars from me yet is for the lack of flavor that my wrap had. Tasted like the eggs, meat, and veggies had no seasoning on them which was sort of disappointing. I will be back to give it another try though! I also enjoyed their station of hot sauces and condiments which helped enhance the flavor of my meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally stopped in here for lunch yesterday. We've eyed this spot for awhile, but have always curved left to Stephano's instead. I'm glad we finally made our way into Munch Box.

There is a giant menu board on one wall of the restaurant so it's easy to see all of the menu options and make a selection. The woman that took our order was very friendly and warm. She even checked in on us after we had our food to make sure we were enjoying our meals. The restaurant is small inside with only five or six tables, but it seemed to be working out that a table was always available as needed. Pricing was really reasonable and I would consider this an inexpensive lunch option. 

The menu had many enticing options, but the Poutine Burger on the specials board is what ultimately caught my attention. I was warned that it would take 7-8 minutes to prepare because it's made fresh. This was no problem at all and I appreciate that the food is prepared fresh here. The burger was very delicious and the poutine on top was really good. The fries in the poutine had a great flavor and the gravy was really good. I went with a salad as my side option and it came with a delicious raspberry vinaigrette. My husband had the Turkey Grilled Cheese. He thought it was good, but he would probably try something more exciting next time.

Overall, Munch Box has delicious food and friendly service at a reasonable price. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that i am not a huge bagel fan.
The bagels I've had in the past we're nothing special, the usual..
I was looking through yelp looking for a breakfast joint nearby, and I stumbled upon this place. I flipped through the pictures and it looked pretty tasty so I decided to give it a try. Well let me just say that this is the best bagel I've ever had  !!
I ordered the \" ultimate\" bagel and it was huge!
They do have other options besides bagels, but so far their bagels are all I've tried and I'm hooked. I'd recommend this place to anyone, it never disappoints"}
{"text":"I randomly came across this place while running errands and decided to stop in. The all day breakfast sign had me sold! They have a plethora of breakfast and lunch items including omelets, fancy pancakes and what I ordered.. build your own sandwiches/wraps. I got a spinach wrap with egg whites, turkey sausage and veggies. It came our fresh and fast and for a reasonable price. The free coffee with check in was a nice touch and their staff makes you feel at home"}
{"text":"I got the munch box ultimate sandwich and my friend got the phillycheesesteak sandwich. Both very delicious."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now, and have been super happy with the everything. I'm currently downing the power greens salad, and I gotta say, for the price, it can't be beat. They don't skimp on the good stuff like the sunflower seeds, walnuts, and strawberries. And I even got a free drink to boot! The quinoa and eggs is a great menu item to try. Healthy, full of protein, and customizeable. A nice take the old classic egg breakfast.

I love the food here. They aren't trying to reinvent the wheel. They keep it simple, fresh, and healthy (well, mostly healthy...depending on what you pick off the menu!) The portions are on the generous side as well. It's always just enough for me.

It's a great lunch destination. The service is really fast and the staff are super friendly. There's always room to have a seat and stay awhile."}
{"text":"After going there recently for lunch, I'm really surprised at the overall 4.5 star rating. We got two sandwiches, two drinks, and a side of hashbrowns that was just a thin potato patty ($2 extra!) for $36. It was insanely expensive for what we received. 

Neither of us liked our meals. I got the salmon, onion, cream cheese, caper bagel sandwich. Everything about it was clunky. The onions were cut too large, the salmon was not the highest quality and it was also cut into huge pieces. They use a heavy cream cheese instead of a nice light whipped cream cheese that was spread so I thick, I had to take some off.  Not one ingredient in that sandwich was of high-quality and everything kept falling off. It was like a teenager with no food prep skills was in the kitchen that day.  I saw the two people making food that day...and they weren't teenagers.

Not to be mean, but their name on that day could've been 'clunk box.' The pictures on their menu are much better looking than what they're actually serving. I'm giving two stars for the location and the cashier who was incredibly friendly, helpful, and bubbly."}
{"text":"Quick service! The nicest people ever. Whoever makes the baklava is pure Genius or evil my hips haven't decided yet. :-). Overall, good food."}
{"text":"My new go to spot for breakfast! The Tijuana Hot is one of my favorites! Staff is always great and place is super clean. Good work guys!!"}
{"text":"Just came and tried out the Fort Apache location after being a fan of their Henderson spot! Finally a good breakfast spot for me to enjoy when I'm on the west side of town! I got a build your own bagel sandwich and build your own croissant sandwich (yes I was hungry and really excited!) HIT THE SPOT!! Will be back and definitely recommend it to all my friends and family!"}
{"text":"We use the Yelp app for our delivery of the food and it didn't give us options on the different types of sides we wanted like hash brown or home potatoes or fruit salad something like that. So when the delivery came we were a bit disappointed of the things that we received cuz it wasn't quite what we ordered. I called the restaurant to let them know that the order was done wrong and how the app had mentioned different things that are on the app but I didn't received in the order, So the manager or whoever it was that I spoke to was very nice and they said that they would comp the order. I'm giving this rating because the service I received over the phone was very good. 
Now the food on the other hand that is something that I probably might not want to order again. We had ordered the southwestern omelet and the munch Box breakfast and chicken tenders and fries for our little one. 
I really can't say much for the Munch Box breakfast cuz that was the one that was ordered wrong it came in as a sandwich so we just picked it out from the bread and just ate the innards of the sandwich you know the eggs the sausage and that was pretty much it. The omelette was good but was hoping that they had the side of fresh fruit salad rather than the home fries that I received. Again since the app was not able for me to choose on home fries or fresh fruit the website stated supposed to come with fresh fruit however when I received it it came with the home fries. The home fries we got just was full of spices that's all you could taste just spice couldn't even really taste the potatoes much. So that was really disappointing. 
The staff is great. They did right by crediting back the orders that was wrong. I would go back to eat there again, but I think we'll explore the other options on the menu."}
{"text":"New location on 6105 S Fort Apache rd.  Service great and the food is delicious. Had the munch box poutine burger. Order on the side / separate- the fries,gravy and cheese curds together and Then the burger, cheddar cheese,bacon tomato and egg.  Good stuff.  Lots of parking, order ahead convenience."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 star reviews, but the Tijuana hot breakfast sandwich on a jalapeño cheddar bagel with some yucateca hot sauce was amazing.

I'm a breakfast sandwich fiend and this is top 3 in the US of all my traveling."}
{"text":"The Munch Box is absolutely the perfect place to eat a delicious breakfast or lunch. The atmosphere is so comfy and cozy; I was surprised when I walked in to see a small seating area and an area next to it for cooking where you can watch your meal be made. The staff that works here is extremely friendly and welcoming. Im a vegetarian and when I go out it's usually hard to find yummy options. I tried the avocado grilled cheese sandwich and I basically went to food utopia. It was so delicious. It was full of delicious pepper jack cheese as well as a heap of yummy avocado. I would highly recommend this place to anyone with good taste in restaurants!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I get the poutine with pulled pork tenderloin whenever I come here. Should I try other things when I visit? Probably, but the poutine is so good that I have no reason to switch it up. The serving size is enormous and delicious. They definitely do not skimp on the pork.

The atmosphere is casual and laid back. Service is quick. Prices are excellent. There's no reason to go to a chain like Einstein's when you could be going to this place. The only negative is that I wish it were open later so that I could come here for dinner if needed."}
{"text":"Decided to try this out cause Tropical Smoothie was closed and I'm glad I did. The service was quick and I was even offered a free coffee while I wait for my to-go order.  The veggie wrap was okay.. I felt like something was missing but it was good.  The fruit salad that came with it was fresh.  I would go back and try something they're popular for like breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"This place is a gem of a find. I had lunch the other day and she offered me a vegetarian warps served pizza style. She said I'll love it and it tastes superb and healthy. Today I'm having one of the best lox bagel sandwiches. 

The breakfast and lunch \"pop\" because of the owners diverse backgrounds they give it a flare that needs to be tasted.

C'mon over the owner Azzy is a great host !"}
{"text":"I had the Tijuana Hot and it was great. My wife had the avocado grilled cheese with turkey. We had our 20 mo old daughter with us and they gave her some makers and paper to draw on. Very nice people! Great customer service. So glad we found this place. I will definitely come back based on customer service and great food! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I'm very generous with my review on this particular visit even if it was my first time because it was the only breakfast brunch place that was in the immediate area that had no wait time! 
It was a Sunday morning, around 1030, and we had a party of 6. Our original plan was Egg Works but upon pulling into the parking, it was clear that we'd have to wait and my kids were not going to be able to wait any longer. 
I called two other places, Munchbox was the third and the winner! They said there was no wait and they were about three minutes away! We zipped right over.

The store was clean, with a soda fountain, and drink station in one corner and a very attractive menu board next to the counter. The Poutine was calling my husband and his BFF so they split that and a pastrami San. They praised both. In fact the staff couldn't say which San was the better of the two. Btw, the staff and cooks were very friendly! Yep, you can talk to the cooks, and watch them whip up your meals too! I'm a sucker for bagels and for anything lox...so it was only natural for me to get the traditional lox, it had a bit too much cream cheese, but I usually tell people light on the cheese and forgot to do it this time. Our other friend ordered some egg white scramble with veggies and a side of fruit, it looked delicious, and she mentioned that it was. We both agreed that we need to order the scrumptious looking salad pictured on the menu. So we'll have to be back.

It's not a type of place that'll seat you but, the girl who helped us saw that we were eating in and she politely set up a table for the six of us! Oh and the coffee, and fountain drinks are refillable."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what I was in the mood for but this place just caught my eye. We went in, and was quickly met with some great friendly customer service. The food choices are amazing, the prices are very good. Our cheesesteaks tasted amazing with great amounts of meat. There is ample seating indoors and out. Location is close to freeway, with lots of parking. The staff was extremely friendly with our needs. I'm still in awe by it. Will most def recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! The breakfast sandwich ( Tijuana Hot to be exact) was the best thing ever.  It was the perfect combo of everything and literally melted in your mouth.  To top it off, we ordered a side of homemade French fries and they were delicious.  And finally somewhere with fresh squeezed OJ!!  I honestly can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I get it now...the whole Poutine thing. It really is a total comfort food. With fries, cheese curds melting in with rich brown gravy, you almost can't go wrong.  For an added upcharge, you can add pork tenderloin in it too if you want some protein to go with your carbs and dairy. I decided not to. The portion size of the Poutine was a good size for the price. They also offer bagel sandwiches and omelettes. A good crowd was already in there when I walked in. Customer service was friendly and kept the line moving. While waiting for my carb adventure, I had the chance to look over the menu to see if there was something else for future breakfast options. Although there was, the price for the bagel sandwiches and the kid's menu seemed kinda high. They offer pancakes with a side of Baskin Robbins ice cream for one of their kid's option. Not my personal favorite option for kids, but to each their own. Might come back to try some if their other items, but I think the Poutine would be the item worth recommending to come and check this place out."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We came here one morning before school. We ordered poutine, a bagel sandwich that my son loaded with vegetables n meat- he loved it. Also French toast with strawberries n bananas. Everything was great. I highly recommend this place if you want to try something fresh and quick."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Food is really good with generous portions and the staff are very friendly and excellent customer service. I definitely recommend coming here it's one of the best breakfast lunch spots in town!"}
{"text":"I was looking through Yelp to find a new place to try and Munch Box caught my interest! 

Customer service - Amazing! The entire staff was very friendly, especially the woman with the short blue hair on cashier. 

Food - The Tijuana breakfast sandwich I ordered was ok, probably won't order it again. I also got the poutine and I'm definitely going back for that! It was super yummy!! 

The only downside is that the place is pretty small so there isn't very many seats. Also the menu is pretty big and it would of been helpful for them to explain it a little more to us.

Overall, I really enjoyed my visit and I recommend you to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Food is simply Ahhhhhhmazing!!!  If you haven't been here, hurry.  Seriously some of the best food I've ever had!"}
{"text":"My mom saw the sign for this place as we were taking my niece to school one morning.  We kept saying, \"We should try that place one day\" just about every time we passed.  Well, that \"one day\" came and we decided to go in a try it out.  

When we walked in, we were greeted by the 3 staff that were working behind the counter.  Very nice. We took a gander at the menu to see what would satisfy our hungry bellies. When we were ready, he was ready with a smile. I ordered the avocado grilled cheese with french fries (yes, starch on starch), my mom ordered the Simple Breakfast which came with 2 eggs, hash brown, sausage and toast, and my niece, being the picky eater she is, got pancakes.  

After our order was placed, we took a seat and waited.  The wait was not long, though! Our food came out in a jif.  On to the goods, my grilled cheese was very good, with the right amount of cheese. They didn't skimp on the cheese, which can make or break a grilled cheese. The avocado was just right! So good. And those fries! I like my fries to have a little crunch to them, and that's exactly what they had, a crunch. Not all of them, for those of you wondering about my teeth. My mom really enjoyed her meal, especially the sausage. My niece even stole some pieces of the plate. 

My mom took my niece to the bathroom, and one of the guys behind the counter asked me if my niece at all her food. I replied yes, and he brought out a treat for her! I thought that was so nice of him. Definitely a family mentality. She was very surprised when she came back from the bathroom.

I'm so glad we made it in to Munch Box, after days of anticipation. We mostly definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Just wow.  I was totally intending on stopping into subway, and on a whim popped my head in.  I love options, and this place has them. In abundance.  I built a breakfast bagel, got some fruit salad and a soda.  Service was quick polite, and dare I say - fun!  The young lady behind the counter was engaging and sassy, two things I ALWAYS enjoy in a dining establishment.

I will definitely be going back for a round two."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a quick bite! The food is made fresh and tastes amazing. For those breakfast lovers, you can get breakfast ALL DAY!! There are so many things on the menu and you can even make a custom meal. Wonderful find! Will be going back. Make sure to check in on yelp as they currently have a 10% off your order"}
{"text":"I'm starting off with we ordered from Postmates it showed up hot and fresh ... this is our 3rd order from here each thing has been great ! My 9 year old got the bacon burger he said he gives it 5 stars .. I got the bagel Tijuana Hot with bacon and eggs .. very yummy !!! We in our house like our French fries these are super yum"}
{"text":"Ordered the build a breakfast w/home fries and it was delicious. A little more flavor is wanted from me but I'm Mexican and used to spice. Space is limited but most were picking up food. Service was excellent and the front woman seemed genuine and kind. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'll be quick since I'm watching Game of Thrones reruns...

The girl working the register knew the menu and gave a great first impression. She sold me on a croissant breakfast sandwich with egg, hashbrowns, pepper jack, and bacon.

The bacon and eggs were burnt, so I ate a little of those and removed them from the sandwich. This left me with a lifeless croissant, cheese, and hashbrown mix, which was ok.

I also got a free soda, but the coke was kind of flat.

I went in there expecting a really good sandwich based on a yelp status of 4.5 stars and got something I wouldn't make at home. I'd actually be embarrassed to serve a sandwich like that. 

Please don't burn eggs and bacon. Also, make the sandwiches more flavorful somehow. But keep those girls up front. They were professional and friendly. Without them this review would be a 1 star!"}
{"text":"This was my 'fallback' spot after seeing the Chick-Fil-A line was still to the moon and back but this place is even better (although different) 
Hands down the best breakfast sandwich or maybe even sandwich in general I've ever had. If I didn't have to eat healthy I could eat this every day. Could barely finish half my bagel but that means leftovers. Absolutely perfect hangover spot.
Nicest staff!"}
{"text":"The lox is good on jalapeño and cheddar bagel, I got the ultimate on croissant with turkey sausage. It was outstanding. But the five stars is for customer service. They saw that my dog was outside sitting with us and Kevin J gave him a piece of bacon and pet him. That alone, will bring us back every morning again and again and tell everyone about it."}
{"text":"A new cute little cafe I discovered today! Loved the ambiance, owner/workers and food. The chicken avocado wrap I had with the tomato wrap was pretty good, for me it was a little dry because there was no sauce with it. It would have been nice with like a light vinaigrette or something along those lines, but the chicken was delish. It came with a side with choices being a fruit salad, mixed greens or fries; I chose the fruits! Much yummm. I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Below mediocre. Everything was canned or frozen. I watched the cook use his cell phone in between orders and did not change his gloves. You can make better breakfast at home. I like the concept but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful little Hole in the Wall-
Made to order fresh tasting ingredients, fries are REAL and done very well.
Simple seating arrangement and very clean.

Simply put- try them out, fair pricing, great tasting fresh ingredients, customizable sandwich options.

LOVED the turkey avocado grill cheese on sour dough!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the first time I got the avocado grilled cheese. Loved it! The 2nd time I tried the Tijuana Hot without meat and added hash browns. It was good just a little too much cream cheese for me. Gonna stick with the avo grilled cheese. Fries are bomb here!"}
{"text":"Quick simple menu and fresh food! Portions are good and service was refreshing. Glad I came here instead of the other egg place with a long wait."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My mother in law is in town and we wanted to check out a new spot somewhere near the house so after searching on Yelp we came across this spot... the decor and the way everything is set up is super cute...they have all your needs for drinks , sauces and anything extra you might need... the place is really clean and the service was great! The chick with the blue hair was awesome! She had fantastic customer service and was genuinely super sweet and cool... we all ordered something different and all love the food! Everything made fresh on the spot and it tasted delicious! Will be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"I herd great things about this place. I tried the build your bagel sandwich, it was pretty good. But then it came with home fries. They were pretty disgusting. Super super super soggy, it had this super thick coating of \"seasoning\" yet it had no salt or pepper. I'll never order those again and It's pretty over priced."}
{"text":"I was semi high and I came here for some grub. This place is fucking litty and the philly cheesesteak here is dank as fuck. Poutine was drenched in gravy, which made the fries softer than Kevin Durant. I piled that shit onto my cheesesteak and my tastebuds were cumming!.&"}
{"text":"Amazing! I was brought here by some friends and wow. The veggie burger and fries was delicious, and the woman up front was so helpful and nice. Will definitely be back! Great food, awesome customer service, and the prices are not bad!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service!! Our family stopped by for an early dinner around 4:30 and was super impressed with how cute and very clean it is! 
We got veggie **breakfast wrap- SOOOO good & healthy! **French Toast-- homemade fluffy deliciousness! **The Simple breakfast plate- house potatoes are so good and the croissant (for toast side) was the perfect side with the eggs & bacon! 
Our new fave spot!!"}
{"text":"1 star. Because it wasn't good. No stars would be the best raiting. And a waste of my time and $$$$. This was not a good choice for early lunch.no,no,no! one plate of food was grease filled and not appetizing. I picked up my food and it was dripping with liquid margarine.  The food is pricey, and tables were not comfortable to eat at . The people in line have there butts in the tables, where we were sitting Eating. It's weird. The table set up is in the to go line. Little Caesar's was better.,and thats saying alot. Also the staff isn't very friendly, and I felt like she really wasn't listening to what I was ordering,  it's was underwelming"}
{"text":"I was really satisfied with my experience here! The woman who took my order was extremely helpful in my decision-making process which is really nice because most of the time people will just stand there and wait for you to make a choice. I told her that I wasn't really feeling meat so she was like ok how about we add some avocado instead which is exactly what I wanted hear!

She was so nice and checked in on me frequently even though it was a pay first then sit down kind of place. Then I got my food in a timely fashion, and it was just delicious for a simple as it was, it was really delicious. The chef also came and checked on me which I appreciated. 

I would say the only negative I have is that they give out plastic forks and knives, which is fine...but I had French toast and it was hard to cut through and I feel like I was almost going to break the knife at times. Overall, I would definitely come back to try other things. :)"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since I saw the sign go up. Finally the moment presented itself one morning when a friend and I was waaaaay too early for work. Inside was clean so that was a great start. 

I had high hopes which all came crashing down when first they told us they only have regular coffee. Small kine disappointed but hey Starbucks is next door so no biggie. Second offense was when they asked what kind of bagel I wanted my Classic lox on and they tell me nope no sesame seed bagel on stock. Hmmm now we're two for two. I refused to give up lol but sadly the Classic lox bagel was quite a disappointment. I could understand how they can't compete with my favorite French cafe but to be inferior compared to bagel chain Einstein was a little disheartening. 

My friend said she didn't really care much for her bacon and egg bagel sandwich either. Also price wise is a little on the higher side for the quality of food you get $21+ for 2 sandwiches. Oh well lesson learned, next time maybe I'll try their other offerings."}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast place ever! Always our go-to on Sundays. Can't say I've tried anything other than the ultimate breakfast sandwich because it's so good! I do wish they had breakfast burritos though."}
{"text":"First of all I like to say if you haven't eatin' here you are missing out on best breakfast in town.  Since we try this last month we've gone back here almost every weekend with my kids. Surprisingly my kids eat their food,  if my kids eats that means it must be so good...\" picky kids\".  But not only the food is great, also the customer service they provided are great.  Always walking and asking people how's the food and everything.  I mean you don't get this kind of treatment no more around town.  All I have to say is this place is the best all around."}
{"text":"Love the Gravy Fries!  I found this place to be clean, parking was easy, and the service was friendly & fast.  This would be a great place to go have lunch."}
{"text":"Wow! Highly impressed, just visited Vancouver a couple of months ago and this place did not fail to hit the \"authentic\" portion of the poutine! My boyfriend and I ordered the philly cheesesteak with the poutine on the side for an extra 4 dollars. It tasted almost exactly like the poutine from our ferry in B.C. Definitely will be coming back and would love to try there breakfast menu as well!"}
{"text":"Healthy and delicious lunch if you're looking for a quick bite.  What was even cooler was that we got this lunch delivered.  Too often we find ourselves in the hustle and bustle of work, that we forget to take a moment and enjoy one of the 3 most important meals of the day.  I'm glad that joints like this exist for a solid and nutritious meal."}
{"text":"I am absolutely impressed with this family run bistro. They have a great following in the neighborhood. It's always busy. The staff is always welcoming and friendly. The service is great. It feels comfortable enough to dine inside. 

The food is delicious with generous portions. I am very happy they serve POUTINE. As a Canadian, I approve of their dish. It's delicious and they did not skimp on any ingredient. The gravy is delicious, the cheese is gooey and perfect poutine cheese. The fries are soggy due to the toppings and this is the poutine test. Dry crispy fries means not enough toppings. Soggy means....DIG IN! This is what brought me here in the first place! But I've sampled other menu items and am definitely impressed. 

The one item I was disappointed in was the grilled cheese. It was OK, but I suspect it contained processed cheddar slices. Meh."}
{"text":"Originally opened in Anthem around the beginning of September 2016 it was largely a matter of distance that prevented prior visits to Munch Box, but when Avo Jabourian opened a second location in Spring Valley the excuses became null and void - a catering order on Wednesday showing that despite a broad menu of fairly \"common\" items the execution is proper while prices are an outright bargain.

Not advertising or paying for 'influence' like so many other Restaurants, a flood of photos from the same ten people apparently not enough to save Salute or Libre or Crave, it has instead been by way of good ol' word of mouth and honest cooking that Munch Box has become one of a handful of independently owned concepts to capture the hearts of regulars, most people who've been speaking fondly of specific items that were focused on when ordering.

Not 'fancy' by any stretch, though ingredient quality is on par or superior to the likes of Panera while check averages are similar despite a significant upgrade in creativity, it was with timely delivery from Avo himself that Staff unwrapped Sandwiches and unsnapped plastic containers, first bites of Munch Box's \"Tijuana Hot\" Breakfast Sandwich quickly explaining the item's praise as one of Sin City's better Bagels was packed full of fluffy Eggs plus crisp Bacon and a gooey blend of Cheddar with piquant Cream Cheese. 

Given the opportunity to taste a half-dozen of over fifteen items selected, Burgers receiving top marks from those who partook, it was immediately upon opening a box of \"Authentic\" Poutine that lips formed a smile, the hand-cut Fries maintain good structure beneath nothing but Brown Gravy and squeaky Curds just as they should while a Pulled Pork Tenderloin  Sandwich slathered in Slaw was a little sweeter than Carolina-style but not overly-saturated with Sauce and thus a nice balance of flavors with a portion large enough to share for most.

Surprised at how well most items had held up in transport, everything including a Smoked Salmon Plate and Denver Omelet arriving temperature-appropriate, it was largely a matter of the seared Beef's juiciness that rendered the Bun of Munch Box's Philly Cheesesteak a touch wet, the flavors nonetheless quite good depending on one's preference for melted Provolone versus the thick orange goop featured at Tony Luke's.

Opened at 7a Monday through Friday and 8am on Weekends, a Breakfast Menu thus necessary, it was in place of \"Dessert\" that Pancakes and French Toast stood-in, the promise of 100% Pure Maple Syrup unfortunately unfulfilled as Smucker's was found in a bag of condiments, the fact that this writer actually keeps a bottle of Vermont's best in his desk due to similar experiences in the past thankfully allowing thick slices of griddled Bread to be enjoyed as they should be though ay future order will instead focus on dinner-plate sized Pancakes that reminisce of the Golden Arches in terms of flavor but with a better rise whether covered in Nutella and Berries or in \"Everest\" form with Bacon Strips, tender Sausage and crispy Spuds."}
{"text":"Came in on a whim and was blown away.  The food was phenomenal and huge! Way more food than even I could finish!

I had the strawberry Nutella pancakes.  They came with organic maple syrup.  It was absolute heaven.
They even tossed in a complementary fountain drink. 

The people who work there are super nice as well, and the place was very clean.  

Highly recommend and will be back with friends!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy coming to munch box.The foods really great(taste) and staff seem to be genuinely nice and accommodating. They serve breakfast all day fresh emphasis on Fresh along with everything. Portions are right The Price is Right the food is right can't ask for anything more"}
{"text":"We are so happy that we stopped by this place. The food is great and fresh. It's a family run restaurant. The poutine is just like in canada. Best French fries. You need to try this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly staff, and a great atmosphere! I've had their poutine, ultimate breakfast sandwich, and their chicken salad (can't recall the name) and NOTHING ever disappoints. They took a simple idea and made it their own. No quirks, just awesome food. And FRESH SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE!?  Who doesn't love that!"}
{"text":"Simply the best breakfast/lunch sandwich or whatever you want to call it I've ever had yet.

I had the Tijuana with extra cheese! I don't know what type of sauce or magic they put in this creation; I need to know because this was literally a orgasm in my mouth 

I also ordered the traditional lox sandwich (look at the menu) I'm really picky when it comes to a bagel & salmon together & what did they do? Come back for more.

If you're looking for a brunch place with good food and customer service, look no further.


Love,

A Fat Asian Girl named Mandee"}
{"text":"Blown away had the Turkey avo grilled cheese....so good and so much . Very nice environment people so freindly"}
{"text":"Upon ordering take-out here, I descended into a straight up food coma. The portion size is huge! I've always seen the Munchbox on Snapchat and Instagram stories, but never made my way over despite living down the street; however, I'm glad that Yelp lead us here today. For being a Tuesday afternoon, there was a decent crowd. Regardless of that, the cashier was fast to greet us and to take our order. He was also patient and informative about menu items. I ordered the Munch Box Ultimate with cheddar bagel, American cheese, and turkey and my boyfriend ordered the Poutine burger. Suffice to say, we were not expecting the size of either sandwiches when we got home. It was so savory and delicious though. Every bite was full of flavor. On top of that, the location is convenient and in the Smith's shopping center on Eastern and Horizon Ridge. I would highly recommend coming here for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite restaurant in Henderson for breakfast and lunch. They are a vegetarian friendly restaurant at a good price! Thanks for the delicious and healthy food"}
{"text":"Legit! Great coffee and super nice owners. Really good bagel sandwiches and poutine.

Be careful how much stuff you try to put on your bagel. They get really messy and hard to eat."}
{"text":"Hmmm, updating my review.....not sure what happened but the food here has taken a turn. Not well made ..maybe it was the delivery for taking too long but by the time it got here it was not good at all. Inedible and soggy."}
{"text":"I've been seeing this come across my yelp from time to time so I decided to stop in..... omg am I glad!!! I was going to take a picture of my food but I devoured it before I could!!! I had the turkey avocado grilled cheese on croissant with fries and my hubby had a chicken avocado wrap with fries..... both were amazing!! I will definitely be back!! Everything was fresh and the employees were so nice!!!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good! Great prices, fresh food, friendly service, and they feed you good! So. Many. French fries! Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Food is mouth wateringly delicious & Staff is super friendly and helpful. I can't seem to try anything new when my boyfriend and I go in, but that is only because the breakfast sandwich is soooo yummy! I would recommend however, that you cook your hash browns in an air fryer or make them a little crisper on the grill-you get that oily aftertaste. Other than that, everything is wonderful and consistent. Thank you for sharing your amazing food with me and my family!"}
{"text":"For the amount of money you're paying, the food isn't worth it. I spent about 20$ for an egg sandwich and orange juice when I spend about 8$ at Einsteins for the same exact quality food! Appreciate that it is family owned though"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff ! Really fresh ingredients! bagel sandwiches are delicious love this place"}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast/brunch spot! 
They offer a variety of yummy sandwiches, pair it with a cup of their fresh ohhhhh jay!"}
{"text":"The french toast with fruit was not only a huge portion but it was also delicious.   The munch box ultimate sandwich was awesome and the fresh squeezed orange juice was a perfect addition to our meal!! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This location has been a challenge for all the past owners and I'm so happy to see the NEW owners taking on this place with a passion for food and service!  The breakfast bagels are deliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiicious and I'm still trying to get around to the lunch menu!"}
{"text":"Pregnant woman approved! Craving poutine and this place nailed it!  Amazing food, friendly staff, unusual music... it was great! Was planning to take it to-go but just couldn't wait and busted out the food right there. *yummm*"}
{"text":"The food is so yummy and the cashier girl was so sweet. I really enjoyed the different styles of sandwiches to choose from, wheat, bagel, white etc. The food was cooked perfectly and I will totally come back for some bomb breakfast. It's a quick bite and perfect for any hangover."}
{"text":"This was the most Amazing bagel sandwich I have had in years. Everything was cooked to perfection. The bagel was toasted perfectly. The CSR (Azzy) greeted us as we walked through the door and she was extremely helpful. She explained the menu & was very patient while we made our decisions. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for that perfect breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I were going to have lunch at Stephanos and came across Munch Box. We decided to give it a try and are so glad we did! The menu is at the front before you even walk in so you know what to expect. We both ordered the specialty burger (starts with a P) which included appetizing gravy, egg, tomato and so much more. It also includes fries, fruit, or greens as a side. The gravy on the burger was phenomenal. They have other delectable choices too such as a philly cheese steak sandwich and a bacon and cheddar burger. Finally, the young lady at the counter was so welcoming and attentive. Please stop by and give this local burger joint a try!"}
{"text":"Loved this place you can get a great breakfast or lunch fast and for a great price! Wish I would have known it was so close sooner! Will definitely be back so yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has some great food eats for anytime of the day or week! Starting with serving breakfast all day long certainly offers some great pancakes as well as bagels eggs and of course who could forget bacon! Don't forget to add your orange juice or coffee. 
They also offer lunch menu items as well as a specific kids menu. 
The staff was on point and very friendly, quick to deliver and prepare food. The establishment itself has several tables and chairs so even groups can pull together and hang out.

Back to the food, did I mention pancakes! 
While the offer many other breakfast items I definitely have some great pancakes, and I will certainly be revisiting soon as this location is just a couple miles from my house and to add great hours throughout the week open till 5 PM  even Saturdays and even open on Sunday 8-2pm!.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere friendly staff and the food there is amazing. Only had breakfast and poutine so far"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast! I had a jalapeño bagel with turkey sausage and fried egg with avocado and onions! Was so good. I also got some fresh fruit and fresh squeezed orange juice. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great food and portions. Everything made Fresh and to order. Have you try the ultimate breakfast sandwich"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is really adorable, clean and all around great atmosphere for a little breakfast/lunch place.  The food is AMAZING and the prices are insanely reasonable.  They have lots of choices for bread/bagels.  The man that handled our order was the nicest guy ever.  He offered to give my husband an extra choice of cheese since he chose not to get meat on his breakfast sandwich (vegetarian).  They honored the 'free coffee when you check in with yelp' coupon.  My one and only complaint is that they don't make decaf coffee (I can't have caffeine), but there is a coffee bean right next door, so my husband got the free coffee and got me a decaf from next door.  He got the make your own breakfast sandwich for $6, choosing jalapeno cheese bagel for bread, and added fries for $2.  I got the turkey avocado grilled cheese with 'Mom's fries.'  I am so coming back here!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for great breakfast or lunch in a friendly causal atmosphere this is the place! Always an excellent choice!!"}
{"text":"First time Munch Box visitor and walking in at around 10:45am Wednesday morning it was quiet -so we must have missed the breakfast rush.

I got the egg and  cheddar cheese sandwich on whole wheat and it was out in less than 5 minutes - the bread was toasted just right and the egg was scrambled. Yummy! Oh and I got the freshly squeezed OJ too. 

My hubby got the Philly cheesesteak and that thing was enormous! I got to have a bite and everything was Delish! Bread was fresh and soft. The meat was cooked and seasoned nicely. It came with a side salad which looked fresh and tasty too. This was off the lunch menu and came with a soda.

Note: this is an all day Breakfast and Lunch place! So good to know! 

And this is a family owned business - so support Local!

(and I believe this is their 2nd location here on Eastern Avenue!) 

Overall a great clean and cool place to eat in or take out!

And how could I forget.... super friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh and tasty. The staff was amazingly helpful and kind and I love LOVE that they have straight up, conscious, intended, vegan options. I would come here from time to time. Its not an all the time thing since we did spend over 30 dollars on two sandwhiches (before tip) and ya girl is very cheap. The vegan burger was fresh and good and tasted absolutely nothing like a burger. Which in my opinion is a good thing since I personally don't like the taste of meat. My omni wife on the other hand ordered a Philly and apparently the meat was cooked to perfection with good flavor. Sooo... There you go... A win from both of us!"}
{"text":"My food was pretty delicious. Fresh fruit. Cute little spot and very friendly people. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Come here almost everyday for lunch during my break.. and every time has exceeded expectations. I get the Poutine more than anything else. It's super good and the portion is a huge one! The staff is super friendly and always so welcoming. It's honestly what makes me come back! The lady cashier is awesome! I've also tried the Cheesesteak and it was great, so I'm sure everything else is as well!"}
{"text":"So we have been back many times since my first review... The breakfast sandwiches are amazing. I have also tried the avocado grilled cheese which I enjoyed very much. My daughter still will only have the bagels with lox, so they must be great."}
{"text":"We just loved this place! It's owned by a delightful, friendly young woman from Montreal. They have the traditional poutine of the region and it's fantastic! We also enjoyed lox and cream cheese on a cheddar bagel and a delicious breakfast sandwich. The service is excellent and it reminds us of a Chicago deli. Yummy!"}
{"text":"After reading all the 5 star reviews I called to place a to go order. I ordered a chicken and avocado wrap and a power greens salad and asked for chicken to be added. 

I arrived about 15 minutes later and still had to wait a good 10 minutes for my order to be ready. The chicken wrap was good but I didn't care for the mushrooms in it. I like mushrooms but it just didn't seem to pair well with the other flavors. 

The power greens salad was a nice mix of greens, a couple slices of avocado, cherry tomatoes, alfalfa sprouts and walnuts. The chicken (which was $3.50 extra) was served on the side in a separate container. 

Maybe the breakfast is better, but I thought Munch Box was very average. Can't see myself rushing back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"My first visit today. My 9 year old son recommended this place, (he went with Grandma and Grandpa). So glad I checked it out. We will be going back often. Love it! The owners are amazing! So friendly and very nice to talk to. She even went over to make fresh coffee right away, yum! We just moved here in August and I finally found my favorite place. Food is awesome, as well as the coffee. I ordered the lox and bagels, your get to choose a fresh bagel of your choice. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Omg! AWESOME! FRESH! Made to order! Super smiley greeting! Cool, hip vibe! Amazing food! I can't say enough about this place! I wanted to take my dad to get a quick bite after his dr appointment. I looked in Yelp n found this lil place! It was just great! Like I told the owner, this place would take off in San Diego! Just a great place with great service and amazing food! Keep doing what you're doing! It's working!"}
{"text":"I'm in the Las Vegas area 3-4 times a year because I have family there. My husband and I often look up businesses on Yelp and then go on little exploration adventures that take us all over the place. Lately, we keep finding ourselves venturing out to Henderson a lot because there are so many great spots out that way and one of those great spots is Munch Box.

The cashier was very friendly and walked us through all the ordering options. I opted to build my own breakfast burrito and my husband had the Tijuana bagel. Everything came out piping hot and the ingredients were all fresh. We even shared a side of poutine. The owners are from Montreal which explains the poutine and French radio station playing on the speakers. I love poutine and can never resist it so I was a happy camper to see it on the menu.

Their coffee was really good and they had a great variety of tea options as well. I also appreciated that they offered flavored coffee creamers and a few different hot sauce options.

The Munch box offers breakfast and lunch and there are so many options we'll have to keep coming back to try more items like the Bialy, love those. Actually they cater too so we may have to cater a family event to get to try more of their offerings."}
