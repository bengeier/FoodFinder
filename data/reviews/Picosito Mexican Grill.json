{"text":"Ordered a super burrito to go, meat was horrible didn't seem fresh at all I think the beans might if been old as well when I saw the burrito It didn't look appealing I knew it was going to dissapoint me, the salsa Verde was watery and had no flavor my wife had 3 tacos Which you can devour in bitterly a bite for like 1.50 asked them.for cheese and didn't get any simply poor Mexican food considering I'm Mexican don't think ill e'er go again they need to step it up."}
{"text":"Expensive ... too expensive for nothing fancy! Especally breakfast burritos! Over priced and charging ridiclous per sides if you want extra after its all said and done 10$-11$ for a burrito! What a joke Save your money!  Go to Fredricos, or Filbertos"}
{"text":"We started going  here about 2 months ago it's delish and the people who work here r super awesome & very kind.  Thank u always for great food and customer service!!! Support this local business the owner is wonderful!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so this is right down the road from me, so I thought convenience!  Unfortunately, that did not save this place.
1. menu is expensive.
2. Food is alright, but not memorable in any way really
3. The staff are pretty much worthless.  I went there 3 times... 3 times!  And each time they screwed up the order.  The girlfriend is vegitarian, and of course they still put meat in it, so she couldnt eat her dinner.  Then when we told them about this, they just said sorry and thats it.  The next time we went back we ordered churros, didnt get them, but they didnt forget to bill us!  Of course, when we called they said \"ohh well come back and you can have them.  Yes I get that, I paid for them, but lets not go out of our way and go above and beyond... lets just make me waste my time and gas for your screw up... and then there was another time they screwed it up.

So we have a rule.. 3 strikes and your out!  Would not recommend this place..."}
{"text":"The best red chile burrito in town (enchilada style). The man who runs the place is a friendly guy who takes care of his customers. The street tacos are really good too. I wish they had more restaurants around the valley."}
{"text":"decent food. Friendly people! Prices are a little high though. They do have specials though"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican place for lunch.  Flavors are not super memorable but good solid food.  Pork tacos were really good!"}
{"text":"This is the closest quick service Mexican to my home in T Town. The food is ok. the last 4 years the prices have steadily gone up. The burritos the hubs gets is the best deal. The ceviche is spicy, street tacos are good flavored but I stand by original review that the cost isn't worth the food portion. This isn't a full service restaurant & the cost is more than the local Filberto's but only a shade less than a Carlos O'Briens or Garcia's & with full service you don't have to ask for chips & can get a brew with your tacos. Now the street tacos that started at $1 ea are $1.59 ea however the meats & portions hasn't improved or changed to signify the premium cost. Too bad too because I'd rather go local all dang day long than frequent the local Filberto's but the food there is consistent, larger portions, close to the same $ & doesn't lock you out 10 minutes prior to close like this place does. Such a bum-mer."}
{"text":"I am a recent transplant from California and have been on the hunt for Mexican food that is on par with what I am used to. I was hesitant to order via UberEats because I have had terrible experiences with them, but I am so glad that I took the plunge. Tacos were on the smaller side, but there was tons of carne asada. Carne was of great quality and full of flavor. Veggies were fresh. Salsa tasted great, it just wasn't spicy as I had hoped. I have recommended Picosito to all of my coworkers and look forward to ordering again. Maybe tomorrow! :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Prices are fair for homemade food. I fully support this local business! Had the beans/rice chicken bowl. Mmm! Two thumbs up. Medium sauce is a perfect blend of flavor and heat. Had nice chat with the owner, she is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Solid little restaurant for a quick pick me up.  I do not understand the baby tacos that i have been experiencing at a lot of these types of restaurant.  They are literally the size of a dollar and cost 2. The price for what you get IS NOT WORTH IT. I think I said this about another taco place that I experienced.   The taste is great but just not into food that does not feel me up or is not bigger than the palm of my hand."}
{"text":"Want extremely small portions? This is your place.  Burritos are extremely skinny, cosido/caldo has 1 only one of each thing, the list goes on.  Not worth the price when they skimp on the product served."}
{"text":"Got our first order on uber eats. It was all pretty good except one big mistake, my chicken chimichanga was beef. Luckily, I'm not opposed to beef but being pregnant, I really wanted chicken(that's why I ordered it). It was still pretty tasty. Hard to cut through though. Beans and rice were good but the guacamole was eh. Great big chunks of avocado but the rest is over lemony pico. I'll give this place another try at some point but will when I'm in the area to order face to face."}
{"text":"Great food! Authentic Mexican cuisine/food and MSG and lard free for the health conscious too!"}
{"text":"I order sporadically from here. Usually for lunch. Though today, I got breakfast. Just simple, bacon, egg and cheese burrito. For Lunch; shredded beef burrito. The food is always delicious, prepared the way it's ordered and timely. Great food and customer service!"}
{"text":"Been here about five times since moving to the area, food is okay but too expensive for what you get.lots of better Mexican restaurants around Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had the Street Tacos. They were way too small, not enough meat. The tacos were more tortilla then anything else. They get 3 stars for good service."}
{"text":"I used to live near this restaurant and am vegan. They have the best veggie burritos I have ever eaten. In fact, every time I eat at another Mexican restaurant, I am disappointed. They could learn a thing or two from this humble place! The serving size is also great value for the money. 

What makes these veggie burritos so special starts with the tortillas which have an almost crisp, flaky texture. Inside they use diced potatoes, an uncommon but welcome ingredient. Also included are chunks of bell pepper and pleasant proportions of veggies, topped off with a sprinkling of black pepper. I skip the cheese and often have guacamole added.

They have a salsa bar with three different types of salsa. I go for a serving of the red and green. They also have a mixture of marinated carrots, jalapeños, and onions which are nice and soft. I usually eat that by itself and order some to take home to snack upon.

I have since moved away and whenever I am in the area, I make sure to stop by. I have similar small Mexican restaurants near me, but they all disappoint me for the following reasons: The tortillas are nothing special. The insides are nothing but rice and beans--bleh. The portions are small. The salsas are nothing special, and if they happen to have marinated carrots, jalapeños, and onions, the carrots are hard and everything is cut into large pieces that are difficult to eat."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time and I was made felt like I was bothering the employees. Asked for a carne asada burrito and the rice and beans that goes on the inside to be placed on the side to avoid it getting soggy. Was told it was going to charge four extra dollars to do that! \"Because it's different sizes\" I'm not asking for an additional side I'm asking for my sides to be put to the side. Just paid 9 dollars for a burrito with burnt meat that's not even asada but cheap roast beef. Will never go back"}
{"text":"Small place but great street tacos! Friendly staff, come check them out."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great flavor. Must try food. Really home made recipes. Flavor and quantity. The best."}
{"text":"I came here for an entire year before I moved from Phoenix. When I come to visit, this is one of my must stops.

I will admit the food is pricy and definitely not affordable, but my point of view is you get what you pay for, so the food better be delicious. And it always has been.

I was always satisfied with my orders. Meat is fresh, salsa is perfect, & the service was great. Never had a problem with any staff member.

My favorite was California burrito, Taquitos, chilaquiles, & tacos."}
{"text":"It's not the worst food.... The shrimp cocktail had 4 shrimp thats $1.25 per shrimp, 1/4 of an avocado and a few pieces of chopped onion... I'm not sure what the other dishes are like, but don't order this one...."}
{"text":"Our first time here, a small little place. Nothing fancy, I'm new to the area so I'm trying out all the close places to me. I think the menu is decent, prices are ok.. Portions are huge. I've seen some reviews saying small portions Idk maybe depends what you get. I ordered shredded hard tacos with rice and beans. I think they were all flavorful beans had a little kick to them. Salsa the green didn't have much of a kick... The avocado spicy, the red i didn't try but my husband said not good. He ordered a California super burrito and it was huge! He said it was really good. So we will be back. Staff was nice also."}
{"text":"They're tacos and burritos are good...I love horchata but there's is a little too watery"}
{"text":"I really like the food, I do. It's good. My issue is the service. 

The signs say they close at 7. However, they lock the front door at 6:40 and if you knock, you're out of luck. If they want to be out of there by 7, then they need to change their hours to closing at 6:30 and be done with it."}
{"text":"We didn't even stay to eat.  The place has great curb appeal.  That didn't save the trip.

1.  Staff was not friendly.  Only two people were on duty.  One was standing behind the counter staring into space or watching TV.  The other was sitting down eating.

2.  Doesn't appear to be too clean.

3.  Pricey for a little hole-in-the wall place.  Not a sit down restaurant and some of the dishes are $10!

4.  They serve \"off\" food.  Tongue.  Other weird assorted animal parts.

We stayed, read the entire menu, and then I whispered, \"Olive Garden?\" and we left.  Not worth a trip."}
{"text":"I like the breakfast potato and egg burrito, buts that's about it. We have been here a couple of times but have not been impressed. The huevos rancheros are a joke, the tortilla is supposed to be fried like a tostada, it's not supposed to be a plain tortilla.  The burrito de cabeza were so darned greasy that they made my husband sick, the grease would drip from it. The chile rellenos Are ridiculously expensive as well as the rest of the menu. Do yourself a favor and head down to the filibertos in front of Tolleson highschool for food that is half the price and twice the flavor and quality"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with a friend. My friend asked, \"What's good to eat here?\" The customer in front of us turns around and says \"Everything.\" I go here as often as I can. Favorite Mexican food place to where I live. I had the Super Carne Asada burrito. It tried its best to live up to its name but my appetite is bigger. Love the food here! Very cozy, but you will rarely find this place empty! Its a local favorite!"}
{"text":"Some co-workers wanted to order Mexican for lunch and passed around a menu for Picosito. I decided on the green chicken enchiladas (no lettuce, tomato, onion) with rice and beans. After the order was placed, I was informed that there was no green sauce so it would be red... Not my favorite, but okay. When my food arrived and I opened the Styrofoam container, there were some chunks of melted cheese that looked like curds. Kinda grossed me out and I promptly scooped them off. After reheating my food in the microwave, I tried the enchiladas. I didn't like the red sauce at all. Had kind of a smoky flavor that I didn't care for. The chicken wasn't shredded as advertised, but instead diced/chopped. The rice tasted so plain, it might have well been white rice. Was not impressed with the beans either. Very disappointed with this lunch and I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Food does not taste good.  The food is boring and bland.  I regretted eating there the moment I tasted the food.  I will stick with the other Mexican food place down the street which is cheaper and the food tastes better!"}
