{"text":"Excellent Spanish cuisine!  Everything was as authentic as I've ever encountered outside of Spain.  Probably some of the best tapas I've had Stateside.  The meat and cheese plate was made with all imported products and did not disappoint.    The tapas we tried were all delicious and inventive, not to mention beautiful.  Do yourself a favor and order the pasta fresca, which the chef created and is inspired by the flavors of Spain; truly not to be missed.  Also, the albondigas (lamb meatballs) were ridiculously good!  I went with a large party and we shared multiple tapas and a paella.  The paella was exactly as I remember it in Spain!  I feel like I can't find it prepared this well in the States!  I love Spanish wines, and all the wines were imports from Spain.  I tried a Rioja and it was amazing.  I'd like to sample some of the others on their list!  Service was also fantastic.  Attentive but not pushy and our waiter helped navigate us through the menu.    The decor is beautiful (a whole wall decorated with hand-painted Spanish tiles) and classy.  For a new establishment, this place isn't fooling around!  A very welcome addition to the growing Pittsburgh food scene!"}
{"text":"Very authenitic Spanish tapas menu.  Unique dishes, well prepared.  Friendly staff and nice relaxed atmosphere.  A needed addition to Shadyside."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Pretty presentation can't compensate for flavorless food and intrusive wait staff rushing to clear plates."}
{"text":"Excellent tapas place! I have been looking for awhile for somewhere with more than a handful of vegetarian options, and this place delivers. They even made a vegetarian paella, which was not on the menu. The meat-eaters in our group also loved their food. There is a great cocktail and alcohol selection as well. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the service is terrible.  We were there on a Saturday night; it was busy, but not full. The servers seemed overwhelmed.  It took about 15 minutes after we were seated for someone to come and take a drink order, and since this was a new staffer she had to hand us over to someone else because she couldn't answer a question about the wine.  Our server (once we had his attention) was fine  - and eventually, very accommodating - but it took 1 1/2 hours for one of the dishes we ordered to arrive, and another one had been forgotten. They comped that one, which we appreciated after our long wait. Tables that arrived after we did came and went before we even got all of our food.  I  wanted to love this place and give it top marks because everything we had was delicious. but they really need to be better organized.  We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"A small group of us stopped for Happy Hour a month ago and everything we ordered was great!  Wine list  offers a good selection and is reasonably priced.  The Malbec my husband and I shared was delicious.  The Tofu a la Plancha and the Chorizo Flatbread were both fantastic.  We  love all garlic - so the Tofu was perfect.  I was taken aback by how good the tofu dish was.  So seldom do \"non-asian\" \"non-vegetarian\" restaurants get tofu right.  The Patatus Bravas were perfectly spiced with good smokey Spanish Paprika, just the way you would want them to taste at a decent tapas joint.  Octopus dish was well prepared, tender with a nice sauce.  Overall loved the food and will return."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim with my wife on one of the very few days we had child care. We had recently been disappointed by Morcilla, but thought we would give Spanish tapas another try in a different location and were absolutely floored by Pallantia.   The boldness of flavors in every dish was stunning.The meats were perfectly cooked (love the octopus and the lamb in particular). Presentation was beautiful and our waiter knew every dish on the menu and was only too happy to make recommendations. The owner was present and attentive (to the point that he came over to us when I was just admiring the decor because he thought I was looking for our waiter).   There was live music on the Friday night we went and it complimented an already great atmosphere. I could not say enough good things about this place. If you want great Spanish food in Pittsburgh, Pallantia is clearly the best I have had. It compares favorably to the best Spanish food I've had anywhere else in the country. If I had one complaint, it is that the price point is a tad high for what I am used to with Tapas, but if it is what is necessary to keep this place open so I can come back, then so be it!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner at Pallantia on Friday night with friends.  The jazz band playing was a great touch to contribute to the atmosphere.  Our serves was multi-tasking as waiter and saxophonist and did a great job.  He was a lot of fun.  Food was excellent and drinks were very yummy too!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The cocktails are superb, the food is consistently wonderful, the wait staff is friendly, informed and efficient and the atmosphere is cozy. You can spend as much or as little as you like. Definitely my date night go-to!"}
{"text":"This is a far cry from what a Spanish restaurant serving tapas should be. I came here with a group of three others after another place was much too loud. I saw that the price range on Yelp was $$$, but we went anyway. From the outside it looks hip and modern, and that same feel tries to continue inside, but doesn't quite make it. Modern chairs are surrounded by wide landscape pictures of Spain, while the music playing in the background is similar to what a really bad techno club would play. You can't tell who works there and who doesn't, aside from the waiters. That is my biggest pet peeve about restaurants. When we walked in, a man in jeans and a dressy short-sleeved shirt approached us and asked if we wanted a table. His attire made him blend in with the rest of the customers. He sat us right away, but that's to be expected, considering it was about 8:00 by then.   When our waiter came over, he said his recommendation for a group of five was 8-10 tapas. I'm sorry, what?!? 8-10?!?!?! Mind you, have a look at the menu: the prices are sky high. As soon as he left, I said to my group, we're not getting 8-10. Let's do 5. How tapas are supposed to work is you get a bunch of different ones so you have a lot of food on the table, and everyone gets to take a little bit of each! Simple, right?  Except for the fact that the tapas from this place are incredibly small. Tiny. Ridiculously tiny. After spending well over $100, none of us were full. We decided to go to a great local ice cream place, Millie's. Now that place, I would wholeheartedly recommend."}
{"text":"When I saw they were putting in a Tapas restaurant just off of Walnut Street I was thrilled! But, after visiting the establishment my excitement has been tremendously stifled. The service left something to be desired and needed to be asked to bring glasses of water after a couple of visits to the table, as well as a menu, while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. The food was good - but did not warrant the inflated prices. We ordered the Paella which was what I was most looking forward to - it stated \"serves 2-3 people\" on the menu but there were only 3 of each - shrimp, scallops, and mussels - over rice so it did not fill the two of us, in the least, and if we didn't get any of the other tapas we still would've been rather hungry. It hardly served one and they charged $34 for the dish. The drinks were hit and miss and waiter had little to no knowledge of the wine list.   Overall, the food tasted good, the drinks were forgettable, and the restaurant was a disappointment because of an overpriced menu and lacking waitstaff. Not a recommendable experience nor will I be making a return visit."}
{"text":"Not anything spectacular or special.  Hot tapas plates came out on the room temperature bordering on cold.  Okay flavors overall.  Would not recommend or bother going back for seconds.  For price charge in relation to quality of food, it does not add up.  Recommend going to Morcilla in Lawrenceville for 10x better quality and flavors and same price."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant I've ever been to. The foods are so bad. Also, the dishes are so small that you cannot fill yourself even if you spend 80 dollars per person. The service is poor as well, you'll have to wait for 30 min for someone to pick up your bill even if almost no one is in the restaurant. I'll never recommend anyone to come here."}
{"text":"Began dinner with cocktails, out of dark rum at this full bar, ok, so moved to a featured drink, Madrid. Tasty, but when ordering a second...ran out of agave. Boo. Ordered a cheese plate and a meat plate. Out of the speciality pork. Wow, really? Again? Had the grilled octopus, was good, but way too much vinegar. Also had the lamb empanadas. I love most flavors, but this was pure indian, with a very minimal bite of lamb. Way more fried dough than anything else. On the up side, the staff was friendly and the chef greeted the tables and the flan was delish. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent tapas in an airy open space.  Highly recommended: we'll be back. This thoughtful menu is expertly rendered and then properly coursed by the the serving staff. Cocktails were perfect, and complimented the menu nicely. We had Gazpacho (light and delightful!) and Tapas. The Chorizo & Patatas had perfect caramelized onion, and the croquettes (serrano ham and bacalao) had crisp exteriors and fluffy insides perfectly proportioned to let us taste all of the ingredients. Pallantia is an excellent choice for dinner just off of Shadyside's Walnut Street."}
{"text":"Went here tonight to try it and had a wonderful experience. The service and the food were both excellent. Sangria was tasty, the cheese board had lots of tasty items, and the pasta Fresca and veal stew were both very delicious. We had the leche Fritas for dessert and this was also quite good. Will definitely be back to this place again."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! We got a few apps and the big meat platter. Three of us, including my Dad who could clean out an entire fridge of food, were full. The drink selection was good too.  Service was great, and the space was pretty! I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The food was amazing !!!    We had 8 plates and 2 desserts and all 10 dishes were awesome !!!  This is one talented and creative chef  !!!   Also had great Spanish wines !!!   The only negative was the band on a Friday night  We came in for a peaceful dinner and had to listen to a band, although they were good , they did not fit the vibe of the restaurant.  The Latin fusion music that was playing during their break  was a perfect fit for the place.  We will be back based on the incredible food but only on a night without a band !!!!"}
{"text":"If you have the time, try the paella. It's really good."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places I have eaten in Pittsburgh! Stumbled upon this restaurant after an event in East Liberty. So many healthy and fresh items to choose from. Conner was our server and was extremely attentive and provided guidance on food selection.  We had the Watermelon Salad, Octopus, Seared Skirt Steak, goat tongue empanadas, and Shrimp. All were fabulous with super fresh ingredients. We will definitely be back and spreading the word about this fine eatery!"}
{"text":"Sangria and rosé wine, ibéricos, yellow tomato gazpacho, potato omelet, mushrooms and shrimp ... yum, yum, yum!!! Well-deserved indulgence after a day of walking CMU's campus, Pitt's campus and the Cathedral of Learning. Then touring Randyland, City of Asylum & Bicycle Heaven!  This place was great! Easy to get a reservation! And 6 tapas and 3 drinks came to $100 -- not bad! They were understaffed the night we went, so service was slow. But we weren't in a hurry, so no problem-o!"}
{"text":"It is a relative rarity to find a spanish restaurant that advertises that they make gluten free paella.   For this reason and this reason alone I was super excited to visit this establishment.  It was an added bonus that upon perusal of their website that there appeared to be a gluten free menu.  So with these two facts safely in my minds eye, we set off for Pallantia Tapas de Espana.  In fact we even made reservations on open table as it was a saturday evening.  We got there to find only a handful of guests and basically our pick of seats ( we choose to sit under the large bull).  As mentioned in other reviews, it was an eclectic bunch of people and thus perfect for really any kind of scene and yet no scene at all.   When the waitress presented herself, I inquired after a gluten free menu, to which she said that as their menu changes rather often it was decided that the gluten free menu be discontinued.  That being said there were still many options so long as you dont choose anything that has touched a fryer.   That was rather a bummer because I really REALLY wanted the patatas bravas.  Anyway, we ordered and got the paella marinera and tried to get the churrasco.  When the waitress came back she had a huge \"jk\" moment and let us know that actually they did have a dedicated gluten free fryer sooo patatas bravas were back on the menu but that they had run out of the churrasco.  Ok so we decided to get the \"baby Parillada,\"  the paella annnnnd the bravas.  Well let me tell you, the amount of left overs that I brought home was colossal. The bravas were cut into huge pieces that were a bit unwieldy; however, they were cooked to perfection and had a wonderful only slightly spicy sauce.  The baby parillada was anything but small.... it was on a huge wooden slab and the meat was very tender.  Also, the morcilla that came with the parillada was smokey sweet and reminded me of home.  To top off this adventure was the seafood paella.  The rice was on the cusp of being overcooked; however, the scallops contained within were out of this world.  They were buttery, soft and just melted in your mouth.    Overall, not too busy, dedicated gluten free fryer (but 100% double check), great food with enormous portions and pretty good ambiance.  Great for date night or a nice conversation :D  Enjoy, I know I'll be back whenever the paella hankering hits me."}
{"text":"My friends told me the Marinera is really good, I tried one and found very salty, but my friend said it's okay. In the end we found why. Half of the rice is VERY red but the other is totally white. Clearly the cook put all the sauce in one side. A very negative experience!"}
{"text":"We made an early reservation on a Saturday night to take my parents out.  What a find!  We found close and easy parking, walked in and were promptly seated.  The restaurant is a beautiful place, clean, plenty of room, relatively quiet and very kid friendly. It has an intriguing Spanish decor, subtle but clear.  The food was completely authentic and very well done.  Great tapas, unique and delicious salad, and very tasty main choices.  Jim, our waiter, did a great job helping us with the menu, adjusting to our updates and the kitchen and generally making us feel right at home.  Definitely a favorite!"}
{"text":"This is a tough one to write. Apparently its fine to go here during the week. But come the weekend the entire operation falls apart. And when I mean fall apart, I mean fall apart.   Despite having had a reservation and being seated promptly, we sat and sat and sat and sat before someone attended to us. Eventually we got service and ultimately drinks (although that was like pulling teeth). Once we got drinks, however, getting food was nearly impossible.   Apparently the head chef was off doing a private event or something, and the sous chef was in charge. Things did not go well. I watched the servers become more and more frenzied as the night went on. Apologies abounded. Free wine was provided (nice!). But still no food. When the food came, it was good, but I was ready to chew my arm off at that point, so pretty much anything would have been fantastic to me. The night culminated with our server quitting on the spot. The drama!  Apparently this type of chaos ensues every Saturday night. Which I find spectacularly insane. It has something to do with the inability to staff the restaurant appropriately to handle the weekend rush (which mysteriously, other restaurants manage to figure out). Moral to the story- come here on weeknight or very early. If you want anything less than a 3 hour ordeal of fasting, frenzied staff, and overall chaos, go somewhere else on Saturday nights."}

{"text":"The only reason there isnt 5 stars here is I have experienced GREAT tapas across the nation and well, I am ruined. Bob the bartender was Awesome because he appreciated core cocktail craftsmanship. Great bourbon negronis and the manhattan was simple and delicious!  I had the goat cheese appy which was awesome.  I had the crab tapas but didn't expect it to be in a deep fried state and frankly the flavor wasn't very exciting so I can't give that a recommendation.  I want to try more but got full. I am intrigued!  I will be back as Pittsburgh needs more small bites experiences like this with friendly staff like Rose and Bob.     Thank you for being here Pallantia!"}
{"text":"I Went here for dinner while visiting the city this past weekend. I'm a picky eater, and I have to be honest. I'm impressed! Our table shared the meat platter, and the cheese plater-soooo good! We also shared the seafood paella, amazing! We finished the night with the deconstructed s'more- it's a must eat.  Overall-5 stars. They were very busy, and the service was a little slow but the waitstaff was courtrooms and attentive. I will definitely go back next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Pallantia is one of our favorite restaurants in Shadyside so you will find us there often.  As a Spaniard, I can vouch for the  authenticity of the Spanish flavor of their dishes.  The ingredients come from local farms and the quality and freshness  is obvious in the flavor.  Its hard to pick a favorite dish.  There are so many and the menu is updated frequently.    We often show up without a reservation and grab dinner at the bar.  Rico  makes the best drinks and he is great at going over the menu and all the new dishes.  Connor is our favorite waiter.  He knows just how to take care of you.  We did the Chef's Table with our friends on our last visit.  What an amazing evening!  The food was fabulous and watching the kitchen in action was incredible.  Getting to know Juan Gonzalez, Executive Chef, on a more personal basis (about his life, his passion for food, his family) was such a treat.  Whether you eat at a table, at the bar, or do the Chef's Table in the kitchen, alone or with a group, you will be glad you went to Pallantia."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to eat at this place on a visit back to my home town adjacent to my favorite street in Pittsburgh: Walnut street.  Amazing, authentic, delicious Spanish tapas with the freshest ingredients available. Cocktails were exceptional.  The ambiance and atmosphere were great.  Service was superb.  What more could one ask for."}
{"text":"Really fun place!  The tapas were delicious - in particular I loved the peppers.  Cocktails unique and amazing!  A little pricey, but the food was good & I actually feel like I ate something (unlike other tapas restaurants I've been to)."}
{"text":"Probably the best Spanish and sea food in town! Awesome paella, great wine selection. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this restaurant.  Brought my Spanish husband and father-in-law, worried about them being disappointed. Far from it!  Wonderful wine selection, though small, was delightful every sip. We tried the Albariño, Cava and Ribera del Duero. Tapas so good you don't want to share but that's what it's about. Luckily your table mates have to share, too. Try the octopus, calamari, and croquetas. I had gazpacho, perfect!  My guys loved the paella, couldn't get enough. Met the owner, he was most gracious. The space is well decorated and comfortable. Staff is friendly and efficient. Not one bad thing to say. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has best paella I have had in Pittsburgh. Yummy!  It is worth to wait for 30 minutes."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there on a date night. We had the Tabla de Ibéricos and the Sandía y Serrano salad. Both were excellent. We also ordered paella, but after waiting for over an hour for it, we were pretty disappointed. The seafood was scarce and it had a strange mushy texture, like the seafood that comes in a can. The only thing that seemed fresh was the mussels. Also, it was very salty. Obviously, we won't come back for paella again, but we might for the tapas we didn't get to try."}
{"text":"What a fantastic restaurant!  Just reviewing the menu with Connor's help made our tastebuds get ready for delicious perfection.  And the meal satisfied the desire.....  The entire meal was wonderful and tasty.  The paella was out of this world delicious!!   Connor was welcoming, provided lots of information about the menu, and made us feel like we were going to have the best time .... muy apreciado  Mas, por favor.. incredible.. y fantastico !!  muchas gracias.. olvido pronto!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Service nice.  Nothing outstanding.  Sangria was the highlight of the evening. Tapas dishes all came out at once.  Not good. Potatoes.  Calamari and Chicken empanadas will leave no lasting memories."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Saturday night. The food was good, but not great - Nothing was terrible, but nothing was mind-blowing, either. I was most excited for the paella, and found it to be overly pricey for what we got, especially because the clams in the paella were sandy/gritty and were not washed properly. The cocktails were really good - The presentation of the Manhattan impressed our group, the Barca is great if you like gin, and the sangria was honestly one of the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Our server was attentive and pleasant. I am giving the restaurant 3 stars because of the food, but I would give the server and cocktails 5 stars. I would recommend sitting at the bar and having a few cocktails, but would not recommend trying to impress your foodie friends with a full dinner at this place."}
{"text":"After circling Walnut, we finally decided to park the car where we started and try Pallantia on a Friday night around 8:00PM.  When we arrived, the waitress asked if we had a reservation (so you can make one!) but it wasn't necessary as we had our choice of almost any table.  There were a few groups of people of varying age groups.  The atmosphere in Pallantia is definitely laidback, dim for intimate conversations.  There's also a bar if you're just interested in grabbing drinks and relaxing while watching a game or whatever's on.  I'm not a seafood eater, but my boyfriend is and I thought his eyes were going to pop out of his head.  We ordered the Patatas Bravas, Croquetas de Jamon, and Albondigas.  Both the Patatas and Croquetas were phenomenal, I was a little let down by the Albondigas and would suggest ordering something else.  Of course, I couldn't admit I loved the Croquetas because my boyfriend wanted to shout \"I told you so!\" after I gave him a hard time for ordering them.  My boyfriend also ordered the Pasta Fresca (clams, so I didn't try it), but we both agreed the tapas were the reason to come to Pallantia."}
{"text":"They have a fixed 5-course menu for Valentine's day for $85 and you can't order otherwise. Not really worth it. Especially the dessert. Besides it's kind of noisy."}
{"text":"We went the tapas route in our ordering, and every dish was very good.  We liked all aspects of our evening except that the background music was loud.  The tapas are small plates, which we find a great way to put together an interesting meal.  Each of us ordered two tapas, then shared the cheese plate instead of dessert.  For those who want a more conventional larger entree, the paella is reputed to be outstanding.  Be aware that there is live music a couple of nights each week.  We avoided those nights (Wednesday and Friday, I think)."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with Pallantia. A friend recommended we check it out on a Friday night, so I made a reservation for our small group of four. Turns out the reservation wasn't needed because the place was pretty dead - I'm not sure why because our experience was great!  Our server (Connor) was very helpful and knowledgeable. He suggested some menu items based on our general likes and dislikes. I can't remember everything that we had.... I know there were patatas bravas, octopus, shrimp, a ribeye, and a selection of meats. We also had some desserts - a bread pudding and flan.   The food was all beautifully presented and I did enjoy everything that we sampled. The chef also came out later in the evening to chat with us and discuss the menu, so that was a nice touch.  I am not someone who generally eats a ton of tapas.... I always feel like the ratios of food are off and it ends up being sooo pricey. However I thought our server did a really nice job of helping us select our food and I'll keep this spot in mind if I'm craving tapas in the future!"}
{"text":"Their tapas were done carefully and with selected ingredients (we had tomate salad with prosciuto, a toast with shrimps and and omelet with mushrooms).  We also had Sea Food Paella. We could see they use the best ingredients ever (Fresh, Big Size, Good Quality), but it taste too salty and strong. The rice should be more dry, because it put in the oven, but it was like \"porridge\". For $45 (only the Paella), we were expecting more for the taste quality. We went in a Sunday at lunch time, there was only one server, he was really really nice, but the service was very slow."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend with my family very excited to try a tapas place I. Pittsburgh.  Unfortunately I was underwhelmed. The atmosphere looks like it used to be a bar in south side with some pictures of Spain and a sword on the wall. Then came the food. Our waitress recommended at least 1 tapas per person if we were gonna get the paella so we did.  We started with the meat and cheese plate. Both of which were fine but nothing special. Next we had the seared shrimp which was very bland. They then brought out our paella before bringing our other appetizers. The paella was good but again nothing special. Then our other appetizers came. The empanadas were tasty and I would recommend them. Then came the pork belly which was good but came out in the size of a filet and they didn't give us any silverware to cut it and serve to each other. Lastly we're the croquettes which we're really good but we were too full by that time from the paella to really enjoy them. Overall decent food that is overpriced. If you're looking for good small plates go to Morcilla. The drinks, food, and service are much better"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner this week after not dining here since their soft opening. I was sad that they had gotten rid of two excellent menu items-- the grilled octopus/fish tapas and the gazpacho Bloody Mary. We got the calamari ($11) and the paella ($42) to share for 2 people, both were very good but not as mind-blowing as my first meal here. I remembered the paella being more crispy on the bottom the first time, this time it was more moist which I didn't like as much. It was still really good thought.   I'll be back to try more menu items and hope I discover something as good as that octopus and hat Bloody Mary, would love it if they brought them back! That would definitely earn my fifth star!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night for dinner. Pallantia look quite small on the outside but the inside was pretty spacious. The restaurant was pretty much dead on the Sunday night. There were less than 10 people dining in the restaurant.   The decors here are okay, nothing outstanding or memorable. The host and waiter were nice and welcoming. I enjoyed the service.   I came for the paella so that's what I ordered. The paella took about 30 minutes to be made which is reasonable. When it came out, the waiter told us to be careful because it was hot. Turned out, the dish was not hot at all, it was actually quite cold for something that has just been made. I have had paella at other places before and the one here was definitely not the best I have had.  There was not enough seafood for the premium cost and something that should be shared between 2-3 people. The rice was also way too salty for me and my sister, and both of us love salty food. We had to squeeze lime on the dish to make it less salty. The seafood that was used did not taste very fresh neither. Overall, a disappointing paella experience.   We decided to order the flan and bread pudding for desserts. The flan was very dense and tasted almost like cheesecake. It was actually served with goat cheese. The flan was topped with some roasted nuts (I think pistachio) and the topping tasted really good. I have never had flan this style but it did taste yummy. The bread pudding was okay and was actually not dense enough. The amount of raisins inside the bread pudding was very overwhelming.   Overall, not sure if I would come back here. There are definitely better options in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Authentic tapas, served up with delightful and comfortable ambiance, along with excellent service.  The menu and ingredients were so authentic, we felt we were in Spain. I enjoyed the wine list, particularly a nice Cava starting at $10 a glass.   Our party of 8 was graciously seated together. We enjoyed a wonderful cheeseboard of Drunken Goat, Mahon, Manchego, and Valdeon.  The menu advises a 25 minute wait for Paella, which is a reasonably standard concession.  The Paella was delicious and did not disappoint.   I was able to taste several other menu items, such as a very nice marinated mushroom dish and the gazpacho.  Our waiter offered to split our check, which we gratefully accepted.   It was a delightful evening of food and discussion, Pallantia is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really surprised to find this amazing place a couple blocks away from our Pittsburgh lodgings during a brief two day visit. It's really a two-for-one here; an amazing craft cocktail lounge and excellent tapas restaurant (yes, they also have paella but we didn't sample that aspect of the menu).  Monkfish, gambas, padrone peppers, lamb albondigas, and garbanzo salad were all absolutely perfect, but in reality it was Stern's amazing cocktails that brought us back for a second night. His \"Dulcinea\" take on the Manhattan is going in our book as an absolute favorite. Very nice all-spanish wine list going on as well. Great service from all involved here, including owner who took a personal interest in diner's experiences."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight was a pleasant surprise. The restaurant had a legitimate Spanish feel, but not the intricate details you would see in Spain. The lone greeter/bartender/server was nearly overwhelmed, but actually handled the situation well, much better than should have been expected. The food and drinks were excellent. We shared asparagus, lamb sliders, potatoes, and fried cheese tapas. With the Spanish red wine there was no room for desert. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience!  We celebrated Valentines a few days early. The wine was very good and not overpriced. We shared the meat and cheese boards and the seafood paella.  All the seafood was cooked to perfection. Go and support this great local business! Go now!"}
{"text":"Well at first I did not think I would like this place.  The beer selection was not good.  But the food was amazing.  The lamb sausage was the best.  The chef came out and greeted us.  It was a great experience and wonderful staff.  Awesome place."}
{"text":"My parents and I went here last Saturday night while I was visiting Pittsburgh, and it was such a delightful evening! Our table was in this little alcove, and we were immediately welcomed by the owner who was kind and engaging. Various staff stopped by throughout the evening to chat, talk about the food, give tastes of various drinks, and such. A really beautiful and magical evening. Many thanks!"}
{"text":"There was no a/c. It was burning hot inside and their service was so slow that they didn't even bring ice/water to compensate for lack of a/c. Food was salty and overpriced. Definitely one of the worst Spanish food experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"I walk past Pallantia almost every day and saw it going up and noticed a soft opening the week before.  There were eight of us who went, four adults four kids.  We enjoyed a broad selection of small plates (tapas) as well as paella, and a bottle of white wine.    What I enjoyed most about the food was the fact that the food was authentic in terms of ingredients and preparation (many of the cured meats and cheeses are sourced directly from Spain).  In addition the presentation of the small plates was truly artistic and beautiful.    Nothing here is over worked or processed.  The food is simple, elegant and gorgeous.    This is a very welcome addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene and my sense is that the overall experience will only get better as they get a little experience under their belt.    My one suggestion to the team is that when the tapas come out, a little bit of exposition about what is coming out would be very helpful.  For example if there is a specially source Jamon, it would be good to know a little about it.  On the cheese and cured meats plate, it would be helpful to have each of the meats named and discussed and the names and origins of the cheeses would be helpful as well.  Otherwise, good luck to Pallantia.  We are all very happy you are here."}
{"text":"Yes, the shrimp was good, the calamari was good, the pasta was good, the flank steak was good, the lamb chop was good. But the paella was great, superb, excellent! Get whatever tapas dish you want. And then get the paella."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pallantia for dinner for quite a while and love it every time, food, music, wine and the staff. Now I just tried Sunday brunch there for the first time and it was fantastic. Forgot the names of the things we ordered, but they were delicious. Few options, almost all with eggs, and some delicious oysters. Don't remember if they have veg/vegan options, but the baked eggs with chorizo, beans, and tomato sauce were just delicious, probably the best brunch I've had in Shadyside."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town from DC with our 2 month old and decided to give this place a try based on the many positive reviews and my wife's craving for paella.   We appreciated how welcoming the staff was even though we had our baby (she was great btw, barely a peep the whole 1.5 hours we were there).  We had the Sangria, which was good - not overly sweet like others we have tried.   We got the cheese and meat platter, the grilled octopus, the duck, and the paella. We finished our dinner with the fried chocolate milk dessert.   My impression after having the entrees was that the octopus, duck, and seafood in the paella were delicious and seasoned very well. I would go back again for the octopus alone - the texture was tender, and it went so well with the ink aioli and fresh squeezed lime juice.   The duck was seasoned and cooked well (med) and still had crispy skin. I didn't care for the quinoa, but that's just me.   The cheese and meat platter included a great variety of things to enjoy and won't ruin your appetite if you plan on ordering other dishes.   While we really enjoyed the seafood, sausage, and snow pea shoot garnish (which was also seasoned well with olive oil and salt) in the paella, my wife and I were disappointed in the lack of seasoning in the rice itself, and the almost complete lack of crispy rice (socarrat) in the bottom of the pan.   Dessert was interesting, but probably not something I would order again.   Service was good after a long wait between ordering the Sangria and ordering our food.   If there is a next time, we will order the Sangria again, and then feast on the small dishes and pass on the paella and dessert."}
{"text":"I make it a point to try out all Pittsburgh tapas.  What's not to love when there's wine, cheese, jamon, and tapas?  Pallantia Tapas de España has a modern feel to it, very different from many Tapas place around town.  My honest review would put the food at 3.5, but service bumps it up to a 4.  The bartender and server who helped me were very personable.  This place is definitely on top of my list if I am in the neighborhood.  The whipped cheese was delicious with the toasted flatbread.  The meat plate was decent, but the sausages were pretty much falling apart.  The seafood paella has a ton of clams, shrimps, and mussels.  However, it didn't have enough flavor.  I'm told they have a great selection of imported wine and have started a happy hour.  That will likely be my next visit!"}
{"text":"This restaurant recently relocated from Greensburg to Shadyside and is a very welcome addition to the growing culinary scene in the burgh.  Everything here was impeccable- the service, the food, the drinks leave nothing to complain about.  We stuck with the tapas and did not try out the paella (too many delectable sounding tapas to commit to one large entree), but we will most definitely be back to try more.  The wine list was small, but the options offered were more than adequate. And $32 for a decent bottle of wine in a restaurant doesn't leave the wallet feeling too sad.  Every bite of food we savored was delicious, from the crispy Bronzino and octopus to the succulent garlic shrimp. Some items are imported directly from Spain and others are perfected in-house, but either way all are bursting with flavor and prepared with expertise.  My only advice would be to order the tapas as you go, I am pretty sure our waiter advised us to do so but I was so excited I missed those instructions and we ended up with 8 plates on our table at once.  Short of a plane ticket to Spain itself this place is the next best thing!"}
{"text":"This place has hands down the most delicious tapas in the Shadyside area and its surroundings, if not all of Pittsburgh. Every single dish is different and tasty in its own special way. The ingredients are unique, the flavors are authentic, exotic, and fresh, and the presentation is BEAUTIFUL. Everything was just incredibly flavorful... I enjoyed every bite. And the cocktails are on point!!! The pictures I took speak for themselves. The service was excellent, the waitress checked on us regularly, filled our drinks, asked if everything was okay, and gave excellent recommendations for cocktails. We were definitely very well taken care of and beyond satisfied. All in all, I LOVE this place and I highly recommend it!!! My favorite dishes are the lamb meatballs and the calamari, but everything I tasted was yummy. Its definitely the hottest place on the block!!"}
{"text":"Another new discovery hidden in the lovely Ivy street off Walnut, this is a great place to try some Spanish tapas with a glass of wine. The soft lighting  makes this a great spot for date night. We ordered the cheese and meat tapas and it came with a good selection of cheese, olives, and jam with good portions for two people. We also ordered the lentil soup and the combination of all above was enough for the both of us. There are two TVs at the bar showing soccer which adds a fun casual vibe to what otherwise could be an upscale tapas restaurant. Definitely worth checking out and next time we'll try a few more of the dishes since we only realized after we placed the order that there was a back side to the menu!"}
{"text":"Went for the paella. They have one type and confess that they are still working on it.  For two of us we had three tapas and the paella and that was about the right amount of food.  Tapas were excellent but I would rate the paella better than average.  Only subpar part was the gazpacho sangria that was  underwhelming-- mostly ice.  Our server seemed very eager-- was at the table every few minutes.  Overall a nice addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Food was expensive and not impressive. We had to order 3 wines before finding one they had in stock. Place was pretty empty on a Friday night which was a little odd, I missed the hustle and feel of a packed place. Server was fine, but not very helpful when we had questions about the menu. Meal was very slow as well, we order drinks and split tapas for two and it took over 2 hours."}
{"text":"Thought food was a little better than average with big flavors. Two of us shared cod, pasta, steak and ribs plates. All were well prepared with the exception of the lump of pasta. Skipped desert and left unfulfilled. My largest issue is with the prices relative to food served. Very very pricey for Pittsburgh. Was a bit put off by charging for a small piece of bread. For an equivalent meal I would place the costs at 2 to 2 1/2 times the price of Lidia's as a Pittsburgh comparison. Nothing bad , nothing great"}
{"text":"This place is a must try! All their tapas are delicious and they change up the menu every few weeks with different specials. The staff is very knowledgeable about the menu and are super friendly. One of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"We just went to Spain in November and have been missing it so finding this restaurant put a smile on our faces! We tried several tapas items and they were all delicious. The plate of meats really hit the spot with the peppery cured ham and the croquettes were exactly what I needed! The atmosphere is great! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Really good paella! Patatas bravas was on point! Bar tender knows his way around a cocktail! Will definitely be back!  Heads up though, if you want the paella, you should come early. Overheard it being 86'd at about 7:15 pm."}
{"text":"I really like the paella! And the fried milk was delicious. I don't remember its name."}
{"text":"A 5 is tough to give out and was really between it and a 4.5.  Here is why I went with the all-elusive 5 rating.  For some background, I have been all over Spain as well as to Portugal...so the bar was pretty high for Spanish food in Pittsburgh.  First, we ended up going there for an early dinner and lucked out getting reservations online for the time we wanted (everything after it was booked).  We ordered multiple tapas, paella, and a round of sangria....and we were not disappointed.    Sangria (4.5/5) -- The sangria was very good.  Not 100% authentic to the ones in Spain, but still excellent.  Seems like they use a sweeter red or more sugar than their counterparts abroad.  Patatas Bravas (5/5) -- So no joke, these possibly were the best patatas bravas I have ever had.  Perfectly crispy potatoes with a great garlic aioli on top and the spicy tomato sauce on the bottom.  Only place I think I have had them were they were comparable and on par was at Platea in Madrid.  Churrasco Con Papas (4.3/5) -- Openly going to admit I didnt eat much beef while on the Iberian Peninsula in any of my trips.  The skirt steak was perfect cooked medium, sliced super thin.  The chimichurri was ok, but just a tad too much of a vinegar note.  Let me note though that at least one other person in our group thought it was the best dish.  Calamar a la Romana (4.8/5) -- Tough to go wrong with fried calamari, but the quality of ingredients were evident.  Great batter.  Great calamari.  Where Pallantia hits a home run is with their spicy paprika aioli.  Good lord, bottle that up!  So paella always takes a long time to cook and I believe the menu actually says to allow for 25 mins (which is actually on the low end of preparation/cook time from places I have been).  With the tapas already enjoyed, we were simply enjoying relaxing between the two courses.  The paella took a little longer than I think the staff expected (maybe 40 mins total time), but the staff brought out two tapas on the house without us complaining or even mentioning a word....and I am grateful they did as the two tapas they brought were delicious.  Croquetas de Serrano (4.8/5) -- Can never go wrong with fried croquettes filled with Spanish ham.  Perfectly crunchy exterior and completely soft interior.  Smoky goodness.  They put it on top of their paprika aioli, which as I said earlier and will say again.....bottle that stuff up as it is gold!  Whipped Goat Cheese (4.7/5) --  So simple, yet so delicious.  Served with some grilled baguette.  One person from our group was eating the remaining cheese from the serving dish once the bread was gone.  Then comes the paella, which I would give a 4.5.  It was really good with mussels, clams, and shrimp sitting on top and then divers scallops and calamari mixed in with the rice. Was cooked perfectly.  Reason why I docked it some points is I have had some amazing paellas in Barcelona with some different seafood combinations that just blew my mind.  Definitely dont get me wrong, I would still recommend the paella at Pallantia without a doubt.  Finding good, close to authentic Spanish is not something you expect to find in Pittsburgh.  I still need to try Morcilla (been to Mallorca, which is decent but not overly impressed), but it will be tough to make that decision when feeling hungry for Spanish food knowing Pallantia is right up in Shadyside."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. They at least have some nice Spanish wines.  If you really are in the market to pay more than the food is worth, check this place out."}
{"text":"No.  My girlfriend and I stayed for 1 hour. In that hour, we ordered a beer and 4 dishes, one of which actually came to our table. The restraunt was severely understaffed and menu it felt like half the menu was unavailable. I never write reviews but I just had to say something about this place. If you want authentic Spanish in Pittsburgh food there are tons of alternatives.  Ill say one thing to the restaurant managers: Get your $h!t together. Gather it up, put it all in one place so it's together. I won't be coming back but hey, thanks for the $9 salad."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Shadyside! ! Our waitress, Danielle, was extremely knowledgeable in describing every dish on the menu.Chef Nathan's savoring dishes were artistic and favorable. OUR FIRST EXPERIENCE of Spanish cuisine was memorable and satisfying. We started with a cold tapas frosted baby carrots, celery, fennel, manzanilla olives and spiced almonds.So much flavor! Another mouth-watering tapas was the hamburger sliders with manchego , Serrano ham, Socorro aioli and chips.Both entrees were so exceptional and the paella topped the evening! Can 't wait to go back and try the other tapas on the menu.We now love Spanish food."}
{"text":"Meh.  A tapas bar without sherry isn't a tapas bar.  I agree with the reviewer who said the food was flavorless and expensive."}
{"text":"We ordered the parrillada (the star of the show), chicken empanadas, shrimp, and a cheese plate. Everything was wonderful - we just needed a bit more guidance with the ordering process. Learned that tapas should be ordered as you go. Don't order everything all at once. Also, the sangria was delicious, and not too sweet. We had two pitchers between the three of us."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here a few months ago and we found the food to be excellent.  We ordered the tapas - cheese board, shrimp, and cauliflower dish were the ones I had that night along with a bottle of wine.  Atmosphere was nice, good service, and the food was delicious. Give this place a try if you like small plates with lots of flavor."}
{"text":"Every time we return, something new and enjoyable.   The food is delicious, the atmosphere relaxing and considering the owner is from Spain, truly authentic Tapas and Paella. All we can suggest is to give Pallantia a try. You'll enjoy the night out and think about planning a trip to Spain!"}
{"text":"A terrible dining experience. The meat and cheese plate was ok. The paella was burnt and flavorless. The whole fish was mediocre and I got a fish bond stuck in my throat. Service was terrible. Our waiter forgot about our dessert for 30 min while he was playing with the band and still charged us. It seemed the entire wait staff was mostly standing around behind the bar. Water was never refilled. Dessert was glorified chocolate pudding with Fluff. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Tapas were amazing, definitely comparable to Barcelona ones. I am very happy we have now Authentic Spanish restaurant in Pittsburgh since I am not a fan of Mallorca. The one star I took away is for design, this place is very plain, I'd like to have more coziness"}
{"text":"GIVE ME ALL THE TAPAS.  The food here was amazing. Small plates range from $7-$26 and everything my table tried was fantastic. I don't remember what things were called but I'll do my best to describe! There was the goat cheese with toasted bread. It was super creamy and generous portions. If you like the stinky cheeses/goat cheese, definitely give this a try!   We also had mushrooms which were deliciously vinegary along with delicious steak with potatoes and a chimichurri sauce (new on the menu!) and empanadas (savory with some heat).  We left completely satiated especially after finishing our meal with their deliciously rich flan. Holy wow. Now, I want to go back and try everything else on the menu!  Had to knock off a star because service was pretty spotty...which was odd given that the restaurant wasn't crowded whatsoever."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, excellence quality food and true typical Spanish. Extremely recommended. Nice service"}
{"text":"A little taste of Spain in Pittsburgh's Shady Side neighborhood. Tapas were very traditional and authentic and they have fantastic Spanish wines to pair with these delectable small plates. Decor and atmosphere will transport you to the heart of Spain. Don't expect to see a Steelers or Pirates game here, but rather European soccer and rugby televised at the bar. Service was impeccable and kudos to Gonzalo for delighting us with his family recipes!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and seeing 5-Star and 2-Star ratings, I was curious as to why the wide gap. From the taste of the food, its presentation, friendly efficient service (no dish was discussed unless we asked a question), the experience was perfect. Even the wine recommendation was spot on. From the Gambas Al Ajillo to the Bistec to the Champinones and more, each dish was wonderful. Just back from two trips (Montreal, Miami) Pallantia far surpassed the other meals -- not that I wasn't happy with my meals while traveling. I try not to complain -- I am always grateful that I am able to go out to dinner and experience a meal prepared for me -- but this meal was extra special. We look forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"I went there in the beginning of April for my friend's birthday with another five people or so. The waitress was nice and courteous, and the appetizers were okay. However the paella was one of the worst ones I have had... The rice was very moisty, too sour, and the whole dish felt a bit undercooked. The other sharable meat platter was also not very flattering. Probably would never go there again, as I am sure there are much better options for similar foods in Pittsburgh :("}
{"text":"The one star is for the meat plate... which was fine. Had my boyfriend and I left after that plate, this experience would have been... fine.   We did not try any of the tapas plates and dug right into the paella, after our server assured us it would be more than enough for the 2 of us. Honestly guys, my bf and I are not big eaters. We weren't expecting or wanting to leave stuffed. But we paid $34 for a plate of glue-y rice with a handful of shellfish in it. And it wasn't that good. I didn't want more of it. But I did want the scallops or shrimps we paid for, rather than the 2 we got. They advertise this dish for up to 3 people, so I'm not sure what kind of math they're using but if you've ever fed 3 adult humans, you'd have to know this doesn't cut it.   Unfortunately, they were just as stingy with the wine pours, I've worked in the service industry long enough to know what a 5oz pour looks like. My $13 glass came with about 2.5. Guys. WHAT? Did you run out?   Perhaps if the bartender hadn't been so busy keeping his fedora on straight and throwing his coworkers under the bus (halfway into my BF's Bloody Mary, this guy came over to let us know the girl who made the drink had done it wrong, and there was supposed to be another pepper in it. The BF had no complaints about the drink and this interaction seemed really petty, unnecessary and made us feel like we were in the middle of a sibling quarrel)  Really glad we didn't order more, and know now to avoid this place at all costs. In all, we paid 100 bucks for a decent meat plate, a sip of wine, a pepper-less bloody mary and some grainy gut sludge that smelled like fish. Hoping the next restaurant to take this space has something better to offer."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. Note: this place has a serious cocktail and wine menu in addition to authentic and varied Spanish cuisine. Good for dinner or just drinks on a night out.   I highly recommend the paella--some of the best I've had in recent memory. Perfectly fluffy rice and great flavor. Normally I would not go for hamburger at a place like this, but we did try the hamburguesita (both beef and lamb) at the host's suggestion, and they were awesome. We also enjoyed a nice, simple shrimp dish season with little pepper and garlic. For dessert it was a delicious saffron ice cream.  The service was welcoming and attentive. We came on a Tuesday night with a group of four and were seated promptly, even though there was a good size crowd for a weekday. Great ambience. Looking forward to coming back to try the brunch menu."}
{"text":"I came to Pallatina with a friend for my birthday. We ordered about 7 different dishes (including one of my favorites--patatas bravas) and split them. All of the dishes were pretty good across the board. The croquettes were yummy, just a tiny bit dry, but the sauce made up for it. The patatas bravas continued to be a crowd-pleaser.  Service was good, though the restaurant was pretty empty at 5pm on a Saturday. However, we were satisfied with our visit."}
{"text":"My aunt and me went here for her birthday today to start out we ordered the cheese plate which was very good the goat cheese was delicious so creamy. The only thing that neither of us were fond of was that the bread that came with the cheese plate had tomatoes spread on it. I got the sangria which was good and I'm usually not a big fan of sangria with red wine but I liked it. We just ordered tapas we got the queso frito and the garlic shrimp they were both very good. The service was very good I definitely recommend this place it's a nice date night place to have a couple drinks and some tapas."}
{"text":"A quiet and cozy place around the busy streets of Walnut. We ordered the potatoes, grilled shrimp, and pork belly.  POTATO HEAVEN YALL. The garlic aioli was on point.  Shrimp was buttery and fresh. We order the caramel flan for desert and it had some goat cheese! It was an interesting combo, maybe not my favorite but something different."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place! High marks for food and value. Front of restaurant (bar area) has nice ambiance, back is lacking a bit. Service has always been friendly if not entirely consistent. Would (and have) definitely come back."}
{"text":"Every dish was delicious. The service Impeccable. I ordered Ensalada de Invierno, Frutos Secos y Aceitunas, chuletta de Cordero & pasta Fresca   All of these were full of flavors that stayed on your palate after you ate. Finished with a creme brûlée served with garnish & granola."}
{"text":"We ordered fried calamari, shrimp, toasted mushroom and seafood rice. Can't be better!"}
{"text":"There were little to no redeeming qualities about my experience here.  I called at 5pm for a table. They said they had no open reservations. They called back and said they could fit us in. When we arrived, the place was empty.   The hostess sat us and reviewed the food and drink menus. Knowing what we wanted to drink, we started to order but she said she couldn't help us. I'm not sure why, as it wasn't very busy. Aren't hostesses supposed to get you started when you are first seated? It just seemed a little abrupt.   It took a good 10 minutes for our waitress to even come say hi. She knew nothing about the wine menu and didn't offer any food suggestions. Luckily, we had already decided, since it took 30 minutes between sitting and eating.  The first two dishes were decent all-in-all; however, the ensalada de berza was mostly greens, skimpy on the other ingredients, and drenched in dressing - and the gambas al ajillo were little more than just shrimp on a plate.  Our next two dishes were 50/50, at best: the patatas bravas were perfectly fried (we did love these) - but the duck dish was horrifyingly disgusting. The duck wasn't even what you would call rare, more like raw, so the fat wasn't rendered at all, and the entire place of meat was cold and chewy. The sauce was gross, tasted like mayo, and created a very weird texture with the frisee. Honestly, the combo made my stomach turn.  I'm not sure why, at this point, we felt the need to order dessert - maybe we were still hopeful. We waited THIRTY MINUTES for a congealed, lukewarm mass that barely passed as bread pudding and did not have anything on it or in it that the waitress mentioned.  Even after asking for the check immediately after receiving our long-delayed dessert, we then waited another 15 minutes to complete the transaction - all the while, observing other tables that looked as upset as we were for waiting.  With no ambiance whatsoever, staff with little experience in delivering a high-quality dining experience, and no noteworthy food, I am more than a little bit angry to have wasted a precious date night and $100 hard-earned dollars on a disappointing meal.  If you're looking for the best tapas experience in Pittsburgh, skip this place - and head straight to Morcilla."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a Wednesday evening and it wasn't that crowded which was nice. We started off with the meat platter and the whipped goat cheese. For $15, the platter is great with four different types of meat, warm toasted bread brushed with garlic and topped with crushed tomatoes, almonds, walnuts, and grapes. The goat cheese was also so creamy.  Then, we had the patatas bravas and the croquetas. The patatas bravas was a large portion that we ended up not finishing. The potatoes could have used some more seasoning, but with the aioli type sauce on top it was great. The croquetas were also a hefty portion and filling. Each croqueta was nice and creamy on the inside with a crisp outside. Finally, we had the gambol al ajillo and the sea bass. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and had excellent flavor from the garlic broth. My favorite dish was probably the sea bass. The fish was light and fresh and complemented the tomatoes and truffle mash perfectly. By the end of this meal, we were both stuffed. We probably ordered 1 too many tapas. An excellent choice for anyone looking for some tapas in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great tapas and great wine. Great service. The shrimp tapas: superb. Loved ropas viejas wonderful. Yellow gazpacho wonderful. Go!! You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Came here as a group of 6 via OpenTable - easy to reserve. The space itself is small and narrow though does not feel like it is being efficiently used and there is an imbalance. The tables are all in the back and along the sides and the bar area is wide and opened - perhaps they are expecting more people for drinks?  We ordered: * 1 Paella - the seafood was cooked well and I was told that the rice should be al dente which it was. the serving size says it is for two people but would be very large portions and you would not have much room for anything else. * Tabla de Queso - everything was eaten here except the jam. when it was brought to our table we were not informed which cheese was what so point missed here. * Zanahorias Asadas - this carrot salad was just ok imo. it was nice to get a green but i won't order this again * Padron Peppers - we were told that the peppers would be a mixture of sweet, medium and melt your face off hot and would be random upon picking your pepper (they were all green with one orange). be warned at the end of the season which we apparently are at a lot of the peppers were incredibly hot which some of my friends were not prepared for. i ate mine in small bites and avoided the seeds which i enjoyed. one of my friends even took the leftovers home! * Patatas Bravas - these were good! a pile of fried potatoes with cheese and sauce is my jam. * Calamares a la Romana - these were delicious too! the seasonings were good on these. * Gambas al Ajillo - the shrimps were very garlicky which i enjoy though can see it being too much for someone as there were clumps of garlic * Albondigas de Cordero - our table enjoyed this too! * Monkfish - the fish was tender and i enjoyed the brussel sprouts that accompanied, others at my table thought it was just ok * And four of us split a bottle of Bouza de Carril - a steep price at $60 however it was a good dry white wine  Given that this is a pricey meal it would be great if we were given more descriptions about the plates as they arrived at the table like with the cheese plate. Our waiter did good at the end of the night though by doing the calculations of splitting up the bill for us (separating out the drinkers from the nondrinkers)."}
{"text":"I was coming here with really high expectations and unfortunately, this did not hit the Pittsburgh foody spot for me. I understand that this is a tapas place but most of the dishes are so ridiculously small and did not wow me whatsoever. Octopus, meh. Shrimp in spicy sauce,meh. Steak in chimchurri sauce was a nice portion but over cooked in my opinion. We also ordered the seafood paella and the mussels and clam were tiny, undercooked, and had a fishy smell. Would not go back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but the service was very poor, even on a slow Sunday night, and the paella was so incredibly salty, we could barely eat any of it. We actually brought home most of it and mixed it with white rice to bring the saltiness down - at that point it was actually quite good, because it did have plenty of seafood in it.  We debated telling our server, but he seemed so overwhelmed already (he seemed like a student) and we just wanted to get home after a slow meal. We did enjoy the shrimp and papas bravas tapas, as well as the flan. The sangria was very watery and not very fruity - I wouldn't get it again. I would come back for flan and the shrimp, but not too much else."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. We made a reservation in advanced for six. We ended up having to change our reservation time and they were very flexible about it. We were seated right away when we arrived. It was our first time coming here. We decided to order many small plates and share. We ordered the paella, the meat and cheese plate, empanadas, cana de cabra, and croquettas de serranos. We inhaled it and loved every single plate. I'll say we all spend an average of $25 per person in total without ordering any alcohol. It's a great deal for a fancy restaurant, on top of that we all agree that we're surprisingly full. I think this is the perfect place to come with a group of friends so everyone can get a little bit of all these delicious tapas. I will definitely come back to this place again. Oh and my favorite dish is the fried pork dish and the paella was so good too."}
{"text":"Went to Pallantia during a Jam on Walnut night. Surprisingly, the place was only moderately full. My wife and I ordered 5 different things: a cured meat platter, a kale salad, shrimp, wild mushrooms, and skirt steak. At the bottom were the mushrooms and the salad. The mushrooms were simply sautéed and contained mostly button mushrooms. For $12, I expected a whole lot more. The salad was bland. In the middle of the pack sat the skirt steak. It was a chimichura style, which had a nice flavor, but the steak itself was tough. The meat platter was tasty, especially the iberico ham.  It was the first time I had it, and I thought it lived up to its reputation. It was served with a nice toast and spread. Finally, the shrimp. Excellent. Served with sliced garlic and had a nice spicy kick. Overall, nice place. Good atmosphere. Slightly above average food. I would give it 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Everything was phenomenal! The ambiance was great for a date, the drinks were strong and well-mixed (we loved the sangria), and the seafood paella was citrus-y, smoky, and the best we've had (better than anything we had in Barcelona, that's for sure). The whipped goat cheese appetizer was also delicious, herbal, and classic.  The best thing, however, was the octopus. It was slightly charred on the outside and SO tender on the inside! We have never had octopus this fresh. We've been to other Spanish tapas places, many of which slice the octopus very thin, which I think might be to get around the fact that it's slightly chewy. Not this octopus. The octopus here was almost chicken-like in its consistency, and the flavor makes my mouth water just to think about it.  We will definitely be back! It did set us back over a hundred bucks for two people, but we were stuffed and tipsy and oh so satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful.  Clean, modern sort of restaurant/bar atmosphere.  We got the paella, and several tapas, including the lamb, pork, mushroom and cheese/cured meats tray.  I also had the gazpacho bloody mary which was very tasty.  The cured meat tray had Iberico ham, which I have never had before.  Similar to Serrano ham, but even more flavor - the best cured meat that I have ever had.  The pork was exceptional - cooked medium, so if you are someone who only likes your pork well done, be sure to address this.  But if you like it medium - wow, so much flavor the way they prepare it, and a bit spicy.  The mushroom tapas was great, and included something called 'chicken of the woods', which truly did have the texture of chicken breast - and almost tasted a bit like it too - but better :)  Note to the management - consider adding your phone number and hours to Yelp, and possibly getting Open Table or No Wait apps.  I think that your business will really take off in this location - good luck."}
{"text":"This place left a lot to be desired. I'd never been to a bad Spanish restaurant. Ok for the positives: the sangria was refreshing and sweet. Server was attentive. The place is neat looking. Odd moment when you are looking for a host to seat you and you don't know where to go. The negative: Let's start with the gambas al ajillo. They don't even taste like garlic. Every place I've gotten them has them in oil, here they try to be fancy and had them in a weird sauce with sprouts..? Really... and left them tasting very fishy. How do you mess up the best tapa? Moving on, the peppers... So hot they are inedible. But I'm not much of a spicy guy so they get a pass here. Lastly the paella, not enough fish. Not as much food. Kind of too watery/sticky. When I got home I was 50 bucks shorter and still hungry. I thought prices might be high because of location but food didn't really justify it. Over all very disappointed. Get it together otherwise. You'll give Spanish food a bad name."}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday night, it wasn't crowded at all and the service was great.  The bartender was our waiter and he was very attentive and made some great cocktails and wine recommendations.  We got the gazpacho (chilled tomato soup) and sandia y serrano (watermelon salad) to start.  The salad was good, but the gazpacho was amazing.  It was my favorite I've had.  For our main meal we shared the pulpo (Spanish octopus), churrasco con papas (seared skirt steak), gambas al ajillo (shrimp), and setas silvestres (roasted wild mushrooms).  While they were all tasty, the steak and octopus were the favorites at our table.  The mushrooms had a strong garlic flavor, which I liked a lot.    For dessert we had the bread pudding which was also good.  Overall a great meal and fun to try new things with helpful advice from our waiter."}
