{"text":"I think this place is really good if you want Korean fried chicken my sister order it and seems satisfied (she and kfc fanatic)I had soft tofu stew that had 70% of seafood than tofu I'm not saying it's bad but I was expecting for a tofu stew and there were 2 other dishes but wasn't that great."}
{"text":"For the last few months, I've passed by this place with curiosity, cause of Mon Ami's reputation as well as my affinity for all things Korean. You see, I grew up in Los Angeles' Koreatown before it was even called Koreatown, my neighbors and childhood friends teaching me about the finer aspects of Seoul life before being Korean was hip. I watched my old neighborhood become a Korean enclave right before my eyes, and so when I pass the aroma of bulgogi or hear a \"halmoni\" yelling at her grandkids, it feels like home. Anyways, all that to say, I was excited to finally check out the Mon Ami \"Express\" near my crib.   Not knowing what to expect, I decided to stop by on the way home. First things first: no KBBQ tables. That would probably where the \"express\" part comes in. There is a small dining area that has roughly 7 or 8 tables depending on how you configure them. I asked the kind server which fried chicken he recommended and he suggested the original \"crispy\" (no sauce). The other options had sauce (sweet and soy garlic, respectively). There's also the option to get those on the side, but I opted to go dry. The verdict? Great, solid, crispy fried chicken with a little kick. I kinda wish there was some kind of sauce but I wasn't complaining too much. Next time maybe I'll do the sauce on the side thing.   There were other dishes on the menu: ramen, soon du bu, kim bap, and other Korean standards. They also had lunch specials. Can't wait to come back and try. Maybe with a group of homies so we can share :)"}
{"text":"3.5. Food was tasty.  They initially charged me full size instead of half size. When I told the cashier, she was kind and returned me cash. The order was done brought to me quite fast. The waiter is very polite (Korean manner).  The thing is that I ordered a take-out. When I get home, I realized they got my order wrong. I ordered chicken wings, but they give me the whole chicken. Hope it would not happen to other people."}
{"text":"Wow, this is some amazing fried chicken! I think the recipe is the same at all locations, so this would make sense. I ate three pieces of it, and I can't remember the last time I stuffed myself like that. The other items I had (seaweed salad, imperial rolls, kimbap) were all good, but that chicken is seriously the reason to go there. A little bit spicy, perfectly seasoned, barely any grease - which is a rarity when it comes to fried food. I already want more! This will be a dangerous place for me, I can already tell."}
{"text":"The ambiance was calm and warm. I loved it. The waitress was sweet and we had a good conversation. I'm glad I speak English as well of French, otherwise I would have had to rely on pictures to make myself understood."}
{"text":"fried chicken here is better than KFC. phone order takes 10-15mins while if u are inside the restaurant, it is kinda slow. Makes you wait for 15-20mins. always busy so means the food is good."}
{"text":"It's always been our thing to eat Asian food no matter where we travel.  We usually try at least a few of the local cuisine, but always default back to what we enjoy best.  We were in search of Korean in Montreal and Mon Ami popped up closest and highly rated to us.  However, they were closed on Tuesdays.  So we were able to find this Express location.  They are a small location upstairs in a suburban neighborhood.  The staff consisted of 3? people.  Lucky, we beat the dinner rush, but we ordered the soy garlic Korean fried chicken, the spicy pork rice bowl, and the tofu soup.  The Korean fried chicken was superb! Some of the best I've had ever.  The skin was super crispy and the sauce was flavorful.  The spicy pork bowl actually came with a lot of meat, the spice could have been kicked up a bit.  The only weird part was they put way too much dressing on the salad that came with it.  The tofu soup was solid flavor, just the seafood they added could have been more.  Overall, a nice little gem to get your Korean fix if the main location is closed."}
{"text":"Clean and quiet restaurant. Incredible fast service for lunch specials (served within a few minutes of ordering). Courteous service. Very reasonable prices ($7-10) for lunch specials. Tasty and average portion sizes. A good go-to place for Korean."}
