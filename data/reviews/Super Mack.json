{"text":"Been passing by Super Mack for more than 3 years and finally decided to give it a try.  I must say that it was worth it, serving is plentiful, and it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is filthy... The asian owner/server handles the cash, register, boxes and then prepares your sandwich without washing his hands... Happened 3 times in a row even though i called him out on it, and the third time was the last time. (Why did i go 3 times? because i worked midnight shifts down the street and it was sadly the only option that was not far away other than BK). On top of this, the place was shut down by the food inspector for like a month, God knows why they let them reopen."}
{"text":"If you're looking for homemade burgers, look no further! Super Mack has the best homemade burgers I've ever had!! Super Mack is a burger joint owned by Vietnamese people surprisingly (lol). I talked with the owners and they said they purchased the establishment from Greek people who opened up the restaurant in 1967. They decided to carry on their legacy by keeping the menu the same and adding onto it.

Super Mack serves a variety of food! Let's start off with the burgers. They specifically make their patties from scratch at the restaurant, hence the name homemade burgers. You got your homemade hamburgers, homemade cheeseburgers, homemade banquet burgers, homemade Super Mack burgers, and if you like to eat a lot I recommend the Triple Mack burger! You can order these burgers in a combo which comes with fries and a drink. You can upsize the fries to onion rings (the onion rings are huge!) or a poutine which I highly recommend!

As I mentioned before, Super Mack retains its Greek cuisines so they still have their Pork Souvlaki dinner, Chicken Souvlaki dinner, and Beef Souvlaki dinner. They also have NY Steak dinner too! All the dinners come with garlic bread, greek salad, and fries!

In addition to serving lunch and dinner, Super Mack also serves breakfast. This place is on par with Denny's or even better! What I usually get is the Bacon & Eggs combo, Sausage & Eggs combo, Ham & Eggs combo, Steak & Eggs combo, or Western Omelette combo. All combos come with coffee, home fries, and your choice of how you want your eggs cooked! (ex. over easy, scrambled, sunny side up).

I'm adding Super Mack to my favourite restaurants in Mississauga! If you're ever in town, I recommend trying this restaurant. You won't regret it! :)"}
{"text":"They don't wear gloves. The two greek guys were handling my burger with their BARE HANDS!! Luckily, I didn't get sick."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. They actually know my name. Excellent for those late night souvlaki runs, even though the hours are not as good ever since the new owners took over about 5 years ago. The NY steak is an excellent value @ $12. It is a better bargain than the California sanwiches next door which costs about the same. The homemade supermac burger with cheese and bacon is also worth trying. I usually get the NY steak or chicken souvlaki dinner."}
{"text":"Still garbage. Doesnt seem to be making any changes. Californiiiaa sandwhiches is hundred percent better."}
{"text":"Admit it has this ever happened to you?

You order some food or in my case order and pay. While you're waiting for the food and start reading all these negative reviews on Yelp !!
I was actually going to California sandwiches and decided to try something different. I was very hesitant to if I should have to have stayed to my original decision or gone next door. As the minutes pass by this was a good sign as it's a good 15-20  minutes to make it and everything with made fresh. The food quality wise good. I was very surprised. I thought I would go with the pork souvlaki. The meat was fine not bad... the fries which were better than anything you ever have a swiss Chate  even. It's worth paying the extra $.50 for the gravy. Overall for for a greasy spoon and my low expectations I was surprised. I would not be surprised if somebody else's experience varies maybe I just got lucky."}
{"text":"I was originally going to go to California sanwiches but after seeing the crazy lineup I decided to go to super Mack instead. 

Super Mack specializes in burgers, fries, steak and souvlaki sanwiches.  I'd compare their burgers to a harveys except with homemade patties. 

The last time I actually came here I ordered the steak sandwich and poutine. After that experience I don't think I'll ever order steak in sandwich form again. I think the main problem was that as I got further and further into it I had to squeeze the sandwich harder and also rip the bun to shreads. Maybe it was the fact that the sandwich was a bad cut. 

Today I ordered their flagship \"super Mack\".  Basically its a double cheeseburger with bacon.  The burger got topped with your choice of the norms (ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, tomatoes, pickles) but you could also ask for some of the other things they had (ie barbeque sauce or tzaziki sauce). After my condiments were put on the person assembling my burger decided to squeeze the living crap out of the burger and manhandle it into a wrapper (wow).  I was surprised that the burger was still in one piece.  The outcome was a pretty big burger that didn't really fit in your mouth when you tried to bite in the first time.  Guess the burger inflates itself up after getting beat down.  

The burger was... Okay. Parts of the burger were burnt and crispy while other parts were perfect. Since they make their patties themselves I guess that's why it's so inconsistent but I never have any problems with my homemade burgers. Other than that the burger was quite tasty. 

The fries are horrendous. You know how Swiss chalet fries used to be?  All soggy and limp (ya I also used to work there). That's how they were. I personally like fries that don't look like they need Viagra to straighten up or at least be a little more crispy.

I think the worst thing about super Mack was the ventilation in the place; especially at busy times. The smoke from the grill in the back wasn't really getting ventilated resulting in a fog around the restaurant. I bet that's really good for the people eating here. CO poisoning anyone?

If anyone is thinking of coming here don't bother. Just go next door to Cali."}
{"text":"I think if I needed a spoon (you generally don't for burger and fries) it would actually have had grease on it.
The place was grungy and had a weird layout.
Burger was from frozen patty which resembled the no name brand from a supermarket... and tasted like the cardboard packaging from said burgers.
Fires were decent and the price reasonable, but the burger, just no.

Maybe they do other menu items better, otherwise not sure how they stay open."}
{"text":"Too many menu items to choose from.  From a burger joint to greek and fish and chips.  They should stick to a specialty and make it better.

If you are craving greesy fix... this place will do it.

Staff here does not seem too friendly either."}
{"text":"Saw this place a few times but never tried it.  Wife wanted to get California Sandwiches next door so I took this as an opportunity to try Super Mack.  I always thought the name was funny, but love to try little diner style places so I went in.  

First off, the place is really dingy and kinda gross.  I wouldn't sway it was dirty, but it did look like the decor hadn't been changed in decades of use.  Things seemed like they were falling apart and they even had an outdated tube style television on the wall.  With that said I wouldn't recommend eating in.

The menu options have the standard fair, burgers, fries, souvlaki, sandwiches, etc.  I opted for the home style banquet burger, fries and gravy.  The place got pretty smoky with the grill but since I wasn't staying to eat I didn't really care so much about that.  The topping were set up like a Harvey's style counter were they dress the burger how you want it in front of you.  

I wasn't very hopeful of the food based on the looks of the place, but it wasn't that bad.  Burger was homestyle, freshly ground patty and not from frozen and tasted good.  Toppings were fresh and the burger was decent overall.  The fries however were terrible.  No salt, and they tasted like the oil needed to be changed and they were really dark as well, which was another indication of the oil being old.  I consider myself a gravy fiend and put it on just about everything, so whether or not I like the gravy at a place often indicates if I would go back or not.  This place had decent gravy, a little salty, but I like it that way anyway.

Price was better than a lot of places.  I got the food for $9 and change.  I have paid more at McD's on a few occasions so I was pleased about that.

I would go back if in the area and craving a burger, but since there are other options in the area, I probably wouldn't be back for a while."}
