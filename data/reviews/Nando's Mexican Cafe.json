{"text":"Nando's has some really good dishes and an atmosphere that is not typical of East Mesa........it's actually fun.  The number one item on the menu is the Pollo Rico.  I won't describe it, just order it.  It's delicious.  Gets a little crowded at the bar early with the old Las Sendas people that, for some strange reason, think they are the true upper crust of America, but push them out of the way and find a seat at the bar, where you will get good service."}
{"text":"I love Nando's!  Pollo Rico is amazing, as well as the enchiladas ongo and enchiladas del mar.  Great drinks and local craft beer on draft.  Try it."}
{"text":"I'm giving Nando's at the baseline location a 1 star review simply for one reason the manager is a complete idiot after we ordered food and then complained that the food delivered was not what was ordered and by the way ate approximately one quarter of the burrito we decided to alert our server and correct it.  A few minutes passed and the manager approached and said because we had eaten a portion of the burrito she was willing to charge us half price for that one and full price for the one we just ordered...??  So... we used to go there 2-3 time per month..!  Now we will not go ever again..!   Average bill well over $100 each time, hope saving $6 was worth it to you , idiot manager"}
{"text":"This new Mesa location (about 2 weeks old as of this writing) is kind of quirky.  It's situated right on the South side of McDowell road across from Red White & Brew.  I often drive by and glance at the folks sitting outside.  

We chose the porch as well, which was goodly-sized and equipped with hanging lights and a flat screen TV.  Must be nice at night.  I'm not sure if they have misters but Red White & Brew does.

The interior is spacious and the bar looks comfy with many screens, but it's not a super big bar, just very simple.  The restaurant has a chain feel, but the staff are very friendly and the food options were plentiful.

I ordered the spinach enchilada lunch special (really nice) while my sister got the bean and cheese burro (it's big).  Even the kids' meals seem large in portions.  They offered my nephew a \"kids menu\" but it was really a piece of paper and two crayons (orange and purple - Go Suns!) on which to color.  (The regular menu includes the kids menu).  Mixed drinks looked pricey but beer seemed reasonable.

The food comes fast, tastes great and the restaurant is very comfortable.  This would be a good stop before heading up to the Salt River to do some tubing.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite place to go to in the east valley. The chips and salsa are always spot on. Plenty of margarita options but the house margarita is very good. We usually go in large groups and the staff is always very accommodating and the service is always top notch. I tend to judge a Mexican food restaurant by their ability to make a good chili relleno and they do not dissapoint. I always have a hard time deciding what to get because everything I have ordered was great each and every time. My wife and I come for lunch occasionally and split the nachos and we can never finish them. Nandos will remain our go to place!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner on 25 Oct.  We ordered the usual ... guacamole/chips and pizza blanco.  Since I don't drink alcohol, I ordered a virgin frozen margarita with salt.  When my drink arrived, it didn't look like the other virgin frozen margaritas I have had at the restaurant in prior visits.  I asked my husband to taste it to make certain there was no alcohol in it.  He said he couldn't taste alcohol but he thought it tasted different than usual.  We ate our dinner and requested the check.  My husband finished his beer and I drank some of my drink that was no longer frozen but melted.  

Within just a few minutes, I was breaking out in a terrible allergic rash before I left the restaurant.  We immediately drove home (a few minutes away).   The rash was now appearing all over my body and my eyelids were swelling.  I was having difficulty breathing.  My husband took me to the hospital.  After being discharged many hours later in the wee hours of the morning, my husband drove me home.    

Mid day I drove to Nando's to speak with them.  In particular, I wanted to speak with the bartenders.  Three or four people came to speak with me.  They informed that there had been no changes in the recipes for guacamole or for the pizza blanco.  They also informed me that what most probably occurred was either a frozen pina colada had been given to me OR there was \"cross-contamination\" when the bartender did not appropriately cleanout the blender when making my drink and there was remnants of a pina colada in the blender.  

I purposefully order a virgin frozen margarita because there should be no pineapple juice or crushed pineapple in it.  PINA COLADAS CONTAIN PINEAPPLE!!!  Because of medication that I take daily, I also do not eat or consume anything with grapefruit as it conflicts with my meds.  I informed the people that were talking with me that I am EXTREMELY ALLERGIC TO PINEAPPLE.  I also informed that I was just discharged from the hospital and had to pay a substantial hospital deductible amount at the time of my visit.  I showed them the hospital bracelet tag that I had just removed and had in my handbag.  

To my complete surprise, the general response from the people speaking with me was astonishing.  Pineapple was in my drink and that was all they said.  If I owned or managed the restaurant, I would most definitely have made an offer of compensation ... for the hospital charges, for the dinner we just had (the receipt was still in my handbag), or an offer of a future dinner at the restaurant.  Nothing ... or should I say NADA!!  

If Nando's cannot be more careful and particular with what they are serving, this is no longer the restaurant for us!"}
{"text":"Tried Nandos for lunch.  Food is bland and salsa was not very good at all.  Tasted like something out of a bottle and just loaded it with chili flakes.  Good size portions, but that doesn't make up for the bland food and it was pricey....I don't see anything special about $9-10 for lunch specials!  Only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because their chips are good....sorry, but will check this one off our list :("}
{"text":"First off, any Mexican place worthy of mention has good beans.  The beans at N. are so dry and flavorless it's like eating chalk.  Secondly, cheddar cheese melted atop every dish and that is NOT Mexican!!!  3rd- I ordered chile verde.  WHAT???  It was a slab of dry pork covered in Green Sauce!!!! DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! You cant go wrong here. Don't forget to order the queso dip for an appetizer, and the chocolate nachos for desert!"}
{"text":"The spinach enchilada, shredded beef tacos, and fajitas are great! You also can't go wrong with the pitchers of margaritas! Everytiime we have gone the service has been great too. You have to at least once try the nachos on happy hour, they are huge!"}
{"text":"like this place,  but clean after you close... for the love of god, pay people to stay one hour later and clean up,  or do it before opening. cleaning does nothing for the dining experience...."}
{"text":"Do not waste your money. Worst chimachanga ever. Carne asada very good the tortillas were a disaster. Soggy. Chips and salsa nothing special. Chips
 old and stale. Burrito wrapped in cardboard. Taco salad dressing not good either. Besides it was expensive. Across the street is the red white and brew which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went tonight and sat on patio... Very relaxing and great service. Food was excellent and very filling."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service, consistently tasty!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I eat here frequently and walk away satisfied every time. The only reason why they are not getting 5 stars is because I enjoy sitting in the bar area and typically the service is awful in the bar. It got so bad for awhile that I quit sitting in the bar for fear of the service. I have started to sit in the bar area again and have noticed some improvements but it is still very hit or miss. Stick the the main dining area and you will be much happier."}
{"text":"Asked for a taco and asked if the shell was fried.  Waitress told us yes, it was a regular taco shell. Food wasn't anything amazing. Food size was good but overall experience is a don't go back there."}
{"text":"Nando's has good food, however their service is slow. They are popular and there is a long wait. The wait for food is longer than the wait for a table. I complained and I was not compensated. I was told that the service was slow because of the big crowd. They are not equipped for  the number of patrons they seat. It is simply not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  Service needs some work.

The food was excellent.  There were three people in my party, and all three enjoyed their food.  

The service, however, was mediocre.  Perhaps our server was new and inexperienced, but he started taking our order, then abruptly left our table to go to another table across the room to answer their question.  Right in the middle of taking our order!  Once our order was in, he was okay.  But, we had to wait several minutes after we were finished eating before he brought the check.  Then, after leaving the credit card, he disappeared.  After 25 minutes, we got up to leave and had to find the hostess to let her know we were still waiting for our bill to come back.  As we were talking, our server came with our check.  (Apparently, they had accidentally thrown away our gift card and had to fish it out of the trash...)

We will probably go again because of the food, but hope they step their training of servers..."}
{"text":"On Monday, July 8, 2013.  I came here with two girlfriends for a planning meeting.  We ordered 2 margaritas and a beer.   The chips were good the salsa....not great.   It was Margarita Monday.  The margaritas were not very good.  Then we wanted a couple of appetizers to share.  I asked our server if they had a chili con queso dip and chips.  She said that they did not.  We ordered Nando's nachos and a cheese crisp.  The nachos had \"queso dip\" poured all over the top.  They couldn't throw some in a bowl with chips??  Both items weren't that great.  We got a 2nd round of margaritas.  Didn't even get a buzz....tasted so much margarita mix - needed more tequila.  

My husband wanted me to bring him some dinner.  We ordered his just before we left.  I ordered him an El Numero Tres - Cheese enchilda, taco, rice and beans for about 12 bucks.  My husband didn't feel well after he ate.  The next morning my husband threw up.

I don't know about my girlfriends, my friend that tried the margaritas agreed with me, but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Really bad food, went once, won't go again. The food was blend and not authentic at all. I was even more disappointed cuz this place is pricey."}
{"text":"Don't let the location and crowd fool you into eating here. This place was shockingly terrible. The salsa tasted like a can of tomato sauce; the chili con Queso sure tasted like Mexican Velveeta; the nachos were overly cheesed and lacking key ingredients like beans, sour cream and guacamole; and the grounds were littered with old straws, napkins and cigarette butts. We were extremely disappointed. We ate a few bites of our food and left. The ambiance was decent, but the service was nothing to write home about. There are several other delicious Mexican options in the same area in the same price range."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food.  This is our favorite sit down Meixcan in the East Valley.  Our usual order is the Pizza Blanco.  Giant fried flour tortilla topped with cream cheese, chicken, tomatoes, cheese, and peppers.  We split this and usually take half home.

I'm also a fan of the a la carte burritos.  

Thumbs up for being kid friendly as well."}
{"text":"Definitely going back for more. The chips were unexpectedly good. I was surprised at just how much food they give you, especially at lunch. . I had the Spinach Enchiladas which were perfect. The white sauce was good, and it was not too heavy for lunch. Everyone else enjoyed their food as well. 

Also I saw the nachos at another table. They were huge and looked amazing. Also I spotted some kind of desert in a taco salad shell and chocolate nachos. I hope someone else orders it and lets us know how it is. 

The wait staff was very attentive. (The fact that Fox News was filming there could have had something to do with it.) She warned us that the portions were large, and she was not kidding. Make sure to have room in your fridge for left overs- even when ordering from the lunch menu. Oh and parking was so much better than at red White and Brew."}
{"text":"I love this place! Wonderful chips, salsa, and margaritas! All the meals we have had here have been very good! Fun place for friends and family!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with Eric.  It was decent food, but not even close to the best mexican food I've ever had.  I would eat there again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do it.  It wouldn't be a destination for me anyway.

My mom-in-law and sis-in-law love it, I didn't find anything to write home about."}
{"text":"Was taken here for moms day, we got right in, however server forgot items that we ordered, remembered after we were almost done. Hard to get his attetion for refills and check. Like food and will go back but never on a busy night/ any holiday."}
{"text":"I had the El Jefe chimi.  The steak was not tender and had little flavor.  Same for the refried beans.  The burrito shell was soggy too, because it was smothered under sour cream and guacamole.  I have been here before and the food ranged from good to acceptable.  The other folks in my party liked their food, but agreed that it could have more flavor."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service beyond subpar. We waited over an hour for food on a Thursday afternoon only to be told by the server that our ticket was never even put in. Did not give us anything to compensate for our time spent waiting for food. Charged me $7 for a small side kid's quesadilla. Complained and the manager would only lower it to the kid's meal price. I didn't even order a kid's meal because I knew my son wouldn't finish the whole thing and I didn't want to spend extra money, I simply wanted a small side cheese quesadilla. Very disappointed with the customer service."}
{"text":"Best service in the valley. Wait staff is great smiley and on top of there guest. I have never had better service than here and I have visited dozens of times. The food is delicious and I have never had anything bad nor anyone that I came with."}
{"text":"A great meal!  Chips and salsa were good.  Salsa tastes similar to tomato paste"}
{"text":"I really wish they had a Nando's in California where I live! It's the best Mexican food I've had! So good, I crave there enchiladas and rice and beans and chips and salsa ect.   good service. Great food. Decent prices. Also, if you like cheeseburgers, they have the Nando's Burger, it's one of the best burgers ever! Go, go, go"}
{"text":"If you like mexican food, this will become one of your favorite mexican joints.. and actually if you like cheeseburgers, they have the Nandos Burger, it is AMAZING! 1 of the best I've ever had!! I'm a big ranch dressing fan too, and it's Sooo good! Great mexican & American food together. I think that's pretty awesome myself. Always get either cheese enchiladas & rice & beans (because that's my favorite and the red sauce is exactly my style) or the Nandos Burger, (because it is mouthwatering)"}
{"text":"This place is one of the noisiest Mexican restaurants I've ever been to.  The food is very average for the price. The decor reminds me of a Mexican restaurant in a strip mall.  I wouldn't waste your money."}
{"text":"The food at Nandos is phenomenal. The portions and the size of the plate will fill you up guaranteed. I've only discovered this place a few months ago, but out of any Mexican restaurant I have visited, Nandos easily takes the number one spot of my favorite place to eat. Also, the service they provide is excellent. I have never had to call my waiter or waitress over to ask for a refill, and my requests for extra hot sauce was fulfilled the minute it was requested. 

The prices are high when compared to the other Mexican restaurants I have visited, but if you come from 11 AM to 4 PM you can order the lunch specials, which I recommend big time. I have never had a bad experience when I visited Nandos, and I am sure I never will."}
{"text":"Today was terrible. I blame the manager. Our server was doing double duty: server and bar tender. The food was slow and the service even slower. May or may not come back for awhile ."}
{"text":"No matter what night I've been there they are always busy.  The wait isn't usually that long, the hostesses are always nice and polite. The wait staff is also nice, any one of them will help. The food is ALWAYS amazing.  Comes out nice and hot. The portions are huge, most of the time  I have to ask for a doggie bag.

I recommend this restaurant to everyone, my In-laws had been visiting and wanted a place to eat, we suggested Nando's and they loved it."}
{"text":"My family and I just left this Nando's and we were extremely disappointed in the service and food.  I order green Chile burro enchilada style.  It was not worth the 13.00 I paid
  There was no flavor, it was bland.  In fact I dumped 2 containers of their spicy sauce on burro and it was still flat.  I have tasted better green chile from a can.  My grandkids were also not impressed. My grandson said his taco meat was tough, flat in flavor. My dinner tab was $63.00.  A total waste.  We waited a very long time to be seated.  Waited again to place our orders and then had to wait forever to pay our bill.  I will not be back.  If you are looking for good mexican food, avoid Nando's"}
{"text":"Wish there was 6 stars. This place on the weekends for breakfast is fabulous.  The menu is full of great selections, but you have to try their Biscuits and Gravy with Chorizo when it is on their special.  The Green Chili Pork plate with an egg on top is equally as good.
Trust me you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hair in the salsa. What felt like a piece of sand in the deep fried cheese crisp. Refusal to let me order off the kids menu despite my recent surgery and documentation to support it -- you know because if an adult orders a kids sized portion (ie a normal portion) it will magically cost the restaurant more money. What the...?

Seriously not worth it and I won't go back."}
{"text":"Nandos is one of my favorite restaurants ever! I always get the same dish every time. Enchiladas!! That is my go to food always! No complaints ;)"}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place using yelp and were very pleased.  We visited for lunch. The service was great.  The atmosphere was clean and tasteful.  The food is was fresh and good quality.  If this place was next to a Macayo's we would go to Nando's every time without a doubt."}
{"text":"I've probably driven by this place a hundred times over the four years I've lived in Gilbert and not noticed it. Last night, after reading my fellow yelper's reviews on Nando's Mexican Cafe - I decided to give it a whirl. At first I wasn't sure exactly where it was but after driving behind some of the businesses on Baseline I found it tucked in the back. The parking lot was completely full which led me to believe this place isn't a secret after all. 

As I walked up I noticed a beautiful patio with lots of ornate iron work. The restaurant was hopping with only a 10 minute wait. Since this was an experimental choice for my group we had our server recommend the most popular items on the menu. He quickly responded with the Pollo Rico and also suggested we try the mini combination plate as an appetizer. The combination had an assortment of all the items including the infamous Pollo Rico but in a miniature size. With the advice of our server we ordered the mini combo platter, chicken fajitas, El Jefe Chimichanga, and Enchiladas Del Mar. Our main courses arrived but the appetizer didn't show up. We were kind of disappointed until our server came along realizing we hadn't received the appetizer. He said he'd comp us for it even after we said we've got more than enough food. My fajitas plate literally took up half the table!!! I swear there was a pound of chicken which I barely put a dent in. I was great to be able to try a few of the other restaurant favorites from the appetizer plate. My only somewhat negative comment would be I thought the Jalapeno Cream Cheese on the Pollo Rico was really salty. Now it might be that my taste buds are ultra sensitive right now due to a low sodium diet. In any case my brother in law also thought the cream cheese was pretty salty. Other than that, we were all completely satisfied with our meals and couldn't get over the portion size. We ended up each taking home leftovers that I'm sure will take me a few days to eat and my big brother even managed to feel full / satisfied!!! 

This place was so yummy! If you're in the area, give it a try."}
{"text":"Great food! The food here is so much better than their Gilbert location. Not sure what happened over there, but as soon as this location opened the food in Gilbert when DOWNHILL. I prefer the service at the Gilbert location but I will only come here now as the food does not even compare.
Barrio Tacos, and El Jefe Chimis are amazing.  I also ordered the Ensalada Asada and it is HUGE!! For dessert the Fried Ice Cream is the winner! Their Margaritas are HUGE and very strong. 

The server told me they use a gold tequila in there normal margaritas. Just one margarita at $5.25 ad I was good to go. If you love Mexican food go to this location. OH YEAH And the Spinach dip is to die for!!"}
{"text":"We love Nandos. It is the best food EVER!! It is just a little local joint in Gilbert if you blink you would probably pass it, but we just went to there new location on Power/Mcdowell and it was impossible to miss. Our family are huge fans of their original store, but their second store was even better than the first. The Spinach Con Queso is amazing! The fajitas are big enough for a family of 4 to share NOT KIDDING! The kids meals are enormous and the best part we have found that we can go any day of the week if we bring an A paper or A report card our kids get a free meal. Our family loves this restaurant we go at least 4 times a week. The best part is the staff is the same everytime. They get to know our kids and are just so kind! Thanks to Nandos for opening this awesome establishment in our neighborhood! oh yeah great margaritas too"}
{"text":"Late Sunday brunch with my husband. The service was good, we were greeted, seated promptly, and drinks refilled and checked on adequately. The food was average, at best. The Chorizo con Huevos was not good, the chorizo was undercooked. The beans taste like they are from a can. The enchilada sauce a light orange flavorless sauce (very likely also from a can). The rice was bland.  There is an attempt to compensate for the poor quality food by providing immense, cheese covered servings.  We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"good cheap mexican food. quick service.. pretty consistent."}
{"text":"Sub-par food, the shredded beef is tasteless, the hotter version of salsa not spicy, and happy hour is only reserved for bar! We found that out after we ordered a few drinks! Such a bummer! We won't be back for the food or the prices!"}
{"text":"The patio was a great place to sit and eat.  Service was pleasant but it took about 10 minutes after we were seated to place a drink order. Yes, it was happy hour, but the patio was less than 1/2 occupied.  Our server graciously extended happy hour for 10 minutes to allow us to have another round of drinks.  We never got menus when we were seated so our server had to bring them, delaying our food order.  We ordered food and it came out pretty quick and nice and hot.  There were 4 in our party and everyone ordered something different.  We had Mesquite Tacos with pork, Sonoran enchiladas, Barrio tacos, and the taco/enchilada combination plate.  Everyone's food was covered in cheese and we unanimously pronounced it all fair at best. This was a pleasant restaurant, fair service, but the food is not our idea of Mexican.  We might come back for a burger-- they sounded really tasty on the menu, but not for the Mexican dishes."}
{"text":"As I wait for my bill so I can go home and cook I am extremely disappointed. Let's start off with the dirty cups that were on my table imprinted with lipstick. Secondly my boyfriend and I started with the combo platter and the plate was so hot we couldn't touch it but the food was cold. Not even a little bit warm. I also asked for a side of guacamole while ordering and was advised by the server it came with it. He failed to mention that it is a small dollop covered with lettuce, tomatoes, and black olives. I decided to look past this and start trying everything. The tostadas were soggy. The Pollo Rico was not seasoned at all. It was literally boiled chicken in a burrito. The mini tacos had tough meat,and the \"flautas\" is actually just 1 cut in half. The beans tasted like they were out of a can and not authentic. And when I decided to ask for a side of guac to add some flavor to my food it took way long to come out and was disappointing also. I don't really complain about food but boy was I extremely disappointed and pissed I just wasted money. I gave them 1 star because the chips were good."}
{"text":"Excellent food over time is not as easy as it seems. Nando's always delivers tasty food along with great service. Highly recommend a visit if your in the mood for Mexican. 

Keep in mind when you order a combo, that you can customize any choice - for me a cheese enchilada and a taco becomes a chicken enchilada and a shredded beef taco."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I've eaten here a few times. Food is always out quickly, but service is fairly poor. Servers don't make many table visits and take their time. But seriously, the food is great."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. Service was horrible. The food was just as bad. Asked for the waitress' opinion on an item and she said \"the mexicans that cook here won't even eat here, they think the food is that bad\" I ended up getting a bean burrito and it was horrible. I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"My first time going to this restaurant and will NEVER return. It was not busy and yet when I walked in I was not acknowledged and the hostess stood there looking around the restaurant slowly trying to seat a table of 4 in front of us. Even though there were two hostesses we were not acknowledged for nearly 7 minutes. One of the hostesses did looked at us (party or 4) and then proceeded to answer the phone without saying anything like \"be with you in just a moment\" and took an extensive to-go order while we just stood there. Finally we were acknowledged & she took us to the most crowded part of the restaurant and we asked to be seated in a quieter area. This posed a problem and the hostess had a bit of an attitude but seated us in a corner in another area. While we did receive chips and frozen or old salsa immediately,  it took nearly 15 more minutes before the server arrived to take our drink order. At that point we were ready to leave. It was not nearly busy enough to have that slow of service and who knows how long it would've taken for our food to be prepped. We were completley underwhelmed by this place. If you are looking for a place where people move at a snail pace, this place might be right for you... Otherwise, I would steer clear!!!"}
{"text":"The service at this place is extremely poor.  First they brought me the wrong order and when they brought the correct order it was late and cold. These people are very incompetent.  It was a bad experience and I won't be back. The prices  are high also. Yuck."}
{"text":"I was a fan of Nando's years ago as the owners took a page out (and also worked) at Ajo Al's off Camelback/16th Street-staple of that area. I went there Wednesday for a quick lunch at 3:20 p.m. with my mom. We settled on splitting the mini combo platter. I should of known better after the \"Do you wanna split the mini combo?\" I had in previous years always ordered the Chimichanga w/green sauce, which was always average-not bad. A safe choice.  When I pictured what they described in the menu as The mini combo platter I wasn't shocked with the two tiny beef taco's, and Chimi's,  two SOGGY tostados (was disappointing) then this weird thick square piece of melted cheddar cheese that the waitress, when asked said was covering a pollo rich??? Huh? Rich Chicken (no language barrier at Nando's). Underneath this glob of cheese was shredded dried out chicken deep fried in a tortilla covered in a jalapeno/cream cheese sauce. End of story, this place is great for people who don't care if it's authentic Mexican/Hispanic food because it's not. Think...upgraded Garcia's.Their salsa tasted like tomato sauce, no kidding. Another disappointment. Done with Nando's, gave 'em one more chance after two years. I'll stick with Juan's and Barrio Cafe, even Backyard taco! Oh, and don't think for a sec I thought this place was ever authentic. I just liked the atmosphere and their shredded beef Chimi's! Service was great though!"}
{"text":"There are very few places where my girlfriend and I can agree to eat. We have completely opposite tastes in food, so going to dinner usually leaves one of us feeling a bit unsatisfied. 

We've agreed on Nandos three times in the past two weeks. 

The food is always excellent. As soon as you sit down you are given chips and salsa that are entirely too easy to fill up on. Both the fajitas and the quesadilla had a very generous portion of steak, easily the biggest I have ever had at comparable places. As a diabetic, I almost never eat sweets, but the fried ice cream is just too much to resist. It is so good that I happily sacrifice a day's worth of insulin to eat it. 

The service is outstanding, and the atmosphere is bright and friendly."}
{"text":"I've never really had to wait to sit, even if there is no parking. (parking lot is always full)
The food is delicious and the service is usually pretty great too.
I love the Pollo Rico!!!"}
{"text":"We've been going to this Nando's for many years and it seems that this last year service and food quality has gone way down.  We went there for lunch on this past Sunday. The place was more than half empty with customers so it wasn't busy. After being sat by the hostess we had to wait an exceptionally long time for the waiter to come to take our order. We noticed that many of the male servers / bussers were usually just chatting,  visiting, laughing in groups of 4 or 5 in different parts of the restaurant (but mostly near the bar area under the tv) . We had to make eye contact just to get our server's attention to come to the table. We had to ask for more water and salsas during the meal. Back in the day servers weren't allowed to just stand around chit-chatting, joking around while customers watched on.
Besides the service I've noticed the quality of food has gone way down also. I had the lunch special chimichanga and the meat had the texture of mush. Very over cooked! We're going to have second thoughts about visiting this place again in the future. The little mom and pop places seem to have tastier foods and definitely better service where work isn't to annoy the customers."}
{"text":"I just will NOT eat here anymore. Tonight was the breaking point for my family at Nando's. 

We live close by and have come here often over the last couple years but continually have come away not feeling well after eating. The chips/salsa is good but the food is so damn SALTY and GREASY!!!. 

My wife ordered a plate of grilled vegies to try and eat healthy...they came out looking brown and slippery cause of all the soy sauce and butter. She even requested to have them cooked with low salt and low butter...didn't help. 

They smoother many of the dishes in so much cream cheese and cheddar that you know your belt will fit tighter the next day. We ordered the chicken taco pizzza from here a while back and both of us threw up VIOLENTLY that night. My wife was so sick she had to go to urgent care and get hooked up on an IV. This is a true story. 

Even a simple muchaca burro, not deep fried, isn't clean or healthy. It is so SALTY you can't get the sodium taste out of your mouth for hours later. GUESS WHAT...Nando...yes the man who created the restaurant...he recently had a QUADRUPLE BYPASS HEART SURGERY...because he \"liked his food salted heavy\" and probably greasy too.. This was explained to me by the people who work at Nando's. This is true facts. 

The food does taste good here for the first bite or two, but then it just makes you feel bad when you leave. Sorry Nando's, I have thrown you away. My body rejects you."}
{"text":"Love having nice neighborhood restaurants fill this corner!

We've been here 3 times...lunch, dinner and happy hour.  Food consistently good, although they put alot of cheese on everything.  Beautiful patio to meet friends and enjoy a margarita!  

It was a little loud when we went for dinner on a Friday night, but I guess that's a good problem for them...it means they are full.  We'll keep this in our monthly rotation for sure."}
{"text":"This is my most favorable Mexican Restaurant in the East valley. Awesome awesome Food, good size portions, their Salsa's rock as well as their Margarita's. Service is quick from the time you're seated!"}
{"text":"Wife loves the greacy-licious cheese crisp and I come here for local craft beer. Food is great (with limited vegan options) and local beer selection is awesome. We are regulars and service is usually great!"}
{"text":"The portions here are gigantic! So be prepared for leftovers.  I really like the interior of this restaurant too. It is dark but in a really good relaxing way.  The best things to get in my opinion is the chile renello or the barrio tacos.  I also love the pollo rico.  Another standout aspect of this place has always been their service.  It is always very welcoming and efficient."}
{"text":"Great margaritas, lots of food, good value for the money."}
{"text":"The decor is nice and the staff is friendly and good at what they do. Unfortunately the food was not so great. I got enchiladas and the chicken was dry with the sauce way too salty. The seafood enchilada didn't have much flavor. The rice and beans were nothing special. Everyone's plate was huge and the food looked good - but everyone's was just ok - or worse. It was a busy night so maybe the kitchen was just overwhelmed? We're just visiting so we were bummed it wasn't better."}
{"text":"1. It was very busy due to big group dinners but they set us pretty quick. 
2. Asked to bring me a bowl of salsa instead of little cup. He did without question. Later on found out they serve salsa in a plastic saki bottle. 
3. They took forever to bring our food. Ended up eating 3 full basket of chips and salsa.  I have to say they have pretty good chips.  
4. My food was HUGH!  It will be my lunch & dinner on 26th. Save my belly for better Christmas meal! 
5. Overall, great first experience. It is American + Mexican style and for that I will say this chain American + Mexican restaurant is pretty darn good. I didn't expect authentic Mexican from a chain store and you shouldn't expect that either. If u happened to find one than great but leave that expectation for small hole on the wall or mom and pop Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Eeeewwww!!! Not only did they mess up my pick up order, the food was gross. Got the salsa but NO CHIPS! The 3 hostesses rudely pointed me to the BAR to pick up my food, only to be waiting forever to be called in... What a joke. Got home and what I ordered was not IN MY BAG, starving I tried to eat it anyway....yuck. Blobs of cheese, tacos burned to a crisp (that's a first) enchiladas were runny ( not with cheese) disgusting!!! I ate here before , never a problem. I don't know if they had an off day or what. But $30 worth of take out food should be at least satisfactory...... This was NOT."}
{"text":"Have not been to Nando's since disappointing meal there last year .
Started out with quick seating and ice cold beer & Cold chips and bland salsa. Park tacos had nice pork chucks , but dry and unseasoned. Also had steak tacos with even less appeal, unseasoned and dry.
But the beer was cold and server LOGAN delivered it well.
Won't be back."}
{"text":"Living around the corner from here for years, I just visited it last week for the first time. The service was awesome. I couldnt drink my water fast enough because our waiter kept filling it at the halfway point. Portions were huge... especially for the money. I had the fajitas, which I think were $12, and that lasted me for 3 meals. The biggest downfall was flavor, or lack there of. It was good, but seemed like it was missing something. I will be back to try some other stuff from the menu, and some drinks."}
{"text":"My picky 8 year old begs to come here - almost daily.  Can't say enough about the staff and the \"juicy chicken\" & the skinny margarita is one of the best!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I always get bad service. The food is good, but the servers are SO RUDE!!!!! that's so unacceptable. My mom and I come here all the time. And we even brag about this place. So, unfortunately we are going to find a new Mexican restaurant from now on :("}
{"text":"Went here on the way out to the airport after our family holiday visit.  The place accommodated our large party with kids and the server was great to split the checks.

The food wasn't anything fantastic unfortunately.  I had a chimichanga and it was \"okay\" -- I probably wouldn't come back on my own, but was good for this group with some picky eaters who want things that are predictable.

I prefer my mexican to be more authentic.  The service was great though."}
{"text":"I had my first Nando's experience last night. The place is good. I would say this place falls above chain Mexican places,  but falls short of smaller independent places.

When we arrived we were told it would be a 30 minute wait for a table, but we were seated within 15 minutes.

The salsa served with the chips was ok, pretty bland if you ask me. 

The menu is pretty big and has many, many options to go with from the specialty plates to the combo platters.

The portions are very big. Half the party I went with took home over half their meal.

The food was above average. I had a healthy portion of beans, rice and the enchiladas were big. I do wish there was more red sauce. Most of the enchiladas were covered with cheese. I wasn't a fan of the onion inside my beef enchilada. I wish I knew about this before. Not a fan of chunk onions in my food.

My biggest complaint was the rice. The rice just didn't measure up to other mexican/spanish rice. Rice is one of my favorite things when eating Mexican. 

The service was very good. Our order was out quickly, sodas refreshed and bill all served quickly. 

You get good value for the good served here. Most plates were around $11-13

I can see myself going here in the future.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"What is a Mexican pizza? Seriously, this place is not Mexican food. It reminds me of when you try Mexican food in Spain- nowhere near authentic. You can't call it Tex-Mex either, as that would do Tex-Mex a disservice. It's quite pricey for a rather boring interpretation of \"Mexican\" food."}
{"text":"My Wife and I went to Nando's to celebrate her 27th birthday, and I have to say it was a big disappointment. We had the house margaritas, which tasted like it was all mixer and no liquor. The salsa was stale (tasted like old tomato sauce) and the chips were fresh but not salted at all. I ordered the steak fajitas and my wife ordered the chicken fajitas.  I was hoping that the fajitas would turn my sour mood around about the place, but no, it did not.  My steak was so bland and didn't even taste like it was marinated at all. Also the steak didn't even look like steak (the pieces of meat reminded me of Mongolian beef). My wife's chicken was the same story.  We really didn't even touch our meals and quickly asked for the check.  Also I think there was something wrong with the salsa because my Wife and I started to feel ill. This used to be my wife's favorite place to go for Mexican food, but after this experience we will never go there again."}
{"text":"Went to Nando's to meet family for lunch, and although we had a large party, we all enjoyed the food and service. It did take a while for us to get our food but our waiter kept checking in on us often. I had the tacos al carbon and a Cabo margarita on the rocks, YUMMY! We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The breakfast tacos & breakfast pizza were a little overdone. The last two times the service wasn't all that great. Because it's close to home we usually run into somebody we know. Makes the waiting a little more tolerable."}
{"text":"Went here for a family dinner on a Thursday night. The food was actually quite healthy for Mexican. Very flavorful. The atmosphere was nice and Christmasy  this time of year. I would definitely return. Excellent food. And big portions.  Staff was attentive and very good also."}
{"text":"Love this place.

Love the food.

Love the hotties that work there."}
{"text":"I like to eat at Nando's every once in awhile. We were near by so this was our choice. The wait was about 15 minutes, less than they stated. We had margaritas to start. I don't like most margaritas when eating out but these are not so sweet. I had the Seafood Relleno that was delicious. They have a ranchero sauce that's over it, not heavy, very good. They give you an abundance beans and rice and unfortunately I ate all of it. It was very good, the beans tasted housemade. My husband had the chimichanga and it was huge and he said good. My granddaughter had the beef fajitas, good and enough for both of them to bring some home. I recommending giving Nando's a try. More than enough to eat."}
{"text":"You don't get much better customer service than this. 

We had driven around the parking lot twice and one of the employees recognized it, flagged us down and moved his own car to let us park our big a** truck in a parking space. We regret not getting his name so I could put it in this review

Oh, and the food is awesome too. We've been back time and again.  

Thanks Nandos!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, have now had a bad experience twice in the last week. What used to be my favorite restaurant has really lost its charm. From a rude server to incredibly slow service at breakfast our family will now be going elsewhere for our go to neighborhood restaurant. Even after talking to the Manager, I don't think he really cares if they retain customers and offered little in the way of apology. Bye, bye Nando's! No longer for us!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our meal tonight at Nandos. Portions were large and delicious, 
beers were great, and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Went here for a Sunday breakfast. After waiting more than 5 minutes to even be acknowledged at the hostess stand, it then took more than 10 minutes before we got menus or a drink order taken. All of the employees on shift (including the manager) just didn't seem to give a crap. As we were finally wrapping up our meal, the lunch shift staff was coming on, and they all seemed much more willing to actually do their job. I have frequented the Nando's locations, and could not believe the lack of service here. I probably won't be going to this location ever again, and being that it is the one closest to my home, probably none of them."}
{"text":"My family eats at Nandos all of the time. The food is always served hot, tastes great, and you get plenty of it. You will not go home hungry. The costs are reasonable. Great bartenders. The have some of the best chips and salsa. Watch out for the hot salsa,they are not kidding when they tell you it is hot. The severs are always very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I love the food here!  But, tonight I had a reservation for 8 at 6:30 and it is 7:15.  We are still waiting!! Why bother with a reservation Nando's?  So disappointed."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are some of the best I've had in AZ.  The house margarita was decent, also.
 
Service was fine.  The booths are small and really close together, so you'll be staring at the guy facing you in the adjacent booth.  Lunch overall was decent, but underwhelming.  My burrito was nothing special, and they didn't have great lunch prices."}
{"text":"bland food meets bad service...and something would not digest so I was reminded of the experience for hours!!  Had they put as much time and moeny in to the recipes and service instead of the property it woudl have been much better.  Nice location but there are much better alternatives!!  yo qiero tace bell after this one!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, although I wouldn't say it's the best, and portions are huge. The atmosphere is great with the restaurant sectioned  off for unique feels. There is also a tree covered,  large patio and indoor outdoor bar and fireplace.  We come for the environment and the patio!"}
{"text":"Very unhappy with the service. Felt as if the server was not attentive at all. Had no utensils or water cups but had the jug of water. Ordered an appetizer.. wasn't the greatest. Server checked on us when the app came out and then took our menus. Took her 15 minutes to come back to the table and asked if we needed anything..by this time I'm ready to leave. Overall not the greatest customer service.."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere! Best salsa, mild and hot served and they are great to mix. Great service too! Will definitely be back to sit out on their patio."}
{"text":"F'king amazing!!   Pollo Rico!!!  Stuffer with a flavor from the gods!! Jalepeno Creamcheese  and white tender chicken smothered in cheddar!!"}
{"text":"A favorite routine spot for the family! Great food and great service! Great happy hour and margaritas"}
{"text":"Nice local restaurant for a relaxing meal. Outside equipped with Misters as well as fireplace for those chilli AZ nights."}
{"text":"Awesome food and amazing people.  This place has such a great atmosphere.  Nandos is definitely one of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the potato jack taco. It is so unique and completely addicting! I wish Nando's wasn't so popular so I could go there more often. I usually do takeout, bc I can't wait 45 mins for a table. Their other food is pretty good too."}
{"text":"The food is always great here and service is usually good. We ordered our dinners. I went to ladies room and when I returned my date said they brought his food but not mine. The waiter ASKED him what did I order!!!
My date refused his food until mine was delivered.
The waiter took my order for a second time. Another 15 minute wait.
No apology or even asking if the food was ok.
I was very disappointed by that young man."}
{"text":"I finally found a second fav Mex place to dine. My first is Rito's in Phoenix . I grew up in el paso, tx & know good well executed Mex food & Nando's  
Cuts the mustard. There are few good Mex places to eat here in Phoenix. I'm so thrilled to have found Nando's. I had the #9 plate. I pray they expand into Phoenix and the west valley"}
{"text":"Good food, came out really fast, the music was really good, the server was polite. Was a little pricy if you don't order a lunch special."}
{"text":"I always ask my Mexican friends for reccommendations on which Mexican restaurants to eat at. One of them told me this place is the best in the valley so I just had to try it. I've been back a dozen times, at least in the last 2 years. The food is always excellent, the service has always been exceptional and the price is right. I love the HUGE amount of chips they bring to snack on while waiting...it makes it so I don't ever have to order an appetizer."}
{"text":"Sorry folks....I don't know if there is a lot of dead taste buds out there or we just
get confused with portion size and quality of the food....
I took my MIL form Oregon other day to have lunch (second time...first was soon after it opened and was not impressed then-too much cheese...) and although it is very nice  inside and service was very good....I cannot say much for the food. Sure...you get huge quantities but it is more \"gringo\" food than any kind of spices or flavor..even my MIL who knows little about good Mexican food said \"this is bland\"....
I ordered the chicken burro..it was huge...stuffed with large white tender chunks of chicken...
totally tasteless. I had a whole mouthful of the chicken and there was absoulutly no flavor!  I then tried the Tostado...nothing more than refrieds out of a can with lots of cheese, lettuce and tomato on top..I can make this at home...when we go to a restaurant we want a step up at least from home cooking....
Anyway the list goes on....what it boils down is the lack of any kind of spices or herbs
or even \"smoking\" the meat...Remember Tia Rosa? They smoked their meats and had a herb garden in back....talk about many flavors!!!
To be fair...maybe its what I ordered....I am willing to go back and try some of their
specialty dishes...maybe this is what their known for....not large quantities of \"gringo\"
food...."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this spot for happy hour! Based on service alone I would give 5 stars to the Friday night bartenders, but the food isn't quite there. I would also love to see the happy hour extended to 7pm to compete with some other places in the area. The Mexican Pizza during happy hour is really tasty and the free chips and salsa are also a nice touch."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place from a friend. I decided to try it. I had the seafood enchilada & ice tea. The tea tasted funny. The enchilada was okay. Pace picante sauce is better than their salsa. I spent $15 for a lousy lunch. I won't go back."}
{"text":"I loved the flour tortilla chips but the salsa was not hot enough more like a pico. The food was over priced for the taste"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant in the EV now it's a great shame. Menu has changed slightly but the quality is on serious decline!"}
{"text":"Celebrated a family member's birthday here last night. A place she's been wanting to try for a while and I'd never heard of before. Our party consisted of 20+ people and I must say we all could not have had a better time. The food was great - I tried the Pollo Rico and my wife had the Mesquite Tacos - excellent!. What gets the 5th star is our amazing waitress, Charlene. Even with our large party she was attentive and managed to keep our drinks full and she got our orders out quickly and took very good care of us until our party ended - and this, on a very busy Saturday night. We will definitely be back and highly recommend Nando's!"}
{"text":"Very yummy!! Great service!! Had a great time with my family and we will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"First time here because of reviews on yelp,our enchiladas were wonderful, I can still taste the flavorful shredded beef,our waiter, Ismael was very nice, his responses to my questions were all the truth! Enjoyed the margarita's ( my date didn't drink his, didn't go to waste). We brought the chk enchilada hm, too much food for two old sweetheart's. My husband & I will be back soon, excited to try more on menu. Price is good for quality you get!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service.  Dropped by while in town, got a seat right away and food shortly after."}
{"text":"I recently discovered Nando's in Gilbert on an unexpected drive by.  Needless to say...when they opened the one they built directly behind my house, I was thrilled.  The food is unbelievable.  I have been dying for a good Mexican place that makes me happy...and I found it, finally!!! I am a chips and salsa-aholic, and this place doesn't disappoint.  Salsa could be spicier, but I have a small child and he loves it, and the flavor is so great, I could drink it.  Yum.  They do bring a small container of spicier salsa, and it is good enough for me.  They didn't get 5 stars from me simply based on the fact that the children's meals are completely over priced.  $4.95...not too bad, however that is without a drink or options.  $2.75 for a lemonade for a kid is ridiculous on top of the $5 for food.  Ugh!  Also, my son loves the grilled cheese (it is big) but he would much rather have the carrots and celery with ranch offered with the wings than the 5 pounds of french fries they put on his plate that go to waste.  (Hope the owners read these!).

That being said...I have to say...one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten...and would recommend to everyone is....the PIZZA BLANCO!!!! OMG.  Enough said.  It is big enough for four people (wish they would offer a smaller serving!). Two can order...it does heat up great.    I did venture past it and get a chicken quesadilla this time...just as amazing.  It is a tortilla with cheese and chicken for goodness sake, how can it be so good??? What does this place put on it's chicken??? I actually think the chickens walk into the kitchen and just surrender because they know how damn good they are going to taste after they are grilled!!!! KUDOS to Nandos. :)   Even better, I can drink too much and walk home!  I recommend the Prickly Pear and the Huckleberry margaritas!"}

The chips were stale, my tostada shell was stale, I opened my napkin to find my fork was dirty, the salsa was very bland. We were there at noon and it was dead!"}
{"text":"My favorite go to for amazing Mexican food. I easily go here 2-3 times per month, typically for lunch because the lunch prices are good. Love, love, love their chips and salsa at this location. The staff is always super friendly and courteous. I've never had a mediocre server let alone bad. I have a couple of go to favorites on the menu but everything I've tried has been amazing. 

Great food - Check!
Good prices - Check!
Amazing staff - Check!
Great location - Check! 
Patio seating - Check!  --When it gets cooler anyway! ;-) 

To top off all of the above they have one of my favorite beers on tap, locally owned Papago Brewery's Orange Blossom!!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour and some genuinely friendly wait staff and bartenders!  Tasty Mexican food and they bring you two awesome salsas with your chips that you can mix to make the perfect combo!  Outdoor patio is killer on cool days and evenings as they run misters and the wait staff is always checking on you. Never thirsty here :-) The enchiladas and tacos are top notch and if I didn't eat so many of those really tasty chips each time I go, I probably could sample some other menu items!  Get down to Nando's on Dobson and Germann and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a place you could take somebody that has not been to a Mexican restaurant in Arizona all the food is really good including the chips and salsa. Very consistent not too fancy not too shabby a good in the middle."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD! Such good food here.
Been here 2 times with the family. I loved it,"}
{"text":"Everything seemed bland and generic. No authentic dishes here. The salsa tasted store bought."}
{"text":"Love this place! Come here every time I visit Arizona for one thing....the shrimp chimichanga appetizer (which is very filling) they are so good! Crispy with shrimp and a sauce inside and a cream cheese like sauce to dip them in."}
{"text":"The prices are a little high. The steak is not the best option for meets but they do have very good chips and salsa."}
{"text":"The Pollo Rico was really delicious. I would go back. It wasn't overly busy. Service was a bit slow. By the time I got a refill on my drink, my food got cold. Otherwise, nice place and atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Tried to find a way to send this to you, but you don't have a 'contact' form on your website or a message option on Facebook. I just had lunch (Check # 531092) and noticed a discrepancy on our bill. Instead of offering to fix it, we were told we didn't fully understand how the price worked. I ordered lunch special G, which is a red or green burrito, taco and a tostada. It is listed as $8.95. On our bill it was charged as $10.70 as the base price for \"1 Lunch G\". I pointed this out and was told that since I ordered it enchilada style (which I didn't, by the way, it just came that way) I was charged more. I pointed out that it clearly says \"red or green burrito\". The hostess told me that this is the color of the chili used inside the burrito... which makes zero sense as there is literally JUST chicken inside. Rather than make a scene, I told them it was fine, but it's not. You cannot quote one price and then upcharge for no reason. I believe you have this item in your system at the wrong price, but instead of looking into it I was told I just didn't understand the price. Side note, Justin our server was excellent today and our food was very good. I'll definitely be asking very specific questions about what my food ACTUALLY costs if we come in again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant ever. My fiancé and I just moved away from Chandler and we miss Nando's! This was our regular spot. The margaritas are so good, and we would always get the border chimichangas (beef). The staff were always so friendly and if you sit at the bar, you feel like you're around friends. They need to add a location in the north valley!"}
{"text":"I just took my parents to Nandos because I had gone to the location in Chandler and had great service and food. Unfortunately this was definitely not the case at this location. We ordered a cheese crisp as an appetizer, all of the food ended up coming out at the same time. We asked for them to take back the cheese crisp because it would have gotten cold. I am vegan and ordered a guacamole taco and black beans without cheese and my meal came out smothered in cheese. They did bring it back out quickly and the food was decent. I was told that through my work I get a discount and I received that discount when I went to the Chandler location. The manager came out and gave me a round about story about the programs they offer and that isn't one of them but she will check into it. The cheese crisp stayed on our table the entire time even though they said they would take it back. We still got charged for it and all of the employees we encountered had terrible customer service. I definitely won't be back to find out if they offer the discount."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad. Despite being a busy Saturday night, the service was pretty darned good. We had our drinks refilled regularly and our food came out promptly (and was hot). 

The food overall was really good. The beans were creamy, as was the guacamole. I love their guac. Their fried ice cream wasn't too bad. The selection of food to pick from is wide which is also nice. 

My only complaint is that the food is a bit greasy. Even the chips that they give you have a thin layer of grease over them, which you notice more and more as they cool off. 

I definitely would come back here again."}
{"text":"Ehhhh so so. Pretty bland for mexican food. Not impressed. Service and ambience were good, however."}
{"text":"I would say that we have eaten at Nandos no less than 150 times since they first opened. At one point when the kids were young, we ate at Nandos ever Monday night.  The last 3 times we have ordered take-out, there has been something missing from our order. Last evening; again, they forgot the tortillas for the fajitas. Of course I called to let the manager know and after having this happen 3 times in a row, I asked to see if I could get anything credited to my card. The manager said, well you can come back to get the tortillas. Um, NO, how about you drive them over to ME! Of course I only thought that and didn't say it as I wanted to keep it civil. I explained about our past experiences as well as being a long-time customer. Again, I asked if she could credit anything to my card. She literally said to me, it's only the tortillas so I can't credit your account but I can have some ready for you if you want to come back.  I felt like my order and patronage was not a concern for this manager so at that point I knew I wasn't going to get anywhere so I just hung up. It's disappointing that we feel like we have to go into Nandos to get quality food and service."}
{"text":"Everyone love a fiesta right???? Well this is the place to get your Cinco D'Mayo on!!!

Start with the nachos layered and piled high with all the fixings!!! Beuno!! This could be a meal in its own but bring all your friends and share because we are just getting me started. Try the queso. Bueno!! Try the guacamole. Bueno!! Drink the top shelf margaritas!! Bueno!!!

For the main course...pick anything. I've tried it all and was never disappointed. Ask them about their favorite shrimp dish...the way they describe it is exactly why I get it almost every other time I go here. 

Sit on the patio...ask for a mariachi band every night of the week. That is what this place needs. More music. More salsa. More merengue. Bring your dog especially if you have a chihuahua."}
{"text":"We really liked this place! The service was great , and the food .... Oh wow delish!! We will be going back!"}
{"text":"0 ZERO STARS!!!!!  The wait staff act like a bunch of monkeys when cleaning and settings up a table throwing all the plates, cups, bowls and silverware on the table.  They splashed food and liquids on my back when cleaning the table behind us!!  I asked the female manager who had a nasty attitude right off the bat why her staff was throwing the items around like it was their last table to finish for their life. Her lame sarcastic  non customer service response was sorry it's a Friday night things happen!  She refused to credit or comp us anything for being hit with food and liquids!! Not to mention the sounds of throwing items on the table while we were trying to have a peaceful meal.  This place is noisy, dirty and nasty it has some of the crappiest food and service I have ever had in my life!!I  STAY AWAY!!! The food is better at any other place than this!!  This was my first and last time to this crappy place. 0- ZERO STARS!!!!!"}
{"text":"We just discovered Nando's a few months ago, and I think we have already been there 3 or 4 times.   The food is really good- try the guacamole and chips!   We have never had trouble finding a table, even when it has been pretty crowded.   They also offer some nice combos so you can try a couple of different things."}
{"text":"Started out tea was spoiled, I  asked server for coke instead,  after 10 minutes I had to ask the Manager to get 1. It was the worst chocken tamale I ever had. My niece got spoiled saice on her food."}
{"text":"We had a business lunch on Friday, they were so busy, but we got in the restaurant  and got seated very fast. We were waited on very promptly. They have such good, tasty mexican food better than  I have had in a long time. We had four adults and ate for around $10.00 a piece. The portions were so big that we ate our leftovers that night for supper.

This place has three other chain restaurants around the Phoenix area, you won't be disappointed. Very good, lots of cheese, tasty try it you will like it.

{"text":"We've been here over a couple dozen times and love it - primarily for the great happy hour deals.  The margaritas are super tasty and strong. The Mexican pizza is huge as are the nachos. Both are way too big for one person.  Try the sliders - again a generous portion.  You won't be disappointed.  When not eating off the happy hour menu, we usually eat the chorizo or machaca huevos. Muy bien!"}
{"text":"As a companion said, we should have ordered to go boxes to come with our meals. Scoop half the plate into the box immediately, and then you have a reasonable meal!

Chips were blah, but food was great. I had the El Jefe Chimi. Loved the seasoned chicken with onion, but not dripping in cheese. Rice was a nice companion. Service was prompt, and they were great with the kids. Love that they keep a pitcher of water right on the table."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Definitely my go-to Mexican restaurant! If you haven't tried this place yet, you need to! Keep up the great work Nando's!"}
{"text":"I lived in California for many years and didn't realize how spoiled we were with the Mexican food.  Here in the Phoenix area, we a had a lot of trouble finding a Mexican restaurant that we wanted to return to.  Nando's has great food, a warm atmosphere, friendly staff and reasonable prices!  We will return again and again!"}
{"text":"I have to update my review after my experience today. I came in to enjoy a nice lunch with my husband only to be frustrated and disrespected! Let's start off with the dirty plates and cups which I quickly set aside and we should have left then. The waitress came over and wanted to get our drink order and I let her know that we needed a minute. After about 10 minutes I went up to the bar and let her know we are ready to order. She seemed to have an attitude and said with a tone \"oh, well I was just taking care of other things\"
She came over finally and then we ordered 2 appetisers a lunch plate and a to go plate.
She brought us the cheese crisp tray and we let her know that we didn't need it. We had to tell her 3 times and she rudely took it away and then she proceeded to talk about us laughing and twirling the tray to other employees and the manager. I felt so disrespected at that point and again we should have left but didn't.
At this point we did get our appetisers and watched multiple tables get their food way before us when they had come in way after us. I thought they had just forgotten about us.
Finally the food came out and the manager took it to the wrong table. Ok...it happens. 
So we ate kinda, as some items were cold and stale and others were extremely hot!
Then I asked the waitress for a to-go box and some extra salsa to take with the leftover chips and she just brought me the box. I asked again for the salsa and she rudely said \"I can't give you any to go, that's the policy.\" I said since when? We have been coming here for years??
She rudely said it's always been the policy and that everyone else wasn't doing their jobs right so she can not let me have any salsa. 
My husband was pretty upset at this point with the entire ordeal so he looked at the manager and she quickly started telling him about the salsa issue. He then took off to the back and wouldn't come back out so we could inform him of all the issues. (which I'm sure he knew since he was part of the issue)!
This is entirely unprofessional and disrespectful on so many levels. You don't treat a paying customer like this.
It seems that there are different employees and manager in today. Service has gone downhill and everyone seems put out, rude and lazy!"}
{"text":"Bad food, very slow service. The food is not Mexican at all ! Definitely not going back here again."}
{"text":"Their Faja Pasta is delish! I have always been a fan of their chips and Chile Con Queso Dip. They always give you a large amount of chips and salsa, which I usually fill up on before my actual meal, haha. 

It does get really busy so sometimes the service isn't as great or personable. BUT, its okay because the food is great!"}
{"text":"Very big sizes.  I recommend getting a takeout box, you will have extra! The food is very tasty and very delicious.  Service is always great! This isn't the most authentic of Mexican foods, but they have a great menu and great infusion of different styles.  There is typically a wait on the weekends, but well worth the wait.  This has become a regular spot.  I suggest the Del Mar enchiladas, but I have had a lot on the menu.  You will enjoy.  I promise!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the East Valley.  And the portions are huge, just plan on a to go box"}
{"text":"Food just isn't very good, too salty as another reviewer said previously. Not very authentic either, think of an upscale version of your favorite Taco Bell entree. Dishes lack spice and substance.  Even my margarita was weak. I wasn't amused. Prices were on the higher side of things, and service was just OK. Took a business party here for lunch and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great Margaritas...but bar table service is slow and lacking.  I enjoy the atmosphere and friendly people who go in there. It takes  a long time to get a server to follow up with a table.  Disappointing.  They need more staff to support the crowd."}
{"text":"Our group was doing a painting class at uptown art and stopped in here for dinner.  What a find!  The ssrving staff was terrific and the food fabulous...highly reccomend the pork chop dish.  Probably the best pork chips I've had in years.  Moist, juicy and cooked dark with great sause.  Yumm"}
{"text":"This is average bland Americanized Mexican food.  I ordered cheese enchiladas with green chili sauce.  The plate arrived with an enormous amount of melted cheese on it.  I eventually found the enchiladas under all the cheese. In time I did encounter a fragment of green chili.  Overall, I felt like I could have stayed home and just put two pounds of cheese on a plate in the microwave."}
{"text":"Very good food , and the services there is great , the bussers are awesome and great with cleaning up! I wish they kept Gary"}
{"text":"Generic American Mexican food. Nothing special but the chips were good. Busy place. Probably won't come here again."}
{"text":"As a Mexican food expert, this place has a solid 4 star. Don't take me wrong, is way far away from the real thing, but the flavor is good, the quality is great, the ambiance is cool.

Nothing not to love about this place. 

The salsa is great and the carne al carbon is pretty tasteful. I might reduce the size of the servings, though. 

Great addition to the area!"}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance.   Perfect place for patio dining."}
{"text":"Someone told us to try this restaurant,so we did. Came on a Tuesday for the taco special. Wow. Excellent food. Finally found a good Mexican restaurant. The taco Tues. special was three barrio tacos with all the fixings,rice and beans for $8.00. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Great Tex Mex. Shredded beef tacos in fresh made shells, chimichangas, party platters, cheese crisps, jalapeño cream cheese... amazing food, amazing taste, amazing service..."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Terrible drinks and the worst salsa of any Mexican restaurant around. I honestly think what they give you is actually store bought hot sauce not even salsa and certainly not fresh. There are a lot of other Mexican restaurants in the area that are much more deserving of hour"}
{"text":"So I have to say how disappointing the food was. The waiter was great and a very nice guy but the food was so tasteless. I don't think I've had Mexican food so devoid of flavor since well... ever. I tried two different items and they both were horrible. I had a beef chimi and not even being deep fried could save it. Another member of my party got green chili pork burrito and it was also flavorless and what little meat was in it had a bad texture. It's such a nice building and I was excited to try this place but I just left shocked."}
{"text":"My first time going into Nando's wasn't the greatest experience. The service was slow and the waiter was not polite at all. However, they were pretty busy so I thought it may have been an off night. Went in a couple times after, and again, the service hasn't been great, but better than the first time.

The reason for the 4 stars is solely based on the quality of the food. Personally,  I really enjoy the street tacos. We usually come here every other weekend and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Pretty good food! Great service! Lots of options. Personally I think there are better Mexican restaurants out there, but I will be regular here since it's close to home."}
{"text":"its near Red Mountain Ranch area- which is a few blocks away- As excited as we were to have a \"Mexican place\" near by open- we were very, let me say this again- VERY disappointed!!!!! The decor is great, the outside patio is great- the service was fine- So...what is the problemo??? 
THE FOOD!!!! We on purpose ordered everything from Fish ( tasted like frozen who knows what) to Chicken ( rubber duck) to steak (extra leathery CHEAP CUT rubber)- For 3 - no drinks our check was over 65 dollars and we DID NOT want to go boxes- very poor food- 
I seriously hate to admit that Taco Bell across the street has softer, better steak cut than these guys...further to add more to laughter...the manager behind us was telling the table next to us 'how they are stealing business from Other places near by'- I shook my head in amazement...... will give them 1-2 years...by then - everyone has tried and moved on to Better - way better places! Too much waitstaff also to support such place and very poor cooks! Me no HUNGRY...(anymore)"}
{"text":"Let me first start by stating that I'm an ovo-lacto vegetarian (meaning I eat eggs and milk products) but no meat or meat products (such as chicken broth, lard etc...) so my two-star rating is informed by that. I usually am successful at finding great food at mexican restaurants since many have transitioned away from using lard in much of there food and provide some fresh, vegetable based options. Not so much at Nando's. After informing our waiter of our vegetarian status, he wasn't sure what was vegetarian or not. After asking the cook staff, we found out that there is lard in the enchilada sauce (UGH!) and beans. We ended up ordering some cheese enchiladas with salsa instead of the regular sauce. 

In terms of what we ate, it was okay. If you like lots of cheese and eat meat, you may love this place! It's your basic mexican restaurant fare (lots of meat, beans and rice) :) Also, the atmosphere was nice (adorable patio) and would consider going back for margaritas. But in terms of food, I'll keep looking for a mexican restaurant with some healthier, vegetarian friendly options and a staff who is confident in what they are offering."}
{"text":"I am absolutely amazed there aren't more reviews and praises for this gem of a place.

I've lived in Phoenix *forever* (cue Sandlot kid imitation) but I had never heard of Nando's.  It took one generous roommate and three short phone calls to direct him and I to... (soft nostalgic music)... Nando's.  

This place will never be featured in the food section, and never on anything artsy or \"modern\", but the taste and flavor of their normal, and fantastic fare will forever be etched in my mind.  But on to the specifics:

My roommie's a vegetarian (sigh) and ordered their spinach enchiladas with this amazing creamy cheese sauce on top.  He, I kid you not, licked up every single last drop of the cream sauce.  I ate my pride (along with everything else) and tried his enchiladas.  They are freaking amazing, but not as much as my food.

I ordered the mesquite grilled chicken tacos, on corn tortillas, and it came with a huge portion of grilled veggies, rice, guacamole and pico de gallo.  The pico de gallo was gone in a second... I treated it like a palate cleanser between the main meal and the chips we had (did I mention they have fantastic chips and salsa?).  The rice and guacamole were....well... hate to be a downer, but they were only so so.  The tacos and grilled veggies, however, were perfect.  Whoever was manning that grill knows his (or her) job very very well.

As an aside, I also had an amazing breakfast the next day of tacos, rice and salsa."}
{"text":"My fiance and I love this place and frequent it often. We love their chips and salsa and to be honest, we share the same meal every time (Pollo Rico) because we're too chicken to branch out! I wish I knew how they cooked their chicken because I am so picky about ligaments and chewy stuff and they have never had any! The Perfect Storm margarita is our favorite and consistant every time that we go in. The only fault I would find is that if you're not a huge cheddar cheese fan, they cover most meals with a ton of it. I work around it to get to the good stuff!"}
{"text":"Softride pretty much every restaurant on corner of Val Vista and Baseline and for the price you can't beat Nando's great chimichanga really good fajitas the sauce is pretty good can give you a huge basket of chips on the chimichanga I got the machaca which a great flavor little spice and a good amount of onions and the tortillas fried perfectly crisp just didn't care for the rice didn't taste very good service pretty decent add the drunks always full and chips never stop coming different place to try"}
{"text":"Love to check out the local owned/opperated places.  We had heard wonderful things about the Gilbert location, and decided to try the one in Mesa.  We ordered food for my daughter basically right when we sat down, so that she would be eatting fast.  Was shocked at how fast her food came out.  Our food took a bit longer, as they were rather busy.  For the most part, everyone liked their selections.  My only comment is to be sure and read the beans that come with dinner.  I'm not a fan or refriend, and when I realized that...requested to change them.  Before they could switch, the food runner brought out our food."}
{"text":"Nandos has the best Mexican food ever!!!  Huge portions and great service.  The prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"I love mexican food. Most of the time this Nandos is good, but the one in Gilbert is much better and much more consistant in the freshness of the food as well as the presentation of the food than the Mesa location.    I do like the staff at the Mesa location, I eat there so much I know them all.   I do wish however, that the consistancy was better and that they would make the chocolate nacho chips FRESH..  They only make them once a week and they are absolutely NASTY by day three but they serve them anyway despite the NUMEROUS times that I have expressed this to the staff in the past.  I will continue to go there because it is close to my house.  The staff and management are nice and acknowledge you when you walk in the door. That is saving them a little bit in this review.   FRESH chocolate nacho chips is all I ask!!!!!"}
{"text":"Crowded and loud but the food is pretty damn good for Mesa.What is up with these places serving american food??"}
{"text":"I have been to Nando's many times since the last review.  First, the chips are ALWAYS tasty and the salsas are flavorful.  As far as the food, I would say that the portions are still huge but that the food tastes merely good not great.

I wish they would have more imaginative combo platters and more reasonably priced appetizers.  I can't believe that they charge $16 or so for a Mexican pizza-that's a bit much!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were hungry for tacos and we really enjoy Nando's.  It was a beautiful night so we sat outside on the patio.  Yes.....me....I sat outside.  LOL   I don't care for real hot salsa and theirs is perfect for me.  Their shredded beef is flavorful and moist.  The only negative I have with this place is every time I have been there the wait staff is not a friendly as I would like and they do not make eye contact.  That is a pet peeve of mine."}
{"text":"I can't find a contact email otherwise I would have contacted them directly and given them a chance to respond/correct. Alas, here I am on Yelp.

The food was delicious (The pollo Rico is in fact very rico). My seasonal marg was as strong as a cross fit-er.

I just have one major complaint. Our party of 5 was seated at a long booth. They repeatedly passed things from behind me over the back of the booth. It was the weirdest thing. All of a sudden, there would be an iced tea by my ear. I don't care if it's convenient for the server team, it was jarring and odd."}
{"text":"Kinda bland and kinda pricy for what you get. The seating and atmosphere are nice, but there are better options in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave him a one-star was the queso fundido was actually good. Tthe ground beef has no flavor the shredded beef at no flavor the chicken had a little bit of later we had one of each Taco has a taco salad no flavor to any of them the hot sauce when the server brought the hot sauce he mentioned not too bad today not a good thing to tell a customer"}
{"text":"Love the red chili beef burros. Hearty basket of chips and salsa served upon being seated. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Mexican restaurant since 2015, about twice a month. There portions are huge and service used to be better than it was. They went sky rocket on prices compared to other Mexican restaurants in the area. Plus if your going to pay that much, my main complaint is stop messing up my order, than blame me! No matter if I order take out or right there at the table with the waiter standing in front of me, the order will be somehow wrong. They have new hostess, besides 1 (she's amazing- Katy), new bartenders, a lot of new waiters."}
{"text":"This location in Gilbert is awful. I'm a regular at the Nando's in Mesa (McDowell) they have the Gilbert location beat hands down. 

I ordered take out, I called in, right? I got put on hold twice- once right as I said \"take out\" next was because I have no clue, she said \"hold on I have to get management approval\". I ordered simple items- 2 bowls of red chili, tortillas, lunch special A (enchilada and taco with rice & beans), side of rice, and a pint of hot sauce with chips. Needs no approval right? Had me wondering at least. Well I got to the restaurant and it was pretty dead- 2 employees working only. But they bothed seemed friendly. My ordered didn't take to long but what surprised me was when the guy came out with a box. Normally it's bags, instead my order was in a box... The problem with this location is the FOOD. The enchilada sauce is salty, the salsa is bland and tastes bad, even the hot sauce is bad, red chili meat is tough and orangish color, and finally the shredded beef taco is drier than a bone! I was extremely disappointed. I've never had a bad meal at that Nando's in Mesa. But it's my fault for trying this location.  Never again!!

The main difference between Gilbert and Mesa location- if you go in at the same time (let say 3pm) Mesa will have 7 people working. Gilbert will probably just have 2. Gilbert location didn't even have a bartender (happy hour is 3-6pm)."}
{"text":"Here with my family. Kids meals were huge and fit for an adult. Wife ordered chicken flautas and they were a little bland. I ordered a shredded beef chimichanga with red sauce... It was good.  They were generous portions on everything. Chips and salsa were ok. The environment was was nice old world Mexico and the service was good! We will be back."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! My heart is going to be broken when I move away from here! My fiancé and I are here at least once a week, sometimes more. I love how quick you get hr chips & salsa to start off! All of there food is absolutely fabulous, especially the fajitas! We have both tried so many different things & like I said have never had a bad meal!! There margaritas are always delicious, my personal favorite is the Montana Margarita! YUM! & you can't leave without getting or trying the chocolate nachos! They have wonderful staff, great service, and an overall fun time!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I  came here today for lunch and even though it was pretty busy,  the service was fast! I had the beef quesadilla lunch special and I would definitely order it again."}
{"text":"Huge portions, great margaritas and quick friendly wait staff. Bring a doggy bag becuase you'll need it for you 3 lb. food delivery. Try the potato tacos... they're delicious!"}
{"text":"I think this place is really good. Is it authentic or legit? Who cares it's really good. I have been here twice now. I thought it was good the first time but I also thought the beer was good too so I wanted to wait to go again to write a review in case the beer was talking the first time. But no it is confirmed this place is really good. Now I won't say wow this is the best Mexican food I have ever had ever and I will never go anywhere else but it's at the top of the list.
The restaurant itself is very nice. The aesthetic inside and out is great. I really like the big iron tree that is covered in lights that divides the restaurant from the bar area. It's a small place but there is plenty of room and no wait to be seated. The staff is very friendly but I have to say our waitress the first time was a little bit better than our waiter the second. They both did a great job but the waitress the first time was just a little more personable. Now the company I was with might have effected my experience too. With friends the first time and parent the second. So I might of had a little more fun and therefore a better experience the first time.
Great food. I had the Sonoran Enchiladas this time. Very good. Filling too. Awesome chips and salsa too. They may have contributed to the fullness. I also like the fact that they have real Mexican beer on tap and you can order pitchers if you want. They give you a pitcher of water when you sit down as well so you are never short on water. Always a good thing.
Overall I think this is a great place and I will be back. In fact I will be there again in a few weeks with friends."}
{"text":"I was here years ago when this was a different restaurant. I can here before on the Saturday before Easter with two friends, my mom, sister and nephew. We were seated on the patio fairly quickly. The server was nice but service was slow. There were two adults and a child who came about 20 min after us and ordered and received their food prior to us receiving ours. The food was average. I ordered a green corn tamale with cheese and I could hardly taste the corn as it was so smothered in cheese. I also had a taco but the shell fell apart from either sitting too long and getting soggy OR from not draining the meat enough before adding to the shell. The salsa was average but lacked texture. My table mates said their food was average but nothing too exceptional. I think there are other nearby mexican restaurants that I will be visiting instead."}
{"text":"Pricey but some of the most delicious Mexican food I have ever had! The chips and salsa that they bring to the table are amazing. Warm and fresh and the salsa is pretty outrageous too!!!! I will definitely be back for more. Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Food is served hot and lots of it. Never leave w/o taking some home for another day. Servers are attentive. Atmosphere is friendly   Decor and bathrooms are clean and up to date. Seating in bar can be a bit on noisy side but to be expected when friends have drinks and laughs. Family friendly, too."}
{"text":"Nandos isn't \"Authentic\" Mexican food, but it's really good. Try the cheese crisp, or the guacamole to start. If your hungry try the Pollo Rico or the el hefe chimi. The deep fried ice cream is an awesome way to finish up, and you have to try the margaritas, they are pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"We did a Togo order tonight.  It was extremely delicious and I thought the prices were very fair.  Only complain is that rice isn't very flavorful and they put our two orders of kids quesadillas in one box which cause a bit of an issue with the kids."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in after an activity with our 3 year old.  Our 3 month old was having a rough night and was very fussy. We had ordered food to eat in and  after a few minutes of him not calming down, decided to get it to go. The manager, hostess and our server all decided to let us use the empty room that was closed for the night so that it would be a little quieter and that we could enjoy our meal. The little one called down with the lower lights and quieter atmosphere. The food was amazing as well. We have never been treated like that with our kids at a restaurant, it was hands down the best service that either me or my girlfriend have ever received! To top it off at the end of our meal the waitress brought us a free fried ice cream because she could tell that we were a little stressed out. Thank you Nando's you have earned customers for life!"}
{"text":"I have been to Nando's several times over many years and I can't think of one time where I've left disappointed. Their pollo rico is my favorite dish that they serve. The staff is always attentive and friendly. If you go make sure you ask for the flour chips when they bring you the corn ones...love them! As for areas that I dislike: 1. The parking can be lacking which leads me to 2. There can sometimes be a lengthy wait depending on when you go. Guess that's a good problem to have :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Their enchiladas are the best! Love their margarita choice as well. The staff is always super friendly and the waiter/waitresses I've had have always been great! I love their outdoor patio as well. Yum!"}
{"text":"The customer service was outstanding. The food was mediocre... But my mother in law loves going here so I had to try it myself."}
{"text":"The pollo rico is our favorite, what makes this dish so good is the jalepeno cream cheese... get extra on the side!"}
{"text":"Nando's is great! To start off their chips and salsa are great. Not only are they free but they are not stingy with them they will keep bringing them out till you say no more. Everything is good on their menu, but my personal favorite is their Pizza Blanco. It is a mexican pizza with cream cheese, chicken, tomato's, chiles, onions and cheese. You wont be disappointed at all. Carful if you get the pizza Blanco you will want to order that every time you go, you will have no other choice but to order it, it is that good!"}
{"text":"Always satisfied with whatever food we get from Nando's! 
Have introduced several friends to this Mexican restaurant and they love it also!"}
{"text":"This place is very overrated and overpriced. The chips were soaked with grease and the salsa was bland. It is just a typical chain restaurant. The margaritas were terrible-they use cheap tequillas in there house margaritas, also they have a poor tequilla selection. I do not plan on returning. The staff looked a little \"trashy\" our server looked and smelled like he had not showered in a few days-YUK!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Nando's twice. Nando's is beautiful inside and the staff is great but the food leaves much to be desired. We tried multiple dishes and all were either flavorless and/or sloppy looking. 

They also don't menton their signature Apple Burro has a terrible texture and is filled with apple filling from the can. I am not trying to be rude but they really need to improve the food."}
{"text":"Hm. What did I like about this place? The service was good. Our server was polite and the indoor decode was nice. Everything was clean and orderly. The food, most importantly, was bad. So much cheese on everything. I ordered a chicken enchilada in red sauce and my boyfriend did too. The salsa was tomato paste like and the red sauce was very bland. This restaurant must serve to those who can't handle a wide range of spices. Everything blended into the same taste. By the end of our stay I had a huge clump of cheese on the side of my plate with just the small portion of chicken eaten. Probably won't ever go back."}
{"text":"The Mexican food here could use a little more spice!  After all, Mexican food should be spicy.  The restaurant was decorated well and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Drove across town to go to dinner, arrived at 7:45 sign on the door says they ae closing at 8:00 instead of 9:00, how are you suppose to know that they just change hours. How about a free appetizer coupon something besides socks to be you. We are regulars fo about once a week must pass 20 Mexican food restaurants  on our way. Not anymore, really think twice before going again. I understand things happen, but make it right, so bye felicia (Nando's)."}
{"text":"We have dined here twice and dinner couldn't have been more inconsistent.  It was almost as if it was two different restaurants.  The first time, dinner was delicious, came out promptly, and I couldn't wait to go back.  Unfortunately, our second visit was much, much different from our first. 
My husband and I ordered the exact same item both times.  We split the chicken El Jefe (Chimichanga).  Rarely do we eat Mexican food, but we have found that the portions are always enough for two people, and this entree is just right for two.  The first time the El Jefe had wonderful flavor and was full of chicken.  My son ordered the chicken fingers (although he loves tacos) because he didn't realize he could substitute the rice and beans for french fries.  He cannot stand rice and beans. The chicken fingers were fine; it's really difficult to ruin chicken fingers.
However, on the second visit, the El Jefe was full of onions.  I am not over exaggerating when I tell you I had 4 pieces of bite-sized chicken in my  1/2 of the chimichanga and the rest onions.  I kept asking my husband, do you have all the chicken?  He finally realized his  1/2 was nothing but onions too.  Who wants to sit and eat an onion chimichanga?  My son ordered a taco this time around.  It was a huge taco, but when he finally got to the meat in the taco, it was ice cold.  Not that it sat there at room temperature and got cold, I actually stuck my finger in the meat after he complained that it was cold, and it was refrigerator cold, as if it just came out of the icebox.  I didn't want to complain to the waitress about both dinner items, so I only complained about my son's cold taco.  She apologized and asked to get him something else.  By this time, he didn't want anything else.  She was nice enough to remove his food from the bill.  
So, to top everything off.  We were waiting for the waitress to bring back our credit card, and my son wanted an ice cube.  There wasn't any in my glass, so I poured some ice from our table pitcher into my glass.  I look in the pitcher, and there is a tiny, dead fruit fly stuck on one of the pieces of ice....YUM!  What a way to end our dinner out!
I know we won't be running back here anytime soon.  I don't know if I will even give them a third try.  It's just odd to visit the same place, have almost the exact same food, and the experience be so drastically different."}
{"text":"Great service staff! What's most notable about their food is how fresh it is. We enjoyed their guacamole, taco salad and fajitas. Each dish was very tasty and given with large potion size. Seems to be well known by the local people as they were quite busy."}
{"text":"Awesome! Nice updated inside of the restaurant. Service was fast. I loved that they had a water pitcher and glasses already at my table when I sat down. The water actually tastes really good, too which was surprising. Daniel L., our waiter was excellent. Very polite. Called me \"Miss\" and my boyfriend \"sir\". House Margaritas were just okay. Next time, we will try a more expensive kind. Our food was so good. I always judge a Mexican restaurant based on their salsa and their refried beans. Both passed with flying colors. So much flavor. The hot salsa wasn't really that hot. I mixed it in with the regular salsa. I ordered the \"Numero Cinco\" which was 2 enchiladas. I paid the extra dollar and got shredded beef with red sauce. My boyfriend got 2 enchiladas, 1 cheese with a green Chile cheese sauce (I sampled this and it was mind-blowing) and a ground beef with red sauce. The food came very hot and we did not have to wait long. We will be back to try different margaritas and maybe the Mexican pizza (someone else got it and it looked very good)."}
{"text":"Visited 8/17/12.

I have been here several times so once again I am surprised I have no reviews. 

This is probably the better of the Mexican Restaurants I have come across.  Great selections, endless chips and salsa, nice appetizers.  

This place is always busy!!  Always..  Be prepared for a wait or get there early. 

They also have nice selections for tequila and margaritas.  Although the tequila prices are a little high for me.  

This last visit, I as a little disappointed in the margaritas... I think a little more tequila is appropriate.  If I am paying $9.00 for a Margarita, I had better be able to taste the tequila."}
{"text":"Only one trip here. The staff was more entertaining more than helpful. We enjoyed them arguing about relationships, whose job this or that is, our waiter telling the manager to go eff himself right in front of us. Food was fine. That I can honestly say is decent."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Mexican food restaurants. We eat here about once a week. Their service is excellent and the food is delicious! We like their fajitas best."}
{"text":"Great local spot and hearty portions of Mexican food. 
Can't go wrong with a tasty margarita in this 100 degree weather. 
The chicken chimichanga has huge chunks of white meat chicken. They don't opt for the cheaper dark meat alternative. 
I'm a sucker for really good salsa and this place delivers. 
Overall it's a good place to go and grab a drink after work, some good food and unwind on the patio."}
{"text":"Food was good service sucked so bad ce from surprise for a family outing I'm heading to the gas station next door to get some water that's how bad it's sucked!!!! Only reason for two stars was the food was cooked good and was on par with most Mexican restaurants"}
{"text":"Nando's continues to deliver great food and good times! I had my best friend and his wife and young son in from LA last week and we had a fantastic dinner and the service couldn't have been better! They raved about the food and the portions...there was even enough food leftover for lunch the next day! Thanks Nando's, keep up the great service and fantastic food!"}
{"text":"Yum! Wasn't expecting this to be as good or as nice atmosphere wise. With a name like nando's was comparing it to filly bees, much better! Homemade chips and salsa. As a vegetarian I seriously appreciate the ability to order tacos, burrito, or chimichangas with veggies or potatoes! Plus you can't beat pitchers of Dos Equis! I took off a star because their guacamole tastes like it comes from a package. This place gets enough business to use real guacamole. Worth a taste if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This place was old, and greasy....
I  first entering it was loud and the floors seemed kinda old and dusty. 
The booth seats were worn, shredded and cut up our legs. The server was friendly and somewhat attentive...until she had more than one table then it seemed like she was over sat making her service quality decline. 
After trying the bland greasy food I was surprised at how busy it was here. I got a sample platter. My mini tacos were soggy, no freshness at all. The mini chimis were crunchy but had no flavor. The enchilada sauce was tasty, but again no flavor inside. The cheese was already congealed when it got to the table. The only good part were the refried beans...although it seemed as if the beans may have come from a can. The mini tostada was so soggy it couldn't be eaten. My meal was a disappointment.
My husband said his was ok...he got the tacos he had to assemble himself. He did say there was no seasoning, but at least his were not all soggy.
The overwhelmi g grease in the food however was stomach ache causing.
The kids burger my 2yr old got was so over done and clearly from a frozen patty. She would not eat it. She only ate the bun. 
They are also way over priced for the quality of their food.
We won't be returning as there are so many actual amazing and delicious Mexican food places out there...this is beyond not worth it."}
{"text":"I got the Pollo Rico.  Huge portions with lots of cheese and more cheese. The chicken was good, not very spicy.

Another member in my party got the Rl Número Seis. They did not enjoy it! I tasted it and did not care for it either. The beef was very salty and very salty with a lot of spice.

Chips and salsa were good. Atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"The food came out hot, and it was plentiful. I agree that Nando's uses too much cheese (and I am an avid cheese lover!). I prefer less heavy, more fresh-tasting Mexican than this. The food wasn't bad; it just was too cheesy/too salty. The chips were horrible, however (lacked taste and were not warm or crispy). I liked that the server put a pitcher of water on the table because I drink a lot of water with my meals, and I hate to flag down a server for multiple water refills. However, I think the pitcher was an excuse for the server to be non-existent during our meal. I don't like a server to hover, but I do expect someone to check if my food is to my satisfaction or to ask if I need anything else during the meal. Ironically, two servers did start to hover when we lingered too long after finishing our meal. I would probably come here again because the price is reasonable, and the food was prepared decently. I just wouldn't expect anything out of the ordinary with the food or service."}
{"text":"I am In Love.

We had the spinach enchilada and the pollo rico, lunch portions. There was enough to take home. Really good, all the right flavors and textures.

I had the Heat Wave Margarita, SPICY but oh so good. Be warned it is spicy.

Service was excellent, fast and accurate. Good job Maria. 

And that is all I am gonna say about our experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in at 9:45 PM on a Sat night memorial weekend with a party of 6 looking for chips and salsa and a drink. We were told kitchen and was closed for the night. They should be have recommended to sit in bar area. My party of 6 moved on. Sorry servers...Mgmt had a bad call maybe they can make up your tip. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out last night and my order was correct!! I have never had a bad experience from here!! Thanks for the amazing dinners :)"}
{"text":"Well that was disappointing.  Can't summon any humor for how disappointing that was.  Great first impression, nice big open airy restaurant, patio was open and has tiled tables, fireplace, pretty windows with big leafy designs, dug it, even talked about maybe moving the rehearsal dinner here.

That would've been a mistake.  

Seated, were given chips and salsa.  They were fine.  Server stopped by asking if we needed a few more minutes.  Fiancee responded we needed a few more menus.  My order were their seafood enchiladas, and chipotle albondigas.  The soup was oily and the meatballs fell apart upon contact, so were a bit too mushy.  Some nice spiciness, but just too greasy and broth too thin.  57 minutes after ordering our entrees showed up.  What a joke.  Billed as seafood enchiladas, mushy enchiladas filled with 1 part shrimp and fake crabmeat 9 part cheese.  Couldn't taste the seafood at all.  Ranchero sauce was fine.  Beans and rice were acceptable.  Overheard server say to another table \"Was it at least okay?\"  

No.  Never again.  What a total waste of 1.5 hours."}
{"text":"I just love the pescado tacos.  They come with a fabulous creamy chipotle sauce.  Portions are large.  Beware the food is addicting!"}
{"text":"I like Nandos it's a hidden gem. Yes the parking can be crazy, but in my opinion that's a GREAT sign. Gilbert isn't chock full of outstanding restaurants so this one certainly stands out. The service has always been tip top and you can't beat the portion size. I'm a fan of the chips and salsa and the margs. I've enjoyed most everything I've had on the menu. I often bring out of town guests here because strange as it seems it's really hard to get decent Mexican food in this area."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Love this place! The food is delicious, the service is great, the portions are more then I can eat. All the margaritas look amazing, I'm going to have to try one on our next visit. We ordered the nachos with chicken and they were perfect! Soooo cheesy and yummy."}
{"text":"I work close by, and I compare all Mexican restaurants to Si Senor's by default.  Nando's falls far short, very bland and boring food.  It's a shame, I wanted to like this place but the food is tasteless."}
{"text":"Food has No Flavor!  The guacamole was so bland, even the tortilla chips didn't have salt! The chicken from the chicken fajitas was string and chewy. The only thing that was good was the flour tortillas! Will not be back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here four times now, and love this restaurant.  The enchiladas espinaca (spinach enchiladas) are AMAZING.  Portions are HUGE. The house margaritas are great. They bring warm chips with salsa to your table,  and everything tastes fresh.  Our last visit was on a busy Friday night, and service was fast and efficient even during dinner rush."}
{"text":"I really love the food at Nando's, especially during Happy Hour in the bar - my favorite is the Chorizo hard tacos - they are awesome.  Having said all that, what I have noticed during my last two visits is the Happy Hour Margarita's almost seem to be alcohol free - no \"buzz\" or anything - even drinking one quickly on an empty stomach.  Compare Nando's Margarita's to Los Dos in Mesa, or Juan Jaime's in Chandler, and Nando's is not even in the competition.  The other thing I have noticed is the \"hot\" salsa is now very, very tame.  I love their salsa's and their mild is hard to beat.  But hot should be hot.  I will be back, and I hope the drinks will be stronger, and the salsa hotter, next time!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and the wait staff is always attentive to our needs with great suggestions"}
{"text":"Went to Nando's for the first time last night, and I was extremely unimpressed.  First, the waiter brought out a small pitcher of salsa, with two smaller shot glasses. He did not spend any time explaining what they were for, and we found out by tasting that the large pitcher was salsa, and the smaller shot glasses were chili sauce to mix in to your liking.  Could have used that advice ahead of time. 

 I ordered a Cabo Margarita.  Cabo Wabo tequila, Grand Marnier, with a float of blue curacao.  I am highly doubtful Cabo Wabo was used, it was EXTREMELY sweet, and the blue curacao was not floated, it was shaken into the drink.  

We ordered the chili con queso dip, which was a disgusting soupy mixture with soggy fried flour chips.  My fiance ordered an enchilada/taco combo, and seem satisfied, but not impressed.  I ordered a deep fried hatch green chile burro...which was absolutely fantastic, and only served to cast the rest of the food in an even worse light.  

Secondly, I had ordered a Enchilada Del Mar, \"Two corn tortillas filled with crab, baby shrimp and cheese. Topped with Ranchero sauce, Monterey Jack cheese and sour cream. Served with rice and beans.\"  It was edible, but since I like to examine seafood dishes, I peeled one apart.  The shrimp was clean, completely devained and cooked through, but IMITATION crab was used in the dish.  I have no objection to surimi in california rolls, salads, etc., but I was extremely agitated to find it inside a seafood dish, especially one advertised as being CRAB.

Breakdown -

A) Service
Service was adequate.  Food and drinks came quickly, chips were plentiful, and we were seated quickly.  Perhaps too quickly, as the salsa mixture was not explained.  However, our waiter was hard of hearing, and required menu items be pointed to, and orders repeated multiple times.  It was loud, but not so loud that people sitting across the table could not have a normal conversation.  
B) Food
Food was average at best, with the exception being the deep fried pork and green chile burro.  Trying to pass imitation crab in a seafood dish is a reprehensible culinary and business decision.  
C) Drinks
I can make a better margarita with bottled mixture.  I have never had a margarita so sickly sweet.  Absolutely disgusting.  

Summary - Will not be returning.  Probably the most unsatisfying dinner I have had since moving to the east valley, and possibly the worst \"Mexican\" food I've ever had."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chimi w/o sauce, topped with sour cream, guacamole, green onions, jack, etc.

There were all manner of meat fillings for it on the menu, but I prefer carnitas.  No problem!  Just pay a dollar more for something what costs the same as their regular fillings to make?

Chips and salsa were above grade.  Lots of both.

The waiter was great; attentive w/o being in one's face?

I asked for the Chimi to be well done?

A \"WELL DONE\" Chimi will crack and splinter when hit with the side of a fork; not this one.  It was a burrito gently dipped into the fryer and hauled out.

The carnitas inside were great.  The other toppings were great.  Too bad I could not bring myself to eat that NOT \"WELL DONE\" tortilla that wrapped this thing?  I just hauled out the pork and ate it atop some tortilla chips.

I ate half the chimi and had to leave the leftovers in a very warm auto in PHX to run some errands; so,  I pitched the leftovers.  No sense in challenging Fate?"}
{"text":"Salsa and chips beer tasty, but the meat in the taco salad didn't have very much taste and my wife said her spinach enchiladas weren't the best.  However, service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Our first choice for A pre valentines restaurant had an hour and a half wait, so we ended up here on feb 13th. No wait. Good service. Nice environment. Food was a 2.5. Chicken fried burrito, one of their most popular dishes according to the waitress was big, lots of cheese and good jalapeño cheese sauce. Wife had shrimp stuffed poblano chili. She liked it. The entrees were 3.5s but the beans were a 2 and the salsa was a zero. Tasted like canned tomatoes, no flavor. Chips were a 4.5. Prices were average for Mexican food. Bottom line, I'll never make this an intended destination."}
{"text":"This Nandos is always busy and poppin'!! Although it took a while to get a waitress at my table so I can put my order in & my food didn't come out very fast... The food is great tasting!!! I recommend this place if you have a lot of patiences!"}
{"text":"The best perk about this place is the chips, and salsa. The food was bland, and was lacking flavor, the beans tasted like they were from a can, and they were playing nickelback, and country music? This is a Mexican restaurant. I don't want to hear radio hits while I'm eating"}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar. Been here for 30 mins. Served drinks fairly quickly. Bartenders can't keep up. A guy came to help the lone girl bartender. Still haven't taken our dinner order, drinks are empty. Trying to get someone's attention to check out. Finally got his attention. Going elsewhere for dinner and won't be back."}
{"text":"Five family members got together at Nando's recently to honor our  patriarch's 83rd birthday. Not only was the food well prepared and tasty, but the joy and fun of our party were elevated by delightful conversations with our server CONNIE, who watched over us to guarantee that we had an extraordinarily celebratory eating-out experience."}
{"text":"+Yummy chips and salsa!
+Good food, muy delicioso and served hot.
+Service has always been excellent.
+Lovely decor.
+Good happy hour

-A little pricey on certain items.

This restaurant sticks out the most because of their sense of community. At the tragic and unforeseen death of a co-worker's relative, Nando's offered to donate their proceeds from one whole day toward the funeral costs. That was highly generous.

Give this place a try if you have a hankering for some good mexican food."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, poor service. Waiter was way too causal and inattentive at best. Haven't been there in years, won't be back. Way too many other better choices."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by someone who swore that it was the best around.  I had quite a different opinion.  Bland and boring food.  I ordered a black bean burrito.   I got a tortilla with dry black beans and shredded cheese, not even melted.  Rice was very plain as well.  Maybe I was supposed to smother it with their bland salsa but any way you put it, it was not good.  I won't be back again.  Being new to the area I thought I would give it a try.  I'll check the box on that one...with a note not to return."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes at our table before a bus boy to throw down (literally) cold chips and salsa. He spilled the salsa all over the table and himself. Walking away he shot shook it off his hands and never came back to clean his mess.  Had to ask another bus boy for water.  He dropped that off but never cleaned up the salsa mess.  Waiter finally came for our order. He took our order and left. Upon returning with our drinks we asked him to clean up the salsa. He acted as I'd he never saw it. You couldn't miss it! Finally that was cleaned up!! Salty food. Poor service. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"We had my wife's birthday party here, and had a party of about 30.  Everyone had a great time, and most of all, the Nando's staff made sure we were well taken care of.  Thanks to Gabby, Abby, Kim, and especially Will and Alex for a wonderful evening.  It wasn't our first visit, and certainly won't be our last!"}
{"text":"I grew up in what is now known as Central Phoenix, and I grew up eating at Manuel's (the original family location on Indian School). Nando's reminds me a lot of that and that is a very good thing. A lot of old school Arizona/Sonoran style recipes here. Good machaca, chicken tacos, green chili pork, and on and on. Also a good happy hour with a good tequila selection, and they carry one of my favorites - Bohemia beer which not all Mexican restaurants carry. Really like this place and it has become somewhat of a go-to choice for Mexican food on a weekend night."}
{"text":"The food was disgusting, the server was great. The \"salsa\" should have been a clue...tasted like they seasoned a can of tomato paste. Plate was hot, re fried beans were crunchy, flauta's were burned, my husbands burrito with \"steak\"was like chewing boot leather. Never again"}
{"text":"The chips are bland and tasteless. The gluten free menu consists of only 5 things when I know it would be very easy to create a gluten free meal with the help of a knowledgeable and courteous waiter or waitress. Not the case for me. So I settled for the naked taco salad for $10 and asked for a side of sour cream and had to pay extra for it. I checked the menu and they charge $10 for a regular taco salad which comes in a tortilla shell. So I'm confused here you take out the shell and charge the same amount and charge me for sour cream?? Overpriced, overrated gross food and whoever is in charge of the gf menu is lazy. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Very good. Fun, relaxing atmosphere. We ate from Texas and close to good, home cooked TexMex. Good job Nandos!  We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Nandos is OK and has what you would expect in a Mexican food restaurant. Not great but not bad just average but I still eat there a lot."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff but the food is really greasy and sub par. The service is really slow so good luck if its your weekday  lunch break."}
{"text":"First time visiting and we'll definitely be back. When was the last time you had chips & salsa left over? Tacos on Taco Tuesday are definitely recommended. You get three street tacos, beans & rice with pico and guacamole for $8; we couldn't finish everything. We'll be back on a Monday to try Margarita Monday, margaritas are $4 and Happy Hour Hump Day, happy hour is all day. 

Restaurant was clear and service was good! Give them a try, if you come across them."}
{"text":"The food is always great, but the cups and silverware are always very dirty. I won't go back to this location for this reason.  And margaritas aren't great here."}
{"text":"Went on a recommendation and it is probably my new favorite Mexican restaurant. Their chips are freshly made and delicious. They serve mild and hot salsa with it. Huge menu with many choices. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Yesterday while visiting a neighboring restaurant for a latte, I noticed Nando's. The restaurant itself is nice however Nando's needs to raise the bar on their food; quite bland, full of cheese and lacked dimension. I ordered the spinach enchiladas and added shrimp (up charge). I found two bites of spinach in the beginning and the portion size (small) was a surprise. I had added a mango margarita and was so-so. Guess I've been spoiled by La Casa Blanca (Chandler).

I visited Nando's in hopes to bring a work group activity here."}
{"text":"Never again will i spend a dime in this place.. food was cold, manager was immature, manager took a drink from my wife while she was drinking and said leave the resturant. . Employees where laughing like it was all funny... well know this nandos I will tell everyone i know About how and  who you hire to run this place. I will post on all social media I can find also.. I Belong to multiple car  clubs and i will spread the word on how this  place is ran... hope you make better management decisions in the future.. stay away from this place, it has gone down hill bad....."}
{"text":"The food is always so great and the service is always just as excellent. We've been coming here for years but tonight we had the best service we've ever experienced, Kordel is the most genuine server we've ever had, outstanding service."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town.  My wife and i have been going to Nando's for years and always try New Mexican restaurants but nothing compares!"}
{"text":"Decent food but the place needs a good cleaning, feels run down and dirty. Clean the place up a little, change to decor and lose the carpet in the dining area it's very dirty and carpet does not belong in a dining room. The food quality at this Nandos has gone down a bit. I would blame this on management, Even the wait staff says managers all have different ways of running the restaurant. This should be fixed, all managers need to be on the same page so everything works smooth. It's not rocket science, just common sense. Come on guys fix this place so I dont have to drive farther away to another Nandos."}
{"text":"Processed food but great environment.  Main thing I have an issue with is the servings are too big which most people would probably think is a good thing but I don't know, I guess I don't understand why anyone would want to order two full meals essentially.  Margaritas are great here though."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner while in town. Extremely good Mexican food! I had enchiladas. YUMMY! Chips and salsa was so tasty too! To bad I don't drink! The margaritas looked delicious as well. Will be back when I visit Arizona again!!"}
{"text":"Always good food. Normally good service. Plan on a short weight - normal 1/2 hour but worth it"}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday night & was busy. We ordered to go. We were told to order to go at the bar. After placing the other, sat there for 10-12 minutes n bartender was \"busy\" I was hoping to order a drink but she was done helping me and wouldn't even come/look my way. I didn't want to get frustrated, so just left and sat in the waiting area. I seen a bag of food come out and I was waiting for someone to call my name, instead it was placed on a table n left to sit there. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I didn't think it was mines... I go up n ask how much longer & sure enough that same bag was my food.
I was starting to get over this place, it's decor is beautiful but workers seem awful. The whole time I was waiting, not one waiter/waitress looked happy. Everyone looked overwhelm & upset. So I was hoping the food would make up for this.. I ordered the chicken chimichanga, and it was so bland. It wasn't even crispy and big chunks of chicken, not shredded.. There were even a few beef pieces in the chimichanga. The rice and beans were also very bland. I would of rather gone to a Filberto's than this place."}
{"text":"I placed an order for take out & was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. We arrived about 15 minutes later & waited at least another 20 minutes for our food. When we got home which is literally 2 minutes away if you catch all 2 stop lights, the queso was cold. I called to complain & the manager Rosie explained that I just need to put it in the microwave which was ever so helpful as it never occurred to me to use my microwave. (Hear sarcasm.) I explained to Rosie the point of take out is to eliminate food prep & this should have been explained. Ok...so I can heat the dip. However when we cut into our Pollo Rico entree it was also cold all the way through & the cheese had hardened on top as if it sat on a counter for a long period of time.

We returned the food & they returned our money so I have to say they did \"make it right\" but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I cannot believe it too me this long to eat here. I have eaten here twice and after the 2nd visit I am downgrading this from 4 stars to 3. 

Freshly made chips but the salsa is BAD. Whodathunk bad salsa at a Mexican place?

The cheese and green chili enchiladas are good but way too much cheese put on them plus way too much cheese on the nachos and its not nacho cheese which really makes the nachos really not very good."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food restaurant! Service is always great and food is always delicious. Always craving their cheese crisp. So excited I have a Nando's in my new neighborhood..."}
{"text":"A great local spot for good Mexican food. On our last trips to Mesa we were introduced to, and mafe a return trip to Nandos by relatives who live near by. My wife and I visited again last night and once again was not disappointed. We were seated promptly, our drink order was taken quickly, and chips and 2 salsas were served immediately. The chips @NANDOS is some of the best I've had being thin and browned to a perfect crisp. The salsas are delicious also, with one being \"mild\" the other being \"hot.\" We chose to share the Carnitas which comes with:  rice, beans, spicy guacamole and your choice of flour or corn tortillas. The Carnitas was tender, juicy and plentiful. The only complaint we had, was it could have had more flavor and less salt, but we didn't complain as we know any restaurant can be off occasionally. Another great meal, at a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Has got to be my favorite Mexican restaurant. Patio last night was just great and server SARA did an excellent job. Friendly and tended to business. Food is always good with huge portions and happy hour prices can't be beat. LOVE their HABANERO salsa - the spice of life!"}
{"text":"Pretty good little american-style mexican joint.

It's not authentic mexican, but not many places in the US are...but it's still decent grub. Not breathtaking! but fine.

The beans are good, meat is simmered and tasty, beer's cold, not many complaints to have.

I have only one gripe...the tables in the dining room are TINY! If there are more than two people sitting down, it is tight...just saying, it gets tight and you can hardly fit your dishes on top.

Everything else is fine, the bartender is a nice guy, servers are nice, it's not a bad place at all to come hang out. I like how it's a neighborhood spot, it's not pretentious or obnoxious, you just walk in, eat, and leave. Easy!"}
{"text":"We've ordered food twice at this location for take out and they have messed up our order both times. And both times they have over charged us. And frankly, the food is EXTREMELY blend - no flavors. The salsa they give with the chips for the take outs is probably they only thing that was good."}
{"text":"My husband and I went twice last week, and intend to return once a week until we move out of Gilbert. Hidden behind the Arby's across the street from Dana Park, we missed it the first time, but it's when we leave this area that we'll truly miss Nando's.

The menu is great, with plenty of classics and unique dishes. We were so pleased by the relatively large number of vegetarian items and learned from our very nice and helpful server Lisa that virtually any dish can be made vegetarian. Like Pollo Fundido (they call it Pollo Rico) but don't want the chicken? They'll fill the burrito with fajita veggies and potatoes instead. My husband had the Enchiladas Ongos (mushrooms with a chipotle cream sauce) and it was to die for. My Pollo Rico was huge, fresh, and outstanding. I've had better beans and rice, but they were fine. The second time we went, Bob had a veggie chimichanga and I had the Barrio Tacos. He really enjoyed his ginormous chimi, and my tacos were pretty good, but I have had more flavorful and tender carne asada elsewhere. 

On our first visit we had the cheese crisp, which came with a deep fried tortilla bottom and tons of good quality cheese on top. Delicious, but a little heavy. We decided that the second time we would save room for the chocolate nachos, and they turned out to be just ok- the concept was far better than the final execution. The chocolate tortilla chips were thick and the flavor was not what I had expected. 

The service was absolutely fantastic both times, and the atmosphere is very open and friendly. I love the wrought iron decor. The prices are reasonable for the portions, and they have the lime mints I love as you go out the door. Our first server told us that she has been with this restaurant since they opened- 6 or 7 years now. That says a lot about the people who run the place- they inspire loyalty in both their customers and their staff."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with friends who recommended it. The outside patio gets 5 stars especially with the fireplace going on a cool night. Margaritas were average not especially strong - as in sock it to me Don Julio! I ordered the Chile Colorado stewed meat with really tasty chunks of tender meat. Rice and beans were good. The chips can be improved upon,  but dang their habanero salsa is bomb diggity. Salsa in a carafe is so uppity,  but hell this is uppity Chandler so who can I blame? 

Tacos were tasty and crunchy. Service was outstanding and our kitchen ambassador was Gina. She was friendly and top notch taking care of all our needs. 

The only thing I was put off by, was the karate kid. This is the guy who owns a karate studio in the strip mall and is trying to drum up business outside Nando's restaurant. Although he was nice I don't want to be \"pitched\" to when I'm headed to dinner. Sorry Karate Kid. If you are the owner of nandos tell karate kid to scram and do his hustle somewhere else. If my kid needs karate, I know where your studio is. My \"drunken monkey\" Kung Fu  is superior to whatever karate your selling anyway."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food,better than most.went for lunch had enchilada,taco,rice n beans,definetly give you lots of food here folks and cheap.Chips n Salsa yummy.Worth the money and the drive,service was awesome also.Go getcha some!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of our favourite restaurants, but we have had problems with bills. On two occasions they have screwed us during happy hour. Once by seating us in a section that they informed us afterwards did not qualify for happy hour and next by upgrading our drinks without informing us that it doubled the price. The second time the waitress simply walked away when she was asked about our bill being almost double what we were expecting."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican place. The service is great, ambiance is nice, and it's very clean."}
{"text":"Really, really good. I've been a an of another chain Mexican restaurant in the area, but I think this place has it beat. 

Service is excellent. They do unobtrusive, yet efficient really well. 

Got our chips. They were just okay, salsa was just okay. It was sort of disappointing, but the food really made up for it. 

I order the taco/tostado/cheese enchilada plate and that first taste hooked me for life. How delicious! The cheese was really melt-y, but not super gooey, it wasn't overly cheesy weirdly. The only thing I can complain about is that the taco doesn't have vegetarian options, just meat. I should have asked for beans, but the tostado already had that covered. I saved that for last and the beans just melted the shell so I had to eat with my fork. I'll save that for first next time. 

My friend had the taco plate with the deep fried chicken taco and it looked really good. I didn't get beans and rice with mine, but he did so I tried them. Best I've ever tasted. Whew. 

This place is obviously awesome, you just need to get there and try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Nando's is nice because they give you a huuuuge complimentary serving of nachos pretty much immediately after you get seated. I normally refuse to go to expensive Mexican restaurants out of principle but I do enjoy going to Nando's. 


Their chimichangas actually have TOO much meat for me, and while I didn't like that, it's definitely not a problem for my boyfriend. I end up giving him all the extra meat. Everyone's happy.


I think my biggest reason for liking Nando's is how they load the plate up with veggies, sour cream, and cheese just smothered on top of whatever you ordered.


They have great service too! The parking lot can get crazy busy during peak dinner time - you have been warned!


One tiny gripe I have about the place is that the salsas served with the free nachos was kinda watery and I didn't really like it. Still, it's complimentary, so who am I to complain..."}
{"text":"Nando's is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the East Valley. You can't go wrong with Alfredo's green chile if you like spicy. Their queso dip is also my favorite because of the flour chips that come with it. The portions are huge and filling so go hungry. Other items I've tried include the beef and chicken tacos (both excellent) and the white pizza--it's huge so plan on sharing it or having leftovers. Margaritas are fresh and beer is cold too!"}
{"text":"Met up with the gang for a farewell to friends dinner, about 15 of us in all. Isaac our waiter handled us with style. The food was fabulous, I had the spinach enchildas which I've only had at one other place , amazing!  We shared two plates of nachos that looked like a volcano of cheese,chips and jalapeno goodness! There was so much food that everyone of us took a to go box couldn't eat another bite we were all so full! Of course I couldn't wait and dug back into my box later that night, to make sure it didn't disappear of course. I will definitely go back, but having dessert first to make sure I have room!"}
{"text":"I didn't know this location existed until suggested for dinner. When we walked in the place was packed, we were told the wait would be 10-15 minutes but within less than 5 we were seated.Brett our waiter quickly had chips, 2 kinds of salsa & drinks out and we were served our quesadilla appetizer in a matter of minutes. I ordered the Pollo Rico with jalapeno cream sauce, so good but so much that I got to take some home for lunch the next day, which turned into a midnight snack just too good to wait. I tried a bite of my son's Faja pasta dish, ordered that a few weeks later at another location. Even though we didn't finish our food we still shared the sopapillas, that came with whip, honey & chocolate sauce, messy but oh so worth it. Fabulous food & service, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We've been eating at this restaurant for about 2 years. We come about twice a month. Each visit has been excellent! The food is scrumptious and the service is friendly. They have a full bar and also cater."}
{"text":"Our families favorite restaurant.  We celebrate all our birthdays and special occasion there.  The food is the best Mexican in town.  We haven't had one thing we don't like. Awesome patio!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a solid Mexican restaurant. It has a very nice ambience and good Mexican food they serve them on extremely hot plates so everything is very warm."}
{"text":"Food is has been great every time we have been here. They are always busy. Pollo Rico is great. Both of there salsas are as well."}
{"text":"Just left Nando's after waiting 1 hour to get our food when no one was in there and when we complained the waiter he got short with us and brought us a bill for the soda! Terrible service really disappointed."}
{"text":"Twice in the past year I have had a small business function catered by Nando's and I remain extremely impressed with their outstanding food and service.  DELICIOUS!!  Reasonably priced.  I will definitely order Nando's again for our next function."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Nando's for years and still love it! The food is fabulous and the staff feels like family. My only complaint would be the wait time. There has been times where we have waited, during a busy rush, 45 minutes for a table but the food always came out hot and as expected. We will see you next time Nando's."}
{"text":"Good place for Margaritas, chips & salsa but food isn't authentic. Portions are large and priced well. They have a full bar with TVs and also outdoor seating with TVs. In the winter they have outdoor heat lamps and in the summer they have misters. Good place for large family and groups."}
{"text":"Great Salsa, Great Service... its a little tucked away and I saw it when I was passing by last week. I'm glad the wife and I stopped by. 
The Food:
I had the Fajita Philly and my wife had Chicken and Steak Fajitas. As far as Fajitas go, this is a great place to eat! We will definitely be returning to try other orders. The prices were not too bad either.
Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"This is the best sitdown Mexican restaurant we have found in the East Valley. We have never tried a bad dish here, and we can be quite the Mexican food snobs. The El Jefe f chimichanga always hits the spot, the flavor in the steak is amazing!  Plenty of flavor without the pitiful attempt to add taste  to the meat after cooking it with pico de gallo and other sauces, which other restaurants often try to pull off. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Food took forever, tacos were dried, beans were thick and chalky., chips and salsa tastes awful.  Will not go here  again."}
{"text":"Great food!   I love how they are so generous with chips and salsa right away!   Plus they have a pitcher of water on the table for you.  Great job Nando's!!"}
{"text":"I have never left a review before but this place was so horrible that it's worth a review.  I ordered 3 bean & cheese burritos (added rice in one) for pick up and it was horrible.  Everything was cold and everything literally tasted like it came straight  out of a can. How do you mess up bean & cheese burritos? My husband took one bite and threw it in the trash. I called to let the manager know how bad the food was and she didn't seem the least bit concerned in what I was saying. She even questioned what time I came to pick up the food implying it may have been cold because it was sitting a long time. Left hungry and out $16.00 for 3 crappy bean & cheese burritos.  Won't ever go  back...so disappointed. I would give zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Beef shreaded soft shell tacos with melted cheese was delicious.  Topped w rice and beans.  I will definately have this dish again!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Nandos on Cinco de Mayo. It was busy but we expected it to be. He started feeling bad and was having a hypoglycemic attack. I went to the bar and got him a Coke from the AMAZING bartender-I didn't get his name-but I really want to thank him for getting it to me quickly!! My friend started feeling better after he drank the Coke. We were seated shortly after and had a delicious dinner! Thank you so much again!"}
{"text":"Such a great place! Great atmosphere awesome customer service and the food is authentic and delicious. Thank you Nandos!"}
{"text":"Went there today to enjoy a lunch and almost walked out...A family allowed their kid to run around the place, screaming and  throwing a fit and they SAT THERE AND MUNCHED ON CHIPS....this kid sat on the floor and screamed...and they did nothing...Mom got up once, to show off her platform shoes and shorts so  tight, you could see the outline of her Vagina....Where was the MGR? He ran to the kitchen when the kid started to scream..NO BALLS...
We have been going there since it opened but NEVER AGAIN....

I will miss their great food, and service, but I DO NOT WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED BY YOUR KID!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and some old friends love this place and have them cater their parties all the time. I've had tacos and enchiladas, but the Pollo Rico (crispy chicken burro with jalapeno cream cheese and cheddar cheese) is by far my favorite. 

The food here tastes lighter than most Mexican food places."}
{"text":"Went there last week and I was pleasantly surprised. The green chili plate was fantastic!! This was my first visit and I look forward to going back for some more"}
{"text":"Clean place, service is hit & miss and food is very pricey compared to most Mexican restaurants we frequent. Mostly come here on Saturdays mornings for their special on bloody Mary's! I do like that they offer potatoes & beans instead of rice with their breakfast menu!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in the area.  Generous portion, served hot and delicious.  Shaunte was our server and did a great job explaining the menu and options....very helpful.  Give it a try you will not be disappointed...two locations one in Gilbert and one in North East Mesa."}
{"text":"We came here after the other Mexican place we wanted to go to was closed and ended up having a great dinner! I went in with no expectations since it was so last minute, but loved all of it. The waitress was personable and had some solid recommendations, the margarita was awesome, we loved our dishes and the atmosphere was nice for a quick little date night.

I had an enchilada and taco, my fiancée had a burrito and both were delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Considering that the restaurant is kind of hidden I was shocked when I came here on a Wednesday night and saw that the place was so packed!

Everyone I was with LOVED the food. To me it was good, but I agree with some of the comments I read below, there is so much cheese in everything and it feels so unhealthy when eating it. 

The portions are so huge!! One dish can feed at least 3 people, it's ridiculous!

Nice staff, pretty decor, and the drinks are strong --- I would come here again, probably just for drinks though :)"}
{"text":"Izzy is always with a smile and friendly fast service.  He knows that we come in at lunch and gets us in and out quickly but with great service even when extremely busy."}
{"text":"Always get great service here!  We usually take a table in the bar section & get seated right away.  Good chips & salsa.  Great margs & my husband loves that with a shot of premium tequila a little mini corona beer is included.  Good food at good prices.  Try the Pollo Rico!"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE Mexican food fan and my husband and I love trying new Mexican Food Restaurants. This one is walking distance from my house so we decided to give it a try. 

I only gave 3 stars because I was just not a fan of the food. The service was great and staff was very nice. I was just displeased with the food. 

We even tried multiple items on the menu and we gave it 2 more chances by going back twice more. And we still were not satisfied with the food taste. 

Even though it's convenient location for us we will be traveling further to try some different tastes!!"}
{"text":"Monday was quite a day of day drinking and eating.  Mr. M & I had already hit two other places and then we decided to head much closer to home and try Nando's.  I've been curious since they started remodeling the place, and driving by at night the white lights on the patio & inside looked very inviting.

This location is exactly that:  inviting and even though the building is large, there are smaller rooms inside and the brick interior makes it feel cozy.  The staff could not be more friendly.  I think I saw everyone smiling which is always appreciated.  We started with 2 of the Cabo margs with curacao which were large and delicious.  The chips and salsa were good too.  I used to think I liked my salsa more like pico de gallo, but now I'm gettin' into the salsas that are more of a puree.  Nando's salsa had a very nice blend of flavors.  They gave us the mild/medium one, and then a small container of salsa they said was very spicy.  We're both a couple of heat pansies and didn't try that one, but it smelled good.

Then Mr. M had the Pollo Rico and I had the #10 which was with 2 beef flautas, black beans, and rice.  Now I know this isn't really authentic but both dishes were flavorful and enjoyable.  Both meats, the chicken in the Rico and the beef in my flautas were very tender.  As others have mentioned the portions are HUGE.  We left with mucho leftovers which I'm always happy to warm up the morning after and throw a fried egg on top of.  And I froze all the Spanish rice and will use that in a tex mex soup that I make.

I mentioned in another review today that I've been having major cravings for Mexican food lately and this place fit the bill.  I would definitely go back mainly because the atmosphere is so inviting and because it's a good value for the money.  They also do flights of tequila.  I will most definitely be back to try some of those.  Glad to see a Mexican joint within walking distance.  Or shuffling distance."}
{"text":"I have been here several times in the past 3 years. This place has the best Mexican food I have tasted. Their Salsa and Chips are great. They have amazing Cheese Enchiladas that are very cheesey, melted well and taste very good. The place is very clean I never spot a single spot of dirtiness on the tables. The inside and out are both pretty. The Waiters and Waitresses are nice and well managing. The food comes out quickly and the sides like rice, lettuce & tomatoes are very fresh. The Guacamole and Sour Cream they have is the most fresh I have had. Every Serving I have had there I have never had a concern, ever. I have never had there Dessert but I am ready to try it soon. Looking for the best Mexican food in the valley? you've found the right review."}
{"text":"The cheese crisp! You must order this so cheesy! Everything else that they serve are supersize so share"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice. Both times the nachos were terrible! The cheese was like chewing a rubber tire both times. The wait staff are not observant at all. I had to ask for more water, chips, soda, as our waitress walked by and looked at our table. Recently the waitress just got our order incomplete or wrong. I've given this place two tries and will never return!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch here today and I can't say enough how good everything was. I had chicken enchiladas and they were so fresh with great flavor. The chicken was high quality white breast. The tortilla chips were also great and come before your meal.

Something that I couldn't get over was how great the restaurant smelled from the aroma of food when I first walked in. The next time I'm visiting Mesa I will make sure I come back."}
{"text":"After reading a lot of good reviews for Nandos's, we decided to try it out back in April with high hopes of a very tasty meal.

Well.....that didn't happen. Like most Mexican food places, we started off with chips and salsa. The salsa was extremely bland. Would not be surprised if I found Costco sized bottles of Pace in the trash bin. Even went so far as to try out the Habanero salsa in hopes of a good spice. Tasted a little better than the regular but was still not spicy at all. Major disappointment.

But not as sad as our dinner. We decided to split the El Jefe Chicken Chimichanga. Like the salsa, was flavorless, filled with onion, and no spice. And the chicken looked and tasted like Fry's $5 rotisserie chicken after two microwave reheats. Depressing... Only redeeming quality was the atmosphere and satisfactory service. May give Nando's another try but won't be holding my breath."}
{"text":"We are from New Mexico and live close by this Nandos and thought we would give it a shot. Meh it's ok. Last month we went and first off there was lipstick on the glasses and couple of plates in table had food residue on them. Second there was a fly in our pitcher of water. Yuk! So about 3 weeks later we decide to give it another try. Well what do we find on one of the glasses on table LIPSTICK Again! So this time I call manager over there. He was nice enough guy but his response was it's the plastic cups they use. Are you kidding me! I go tons of places w the plastic cups and no lipstick... He said they run through cycle but they still have the stains and sometimes just can't get them off. Says it happens a lot. What a joke! I'm guessing the food left in the GLASS plates is same issue hmmmmmm! We will just stick w our fav Mexican spot Si Senors in Chandler. It's worth the drive! Also there \"happy hour\" specials only exist if sitting in bar area or patio.. Big thumbs down."}
{"text":"For the longest time this restaurant has been a childhood favorite; still to this day it is by far my favorite Mexican food restaurant. Even though I cherish this restaurant it still has its flaws. The water isn't very good in my opinion and the service could be a little quicker. Other than that this is some of the best Mexican food in town! I come to Nando's all the time and I would recommend it to first time visitors for some good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Worst place too  eat service sucked to food was worse. I'm not a yelper I looked at the reviews thought  I'll give it a try that was a mistake. this restaurant does not even look like a Mexican restaurant.  food is horrible service stinks go somewhere else that has better food better service"}
{"text":"Their food is good but their breakfast place, Nando's Hideaway...is the BEST!  Get the green chile pork and eggs. I also tried the Hangover Burger once (yes, it's a breakfast). It was HUGE.....next time, I'll pull the ham off...."}
{"text":"Darn food food in a fun but classy atmosphere. Some of the better Mexican food I've had in Mesa since we lost Matta's on Main. Lunch specials are a great deal. Salsa is pretty tasty. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my family has been eating at Nando's for quite a few years.  We've visited both the Gilbert and East Mesa locations and seem to have the worst service experiences at the Gilbert restaurant.  We really enjoy the food, though they do occasionally have an off night where the entrees aren't hot enough or some other faux pas, like forgotten items, wrong orders etc.
We visited the Gilbert location this afternoon for an early dinner and as usual the place was busy.  Not packed...but filling up.
We were seated immediately by the Hostess and the server that brings chips and salsa arrived shortly thereafter.  Pleasant and courteous as usual.
Here is where the wheels fell off.  The server for that particular area was nowhere to be found and the section was quite full.  We noticed several tables in some state of waiting, for their meals, drink refills, paying the check, etc.  The mental time clock started at that point.  There was a table of 3 seated across from us and had been there long enough to eat a good amount of chips...although they had no drinks other than the water pitcher that resides on every table.  Clearly they had been seated for some time.  We waited no less than 10 minutes before we saw our server for the very first time.  He greeted us and informed us he'd \"be right back\".  
He attended to his other guests and was looked upon like a long lost relative who hadn't been heard from for years.
While we waited, another table of 2 was seated next to us and received their chips and salsa quickly.  Another 5 minutes passed and the server showed up to take drink/dinner orders from us first.  We informed him the table across from us had been waiting much longer than we had and he should help them first, which he did.  He then attended to us and then the table of 2 next to us.  Keep in mind these folks had only just arrived minutes earlier.
Ultimately, all orders were taken.  Can you guess which table was served their food first...that's right...the table of 2 that had been waiting the shortest amount of time.  The table of 3 was next...we, unfortunately came in dead last when our food arrived 5 minutes later.  
To give you and idea of how much time passed from being seated to actually seeing a plate of food in front of us...50 minutes!  Entirely too long for Mexican food of any quality.
We are strongly considering this visit to be our last.  An unfortunate situation that could easily be remedied by proper training and communication among the staff."}
{"text":"Great food , huge portions , reasonably priced. Love this Mexican restaurant. 
It's too busy Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"Ordered the blanco mx pizza and it was awesome!  The environment is cool and casual and we love the tacos!  Good service too!"}
{"text":"Well we went back. We couldn't resist because it's our favorite. Shared the Barrio taco dinner and and had margaritas. Delicious. We still love Nando's."}
{"text":"I feel like this place is a hidden gem. It's really yummy, fresh food. I especially like the enchiladas, which usually isn't my first choice at Mexican restaurants, but they are so good here. Get them with green sauce."}
{"text":"I've visited off-and-on since opening.  Having tried several items, from \"specialties\" to \"combo platters,\" I have to say that their offerings aren't anything to write home about.  They're not horrible, but far from impressive.  The portion sizes are right, the chips and salsa are okay.  Although I love me some guacomole, I'm not a big fan of theirs.  If you're looking for some mexican food that's just decent and filling, Nandos will suffice."}
{"text":"We are here having breakfast this morning. I love this place. :) always clean great food friendly staff!!!"}
{"text":"Dined with large group for late dinner.  Waiter was friendly and helpful. Large basket of corn chips with salsa.  The menu is extensive and at least ten different margarita choices. I had the popular house margarita which was good and definitely could taste the tequila. Grilled chicken salad was great.  The salad greens were fresh and crispy and there was a generous portion of chicken.  Had the chipotle dressing which was served on the side, was delicious, creamy and not overly spiced. You have two choices of dressing, the other choice would be a jalapeno dressing.  Friend had the steak fajitas and asked for med rare. The meat was slightly overcooked.  Another had the shrimp fajitas but had to ask to have the shrimp grilled a little longer.  The restaurant took care of them very well and adjusted their dishes with courtesy and I was impressed.  My husband had the seafood enchiladas and really enjoyed them as well.  The portions for all the dishes were large and satisfying. So if your hungry you still might leave with leftovers. I would recommend this restaurant.  The only criticism would be the low set hanging lights which we could bump our heads on. (Though to be fair, they had to combine tables for our large group which placed the lights in inconvenient locations.)"}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food and great staff. Tena in the bar is drop dead gorgeous and is by far one of the best things going for this place!"}
{"text":"Visiting family in the Mesa area, we told them we wanted some good Mexican food.  This was what they recommended.  The wait staff were friendly and efficient, but that's where the 5 stars stopped.  First, the margaritas were way too sweet, so I switched to wine, which was a bit pricier.  The chips on the table were stale, and the salsa was meh.  Everyone at the table ordered different dishes, and they seemed to think they were 'okay', but my Chimichanga was way too salty, too doughy, and had hardly any sauce on it.  But the portion size was enormous, so I suppose that's a plus.  I was very disappointed.  There HAVE to be better Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican place! Food is great. I love the chips and salsa. The service is always great and they are very good at speedy service and refilling items as needed. Sign up for their email club and they send out occasional coupons. My husband begs to go here."}
{"text":"I've been three times now and they have all been solid visits.  On my last visit I had steak fajitas as part of the 99 days of Summer deals, this one is available on Saturdays.  The deal was good and the fajitas were great.  When severed on a hot plate you expect it coming out sizing, otherwise what's the point.  Nando's hit it just right, not only with my order but with the many going out to dining room.  The setup included; rice, beans topped with cheese, lettuce, diced tomato, and black olive garnish. On the side  were two large warm thin flour tortillas wrapped in foil, along with side cups of guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gallo. The Saturday deal includes two house margaritas, and the fajitas. It's a great deal to begin with, but which drives it over the top is that you get garnish setups for two. Meaning two full plates of all side items I mentioned and two tortilla packs. There was plenty of food for two hungry adults. The steak was some of the best fajita steak I've had in a long time.  I can't wait to have it again.  I almost forgot to mention, our waitress was excellent!"}
{"text":"Sorry family but.....Nando's is Nada!   An extreme exercise of the gluttonous Gilbert Arizona restaurant fest.  Same typical timeline: after fighting for a spot in an overfilled parking lot, push through the huge crowd standing (hardly enough seats) in the hot lobby to hear that it will take 30-40 minutes to be seated (after it takes them 5 minutes to figure that out), then try to stay awake while sitting among people staring at the wall and kids running around.  Finally get seated and given cavernous Diet Cokes (standard) and chips (which you eat the whole bottomless basket of since you are waiting so long).   The waitress looks busy as hell and takes another 30 minutes to take our order, meanwhile I drink 4 diet cokes.  Already having comsumed enough calories for 2 people, the main meal arrives:  my \"fish tacos\" are 6 mini strips of tough fish laid in less-than-fresh tortillas, with 80% of the rest of the plates filled with cheese, beans, and rice.  I have had better Mexican at hole-in-the wall joints at 3am.   This time we ordered the fried ice cream for dessert, one order of which was big enough to feed the entire table.   As the night went on I glanced around and noticed that the average BMI in the place was around 32.   I would be the same if I did this place even once a week....."}
{"text":"Very very sad at the quality of the food at this Nandos. We love the Nandos on McDowell road. The plates are served with extra nice touches and look great as they come out. The food at the location of valvista and baseline was so substandard. I was sad at my 'usual' tasting dry inside and I am not sure why my sauce had a yellow tinge to it. The staff was very friendly and the establishment appeared clean."}
{"text":"My first visit here!  I love to find new places especially those hidden from sight like Nandos. Today i tried the lunch special. A beef Taco and cheese enchilada. it was pretty much what I expected, but in a good way!
The other yelp reviewers had given it pretty much a thumbs up and I think they were spot on. iI's typical texmex, but really well done. The portions are generous and the food was well prepared and presented. 
It was actually much more than I could possibly eat. So I was not disappointed, BUT I was not enchanted either."}
{"text":"This place is very much American-style \"Mexican\" food. Not terrible by any means, but probably not the best choice for those who are looking for something more authentic or like spicier food. We both ordered the combo #4 (burro, taco & cheese enchilada). I ordered both items with chicken, hubby got carne Asada. Both were ok but not nearly spicy enough for our tastes (for reference, we love Blue Adobe, Los Ds, and green chili burros at Burrito Express) Pricing is pretty good, comparable to most anywhere else."}
{"text":"Ive been to Nando's Chandler location many times with my daughter and son in law as they live in the neighborhood and frequent Nando's weekly.  We have always had good service and good food, however my visit this evening was anything but good.  I was dining alone and sat at a table in the bar.  The server took my order, brought my beer, and that was the last time I saw him. Somebody else brought my meal, which was fine, but nobody ever came back to check if I needed anything and when I was finished, I waited 20 minutes before I requested my check and a box from the hostess, who could not have been less interested. She was far more interested in chatting with the other hostess and acted totally put off by my request. I would guess that my immediate and extended family spends close to $1500 a month at Nando's, and because they are regulars have always been treated well.  Not the case tonight for me. Very disappointed that I was made to feel so unwelcome."}
{"text":"Have had three 4-star experiences here in the past in terms of both food and service. Came here on a Sunday for lunch and they dropped the ball, big time. Took 25 minutes to get a waiter (not even the waiter who greeted us and brought drinks) to take our order in the back corner booth. Food took another 15 minutes to get out to us. Diving in the food was slightly crusted over, plates were scorching hot leading me to believe these were thrown in an oven to reheat prior to bringing out. We had three different ppl tend to us all of whom saw us about twice each and then bailed. Terrible experience, and we won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Very tasty Mexican food. Large portions and the different salsas were great. Especially with the crispy tortilla chips. Service was fine and food did taste good. Place was packed during lunch so had to try it. I'd go back or try the one closer to where I live."}
{"text":"One of our favorite go-to places. 
So many yummy things on the menu, but splitting the combo platter (appetizer) lets both of you try several different things. 
Delicious, cheap date. :)"}
{"text":"Nandos! A name worth shouting... And Shout I will!

I remember finding this place by coincidence about 3 years ago and after having an amazing lunch I forgot where it was! So, I was getting my car cleaned oat the car wash on Val Vista and Baseline and as I drove around the back I saw the sign... NANDO'S...  and it all came back... I Found IT!!!!

Honestly, I couldn't wait to tell the wife so I picked up the phone and said \"Honey, get in the car and meet me for lunch\" and she did just that.

We split the Fajitas. They are amazing. The meat *chicken and beef) were so tender (I hate tough) and the flavors and freshness of the food filled this ol' mans belly to the brim. I was in fatso heaven!

Heres the bottom line, I have tried numbers items now after my rediscovery and can tell you that the food is great and the portions are gargantuan. If you fill up pretty fast, split a plate. If you eat a big meal, order separately.

The only thing I was not a fan of was the Guacamole and the Chili Relleno. The Guacamole, well... Its the old whipped Guac' recipe But.... it's edible. The Relleno is too full of cheese. Would you like some Chili Relleno with your mound of hot gooey cheese? No Thank You...

Other than those two items, I think you will be really happy with the rest of the menu. Chicken appears to be all white meat too. I'm always a fan of white chicken meat.

Bon' Appetite! Did I just use French in a Mexican restaurant review? Ay Carumba!

~Stew~"}
{"text":"Starving? Look no further than Nando's this place isn't cheap when it comes to portions as all their plates are always loaded with beyond enough food. Prices are more than fair and food isn't so bad. I really like their chips here and the salsa well that's more for the gringos but its still not bad. Some of my favorite lunch specials are the chicken fajitas, chorizo con huevos, and their tacos are really good as well. Overall great lunch spot."}
{"text":"At first we were seated under a tree, but after my fingers became covered in bird poop, our hostess eagerly sat us somewhere else. The chips and salsa were excellent as was the chimichanga I ordered. The portion size was great for the price and I ended up taking half of my meal home with me. Our service, however, was lacking. Our waiter only stopped by once to take our order, once to drop it off and once with the check. And the times in between were LONG. My sister had a margarita, so I figured he would be by more frequently at least to try to bank on selling her more drinks, but no. Once we finished our meal, we sat there for nearly 30 minutes waiting for him to come back. It was a Wednesday and the restaurant was completely empty inside, so while I'd like to say he was busy, I really can't say what he issue was. I'd go back for the food, though, because I'm sure it was just an off day for service."}
{"text":"Brandon is a wonderful bartender.  Great margaritas and food.  Great chicken tacos and quest dip.  Fireplace outside"}
{"text":"We frequent Nando's and love their food. You get a large portion and complimentary chips. Yesterday afternoon we went for lunch/dinner and the service was slow, it took nearly 30mins to get our food after ordering. (It wasn't super busy either; there wasn't a wait to be seated) Also, I asked for a substitute and they up charged a ridiculous amount without advising, which is  disappointing. I spent about $20 on a $12ish Chicken Flauta meal all because I asked for a side salad, which was literally only lettuce and shredded cheese, instead of the rice and beans and queso on my flauta instead of guac, sour cream, or cream cheese. --that's my normal meal there and normally they sub for no additional charge, just depends on the waiter I guess. Overall, we like their food and will return!"}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Yum!  

Friends introduced us to this place - they're regulars and we may be too.  It's a hidden place, but once you find it you are welcomed into a gorgeous restaurant with plenty of space.  

They have a good sized drink menu, and my first \"Yippee!\" happened when I saw they had choices for margaritas that didn't include syrup and sweetness that you can get with margarita mixes.  I could actually taste (and later feel!) the tequila.  

My second \"Yippee!\" happened when I was informed that the Chile con Queso was (gasp) vegetarian!  It was absolutely delicious and hot and if I wasn't watching my athletic figure I would have chowed down on it and the thick chips that go with it.  

My third \"Yippee!\" happened when I saw black beans on the menu.  Black beans that are lard free!  My black bean and cheese burrito was amazing - not too greasy, just the right amount of cheese.  They also had more vegetarian choices, and I'll have to try the Spinach Enchiladas one of these days.  

Loved everything about this place - will definitely be back!  But not on Tuesdays, since I'm not interested in seeing kids eating free."}
{"text":"Two things on the menu that I always order the chicken nachos or the carne asada salad both are enough to feed at least two to three people and are very fairly priced the jalapeno ranch dressing is absolutely the bomb"}
{"text":"Great Margaritas and Happy hour! Salsa is lacking flavor and the shredded cheese they use is rubbery, Overall good food tho:)"}
{"text":"Birthday party on the patio. Server struggled with service all night. Will not recommend this restaurant.Very slow with drinks Right away he said they didn't have ingredients for the special ? Get Lucky Margarita. We always had to flag him down to reorder drinks. He didn't tell us about happy hour special for appies but someone had been there before and told us about them. 2 dinners arrived and they were 3/4 finished before the rest of the table was served their meal. Food was okay. No offer of coffee or after dinner drinks. While we had cake that somone provided all the dishes remained on the table until we asked for them to be removed and give us a to go box. The bills were a nightmare. Lots of mistakes and no portable card machine. Will not return and won't recommend"}
{"text":"This has been a family favorite for a while, The place is cute, the food is always good and I have no complaints! The Pollo Rico is HUGE (like 3 meals huge) and probably a million calories, but totally worth it. Margaritas are yummy too."}
{"text":"I really don't reccomend this restaurant. First of all the service was terrible. He brought us our food and didn't come back until he dropped the bill on the table without asking if we wanted dessert or anything. We also ate the first basked of chips fast because we were all very hungry and did not get offered a second basket even though it was another 20 minutes until our food came. My husband needed a refill on his drink for 20 minutes and never got it. The food was mediocre. The chicken in my 'pollo Rico' tasted just like boiled chicken with no flavor. I'm pretty sure the beans are canned and they tasted like glue. The rice is not authentic Mexican rice, but was better than the beans. I can't believe we wasted $45 on this meal, we will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Defiantly not the best Mexican food. Pollo Rico was dry. Chips and salsa tasted like pace."}
{"text":"Love this place, authentic Mexican food! The green chili pork is amazing. Must try if your in Gilbert"}
{"text":"Wow we have been going here for 14 years, we have had birthdays here, company meetings, and family and friends in town. I have never had a server and a manager explain to you that it was your problem the way you ordered it. My daughter ordered a burrito and it came and was wrong told the server and he said it was half gone you said it to late. I met my family there 40 min late and my wife received her dinner with mine. They charged $5.00 more for my wife's plate then my daughters and it was the same thing. Nando I am a business owner also and I know it's hard to find good people, but if this was the only way we were treated we would never come back. I was upset last night and told the manager I would fire everyone and start over. But I know the customer is not always right but tell your servers and managers not told argue with your customers and say it's their fault. We received 20 % off which still is not right when orders came late and orders were wrong. This is not good business and I hope you make it and can turn it around. Best of luck"}
{"text":"Chimichanga consisted of dry white meat that taste like week old Costco rotisserie chicken and service shoved the receipt into my arms as if they were ready for us to leave. Probably only good thing is the unlimited chips but even those are so-so. Last time I'm coming here"}
{"text":"Food was okay, service took a little longer then I would like but, the place was pretty good."}
{"text":"I will say that I've had mixed experiences at this restaurant.  Unfortunately more miss than hit.  The salsa is good, the chips salty and fresh.  I had lunch there today, and for me this is the last time I will visit this establishment. The food is not authentic, that's not the issue.  The problem is that the food they do serve is underwhelming and utterly devoid of seasoning. It's terribly bland, and in some instances watered down and soggy."}
{"text":"My family went here when we were in this area. I like the decor, it was nice. The food was just okay, nothing spectacular. The service also was just okay. It kind of took a while for the waiter, then for our food. They aren't super expensive, affordable."}
{"text":"I had \"el numero cinco\" (green enchiladas) which were pretty good. Hubby had the \"Picado Dinner\" which he felt was on the bland side. Nice evening except for the sweeping/vacuuming frenzy that went on for about 15 minutes  just after our food arrived. I thought I might get some extra chewies flicked into my plate from the broom activity.  Rude to say the least."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mexican food place!  Their tacos are amazing.  They're so creative with their margarita ideas.  I would recommend just about anything on the menu.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Spinach enchilada was awesome! My friend had mushroom enchilada that was great too! Highly recommend this cafe."}
{"text":"The only thing I can recommend here is the fajitas and drinks.  All of there other dishes are drenched in too much cheese and sauce to have any real flavor.  The atmosphere and service is great though."}
{"text":"Nothing special.. I had the taco, enchilada and burrito platter. Pretty bland meat and the amount of cheese was a bit much.. And I seriously. Love. Cheese. It was nice to have two different salsas at the table and the service was good.. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing..?"}
{"text":"Seated promptly even though there were a lot of people waiting. The food is nothing to write home about... The food was pretty bland. I did like how they gave me two different salsas on the table for your choosing. Not sure I will be going back to this one since this was my second try with the second type of meal and I still was not impressed"}
{"text":"Takeout ordered- food was great, no complaints here on portion size and quality. Only flaw was one of the orders was messed up."}
{"text":"Nando's is a great lunch spot! I was here for the first time to have lunch with my mom on her break. The waitress was very nice, paid attention to our table, and made sure our food got to us fast! I was impressed with the speed and quality of service, the food wasn't bad either!"}
{"text":"My co-worker and I have been coming here for years now every Friday for lunch.  We both love this place!  All of the servers we have had have been good but we especially love Christina and ask to sit in her section.  She never leaves us needing anything.  She even remembers what we like to drink and most of the time will walk to greet us with drinks in hand.  The food is really good.  I change it up quite a bit because I like variety.  Most of the time I will get a cheese enchilada with rice and black beans.  Their black beans are excellent with a great flavor.  I have also had the Pollo Rico several times.  I have them add the cream cheese sauce in the inside also because if not, it tends to be a little dry for my taste.  The nachos with chicken are great but they are HUGE so unless you are really hungry or like leftover nachos, bring a friend or two to share with you.  I'm talking for an entree if you were having it as an appetizer I would say share it with at least 5 people.  Their lunch combos are a great deal.  Of course the meal starts out with their fresh chips and salsa.   They have salsa that is mild and a little chunky then smooth sauce that is a little hotter.  I mind both of them together in the bowl provided.  After all that if you have saved any room for dessert, the fried ice cream is delicious.  We always say one day we are just going to go there for chips, a cheese crisp (which are also great) and dessert.  

As far as large parties, we had my daughters graduation lunch here.  There were about 40 people and we sat on the patio.  It was plenty of space.  I reserved it about a month ahead of time.  Since the party was at lunch time we were able to order off the lunch menu.  It was nice because they put together a custom menu that just listed the food and not the prices.  It even had her name in it.  

I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that is looking for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Average American/Arizona Mexican food.

Do all the basic dishes but along the lines Garcias or Sorranos.

Just another in the same class of Mexican."}
{"text":"Best cheese crisps in Arizona! And I love love love the green chili enchiladas ... I prefer chicken! YUM!! Thanks for the great service too, everyone is so friendly!!"}
{"text":"Another great place that my wife turned me on to.  Lots of tasty options on the menu.  Not to mention the great chips and salsa that they serve you upon arrival.  The services is fast and friendly as well."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food! Order the flour chips instead of the regular chips, no extra charge... So so good!"}
{"text":"Kyle is the best server anywhere..
Always remember us. What we wanted.
And it's always a special order too..
He works in the bar area Thursday through Sunday..
Good food. Relaxed setting.
Say hi to Kyle and watch TV if so desired."}
{"text":"Good spot for Mexican food. You have to order the shredded chicken tacos....the best. I've also had the enchiladas and what a delightful dish. Loaded with chicken and beans very flavorful. Nando's do not hold back on portions, trust me you will get full.  Chips and salsa is good, I will look for feedback on what you thin about the chips and salsa. The place is clean, solid price points, and the wait staff is friendly. Yesssss Mister!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. The drinks were great but food didn't have a ton of flavor. The overall service wasn't that great. Some of the employees looked like they hated their job. Never once smiled. I expected it to be better for the price of the food."}
{"text":"I have a friend that lives in Gilbert that swore by this place. So, I happened to be visiting an electronics repair place in Gilbert, and I just thought I would stop by and see what the fuss was all about.

First of all, surrounding area is okay. Although, not something I was expecting in Gilbert. The interior is clean and spacious - nicely done.

The food portions were certainly generous enough.

That is the extent of positives that I have to say about this place. 

I ordered the #6 Combo Red Burro, enchilada style with Rice only, and I added a taco for good measure and comparison.

My summation: the Spanish rice needed more flavor, the meat in the taco was undercooked, and the cheese and vegetables didn't taste fresh at all. And the server seemed like she was very put out to take my order, and was very slow to refill my drink.

If it weren't for the aforementioned positives during the introduction of this review, I would've given them one star.

I am not sure what my friend was thinking, but his taste buds may need further acclimation to better Mexican food options."}
{"text":"This small chain knows how to deliver great service in a fancy, fun atmosphere. Try the greenchile beef burrito alacart or order the combo number 9 and feast  like el chapo."}
{"text":"Omg what an unorganized group , people waiting for tAbles and people finished eating waiting for the tables to be cleared and given there bill. The staff seams to wonder aimlessly not knowing what to do next. Either they are understaffed or have a lack luster manager to direct. Food here is normally good , but the frustration of watching this staff in action is painful that being said when we finally  got a table  i had to flag down our server to place the order more frustration the food actually showed up in a reasonable time frame and was hot and tasty.we normally go early but we had friends visiting so we showed around 9 am i dont think we left untill 1045ish. it wasnt just me i we were getting ready to leave another guy was complaining about the service. though the food was good and the server was friendly i still muster up 3 stars"}
{"text":"We have been going to Nando's Mexican Cafe for years, and it is great! They have excellent chicken fajitas and machaca burritos. And they are definitely not stingy  with their complimentary chips. A must try!"}
{"text":"nice place, spacious, good decor. Attentive, considerate waitperson. Attractive menu - lots of choices. Complimentary chips (really good) with salsa - all of which are hot - good but spicy. Just FYI. The prices were ok, a bit high - lunch for 2 with one beer, one appetizer, tax & tip = the high side of the $40 range. There was a lot of food, enough for 3-4 more average size meals. We had the shrimp chimi app - ok although I wondered afterwards why - I should have known it would be tiny (probably canned) shrimp. Nice to find on a menu though. MH had the carne asada chimi - flavorful and large. It was ok. As for me, I really didn't like my meal size (ok, who am I kidding - it was HUGE) chicken chimichanga. I'm not an expert of Mexican food by any means but I've had this dish before. There's got to be more to it than putting bite size (not really shredded) white chicken inside - really, that's all there was, no cheese, sour cream, salsa mixed with it - it was incredibly dry. If these are your favorite, ask about this first, imo. Maybe it was just the way I got it, but I wasn't impressed. It left me with a lot of retro-prep work on the leftovers. I might go back, but I doubt it ..."}
{"text":"Yes! Go here!

The best chips & salsa in the Valley. Hearty portions of quality and delicious Mexican food. Friendly, helpful, top-notch service (ask for Isaac, if he's working). Nice ambiance too. This could be my new favorite Mexican food restaurant.

I've tasted and can recommend: Huevos Rancheros, Machaca Taco, Red Beef Burro, Chorizo Burro. And, like I said, the chips & salsa(s) are amazing.

I'm a fan. I'll return."}
{"text":"Have you guys tasted your water? Clearly not, otherwise you would have added or changed a filter. It taste disgusting!"}
{"text":"One of my FAVORITE place to eat!! I live on this side of town and if I need to find something to eat and can't decide Nando's is the place!! I love everything from the cheesiest enchiladas ever to their Hatch green chili burrito. Very proud to call this restaurant my go to place!!"}
{"text":"This is a hard review for me.....I eat here all of the time as well as their location off of Power Rd and McDowell. I like the food and would recommend their cheese enchiladas to anyone but I'm not a huge fan of their salsas and that bothers me because in a Mexican restaurant it has to start with the salsa. Now don't get me wrong I like it but it could be much better. Same goes with the chips. Half of the time I go the chips taste stale and are greasy. The food is great and the staff is awesome and I really enjoy this place which is why I eat here quite a bit."}
{"text":"Green chile burro. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Large portions, I can definitely say that! Ordered two tacos, rice and beans. Huge mound of food that a fattie would pine over. Food was ok. Taco shells got soggy and were falling apart which bothered me. Shredded beef was a bit salty and chicken was a bit bland. Chips and salsa were very good though. If I went back, would try something other than the tacos. Waitress was good and got us in and out within our 1 hour lunch break. Place is not anything special but not bad, was simply ok. I think this is what you would call Mormon Mexican food. Not saying I hate MM food (Costa Vida is great) but this place tries to come off as authentic and nothing about the flavors were big like they should be in true Mexican food..."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the back of the plaza is a hidden gem.  Start with warm chips and salsa and fast service that never lets your drink get empty.  

Portions are huge and come with rice and beans.  Can also order a la carte.  

Can't wait to go back and try more selections from the menu."}
{"text":"Not bad!

The building is \"old\" mission style and quite charming inside.  The service was welcoming.   I noticed their margarita of the day displayed on the chalkboard, it's the one I want to try!  We were seated after a 10 minute wait.  The usual chips and salsa came out  just in time.  The salsa needs improvement along with the hot sauce on the side.

I had the a la carte seafood enchilada and Lucky Day Margarita (silver tequila with midori).  I would have like to see more seafood in there, for $6.75, not too bad.  The green chile sauce had more roux than hatch, but still suprisingly tasty.  They definitely don't skimp on the tequila.  

Hubby decided on the Sonoran enchilada ($11.75).  He had to douse it with the hot sauce for lack of heat.  Remember, they cater more to the \"American\" taste buds.  No \"Carolina Paradox\" here (borrowed from iain B.).  He's not too crazy about the ground beef filling, since it is their specialty, he had to try it.   Just iced tea for our DD.  Poor mijo :(

My cutie pie wanted plain old quesadilla...er..I mean cheese crisp and Sprite. The flour tortilla was deep fried then topped with cheddar cheese.  You could probably guess the outcome..indigestion.  One slice and he was done.  I will have to remember to ask them to melt the cheese on the fresh tortilla.
 
My FIL could only eat half of his carne asada burrito.  It's full of charred moist carne.  He enjoyed it with  the house margarita.

Overall, I would give this place 3.5 for the food and an extra .5 for the fun atmosphere.  Yes, we would come back here again."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Nandos and I must say the place was hopping.  We started with margaritas and chips n salsa. The margaritas were average at best and I would say the same about the chips and salsa. There really wasn't anything that made you want to order them again. I must say the service was excellent. Lots of helpers and service personnel always on the spot. 
We ordered a cheese crisp that was well prepared and came with plenty of cheese. It was devoured. For the final  course we had the El Jefe Chimichanga and Pollo RICO.  The beef in the Chimi wasn't that great but the portion size was huge. My pollo Rico was very tasty. I would the beans were of poor quality. They tasted like prepared canned refried beans and and no texture.  This is definitely a go big or go home restaurant menu."}
{"text":"I've noticed my last two visits keep going downhill. This last Thursday I dined there at about 5:00. The place was considerably busy. 
I could tell the server was fairly new, but that's ok. He did great. The food was good. 
My only complaint is the dining area is filthy. It's not like from a previous table. First thing is the setup on the table had a filthy plate and a filthy sauce bowl. There was dried food on both pieces. After getting those replaced. I know several of the ceiling tiles were very dusty. The air exchange vents haven't been wiped in a very long time. The light fixtures above the table were so covered in dust, we were watching that none fell in our food. 
This used to be one of our favorite places to eat. 
I hope the attention to detail comes back. This didn't used to be the case."}
{"text":"Normally this would be a 5 star review. My wife and I are currently trying to enjoy a nice lunch together and Nandos has the patio door open...in May it's 102 degrees outside. It's hot inside and what's even more annoying is we are being bombarded by flies while we try to eat our meal. We've complained about the flies, the people next to us complained and the only thing we got was an apology. No one shut the patio door."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Nando's, this place is really good!  There are always fresh, crisp chips to start off the meal.  Everything I have had here is yummy, my favorite being the pollo rico.  It is cheesy, creamy, and tastes homemade.

Why did I only give it 4 stars then?  We live in AZ.  There are TONS of Mexican food joints.  I only gave it 4 stars because it is on the pricier side.  I have found cheaper alternative options in the area where I feel the food is comparable.  Don't get my wrong, the food is delicious and I would definitely recommend going.  It is just shy of the 5 star mark."}
{"text":"We eat here regularly and like that it is consistent. Food is always good, and we always order flour chips, which are delicious. Service is usually good too. One time we were in a hurry and our waitress miraculously brought our order in record time. I've been here for gatherings and reserved the patio and the hideaway, never any issues. We like this location better than the north Mesa one, which is too loud."}
{"text":"Had combo steak/chicken fajitas - lunch portion.  Fantastic!  One of the best plates of fajitas I've had.  Only problem - the $10 lunch portion is HUGE!  Enough for two meals!  Ended up here as Tia what's her name is closed in Mesa now.  Great alternative!

Great service, great prices, and great food.  What more can you ask?"}
{"text":"Honestly one of the worst Mexican restaurants in the entire valley. All they do is pile more and more cheese on everything. Nice patio and beer  is cold but do not order food ever."}
{"text":"Delicious! I normally frequent Nando's for their lunch specials with coworkers. The Pollo Fundido is absolutely amazing, but you can't go wrong with anything there. The chips and salsa are on par- I'd recommend mixing the two for the best flavor. My coworker normally gets the taco salad with ground beef and it's evident they use fresh ingredients. All the portions are very large so come hungry!"}
{"text":"Even the lunch portions are ginormous! They have great chips and flavorful salsa and a wide variety of dishes on their menu. I love the Pollo Rico special with rice and beans. Service is always on par and food makes it out quick and correct the first time!"}
{"text":"I have been to Nandos before and it was good but I usually eat in. Today is Christmas Eve and I went to get chile con queso dip with the regular tortilla chips. I understand they are busy but to send me home with burnt tortillo chips is out of order. I said all of this to say check your order before you leave, even if they staple the bag shut. Just warning you all. I am very unhappy. Luckily, I have store bought tortillas in my pantry. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty average but they do have a good beer selection. They have a tap specifically for Four Peaks beers and the salsa was solid."}
{"text":"This is one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants and I've tried to like it too.  Sadly, I've had too few good experiences to want to return.  Last visit was Friday evening after a baseball game.  We arrived a little before 8pm on Friday.  I worked as a server.  Good restaurants are hoping on a Friday so don't expect to be cut from the floor before 9pm.  Apparently, the restaurant wasn't as busy so the servers cut themselves.  We were sat as soon as we walked in (good sign) server took our drink order right away( another good sign), drinks were dropped off right away (still good) and then our server disappeared.  10 minutes later after numerous times turning around to look at the host stand and to try to spot my server, still no order taken.  In the meantime, he was sat three more times.  Great, this means he will be taking all of our orders at once, submitting and serving.  So we can now expect a 20 min wait for food (by this time we are sitting 15 mins).  He finally takes the order and the other tables and we wait.  When dinner arrives it seems like they got my order correct.  They didn't.  I order a meatless tamale and received one with shredded chicken.  I had hoped to tell my server (he stopped by once after dinner was served, prior to my finding the mistake and we told him things looked good).  We didn't see him again until after he finished rolling his silverware (he walked past us with it) and by then I didn't want to waste anymore time there.   We told him it was fine and asked for the check.  Busser had removed my plate so the evidence was gone.  He was friendly enough just not attentive enough for me at 8pm on a Friday.   There are too many other choices for Mexican food to keep going  back.  

*We were seated close to computer so the servers were all chatting which is how I know some of them 'cut' themselves off the floor."}
{"text":"Seated quickly and good service.  Place was clean.  Food was mediocre.  Not bad, but much better in the area.  It looks like it would be a fantastic place for large groups."}
{"text":"I had some delicious seafood tacos. Chips and salsa were very flavorful and quickly refilled. We had a large party of 15 and the wait staff did a great job. Some of the best Mexican food I've had outside California."}
{"text":"My wife and I have enjoyed our several dining experiences here.  

The chips and salsa were absolutely delicious.  Light, thin, non greasy chips, salsa comes in a small bottle that you can mix with the offered hot salsa.  Verrrrry good!

The margaritas are really great!  Generous glasses, but ya gotta be careful, you're on to your 1st which leads to the second, and WOW!  Heh!

My wife had the Barrios Tacos which she enjoyed very much.  I tried a bite and they're very good.  I had the El Numero Seite (aka #7 Cheese Enchilada, Taco, Beef Tamale, and refried beans w/ melted cheese on top and a garnish of lettuce and tomatoes.  Outstanding freshness and taste!  Also, the portions are generous enough that most will take a to go box.

Overall, our experience with the staff has been generally positive. However, several times, they've (either the wait staff or the chefs) made mistakes (overcooking beef on two occasions or missing meal items) on our orders.  On our latest visit for dinner a couple of days ago, our sever was talking with some guests that were apparently her friends.  We had to wait several minutes to get her attention. This happened twice and was a bit annoying the second time.  No problem with wait staff being friendly to patrons, just remember, you have other guests in your area that may need attention during their meals as well.

Overall, Nando's is a very good Mexican restaurant, one that I'm sure we'll enjoy for years to come."}
{"text":"Excellent little, local based Mexican cantina. We have been a few times but have to say HAPPY HOUR is the best. The food is excellent, Happy hour pizza (traditional with super crispy crust and choice of meat and Pizza Blanco, a white cheese based pizza with super thin and crispy crust with cream cheese and more)... their staff is also excellent Sadie sat us and brought us margaritas and our food within 15m of a busy happy hour on a Friday night! Could not be happier and will go back. Love it!"}
{"text":"My recommendation is based on their party catering.  I was planning my father's 80th birthday party and since I live out of town and we were expecting 30 guests, we decided to have it delivered and set up with burners.  They also offer the serving service but I declined that.  Nando's is my father's favorite restaurant. (His favorite item is their beef burrito.)   He's 100% Mexican and knows good Mexican food.   I worked with Louis, the manager.  I appreciated that he didn't try to oversell the amount of food and respected my pocket book.  We went with a few of their party platters,  several types of enchiladas,  tamales, beans/rice, chips, salsa and taquitos.   The lady who delivered the food was on time,  explained useful tips to keep the food warm and not soggy, and was expeditious with the set up.  All the food was very good!  I recieved so many complements on the food from the guests,  who also happen to be  Mexican.  The food was very reasonably priced, high quality  and Louis was extremely professional and made it easy for me.   If I ever need catering in the future, Nando's will be place I use.  Thank you for making my dad's 80th memorable!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing. I personally love the Pollo Rico chimichanga with Machaca in it. The jalapeño cream cheese on top was insane. Couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"Attempted to give this restaurant another shot. It did not go well. I walked up to the hostess to put my name in and she doesn't even greet me or make eye contact. I have to be the person to say,\"Hi,\" like I care. Terrible start to the Cinco celebration. To the manager that I hope reads this, it was the young girl with the shoulder length hair that has not updated the highlights in her hair. I would provide her name, but she isn't even wearing a name tag, but converse shoes instead. Oh, she was working during the time of my initial visit which was 8pm."}
{"text":"Good food,  generous portions and best of all my 10 year old approved the kids menu. 
Only downside,  a little pricey but I'm willing to pay for good food and service. 
We'll be back."}
{"text":"Not sure why all the reviews about this being a 'legit' Mexican place... because it's not. Filibertos is more authentic than Nando's. 

We went there for dinner and ordered a house margarita, a cheese crisp for the little one and a mini combo platter. The margarita tasted like soap, no lie it had bubbles, the cheese crisp was good, our son ate sufficiently and the mini combo platter, yeah that sucked big time. The meat and tortillas tasted funny, it had cheese overload and the only thing good from it were the mini tacos. Their chips and salsa are good and service was pretty good. Our waitress took off the combo platter, even after we told her not to (so she deserved her tip above and beyond)."}
{"text":"Love it every time! The chips and salsa are great, margaritas are always exactly what you want."}
{"text":"Our server was great and offered us suggestions when we told him it was our first time there. The margaritas and food came quickly and were wonderful!"}
{"text":"Went there on a friday night at 9PM.  I think it closed at 10PM so not really a night place. The chips and salsa are terrible.  The expensive margaritas are so-so, still tastes like they don't use fresh limes even though they say they do. So far not so good, but the service was great.

Second time there got a carne asada burrito off lunch menu.  Tasted great and definitely filling.  

Went there the third time for breakfast, but was disappointed with the menu.  Seemed more like American food than Mexican.  Coffee was good though, and so was the service."}
{"text":"We LOVE Nando's!!! Fantastic Food, Spectacular Servers, Absolutely phenomenal food!!  Cheese enchiladas, yum, Chimichangas, YES!!  Loved the chips and salsa!! We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"This location is great always great customer service. My all time favorite dish here is \"Pollo Rico\" it is SO good. Have had others try it whom I have taken here and they also loved it."}
{"text":"I ate at this place a few times a few years ago, and this dish was/is memorable:

Chuletas Con Chile Rojo ~ Just like Nana used to make...two pork chops grilled then simmered in a spicy red chile sauce. Served with rice, whole beans, warm flour tortillas, and green chile salsa on the side. $12.50

I had that every time, and it ROX.  Always enough to take home some after getting full.  Worth the trip.

Salsa and chips were good too."}
{"text":"First time trying this place , I enjoyed there
Taco Tuesday for only $8 bucks.  So much food for a very little price.   The chips and salsa just kept on coming.   Huge portions for what I had 

I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around, huge plates. Nice environment at night too. Only bad thing is the bar closes at 930"}
{"text":"AWESOME food! The staff rocks too! We hosted a party here (that was amazing) and accidentally left a photo behind. We came back a few days later and Arturo recognized us and returned the photo. We love this place!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite places to eat Mexican food and I recommend it to many people. Growing up in Arizona, I have found many places claiming they do authentic Mexican food. Not the case for many places. Nandos definitely serves great authentic Mexican food! They get really busy at times but its worth the wait. We try to go a little bit early to avoid a big waiting time. The staff is very outgoing and the servers seem to remember you if they have waited on you before. Nice to go to a place that serves exactly what they advertise."}
{"text":"I love Nando's!

The staff is quick and attentive. The restaurant itself does a lot of work in the community by donating portions of their sales to various nonprofits in the Valley. Last time I was there is was Sunshine Acres Children Home. 

If you are going with a friend I recommend that you get the Mini Combo Platter, you get a little bit of everything and they serve their delicious Jalapeno Cream Cheese, sour cream mix with it, which is not on the menu, so if you want to order something and try it you have to ask for it. 

Their drinks are delicious, Prickly Pear Margarita is one my favorites. There is indoor and outdoor seating and its never noisy."}
{"text":"Nando's was our 2nd choice one night the week after Christmas, but the first choice place was completely busy and backed up. SO glad they were, as we had outstanding food and wonderful customer service at Nando's!  My picky husband rates Mexican restaurants on tacos, chips and salsa, and rarely gives a good rating, so this 5-star rating comes from both of us. He can't wait to go back! Other items ordered in our party were a beef chimi, which was quite flavorful, and barrio tacos, which were so delicious!  It's been a month, so we're overdue for our return to Nando's."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch during the week day with my coworkers. Surprisingly we were sat immediately, they have a big venue so can fit a large capacity. Service was good and friendly. The complimentary chips and salsa were fantastic. Chips had a perfect thickness to it giving it a good crunch. The salsa is mild but they also give you a stronger side of salsa for a stronger burn (personally I love having more options for salsa). 

For the main course I ordered the Steak Picado Specialty plate. A little too cheesy for my liking but easily removable (I know most people wouldn't even care). The steak pieces were cooked perfectly to what I would call a medium - not dry at all and still have good taste consistency and taste. I would just like for it to have extra salsa or hot sauce for the plate itself. Beans and rice were good, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Since we live in the neighborhood we frequent nearly all of the establishments around us with the exception of any national chains and thankfully there are very few of those. We've been to Nando's main establishment in the front of the building. Consistently good food and great service as the place is usually packed most evenings. 

But the Hideaway, that's a much different story. Looking for breakfast we dropped in this morning. The place was about 2/3 full as we stood there since there were not host/hostess around. Some guy who was sitting with a party said, just sit wherever. Ok we did. We waited and waited then finally the waiter came by and gave us menus and walked away. We waited another 5-8 minutes then he came back and asked what we wanted for beverage and we ordered our coffees and water. Those came without hesitation. Ok then time to order. While we were waiting to order another older couple came in and sat down. By that time the guy who had directed us to sit anywhere had moved on to talk with others at another table. It was obvious that he was the manager. 

Our waiter finally returned and took out order. As we waited, we noticed that that older couple that came in had been totally ignored by the wait staff. The gentleman looked around and mentioned something to a passing waitress but to no avail. They got up and left and at that point anyone would have done the same. The most disturbing part was this \"manager\" was sitting right next to them and totally ignored them as they left. That was wrong. He should had seen before they even thinking of leaving that something was wrong. Instead he chose to ignore the situation and the customers as well. Well enough on that. 

Our food arrived 20 minutes after we had ordered and that did not disappoint. I had the mexican pizza and my wife the nuevos ranchero plates. Delicious! But, during that whole time not one server came by to ask about refills on coffee when they had been emptied long long before. When we were through we had to flag down a server for to go boxes and the check. Our original server hung around and talked to folks at the bar the whole time. We paid with cash so we could get out of there before lunch. I gave it 2 stars ONLY because the food was 4 star+. The service however a 1 at best. The manager a negative 5 stars for his ignorance. Gotta fix this or we won;t be back."}
{"text":"I love this place great fajitas the margaritas are great. my kids share the sampler platter and they are stuffed"}
{"text":"One of my go to places in the area. The food is always great and he service is quick. I would highly recommend Nando's to someone looking for a place to grab some typical Mexican food. I have had the chimichanga and tacos. Also check out their lunch menu for great deals!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our visit. We had a group of 8, which I understand isn't easy. We had to ask several times for drink refills, my stepmother was served a margarita that was undrinkable. We had to ask for extra mixer, but wasn't brought a larger glass to mix it, again 5 minutes to wait for that. In my opinion, when that was asked they should've offered to make her a new drink, but we thought we'd try to fix the situation. Even after adding the mixer, it was horrible, maybe bad tequila?? Then the food came, carne asada tacos had crunchy meat, food was overall very bland & when we asked for sides i.e.: sour cream, we had to ask several times & it was brought out at the end of the meal (pointless at that point). I'm not one to look for free items, but the margarita should've been taken off the bill. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Good for your soul (if not your waistline) food!  Delicious, fresh food, service with a hustle (we sat at the bar during lunchtime), enormous portions and pretty much everything is smothered in cheese!  Whatever you get, make sure you try the succulent (yes, succulent) beef machaca as one of your fillings.  Unbelievable.  Spinach enchilada is super rich and tasty and the sonoran enchilada was so flavorful!  My best tip is to wear pants with an elastic waistband or just go all out and wear a muu-muu or caftan!"}
{"text":"Nandos completely went above and beyond our expectations when it came to catering our wedding. Christy was an absolute dream to work with - ensuring that the whole process was stress-free. We were able to provide a delicious buffet style meal to our guests without breaking the bank. They are still raving about the food! Thanks Nandos"}
{"text":"Nandos, Macayos, Mi Amigos, Arriba, Carlos O'Briens, Julios, Mata's etc...It's all just a sea of cheese and mediocrity if you ask me.  A sea of cheese and mediocrity."}
{"text":"It's Margarita Time! 

Their margaritas are legit (can I still use that word?). I usually have their Carne Asada Burritos they're pretty big. I usually fill up on their chips and salsa and take my half burrito home for late night snack. It's a good place for groups or happy hour."}
{"text":"I'm actually a big fan of this place. Obviously  since I've eaten  here so many times . I've had the simplest of things so often . Cheese enchilada and beef taco. They have always been so good. I have to actually keep myself from eating just the chips and salsa . The salsa is addicting !"}
{"text":"Had previously enjoyed the food quality and atmosphere, atmosphere is still the same, food has diminished considerably, had fish tacos the last time and the fish pieces were notable and tasty, this times visit my companion had the El Jefe Chimichanga ~ A crisp burro filled with your choice of grilled chicken, sautéed onions and tomatoes. Topped with guacamole, sour cream, cheese and green onions. Served with rice and beans. $14.50.
The Chimi was dry, a glob of tasteless guac on top, dollop of sour cream and dry chicken inside.
My fare was Alfredo's Green Chile Pork ~ A plate of tender pork simmered in a spicy Hatch green chile sauce. Topped with Monterey Jack cheese and served with rice, beans and flour tortillas. $11.50.
The plate was 90% beans and rice, the tender pork consisted of maybe 6 to 8 pieces the size of Lima beans, covered with pico to mask the portion size.  I tasted one of the pieces of pork and it was tolerable, but while searching for it's companions, i decide to return it to the kitchen and chose to forgo a replacement, ate my chewy and bland tortillas that tasted as tho they had been microwaved before being placed in the foil.
The Manager came to the table to apologize and advised that he had admonished the kitchen on the amount of protein; and suggested that it may have be the \"end of the portions\", not exactly what i wanted to hear as an apology. We will be looking for other options for our Mexican Fare, to bad."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is awesome! The service however, it depends on what crew is working. I have my favorites ;) I wish they were open later though!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty tasty, but expensive compared with similar food in Mesa area.  The margaritas are way too expensive.  They have a happy hour BUT only in the bar.  I just don't understand why restaurants don't extend happy hours to ANY of their eating establishment locations.  They ARE trying to attract business aren't they?  I've NEVER seen a 'special' price on anything at Nandos. Even though food is good, I'll probably go elsewhere due to excessive cost."}
{"text":"We have been customers since the very beginning, but sadly will no longer be coming back. The over all taste of the food has become very bland.  We ordered last night the veggie fajitas and they should have been called the ONION fajitas. 90% onion. What happen to the potatoes and other veggies???!  $13 for that?!?  Then there is the unfriendly bar staff. Not that they have ever been good, but it's gotten worse. No personality and you have to ask constantly for drinks, food and basic needs. Done over paying for a horrible evening of bland food and service."}
{"text":"I've been coming to nandos for a few yrs now, I can say I've never eaten a bad meal from here! The service however is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. The last couple times I've come in a few of the staff has been a little rude."}
{"text":"The wifey and I were wanting some good Mexican and came across this gem. I ordered the Fajitas Burro and she ordered the Pollo Rico. Mine was a dandy with creamy guacamole and simmering steak. My wife's on the other hand wasn't as crisp as we probably wanted it to be. It was a little soggy but the chicken inside was AMAZING. We'll probably be back very soon. Prices were decent."}
{"text":"We just moved out to Gilbert and have been trying to find some great places to eat but haven't had much luck. Until one day we stumbled upon Nando's. Let me tell you, this place is AWESOME!!!!! My husband says is going to try everything on the menu. Everything that we have had has been perfect. My three and four year olds love it too. Every time we pass Nando's they ask to eat there. Oh and the margaritas are soooooooooo GOOD!"}
{"text":"My family and I made our first visit to Nando's and it was excellent!  The staff was friendly and quick to serve us whatever we requested.  The food was very fresh, served hot and quick, filling and priced right.  The chips & salsa was excellent as were the margaritas!  We certainly will be back!"}
{"text":"A lot of my restaurant reviews are 4 stars - I wish they had 4.5 and 3.5.  This is a great place, a little hidden behind the car wash, but it is where locals come to eat with their families a lot.  huge portion sizes and traditional sit down Mexican food.  Nothing about this place seems \"WOW!\" but you find yourself going back there again and again.  That is an endorsement all it's own I suppose."}
{"text":"We used to like this place but not a good experience this time.  Our server was great but the food tasted old and just slopped on the plate."}
{"text":"So what the food isn't that good and the service isn't the best... Their three dollar mimosas and bloody Mary's come in big glasses and will help you not care. My huevos rancheros looked bland and disgusting but drunk me still ate it... I would have taken more than three bites too, had the yolk in my over medium eggs not been rock hard. I didn't complain I was happy. 

Hmmmm.. Maybe next time I'll eat breakfast at home and go their for drinks :)"}
{"text":"This place is great! The cheese crisp is to die for, they do not jip you on the cheese. Israel is a great server with an awesome energy. Definitely recommended to come check or Nando's for delicious and affordable food! Gracias"}
{"text":"I was hoping this would be good but it's not. I went with two others about a week ago for lunch. We sat out on the patio which was very nice. They brought chips and salsa. Those were okay, although the chips seemed unnaturally yellow, like they were dyed. I ordered a taco combo, one shredded beef, one chicken. The chicken one was ok, but the beef tasted off to me. My son had the same reaction to his shredded beef chimi. It tasted like it had been around for a while :(. My husband ordered the spinach enchilada combo and thought the whole plate was just too mushy and gooey. Not a good experience and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Not a favorite at all!  Nothing is homemade like in East Los Angeles.  Processed Mexican food is NOT real Mexican food.  Re-fried beans NEED lard, not canned beans.  Eggs were burned around the edges.  Canned hot sauces taste....canned.
Not going back."}
{"text":"Normally, I visit the Nando's location in NE Mesa, but having just moved closer to this location, I thought I'd get acquainted.  I ordered the Quesadilla with chicken; my daughter ordered the Nachos with beef.  Both dishes were very large portions!  Food was fresh and delicious! Waiter was attentive and quick to refill drinks.  Although the parking lot was nearly full, we were seated immediately.  The last time I visited this location, I was not impressed with it.  However, this time I was.  It was a Monday night, and the place was nearly full.  Thanks, Nandos! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I saw the high ratings and decided to give this place a try.  I ordered the Taco Tuesday special, 3 tacos, rice, beans, and cheese.  It came out on a big plate.  The portions looked huge and generous.  Upon closer inspection, it was the rice and beans that were generous.  The tacos themselves were pretty small and tasted like tacos you'd normally get at a decent taco stand for half the price.  The rice was nice and fluffy.  It tasted fresh.  I'm from Houston, Texas, and used to the excellent Mexican food there.  This place misses the mark in comparison.

Shortly after eating here, I did not feel very good.  After 4 hours I felt pretty bad and had to go to bed early.  I tossed and turned a lot.  The next morning went to the bathroom and had diarrhea.  Okay, so I am not coming back.  A little bit overpriced and food poisoning is not healthy."}
{"text":"Bad, bad, bad.  Moved to the Valley from Tucson and based on many yelper's comments decided to try Nando's to get our Mexican food fix.  There was a line out the door and the place was packed.  We had high hopes.  Guacamole tasted like something purchased in a refrigerated section of the grocery store.  Salsa tasted like tomato sauce.  Neither my husband nor I could finish the food.  Bland, not the least bit authentic and downright gross.  Took the leftovers home to my teenage kids (they usually eat everything).  They took one bite and discarded the rest...citing that Taco Bell was more authentic.  My only assumption can be that those that have yelped have never experienced authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Service is good. Food is fresh. But the parking situation is a nightmare. It takes between 5-45 minutes to find parking even if the wait is 10 min."}
{"text":"I've been here before for their enchiladas which are decent, but I've only started liking Mexican food as of a few months ago. Tonight, I ordered for my dinner a Mexican pizza with no tomatoes because I'm allergic. First bite was dry and disgusting, the second bite was still dry but loaded with tomatoes. I told the waiter, daniel, who offered to take the pizza away.

I then ordered a mushroom enchilada (my first time ordering this dish) and it came out and was also revolting. The mushrooms were clearly as old as can be, they used waaaaaayyy too much cilantro, and it was also revolting. I told Daniel when he came back to check again - I told him I'd pay for it, I don't care, but I was starving (from waiting for an hour for my table and my meal.)I tried to order my fried and true cheese enchilada plate, but Daniel kept insisting they're not going to take any more off of my bill for the nasty mushroom enchiladas because they already took 50% off of my tomato pizza.

I again told Daniel I didn't care if I had to pay for it, I didn't care, but he kept pushing back - implying he was against putting in yet another order for me. Pretty much saying that I was a problem customer. It was HUMILIATING in front of my table of friends. He literally put me into tears he was so mean and judgmental about it. And I was being SOOO NICE! 

I rejected putting in another order, insisted on my check, paid for my nasty food, and left starving and crying. I hate this place."}
{"text":"I was hoping for a local joint to add to my list but no such luck.  I was out with a couple of friends, one (from a large Mexican family) recommended the place since we were in the area.  Going with that and the fact that it seemed pretty busy I said what the heck.  We could've done better...

Once our waitress finally arrived she was friendly enough, but seemed a little overwhelmed.  The chips & salsa that followed were completely underwhelmed.  Bland factory chips and the um, salsa you say?   Really?  We added 2 of the little cups of \"spicy\" sauce to it just to give it some taste.  Didn't give me the warm/fuzzies.

With plenty of interesting menu options, I went with the tacos pescado.  One word:  dull.  Almost overloaded with dry, bland chunks of mahi-mahi, and a huge pile of rice and beans each with little flavor.  I didn't taste chipotle in the chipotle cream sauce.  I splashed them with the \"spicier\" sauce, black pepper and still nothing.  My other 1st timer friend later told me he felt the same about his entree, like he'd just eaten a big pile of beans with a chimi on the side.

I can see why the place is busy, plenty of grub for the American belly for the price.  I'm sure relatives from Minnesota would say oh its gosh darn good yabetchya!  But it's the kinda Mexican food I don't want, it goes ka-thunk on the plate, throw on the cheddar & ta-da.  No thanks, I need to taste something!   A little spice?  A little fire?  Nothing?  No?  Oh....

I decided to introduce my Mexican friend to flavors and took him to Los Sombreros.   Mmmmm...mmmm!"}
{"text":"Good solid Mexican food.  I ate the El Jefe Carne Asada Chimichanga which was alright, but it had stewed tomatoes in it which I didn't care for.  Happy hour is 3-6 with $3.50 Margaritas and food specials.  If I was in the area, I would go again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is warm and inviting but the food here is lackluster. Bland salsa and tasteless chips to start.  We had the special: tilapia fish tacos. Mushy fish and greasy corn tortillas. The rice and beans were the best part of our meal. This is our third time to try this place. Not going back."}
{"text":"My first review was a little harsh.  I just ate here again and am revising my review....This place does a lot of things well.  Clean, with a cool atmosphere and a very friendly staff.  Large restaurant but seating is layed out well so that it feels pretty private.  Can accomodate large groups.  Food is fresh and well prepared.  My issue with Nando's is the lack of a wow factor with any of their dishes.  If you want good food that is well prepared and a large menu you will be very satisfied.  

For me, when I go to a sit down restaraunt I want a dish on the menu that is memorable, unique, and tastey.  Food is solid, but for me not even in my top 10 mexican restaurants in metro Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer at Nando's since we moved to the neighborhood 5 years ago, and have never had a bad meal.  Service is always great--to be fair, one waitress there comes off a little gruff at times.  But they have great Happy Hour specials, delicious house margaritas, generous portions, and tasty food.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Chicken chimichanga very good nice and moist chicken. Chicken fajitas very good and full after eating"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting!  We went here twice on a work lunch. Last year everything was fine, the food was good. It was the first good Mexican food I had in a while.  This experience, however... NOT GOOD! I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE. 
First off, there was dried food in my water glass.  My co-worker who sat next to me had something stuck to his fork, so he exchanged it out for different silverware and the new set had cheese still attached to the knife. I was repulsed.
We got our food and I ordered chimichangas.  They were gross!  The ground beef on the inside was tasteless, not even salt or pepper... nothing.  When I cut it open water, grease, or some liquid poured out.  I can't believe that someone would serve that quality of food and charge the prices they were charging.
I will not eat here again even if it is a work lunch and is paid for.  I would rather fill up on chips and salsa and not even order a main entree."}
{"text":"We love the food and the service at this place but one problem we have seen every time we eat here. They never clean up the food on the floors and off the seats after someone makes a big mess. We were escorted to a seat last night that I had to brush off the food from before I could sit down. Other then that, its a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Feels a little too much like a franchise, but I guess that's because they have multiple locations.  When it comes to Mexican food though, I like to feel like I'm eating at some hole-in-the-wall place.  From the inside this place didn't even feel like a Mexican restaurant.  They could be serving burgers or steaks; the décor really doesn't give you any hints towards the cuisine.  The food was good though.  I ordered the combo plate which was a very good size and offered a good variety.  It comes with a spatula to try and pursued you to share kind of like family style.  However, lol, don't be ashamed to toss the spatula aside and claim the whole plate for yourself.  It is a lot of food, but I think one person can handle it.  I only wished the shells and tortillas on the plate were a little crispier.  The plate has a lot of sauce and cheese and I'm not sure if my plate had to sit while waiting for the other entries to come out.  Either way, it was still pretty good, and I would go again.  Not the most authentic Mexican food, but if you're in a bind in will do the job."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong here.  It's more elegant than a typical Mexican restaurant.  I found the food perfectly edible and hits the spot when I have a craving for Mexican but I save 4 and 5 star reviews for Mexican restaurants when they are truly a cut above.  Usually the best Mexican food is found on plastic plates in divey locations.

Go here for perfectly good Mexican food but you won't be blown away.  Also I didn't like their margaritas."}
{"text":"Came in on a friday after work, 10 minute wait not bad. Got seated and ordered my food. I ordered the enchiladas and asked for it to have little cheese on top because they ALWAYS pack it with way too much. When my food arrived it was still overly loaded. Not happy with the service. Seemed that the waiters need to slow down and write the orders down and the cooks need to slow down because theyre slopping."}
{"text":"I ordered the spinach rice and beans which was excellent. Service was slow to start I waited 10 minutes for a cup of tea. Lunch is a very busy time but it'd still return because the food is very good"}
{"text":"Typical Mormon / Mexican restaurant. I don't know when they will comprehend that proselytizing in a country for 2 years does not give you a mastery of their native cuisine and increasing the single portions to family size doesn't make up for lack of spice or skill. There I said it."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible!!! I took my Dad and his wife that were visiting from out of town and I felt so bad that the food was so tasteless. The waiter was super rude and slow. Then my Dad went to pay for the bill and he didn't realize until later that he had given them an expired credit card so the manager came over and was almost yelling at us saying the card was declined in her loudest voice saying she tried 3 times. Then my Dad paid with another card and we left to be chased down by the rude ass waiter saying my Dad didn't sign the bill when in actuality he did but the manager had taken the bill before the waiter seen it. We were all horrifies and humiliated the way we were ALL treated! So very disappointed. Never in all my life was I treated like a thief. I will never be back to this place again."}
{"text":"Came by one day after work to check it out. They did a lot of work on the decor - doors and tables and chairs are very ornate. To sum up my experience of this place - they seem to favor quantity over quality. Huge bowl of chips and salsa - which was just unnecessary for two people. Huge plate portions and everything seemed to come out a little \"too fast\" - as in everything pre-made and re-warmed before serving and then topped with copious amounts of sauce and cheese to compensate. I noticed that the neighboring tables turned very quickly. Almost like at a fast food joint. People didn't seem to be there for spending quality time with each other - just eat and go. 

I must say - the food didn't taste bad. It just seemed very over-crowded and impersonal and not very noteworthy. 

I haven't been back since because it just wasn't a great experience and there are other restaurants in the same shopping plaza that do a better job overall."}
{"text":"Good food. Try the Pollo Rico"}
{"text":"This place is nothing special.  It's a shame too because really all you have to do is use fresh ingredients.  They give you lots of food with no flavor seek other places."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a casual lunch last weekend with my mom and my son.  Immediately upon being seated, I noticed that the salsa dish was dirty.  Then my mom noticed her water glass was dirty and her fork.  My fork was also dirty.  And I'm no clean freak either, there were visible food remnants on these items.  If my son hadn't been so hungry we likely would've left.

The waiter was very apologetic and nice, so the 2nd star is for him.  The food was not terrible, just unmemorable.  The best part of the experience was the warm chips, decent salsa, and my cold Corona."}
{"text":"Nice little Mexican restaurant! The food was very great! Loved how fresh it tasted. The portion of food they give is amazing! Chips and salsa was so good too! I had the flataus I think that's how you spell it, but it is so good!!! Definitely coming back! Service was amazing!"}
{"text":"So I pass this place all the time. I was happy to see a new place take over the space. Well, on a whim, I decided to go here with a couple friends to try something new. Beautiful restaurant interior and atmosphere. Big and you don't feel crowded or that people are eavesdropping into your conversation. I had a WONDERFUL server that far exceeded our expectations. Chips and salsa, plain amazing! The food portions were HUGE, and for a great price in my opinion. I got a combo and I had so much, I had lunch for the next day at work. I got to try my friends dishes and they were nothing short of delicious. That is passionate food right there. I cannot wait to go back. In these times, I don't usually do 5 stars, but we just had such a blast and was so surpised at the quality of the food and presentation, they deserve it."}
{"text":"Like others have mentioned, this place is tucked away in a strip mall on the SW corner of Val Vista and Baseline behind Arby's and soon to be behind a brand new IHOP.  I've driven past this place 100's of times and never even noticed it!  

Stopped in on a late Sunday afternoon and there was steady traffic in and out and for carry-out as well; always a good sign to me.  We were seated in a comfortable booth right away and it wasn't long before they brought us out chips and salsas.  The chips were warm and the salsas were mild!  Even the little cup of \"hot\" salsa had barely any heat at all.  Even the wimpiest of spice haters wouldn't even know it was \"hot\".  I mentioned this to our waiter who was quick to offer the \"REALLY HOT Habanero salsa\".  It was hot, as hot as I expected the other stuff to be, and certainly not as hot as other habanero sauces I've had.  It did have a nice taste and I'd for sure ask for it next time.

I had the seafood rellenos and they were okay.  Covered in sauce and cheese, and more sauce and cheese I had to dig through to find the actual relleno.  Seafood here really means shrimp, and there were a good amount of small shrimp under the cheese and sauce.  The actual pepper had a nice taste, and the pico de gallo served on the plate was cool and spicy.  Serve the relleno/shrimp with 1/2 the sauce and cheese and twice the amount of pico de gallo and I would have been much happier.  The beans and rice were good and served to sop up most of the sauce when I ate it the next day for lunch.  Portions are huge!  The margarita was tasty and guacamole was okay.

I'd probably stop in again for a margarita and try something different from the menu.  Had a comforable atmosphere and a nice sectioned off outside eating area as well.  Overall, everything was just okay, nothing special, not bad, just not particularly memorable."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  I eat here about a dozen times a year and it never disappoints.  I have been with as little as 6 people to as many as 30 out on the patio.  Be sure to ask for a basket of the flour chips!  You can have one basket free, but it's something they don't tell you about - you just have to be in the know.  Both the inside and outside seating is size friendly, bonus!"}
{"text":"Not sure why Nandos only has three stars? I get the Alfredo's green Chile dish every time. It's huge and tasty. I can never finish it. Also all you can eat chips and salsa. Awesome! 
Gina has been our waitress a few times. What a fun on-the-ball server she is!  You should ask for her. You'll be very happy. We always have to over tip her. Her service is that good! (And she is also a sweetheart. )"}
{"text":"The Food is GREAT! We at Boeing Like Nando's. Best service Ever!"}
{"text":"Love the food here! One of our favorite spots for Mexican food! They have huge portions too!"}
{"text":"It has been our pleasure to eat and enjoy Nandos restaurant for several years. We have always had a great meal here. We even had our rehearsal dinner for the kids wedding here. 

When we came in on Father's Day something has changed. The service was horrible and my husband's meal was never even entered into the system. They have us a gift card to come back. This was a great Gesture and we appreciated it.

Tonight, our server managed to get my gluten free order wrong and brought me food contaminated with gluten. When I mentioned this our server acres like she didn't know what I was taking about. The second plate of food just had the tacos scraped off and replaced and they served me the same beans and veggies even though they could have been cross contaminated. The chicken was cold and the corn tortillas were soggy. 

This will be our last trip here. No apology from management and the server seemed to be at a total loss and then charged my husband for his meal while I ate nothing. Poor customer service"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. Everything is amazing. Service is top notch. The food is high quality and quick! I've been here 5 times now at different times of day and love the quick food turnaround and consistent food quality."}
{"text":"I like chicken enchiladas. That said Nandos chicken enchiladas were packed with dry chicken. Fresh but unfavorable. Not something I will order if I go again. My wife and son were not really impressed with dinners either.The portions were large and we made the leftovers edible the next day."}
{"text":"Foods Fantastic! Love the Queso Sauce! Great Service even when they're busy! A Must Try!"}
{"text":"Nando's food is great Mexican food and serving size is huge.  I share the combo meal with friends. Find it it behind the Arby's south side of baseline and west side of Val Vista"}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE!  We ate here last weekend and the food was delicious and service was amazing!  And I feel horrible because I can't quite remember our servers name, I think it was Chris, last name started with a G.  He was great!  We gave our compliments to the manager and she was just as nice.  I highly recommend this restaurant and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It is a VERY rare occurrence that I wander much further east than 32nd St, let alone the literal east valley. However, I was on a mini shopping spree that somehow caused me to travel well outside of my bubble. Luckily I remembered this place from years ago, when I had lunch with a girlfriend. I was conveniently down the street from here anyways so we decided to have dinner. For a Saturday night, they were well packed, but the bar was empty. The kind bartender (never did catch his name) let me and my 6 year old sit up there to watch the basketball game. The amount of chips and salsa brought was much larger than I remembered, and expected. You also get both mild and hot salsa...choices are always nice! My son ordered the chicken taco kids meal with rice and beans, and I got the pollo rico burrito with rice and beans. HOLY CRAP, the portions are huge. I was able to cut the meal in half, and had the rest of it for dinner the next night. For the kids meal, my plate, and a margarita, after tax and tip it came to $30 bucks. Average prices, but for the amount of food you get I do think its a good deal. Staff was friendly and prompt. Only complaint would be that they are only located east valley. NANDO'S PLEASE COME TO PHOENIX!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! I have been to the other 2 locations in the valley but I love the Ambiance of this location, beautiful interior with a lot of beautiful tile work. 
The food is excellent, from the chips to the salsa, we had the Baja Shrimp Salad. It was huge with 10 seasoned and grilled shrimp with avocado, onions, cheese, tomato, creamy Jalapeño dressing, the creamy Con Queso dip with chips, loaded with flavor, and the fried ice cream with honey and chocolate  sauce. That was huge too. The staff is friendly, the owner very nice and the food orders come out fast.
I am a regular,only Mexican restaurant I like."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for Tex mex or New Mexico style cooking this is your spot. Great patio and friendly staff with all the norms you would expect on the menu. One word of caution, the food is extremely heavy so maybe fast for a week prior."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie this establishment has good food. However, some of their staff AND manager Kristy are completely unprofessional! I have been in the F&B industry since I was 13yrs old and have been a bar manager. I'm very easy to please and completely understanding. Yet, I have never in all my years experienced such disrespect. I called the establishment to order a togo, my boyfriend & I were traveling and starving but needed to be quick. When placing the Order I expressed that we would probably go to the bar and have a drink really quick but we were on a tight schedule. The manager on the phones exact words were \" NO.. We do not do that. You have to either dine in or get it togo.\"... We almost just wanted to say F** it we don't want to go there then. But we did anyways.. Upon arrival, we were directed to the bar to get our togo, the food was not ready. So we sat there being ignored with no service for few minutes. When we finally got the bars attention we were told our food still had few minutes so we got a drink and some chips. Once our food came out we opened our food to take few bites before getting back on the road, and the bartender came over and said that we weren't not allowed to do that and that it was against health code! Which is SO not true! What made it more unbelievable is the the gentlemen right next to us at the bar also had Togo food and was drinking and eating as well. This place is popular and does get busy but it's sad that because they know that, they feel that they can careless about costumer service. The WHOLE situation could have been presented another way and we would have been completely understanding, but the way they spoke to us was so unprofessional that we will never go back."}
{"text":"Really sad experience, I really like this place but lately the service have been horrible. Today The hostess told me I had to wait for 30 minutes. When I asked if I could seat at the booth by the bar. The answer I got was \" that is for bigger groups\" when I ask where we're the big group. I got \" the couple over there is also waiting\". 
As I looked around the restaurant there was at least 5 tables available. I worked on a restaurant before I know when certain sections are closed. That was not the case. 
Sad part is that It wasn't the first"}
{"text":"Heard the great news that Nandos serves breakfast , so I had to try it out 
Went in on a Saturday and ordered one of the breakfast burritos with the potato and it was excellent. I recommend giving there breakfast a try. I was not disappointed 
And the bloody marry was great and at a great price"}
{"text":"My family has eaten here many times. The food is consistently good and the staff is friendly. If you are planning to go on a Friday or Saturday evening however, the parking can be a challenge and the wait can be long."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at nando's til tonight. I have recommended time and time again this restaurant to people who have never heard of it. I will no longer go there after tonight. First, we were sat in the corner where it was so dark i could barely read the menu. I felt like we were being punished right from the start. I ordered the el jefe enchilada style with EXTRA CHEESE. i specifically said to make sure the cheese was melted cause sometimes they put so much cheese, the cheese isnt melted. Well,it came out with barely any cheese on it, barely any enchilada sauce and no rice ( i asked for double rice, no beans) my friend had more cheese on her beans than i had on my whole plate. they server took it back and added cheese, only to come back with a tiny bit more cheese on it. When the manager came over, i explained everything to her and she said oh, it looks like it had extra cheese, like i was lying! my friend had put some of her cheese on my plate thats why!!!! She's like i will take off the extra cheese off the bill. At that point i really felt like just saying i didnt want it at all but i was hungry!!! Sorry nando's but the poor customer service and poor food leads to you losing me as a customer. And if this keeps happening, you will lose one customer at a time!!! Me and my recommendations will go somewhere else...."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when I walked into Nando's was the fresh aroma of ripe tomatoes and the sweet-sharp smell of cilantro. It really got the old appetite going!

Nando's has great Mexican food, with a more modern vibe than most similar Valley restaurants. The building is in the upscale Val Vista Lakes area, and although it isn't anything fancy, the dining room is nice and clean, and features some lovely iron work (done by one of the owner's father, BTW). 

Nandos also has a large slate-tiled patio, with built-in misters and heaters (depending on the weather).

They have huge portions, and there are lots of menu choices. Great chips and salsa -- a must for any great Mexican joint -- plus queso dip. I wish the salsa was hotter, but that's my own eccentricity I suppose."}
{"text":"We really like Nando's.  It's a nice place on the inside and the food is overall pretty great.  I don't like their tortilla chips, but the Mesquite Tacos and Picado Dinner are both very good.  We always get good service and they make our orders accurately despite nitpicky requests because we eat low carb."}
{"text":"Went to nan dos Sunday was not very busy and main course was good.  Chips could have used a little salt.  The hostess was little tired and sitting in the customer table area talking to a person cleaning the floors?  Not very appealing atmosphere while eating with my family.  But will return."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times and I just don't see what the fuss is! The food is overpriced and the beans definitely tasted like there canned! It's Mexican food how hard is to make homemade refried beans? Yuck! This place is a total disappointment!"}
{"text":"I really prefer the other Nando's in Gilbert. The service at this location is terrible, but what do you expect from high school students? This staff needs some help with time management and what to do when the restaurant isn't busy but you still have tables to serve. As with the other Nando's, decent chips and salsa, lots of vegetarian choices (potato jack flauta  and black beans are really good), and a tasty margaritas. They do like to smother some of their items in cheese so be ready."}
{"text":"My parents originally brought me to Nando's and I started to like it more and more with each visit. I turned vegetarian about 14 months ago and was pleased that I could still eat here with my parents when I came to visit them. Chips are thinly crisp and the salsa tastes very fresh. They guacamole taco, as simple as it is, is very very tasty. Their black beans are also delicious. I've also had the vegetable tacos with grilled veggies, the potato jack taco, which is like mashed potatoes with spicy jack cheese, and the enchiladas. All great vegetarian options. Prices are good and servings are large. The coconut margarita is also worth mentioning."}
{"text":"I had the enchiladas and a Margarita and both were fantastic! The service was a little bit bologna considering we were sitting at the bar. I wasn't exactly sure who was providing us with service and we likely would have ordered far more drinks if there was anyone at the bar to order from.

After ordering our food, we were almost convinced they had forgotten that we had even ordered. Which we figured is why our server/bartender was mia most of our visit. We also had to ask for our tab more than twice, as well as our to go box which we finally received from the bar back who we had seen more than the server himself. 

I don't think we are needy patrons by any means but the service was insignificant and nearly nonexistent."}
{"text":"Great place. The food was so good and the atmosphere is so good for hanging out and having a drink. I am so stuffed and happy. Angela was our server and she was so nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Basic Tex-mex. nothing special, but it'll scratch the itch if you need Mexican. Prices were a bit high and they gave us flour tortillas instead of the request corn one. Waitress was a bit curt."}
{"text":"Service here is good. Friendly staff. Food is good. I ordered a pork tamale, cheese enchilada and rice and beans. The tamale was a good size and had Verde sauce on it (my favorite), the enchilada was covered in cheese and red sauce. Flavors were pretty good. Pork was cooked perfectly in the tamale. The rice and beans are good, nothing phenomenal, but still delicious carbs. The margaritas are delicious. I had a melon Margarita, which I believed to be honeydew (I assumed it would most likely be cantaloupe). It was green, tart, not too sweet and good strength. I tried a mango Margarita as well. It was more sweet than the melon one, delicious mango flavor to this. Fresh and yummy! They have a kids menu that is pretty good. My five year old like the grilled cheese and fries and my older daughter liked the bean burrito. We had fun and ate ourselves silly. Good time!"}
{"text":"OMG! This restaurant is a hidden gem! How have I lived in AZ for 7 years and just visited for the first time yesterday?! The food is delicious. Service is excellent and the prices are right. Only problem is I will probably gain weight eating here so often!"}
{"text":"Ate here while on vacation. Perhaps nothing special, but good food. It's what you'd want and expect. \"Vince\" (our server) did a great job and was very attentive. Perhaps a little too noisy for my preference."}
{"text":"Friends wanted to go out to dinner, and one of them picked the place, he has wanted to try mexican food places in the valley and Nandos was the place picked to try.

Now I have been to their other location so I was kind of excited to see this new place, I like the set up, We sat at the tables behind the bar, but it didn't feel like we were in the bar area, there was a huge tree/branch like divider separating the two area, and I thought the tree was cool. We arrived around 6:30isna and there was no wait, we were seated right away.

We ate our chips & the hot sauce disappeared, so I asked our server if we could get some more of the hot, and she asked if we like spicy things, and I said heck yea, and she then brought us out this habanero hot sauce, omg that stuff was amazing, it was spicy, smoky, and flavorful, now that I know they have that I will be requesting it all the time!

I ordered the Pollo Rico, it was cooked perfectly and tasted delish! And topped with that habanero hot sauce ooohhhh weeeee baby that was good!

I did go with the intentions of ordering some deep fried ice cream, it seems to be my latest craving that I can't get enough of, and well my dinner filled me up and I wasn't hungry anymore, so I never got it, but that just means I have to order it the next time I am there and believe me I will be back! Service was great and food was delish!"}
{"text":"Friends have been telling me about Nando's for a while and my mom is in town so we decided to head on over their Friday night for dinner there was about a 40 min wait, but we were set on staying and trying it out!

We got called to our table, and it was a table within the bar area, my mom did not like that, I asked her if she wanted me to ask them for a different table but she said no. And I thought to myself, then why did you even tell me LOL but the table was kind small and it was my mom, my oldest daughter and I, not really room for our drinks , chips,  and plates and maybe that was what she was talking about.

I got kinda excited when I saw that they had hot and mild sauce, I was thinking oh this might be it, I just might have found something to bring tears to my eyes I was ready for the heat!!!! But sadly it was not, though it was spicy to my mom, I found the hot to be a good flavor just lacking the heat I am seeking. The mild was a great flavored sauce too!

We placed our order and man the kitchen was moving fast, I swear we got our food in like 10 mins, I even think we waited longer for the table then it took to get to a seat, order and eat, crazy.

I ordered the Pollo Rico, crisp chicken burro topped with jalapeno cream cheese & cheddar cheese. When the plate arrived, I noticed that my burrito was cut in half, I don't really like that, let me explain, in my twisted mind I think why is my burro cut in half? Are these 2 halves of someone's left overs?  It's the main reason why I won't ever order a burrito from Garica's. I want my burrito whole (pout pout) and I looked around and saw other people's plates and their burros were not cut, what gives, but I got over my own issue. The burrito was lacking the jalapeno cream cheese, I didn't see it on the top, I found some on the bottom of on half, and what I had tasted good, the burrito itself was topped cheese, too much cheese for my liking also it wasn't crispy, it was soft, but the flavor of the dish was delish! The portions are huge, the beans and rice looked and tasted great! I think next time I will just order tacos, and hope they are not cut in half haha"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place.  The salsa was horrible.  Bland.  Tasteless.  Watery.  Like tomato sauce...or juice.  Food was nothing special either.  Even the margaritas left a lot to be desired.  Service was a little on the slow side and their patio is depressing.  I'm not sure why so many people like this place.  There are way better Mexican restaurants out there.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Don't go here. I would rather be gutted in a medieval torture room, have my heartbroken 3 times by the same person, live on the street for the rest of my life than eat at this shithole again. From the very onset of our visit when the waitress who poured our water didnt even understand simple english (meaning our questions fell on deaf ears), I knew this would be a disaster. After ordering from an unappealing menu, we waited for a bit until I started to feel itchy. Looking around, there were mosquitoes everywhere. Confused, I turned around only to find we were seated right next to a trashbag. When I asked the waitress (a different girl) about it, all she had to say was \"yeah they come around a lot at this time it sucks haha.\" Wow, thanks for pointing out the obvious! Im no idiot, I've lived in AZ, and most indoor places do not have mosquitoes socializing around every table like some sort of insect rave. Instead of doing anything about it, my complaint fell on dead ears while I tried to enjoy my food despite having to scratch my arm like some sort of flea infested cat. Unfortunately, the food itself was awful. I had the \"Pollo Rico\" and although I am not proficient at spanish, I now realize that \"rico\" probably means \"bullshit.\" Bland, uninspired dishes with nothing that stood out made the already awful experience shittier. Do not go to this hellhole. Do it for me if not yourself."}
{"text":"This is a place you go when you're wanting chips and salsa, beans, cheese, tortillas etc. and you don't feel like driving farther to the Mexican places you absolutely love.

There is nothing \"wrong\" with Nando's- it's just very mediocre and very much Americanized , chain-style Mexican food. There is nothing memorable about any of their dishes. I don't hate it- we just end up going here when we feel like settling. 

**It has been a couple of years since I reviewed Nando's, and I would now give them 4 stars. ****
The service here is always very attentive, even when the restaurant is busy. (Which is most of the time!) I used to find that the meat in my burritos and quesadillas was tough or over cooked, but they've really remedied this problem. In fact, the meat in the chicken/beef quesadillas is consistently moist and tender. Nando's is doing a great job!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best mexican food reastraunt in the valley!!! I would reccomend trying to Pollo Rico or Down south chimi. Always great service."}
{"text":"Hands down the best mexican food reastraunt in the valley!!! I would reccomend trying to Pollo Rico or Down south chimi. Always great service."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!! Staff is very welcoming and helpful! They have a fantastic happy hour, prices are not bad. I went a lot when I was pregnant and the kitchen never had an issue for changing mine from corn to flour tortillas."}
{"text":"We HAD eaten here several times before and NEVER again!!! Terrible service & cold food! When we told the waiter our food was cold he actually stuck his finger in it to check then said ok I'll bring you another \" hot\" one. The manager brought use a new one basically calling us a liar!! She said did we know that the lettuce makes it seem cold.... really?????? Never going back!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Teresa did an amazing job taking care of 30 pain in the butt engineers with grace. Thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"The food isn't very good. I had ordered a quesadilla and the cheese wasn't even melted. The only food item that was good were the chips and salsa.

The margaritas on the other hand are delicious! The bartender made some awesome drinks. I ordered a grateful dead and he actually knew how to make it! I've been to other bars asking for that drink and they never made it right."}
{"text":"Called in yesterday to order a take out of my usual eat in. Hostess over the phone asked what kinda sauce I wanted with the El hefe. Wow, I've never been asked, so I said red and extra sauce if they could do it. Low and behold, red sauce buck fifty. Extra sauce buck fifty. Took food back for a refund. Don't ask for upgrades if you don't say it costs more. It may be extra money if you get people to add on to their order, but let them know ahead of time."}
{"text":"Why do so many people support mediocre high priced food? This place couldn't be more bland and not worth the calories or expenditure."}
{"text":"Great service and fabulous happy hour specials that easily make a fun delicious dinner for two!"}
{"text":"We were forced to give this place a second chance and I'm glad we did.  It's really grown on us and it's tough to beat that patio on a nice day!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good beer selection but the food has no taste.  I've given it 3 tries now but won't be going back."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  Had the combo plate with taco, enchilada, and tamale.  So much food for the price.  Chips excellent slightly salted and very thin.  Great salsa and hot sauce.   Great customer service"}
{"text":"2 stars because the service was good, and the food came out hot and quick.  Other than that...the food was very flavorless.  I had the fajitas..chicken had no flavor or seasoning. The steak has no seasoning and was burnt as were the onions."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Nandos for years. It's very close to my home and a convenient meeting place for friends and family. When I say \"years\", I mean at least once a month for a decade. 

I have resisted writing this review because I thought it would feel traitorous. I'm over that. My wife has suggested Nandos several times in the last months and I've said: \"I'm done for now.\"

First, let me say that the staff are great. My only beef is with the decline in quality of one specific item. That item is the shredded beef taco (SBT). To me the SBT is the quintessential casual Mexican fare. It's the standard by which I judge all Mexican restaurants. It's what I look forward to the moment thoughts of Mexican food enter my head. My standard order at Nandos was always El Numero Uno (Two Tacos with Rice and Beans). They were so good back in the day.
It's been about 18 months that I've found the Nandos SBTs lacking. They are now bland with very, VERY little flavor. You're getting texture from the meat, but not much else, except a hint of the deep fryer oil (and that's not a good thing). You have to add flavor by adding salsa.

But I have a simple suggestion, a really quick fix, that I hope Nandos adopts (or returns to). Here's the discovery story:  My daughter recently returned home from college. On the way home from the airport she suggested we stop in to Nandos (what are ya gonna do?). 

Hope springs eternal... I ordered the bland tacos. Now, you don't have to specify they be bland... they just come that way regardless. I wish it weren't so. Truly I do. 

Alas, at first bite, my hopes were dashed. I began the ritual of heaping more regular- and habanero-salsa on my tacos to make them palatable. I should have ordered the shrimp/beef fajitas or the Hatch Green Chile Pork burrito (those are excellent tasty options that I would never have tried had the tacos not gone into quality decline). But, dammit! I want tacos... the good tacos I used to get here.

My wife got her standard shredded beef enchiladas. My daughter got a shredded beef chimichanga. Both enjoyed their meals but had much to take home in takeout containers. 

The discovery came the next day when I reheated my daughter's leftover chimi. I discarded the deep-fried flour tortilla and tried a forkful of the shredded beef. Oh, lordy. It was exactly as I remember the SBT meat had been seasoned back in the day. It was excellent.

So, please, all at Nandos - owner, servers, bartenders, kitchen staff - please please please use the seasoned beef in the shredded beef tacos, the same shredded beef as goes into the shredded beef chimi. Please taste test the two items side by side and you will see what I mean.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to rewriting this review."}
{"text":"I only come to this place for one thing - the Pollo Rico! MmMMmm - Good!  Service is pretty good and the prices are not bad either."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 7 years and it is my go-to Mexican restaurant in AZ. Whenever Is have friends or family in town and they are craving Mexican food, I always direct them to this great place. Service has always been top notch. Food quality and quantity is phenomenal, and the menu items are appropriately priced. It makes me feel good when I see the restaurant's namesake, Nando, on site and working amongst the staff. If Mexican food is on your mind, do yourself a favor and visit Nando's. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service is what really makes me love this place.  It is spot on, and you're never feeling irritated with the waitstaff.  I've been at least four times now, and I've felt that the service was perfectly consistent and awesome each and every time.  So, Nando's, keep it up.

Like the boy referenced below, we have a hard time finding a place that both of us really enjoy eating at.  I'm a vegetarian and he is a steak and potatoes kind of guy so we're always trying to figure out a place that we'll both be happy with.  He found Nando's on Yelp one fateful Sunday night and we've been making the trek out to Gilbert ever since.

He raves about the amount of steak he finds in his Mexican entrees, and I enjoy the cheesy mushroom and spinach enchiladas.  The spicier salsa does it for me- as well as the warm chips that are served as an appetizer.

I always longingly look at the patio- and temperatures are warming up so I'm sure that we'll be dining on the patio soon enough.  The wrought iron decor throughout the restaurant is pretty sweet.

A great, solid Tex-Mex kind of spot with lots of choices and wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Ok...It's not Los Dos...(you know what I am talking about).  It's not El Charro or Blue Adobe.  It's the best thing we got in NE Mesa.  Never fail....get the cheese crisp. They know how to do a cheese crisp.  Yes, the salsa is ok, but drink more cerveza's.  My brother is a chef....for some reason he like the green chili burro's...he's been gone for over 5+......so that might have skewed his judgement.  The place is inviting, definitely a neighborhood place.  Make sure to tell them go light on the sweet n sour mix...other than that, the marg's are good.  The portions are huge.  You will not leave hungry here.  Salute!"}
{"text":"One of our local favorite hangouts. Fajitas are very good, pollo rico is amazing. Always plenty of chips and salsa. The perfect storm margarita is one of the best margaritas I've had north of the Mexican border, period. Above average Tequila selection, especially for a place that is restaurant first and bar second. Wait staff is friendly and prompt, but don't always know the menu. Manager is very good and often comes by to check on guests or drop off a complimentary shot of anejo ;)"}
{"text":"Made my third visit to this restaurant.  Each time the food has been quite good and very plentiful.  Very big portions.  Wait staff very friendly (with one exception) and service is fast.  Value is excellent.  Many lunch specials for $8.95 which includes rice and beans - and chips and salsa to start.  Each time, I've only been able to eat about 1/2  of my entree and taken the rest home.  

The only negative is that we showed up for lunch and the hostess didn't bother to come to her podium for almost 5 minutes after we arrived.  Then, when she did, she was not friendly at all - actually seemed put out that she had to attend to seating us... once to the table, she dropped the menus on the table and left without a word.  She clearly doesn't like her job.  Very strange, since everyone else I've encountered at the restaurant has been more than friendly.  So, memo to the restaurant manager: replace your lunchtime hostess.  It's the first impression people get of your restaurant and you probably don't want that impression to be one of rudeness.

Also, they have a large outdoor patio. Overall I enjoy this restaurant and will go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner Sunday night service was quick and accurate my pork burrito just the average Mexican fare the rice beans were average. My wife said that her steak tacos were good chips and salsa were ok as well the place was busy so I'm just chalking this one up to me being to picky."}
{"text":"Came for a quick breakfast bite and a mimosa. Beans and tortillas. CANNED beans. MIssion brand thick flour tortillas. \"Manager\" came out and argued with us. Swore on her father's grave the beans were not canned. I'm checking the trash. They are canned beans. So disappointed."}
{"text":"First time at this location.  Ate lunch Monday.  I ordered \"J\" which is a chicken burrito covered with their creamy/spicy cream cheese sauce served with rice and beans.  Really delicious dish and HUGE.  I took 1/2 home and ate it for dinner.  Adorable and pleasant waiter - great service.  Chips and water at our table within 1 minute of sitting down.  Restaurant clean.  No complaints!"}
{"text":"I was shocked to see this place so busy after showing up right after they opened up today, but  after tasting my plate I knew why. I had a chicken enchilada with red sauce,  served with rice. My mom had their spinach enchiladas with green sauce, served with rice and beans. Everything we had tasted was fantastic,  and done to our liking. Our waitress was extremely tentative to our needs, and checked on us numerous times. I was happy to find this little gem today,  and look forward to coming back again in the near future."}
{"text":"This place is great! I went there for the first time yesterday night with a group of 8 people. We went around dinner time which was around 6. We were sat down fairly quickly with a table that everyone could sit and talk with each other. It's a bit dark in there but it has a great environment. There are free chips and salsa (which was super nice that they had both mild and hot salsa). I ordered the chorizo con huveous (which is chorizo with eggs). Their portion is huge! It was only 10 dollars but I definitely left stuffed. It had 2 flour tortilla and also rice and beans. Everything tasted amazing and our server was very nice and professional. He never let us have a glass empty. Definitely will come again!"}
{"text":"We went today (a Saturday) at about 12 pm. We got seated really quickly for an 8 person party. The area we were directed to was one closed on room with bench seats, so everyone had to scoot in. 

The wait staff were very nice. And although, it was the weekend, we still got lunch specials. 

The chips were warm and the salsa was delicious! Everyone was happy with their food. Even though it was lunch specials, the portions were huge. I got a taco salad with chicken, but the chicken overpowered the salad. It was more chicken than salad. But still very good. 

Definitely will go back again!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant! We brought some friends here recently who are now fans as well! The service is always friendly and the good is fantastic, no matter what you get."}
{"text":"Today.......COMPLETELY disappointed in the lack of acknowledgment from the staff as we sat and waited for a seat. Several staff members walked by us WITHOUT any acknowledgement of our presence. Finally one waitress (thin, older dirty-blonde with glasses) COMPLETELY acknowledged the couple standing next to us. That couple was kind enough to point our way. This waitress acted like we were still not there. 

I completely felt discriminated against."}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley! The staff is always wonderful and food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I wish I could put into words how much I love Nando's. My then boyfriend and I went there when they first opened, and continued to go there while we dated. We chose to have our rehearsal dinner on their patio in the Fall of 2014. What a beautiful atmosphere, great food spread out like a buffet, and amazing customer service. All of our guests were impressed. There is a sentimental place in my heart every time we go there now for dinner (which is sometimes just a quick happy hour at the bar). I love Nando's! Best chips and salsa ever."}
{"text":"Nothing unique about the place other then you get alot of food for the price.  Dishes are pretty messy and covered in cheese but tasty.  Not the healthiest place to eat and nothing creative about the foood but if your on a tight budget and want to pig out, I'd choose this place.  Good place for friends to hang out, I'd like to try the margaritas."}
{"text":"Chimichangas were good. My family also got taco salad. I really liked the salsa. Typical Mexican that hits the spot! Looking forward to coming back to get a marg.. There is also happy hour."}
{"text":"I love Nando's! Whenever I'm in charge of coordinating a group dinner, 9 times out of 10, this is the restaurant I choose. You would have to be the pickiest eater on the planet, to leave here less than satisfied. - So far, every single person I've had the pleasure of introducing to Nando's, has also nominated this restaurant to be one of their local staples.

The style of food here is gringo-Mexican. This isn't typically the what you'd be served in Mexico, but it's not an embarrassing attempt such as somewhere like Taco Bell. It's a happy medium, with lots of cheese, and large portions. 

The majority of the time, I order the Baja Shrimp Salad. I know, I know, ordering a salad at a Mexican joint is sacrilege; but, I sincerely love salad. Especially theirs. - If I'm super hungry, or I'm just having one of those I-Don't-Care-About-My-Physique Days, I'll get El Numero Cinco: Two Red Cheese Enchiladas(OMG THEY'RE SO AMAZING), Rice, and Beans. It's basically the food equivalent of a warm hug, from someone you really love. 

Every. Single. Visit. My boyfriend sees it as a challenge to finish his entire meal, usually El Numero Cinco, and fails. I love his enthusiasm, but you have to be able to put some serious food down, in order to clear a plate here. Basically, don't get too confident while ordering. You will be humbled!

Okay, their breakfast is my favorite breakfast on the entire planet. It's served only on weekends, which works for me, since this is the only time I'd generally go out for breakfast. Please get The Vaquero. It's everything you could ever ask for in a dish. Eggs, Pico, Carne Asada, Cheese and Avocado. Please sign me up! Don't even get me started on their awesome Bloody Mary's. Only $3 and they know how to make 'em! - There's a portion of the breakfast menu with more \"traditional\" breakfast items, if you're not trying to sample an entire butcher shop on one plate.

Shockingly, over the past 7 years I've frequented this location, I have only once had to wait for a table. Despite how busy the parking lot may look, it's unlikely you'll have to wait. - I mean, unless you have a party of like 15.

You'll never encounter a rude employee, and your food will always come perfect. If you've been driving by and wondering about this place, go in, and thank me later."}
{"text":"Been coming to nados for a long time until tonight!! Ordered a taco and cheese enchilada! Took a bite of the taco and it was sour!! I had to vomit in the bathroom!! The thing that really upsets me is the only thing the manager did was take it off the bill!! The whole meal was spoiled!!! Will never go there again!! She blamed it on the tortilla!!!
That was a Lie!!! My girlfriend smelled the meat and it smelled rotton!! And tasted rotton!! Long time customer!! Last time there!!!!"}
{"text":"I've always loved nandos but I think having it to go was a bad idea, everything was a little soggy and I think they changed their salsa and I'm not a huge fan. Plan to go back and eat in the restaurant and hope the outcome is more normal and delicious"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, and especially good service from Steven!  It's our go to place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to this Nando's in a long time because the Chandler store is much closer.  The service was mediocre and the food wasn't nearly as good as it was in the past nor as good as the Chandler store.  My wife's taco came out cold.  We sent it back and they returned it and my wife said the taco didn't taste good and there was only half the amount of chicken compared to when it initially came out.

We'll stick to the Chandler store on Dobson and Germann."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now, once for in dining and the other take out. This will be a combo of the two together!

Decor- I honestly like the decor here, it's very simple and relaxed. At night, the lights go down and it becomes very comfy. Seats and tables are nice, and they do have a waiting area, it gets busy!!

Food- For a chain Mexican restaurant I'm not mad. I moved from California where Mexican food is plentiful and amazing. I had the chimichanga and I loved it. The steak and pork is seasoned really nicely. The price point is about average for the amount food. Main entrees come with rice and beans. The take out I had one small incident where they forgot to give me my whole order, but that's the only complaint I have.

Service- So I went on a weekend, and it was slammed. Expect to wait 30 minutes or more. The servers try really hard to get to everyone, and I completely understand. At least they give you free chips and salsa!!

Overall- For being a California transplant looking for amazing food, I loved it. If you haven't tried it, give it a shot. Go during lunch so you don't have to wait long."}
{"text":"We've eaten here probably five times now and each time it's just ok. Their menu seems rather limited compared to typical Mexican restaurants. The servers always seem rushed and impatient. The food is good enough, but nothing to write home about. The atmosphere is nice but not fancy. Last time we went our chairs were really wet (must've been wiped down with a dripping rag), there were empty sugar packets on the floor that no one picked up, they didn't have any Stella, and our quesadillas were mushy (had to send them back to be grilled) so I'm thinking we probably won't go back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places...well used to be but now you can't park anywhere.  Have tried 3 times this week but between CB&CB, Oregano's and a few other places...there is no parking.  Guess we'll keep going to El Palacios."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place to go and eat, if you want decent Mexican food. Staff is pretty friendly, but service is a little slow on average. I don't blame them, it does get packed. Food is pretty decent. It's definitely not the best, but it doable. I've catered from here as well, and thought it was good. I think it's a little over priced for the quality of food you get.

Short and simple review. Overall 3/5."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service, but the food was disappointing. Definitely not the place to go to for authentic Mexican food. The salsa was very bland and the beans tasted canned and had a sour aftertaste to them. The rice had barely any flavor. I did order a chicken taco that wasn't bad...but not great. Over all, this is probably a great spot for happy hour on the patio, but not for dinner. What I was impressed with was the service, they were staffed properly which made our meal very pleasant and worth the sub-par food."}
{"text":"Nandos has been sitting in plain site just 5 minutes from my house.
Heard about it from a friend.
So we went.......on friday in July....for happy hour. MISTAKE!!
Packed solid, not a parking space anyw here so we turned tail to panera bread close by.  Their parking lot is tight so be warned.
PLAN B ...... we went at 430pm on a thursday. 1/2 packed with cheap tecate beer special. I had the happy hour ultimate nachos. Whoa.....seriously......enough for 3 people!! Not a joke in size but tastey.

My wife enjoyed the happy hour pizza.
The bar area servers were stretched thin but did a good job. By 530 it was packed, loud and bustling. 
The table chips n salsa were standard in taste. 

Go off hours and enjoy your meal or go at peak hours and enjoy no parking and a loud, bustling atmosphere. Prices seem to run a bit high which is why the Happy Hours are packed..
I definitely need another visit......but quickly because snowbird season is approaching. Cant even imagine!!

Update: 2/22/18  just had the fajita philly cheese steak....what a great sammich!!  I also had 2 tecate beers in  frozen glasses......talk about heaven !!"}
{"text":"Giant portions of good food.  The patios are separated into smoking and non-smoking sections (nothing is worse than smelling cigarettes while you're dining out), and space heaters are sprinkled throughout just incase you're a bit chilled.

Chips and Guac are a must.  The fajitas are delicious."}
{"text":"Nandos is a nice place to go for a meal. The service was excellent. The portions were large. The fajitas my wife had were excellent. The Mexican pizza was very good. The chips and salsa were great. My meal was good not great. The rice was very average. The cheese on my meal was more of a Colby jack as opposed to a nice white Mexican cheese. The atmosphere was very pleasant and the place was hopping on a Friday night. I would go back."}
{"text":"Rico, the bartender, was awful. He was rude, failed to offer drink refills, and was slow giving us the check."}
{"text":"This place is my least favorite Mexican food place in the area. Several bad experiences with the food have led me to rate it a 1."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. My favorite is the Pollo Rico. Came in during happy hour for a take out order, the bartender was extremely nice and friendly. I already love this place but the service I got today was outstanding for just a takeout order."}
{"text":"Oh god! No!! Terrible!! No flavor in the food or drinks! The margharitas were sooo weak!! Everyone I know who has gone hated it!! There are enough good Mexican restaurants on the East side don't waste your times here! But then again...its slim pickings this far out east mesa. The service wasn't great either."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday during happy hour and got the chili verde pork burro enchilada style. Omg! One of the best I've had ever! Huge chunks of slow cooked tender pork. No fat, just perfect. Also had awesome Blap Blap Belgiun wheat beer, ice cold. Clean place and friendly staff. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Mother's Day on Nando's huge Patio was awesome!  Bloody Marys and delicious food.  The special, Sonoran Benedict, was amazing.  The green chili is also our usual go to breakfast dish here on the weekends.

If Nandos reads this, please consider adding Chilaqules to your breakfast menu.
I'm surprised its not on there since its such a great Mexican breakfast dish.

Best breakfast in Mesa!"}
{"text":"I've given this place a 5-star review in the past but today the service was AWFUL. Food was ok but a water and a coffee took 7-10 minutes to bring out. The coffee was COLD and when we requested new coffee we were informed they were out of decaf (and no apology was even offered)."}
{"text":"We went here and had the 3 item lunch special with a green chili burrito it was so yummy.  Also, we got the Pollo Rico lunch special and that was so yummy too.  We got a lot of food.  The place was clean, the food was really good and the service was good.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Totally grossed out! My family went for dinner and I watched a server deliver a basket of chips and salsa moments after he wiped his nose with the salsa in the same hand. So gross! Then our food was delivered with one of my son's chicken strips hanging off the side. I was going to grab it but the server did instead- with his bare hand and threw it on the plate. I let out server know and she shortly apologized and went on like these things were acceptable. Makes me really question what happens in the kitchen if these took place right in front of me."}
{"text":"Oh baby this is my new favorite back up Mexican food place ! We are loyal serranos customers , but lately we have been needing to change it up a bit and try some new Mexican restaurants.  The Chips are thin and crispy , salsa is tasty both the medium and the hot are great. Service was on point , restaurant was clean , all of the staff we came in Contact with were helpful. I ordered way too much food because I didn't realize their portions were so generous. I was seriously able to take my leftovers home and make 2 more meals out of it. I had the thres ? It was a beef taco, chicken enchilada and green chili beef burrito. All of that for $14 . Man what a bargain. My husband had the steak tacos $14 and said they were amazing . He said that the meat was just like fajita meat and incredibly flavorful . They offer happy hour specials and kids eat free night. Plus they offer free kiddo dinners with good report cards . This place is very family friendly , and I appreciate finding a little gem like this ."}
{"text":"Definitely not authentic mexican food, but it is ok.  Servers don't pay attention to detail.   Margaritas are so good."}
{"text":"Having just moved from California, I found myself on a quest from Mexican food in the chandler area. Entering Nando's I was immediately impressed with the ambiance that's reminiscent of a Mexican cantina designed in Disney land. 

Unfortunately, first impressions were not an accurate representation of the quality of the food. The salsa was  mediocre and the chicken in my tacos was completely over slated, making the beans and rice the star of my plate. 

All in all, if you solely gauge your eatery by its ornamental value, this would be a good venue for you."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always order something different for food and everything I've had has been delish! But the real reason i go here: Cabo Wabo Margarita! yummy!"}
{"text":"Great place to come with friends.  CHEAP happy hour specials such as the giant Nachos, yum :)  Enormous servings, I'm not kidding.  The guacamole appetizer is giant as well, so be careful you bring other people with you or else you will end up wasting yo foods.   

Come in, try something different each time you visit and find what you like!  I like the guac, nachos, and tostadas, delicious!"}
{"text":"It is such a big turn off when your server has no clue about the food she is serving you. Please educate your staff about the ingredients so that your customers can come back again."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the fuss is about.  I would place it a notch below Serranos.  I ordered the chicken taco combo and honestly was a little overwhelmed with all the cheese.  It was good, but nothing to go out of my way for again."}
{"text":"Gina is a great waitress.  Have eaten there now three times, fair at best.  The shredded beef is tough.  The rice is boring and the salsa and chips very boring.  Youg might ask why do I go because other people choose the place and I was hoping I might find something I could say was good. We had the fried Ice cream and what should have been nice and crispy(corn flakes) was soft and chewy because they were pre made and kept frozen till ordered."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to come here a lot- at least once every couple of weeks. This past year we have only gone once. The food just isn't as good as it used to be. I don't know what changed (maybe our taste?) but it's just not the same. The salsa is just ok, and the guac is gross- it has to be store bought...if not, I'd like to talk to the person who makes it. Beyond that, the rice, beans, margaritas, etc- they're all just ok. It doesn't taste like authentic Mexican food to me. 
The redeeming qualities for me are the service and the pollo rico- both are great. We have always had good experiences with service, and the pollo rico is always a safe bet. I'm not quite ready to give up on Nando's since it used to be a staple for us, but I definitely won't be going any more frequently than I have been."}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars.  I enjoy the food here, have never had a bad meal, and the chips and salsa are so good.  The problem I have with this Nandos is the service.  First off, they are always busy.  I view this as a good thing, but it has long wait times for a table.  To avoid this, I called ahead and made a reservation for 7 people at a ceertain time. I have 3 children and no one likes to wait with tired hungry kids.  They offered me the hideaway room, so i took it.  When we showed up at our reservation time, they had seated that table and said there wasnt another available because they had a party of 18 coming in.  We ended up having to wait for 20-25 minutes for the other party to finish eating so we could have the table because it was so busy there were no other tables.  It took another 7 min or so to clean the table.  Then it took 10 min to get drink orders in.  Our server also got the party of 18, so we barely saw her.  At the end of our meal we were told there was another reservation and they needed our table and we were rushed out, like the later dinner was our fault. The food was as good as always, but its irritating that they accept reservations but don't actually honor them."}
{"text":"I had heard so many great reviews about this place so we took my mother-in-law there for her birthday. Honestly, it was good but not what I was expecting based on the reviews I had heard. They brought out free fried ice-cream for my mother-in-law's birthday, which was nice. It was average Mexican food and average service. There wasn't anything that set it aside from any other average Mexican Restaurant. I can't say anything bad about it but I likely won't go there again."}
{"text":"Saturday, 6/18/2011 around 8pm

Atmosphere: Dark, intimate seating in a large space. You are in your own world at your table with other tables you can see, but cannot hear well. Good for groups and couples alike. 

Service: Friendly, attentive, and well-informed waitstaff. They know what is and what is not vegetarian and they have great recommendations for drinks, food, etc.

The drinks: I ordered the coconut margarita, which was flavorful and not-too-sweet. Nice, smooth house tequila; not the best booze, but certainly not the worst. Each table also has a pitcher of ice water, so you can pour your own water. Great for when you bite into something spicy and you then drain your glass of water and your date's glass of water. 

The food: Chips and salsa while you peruse the menu with an extra thing of hot salsa, so you can customize your spiciness. We ordered the chile con queso dip, el numero nueve (cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco, chile relleno, and rice), and an a la carte bean tostadas.

The queso is definitely not a Tex-Mex queso. A fellow Yelper compared it to the quesos of Austin, TX. Not even the slightest bit true. Nando's queso is a good queso, but it is watery when it first comes out. The chips served with the queso are puffy and great. Don't get me wrong, I will return to Nando's for the queso.

The bean tostadas was huge, great, and cheap. Lots of guacamole on it. Yum.

The nueve combo was HUGE, covered in cheese, and very, very hot. The shredded beef taco was a great suggestion from our server! My date ended up taking 2/3 of his meal home because he couldn't finish it. 

Overall, this is a solid Tex-Mex restaurant. Large (HUGE) portions, good drinks, queso (!!!!), and a great a la carte menu where you can order a ton of food for about $5 each. Oh, and lots of vegetarian options with good (meaty and cheesy) food for meat-loving dates."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Our new go to for Mexican food. We went for lunch and they were BUSY. The manager sat us right away and the server was right behind him. Service was super fast especially considering how busy they were and very friendly. Lunch portions were huge and tasted fantastic! Can't wait to get me some more Nandos, we'll be back for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Alexis and I have eaten great Mexican food!   We remember when Mi Amigos was good.  Garcia's the restaurant that all others were compared against.  It has been a long time and we have eaten at a lot of places trying to find a replacement.  Nando's is not only the replacement but we have stopped looking for great Mexican food.   We have found it.  

I could spend hours describing how good each one of the dishes we have tried is.  Instead we will state that there has no dishes that weren't just great!  Our favorite is the the Chile Con Queso Dip.

Anyhow, good food, great people, great restaurant."}
{"text":"We are not only hooked on the outstanding food at Nandos but more importantly the outstanding service we receive each time we visit from Gina!  Gina is efficient, friendly and very knowledgable regarding the menu.  Can't wait for my next meal!"}
{"text":"Best nandos ever! The food is SO good! We went out to dinner with friends and our server was Charlene and I have to say she's probably the best server I've ever had in my life. She kept our drinks full the entire time and our friend spilled a little salsa on his shorts and she brought him a napkin and a separate glass of water to clean it off without even seeing it or him asking for it. She even labeled our to go box with what was in it and today's date. She's amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the East Valley!  Dining in or take-out, service is always very good."}
{"text":"Always great service but I've only sat in the bar area. There salsa is ehhh almost like tomato paste with some pepper and I do not eat spicy at all. I do 100 percent suggest  asking  for Zane's nachos with steak you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Took my son there for lunch as I'd heard a whole lot about Nando's from my colleagues at work. And when i found out there was a a Chandler location, I wanted to check it out. I loved their decor with the Mexican ceramic tiles! So colorful. Even the ladies room was done up with the tiles! Yes, it was very clean too :)

Their chips and salsa were fabulous!!! I has to ask them to take the chips away from me! 
The entrees were huge! Seriously big platters! I had gotten the 2 enchilada platter - and I had rice and veggies with it. Those grilled veggies were seriously delish! The enchiladas were good too - but nothing to super rave about. Maybe next time I should try a speciality rather than a standard menu item.
I don't drink so can't tell you about their alcoholic beverages but people were at the bar - at 3pm on a weekday if that gives you any indication ;)

My son and I both enjoyed the food and our afternoon at Nando's!"}
{"text":"First time there and it was great. Had 6 of us and we got seated right away. Love the fact they put out little carafes of salsa two kinds and a huge basket of chips. Yum yum. The service was very good. I had a Montana margarita on the rocks it was very good. I also had their crab and shrimp enchiladas, they were very very good. We all had an excellent time and if they had these in California I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place. I am a new customer (going the last few months), as I have read some of the other reviews they may have been having some issues with quality or their cook a year or so ago, but whatever they are doing now keeps me coming back. 

I love the decor, and staff are always attentive and respectful, and the place is always busy (good sign). Drinks are always refilled in a timely manner, the margaritas are always cold and delicious. 

The Jalapeno bean dip and the enchilada style chicken burrito will always have a special place in my stomach from this place. I must reiterate, the chicken here is AMAZING, any dish you get with chicken on it you will love, whatever they are doing, just keep doing it and I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"If you like eight legged critters crawling around on our plate then you will love this place!  Three people came out and acknowledged this and still charged me full price!  Hope this this helps the future yelpers."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm over my abhorrence of Mexican food, since it looks like the only way I can stay with my Mexican food crazy wife for the next 38 years is to succumb to her desires for the cuisine every so often.  So I've found a few things I can tolerate as long as I have lots of margaritas to go with it!  So Teresa took care of me first with a large frozen one, and my wife had two on the rocks with her meal.  We finally made it to our western destination, which was Chandler, and were glorying in our arrival.  I had nachos with jalapenos, green onions and shredded chicken covered in white cheese sauce.  My wife went for the more traditional pollo rico, a chicken burrito with cheese sauce served with rice and beans, as usual.  A very nice welcome to two weeks in Chandler!"}
{"text":"So much food, but so good. So pricing first ,
1. 1 Margarita (didn't have it)
2. Mini Shrimp Chimi (so good shrimp cream cheese, o so lovely)
3. El Hefe chimi ( so big , yo the grill chicken they put in this monster was so much meat , plate was packed)
4. Number 7 I didn't have it but plate was FULL

Every thing came out to about 50 dollars, I would recommend skip the drinks , and appetizers if you want to save money , (shrimp chimi is good tho) and just get the entre you will be get plenty of food.
I just like to say this, each plate was huge and not filled with easy fillers , I mean they really give you a meal. Also additional boost the night we went they gave part of each sell to the honor society to help kids travel for education trip so credit to you. Great place and must try."}
{"text":"corner~~corner~~corner!!! that is what my family listened to while trying to enjoy a wonderful~~use to be~~nandos!!! nando's was our family favorite, but now for the last two visits, there has been major changes for the worst!!! the pollo rico was ordered by three of my family members, all of them stated that it tasted like can chicken!!! i always order the seafood enchiladas which they are always awesome, but the bay shrimp was hard as a rock!!! icould state four more \"mistakes\" that happened, but i am not hear to vent, but to explain to other external guests that nando's has two other locations!!! we will be trying out the mcdowell location next!"}
{"text":"My family and I chose to eat here while visiting relatives in Arizona. With all of the people outside waiting to be seated, I thought maybe we made a great choice. We didn't have to wait very long for a table, our service was ok, the chips and dip were great but I was disappointed with what I ordered: shredded beef burro with black beans. The portions were perfect; however, the food was bland - nowhere near enough seasoning. Despite this experience, I wouldn't mind giving Nando's another try."}
{"text":"It's nice, it's clean, it's about average for an AMerican Mexican resturant.  Doesn't strike me as all that authentic but my husband, who leans more towards the AMricanized Mexican food absolutely LOVES the Sonoran Enchilada.  He calls it \"Mexican beefy goodness\" and we make special trips from AJ just to get it.  Personally, and I can always find something there to eat, think it's just ok."}
{"text":"I was meeting my wife for lunch at Wildflower Bread Co at Valvista & Baseline. There was no parking & looked like a long wait. I saw Nandos on the way in so I suggested that we try it out. We were seated immediately & were served chips & salsa. Drinks were ordered & quickly served. The waitress was pleasant. I ordered the lunch fajitas and wife ordered the beef chimichanga. Lunch arrived in 15 min & fajitas were sizzling. It was a ton of food! The platter was so hot the meat was already burning so I quickly pulled the meat off the platter & put it on the vegetables. The meat was very dry and tough. It had absolutely no flavor. Wife said that her chimi tasted like it was covered with sausage gravy. She said that the taste was so-so. The chips were great and salsa was good. The guacamole was good. Good fajitas are very important to me so I won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"Had dinner at nandos tonight, we always go thinking we are super hungry and end up only eating a few bites... I always feel so bad bc I feel that we are rushing our server and I don't mean to.. we had Charlene tonight and she was the best.. went above and beyond what she needed to do.. we definitely appreciate it!  She was busy but that didn't stop her from going the extra steps to making the dining experience awesome. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Though some picky foodies turn their noses up on the americanized, overly cheesy, ginormous portions at this cafe...this is why this place is great! From the strong and flavorful margaritas to the burrito smothered with jalapeño cream cheese (I could bathe in this stuff), we have not had a bad meal here. Service has always been on point and the atmosphere is always laid back and inviting. So sniff at the chips all you want, I will gladly take your portion! :)"}
{"text":"Went there today because my wife wanted Mexican food. I have never been to nando and she had. Food 1 on 10 and service 2 on 10. Very very disappointed. Server Adri got me the wrong order only find out when I got the bill that she didn't get me what I ordered. I could not tell because I do not know their menu... I ordered the picado dinner and she got me the tacos pescado .. they definitely need new cooks as this food was tasteless. I would choose Taco Bell over them. The people that were more into it was the bussers. They were on top of cleaning and ready for next guest.  I work in the industry and I know when my food is bad. And this place is pricey for the crap they serve. Anyway I DO NOT RECOMMEND nando for people who want to experience Mexican food. Bad bad bad and no manager around checking on tables. Where are the managers? If any?"}
{"text":"Took out of town guests.  Service was good.  The chips and the cheese crisp were amazing.  HOWEVER I ordered carnitas...I have never had such dry and tasteless carnitas.  They were able to get me something else...Burrito, taco and tostada.  The taco meat was super duper salty.  I brought most of it home and ending up throwing it away.  I didn't want to waste the calories on bad mexican food.
They service was good and attentive.  Just sad about my meal."}
{"text":"Finding good mexican food is surprisingly difficult,  but my husband and I love Nandos.  I always get the quesadilla with vegetables or their pollo rico burrito.  I love their jalapeno cream cheese! We also get their chile con queso dip, which is delicious."}
{"text":"Come for the food stay for the many types of margaritas! Our favorites are the Mexican Pizza and Pollo Rico ...try not to get full on the delicious chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Portions are big, staff is attentive and kind, food was good but not great, some of the dishes on the table were dirty, I would have given a 4 star if the glass ware was a little cleaner."}
{"text":"Yum!!! 

When our friends were trying to think of a Mexican place to take us for dinner they asked us questions like, \"do you guys like spicy food?\" and \"do you guys like cheese?\" The cheese won!!

I had the spinach enchiladas and the bf had some sort of chicken thing, chicken rito maybe. All covered in cheese!! The rice and beans were excellent and the amount of food was insane! We all took home a box filled with enough food for 4 people. The margaritas were also very good. Oh, I cannot forget the chips. They were hot and fresh and severed with delicious salsa."}
{"text":"Amazing Margaritas and beer selection. Highly recommended, bartender Zane makes a great drink! First time here we'll be back"}
{"text":"We go to Nando's frequently and I love it.  Their salsa is great and if you like hot, ask your server for it! We typically split the chicken fajitas and there is plenty for two.  The patio is nice and spacious."}
{"text":"Missy F. and I had planned to meet up for dinner at a neighboring restaurant tonight, but it was packed to capacity thanks to the Cards game. 

When Missy suggested Nando's as an alternative, I ran with it - It's been 3 years since that icky Chimichanga, maybe things are better now?

Glad we went! 

The service was a bit spotty when it didn't seem to be too busy, but nothing unforgiveable. 

I'm still not a big fan of their mild salsa; however, requested the Spicy Habañero one just to see. 

Ooooh yes. Plenty of hot this time! 

I ordered the Pollo Rico($14 and change), Missy ordered the Albodinga Soup (we'll let her review it). 

This was essentially a chimichanga filled with chicken, topped with cheese and a jalapeño cream sauce. 

Obligatory rice and beans included.

Massive portion expected; that hadn't changed in 3 years.

While I couldn't detect any jalapeño in the jalapeño cream sauce, it wasn't awful ... Just a little too salty for my tastes. 

The Habañero Salsa made up for the lack of jalapeño, so try adding some! 

What really stood out to me was the chicken.

Last time Andrew C. and I went, we barely had any chicken in our entree, and what scant amount was there was like reheated rotisserie chicken and dry, dry, dry. 

Not this time! The chicken was well seasoned and juicy. 

Even Andrew commented on this when I brought him the leftovers ... And he's probably the biggest Nando's hater known to Yelp, haha!

Overall, you'll find decent Americanized Mexi-Grub and a chill atmosphere. 

It's not an establishment I'd go out of my way for unless someone suggested meeting up again. 

Glad I gave Nando's another shot! +1 star. 

And thanks for dinner, Missy. :D"}
{"text":"The happy hour here is really lively and the food is good but not the best Mexican. There is pretty tough competition for that crown. I always test Mexican food restaurants with the Chile Relleno with rice and beans. All are acceptable here but I can't say exceptional. What I will say is that the atmosphere and service are very good and it's a great place to meet friends for  happy hour from 3 to 6pm. You can get pretty happy in 3 hours. The dinner fare is good but not memorable. Still, we keep coming back. I must try breakfast here soon."}
{"text":"Nando's, though practically in New Mexico, offers up the BEST plate of Mexican food I've had in awhile. Like, maybe EVER.

Ambiance:
-impressive. Upscale/classy-casual Mexican dining without the slightest hint of the standard Tecate ads, dusty pinatas or sombreros. 
-smoking and non-smoking patios with plenty of seating
-bar with seating and TVs

Food:
-I ordered the Enchiladas Ongos ($11.75. Misspelling of hongos = mushrooms): 2 corn tortillas stuffed with sautéed mushrooms, onions and cheese. Topped with chipotle cream sauce and Monterey Jack cheese. Served with rice and beans. WOW these were amazing. Big plate, enough for two meals. Very tasty, very cheesy. MUCH WOW. :P
-free chips and salsa have been likened to \"crack\" and it's true, we went through a half dozen bowls at our table. 

Drinks:
-house margarita was strong, but the mix tasted a bit too sweet and soury. Will try something different next time.

Service:
-I honestly could have docked a star or two for the service that others at my table suffered through. They waited almost an hour for their food (granted, we had a table of ~10 people). When I arrived, I ordered and received my food almost immediately.
-several guys helped serve the entrees to the table, when I asked to order I was told that they \"weren't my server\" which I find a bit rude. They could have taken my order and given it to my server (who hadn't been by since I sat down).

I've been bragging about this place non-stop, just wish they weren't out in BFE. Come to the Westside! we have so many Mexican restaurants and you could be El Jefe of them all!"}
{"text":"Second time to a Nandos, first time to the one in Gilbert. We were very impressed with the service and food. Our waitperson, Christie, was very attentive and outgoing. Told us about the menu and made suggestions on what to get. She talked to us everytime she passed our table. What we had was very good. After we finished, she even brought us a small desert.

We have decided that Nandos will be our go to place for mexican style food."}
{"text":"Went to Nandos and was exited because it was a newer mexican restaurant super close to home..and was super disappointed.  The basic chips and salsa they serve at the table were fine, and the drinks were actually really good. I would definitely try some of their frozen margaritas if you do decide to go here. I ordered a chimichanga and was really disappointed...I think the only ingredients in it were steak, onions, and peppers...which actually sounds more like a cheesesteak than a chimichanga. It was also very salty, and I did not enjoy it too much.  In fact, it was one of the worst chimichangas I have ever tasted and usually I am excited when going to a mexican restaurant because I love mexican food. I have yet to go back and try it again...maybe a possible second visit will be better."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Great food wonderful service!! The queso was so amazing. We were visiting from out of town and we are going to miss this place. Some of my family members went a couple times a day. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"We go here to meet up with our Soccer Family after each season.  They love this place, I like this place.  

I don't know if it is due to the large party but the drinks take forever.  And don't get me started on the time it takes to get our food out.

The saving grace are the chips and salsa.  Try the flour tortilla chips.  We always have to ask for more cause they always go quick.  Most of the time we end up eating chips and not finishing our meals.

Everything I ordered here has been good so no hate with that.  This location is clean and service is ok.  Just wish our drinks and food came quicker.  But I think that is the plan to fill up on chips."}
{"text":"We arrived here at about 3:45pm and waited about 5 min for someone to even greet us meanwhile there was about 10 ppl in the restaurant.  The hostess came up and we asked for a table not a booth and she said \"ok, I have one in the bar or outside\". So we went over to the bar area and the two tables were dirty, she then stated \"oh they are dirty so all I have is outside!\" REALLY when it's 105 outside! I asked if she could clean it and she said \"that's not my job I don't clean the tables\" WOW! We left and went to another place that actually cares about their customers!!!"}
{"text":"Nando's will always be one of my favorite restaurants!! I usually go to the Dobson and Germann location. Tonight I went to Val Vista and Baseline for the first time and I actually liked it a lot better. Ben was my server and he was great! Brought my best friend here for the first time with her family. We all had a great time. The food was delicious and like I said, Ben was awesome! I love the atmosphere and the staff! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Now if you like cheese this is the place for you. I almost always order something different and so far my favourite is the Seafood Relleno. A bit odd with the seafood, but it works. Swimming in cheese, luckily its easy enough to push the unwanted cheese to the side. After doing so, I finally get to the pepper itself and all the goodness that it is stuffed with.

The salsa is always good and comes with some hotter salsa that you can either mix with the regular or eat with the warm tortilla chips."}
{"text":"Very yummy mexican food. Great hot sauce..I like to mix the mild n hot together makes the perfect spicyness :D Closest thing to authenic mex food atleast for AZ :P"}
{"text":"We love Nandos! It has become one of our regular dinner spots! The food is consistently good, good sized portions, margaritas are quite yummy, and overall it is pretty cheap! Not the best Mexican food in the world, but pretty good overall and family friendly.

Our favorites (besides the margaritas!): the guacamole, enchiladas ongos (mushroom enchiladas), the pollo rico (YUM!) and the el jefe chimichanga."}
{"text":"Food is decent especially for the prices and the servers are always great. They have a full bar and plenty of drink options. I'd give it five stars if it was amazing but I find it just decent and nice to go to for dinner out with the family. I got the steak fajitas and they were really good. The chips and salsa are really good too! My brother in law got the chicken fajitas but wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Good price. Very quaint. Beautiful inside. Good chips and salsa. Good portions. Not a big fan of the burritos though. I have been here multiple times since my first review and I get their chimichangas. They are amazing. Usually I get ground beef which seems to be the most tasty option. Make sure to get beans and rice on the side."}
{"text":"ok ok after wanting mexican and reading the reviews I had to try this place..I was not disappointed..  the cheese dip amAZing and had quite a kick..portions are big..margarita's right where they needed to be..I'll be back"}
{"text":"First time I went food was great. This last time...food was OK. The reason for the poor review was our server. We had to snag silverware off another table after asking for it and it never came. We asked for more salsa and that never came either until we flagged down another server. I left a $10 tip (right around 15%}. I couldn't bring myself to tip less (I usually tip 20-35%) and chalked up the lack of attention to them being super busy and that isn't the server's fault per se. But then I saw the charge on my card and it seemed high. Like $10 too high. I called and they looked into it. I saw today that they refunded $20 back to my card. So it appears the server decided to tip himself at my expense."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Service during lunch time is a bit slow and the parking lot is not big enough for all the companies in that area."}
{"text":"My favorite part is multiple vegetarian options, this trip I enjoyed spinach enchiladas, not the best I've ever had but very good.  Service was pretty good, I didn't love that we were seated in the bar all by ourselves during a very slow lunch time.

I don't care for the salsa, it's sort of neat that you can add the hot sauce to blend your own heat, since I love heat but I also have a 2 year old who loves salsa.  It was nice to mix him a bowl of a more low key temp and a hot one for use.  Outside of that though the flavor is really lacking, you'll find superior salsa just about anywhere in the valley.  My mom and husband shared the mini combo app so they could get a feel for everything on the menu, they enjoyed it.  Again they said they'd had better but this was good.  

I think we'll return, I love a place that has vegetarian options, and black beans I can eat because they're not cooked in animal fat.  But I'm still on the hunt for better."}
{"text":"Jake the bartender was awesome! Great food, amazing margaritas, and great atmosphere. Will be back soon for more queso!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTE FAVORITE MEXICAN RESTAURANT!!!! We are regulars!! They have great customer service, and will serve you no matter what time it is. I came in an hour before closing and they still sat us and we finished right on time of them shutting the doors. The food is absolutely amazing! I always get a bean and cheese burrito deep fried, and am always excited for the chips & salsa!! The only down side is they close @9 which to me is kind of early. They aren't that expensive when it comes to prices, but they aren't cheap either."}
{"text":"Me and my husband try to eat at new places. We tend to be picky eaters, so this is our way of trying  to broaden our likes. We love mexican so this was this weeks new try. I LOVED it! We started with the jalapeno bean dip and a cheese crisp. The dip was fantastic!!! I loved every bite. The chips they served with it were light and fluffy. Our cheese crisp came out late so they took it off our bill. We didn't even say anything about it, our waitress just said that because it came out 5 after our meal came out that it was on them. Excellent customer service in my opinion. I had lunch special A, a cheese enchilada and a taco with rice and beans. It was great, wasn't anything that made it stand out, but it was very good. Definitely will return, and maybe some friends will join =)"}
{"text":"Generally a good place to eat. The food is served in large portions. They pre-load your table with a basket of chips and a pitcher of water, which is nice. Inga the tacos El carbon which what a huge amount of steak. That was nice. It was basically like a fajitas plate. The taste isn't amazing but it's worth the visit. A good quality meal and good servers attending the guests."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite Mexican restaurants but tonight we were so disappointed. Not enough servers. Food was half hot and half cold. There is a new menu with a substantial increase in prices. So now the price is way too much for the slow service and poor quality. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I'm so surprised people actually like this place. The food is not good, very mediocre. Seems like it's a place that appears to be a new found gem the first couple of visits and then you realize it's not a gem at all."}
{"text":"Seafood Enchilada platter was yummy but a little lite on flavor. 

Chicken Chimichanga was amazing and stuffed with all Savory chicken."}
{"text":"Really craving good nachos so my husband ordered my nachos and his chirizo burrito to go and after arriving he waited 20 mins which is longer than I'm sure it takes to make said items so calling ahead is a waste. The burrito was tiny with the slightest amount of filling with a little shredded lettuce garnish, lovely and my nachos were inedible as the thick layer of cheese on top had been so over cooked it now had the texture of  car tires mmmm yum and everything under was grease soaked and lacked cheese. The worst part is the have zero contact nformation so I can't even tell them how miserable their food is."}
{"text":"Yum Yum! We went here for a family dinner the other night and had a great time. This place was delicious! Their portions of food are HUGE, everything taste wonderful and the staff was great. I dont think there is a thing on the menu that wouldnt taste good. The only reason for 4 and not 5 star was the wait. It seems that this place gets packed for dinner and the staff is running around like crazy trying to accommodate everyone as much as they can. Maybe they need to hire a few more people to help out with the work load? Other than that, stop by and give them a try I dont think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am so sad to write a bad review for this place. I was so excited to try this place. The staff was very nice and friendly and fast. However the food was a different experience. The chips are tasty, the salsa and \"hot\" salsa tasted like ketchup. It was pretty bad. I went with the Pollo Rico. The chicken was so awfully dry I used the ketchup I mean salsa to help it out. Even then it turned into tomato soup. I asked for more hot salsa the waitress told me they have habanero salsa. I asked for some of that....it was ok. The refried beans so so hot however so so bland. They absolutely had no taste. My son was not a fan of his food either....The place it's self is beautiful and they do have a great atmosphere. I will try one more time but after that $20.00 for mexican food between my son and I is not worth it.....sorry =("}
{"text":"My cousin's usual \"hole in the wall\" Mexican  restaurant does not serve beer, so we decided to try Nando's because it was close  and we wanted beer after a 6 hr drive back from LA.  Lucky we were not in a hurry because the service was slow considering the restaurant was not busy. We had to ask twice for our beer and three times for additional salsa!

Fortunately the food was better than the service. I had Alfredo's Green Chile Pork.  The Hatch green chile sauce was great. However, the whole beans were a bit \"crunchy\" for my liking. 

Next time I'm in town I'll go to the \"hole in the wall\" and have a Coke."}
{"text":"The service we received was very good. I would say the food is okay but it's not great.  My taco salad was good but the shell was stale and the kids meal French fries were void of flavor.  Otherwise the food was okay.  We've been here a few times and each experience has been consistently mediocre.  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I... don't get it. I don't get the high rating on this restaurant. Sorry, guys. 

When we arrived, the parking lot was packed, but once inside we were seated almost immediately out on the patio. Unfortunately, we were not seated with menus. Our server visited our table twice before correcting this error. One of our salsa bowls arrived at our table with caked on food bits. After ordering our food, we waited almost an hour for our entrees... which were sincerely lacking in yum.

I ordered the Faja Pasta - so maybe it's partially my own fault for order a pasta dish at a Mexican restaurant - but it was not very good. The pasta was very doughy, and many of the noodles were clumped together. The bread it came with, while not awful, was partially soggy from sitting on the plate too long. Saving grace was the chicken I had with it. It was juicy and had a nice kick. One star for the chicken.

Fiance ordered a seafood enchilada which he found lacking in seafood and smothered in too much cheese. 

We ate until we were full enough to call it a meal. As unsatisfying as it was. 

Second star is for our server, because even though he was a smidge on the slow side, he was trying, bless his heart. He refilled my soda before it was completely empty, so that's a plus for me. 

I don't think we'll be returning."}
{"text":"The customer service is great. This was my first time eating here and my mom told me I had to try it. I had some enchiladas and wow their portions are really huge. They are not greedy with the amount of food they serve you AT ALL lol. I had to actually take some of my dinner home because I couldn't finish it. The food was perfect, the service was excellent, and the environment was very professional and friendly. I will be coming back again for sure."}
{"text":"We frequent the restaurant next door to Nando's, saw this restaurant and thought to give it a try for lunch, especially after seeing reviews. We were greeting with a very friendly staff, but our actual waitress not so friendly, felt a bit of an attitude. Chips, Salsa, and drinks came right away. Atmosphere was nice. We ordered a lunch special: Chile Relleno, Rice and Beans. I thought it was very bland and CHEESE on EVERYTHING, the portions of rice and beans and cheese were huge and the chili Rellenos absolutely no taste. We also ordered the beef Burrito, which was OK tasting, the disappointment was for all the nickle and dimming for the extra charges for sour cream, jalapenos and cheese etc...

OK maybe it was just the Chandler location, but we were not impressed at all, considering there are so many other Mexican restaurants to choose from. If all you care about is portion size (which is huge) and cheese and don't care much about taste then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner a few weeks ago and it was excellent. Unlimited hot chips, great salsa that seems to be made fresh, and the burro's are large and great tasting. No complaints. Ths place does get busy, but the wait is not usually very long."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and each time I'm left with the same mindset.   \"Not great, but not terrible either\".  It's ok in my opinion, but there aren't any better choices in the area so I guess you work with what you have.  If you are craving Mexican food, while there are better places further away you could do a lot worse.  For me nothing stands out as far as flavor. Everything taste just like 100s of other ordinary Mexican restaurants so it's hard to pin point one flaw other than just say everything is average.  

The service is decent so no complaints there. Nice bar and happy hours. Decor is very nice as well.  So in short: overall experience will be enjoyable , food is ok."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican Restaurant in Phoenix! On the main menu, everything is great and consistently great.. My favorite, are the Pork Chops, that have an amazing rub, and can't be beat!! Also, love the happy hour menu.. Price and portions and quality are incredible!! Love their Happy Hour Nachos and Mexican Pizza. $2.00 domestic beers!!! 
Try Nando's. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I love Nando's we drove from Glendale to this location just to have the Pollo Rico and Let me say this the food was good but The service from the time we entered til we left was horrible.  No greeting from the rude hosts who kind of threw our menus at us because we were trying to sit down and she seemed like she was in a hurry. was not busy at the time we went 3 different waiters came to our table none took the order until about 15 minutes later then the waitress checked on us once the entire hour and half we were there. The food is always delish but this time the service sucked big time."}
{"text":"Manders is one of the best places to get fajitas and other Mexican food my fiancé was very very very happy with the size and portion of the fajitas the rice and beans are very good too. We had a waiter that was so awesome he's very attentive and very friendly can't remember his name but he was amazing. Gone there a few times and neverA waiter that was so cool. We love their chips and salsa very relaxed atmosphere they can get busier times but since we live across the street they have our business"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place!! Our first visit here was for breakfast, which was unbelievably delicious. Dinner is just as good. I got the barrio tacos that were very filling and so flavorful. Their chips and salsa are worth it alone to go there. I can't wait to go back and try more items off their menu."}
{"text":"This location is better than the Gilbert location.  It is decent. Nothing spectacular but there are some menu items that I enjoy.  The flour tortillas, however,  don't taste that great.  A good Mexican restaurant needs good tortillas. I have never had to wait long for a table but the parking sucks.  There is a valet service and I guess it's more important to save the good parking spots for them to use."}
{"text":"Dear Nando, I am very disappointed today after visiting this restaurant. I have been out of the country for a year and decided I needed to get my Nando's fix. I used to love this place but now I do not know if I will ever return. The service was terrible. First, the hostess did not know where to seat us. I was confused and she walked us around just as confused until finally deciding on where to put us. Then as we waited for our server we got our chips and salsa from the bus boy. Then we waited...and waited...and waited. Finally, we were asked if we would like anything to drink. I was on the verge of walking out of the restaurant up to that point. I wish I had. After receiving our drink I noticed the server had sat down at a booth to have a conversation with a customer. It appeared he knew him.  I have to admit that my meal was good but my wife ordered a chimichanga that was for some reason, watery. My waiter promptly refilled my soda but at no point did he ever introduce himself or ask us if everything was alright. I felt as if he just wanted us out of there. Then we waited for our bill...and waited...and waited. Finally it arrived and I was so happy to pay because I just wanted to get our of there. Now I sit here wondering if I will ever go back. Perhaps, if I do I will try the other location. I was told that the waiter was training someone but I never saw him interacting with another person as if he was training them. He didn't even offer that as an excuse for his poor performance. Either way, I was sad to see one of my favorite establishments reduced to a place that I do not even want to visit again. So, Nando, I hope that you can get this right. If I ever do return you have a lot of work to convince me to add this establishment to my favorites list again. I hope you can do it because if you do not then you will surely see business leaving for another place that services their customers with a smile and a greeting. A place that shows it cares. A place that shows that we are welcome."}
{"text":"Took another couple out tonight and had the Mexican pizza special.  (Pizza and two drinks for $20).  We sent the first pizza back we split back because it was unevenly heated and cool in spots. Should have given up there. It may have been reheated but that didnt help.  Greasy and so much cheese it was just nasty. Dont bother."}
{"text":"Boring food. Beans tasted like they are from a can. Nice atmosphere. Would rather go somewhere with better Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food is terrible - tastes like the cook is a smoker (too salty). Not very authentic either. Went one time for Happy Hour & figured I'd get a quesadilla along with my drink. Couldn't even finish that - it was just gross. Drinks are nothing to write home about either (although in all fairness, I don't usually do margaritas). Don't know why people come back here - we definitely won't!"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant about 6 times in the past year and never had a bad experience. The food is delicious and served in a timely manner. The environment is well maintained with a friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"That was our 1st visit here , food was good but service was terrible , our server ( Brian as listed on our bill ) never even introduced yourself : hey what are you drinking today ... hey to you too. It's like people don't even know how to communicate these days , we have never even been here you would think guy at least would try go over drink specials or favorite / specialty menu items. Food took forever , we think he forgot to put our order in , it was over an our for fajita and burrito , people who got sat after us already were finishing their plates. We had good portion of food to take home so we asked for boxes , he literally handed me a box straight to my hands bcs there was no space on the table , excuse me , but if you can't find an empty spot on the table how do you expect me to box my own food ? How rude ! And he left without even trying to make some space by taking empty dishes away. Frankly , my bf only tipped him bcs he is nice and this guy didn't even deserve 5% of that bill, just terrible. Next time we ll sit at the bar or hopefully we get someone better, if service will be at the same level we won't be back. You guys are getting 5 stars for food and 1 for service."}
{"text":"After visiting Nando's, I figured out why America is so fat. The portion sizes are HUGE!!! I mean it is easily 4-5 meals worth of food. The guacamole tasted like apple cider vinegar...so not sure what happened there. I had the chimichanga it was very mediocre. The chips and salsa are not good. The salsa has a weird taste, not like a normal salsa. I have 0 desire to ever return. Worst $40 meal ever. 2 entrees. The hostesses were very unprofessional in their behavior, and they told us it would be 5 minute wait and it was closer to 20."}
{"text":"Good food and cheese crisp is the best. I think they fry it first. We sat outside and it was perfect. Great service."}
{"text":"Great service in a great atmosphere.  We often drove by this place next visiting.  I'm so glad we went I this evening.  
Atmosphere: Upscale decor and everything was clean and neat.
Service:  Very attentive and team orietated enviornment.  Everyone was there to service you during your visit.
Food: Fantastic, I they greeted us with bottomless chips and salsa and a pitcher of water, then you order.  The food is ample, I don't reommend trying to eat it all as food coma may result.  The quality is great and very high quality.
Cost: not bad at all, meal, soft drinks and desert was about  $40 for 2 people which is actually average in cost to other less desirable places in the area.
Summary: We found a new place and will not only be back but recommend it to friends.  Great job to the team we dealt with, thank you."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite place to eat! The pollo rico along with the rest of the food on the menu is excellent! The fresh salsa and chips is what keeps me coming back! 

The different flavored margaritas are great too! Try the chocolate nacho's.  I highly recommend Nando's!"}
{"text":"This Mexican joint is legit.  I moved here from Southern California (little Mexico) and I couldn't find anything I thought was good authentic Mexican until I found Nando's. Normally I get the mesquite steak tacos but also will get a chicken taco w chicken enchilada plate. I'm super stoked that they expanded to Chandler. Not sure why they have an overall 4 star rating. I read the other reviews and all that gave 4 stars had nothing but positive things to say??? Anyhow, I've had multiple things to eat here and all were great and the chips and salsa are as good as any! I eat here a few times a month."}
{"text":"Great food. Big bowl of fresh chips and salsa is great. Lunch portions are more than dinner portions at most mexican restaurants. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is THE BEST!  I went here with a meetup group this week.  We were seated in the restaurant because there were 20 of us.  They told us, however, that they would honor the Happy Hour prices until 6 pm which they did.  Those that ordered from the HH menu got huge meals at very reasonable prices.  I saw street tacos (3 tacos per plate) with rice and refried beans and another order of a HUGE nacho platter.  Margaritas and sangria were ordered by several ladies--again at the HH price.

I ordered off of the menu and got a Machaca Tostada with pinto beans and guacamole.  I took half of it home because it was so big.  It was also delicious.

The service was great--we had one waitress for 20 of us.  She was patient and handled us with efficiency.  I was impressed!  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. The service was extremely slow. It took several minutes, I'd guess about 15, for someone to take my order, and then another 15 or 20 minutes for the order to get to my table.  The food was very good but don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Great food and service, reasonable priced beer! My wife had the spinach enchiladas which she loved. I had the beef and chicken enchiladas which were outstanding. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and mediocre food. We've tried to like Nandos but unfortunately we never have good service and the food is just okay. Our last visit we waited  10 minutes to get service, they were not willing to accommodate a very simple request, and the food was very plain."}
{"text":"We ordered the Pollo Rico. It was great. Our waitress, Bianca was good. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"If you like bland food covered in a TON of cheese and horrible service, then this is the place for you! Because of the excessive amount of cheese used, everything is SUPER greasy. In addition, I ordered a margarita and it tasted so bitter I could barely tolerate it. Water glasses are the size of shot glasses and dirty. Waitress was bitchy and looked like she had been up all night boozing. All around horrible experience and I'll never go again."}
{"text":"Tonight we ate here and our food was excellent.   I've eaten here many times.  We ordered a small cheese crisp and I told my hubby they should get an award for that!  I had a pescado taco (a la carte) and a side of grilled veggies.  It was amazing.  The fish was grilled perfectly.  Hubby ordered the Chicken Chimi.  Not too many places include both sour cream and guacamole anymore, but Nandos does.  So many places offer a choice, but an authentic chimichanga has both.  We had an amazing dinner and took some home for lunch tomorrow.  They never skimp on portions.  The waitress was most attentive but not hovering.  So many things on the menu are delicious and the food is always beautiful.  Love it here."}
{"text":"With so many restaurants to choose from in Chandler we very rarely visit the same one twice. However this was our third time at Nando's. The first time was during the Christmas Season rush and the place was slammed! Service was understandably slow but the food the excellent. The next time was a Sunday after church. Both the food and service was better than we could have expected. 

Yesterday we decided to get takeout, which is a completely different experience with a different set of expectations. The girl who answered the phone was polite, professional and took my order with no hassle (good so far). As a rule, we expect the food to be slightly off par due to the cooling and shifting around that happens during transport. But when we opened the containers we found the food packed so tight that not so much as a grain of rice was out of place! And the food must have been piping hot when they packed it because it was the perfect temperature when I got it home. I got the Pollo Rico and my husband got the Sonoran Enchiladas. Our son got a cheese crisp (listed as an appetizer). It was put in a pizza box. They even included the chips and salsa, which we didn't eat until the next day because our dinners filled us up so much. All in all it was one of the best takeout experiences we ever had!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has as many stars as it does. Your palate has to be awful to nonexistent if you think the food here is superb. First of all, the hostess was plain weird. She may have been drinking since it was happy hour. Second, too much crap on the table. Too many plates, too many bowls, too many carafes of salsa, too many cups. Oh and the salsa and/or hot sauce is tomato paste. The chips are okay, not the yummiest. The Cabo Maragarita is cool to look at but it tastes mediocre. I had a border chimichanga (bean) and it was ok. Honestly. You have to be kidding me if you think this is good Mexican food. I'll just call this place McNando's because it's so Americanized and bland. Might I suggest an awesome place? Go to Los Dos Molinos. Leave Nando's to the senior citizens because this is far from authentic."}
{"text":"Great food. Good tequila list!"}
{"text":"The food was wonderful for all 6 of us-the order correct-beautiful waitress named Olivia...Good job!!!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for my husband's birthday dinner. The food was great, the service was attentive, and the atmosphere was nice. This will definitely be our new go to mexican place!"}
{"text":"I have visited this place several times. They have great happy hour prices and their regular menu prices are very reasonable too. Their entrees are big enough to share, my favorite is their fish tacos. They tend to get pretty busy on Friday nights, so there is sometimes a bit of a wait. Overall, thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Table was dirty floor was worse. Dinner arrived with no utensils - attention to the basic details of restaurant management seem to be missing based upon our experience & previous reviews! Sorry we can't be more positive."}
{"text":"Pros: The beer is cold.

Cons: Where to start? I find myself at an impasse to find a word both graphic and horrible enough to describe the debauchery of what they call food. My Red Chille burrito consisted of store bought cubes of over cooked meat and gristle. The red Chille sauce more closely resembled a melted red crayon and water. Did I mention the flavor? Yeah, there was none. I moved on to the stuccoesque refried beans and 3 day old rice that accompanied this experiment in culinary mediocrity. It had the flavor profile of an old hat. 

Save yourself and your palate and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I live down the street from Nandos so this is usually my choice for mexican food. I've always had great service until last night. I think our waitress was new because she had no clue what she was doing. She rushed through our order and didn't mention some key things about our food. When asking for a recommendation, she hadn't tried anything on the menu so I had no clue what to order. I recommend not going in a group larger than 4 because we were in the very back of the restaurant next to the kitchen so it was very noisy. I tried catching our waitress a couple times and she would walk right by so instead I asked a waiter walking by our table. I asked him about how big a kids quesadilla was and his response was \"sorry, you have to ask your waiter\" in a very rude tone. I was appalled by his willingness to talk to a paying costumer like that. I have always loved this place but i'm not quite sure how I feel now."}
{"text":"After seeing that Tia Rosa didn't go thru, I thought it would be another empty space at the Pecos Village....
Then came Nando's.... I just had to check it out.

As we were ushered to our table, a cute girl came and introduced herself as the waitress. As she was taking our orders, a plate of chips and salsa came. Wow! It seemed so choreographed. Our orders came in about the right time. Not too soon, not too long. And they were huge portions! They tasted good too. We are light eaters, so we had to bag the rest. While waiting for our check, the owner/manager came over and briefly chatted with us - asking about the food and service. He was glad we liked it and had some left to bring home. 

I would definitely come back for the food (need to try the other entrees), service and the convenience (close to home)."}
{"text":"Not authentic Mexican food, but it'll do. Decent portions, but overpriced. The atmosphere was new and fun, and service was good."}
{"text":"Good food good value and I liked the guitar player outside the last time we were here."}
{"text":"Through the years, my family has bounced around between Macayos, Garcia's and Serrano's but once we tried Nando's, we've rarely gone anywhere else. I must admit I've only tried a few things on the menu but the machaca w/ Egg burrito, green chili style, is the best I've had anywhere.  And now, it's the only thing I order. It's big enough to have lunch the next day.  We celebrate birthdays and anniversaries here now and have had as many as 15-18 people.  Never a bad meal, great service, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Four ladies standing at the host stand not one of them said hi until I did. Then the host told us to pick a table. What's the point of having a host if you seat yourself? Waitress was friendly but you could tell she didn't want to there. Hostess texting on her cell phone. Food was good but I was not impressed with the customer service."}
{"text":"Had a quick meeting here, happened to be a Friday night of course and it was busy.  There was a wait so we bellied up the the bar and grabbed a margarita! Bartender makes a good margarita! We waited only 15 min for our table ! Ordered the Del Mar enchiladas, they were packed with seafood and smothered in sauce exactly what I expected! Definitely order that again! Staff was friendly and management was as well a lady came over and chatted with her told her I much we all loved the food and we had a newbie in our mist so we brought him to try it! ***** my one complaint would be our waiter wouldn't bus our table of any of the cups : ( at one point we had like 12 glasses on our table. He bussed our plates and stuff but he never took a glass and we kept ordering drinks! We will be back because we love the food but just was a little unappealing look to have our table covered with cups ! We were drinking but not that fast lol ?"}
{"text":"We really like this place! Great for families and big groups. Every margarita I've tried has be perfect. Their chips and salsa remind me of Mexico. We haven't had anything there yet that we didn't love. It's as good as what I grew up on in San Diego."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials, I've tried about 8 different things over the last year.  Only thing I didn't really like was the nachos.  I think it was just too overwhelming.  Portions are big, I usually get a to go box for part of my combo.  The fajita pasta and pollo rico are delicious!  I can't ever remember waiting to be seated though they are usually busy.  Service is hit and miss, never poor but occasionally lacking energy.  For most of my life I lived in CA, NM and AZ, the flavors lean towards the NM  style.  The green chile pork is done very well.  Chicken for the tacos/enchiladas seems to be stewed and is bland but that's why they give you salsa so that you can spice it to your taste.  I will continue to go and have no issues introducing it to friends."}
{"text":"Our go to neighborhood Mexican food cafe. It's not spicy hot but it is  consistently good. Always great service from Josh the bartender and a very nice patio.  We love this place and the ambience.  My wife and I consider ourselves regulars."}
{"text":"The food is good and the prices are decent. Free chips and salsa. The salsa has good flavor, but no heat if you like it hot. The tacos are very good, and so are the beans and rice."}
{"text":"Enjoy authentic Mexican cuisine in a an upbeat friendly atmosphere. 
The food tastes great and the prices are laughable. The staff treats you like family, making suggestions and offering you their favorite choices.
The tequila choices are plenty and the margaritas are made just the way you'd like it! Zane at the Bar will shake it and mix it up just the way you want. Excellent draft selections as well. 
\"It is what it is, but a cold beer Always makes it easier\".
Outdoor patio seating available as well. 
Great experiences to be had @nandos chandler! Family owned and operated. Thank you Zane. We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"The food isn't the best, but pretty standard for a mexican restaurant. 

The place is great for families, which I like. They got us a table right away, and our waitress was great and fast despite the fact they seemed to have been completely understaffed the night we ate there."}
{"text":"My husband and decided to come here after work. I had been a couple of times previous and never had the best experience. I would say it has been a good 9 months since our last trip. 

We came in tonight and was sat right away. The server Brian P was very kind and nice. We order sodas (don't drink alcohol very often) he didn't question it or try to push anything on us haha ! 

He got our order perfect even though we are both picky eattiers. He even filled both our sodas up when we hit half way without asking!!

Brian P totally changed my opinion about this place. So much so I deleted my one star review from 9 months ago. I strongly suggest management have him train the staff or give him employee of the month. I can't wait to tell all my friends about my experience all thanks to Brian P."}
{"text":"I was given a gift card, and decided to try this place out.  It was packed, so I put my name in. A 15minute wait is what I was told. We sat right behind the hostess station. A half hour went by  so I asked if they called my name. The hostess said we texted ,and called your phone.I looked on my phone It didn't show either on my phone.  We finally were seated. 
The server was pleasant. Looked over the menu I thought it was kind of pricey.  The food was ok. My son is a picky eater so he chose his favorite a hamburger medium well. It was pink all the way through. He ate it ,but didn't really taste right.  It was an ok experience. The food was just average."}
{"text":"These restaurants have always been a family favorite. Margaritas are really good enchiladas are my favorite the only thing keeping it from five stars at this house has got a little weak over the years but it still good."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on the way back to LA on a road trip per the recommendation of a friend and I could not be more satisfied. The servers are friendly, funny, and attentive. The food was unique and delicious. We ordered the cheese crisp with green chiles and it was better than any cheese crisp we had in Tucson. For my entree I ordered the mexican shrimp pasta which was absolutely delicious and spicy. Washed down the food with delicious locally brewed hop knot IPA which was freshly on tap. The patio was awesome because we could have our dogs there and Brian, our server, even gave them each a bowl of water. The manager Blake personally came out to check on us and was very friendly. I will definitely come back on my next trip to AZ and recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"Loved the cheese enchilada . Chips and salsa are yummy especially the spicier one . It is not really hotter just more spice . Maybe oregano ? Nice decor
Lunch specials are huge and even good on weekends 
Clean 
Will go back"}
{"text":"Hello Yelp!  It's been a while.  In this economy who can really afford to eat out?  With that being said I allow myself a treat once in a while.  Tia Rosa came and went quickly in this space.  I was so happy to see that Nando's was taking it over!  I had been to Nando's in Gilbert and loved it.  They did a wonderful job remodeling and adding a beautiful patio to the space.  There are big screen TVs great for watching sports in the bar and on the patio.  It has a cozy feel that Tia Rosa did not have.  Now for the food. I've been here a few times and each time they did not disappoint.  The Chips and Salsa are delicious.  Hot, fresh chips and tasty salsa.  I've had the Chicken Chimichanga and the Pollo Rico.  The chicken is moist and tender and both entrees did not skimp!  Rice and beans are good.  The rice is fluffy and moist.  The beans are a tad bland but then it's beans so what are you gonna do?  They have killer margaritas in many different version for every taste and a giant tequila list.  Nando's is in my top 2 for mexican.  If you have not tried it.....what are you waiting for??  Go....now....there is a margarita calling your name!"}
{"text":"I've been to Macayo's....meh.  I like Ajo Al's better but service was a little spotty the last time I was there.  I have been looking for a go to Mexican place since I moved here over a year ago.  I found it!!! 
I love the atmosphere here.  It feels cozy and warm.  The service is the same way....warm and friendly.  Everyone was welcoming and accomadating.  

The chips were fresh and warm.  The salsa was nothing spectacular but it had a nice flavor.  My daughter was not feeling like mexican food so she had chicken fingers and fries and gave them a big thumbs up.  I had chicken fajitas.  They were tender and flavorful.  It was a good ratio of chicken and veggies too.  The fajitas were sizzling when served along with a second plate full of rice, beans and sides of sour cream, guac, and pico de gallo.  It was all great!  The beans had a nice layer of cheese on them and the rice was fluffy, although a tad bland.  Honestly I have not had fajitas like this in years!  They were awesome. My only complaint would be the tortillas.  They came wrapped in foil and they were a bit crispy on the edges....flour tortillas should be soft all around.  At $14 you get more than your moneys worth in my opinion.  I took over half my meal home because the portions are so generous.  

For you margarita lovers, they have a great selection of tequila and you can make your one with your favorite tequila.  The house margarita I had was a perfect compliment to the fajitas.  

Oh, and the fried ice cream.....omg!!  It was delish!!!  My daughter didn't want to share any but I got my spoon in there a few times.  

Now I find myself craving Nando's.  I will be back very soon!!!  Thank you Nando's!"}
{"text":"The food was good a couple of tips for the servers when you bring drinks to a table don't hold them by the rim of the glasses were people are drinking from. Also a tip to the management about lost my he dinner when we walked outside the door and get an extremely heavy smell of sewer gas from your plugged up manholes you need to get them serviced"}
{"text":"Check that, the snowbirds found it. Now can't barely get in during snowbird season   , bummer :-("}
{"text":"The food is average on a good day, I would of given a 3 star but EVERY time we go, all the dishes are filthy.  Dried food on the silverware, glasses & plates, last time the water tasted heavy of soap (at least they are using soap I guess).  I finally gave up & tried their new location in Mesa, same problem but not to the same extent.  Must be something in the management; they can't train or hire decent dish washers."}
{"text":"Great margaritas. Very friendly service. However. Near room temperature shredded beef taco. . Almost cold shredded beef. . My bean tostada was soggy. . Salsa and chips here are always great. My cheese enchilada was super tasty.  Cmon Nando's. You can be wayyyyyy better!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here regularly since this location opened about 6 years ago.
I love the green chili pork. The pork is very tender, the sauce is flavorful and spicy.  The barrio tacos are also really good. There is a good selection of beers on tap; so happy that they have local craft brewers featured.
The service is always great. The bar area has enough tables to see the sports action on any of three TV's. In nicer weather, the patio is a great place to relax and enjoy dinner."}
{"text":"I have given this place 3 tries and I have been let down every time.  The place looks amazing but the food is terrible.  They try to cover it up by covering EVERYTHING in a thick layer of cheese.  The wait staff is super rude and seems like they know the food is a joke.  The hostess acted like a 12 year old, oh wait maybe she was.  The only good thing about the place is their Margs."}
{"text":"Food was amazing service was great best thing about this place is that the people here know your name what is a big plus cause this place is packed with repeat regulars !! The food was not over loaded with grease or chili Thank you to our server Israel for making  my first trip here the best I will be back an I'm bringing friends to try out your bar !!!! ;)"}
{"text":"Good basic Mexican food. Ordered off the lunch menu.  I got the chicken chimichanga and it was a huge portion! Chicken was a bit dry but overall was good.  Kids had stuffed quesadilla and shredded beef taco w rice and beans. 

Service is polite and food can out relatively fast.  Next time I will split a meal bc the portions are very large."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place as it was reccommended to me by a friend, but after giving it two shots, I probably will not be returning.  No complaints about service and it is a cute restaurant, but the food quality is poor.  Pollo rico is dry, chips are just meh, salsa is bland and it seems that everything is covered in so much cheese that you can't taste the food underneath.  With the amount of Mexican restaurants available in the area, do yourself a favor and skip this one."}
{"text":"The line took forever which i don't mind figuring my first time there it would be great food.....low and behold the salsa taste like heinz ketchup...my sonoran chicken sandwich was dry and it took forever. The only positive thing I will say about this place is that they did have good service...very friendly....My first toime there will be my last!!!"}
{"text":"First I should let everyone one know to check your bank account after eating there they like too give themselves 20% tips even if you had a horrible waitress!!! They have done it to me twice now! I'm not sure if they know this but that is against the law!!!! I'm waiting for them to open today and they will be returning my money to my card ASAP! And this time I'm reporting this to the police! We had horrible service and it's my right to leave a small tip for bad service if I want!!! Remember check your bank accounts!!!! Never will I eat here with my family again!!!!!"}
{"text":"THE NANDOS ON MCDOWELL IS 10X BETTER!!!!

I love the food, truly do, but the service at this location is most certainly 5 points under where it should be. We were taking our friends to dinner to share with them some very important news on a Saturday. We arrived at 6:30 and checked in for a party of 6, was told it'd be a 25 minute wait. At 7:00 I decided to check and see how much longer and was told that my party was already seated. I informed the little hostess that we were not, we were all outside, and she blankly stared at me in disbelief. I asked how much longer and she said probably another 25 minutes. They had my name written down along with what shirt I was wearing and I at no point saw another women with a blue striped tank top arrive with a party of 6 so I demanded to see the manager. Instead of getting the manager she went and got the bartender, who was by no means apologetic for their obvious mistake. Nothing was done or suggested to try and make up for their error and we were left going across the street to Chipotle. I will NEVER be returning to the Gilbert Nando's again."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place based on what my friends have told me and what I read on Yelp.  I decided to take the family out to dinner this past Saturday.  We arrived around 5:30PM thinking it would not be that busy and that we would have a short wait, boy was I wrong.  The place was packed and we were told there was a 40-45 minute wait and due to the excitement of wanting to try this place we waited and waited and waited some more.  After 60 minutes of waiting we were finally seated and our waiter was very friendly and took care of our needs.  The food was a small step above Serrano's with the salsa being a little bland for my taste.

I did a little research after eating here and would recommend calling ahead to get your name on the waiting list no matter what time you plan on visiting and ask your waiter for the hotter hot sauce if you don't find the salsa they bring to the table hot enough.

I will probably give this place another shot down the road."}
{"text":"I ordered a mini combo platter which had miniature tacos, bean tostadas, chicken and beef chimichangas, flautas, pollo rico, and rice beans.  I liked that everything was miniature and that it allowed me to try a bunch of menu items.  There was only one item I would try again on the main menu- the pollo rico.  As the menu states, it is \"everyone's favorite.\"  It is a chicken burrito topped with jalapeño cream cheese and cheddar cheese (sauce).  The chicken is not very flavorful (no seasoning), but the cheese mixture is so delicious it covers the lack of flavor in the chicken. The other combo items (minus the rice and beans) were served soggy. The one item, the pollo rico, saved my meal."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Love the Chicken sandwich and Chile relleno. Salsa and chips are also very good. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The food here is so good. The wife and I were passing through and decided to give this place a shot. The lunch menu is amazingly cheap and the plates are actually dinner sizes, which many restaurants don't do. The pollo Rico was so good, I definitely am going to come back for it."}
{"text":"Food was good service was good. The fajitas chicken portion was huge on meat. The beans were ok a little over cooked. With the flour tortillas I only received two. The service here was great though."}
{"text":"This our favorite family restaurant and the food, staff are friendly and great. This time Trevor was our waiter he was awesome, he definitely took care of us and thats what keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"Update 6/30/2011 - Ate there again with my daughter and mom. Unfortunately it was still so so, just not a lot of flavor, atmosphere was still okay and I like the selection of plants in the landscaping around the building. Seems like a nice dress up and go out with special out of town guests place - but the food continues to underwhelm. 

------ 

Nando's. I've eaten here three times now and I guess I'm ready to review. 

Atmosphere - gets my top rating. This busy and popular restaurant is fun. The lighting is subdued. The Spanish decor and architecture is attractive. The seating options are plentiful. The service is very good. The tables are kept full with water glasses, pitchers of ice water, and a generous basket of chips and two kinds of salsa. 

Food - mediocre. I hate to say it. I want the food to match the atmosphere but after three times it does not. My daughter likes the grilled cheese on the kid's menu but I've tried three different things - a chimichanga, a chicken enchilada and some kind of taco salad. All three were only okay. Last night I had the enchilada and despite the lake of melted cheese and red sauce, I found it rather bland and tasteless. The enchilada I had last month was similarly lacking in zest. The salsa that comes with the chips is only okay. I did enjoy my Margarita. 

The atmosphere is so appealing I may brave the mediocre food for yet another return visit but I will keep looking for a truly memorable Mexican food experience in the Mesa/Gilbert area."}
{"text":"Well...we needed a place to have late lunch/early dinner (3 generations). Close by was Nandos. You enter the restaurant and it's very pretty, and clean. The hostess asked us (about 50 times..ok, maybe only 5, but it felt like 50) if we wanted to sit near the bar because it was happy hour, or if we'd like a booth in the general restaurant. We opted for the general restaurant. As we sat down at the table, we noticed how much stuff was all over the table..honestly we couldn't even open the menus until we rearranged and put some stuff out of the way. The chips and salsa came very fast. Now I say salsa but it was actually hot sauce. I say hot sauce, but it wasn't hot at all. Hot if you're from Minnesota maybe, but it was not good. There were apparently 2 different kinds but you couldn't prove it by me. We ordered drinks. I ordered a habanero infused margarita (gee, maybe I'll get some heat from that). Let me say our waiter was very nice.The margarita gets a 6/10 limes from me. It was interesting, and did have a little bite to it. All of a sudden we had this weird fish smell that wafted our way from the table behind us. Oooo weee, it was fishy..not something we expected at a mexican restaurant. It was an uncomfortable fishy smell, and that's all I'm saying. 

Our food didn't take too long to come..about 15 minutes. I ordered the seafood relleno. Now, I love my rellenos. This was not good. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good. It came with beans and rice, and they were cooked very well, and had great taste. The relleno had shrimp that was rubbery. The sauce and cheese on it was good. The number 3 that one of us ordered was reported to be very good, and the border chimichanga was \"alright\". 

The company was great. The waiter was friendly, attentive, and not a pest. The food and drinks were....ok.

My suggestions-hostess person, don't attack people when they first come in. There is a fine line between friendly and creepy. 

Salsa- make some real salsa, or at least have your tomato tasting hot sauce have some heat."}
{"text":"This is a place in our neighborhood that we really don't go to very often. A lot of that has to do with the crazy popularity - wait times are consistently over an hour for dinner on the weekends.

As far as the food, the chips and salsa are good (maybe not \"great,\" but I like mine on the spicier side and usually stick with the default here because of the rest of my family). We have found their chicken to be a little bland, and we prefer their flour to the corn tortillas -- usually I like corn better. 

This place creates an odd situation for me, since I normally walk through the menu at a place to see what is good. Here, I have pretty much stuck to one thing on the menu: Alfredo's Green Chile Pork, \"A plate of tender pork simmered in a spicy Hatch green chile sauce. Topped with Monterey Jack cheese and served with rice, beans and flour tortillas.\" It is quite a bit of food.

So, while I can't review the other dishes, this one has been consistently good. We have not had problems with the service, although the waiting area is a little small for the crowds that show up during the busy times and it can take a bit to get seated. The bar has open seating at the high-top tables, so you can do that if there are just a few of you.

It has what appears to be a very popular bar, especially for happy hour. There is quite a bit of parking, although the spots right in front of the entrance fill up quickly.

UPDATE: March 2018
My kids like this place and it is nearby, so I have been several more times since I wrote my initial review -- enough that I'm the Yelp \"mayor\" of the place now. Like I noted in my earlier review, our service is always good. Since my original review, though, the food has improved and I have been making my way through the menu once again. The Sonoran Enchiladas are tasty and I had some of the huevos con chorizo that my son ordered last time, which was also good. There is also a chicken burrito or chimi that has jalapeño cream cheese, which is pretty rich and I think is great if you cut the richness with some of their spicy salsa.

Based on these recent experiences, I have raised my rating to 4 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch/brunch here recently.  Beautiful room, great wait staff...especially Tina, who was tirelessly cheerful, efficient, and helpful.  Huevos Rancheros were excellent.  So were the Chorizo and eggs.  Chips were hot and crisp.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican joint.

Margaritas are good and decently sized. I had the Chicken Chimi which was very good. They did mess up the order (added sour cream when I requested none) and offered to replace it, however at that point I didn't want to wait for them to remake it as the rest of the table's food had arrived.

Not my first choice for Mexican in Chandler but would go again given it's convenient location to my apartment."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant.  Hubby ordered the steak fajitas (very tender) and I had the mahi mahi tacos.  YUM!  The mango margarita is seriously good too.  So glad to have another great option in E. Mesa!!"}
{"text":"I went to Nando's hoping to find a really good Mexican food joint that reminds me of the Mexican food in Texas; not Sonoran style.  The location is pretty good, plenty of parking in and about the shopping center.  The ambiance of the restaurant is family friendly; maybe a bit too much as this place was really LOUD including crying babies.  That was almost enough to make me turn and RUN.  I for one do not like to pay for a meal and cannot converse in a normal tone...who wants to YELL at their dinner companion and pay for the privilege of YELLING.  However really wanting to find that good Mexican food joint, I stayed put.   

First let me tell you they provide really tasty chips and salsa, as well as a pitcher of ice water. I ordered their Chicken Chimichanga which was a HUGE portion.  The overall flavor was OK, refried beans had a bit too much melted cheese on top, the chicken was grilled and tasty, however way to many white onions throughout...some bites were onions only!

So, did I find my really good Mexican food joint?  I'm not sure as of this posting so I will give it another try or two; sure hope the LOUD atmosphere is not the norm and the food reminds me of home in Texas.

Three and Half stars for LOUD atmosphere..."}
{"text":"I am always amazed at the quality of the employees here that make the dining experience 5 star.  Who ever is in charge of hiring employees here is A+++ or they are just fantastic at  training employees..

The employees are the first impression however the food is always consistent and fantastic here.  The food is always fresh, hot and fabulous even if you come at an off time.
 
I love the green chili here, the beans and rice and the chips and salsa are fantastic and I'm grateful that Nando;s chose this location to provide East Mesa with the upscale Mexican food that we have been hoping for.  I happen to love the green chili here however, there are so many choices and they are all fabulous!  This is the only place that my family can go to that we all agree is amazing no matter what you order."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Try the pollo Ricco."}
{"text":"Halfway decent Mexican food but its close to the house. Last experience here the wait staff forgot about us even before the drink order. Our group sat for 20 min before we had water. Then when our food was brought out they ran away only for us to discover nobody had silverware. Likely will be my last visit."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around! Awesome service, every time we go we have an amazing experience. Best con queso dip, hands down, served with baked chips that are amazing. Kids love it as much as we do. Hardest part is trying a new item when we're so addicted to the first ones we tried."}
{"text":"This place is a good Mexican place. Service is typically good, the servings are large (pollo Rico is bomb). My only complaint is they put a lot stuff on the table before you even get your food. I don't like a cluttered table do it annoys me a bit."}
{"text":"Went for lunch after reading the reviews on here.  I wasn't as amazed as most people I guess but the food was pretty good.  I started out with a Montana Margarita which was a margarita with huckleberries in it and huckleberry flavoring.  It was very good and very strong which I was happy about.  The chips and salsa came and the hot salsa was pretty good.  I ordered the crab and shrimp enchiladas and people weren't kidding about the portion size.  I barely got 2/3's of it down before I felt my stomach stretching in pain.  I was very happy that the rice and beans were actually edible not just there for taking up space.  Most places I have been to lately the rice and beans were just not edible.  The location was very nice and clean inside and had a tv with football on in the bar area.  The outdoor seating area looked very nice and the menu was full of stuff I wanted to come back for.  Especially the banana nut flan."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and hang out! The salsa is amazing! The staff is friendly! You can eat inside or outside. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Ive had dinner here several times and its mediocre Mexican at best.  The beans taste like they come out of a can.  I do like their chips, light and crispy and the salsa is ok.  I would probably give this place 3 stars if it was just based on the dinner restaurant.  Today we decided to try out their breakfast for the first time.  I was impressed walking into the breakfast cafe, as I didnt expect it to be its own little restaurant.  We stood next to another family that had already been waiting.  We stood there for more than 5 minutes and none of the 4 employees we saw would acknowledge us.  They kept glancing our way and continuing what they were doing.  I asked the family who had been waiting longer than us if anyone had helped them and they said no!  So I went up to the bar and still everyone was too busy to talk to me.  Finally I was able to ask someone if we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated.  They said to seat ourselves.  So we ended up letting the other family take the only available clean table and we continued to stand there with no greeting or acknowledgement from any of the staff.  Dirty tables everywhere that needed to be cleaned.  We walked out. What kind of customer service is that?  We stood there for a very long time!  I was excited to try out the breakfast here but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Sadly, our experience with Nando's has been nothing but disappointing. I say sadly because it's located to our old home and we would frequently order-in food from he neighborhood restaurants. I adore Tex-Mex/Mexican food and was hoping for a reliable spot to grab a simple meal of flautas or enchiladas every now. This ended up not happening and I'm sad about this because who wants not-so-great food within a stone's throw from one's house?

We first ordered from the restaurant when it first opened years ago. My husband went to go pick up our order and not only had they forgotten a dish and our appetizer of guacamole and chips. 

The food was lackluster and strangely bland. I didn't understand how a restaurant could serve tortilla chips that resembled the consistency and taste of cardboard (yes, I had a regrettable bite of cardboard as a toddler) and cheese that was bland. Seriously, how can you mess this up and on a grand scale? How did this restaurant ever franchise? 

We pointed out the missed dish and guacamole to the hostess and they generously gifted us a $15 gift card for our trouble. It was a gracious offer and one we appreciated. 

The second experience we had was only a month ago when we took friends out for dinner. Their choice was Nando's and I truly wish we hadn't gone. We ordered guacamole to share with the whole table and I was highly disappointed. It almost tasted as if there was soggy and shredded lettuce in the guacamole. It was flavorless and served with yet again the blandest tortilla chips I have had in my mouth. 

Then came our main dishes - I chose the chicken tacos with rice and beans on the side. It was horrifically, comically bad. The chicken was cold and the tortilla was rubbery. The rice and beans also lacked salt and overall flavor. 

It also took us ten minutes to get our server's attention to pay. Even after we stood up and walked toward the front door, we didn't catch our server's attention. We asked the hostess if we could get out bill and it took yet another five minutes to get our bill. My husband, our of frustration, just handed the server his card because we were so tired of waiting to pay. 

Overall, this place is in a great location and the shopping center is nice and full of delicious other spots. But, Nando's is not worth your time or money or energy. Save your calories for something else delicious."}
{"text":"This is one of those cases were maybe my expectations were too high based on a recommendation from a friend. I had the fish tacos and the fish was not tasty and very dry. The tortilla was almost soggy. My wife had the chicken fajitas and deed not fair much better. It just wasn't high quality. While the staff was friendly, they could have been a little more attentive and definitely faster. Overall, I was disappointed but again it might of been because I came expecting great and just got okay."}
{"text":"We had a group of 10 and were seated at a very large table that easily accommodated all of us.  The service was great with prompt beverage service and water.  The menu which is mostly Mexican is large and should satisfy just about everyone.  We did not have appetizers but everyone ordered an entree.  The food service was fast with the food being hot and tasty.  I ordered the #1, two over stuffed tacos with beans and rice, which were delicious.  Everyone enjoyed their entrees with almost everyone taking leftovers home.  The restaurant decor was pleasant, clean and seemed much larger inside.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say true mexican flavor,  but close. Great taste and great service. Worth checking out if your in the area."}
{"text":"The best chile con queso outside of Texas! I always get the Border Chimichanga with black beans. 

The staff is pretty knowledgeable about what is and isn't vegetarian, some more than others. For my boyfriend's birthday, we went with a large group (meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans), and the manager was able to tell us what was and wasn't cooked in lard, what was and wasn't vegan, and basically, how everything was made (aside from the chips, which are sent to them bagged). 

Some of the best Mexican food I had was while I was in Austin, TX, and when my friends from ATX came here, I took them to Nando's and they LOVED it. They said it was some of the best queso they'd ever eaten, and I think that is a great feat. 

My boyfriend and I go here often. Even though it is out of our normal few miles of regular dining, we make an exception for their huge portions and delicious food! it's a little pricy, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"They are awesome! Automatically bring out chips, salsa, hot salsa, and waters. Service is great and the food is amazing as well. Very reasonably priced, too! My husband and I went for lunch on a weekday. We had one bowl of chips, got two taco salads, one fountain drink, and one water. It was $20 even and we left full without even finishing our food."}
{"text":"I was in heaven here and had a great time with my friends for lunch.  The prices weren't bad and the food was so good I didn't want to stop eating, of course I had to or I was going to explode.    I have to go back and try some other menu items.  Great for a large group on a Saturday afternoon!"}
{"text":"Gotta say that the portions are huge! Had the steak and pork fajitas, pork was better, steak was pretty dry.  The wife had tacos al carbon, she loves it. We couldve shared one and had leftovers! Great place and ambiance, great service. The habanero hot salsa was very good.  We will be adding Nandos to our rotation. :-)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've NEVER given a terrible review.  Generally we like most places and find something to enjoy about our visit.  I have had lunch with some girls from work at Nandos and enjoyed it, so we decided to give it a try for dinner since my son was in the mood for shredded beef tacos.  We visited Nando's on a Friday evening with my husband and two kids, and came away feeling like I just threw away $75.  My daughters kids' cheeseburger was a thin, rock hard, pre-frozen patty, that looked as bad as it tasted, she barely ate three bites...and trust me, she's an eater.  My son got the shredded beef tacos and he enjoyed them!  Nothing negative to say.  I ordered a skinny margarita and being it was Friday night, I took a huge swig, and about spit it out.  It tasted like straight lime juice with a shot of tequila in it, either that or the skinny mix was rotten...it was that terrible and bitter.  I asked my husband to try it to see if I was nuts, and he reacted the same way.  I've honestly never had a \"bad\" margarita, until I had their margarita.  I ordered the street tacos and the beef looked and tasted like frozen beef strips that you'd get from Taco Bell...like the beef was pieced together and wasn't real beef.  My husband ordered a seafood enchilada that was all cream sauce and zero seafood...literally zero.  He ordered a Hornitas margarita with a floater of Chambord and got a blended margarita with raspberry sauce put in it...when he asked where his floater of Chambord was, our server told us the bar said \"they didn't have 'floaters'\".  Ummm...what?  My son was the only one who ate his meal...the rest of us ate less than 1/4 of our plates.  Oh well...lesson learned.  Never visiting there, again!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I am not a big fan of waiting in lines. I have to say that this was some of the best mexican food I have ever had. It was worth the wait. Their service was great. I have lived in AZ for 20 + years and have never heard of this place, wow. I will definately be going back."}
{"text":"I love coming on the weekend for breakfast and zanes peach mimosas! Olivia is the sweetest bartender! Five stars!"}
{"text":"I went here the other day in need of some long awaited tacos. I am vegan, and I find that eating at Mexican restaurants is the best for being able to customize items on the menu to be vegan. I ordered refried-bean avocado tacos with no cheese or sour cream and a side of rice. The waitress was very friendly (usually people aren't when you have a complicated order). A few minutes later the manager came over to inform me that their refried beans were made with lard and asked if I would rather have black beans. She could tell my order was vegan and she said that she was too and wanted to make sure it came out perfect! She was very friendly and I was pleasantly surprised, I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm, love their jalapeño dip!!
This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. Come here often while visiting my dad in the area."}
{"text":"Visited Nandos with some friends (who go there regularly) and was impressed.

The decor is typical, nothing outstanding, but nice.

The food was very good and served in good sized quantities.  I had a carnitas enchilada and sides.  It was very good.  Others at our table had burros, enchiladas and a salad.  The food tasted fresh and good."}
{"text":"Sorry Nandos hideaway but the food was not great at all. No flavor , pricey , not even eye appealing. The only tasty thing was the Ranchero sauce."}
{"text":"Went to Nando's in Mesa with family that raved about the food but the salsa tasted like ketchup mixed with Pace picante and fake chips  the street tacos had no flavor   I ordered a flauta and it came with one fat flauta made with a corn tortilla instead of flour.  The service on the other hand deserved 5 stars and they were tipped accordingly and we had 8 people   We didnt say wow to the food but service was great!"}
{"text":"Bland standard Mexican food at too high of a price. The chips and salsa were completely bland....I had two chips, when at Mexican restaurants I normally devour an entire basket and convince myself not to let them bring me another. I ordered the margarita special which was made with Blue Curacao and an upside-down Coronita....not very good. On top of it, the glass was so big and heavy that I literally had to push it around the table with both hands. I ordered two enchiladas, one with ground beef, the other with shredded, which were ok. I was shocked that the lunch bill, plus tip was over $70 for 2 meals, one margarita, one beer, and 2 shots of Patron."}
{"text":"I love the environment of Nando's but unfortunately the food fell a little short for me. I got the spinach enchiladas and they were pretty bland. I know it is hard to season to cater to a lot of people's likes, so that is probably why, but I was expecting more. I am someone who prefers spicy food though so if you don't, you might enjoy it. Overall, if you are a genuine Mexican food lover, i think you are probably better off at a hole in the wall place where you can get the same thing, only better and for half of the price."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our lunch today. We ordered from the lunch menu so not sure if the portions were smaller than the dinners but they were certainly enough food for us! I had the shredded beef enchiladas and the hubby had the chicken tacos. He especially appreciated the beans with melty cheese."}
{"text":"I guess I'm not ordering the \"right\" things because this place, to me, is good but not great.

I have been here probably 4 times, every time the service was very good.  No complaints on service.  The salsa is good, beans and rice are \"ok\" but not great.  I've had the fajitas twice, a burro enchilada style, and a taco plate.  Everything was just \"ok\".  Nothing stood out to me as \"damn that's good\".

Yeah the building looks nice, interior is well done.  Bar is nice, margaritas are good (when are they not?).  Whatever, just another Mexican place in the Valley."}
{"text":"If anyone tries to make me eat here again, I will wrestle them to the ground.  I ordered chicken enchiladas with verde sauce.  I received some chicken that was reasonably flavorful (and not overcooked) but completely encased in a ton of bright orange \"cheese\" and smothered in a sauce that was a beige/tan color and amazingly salty.  There was nothing \"verde\" about it.  The rice and beans tasted as if they were boiled in a high sodium chicken stock.  Blech.  Margaritas were fine.  Service lackluster.  I no recommendo."}
{"text":"To start off the food was great! Our service was not the top notch service i would have hoped for for my wifes graduation dinner but before we left Mike, the owner, made sure to earn our business back. 

See you again, and thanks again Mike!"}
{"text":"An improvement over my last mexican meal here in Arizona, but just pretty average.  The chicken burrito was ALL chicken inside, not spiced or seasoned, just cooked chicken.  A bit dry as well.  The green chile sauce over the top was outstanding and the moist tortilla made up for the insides sort of sucking wind.  Tacos were a weird deep fried flour tortilla.  Not so good.  The tostada shell was soggy.

Good service and nice decor, but just OK food."}
{"text":"The food is always hot, fresh & yummy. Big portions. We LOVE the chips and salsa. Atmosphere is great and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Must be the new management. Because the customer service at this place has dwindled. I placed an order to go. Sat at the bar for 20 mins waiting on my large order. I would have bought two margarita's if anyone, bartender, waitress or anyone would have asked me. The bartender waited on everyone but me. The food was excellent , although my ammenties were forgotten (rice and beans).  I will start going back to Garcia's. Their customer service and food has always been great, and their margarita's are cheaper."}
{"text":"I love this place my fav go to mexican. Service is always great. Watch for prime nights or you will be waiting awhile. Todays lunch hour was great, not busy at all.  I ordered the enchilada n taco plate.. must remind myself not to order anything but the mini platter.  I love the mini sizes. I would normally give 5 stars but today my taco wasn't up to par..was left in fryer too long cuz my meat was all fried and it left such an odd taste..usually they r always on point n delish.. so for today you loose a point. Was my birthday lunch too. I'm from San Diego..so trust me when I say if you want good mexican food in Phx..go to Nandos."}
{"text":"We love this place but today we had the worst service. Sitting on the patio apparently is the worst place to sit. Took 20mins to bring us drinks, 1hr to take our order, almost 40mins to get our food and took us 30mins to flag our server down to pay the check. To pay it!!! We could have easily walked out without paying and our server would have still been ignoring us/ not noticing we were gone. Besides that our server did not write down our orders and brought the pickiest member of our party a messed up order. On top of that tried to charge us for add ons that were clearly stated not wanted. We will go back but make sure its when the good servers are working and in the bar where you aren't forgotten."}
{"text":"We have been long time regulars of breakfast every Sunday morning.  The food is usually pretty good and the service used to be great but our experience today was so bad, we won't be back."}
{"text":"it's disappointing that a place you go to in the summer has bad service when the snow birds return.  it's hit or miss here.  consistent food, it's ok, not great.  but when we are eating at the bar and have to ask for chips, and have to ask for menus, and ask for another beer....then have him serve other people first....dont ask why you didn't get a better tip.  see you in the summer Nandos.....maybe."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, and no apologies. Wasn't that busy and lots of busboys and servers walking around. We were just forgotten, and no apologies"}
{"text":"We love Nando's! Tonight's meal was yummy and topped with the perfect amount of cheese. I typically get the #3 (a taco, cheese enchilada, and rice & beans). The flavor was on point. Our sever tonight was helpful and very courteous. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Been here three times. Service has always been great!! Food is plentiful and tasty. Be sure to watch the bus boys clean and set the tables.... amazingly fast and they look like they're having fun while they do it."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the restaurant. I didn't have really high expectations because the reviews said it was pretty casual. I was so excited when I got there. I was greeted with a friendly hello right when I walked in. We were seated at a booth, and someone brought chips and salsa right away. Our server could not have been nicer.  (kaylia???) Super friendly and smiley. She made suggestions about the menu.  We both chose fajitas.  Good choice.  I also had a daiquiri which was really good.  I did indulge on the banana flan.  Yummy, different and definitely the high point.  Chips don't seem homemade but the tortillas were really warm and fresh.  The service was really the shining point here.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to go check this one out for lunch today, it's close to our office and in a development with Oregano's, BLD, among others. WOW.  We love the atmosphere, they have alot of outdoor seating, fireplace, twinkling lights.  Very nice.We sat at the bar, shared an appetizer, service from the 2 young ones behind the bar was excellent and the food portions were massive.  Parking could get a bit tough during Happy Hour and evening given the number of other restaurants and businesses there but that wouldn't stop us from going again.  I think this will be one of our new hangouts! Fresh chips and great salsa were also a bonus!  You won't be disappointed here!"}
{"text":"Arrived on a busy Saturday night, on a double date with some friends. 
Waited about 15-20minutes, the place was buzzing! 

Ambiance was so cute, dimmed lighting with twinkle lights everywhere!! 

Chips and salsa were the best!!!!!  Ugh! Can't say it enough, I could've probably drank that stuff! 

We promptly received our drinks & ordered. 
My husband ordered a chicken chimichanga 
I ordered the flautas combo with rice & beans. 

We loved our meals, his chimichanga was stuffed and flavorful 
My flautas were stuffed with meat & topped with guac, fresh tomatoes, lettuce, cheese & sour cream
Mmmmm so much happening there I couldn't even finish the 2nd one!!! Yummmmmmm

However, our party was all in the agreement that the rice and beans were horrifying 
Beans were dried out (like they've been sitting in pan or heating lamp for hours) & the rice was bland with no flavor
The one downfall of the whole meal, a bit disappointed 

The service was wonderful and so was were the entrees, so we will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and just had an appetizer (which was great), so it was nice to come back and check out their actual meals. First off- if you're limited on time, you probably should plan accordingly. I've been there on a Thursday and Friday night, and it doesn't matter. It's just busy all the time. Because it's so busy, it's loud. Can't really hear yourselves talking, so not recommended for intimate conversation. 

But the FOOD- excellent. Had spinach enchiladas and it was top notch. It also helps that I'm a cheese-a-holic. If you like cheese you will not be disappointed. I have also never been much of a fan of Mexican rice, and I loved their rice. You get a ton of food for the prices, very worth it. Our server took great care of us when we told her we were in a bit of a rush. I will definitely eat here again, I think Nando's just replaced Serranos as our Mexican food place when all the back east friends and family come to visit.  Though I'm thinking take out, to avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a couple of times. The chips and salsa are good, but the food was bland. It had no flavor at all. We needy find another place for Mexican food in Mesa."}
{"text":"The Hatch Green Pork was delicious plain or in a burrito smothered!  The seafood relleno was great too!  You have to try the sopapillas that come as 4 cinnamon and sugar minis with honey to dip them in and top with whipped cream!  Sinful!  I tried the prickly pear margarita frozen with sugared rim, it was great!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the blandest, whitest \"Mexican\" food in the world then this is your place. Nothing has any seasoning or any heat. Service was so-so.

Overall a very disappointing experience. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Cheese Crisp in the entire valley. Perfectly crispy and delicious, I ate most of it myself. My second favorite dish is the Pollo Rico which is a delight, I love the jalapeno cream cheese.  This last time I split the steak fajitas and they were wondorous! The meat was perfectly tender and the vegetables were cooked perfectly!

I also love the chips and salsa, the hotter one is quite flavorful and doesn't just burn and the regular is really fresh!!"}
{"text":"The food was consistent with the location I usually go to but the service was not as great!  I definitely recommend the Pollo Rico and cheese crisp!!!  The chips and salsa are some of the best I've ever had and as an AZ native, I've had a lot of chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Affordable lunch menu with large portions but if you care about food quality, I wouldn't recommend it.... 

The chicken on my taco salad was way too salty and the salad overall was composed of the bagged iceberg salads you buy at the grocery store."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the patio is the only place to sit.  They play good music and when we come, it's always loud, but good loud, you know, people having a good time loud. Try their nachos, you can't go wrong.  The Pollo RICO, mmm good!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places in Chandler for Mexican food! Even if it didn't have great service food and drinks, the restaurant is beautiful! The patio is amazing, decorated with lights and wrought iron fencing. Very rustic and old world Mexico. Large pillars, tile work, stone and old wood everywhere. Great ambiance. But I do love the food! Not your typical combo #6 with beans and rice! They have fish tacos, pork verde and steak entrees. The appetizers, like the Mexican pizza, is enough for dinner! I like their nachos, piled high and loaded with fresh ingredients. I usally grab a taco plate of some kind. The carnitas are amazing! They have a great tequila selection and happy hour specials too. The bartender offered me up a sample of their habanero tequila. Which is just a blanco tequila in a large jar with habanero chilis! Ay Carumba!! Careful with this one kids! It's not meant to be  a shot! The servers are friendly but not the best or fastest I've had. The bartenders I know, Mike and Gary are very helpful and friendly. Overall nice place for good Mexican food where the chips, salsa and margaritas flow!"}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and the place is packed even on weeknights. It's pretty standard Arizona style Mexican food, but with some healthier options mixed in. Vegetarians can take note that they don't use lard in their beans. 

On a couple of occasions the service was superb and I was happy about that. I've tried the tacos, burritos, and chicken salad. None of it stood out as amazing but it wasn't bad either, just pretty standard. One time I went on a limb and ordered the spinach enchilada which I highly recommend to anyone that likes gooey cheese and spinach. It was fantastic!

The salsa they bring with your chips isn't spicy enough for my liking but it does the trick I suppose. Overall an okay place for the east valley."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch and love sharing the Ensalada Asada with a friend (it is huge). First time here with family I'm reminded that the chips and salsa are so so. Lacks the flavor you typically find in a good AZ restaurant. No worries friends it gets better from there. I ordered the seafood enchiladas. Great choice! I was not disappointed. Will definitely be back for lunch and occasionally dinner."}
{"text":"I guess I don't have too much to say since I really just ordered a bean and cheese burrito. Nothing too exciting about that! It was good but not the best I've ever had or anything.  Service was good. Prices were fair."}
{"text":"We are so excited to find good Mexican food. We really love the flavors. We've been twice now. The first time was perfect our waiter was attentive and helpful. Wth second time not so much. We went last night and end up having to ask the busser for drink refills. More than once. It may have been because we were on the patio this time but disappointing in the waitress. The food was again amazing and we will continue to refer people to this location. ENJOY."}
{"text":"We love Nandos! We always get the appetizer nachos to share and we can't even finish them! We've dined there with other couples that have ordered enchiladas, burritos, and seafood and all have said their meals were excellent. The complimentary chips and salsa are always fresh an delicious. We love the atmosphere and attentive staff - you will never run out of salsa or drinks! This location is usually pretty busy but we've never waited long for a table."}
{"text":"Really bad customer service at this location! I brought family in that never eaten at Nando's before, and on this occasion half the tables food was delicious, the other half, the food was bland, soggy, greasy and inedibly. I asked them to remake it with a few changes, and was greeted with mild hostility. Same with my sisters dish as she ordered the same as I. Anyhow, it came out same as before, with out the changes made, different type of meat, etc. I brought this to my waitress's attention and she quite literally said to me that this is what happens when your kitchen staff does not speak English and are not American!

Needless to say I explained my disgust by the comment and heavy emphasis on her bigotry, and explained that my sister and I didn't want the remade food. Especially since my entire party had finished and had been waiting on our remade food for at least 20min. So she brought the bill, and guess what... Not only was the original food we returned on it, so was the remake. Needless to say I had the manger come over and after explaining to the situation she told me that I was the only person to complain about the carne asada that day and that maybe the problem was me... After making it clear I was not going to pay for food returned and not consumed nor was it going home with me she finally took it off the bill but I had to stand my ground. My son politely told her that we were regulars and her behavior and hostility would lose the restaurant around $2k annually from our family she basically told us not to let the door hit us on the way out. We have never returned. And whenever my company selects this place to eat I resolutely refuse to patronage this restaurant, even if I am not paying the bill, therefore my coworkers choose elsewhere to go. They lost out on a lot of business because of their bad management."}
{"text":"We started at the Gilbert location when they first opened and loved it. Then we found out that the chandler location opened and since then we frequent this place opening. We have a group of us that are regulars on Wed or Thurs. evening, we will say that the food is plentiful and good (always have leftovers to take home) The chips and salsa is great, and their margarita's are fantastic. 
 I do want to comment on the service, they are all so very nice, we especially like MARK & ZANE....They are fantastic. If you go there stop by and tell them hello and you've made a friend for life, seriously they are so friendly and when you return they will remember you :) Thank you MARK & ZANE..........Tom and I will continue to restaurant  frequent this because of people like you.........See ya next Thursday :)"}
{"text":"I eat at nando's at least twice a week!! I luv it and every meal I have ever had is big enough for 2!!"}
{"text":"A big shout out to Josh, who was our server during happy hour and lunch. He was so attentive and gave us quick and quality service, and was super helpful with recommendations and tips on food items. He is a big reason we will keep coming back here! And of course the yummy food and happy hour specials don't hurt! ;)"}
{"text":"This place is loud, crowded, but they serve delicious fajitas and awesome chips and salsa.  I know people are complaining about the spice level, but my aunt asked for a hotter version and they brought it to our table.  I love my salsas mild, so I must have pounded half the basket of extra crispy and fresh tortilla chips.  Because the salsa is served in a small carafe, you must be drinking the thing before needing to ask for refills.

Their portions are massive and I tried my best, but it was a gut buster.  I love that fact that they have low carb tortillas,and they too were massive like the size of a baby's t-shirt.  I could have easily made 2 full burritos with the load of vegetables, meat and beans that came with the meal.  The leftovers were killer and just hit the spot since it had another day to marinate.  

I am grateful that I ordered what I did, but I wouldn't recommend the fish tacos, because my husband didn't seem to want to give them 4 stars.  Since I'm not heading back to AZ for a bit, I'm sticking to my guns with a solid 4 stars for the steak and chicken mix fajitas with the low carb tortillas.  Darn it, now I'm hungry after writing this review.  

The prices are more than reasonable, but if you want to have a cheaper meal, they have an pretty decent happy hour menu too."}
{"text":"I love Nandos food! They are delicious. If you like hot hot hot salsa ask them for the salsa from the back.. Ohh its hot and tasty. I've had a lot here and love all the dishes. We usually end up with the same waitress which was crazy but great because she is fast with refills and food. We usually come for dinner."}
{"text":"The salsa here at Nandos was amazing.  I usually make great judgement with the salsa, as I pour a ton of salsa all over my main entrees.  I do not do it because the food lacks flavor, but I do it because I love salsa just that much.  I ordered the Jalapeno Chicken Soup.  I wasn't terribly hungry and I banked on eating a lot of chips and salsa to fill up.  The soup was okay.  I was happy it was white meat chicken, but it lacked some flavor.  I tried some of my friend's rice and beans, and it was a little too salty for my liking.  I will have to give this another try and maybe my ratings might improve a little."}
{"text":"Great food. Good bloody Mary's. Service was eh... But the waitress realized she ignored us. Ha! No harm done. For Arizona... This place was good."}
{"text":"Not sure what the appeal is to this place. I went in with my kids and ordered fish tacos. I was given two dry, plain corn tortillas with two pieces of dry, plain, unseasoned fish. No sauce, no lettuce, pico, guac...nothing at all. I scooped my beans and rice in there and used the salsa that came with the chips to drown it all in. I left wondering wtf I paid for. Fish tacos across the street at Del Taco tasted better. I don't recall what the kids ate, but they asked to stop at Jack in the Box on the way home, so that tells you something right there. Very disappointed and will not be back. 1 star for cleanliness."}
{"text":"There are things I love, there are things I don't. I keep coming back based on pure convenience. The chicken asada ensalada is my go to, their green enchilada sauce is by far some of the best I've ever had.

However there are times when ordering especially on the phone that you may encounter an immature or child like hostess that doesn't listen and over talks patrons. Not enough to scare me away but enough to make it annoying, maybe just enough to make me question my intentions."}
{"text":"I actually ended up coming here with my family to have breakfast on my birthday a couple of months ago. We had planned to go to BLD but they don't take reservations and when we all arrived they were crazy busy with a long wait. So we went right across the parking lot and were seated immediately at Nando's. It was a beautiful day so we sat out on the patio and we all enjoyed ourselves.

I had been here before for dinner with my husband and I can't remember what we ordered but it was just ok so we never came back. I was a little more impressed with the breakfast. They had a good variety of both Mexican and traditional American items on the menu and everyone seemed pretty happy with their food. The prices were also very reasonable. My sisters kids were able to get pancakes that were on the menu as side dishes for just a few bucks and they were pretty happy."}
{"text":"Went there tonight and ordered takeout order. After waiting over forty minutes I finally got my food. I live about five minutes away. When I got home my food was ice cold. After reheating the food the food was good but there service is beyond terrible. Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"I ordered the burro with the green sauce.. wasnt too fond of it, it was sweet. My boys however, got the chorizo con huevo and they really liked it.. rice and beans were good."}
{"text":"As a rule I don't go to sit down Mexican restaurants as there are too many good mom and pop places to go to instead.  Nevertheless, I tried Nando's because I'd tried their food at a catered event and I thought it was good.

Any way, we ordered a chimi and fajitas and a small pitcher of house margaritas.

Starting with the chips and salsa, I found both to be good.  The salsa that came in the miniature carafe war real good.  The one in the small bowl was meh.

The chimi was good and frankly a little more than I could eat.  Same with the fajitas.

The margaritas were meh.  There might have been liquor in there but I couldn't tell.  Also the mix was overly sweet so it continued to revisit me through most of the night.

The service while friendly was uneven at best.  We had to ask for things several times and it many cases what we asked for never came.

Overall I'd say the place was ok."}
{"text":"Visiting Mesa and we were looking for a Mexican restaurant. We were really please with the service , this place was clean and everyone was really friendly. We order an appetizer and it was deliciously we had the lunch special thinking the portion were going to be in the smaller siZe under 10.00. How ever we got full size orders. The food was delicious. Very satisfied with quality of food and service . Definitely will recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I did an extensive search for a green corn tamale with green sauce in the Gilbert/Mesa area that would be an equal to Ajo Al's in Scottsdale.  I was thrilled and delighted when I discovered Nando's.   Their green corn tamale is perfection on a plate.  My only complaint is they charge extra for a little additional green sauce."}
{"text":"We've been to this place at least a dozen times and it has always been good. Kind of a cross between authentic ad Americanized Mexican, they have a large menu and everything is tasty. We often end up here during happy hour and get the nacho's. OMG are they good. One order can easily feed 3-4. Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Yummy!! We love Nando's!! The pollo rico is amazing!"}
{"text":"This is my parent's Mexican restaurant of choice. I can see why. The portions are huge and everything is hot, fresh and tasty. 

Husband and I shared the crab and shrimp enchiladas, although it was a tough decision to make. Everything looked tempting. The enchiladas were quite good and definitely big enough to share. We both have big appetites but had taken advantage of the chips and salsa and ordered a quest dip for the table. The queso was rich and cheesey, served with flour tortilla chips - although I preferred the corn chips and used those to dip. 

If in the area again I would like to try the pollo rico - I have a serious weakness for jalapeno cream cheese."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and they give you pretty big portions for the price. The only thing I noticed was the restaurant seems kind of dirty. The menus had dried food on them and looking around they needed to wipe down the light and seats better. I ordered the pollo Rico, it was ok. The chicken was flavored well but a little dry. The burrito was supposed to be crispy but just the top of it was slightly crisp. The rest was just a warm tortilla. I would probably come again, just not my favorite Mexican place. I think Tia Rosa is much better."}
{"text":"I feel like trying out a new restaurant tonight and have seen this place a few times driving by.....oh why not? Tonight is the night. I walked in excited and walked out disappointed. 

I ordered the Tacos Al Carbon with steaks that comes with guacamole and Pico De Gallo. The meat portion is generous. However, it was very dry and tasteless. I simply couldn't eat another bite without adding hot sauce on them. The side dishes are average...nothing spectacular. The salsa....hmm...I've had better. 

Service is great. Special kuddos to Busboys who are working tonight. They are so quick at delivering the salsa and chips as soon as we sat down. I also saw how hard they work throughout the night. The owner definitely did a good job hiring hard workers. 

Overall, I think the food is ok....Im not sure if I will come back here again."}
{"text":"I always enjoy to read others bad reviews and what some people said of the service, I would have to agree on a certain level, but when going to a restaurant I only want the waiter to come by for our order and notice when our drinks are low.  That was accomplished on this visit and the food was amazing along with some good portions.  I had the chicken enchiladas and am definitely looking forward to coming back to visit."}
{"text":"I was here on 5/18/2015 with a group of about 40 people and their therapy dog on the patio. The service was outstanding and the food was hot and delicious. Good job and thank you very much for such outstanding evening."}
{"text":"Very good food and great service on a Saturday night.  Although they were busy, everything was terrific."}
