{"text":"Pas un expirience très positive à ce resto. La liste des vins est hors de prix (65$ minimum la bouteille). La nourriture trop dispendieuses, mes pates aux palourdes comprenait une palourde...."}
{"text":"Hmmm, this is a tough one.  I gave it 4 stars for the food, which was very good, but the vibe isn't really to my taste.  It's old-school, business district Italian...think tuxedoed waiters, wine cellars and steaks.  The pastas (all 3) were very good and the salads acceptable.  The complementary bruschetta, however, was excellent - among the best I've had.  The service was friendly and attentive.  The wandering guitar player was unobtrusive and enjoyable.  Next time we'll go to little Italy, but this place was recommended by a friend as his favourite in the city, and he has good taste.  I believe it has an excellent wine cellar."}

{"text":"Le muscadin is a great italian table that has been known for years and managed to stay authentic. Hidden in the old montreal, it has a very welcoming and convivial vibe. Leo Iacono, the owner is as friendly as one can be and it feels like he knows everything and everybody.  Uncomplicated and great would be the beat way to describe this restaurant.  The luch started with some pasta because what's more italian than pasta? Nothing. Extremely tasty.  Main course was a huge 25 days aged bistecca with a peppercorn sauce. It was cooked perfectly, juicy, tender and filled with taste.  Also an italian classic, dessert was a biscotti and cannoli. I finished my plate and my neighbor's. I could've eated a whole batch because it was so good!  There's also a huge and great selection of italian wines, I've also spotted some amazing grappa if you like that."}
{"text":"Endroit caché du Vieux-Montréal. Tout est parfait. Le décor, la bouffe (OMG LA BOUFFE), le vin (OMG LE VIN), le propriétaire, sa fille, les cuisines, bref, je vous jure, ce restaurant est un petit bijou! C'est cher, mais ça vaut tellement la peine! Rien à voir avec les restaurants italiens bas de gamme, celui-ci t'offrira une expérience culinaire hors du commun!   Félicitations, vous nous faites vivre une merveilleuse expérience!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, Superior service, Great wine list and the owner Leo is a true restaurateur orchestrating a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Le Muscadin is a wonderful Italian restaurant in old Montreal. The menu has many delicious choices including pastas and veal dishes. The wine list is one of the best I have seen anywhere. Service is flawless and the host will make you feel very welcome. The decor is upscale to match the food and wine so it's perfect for a special occasion, a romantic evening or get together for old friends. I will definitely return here for a memorable dining experience."}
