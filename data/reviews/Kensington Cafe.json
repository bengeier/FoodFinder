{"text":"Nothing on my 4.99 breakfast special plate tasted good. Manager was rude- asked for ketchup to cover up the taste and he said \"come up here and get it\""}
{"text":"Service is consistently bad but the crepes are worth coming back for if you live with in walking distance.  Definitely go around the corner to Moon Bean if you want a coffee!  They also use styrofoam for their take out containers and consistently get orders wrong."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years. Had a bad experience last time I was here. Remembered it being very unfriendly. But it looked like it might be under new manager so I decided to give it a try. Big mistake. The owner was surly, the food mediocre. Good coffee though."}
{"text":"Kensington Cafe was truly an A-OK, down to the tee. I came here on a day over the holidays, when nothing else was open in Kensington Market. The prices were more expensive than neighbouring Chinatown's, but nothing outrageous. Crepe and soup lunch combo cost me around $10. You order at a counter, cafeteria-style, pay right there, then grab a seat. They'll come and bring the food to you at your seat.  The ham-and-spinach crepe was okay. Like, just okay. I swear I've made better at home. It was thicker than I'd prefer and the fillings weren't that flavourful. It came with some kind of thick, bean-filled soup in a mug, which was nice at first because it was warm (and I was cold), but soon revealed itself to be unappetizing."}
{"text":"Just getting a quick bite to eat at Kensington market on my way to a foot massage, I came across Kensington at the corner of Baldwin and Kensington.  It's a sit down cafe, but orders are taken at the cash in the front.  It attracted me with the big sign that said Gluten Free Menu.   I've been on this restrictive food elimination diet now, so I certainly appreciated the option to find something that I can eat.  They have Gluten free Crepes (filled with pesto, spinach and sausage/bacon) or Muffins, and eggs with gluten free waffles, among some on the menu.   I got the Gluten free Crepe and requested the Vegan Pesto (no diary).  On the menu it said $9.99, but she charged me 10.65 with a drink. Something fishy.   They are slow to take your order, but quick in preparation. I noticed the order before me was made out of a premade crepe, and mine out of the batter from a bowl. Maybe they ran out, maybe my gluten free one is more fresh than the non, or she just forgot and charged me for the wrong one, which is why I went to my massage with the sniffles. I'm not sure.   I kind of expected the crepe to be put inside a paper bag (a la Crepes a Go Go) so I can eat and walk at the same time.  I don't know why I expected that and why I was shocked to be given a styrofoam box and cutlery.  I realized this is NOT crepes a gogo, and I sat down on one of hte swing set chairs and scarfed down my crepe.   It was good, a little mushy. Not sure if it was the gluten free ness.  Prices were a bit steep."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option on here for giving 0 stars because this place is really that bad. I guarantee that anyone who is familiar with Kensington market knows not to go to this cafe, especially when there are so many better alternatives in close proximity.  Moving away from the sub par food/service/atmosphere mentioned in the other reviews, the owner of the cafe is one of the most two-faced jerks I have ever met. I suppose this review is becoming a little personal now, but I just want to warn others to not be fooled by his facade. I will not discuss the details of our interaction, but he was extremely rude, when the situation did not necessitate such a response. I will make it my personal crusade to save as many oblivious tourists from wasting their money at this place."}
{"text":"Overall, not so impressed with the cafe. I had a spinach omelette with sausage and a chai latte. Everything was bland. No taste and pretty small portions. My chai cup was only half full... There are better restaurants for brunch in the area. Maybe this place is better served as a coffee on the go place rather than actual food."}
{"text":"Good coffee, and they appear to have a decent selection of food, even having some gluten-free items. However, the service is slow....they even forgot my order at one point, forgetting to take the pastry I selected to the table I was sitting at.  Also, with my cappuccino they gave me a stir stick, why? Plus, they sometimes use styrofoam plates for their food. Not only is it wasteful, it means if you have food to cut through, your knife or fork will go through the plate."}
{"text":"The Kensington Cafe might be remembered from a few years back as one of those greasy breakfast joints with great coffee and eclectic decore.  But, after a makeover mission provided by the Slice Network's \"Restaurant Makeover,\" the cafe was transformed in to a minimalist, streamlined gourmet french creperie serving all day breakfast in the form of upscale stuffed omelets, crepes, pastries and still, the amazing coffee, carefully selected and brewed by owner, Henrie Sibonney.    Being at the heart of Kensington Market, the Kensington Cafe is still a great place for hanging out, people watching, and, cruising the net thanks to the free wifi."}
