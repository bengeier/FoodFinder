{"text":"This place is consistently good. Normal food you would expect from a no frills fish and chips restaurant. Quality of food is slightly better than its competitors which is why I keep going back along with the friendly service I always receive."}
{"text":"this place been there for god knows how long....food is always been good....i love it...
and the cashier were very nice everytime....shrimps were very goodddd.....
and yah i saw the review from Quan P...... i think you were wrong about that place....
shrimps was fresh made....i saw it !!!!!! yum......and keep in mind that you are in AZ....
not texa or cali......most of the seafood are frozen here.....compare to other fish and 
chips around that area that was the best one i ever try.....XDXDXD...i dont know wut 
make u say that place is bad....but personally i think is really good.....=]"}
{"text":"This place while cheap is horrible. The cocktail sauce is completely watered down and all the food is just frozen food that's been thrown in the deep fryer. The service was fine but this place is far from what you would consider a decent fish and chips place. Avoid this place. I should have tried Rice to You (next door) instead."}
{"text":"All I can do is be honest. I'm a truck driver I travel a lot I try to find little places that have good food I stopped in here expecting some delicious fish and french fries and what I got was 2 pieces of soggy fish when I ordered 3 and some cold french fries and the worst part of sauce I've ever seen in my life the place was filthy and the food was horrible I'll never be back"}
{"text":"HEY LISTEN, I've been eating this stuff since the the 80's when it opened. Before then, Pete's was the only game around(and still kicks ass to this day I'm sure). Anyhow, I now live in PHILLY and can't get anything like this here. Only a memory of what I once had just a few streets down the way. I'll trade you a cheesesteak any day of the week for a 12 piece and extra sauce."}
{"text":"More pricey than petes, smaller serving size, but good flavoring and doesnt feel like everything is covered in batter. Service was fast but it was also not so busy when I came"}
{"text":"0 stars. Stay away from this place the food is disgusting. Got the fish and chips with shrimp.  Everything had no flavor and the fries were cold and soggy. Eveything is frozen! The fish literally tasted like a fried fishstick. Stay away don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people might be fake on here, but I'm far from that. If i could literally give them a negative star i would. I wanted fish & chips and this was the closet to me so i said ok let's try it. I walked in and it needed a major upgrade, however some places that look horrible are sometimes the best places. Not this place, i placed my order $16.71. I sat down and as i waited i saw a cockroach run across the floor. I got up and without making a scene told the girl at the register that i would like my money back please cuz of the roach. She tried to tell me that their clean but i told her no i saw what i saw and i want my money back, i paid with my debit but they did give me cash so that was good. But yes this place is no good"}
{"text":"Do not i repeat do not eat here it tast like its frozen and it well hurt you later"}
{"text":"This place is delicous. Its not the best fish and chips you will ever have but its one of the only ones in the area.This is one of the only non-mexican restaurants left in Maryvale. If this place ever closed it would be the final nail in the coffin. There are literally 20 restaurants with in a 5 mile radius of this place ALL mexican food or major chain fast food. If you dont like this place then go to one of those disgusting places that sells you cow fat and tells you its carne asada lmfao. Or charges you 30 dollars for a 6 oz shrimp cocktail. Please NEVER close down Q's!"}
{"text":"when i was in high school a friend of mine worked here. one day while at work he was bored and put his boot in the fryer. lol. it melted his heel. i remember the food being decent at best and the location was pure scary. i also heard a urban myth about this place. Ed and Pete were close friends and they both had a fish an chip place, and they were partners. Pete wanted to expand, Ed didn't, Ed ended up dead. murdered under suspicious cercumstances...then Pete opened up a few other shops...now you see Pete all over the valley..and Ed just gets a crappy review from me. 

i wonder how much of the above is true. i'm too lazy to look up police records to confirm it. but none the less. a great phoenix foodie urban myth. Candyman Candyman Candyman Candyman Candyma......"}
