{"text":"Awesome people and the owner super friendly. We got the chicken wings and it's to die for!"}
{"text":"I don't ever leave yelp reviews. It really takes something to get me on this app and spend the time making a review. This place is awesome!!! The cheesesteaks are amazing!! The cheese fries are amazing!! I love cheesesteak sandwiches and this place is no joke. And the customer service has always been great here. Super friendly!! Straight From Philly is great, end of story!!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this gem and the cheesesteaks and cheeseburgers were awesome! The fries were excellent too!"}
{"text":"We like the cheesesteaks double meat and grilled onions.  Reminds me of the cheesesteaks from the east coast.  It's so yummy!  The only thing I didn't like is they aren't open when I get off of work."}
{"text":"Great cheesesteak! Nice to go to a place that knows how to make a good Philly sandwich. They use Amorosa rolls and hot cheese wiz. Have been back 2 times and I can honestly say it has been consistently great."}
{"text":"Me and the wife were in downtown Henderson. And suggested to get some lunch so I naturally Yelped it. This place came up .5 miles away good reviews so I said let's go!

 Ordered the S. Philly she got the Da Beefy along with some garlic cheese fries to go. Employee were friendly think the gentleman was the owner very pleasant to talk to. Said thank you and shook my hand on the way out as he gave us our order.

 Ok home now garlic fries were awesome should have gotten 2 orders 1 for myself. My  cheese steak was awesome plenty of meat tender cheese mushrooms onions peppers was great experience to eat. Wife loved her beefy now she's not a big eater considering this size of the sandwich they were pretty good size. She ate the whole thing and that in my world that says a lot. She enjoyed it. 

Will be back nice to find and a experience a good gem  in Henderson!!!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are really tasty, but it's a bit pricy. I got the North Philly which has onions, green bell peppers, mushrooms, and Provolone for $9.45. The sandwich is huge though, I ate half and took the rest home. Even my husband couldn't finish his meal.

We were there on a Friday which is apparently free fries day, awesome! The fries are free with your order, they don't just hand them out when you walk in the door, lol."}
{"text":"This place makes a delicious philly! Actually, the best I've had in this town. I'm not from Philly or anything, but it's one of my favorite sandwiches. The bread is the key to this delicious philly. It's soft and holds the meat and cheese perfectly. I have been craving this place since the last time I went. So happy it's by my house"}
{"text":"Awesome amazing Philly cheese steaks.... you can order it any way you like.. Cheese, extra items banana peppers etc.....Friday was free fries!!! My daughter is 10 and very picky , she couldn't stop telling me how good it was...... not to mention they are huge!!!!!
The restaurant is nice and small enough to feel like a neighborhood secret, with a very clean and stylish atmosphere. I recommend this place to everyone that's craving a juicy, authentic Philly or a great cheeseburger!!!!"}
{"text":"Unreal, I would give it a 10 if I could. Food experience was outstanding. Their fries are perfection, well seasoned/battered and cheesesteaks are euphoric. You MUST try it. The outside when we parked seemed kinda sketch, but inside is very clean. Going on our top 5 for sure."}
{"text":"went there today food was EXCELLENT !! recommend. parking lot was getting lines painted so was blocked off, had to walk a little bit, but was worth the walk."}
{"text":"The food is just like the service AWSOME everything about the service is simply amazing gyros the burgers is breathtaking and the chesse steaks are wonderful  ....."}
{"text":"The prices are slightly more expensive than, say, Capriotti's, but with good reason.

Went here with 2 friends; they got the South Philly cheesesteak and I just got a bacon burger (I'm boring, admittedly). The burger was huge, the cheesesteaks were loaded, and everything was delicious. The only thing to watch out for is that burgers come with fries, but cheesesteaks don't -- you have to get those separately.

Food is made fresh when you order it, so it takes a bit longer than most other places, but it tastes a lot better.  And if that wasn't enough, for the time being, you get a free scoop of Thrifty ice cream. Can't beat that.

Overall, an amazing first impression. Definitely going back sooner than later."}
{"text":"The cheesesteak sandwich was really good. This one had grilled onions on it. The food came out fast and was still hot. All the food is cooked to order. Nice and helpful staff."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a Philly cheesesteak place for a while now and have always been skeptical of this place just cause the location. But I finally decided to go in and all I can say is wow! I will be a repeat customer cause those are some of the best cheesesteaks I have ever had."}
{"text":"Being from NY spending my summers at the Jersey shore enjoying Philly cheese steaks. This place brought back memories. Regular Philly with bell peppers and onions and provolone cheese. 
My granddaughters first ever. And she said ummm yummy in my tummy."}
{"text":"We were here at 10:45. Thought we would checkout a new place. But guy was rude and said sorry not open til 11 no menu was offered, Or if you wait 15 minutes we would love to have your business. I would think with a small business like this you would cater to locals. Probably great food based on pics online. Good luck."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after reading some good reviews on yelp. Great decision!! We will absolutely be going back. Delish and great price with free Thrifty's ice cream. The only downside is that its tucked back in a mostly empty lot so people can't see it. Hope that doesn't affect the traffic it may or may not get too much. Totally recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place, the cheesesteaks are awesome. But my favorite is the pretzel cheese burger! They aslo some very delicious addictive sides, like the onion rings and parmesan garlic fries. Thank you coming to Vegas (^_-)"}
{"text":"I can get my grease fix AND get free ice cream!?!? SUCH good food. Always add bacon."}
{"text":"1 star, because the option of negative stars is not an option.
I WILL NOT BE BACK.
No actual website should have been my first clue, and only having a menu available via Facebook is even worse.
Guess what? Not everyone on the planet has a  Facebook account!
I went in the \"store\" to place an order, and as soon as I walked in, I noticed NO other customers inside.
It doesn't even seem like a business to me, more like a failed experiment, and someplace to bring in the workers family, and friends, and kids.
I ordered anyway, hoping that the food would be good, and when I handed my card to the man that took my order, he raised his voice at the woman next to him \"Where's my phone?\"
Weird? Yes. 
She brings him his phone, and swipes my card with his Square reader, and hands me my card, and tell me that my food would be ready shortly.
As for Square, I did not sign anything,or provide my PIN, nor was I given the option to.
OK. I sit. I wait.........................
At least the woman that made my sandwich wore gloves.
After less than 10  minutes, the same man tells me my order is ready, and I stand up, grab my food, and leave.
When I got home, I found no receipt in the bag, and start to question this \"businesses\" professional practices, once again.
The cheese steak was mediocre at best, greasy, and the bread was soggy.
Maybe because I am not \"Straight from Philly\" I was not impressed with the food.
I can say, that i have spent some time in Philly, and have had MUCH better cheesesteaks there.
There are much better cheesesteaks in town, and I recommend trying any other place than this one."}
{"text":"Finally a real Philly cheesesteak in Henderson!! I'm from the tri state area close to Philly and I can tell you this place is spot on. I was skeptical walked into their brand new location on Water and lake mead and it was slow but my steak sandwich as my late grandma would call it was to die for. No more capriottis that place is crap  can't wait to try yall again I work nearby a lot so I'm sure I'll be in your new location !!"}
{"text":"Great cheese steak. The sandwich was big and full of meat. The bread was cooked perfect. The staff was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places around for a cheese steak. Try it you will like it.  It is our place for cheese steaks sandwiches!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there as I had never had a cheese steak. If that is what a cheese steak is I say \"fuhgeddaboudit\" The meat was not bad but the bread was dry (stale) and I thought there would be cheese whiz on the bread; well I guess there was - they put it on each side in the thinnest of layers like one would spread butter. And the fries? Horrible, horrible - so much salty seasoning they were not edible. Don't waste your time and specially your money - they are not worth the over priced food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Got the Bacon Cheesesteak, extra meat, with mushrooms and fried onions.  All I could eat and then some!!  Came here an hour before close and everyone is pleasant and having fun."}
{"text":"Killer Food!!!  I had a regular cheese steak and it was just as good as I could possibly make myself at home, which is not what I can say for a lot of fast food restaurants.  I shared an order of the bacon cheese fries with my daughter and not only were the fries ridiculously delicious!! the bacon was fresh and spread liberally all over my fries with cheese (the way bacon cheese fries should be made).  Finally my daughter had a gyro that came with fries and both were also delicious, the gyro meat was made very well and could put some \"greek\" restaurant gyros around town to shame.  Good work Straight from Philly, please have menus we can take home or post your menu on social media."}
{"text":"Awesome. Food was great, service and atmosphere was great. We loved it. Parking is rough but everything else makes up for it."}
{"text":"My first trip here, it was recommended to us by friends. It didn't disappoint! Great cheese steak, I've been craving this sandwich since I left Cincinnati 2 years ago, I got my fix there at Penn Station . Well now I've got a place to get my craving satisfied."}
{"text":"Just stopped in before the Eagles play the Bears on Monday night football to try a cheese steak. Great job straight from Philly!!!   I'm from Philly, born and raised.  While others advertise Philly cheese steaks, but fall way short, this place is definitely a great stop for a taste of home for me. Thanks D...  Go Birds!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok let's go review time at Straight outta Philly.  I Ordered Da Beefy Extra cheese add pickles onions and mustard. I will tell you what .... BOMB. Good solid food and sweet nice helpful employees. A little pricey you WONT be disappointed I promise. It's worth the money. Highly recommend you support this local business"}
{"text":"I finally made a Yelp account just so I could write about Straight From Philly. 

My girlfriend and I were hungry but were feeling too lazy to go anywhere, so I hopped on Eat24 and started looking for places that deliver, that aren't pizza joints. I saw this place on there and after seeing pictures of the cheesesteak I could not freakin' resist ordering. 

I got the Jalapeno  Cheesesteak and she got the All American burger. We also picked up an extra order of fries and some of their onion rings.

Took about 45-60 minutes for delivery but it was so incredibly worth the wait. The Jalapeno Cheesesteak is easily the best I've had anywhere in the Las Vegas Valley, or elsewhere for that matter. It was freakin' loaded with meat and jalapenos, after my first bite I knew I found my new favorite restaurant. My girlfriend loved her burger and we both agreed the onion rings and fries were to die for. 

Anyways, just thought I should share how amazing this place is. Thank you for the amazing food and I guarantee we will be eating here again!  

- Ricky H."}
{"text":"This is is so good and authentic. Its my favorite spot to go to that quick philly fix."}
{"text":"Philly Cheesesteak was really good.  Love it a lot.  Gonna be one of my place to eat when I am in the area"}
{"text":"We went to this new location on opening day. It's one thing I like to see is how well they have their *stuff* together,  and this location did! 

I had the Gyro and fries ($8.15) and my partner had a Mushroom cheesteak ($8.95). The food took a while to come out,  but we didn't mind the wait knowing everything was prepared fresh.  Their cheesteaks come with American cheese but you can substitute provolone,  swiss,  or 'Whiz'. 

They offer delivery within the local area for $2.00 delivery charge. 

Overall, a great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best cheesesteak places I've ever been to. Great flavor and free fries on Friday (Fryday)!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday to pick up lunch and it was very tasty !! Glad for more choices to eat in ole Henderson. Yes, I will be back and back and backtelling my family and friends about this place"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff with great customer service! The cheesesteaks were amazing too!! I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Cheese steak done right!
Probably the best cheese steak on the western side of the country. I'm a truck driver and travel the entire continental U.S. The only thing you might want to change is ask for extra cheese, because they give you soooooo much steak! Now that's the kind of problem I like to have. I also had the garlic parmesan fries. So good, I was torn on what to eat first. But don't worry I figured it out. Both at the same time."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on yelp I decided to try Straight From Philly.  The food is so good that it is ridiculous.  The service was exceptional.  I ordered a Steak & Cheese with onions for myself and ordered a Steak & Cheese with mushrooms, onions and bell peppers for my husband.  Also ordered onion rings.  The girl behind the counter was extremely sweet and I also talked to a really funny and nice guy (do not know if he was the owner) who told me the meat and rolls come directly from Philly.  As I waited for the take out I looked the restaurant over and found it to be very clean.  Interesting posters on the walls and overall a very cute place.  They also offer delivery.  I arrived a little before opening time at 11:00 a.m. and they let me in and took my order.  We loved the sandwiches.  So hot and delicious and full of meat and toppings.  The onion rings were perfect.  I wasn't sure of what my husband's reaction would be as he is pretty particular about Philly cheesesteak sandwiches.  He said it was absolutely fantastic.  I agreed.  Dangerous thing is this restaurant is less than two miles from my house!  I had no trouble finding it.  It is across the street from the Walmart Neighborhood Market at the corner of Stephanie and American Pacific.  There is a gas station located on the corner of the strip mall that the restaurant is located in.  It is so worth it!!  Thanks Straight From Philly for making such delicious food!"}
{"text":"This places is awesome can't find a good cheesesteak unless I make it myself and these guys just kill it! Awesome family staff and did anyone mention the FREE ice cream to finish off the meal."}
{"text":"Come try straight from Philly I am the new cook i will Gauruntee that you will love it so people that put a bad reviews come back too  try us out again u well leave Satisfied"}
{"text":"Cheesesteaks are one of my favorite go to foods and it's hard to find a good one! I can stop looking in Henderson now...this place,  from the food to the service to the cleanliness. ....by far the best! They have many options to choose from for their cheesesteaks.....all great! Definitely a gem in Henderson."}
{"text":"It's a new sandwich place and it's near school so I like its proximity. The service was fast, the food was great, and in a good portion for the price. The staff is very friendly too. I'd definitely recommend the place for people looking for a delicious sandwich in Henderson."}
{"text":"I'm from Philadelphia. These are the best cheesesteaks in Las Vegas. 

First time there I had an American wit. (American cheese, with onions). It was great. But the best part about this place is the variety of sandwiches. Second time I was there I got the Cubano, which is basically a fried Cuban sandwich prepared like a cheese steak. Fantastic. 

They know how to make sandwiches, so having a variety totally works here. Great place."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and well made. It's in a quiet spot in Old Henderson. Vibe is a little odd, the staff seems a little indifferent to your presence, but the sandwiches and fries are top notch."}
{"text":"Best burger ever, juicy and delicious!! Huge brger and a big amount of fries for a great price. Definitely recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Fries were not hot, barely warm! If you like meat in your sandwich, don't go here.  No hair covers on both the cooks hair! Never saw any hand washing either! Pretty expensive for what we received!!! Won't go back! Good luck!!!"}
{"text":"Well, I'm  straight from Philly too.. and would easily eat at least 4 cheese steaks a week. In all my years back home in Philly where I was born and raised, I've  always had my cheese steak  the same way ( fried onions, mushrooms, cheese, hot peppers  with tomatoes cooked in.  For some reason the guy at this location refused to cook the tomatoes in with my cheesesteak he offered to put them on top and make me a cheesesteak hoagie but that's not what I wanted unfortunately I will never know what the food here taste like, too bad customer service has gone away. I guess the tomatoes might have damaged the grill.
I'm pretty sure you have forgotten what a cheesesteak represented back home !!"}
{"text":"Our washing machine died, so we went to the laundromat on Lake Mead and Water Street, waiting for our laundry went next door to try the philly steak sandwiches and it was AMAZING! Reminded me of when I was in Philadelphia! Sooooooo gooooood!"}
{"text":"Man o man you can't go wrong here. The Phillys are made right in front of you. Hands down the best sandwiches ever! Will come here again when I'm Vegas. By the way, the subs are huge!!!"}
{"text":"O my philly loving cheesesteak! I have never had such a good cheesesteak outside of philly. Please go here and spread the word!"}
{"text":"We found this place by chance and glad we did!  The fries are excellent along with the classic Philly Cheese Steak.  Ordered 2 more to go afterwards, for later!  Will be back every we pass through!  Can't remember when I had one better than this!  Excellent food!"}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch! Occasionally they get backed up though. They are pretty small so you have to be ready to deal with slow service if they are backed up. They are polite and try to accommodate. The food is great! I love ti!"}
{"text":"The best philly steak sandwich that I have had in this city!!!!!!!!!!!! Very friendly owners and great food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST Philly Cheesesteak I've ever had!!! I got the North Philly. Veggies were cooked perfectly, the meat was juicy,  and the right amount of cheese and seasoning. Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing.... i lived in philly for 6 years and this is the real deal. Everything was delicious!!! I defiently will be a regular."}
{"text":"Great place for a Philly cheesesteak! The outside scared me but thanks to yelp it has taught me that means nothing! Great family owned business. Past this place many times over the years and never stopped by. Man was I missing out! The gentlemen behind the counter makes you feel like family and super respectful. The garlic parm cheese steak wit wiz was incredible!!"}
{"text":"Soda machine didn't work and there was Meat sitting out. I have eaten in Philly for years and this place wouldn't last a day. No wonder they came to Vegas"}
{"text":"The people here are great. Very nice. They offer great suggestions and get everything to you quickly. The food is crack... For lack of better words. I've tried almost everything and havnt made a bad choice yet! Plus, free ice cream!"}
{"text":"To be honest, im not sure if it came from this location or the original one. This one doesnt have a listed phone number. I had called to put in an order for delivery for myself and one other while we were at work. Orders were placed over the phone and stated delivery in 30-40 minutes. Considering it took like 10-15 minutes to cook my 1 order when i went to the original location, 30-40 minutes? dang they good

Ordered a jalapeno cheesesteak with fried onions and a banana pepper cheesesteak with fried onions with specific instructions for a side of mustard for both. Order came in about 45 minutes direct to the department i work in. Nice and hot. Granted we got busy so couldn't eat it so it sat for a while. 

We ate it maybe 30-60 minutes later. some areas of the bread (ends) got hard and the meat got dry. no mustard either. 

For $2 delivery, not bad when you work in a busy unknown environment like mine.

Cash and credit accepted."}
{"text":"Great sandwich, had the spicy red peppers. Free fries on Friday and free ice cream everyday."}
{"text":"Great philly cheese steak!!!!
Probably the best I've ever had. Delicious. Try it!
Nice people too."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak I've had in a long time. The last time was back in Philly 5 years ago. We will be back here often!!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE 2.2.18

Experienced horrible food and absolutely no customer service once I left the store. There must be a new management and new cook because the steaks are terrible now. I'm from Philly and chopped onions are understood not the whole damn onion slabbed on your sammich. Hair literally fried in French fries. Called several times. Left voicemails, stopped by and hours were changed yet again since the day I initially came in. Poor poor poor management!!!"}
{"text":"Location isn't anything fancy, but the food is cheap and good. Several $8 lunch combo options available, the namesake Philly sandwiches are the specialty, fries are skin-on, lightly seasoned, and tasty. Bonus points for a variety of house-made hot sauces at the condiment bar and free ice cream  \"samples\" for dessert!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and the food was great. We had the Garlic Parm Cheesesteak!!!  Fries were awesome too!!  I would have taken a picture but it was gone too fast!"}
{"text":"I take my cheesesteaks very seriously. Came here while waiting at the DMV, and I was a little skeptical. Boy was I glad I came. Now I've traveled all over searching for the best cheesesteak, today I had the South Philly. It was Amazing!!!! With a capital A baby! To the point that I even had to get a second to go just to prove to my buddy that it's the best in town. I will definitely be back not only for the huge selection of cheesesteaks but the EXCELLENT service as well!!! Thanks Straight from Philly, I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. This hit the spot if you're craving philly steak sandwich. Also, not sure if the owners are aware. But there are 2 other locations called \"straight from philly Steakout\" with the same exact menu. I know this location been around longer than these chains. Just a FYI."}
{"text":"I dont usually do yelp reviews, but these philly cheesesteaks are amazing! I reccomend the philly cheesesteak hoagie and the philly cheesesteak fries."}
{"text":"Place has good cheesesteaks, but I wouldn't recommend calling in an order to pick up. I've attempted to call in twice today, both times I was placed on hold (no please), only to sit there for 3 minutes before hanging up each time. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Strange place with really odd service.  Decent food but nothing blew me away.  The restaurant is in this weird plaza that's right near a shady motel and my wife felt unsafe when we got there (it's not actually unsafe, but she is generally paranoid about that stuff).  The menu is pretty extensive at first glance but a lot of what they listed was unavailable.  They are not friendly at all and I was not all that satisfied with the food.  Not horrible and my group seemed to like their food, but not a place I'll ever return to on purpose."}
{"text":"This is a MUST visit! After driving by this place many times, we finally decided to stop in and don't regret it! Best Philly cheesesteak I've had besides from the east coast. The whiz is a must and the fries and onion rings are a great side. We will be visiting more often."}
{"text":"Went to this joint after my Doctor's appointment.. I couldn't believe this place has been here for awhile.  The food was delicious. Enormous sandwiches.. Nice and friendly staff..  This place is kinda far from where I live but I wouldn't mind driving here to get my Philly cheesesteak fix.. Thank you for the good eats guys."}
{"text":"Mmmmm mmmm good! Took a lil bit to find but well worth it!! Ordered a cheesteak with grilled onions n spicy something tomato or peppers? The guy I ordered from suggested I get the Monday special free fries n drink with purchase of cheesteak. Thank you!  The fries were right outta the fryer n super delicious I chowed down on em before getting home. The cheesteak was very flavorful and real steak. I think it would have been good without the spiciness but that made it WOW! Sorry Dave @ capriotti's this is my new go to when I have a hankering 4 cheesteak. .."}
{"text":"This place is the business, The chicken cheese steak sandwich is and the onion rings, and fries are  as well and to top it all off the owner bruh you real cool 100%"}
{"text":"Authentic meats and breads shipped in regularly from Philly put these guys head and shoulders above the rest!"}
{"text":"Extremely poor experience here.  The menu did not list that there was pork on the cheesesteak, which is not a typical cheese steak ingredient anyway, however it came out with pork.  This place refused to change the sandwich.  You don't present surprise ingredients that aren't listed on the menu to the customer and then tell the customer that it's their mistake."}
{"text":"wanted to check this place out for awhile. I really enjoy a good Philly sandwich. I've never been on the east coast so can't compare this to what a genuine Philly Cheese steak sandwich tastes like or is suppose to taste like. I ordered the Jalapeno Cheese steak sandwich. My wife ordered the Turkey Hoagie. My sandwich was pretty good. I was disappointed because they didn't use cheese whiz. So I'm assuming you have to specify what kind of cheese you want on your sandwich. The wifey said her sandwich was good but on the bland side. The place looks kinda ghetto but not to bad. It is a small place with not many tables. Don't come here if you're in a rush because they take longer then they should. It wasn't busy but we waited for more than 15 minutes for two sandwiches and a burger. They have a special that includes a cheese steak sandwich and fries with a drink. What they don't tell you is it is only until 4pm. I was bummed because that's what i wanted. So my wife and I got sandwiches and my son got a cheeseburger with fries. My daughter got a drink and our bill came out to $50! So this place isn't cheap. Most of their sandwiches cost over 9 bucks. Also they advertise ice cream but they don't sell ice cream anymore. It's funny because they have a poster of ice cream on their wall. This place is just ok. Nothing special and we probably won't be back, just not enough to revisit."}
{"text":"Hi my name is Bethany and I'm addicted to cheesesteak sandwiches.

Whew! Now that I have that off of my shoulders, I can tell you what a great sandwich I enjoyed here! There are many restaurants I dine at where all I order is the cheesesteak sandwich.  I was happy to hear Straight from Philly opened up.  They have so many different cheesesteak options to choose from.  Aside from those they also offer gyros and burgers.  If you happen to be from Philly, you can order the sandwich 'Wit or Wit out'. 

I chose the North Philly.  The meat was seasoned well then grilled with mushrooms, onions and peppers.  This great combination of ingredients was then laid over provolone.  The roll was packed so full I was wishing I split it with my husband.  I would recommend this sandwich anytime.  

It is located to the right of Henry's Grill.  Plenty of parking and easy to find!  I can't wait to dine with them again."}
{"text":"To be honest, I have not had a lot of philly cheese steak sandwiches. But I got the mushroom philly cheese steak and it was really delicious. Bread was super soft, meat was well cooked, grilled onions and the melted cheese tasted awesome. Kinda empty and quiet when we went inside. No idea why considering how cheap and good the sandwich was. To sum it up...

1) Super cheap. Especially on mondays, comes with free drink and fries!
2) Free scoop of Thrifty ice cream with ANY purchase!!!

The place is pretty great. I love it. It is kind of hard to find because they don't have an official sign, just a banner. So it was hard to find at night.

They have daily deals Monday-Saturday. I personally think Monday is the best, with the free fries and drink. I think other days, you get extra toppings, or free drink, or it's a couple bucks cheaper. I forget.

So for $10, you get a bomb ass philly cheese steak sandwich, fries, drink, and thrifty ice cream on Mondays. That's 5 stars in my book.

Oh yeah, Free Ice cream with any purchase on anyday******


******edit) apparently they don't have the daily specials anymore.  =("}
{"text":"Holy cow! That's what I said when I had my first cheesesteak from here. It was a pretty  generous serving of chopped up and well seasoned beef packed onto a large hoagie roll. The beef is flavorful and oozed of greasy juice goodness. Good stuff! 

Not a big fan of bread and I usually get burgers wrapped in lettuce but was fine with it here since you really need a fork to eat your sandwich.  I just had it opened faced way and put the top part of the hoagie roll aside. 

Dont mistake this place for the other cheesesteak franchise with a similar name. This Straight From Philly is owner operated and run by a family. Everything here is cooked to order. The menu is pretty extensive. They offer a variety of different ways you can have your cheesesteak. With sweet peppers, hot peppers, mushrooms, genoa salami, grilled onions...and even steak with no cheese..(who does that?) 

So far I have tried the Cheesesteak Bomb with Genoa Salami and the Sweet Pepper Cheesesteak. Since Im more of a veggie type of person, I like the sweet pepper cheesesteak better than the all meat one.

The sandwich shop is fast food type of joint. It used to be a ice cream/hot dog place couple years ago.  If you remember the space that occupied here, they kept the bright yellow black/white checked walls minus the retro wall decor that used to be there. They still have the ice cream case, but not sure if they sell ice cream. Dining area is real casual, metal table and chairs along the wall Small space but plenty of room to move. 

The owners are cool and our orders came out in a timely manner considering it was pretty busy and it's just the two of them working. Not sure though about hours of operation. Came down late Saturday afternoon only to find the place closed for the day. Lights out. Store hours on window, on Yelp and their fB page says 11-9pm ,so we're a bit disappointed we couldnt have our cheesesteak fix.

Prices seem reasonable enough for me...then again Im that person who doesnt even look at pricetags and just drops everything in the shopping cart when Im with Mr. B. ..but under $10 for a Philly Cheesesteak with lots of meat is a bargain in my book.  Fast becoming another regular customer here too!  


Things to note: Close on Sundays - They also have Chicken aka Philly style, burgers and gyros on the menu.. and they have delivery service!"}
{"text":"Delivery Disappointed!

I wish I could give a review!  Food & reviews look great!  

VERY excited to see another cheese steak restaurant that delivers, especially one on GrubHub.  I read others reviews, saw the pictures, and was excited to order my first cheese steak from Straight From Philly.  After going through the menu and placing the order through GrubHub, I received a phone call from GH telling me that they could not deliver my order.  Why are you listed as \"Delivery\", if you do not?  A little frustrating, but now with the craving for a cheese steak, I'll call my go-to cheese steak delivery restaurant."}
{"text":"Omg then cheesesteak here is effing amazing. It was so good I ordered another one to go. I totally recommend this place to all who love beef. #yum"}
{"text":"Pretty good . Got the garlic philly.    There could have been more meat on it and a choice of breads.    Very spartan atmosphere/ decor.   Additional parking by motel."}
{"text":"BEST Cheesesteaks in the valley. Huge portions, great lunch specials, puts naked city's fries to shame!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I have only been a couple times but the staff is super friendly and their food is amazing. Doug helped us tonight and we were very pleased with his customer service. 840pm and he is still smiling and being attentive to his customers. He made sure to let us know that while we waited, we could refill our drinks as needed. Prices are great along with the food. Overall a great atmosphere and a friendly place to eat. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich!  Omg... it was SO good. I got the chicken philly with peppers and had to force myself to not eat the entire thing at once!  The jalapeño chili cheese fries are also very good... very heavy and a total belly buster but so so so good!"}
{"text":"Very good, reminded me of a steak from Philly..
Will be back
Good price, 
Clean shop
They have steaks from all over the city of Philadelphia so that was nice to see."}
{"text":"My husband recently introduced me to the wonderful deliciousness that is Straight from Philly. I'm now OBSESSED. I've ordered the garlic chicken cheesesteak, and it does not disappoint. Their regular cheesesteaks are also great. I am also now a complete fan of their fries...YUM!! I better get my workout on because I'm sure I'll be eating here frequently from now on. (:"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews and knowing my favorite cheesesteak is always wit whizzzz... I just had to visit this local spot!  Boy am I glad I did....I had the south philly with grilled onions which is steak, mushrooms, bell peppers and of course WHIZZZZ and let me say it was outstanding!  I think it may have weighed 10 pounds!  This will definitely be on my list as a return spot every time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and very friendly service. Was happy to see that they are opening one closer to me. They are rather $$$ but a good cheese steak is hard to find"}
{"text":"The cheesesteak was good--very greasy and very big portions. That said, it's a Philly cheesesteak what else do you expect! The only downside was the fries--not a fan. I ordered the garlic parm fries and they could have been a bit more crunchy--as the garlic butter and Parmesan made them a little soggy. Either way, it's good food but prepare to not want to move or do anything productive the entire day after eating these huge sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I didn't realize I hadn't reviewed them yet. They seriously have the best damn cheesesteaks I've had. They are also super friendly and affordable. 
I've had regular phillys and mushroom philly as well as their garlic Parmesan fries and boy oh boy. I love everything so much. Personally I love mushrooms so the mushroom philly is amazing. I'm slowly trying more and more on the menu and I doubt I'll be disappointed.

The meat/cheese ratio is perfect it's savory but not too too heavy. Rich flavor. I don't know what to say other than this is my absolute favorite shop."}
{"text":"This place makes a solid Philly cheese steak. Came here in between games. Staff was friendly and the food came out quick. Fries were crispy but if I had one thing to knock is it was a lil bland but overall a great sandwich"}
{"text":"Just had another cheese steak. This time, I made sure that I did not get the whiz on it. Much better! It was my mistake last time in not ensuring that I ordered it with provolone. It was really good! When I want a cheese steak again, I'm going to come here first."}
{"text":"Really good cheese steaks...poor customer service

I ordered this off of grub hub

I ordered the bacon chicken cheese steak for myself and the chicken cheese steak for the little guy. Both sandwiches were delicious, but the customer service was terrible. They arrive 10 minutes earlier than quoted, which is a good thing in my opinion. However, when the food arrived the woman was very rude, didn't even say hi, she just said \"for future reference, make sure you add a gate code to the instructions.\" I replied with \"I thought I did\" and she said no and then left. Less than 5 minutes later, I get a phone fall from her saying she's sorry, and that I did write the gate code in...regardless, she should have handled it differently. Also, i ordered extra ranch, and only got one half filled ramekin. Even though the sandwiches are really good and taste like home, I doubt I'll order again."}
{"text":"After posting a less than favorable review on this business, the owner felt the need to reply to my original review saying that he will \"pray for me\".... which isn't something a professional business owner should say to his customers, especially when word of mouth is one of the best proven methods for advertising.

The food was actually quite good enough to consider eating there again, but sadly, based on his awful attitude and lack of empathy for my less-than-stellar experience, he made me decide not only to NOT eat there ever again, but to make sure none of my friends do either. 

For a business that hasn't been open that long, you'd think he'd have a better understanding of what customer service (and YELP) is all about."}
{"text":"Love this place, good lunch specials and good food. I have never been to Philly, but for now this is as close as I will get."}
{"text":"I've been here a ton already because this is hands down the best cheesesteak I've ever had.  The first time I came here I ordered the bacon cheesesteak which was pretty good; however my next visit (and every visit since) I had the 'Atomic Garlic Parm Cheesesteak' and it was amazing.  I haven't gotten another type of cheesesteak since.  I also love their Garlic Parm fries, they are the best I've had in the Vegas area ever.  One thing I would say, if you are going to order the best cheesesteak (Atomic Garlic Parm) you have to eat it there at the store because they are so juicy and delicious it ends up a bit soggy if you have to take it all the way home.  Cheesesteaks are one of my all-time favorite foods period, and this place serves the best ones in town.  The owners have also been really nice to me.  They always have explained things, and offered me refills every time.  They actually seem to go over the top on trying to be friendly which I think could creep some people out, but honestly the world needs more of that these days so I enjoy it.  BTW, this place looks like the tiniest hole in the wall type of place and it isn't situated in the nicest area of Henderson, but don't let that bother you or you will be missing out on a great cheesesteak."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE cheesesteaks and this place has some pretty bomb cheesesteaks! The service was great didn't have to wait long at all, very friendly employees. I recommend this place to anyone wanting a good meal for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Always a friendly place to walk into. Love that they are family owned and they get down with old school music. They have really good food as well. I always get the super gyro and it's so good. I try to come here and try something else but I always go back to the gyro. Kids love it here too"}
{"text":"When you put the name Philly on a cheesesteak place, you better be able to back it up.  Today, I found out Straight From Philly deserves that Philly name.  Look forward to more cheesesteaks in the future."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak I've ever had in Vegas! Prices are very reasonable and staff are friendly. Can't wait to go back and take my family there."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times now and have had mixed experiences. They have a wide menu selection, lunch specials, and daily specials. There's something for everyone, even vegetarians! The cheesesteaks are generally consistent and very authentic so I'll keep coming back for the sandwiches, but I agree with some reviewers that the cheese is often pretty skimpy. Also, I have never had an appropriately cooked order of fries. Pretty disappointing because they have so much potential if they were cooked well. 

I also find the service and atmosphere to be a bit lacking. I always feel like I'm inconveniencing the staff by giving them my business, never fun. The staff always has their phone out and it feels like a buddy hangout more than team members providing customer service."}
{"text":"The only thing that holds this review from being five star is not enough salt.  Really good otherwise.

Hawaii guy in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall for sure. Nothing special from the outside. The inside is very chill. The best thing about this place was the man working behind the counter, he was nice and had a sense of humor. You can just tell when someone is enjoying what they do and cards about making the costumer happy. I had a pretty big appetite when I walked in this place and decided to try a few things the south philly & jalapeño chill cheese fries. Im a fan of both. The food was ready pretty quick to. looking forward to trying other things on the menu, they have a big selection. Also they have tea which I thought was pretty cool since I'm not a soda drinker. 2 thumbs up  Straight from Philly"}
{"text":"This place is great! We come here all the time. Owners are really good people and the food is amazing. Very consistent in every way."}
{"text":"This is fabulous!!!!!  Just left there and will have to say what a GREAT lunch!  I agree that these are the best cheesesteaks in Las Vegas.

I had the lunch special, and thought, \"it can't be this cheap\".  Cheap as in inexpensive.  The cheesesteak and fries should have cost $10++.  SCORE!

Both the meat and the rolls come from Philly and the lunch was HOT!!!! Fries were perfectly crispy.  

I was asked if I had any questions at the end of our lunch and the only question I had was \"Why isn't there a line out the door?\"  Fabulous! 

Run don't walk and what to know what else?  They deliver!

No more standing outside in the heat next to a crazy intersection waiting to get a cheesesteak.  We're home! 
Thank you for being here!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and always good. Pretty quick service even with a big group. Friendly staff and delicious food."}
{"text":"Tried this place because of good Yelp reviews,  and I was pleasantly surprised! Great Philly sub & perfect onion rings! Give this place a try! I'm sure you'll like it!! Friendly staff too! db"}
{"text":"MmmMmmm!! Just had the best Philly cheesesteak ever!! I had the Parmesan cheese steak and my son had the Bell Pepper Cheesesteak, both were ridiculously good... Great staff!"}
{"text":"This was by far the best Cheesesteak I've ever had. I worked at Capriotti's for over a year and have been to many restaurants and sandwich shops that have great cheesesteak. However; this place takes the cake. Went with my boyfriend and his buddy and we were all very impressed. Definitely found my new go to sand which shop. 
 The bread was  baked perfectly and they are very generous with their portions too. Their fries are amazing,  just discovered you can get cheese in them, I strongly recommend. I will be returning in the near future and will probably become a regular there."}
{"text":"Was looking for an authentic cheese steaks on a trip to Henderson. I'd give 4 stars for food but 2 for service. All 4 employees were on a phone or laptop by the front counter. My daughter asked if all the people were on the phone who's cooking our order? Good question. 25 min wait when I'm only customer.food was good but with the amount of options, I'll find a different place for my cheese steak fix."}
{"text":"The food was yummy.  Prices a little more than expected but really good food."}
{"text":"OMG! Big, delicious sandwiches! Couldn't finish it all, took it home for lunch next day. I had the Philly with mushrooms and grilled onions. A real live hole in the wall, but so worth it. Clean and service was excellent!"}
{"text":"It been while since had me some Cheez Wiz or Philly Cheesesteak. Cheez Wiz is the ultimate taste test for any true Philly Cheesesteak. Well if there is no Cheez Wiz then shame on that establishment cause that just offense. Not that am from Philly but knowing friends from Philly and the east coast. ALL about the CHEEZ WIZ. I feel like Straight From Philly does fabulous job of bringing some of that Philly Cheez Wiz to Vegas. I just wish asked for double the order (Thanks for fellow yelper Chris V for the tip). I ordered one of the speciality Cheesesteak the \"Broad Street Bully\". It has your mushrooms and onions (was optional) another two classic toppings make cheesesteak. Fan of banana peppers and jalapeño or spicy foods. You combine the kick of the peppers, with some Cheez Whiz, and then the steak really nice balance. The steak you get nice huge ass portion. It literally impossible to hold half the cheesesteak in your hand without all the goodness of the filling coming out with every bite! Great thing my friend. My only thing that could have been better with the cheesesteak is the bread. Not that it was bad just felt like lacking nice outside crunch or the crust was not feeling it. The fries just got your normal side fries was exactly that just normal. They do offer few different sides of fries more exotic that I should have tried but will get that in next visit. 

The owners were awesome. I have always always been fan of small family run businesses not major chain or trendy ones. I feel like here at Straight From Philly you get that sense in the food. Personal touch in the food. The service friendly, personable, checked make sure everything was great, explain everything since was my first time, and easy talk stories with almost feels like your part of the family when you walk in. Talk about by far one of the BEST decor seen in while that needs shout out. Most might think am crazy?! As a wrestling fan going back old old school WWF or current TNA. They have bunch of signed 8x10 pictures of wrestlers going back old old school to couple current ones. It all bunched up nice in a picture frame (three of them). It brought back found memories. If anything got me excited looking at the names and signatures all fired up to eat. The restaurant looks like ice cream parlor turned into restaurant. It really only two pieces of equipment that can clearly see in the open kitchen concept. I do appreciate the fact not about excess but having the right equipment for really straight forward menu Cheesesteak, Sandwiches, Burgers, and not surprised since looks like ice cream parlor they serve ice cream.

I would definitely come back again but if am closer to Pops sorry say Straight From Philly would be my second option. Still overall both options get solid Cheesesteak with some classic Cheez Whiz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a huge fan of cheese steaks, if it is on the menu he is almost guaranteed to order it. Typically we go to Cappriottis when he has a craving, not anymore. This place was delicious!!!! He and I split a jalapeno cheesesteak and added mushrooms and the atomic cheese fries. Holy moly it was all amazing. Definitely out new spot!!!"}
{"text":"I used the Yelp app to find me a delicious cheesesteak and it did not disappoint. Straight From Philly was not too far, so I decided to go grab some grub to go. Once you drive into the parking lot, looks can be deceiving since it is on the corner of an old shopping center but inside the restaurant was clean and the service was great.

Since it was my first time here, I just sort of stared at the menu. I am also not too familiar with the cheesesteak world, so I really didn't know what I was ordering. I decided on 2 cheesesteaks, 2 fries and 2 drinks. This came to about $25-- which was a little much for sandwiches for dinner, but hey whatever. You can customize your cheesesteaks (even with the deal) so I choose the garlic parm cheesesteak and a mushroom cheesesteak. As I waited for our order, the girl who took our order came over to offer refills. She even asked on our way out, to make sure that our cups were full for the drive home. I really appreciate the little things like that. 

By the time I got home, the cheesesteaks were extra greasy. The paper bag that it was in was pretty much see thru by now. I will admit, thats not really all that appetizing but I guess that is typical for cheesesteaks? Like I said, I am no cheesesteak expert. The sandwich was huge and I was only able to eat about 1/3 of it before I was tired of it. I would recommend that you share with someone. I did kill my order of fries though-- but thats just typical Erin N. right there. Don't leave your fries around, I will eat ALL of them without even taking your feelings into consideration.

Overall, I enjoyed the cheesesteaks & the fries! The service was awesome. I will be back again to try out their daily specials."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp...i am a foodie! I am from the Bay Area and would much rather spend my money on good food than loosing it too a machine! First off easy to find, and when you walk in very clean and I was immediately greeted and with a smile by all 3 staff members! Which kinda threw me off because haven't really got that too much out here...staff entire time soooo nice, and pleasant atmosphere to boot! Now I'm gonna be honest I did not expect at all for this young guy to walk back and be cooking my food!!!! As a chef I didn't go to school until my twenties sooo I was a bit Leary! Tried all their cool little hot sauces too! Got the cheesesteak and chili cheese fries to go! And let me tell ya OHMYGAWD!!! AMAZING!! Soooo good!!! All the way around this place is a must go and heck yeeeaaassss I will def be back!

11-6-16 
Aaaaeeeeeyyyy this is the DREAM TEAM RIGHT HERE!!! Sunday crew had me sooo right!!! Customer Service was  they are always soooo nice & food is the bomb!!! Best Philly ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really good Philly cheesesteak sandwiches, the meat was really flavorable (is that  a word LOL). I had the sweet pepper cheesesteak w/provolone and fried onions, very yummy. French fries were seasoned goods and the place was clean. I'm going back for sure."}
{"text":"If someone hadn't told me about this place I would have never even seen it.  It's nothing to look at but they do make great cheesesteak sandwiches and those are hard to find in Henderson.  I thought it was a little pricey until I saw the sandwich.  It's huge and packed with meat."}
{"text":"Delicious cheesesteak.  5/5.  We are from Allentown, close to Philly.  Loved the food.  Garlic parm fries are amazing as well.  Hope they stay in business, not too busy when we were there.  Hard to see from the main street.  Will be back.  Have already sent a few friends there from the east coast who have loved it."}
{"text":"Always the best food. This is the only place I'll go for a philly even if I live 30 mins away. Well worth it. 
The staff is always nice and super friendly, the environment is super laid back and is just super welcoming."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the cheese fries and steak and cheese!!  Just hsd the chilli cheese burgers and they were so good. Thanks for makinh them.( not in the menu anymore). I do really recommend to go eat there."}
{"text":"Best philly place in Vegas!!! Fantastic customer service and they're open pretty late for great food!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious! I ordered the South Philly and garlic - parm fries. I took it all home and it was wonderful. The meat was juicy, not fatty, and plentiful. The fries were crispy and hot. All with great flavor. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just ordered for these guys and everything was great me my wife and our baby loved it"}
{"text":"After passing this place many times I finally yelped it. The reviews were really favorable so we thought we'd give it a try. We were not disappointed! The cheesesteak sandwiches were great and the garlic parmesan fries were the best garlic fries we ever had. They will customize your sandwiches any way you want and the staff there is extremely friendly. Word of mouth goes a long way and this place has earned it."}
{"text":"Have been there several times and have not been disappointed yet.  Try the Atomic Buffalo Cheese Fries."}
{"text":"My husband recently discovered this little gem and suggested we have lunch here today. One word. AMAZING!!!! IF YOU DON'T TRY IT, YOU'RE MISSING OUT!"}
{"text":"Happy new year everybody! Starting off the new year with my 1st new place and so glad I did! Straight from philly!!! Right in the heart of Hendertukey on the corner of lake mead & water st. I've had the philly blues since hanks closed and even though some people say pop's is the best. And while they are good, they are not the best. I can now say I have a new home for cheesesteaks. Had me making yummy noises from the first bite to the last. Nice and hearty portion with that perfect soft bread. This will definitely be a new staple for the coming year and a long time to come."}
{"text":"Fast and delicious food. My gf is a philly steak guru so I was looking for a new spot and boy did we find it!"}
{"text":"Never been to Philly but I've had Philly cheesesteaks all over. This is hands down the best. Great size, large amount of meat, awesome flavor. Family owned so support local business."}
{"text":"I have been looking for an alternative to Pops Philly cheesesteaks. There were a few on Silverado Ranch area, but they both closed down. But I'm glad I stumbled into this place.

I had the Philly cheesesteak with buffalo sauce. Some places don't do that which is a damn shame. Add that with a side of bacon cheese fries. The cheesesteaks came out on a hoagie roll and stuffed with meat. Meat was tender and delicious. The bacon cheese fries was a delight. Cheese was good, they used real bacon but the fries were unique. It was well seasoned and crispy. Almost like seasoned fries from Rallys.

Will return again!"}
{"text":"Ok, maybe I am crazy to give 5 stars after one visit. But this cheesesteak, was just that good. I was leaving my favorite local Mexican place in the same lot, with a car full of aromas of tacos and enchiladas, and all of a sudden out of the corner of my eye I see, \"CHEESESTEAKS NOW OPEN\". 
Ask my daughter, I slammed on my breaks and we almost stopped that very second!
Little did I know, that was their first night open. I went the next day about 11:00 AM. 
They are promoting free ice cream. Not sure if that is an all the time thing, or something to bring business. But let's just say the 17 year old did not at all mind his cone while we waited for the real food. 
Between the family, we ordered a variety of Cheesesteaks, a burger, and cheese fries. Let's just say, there were no leftovers and 2 of the 4 family members wanted to return the next day.  
This place is a hidden gem!! DO NOT keep going when you can't find it the first time, when I say hidden, I mean it. The family is really from Philly, they even have some fun facts to read while you wait. 
You're welcome, because yes, you will be thanking me."}
{"text":"The place looks like a fast food restaurant. However it wad clean. There were 5 of us eating. Owner took orders from the counter rather than coming to our table. The food was amazing. Philly cheese steak sandwiches were delicious. The philly cheese steak fries were huge. All in all it was a good experience. Would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Always on a quest to find good philly cheese steak. Saw this place randomly on yelp and didn't realize I pass it everyday. Customer service was very friendly and attentive. Had a good sized philly cheese steak (with Whiz) Don't knock it till you tried it. Bread was good just wish it was warm, for some reason it was cold. But the Steak and whiz were hot and delicious. I would say this place ranks in my top 3 philly stops in Henderson."}
{"text":"Fantastic Cheesesteaks and fries!  Stopped here after a soccer game, glad we have soccer again tomorrow as we will probably stop by again!"}
{"text":"This place out did both Geno's and Pat's!!!!  Philly sub with provolone was to die for!!!!  They know what they're doing!!!!  Will go back ASAP!"}
{"text":"Amazing yum, the best PhillyCheese Steak ever! 
The different hot sauce choices are amazing!
Great perfectly cooked fries, different peppers, my belly is so content!
Can't wait to tasted the western bacon burger!"}
{"text":"As my teeth sunk into the cheesesteak and I tasted my first bite, tears started to run down my face. The cheesesteaks not only reminded me of vacations on the Philly streets, but the taste is something I've longed for and looked for in Vegas for many years. 

The location is right next to a motel and laundry mat and just its tucked in right off of Lake Mead. This is truly a diamond in the rough as you will have to be actively searching for this place if you want to taste this Philadelphia masterpiece. 

Food: 5 stars plus! This is a Philly cheesesteak. The bread, the meat, the juices everything is as near as you could get on the cart outside of Independence Hall. The portions are a healthy size and will fill you up! 

Price: a cheesesteak is under $10 and lunch specials are less than $7. For about $12-14 you can have a great meal that will fill you up. 

Atmosphere: Philadelphia memorabilia is all over with the Rocky Balboa statue and pictures of Pats and Genos. If you're a Cowboys or Giants fan you will not be a fan, but me as an Eagles fan loves this place. 

Customer service: the lady who took our order was so sweet and patient. She was fast and helpful. The food was out about 5 min after we ordered. 

Great experience and I will take the 30 min drive to be back!"}
{"text":"Went back again to get another Cheesesteak....it was pretty darn good.  Unfortunately this place still has no phone....so can't order ahead.  They claim to have AC....but the last 2 times we were here their thermostat read 87 degrees!  Too hot inside for a restaurant!!!!  They had 3 or 4 big fans blowing which was annoying!  But what was worse...they had plug-in air fresheners behind the fan...and it was so horrible smelling!!!!  I've never been to a restaurant that plugged in air fresheners!  It was pretty gross to smell that while your eating.  It actually gave me a headache!  I assume the owner is extremely cheap....because they will not kick down that AC!  It was 109 out today....and fans blowing on you when you eat is unacceptable in this heat.  But the cheesesteak was good....so I had to suffer the smell, heat & blowing air! :P"}
{"text":"The sandwiches were not bad at all, but nothing more than what I would expect from a mall food court.  Every mall in America has a cheese steak place.  That being said, this place is EXPENSIVE!  Four sandwiches and four drinks were $54.  We didn't even get fries.   For that kind of money there is a laundry list of other places I'd rather go."}
{"text":"Cheesesteaks deliver but the garlic Parmesan fries are worth of me writing this review a must get!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches were AMAZING and ginormous and they custom make every order - no heat lamps at this joint. Top it off with the juiciness and the amazing combo of meat and melted cheese and this is a Philly worth driving for. If you want a great Philly, come check this place out. The price is good too.

The only \"issue\" with this place is that it's in a bit of a gritty neighborhood, but that has nothing to do with the quality or flavor of the food."}
{"text":"I've never been to this location as my husband always picks up our to go order. The Buffalo fries are amazing and the gyros are excellent. Highly recommend eating here if you're craving a gyro. My husband says he enjoys going in as the staff are friendly and he likes the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow excellent cheesesteaks!  My first time there was so good that I went back 3 days in a row. Now I'm sick of cheesesteaks but I'll be back for sure when the mood hits again lol. I ordered the regular steak and cheese one with cheese wiz and grilled onions. Was finger licking delicious."}
{"text":"2nd visit and same great service and piping hot food. My wife and I each had the lunch special of a half Philly Cheese Steak.  The french fries were spiced up and crunchy and hot...perfect.  Service was friendly and quick (5 minute wait with no one in line ahead of us).   We walked out $15 lighter...great value.  I'll be back for a 3rd visit.  Love this local Henderson restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came in here today with my parent's and we all got the lunch specail. Still very good. The girl at the front was nice and orders didn't take that long to come out. The bread, cheese and meat is really good. The american cheese is where it's at. Fries are nice and crispy too"}
{"text":"While on vacation at lake Las Vegas we saw this place several times driving. This being our third trip in a years time I looked it up on Yelp and saw some pics. I was sold.  I went down there tonight after checking in to my hotel and getting settled. Please was clean and the staff was very nice. Menu was simple, the way it should be. As far as the food. BEST CHEESESTEAK I HAVE EVER EATEN.   My kids (2&5) had a cheeseburger. And my wife had a gyro. I personally love the gyro as does she and she said it might be the best she has ever had. Couldn't recommend enough. Well done"}
{"text":"Check your order before leaving!!! My husband just got home....order totally wrong....ordered EXTRA sauce, got NO sauce on the steak. Mayo slathered on an Italian sub (it's some white sauce not usually there)??  Didn't order that. Ordered another steak with sauce, got no sauce. Ordered no onions, looks like EXTRA onions on both. Obviously someone else's order. Already home and throwing it out. Bummer. Check your order before leaving! Normally it's correct and awesome, very strange!! :("}
{"text":"We eat here all the time. Every time we come it is yummy. The owner is a real cool guy and the staff is always friendly and food is good. This place is the best."}
{"text":"I am so happy that me and my roommate found this place. At first we were hesitant to go because the appearance is not at all what to would expect, but do not judge a book by its cover! Their menu is so big and everything we have tried there has been really good. The sweet pepper cheesesteak is our favorite! Definitely recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"I came here bc a friend of mine said I would not be disappointed and he was right!! 
I ordered a garlic chz stk and philly fries and these 2 items were on POINT!! Must try is the philly chz fries... if you are accustomed to the ooowee goooeeyy molten cheez whiz and to top it off a generous amount of chopped ribeye, this is the place you need to go to. Would be a 5 star but I went there on a 108 degree day and it felt like that inside the restaurant too.  I plan on going back to try more items.  Check it out.... you might like it!!"}
{"text":"Randomly found this place and after looking at the reviews decided to give it a whirl as my roommate and I have been looking for a good Philly cheesesteak.  I have to say this place did not disappoint!  The food was GREAT!

I ordered the South Philly and it was on point.  The meat was well cooked and juicy. The peppers where cooked well and still had a bit of crisp to them.  The onions were nicely caramelized and the cheese whiz was well spread out through the sandwich.  The bread was toasted and helped to absorb all the great juice from the meat. 

The guy working the grill seemed very friendly and nice and welcomed us as we walked in.  The place is very simple in look and very clean.  From the outside you could miss it at night as they only have a white banner out front. But it is worth it to take another look if you pass it by the first time. 

Overall I was very happy with this place and even more excited that they deliver.  The food was good and came out fast.  I wanted to give it 5 stars but they only thing that kept me from that is the women who took our order and delivered the food to the table. Not sure if she was having a bad night but she seemed very bothered to take our order. Despite that I will be telling friends to check this place out and I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Legit Philly Cheesesteak in Henderson, NV! It has been 10 years since I have had a true Philly Cheesesteak but do remember that the tastes as if it was yesterday. Yes, been to Geno's and Pat's but those are not the best that Philly has...  In any case, the Cheesesteaks here are pretty amazing and I look forward to returning.  Super fortunate that this is near where I live."}
{"text":"Great sandwich. I am raving about this place. Love the name and the product! Best sandwich I've had in years. Definitely going back soon! This is a must try."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Good is great! Great atmosphere. You definitely get plenty of food for your money."}
{"text":"My friend eats here Often. After He brought me dinner from here this week I  will be back I love it..  Thanks Marcus"}
{"text":"This place has Amazing Philly cheesesteaks and so many different things to choose from and everyone that works here is so extremely nice and helpful this place is truly a great find!"}
{"text":"So hard to find good food!!! But we found it!! Secret little place hidden off Stephanie !!"}
{"text":"10/5 stars! This place has BY FAR the best philly's in Vegas! HANDS DOWN!!! NOT EVEN CLOSE!!! If you like philly's, you HAVE to try this place! Staff is average, but the food MORE than makes up for it. I will never have a Philly from anywhere else again. This place is it!"}
{"text":"Great cheese steak. Seasoned well. Loving the crispy fries! The gyro had nice fresh vegetables, a fresh pita, and authentic, properly seasoned lamb. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese steak hoagie with mayo,ketchup, peppers and onions, a cheese steak with ketchup and onion, a side of onion rings and chicken tenders. Everything was delicious. The portions were generous and the price reasonable.
 
Being from South Jersey a cheese steak has become a staple in our diet and we've been on the hunt for the authentic Philly flavors.  We need look any further. This place is the real deal with its shreaded steak, fresh rolls and a greasy paper bag !

The fries were thick which my kids prefer and seasoned perfectly. The cheese was spread over the fries not given on the side in a cup. The chicken tenders filled my two little ones and also came with a side of fries.

I will definitely be back and highly recommend anyone looking for an authentic Philly cheese steak to drop in."}
{"text":"This place was Straight Out .We were skeptical but decide to try it after reading another Yelp review. The signage was really hard to spot, but we were motivated ! It's across the street from the DMV in a small shopping center.

We ordered a cheese steak sub with fried onions, ketchup, mayo and hot peppers, which we decided to share. The rolls imported from Philly we were told was soft and fresh. The meat was thin and seasoned well very juicy and tender. They packed the sandwich with meat and toppings the onions peppers and tomatoes were grilled to perfection. My husband complained he could barely taste the cheese though. Maybe next time I'll order extra cheese. The size was perfect we shared a sandwich and I and my hubby are full. Nice bang for your buck and very worth every dollar spent.

As it was Friday we received a free order of fries. They were fries and edible I would like to try the loaded fries though.

The service and customer service was great. The shop was clean and felt like I was in a Philly sub shop. They should offer more Philly favorites though. Tasty Cakes are a Philly must have, Italian Water Ice  and Root beer would solidify that authentic Philly feel !

I will definitely be back to try more steaks and hoagies."}
{"text":"Wow! Best Philly cheesesteak! Gotta come back for more! Very friendly people who work there."}
{"text":"Service was great very welcoming, had an affordable lunch here. Came for the Philly steak it was really good  definitely will be back to try more"}
{"text":"Really delicious cheesesteak (I had one with just mushrooms and extra cheese). It was piping hot, juicy and hit the spot. Loved it.  Could only have been improved with a grilled or toasted roll. 
Dinged 2 stars because the vibe was kind of negative/adversarial/strange/not-welcoming. I get that probably every 3rd person who walks in there probably says \"Hey guess what? I'm from the East Coast too!\" and they get sick of it. But even faking that you care, or making a friendly comment or two about Philly or DC or NY would go a long way in terms of feeling like you care I'm there--beyond the $10 for the sandwich.  It would definitely make me feel more at home in this locale and I would make it a point to come back frequently.  
Initially, the young man who greeted me (seems to be a family) was very helpful and encouraged me to ask any questions about the menu. He said basically they can make you a Philly whatever way you want, Awesome!  I asked him to describe the French Fries, and when he didn't know what I meant, I asked whether he could maybe show me what even 1 fry looks like.. He said, no, he couldn't.  Not a big deal, but sort of funny. 
The man who runs the place then came over and gave me a description of the fries. They''re the kind that have that coating on the outside---not what fries are like in Philly and I'm not fond of french fries with a coating. He tried to convince me to order them, even tho I said I know many places in the Vegas area have coated fries, but I do not like them. \"Well, why not give them a try!\" It was weird. I don't know how else to convey I truly don't fries coated in batter.
The young man then told the woman (maybe his mom) who was cooking at the grill something, looking over his shoulder as he did so, and she exclaimed: \"Oh HELL no!!! She did NOT just say that!! You are NOT telling me that?!!\" The adult man was also laughing, and saying to her, \"Oh, come now--don't you give it one more thought, it's no thing!\" etc. But they all started derisively yucking it up and adding more jokes. Maybe they weren't talking about me---at all---but I was the only woman in the shop.  
And behaving that way, when there are customers in your restaurant, regardless of who you're talking about, doesn't spread a very happy positive vibe.
Regardless, a great sandwich. I drove 7 miles for it. If they were friendlier and didn't kind of act like I was an interloper or nuisance, I would be back 1-2x/week.  Still, I will make it a point to swing by every now and again--it was that flavorful, juicy, so-yummy, and fun to patronize a unique local small business, even if they didn't seem to appreciate it very much :)"}
{"text":"Came here after 6 hours at the Westin pool. We were immediately created by the friendliest guy ever and 2 other friendly employees. They told us what their favorites were so we of course ordered them. While we waited the employees hatted and joked with us like we were long time friends. Food came quick which was another plus since we were starving. Seriously the bomb!!!! Wish we had this place in Cali! Service  and food top notch!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food here. I got a philly sandwich and fries came with it that day for free. The fries were ok. Loved that there was plenty of cheese whiz on my sandwich and it was tasty."}
{"text":"Wit of witout? That is the question...

Straight From Philly is located in Henderson, on Stephanie just north of American Pacific. They're inside the same complex as Henry's, Fausto's, Nevada State High School, etc. Our visit was around 8pm on a Friday night and we had a little bit of hard time finding the place. Mostly because they only have a banner up at the moment, and at night it can be easy to drive right by the kind of dimly lit corner they're in. But once you find it, you're in for a treat.

Having never been to Philly myself, I can only attest my knowledge of cheesesteaks to eating a lot of them at all sorts of different places. And for the most part, I've always found Capriotti's to be one of the better ones in Vegas, especially when taking into consideration that it's a chain. So, when I came into SFP and found out these guys are really from Philly, I asked what's the original or authentic way to have one. He explained that it all varies by regions, that there's no real \"authentic\" way and obviously hugely varies by preference. Their menu alone offers nearly a dozen different styles, or you customize one to your liking. And for those who don't want a cheesesteak, they offer burgers, hoagies, gyros and a few other things as well.

I ended up going with the South Philly which has mushrooms, bell peppers and whiz. They offered grilled onions too, and of course I couldn't turn that down. Priced at just a tad over $9, this is a huge sandwich packed with tons of meat and huge flavor! The meat is shaved down to nice thin pieces, it was tender and not overly greasy like you'll find at a lot of places. I was also surprised to get some flavor from the meat itself too. Again, I'm not from Philly or anywhere near it, but too many cheesesteaks fall way short on the meat and rely heavily on toppings for flavor. But here at SFP, you're getting it across the board. Crisp fresh veggies, lightly grilled onions and of course, the whiz. I'm a fan of cheese whiz in general, I like the gooeyness and strong flavors, and they put plenty of it on there. Pack that all into a nice soft, chewy roll and all I've got to say is move over Capriotti's...there's a new cheesesteak in town. One of the top, if you ask me.

Since it was Fryday Friday (free fries with purchase of a sandwich and drink), we also got a order of regular fries and a separate order of the atomic fries as well. I wasn't really a fan of either. They seem to use those frozen, breaded type fries and there just really wasn't anything special about them. I like that they top the atomic fries with whiz, but the hot sauce they use had a really sweet flavor to me that kind of just threw it all off. I'd suggest leaving them off your order and sticking with just a sandwich. With as big as they are, they'll satisfy most appetites anyway.

All in all, this is a sold 4 star joint. We came in late and weren't offered the ice cream, but that wasn't really a huge deal. I liked the service, the place was clean, and for the portion and quality you're getting, the price really isn't bad at all. Even though I live exactly 30 miles from this place, I'll be sure to return for more!"}
{"text":"The quick and dirty review:

Food: 5/5
Establishment: 4/5
Cleanliness: 4/5

Now for the in depth review:

I've been wanting to visit Straight From Philly after discovering the restaurant on Yelp. I went ahead and took my family for dinner here tonight. We ordered our food to go.

It took a second to get acknowledged since there was one person on the grill, another on the phone, and another busy with something else. We got our order in easily and quickly, no complaints there.

The wait was about 10 minutes for 3 cheesesteaks and 3 orders of fries. During this time I sat down and looked over the place; you can tell they are still very new and don't have their process streamlined yet, but this is did not retract from my experience. The place was clean enough but our table had crumbs on it and the ketchup bottle was almost empty. The floors could use a deep clean and regular mopping. It is small inside, and each table can only really sit 4 people. I would estimate the max capacity for this restaurant would be around 35-40 people.

There was a woman inside with a baby/toddler, and she seemed to be with the employees there at the time. That didn't bother me, however the baby toy at the front counter did. A baby toy behind the front counter where food is wrapped and prepped is not a sign of hygiene. -1 star here.

The food was excellent. The cheesesteaks were big, juicy, and everything (including the veggies) tasted fresh. We ordered cheese fries, and we were given a generous amount with an equally generous amount of melted cheddar. These cheesesteaks are several notches above anything I have had here in Vegas/Henderson and I will come back for them, but I will skip the fries (too much food). 

My overall experience was very good and I was left very impressed with the food. I would like to visit this place again and hope they fix the minor issues that would bring this place up to local legend status. It's that good."}
{"text":"Never had a good Philly cheesesteak place in Henderson but this place is pretty good. I like the cheesesteak lunch special with fries because the fries are crispy and good."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall joint has got the best hot sandwiches in henderson. I have eaten here for lunch two days straight and I have had the chicken bomb and the Hawaiian chicken sandwich with the garlic parm gries. Def get the garlic parm fries they are the bomb digidy. I also love the array of hot sauces that was placed on the tables like peachy habnero, subtle louisiana, and hellfire sauce. Makes lunch a little pricey but you get a major taste return on investment here rather than over a franchise subsandwich resturant where it's same old same old. Give this place a try and don't be off put by the laundry mat or hourly pay motel next door to it!!!"}
{"text":"The best cheesesteak I've EVER had. Been here multiple times. Great fries too, and free ice cream (for now). Try The Texan, my fave so far. Closed Sundays, which makes me sad. Not a franchise, and the owner is actually from Philly!"}
{"text":"amazing food!! I've tried genos steaks in philly, it's ehh, this place is 100% better and we are not even in philly!! deff adding this locations to regular places to eat here in vegas!!"}
{"text":"I literally cannot get enough of these Phillies! The atmosphere inside the restaurant is very homey and fun! The food is unbelievable and the staff is so helpful and nice!"}
{"text":"Chessesteak was ok. A little bit too oily and seems the mushroom and onions were pre-cooked and were ready made. Not made to order from scratch.  I'm from the East Coast and I've  been to Pat's or Geno's, so it's hard to imagine quality chessesteak outside Philly.

Also the sandwich was dripping and splatter on my pants. Not good."}
{"text":"Hands down best cheese steaks around! So good. And its never a long wait! Way better than capriottis and better priced also!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place. My family is from South Philly and they say it is the closest to the REAL thing you can get in this area. Bread is delivered from Philly daily. Great value and truly yummy."}
{"text":"SOOOO GOOD!! Me and the bf stumbled upon this place while being on a two hour wait for the barbershop up the street. We found a hidden gem!! 
Love love loveeee the food here
Very heart-warming, mouthwatering cheesesteaks. 
10 stars if I could give them 10 stars."}
{"text":"Driving through and stopped here to eat. Clean and nice people. Small dining room. Food was really good. We would go there again. I got the south philly husband got New York Philly he liked mine more than his but said it was yummy and we got Philly fries. Way to much food so we have plenty left for later. Kids got hamburgers and they said they were really good."}
{"text":"This was the worst thing I have ever eaten. Soggy nasty flavorless bread, dry flavorless meat, what were CLEARLY canned mushrooms and raw peppers it was definitely not worth it at all I threw mine away and ordered elsewhere what a waste of money!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to write a review and I think this is a funny story. 

I used to go here like once a week and then a couple things happened and now I haven't been back for a long time and doubt I'll be back again. Like any business should know, 75-85% of your unhappy customers won't complain or write bad reviews, they just won't return. That's where I WAS going to fall into, until...

Well this place came up when I was yelping something else and I saw a bad review, decided to read more. Saw the owners horrible responses. Saw a couple incidents that were exactly like what happened to me. Made me take the time to write a review since the owner feels like people are just making things up. 

So first, while I was visiting regularly I noticed they were advertising for the NRA (free bumper stickers on the counter) which I found odd since I'm pretty sure it's a minority family owned business, but hey whatever floats your boat. I personally think it's pretty stupid for a small business to get involved in politics, but not my wallet that's getting hurt by it. This wasn't going to change whether I visited or not. Just found it odd/comical.

Then a couple weeks later. The hair incident. Found hair in my cheese steak and yes just like the other people who complained. The people cooking are not wearing hair nets and some of them have long hair. Look, it happens, but it's extremely unappetizing and really turns people off. Like I said earlier, I was just going to be one of those customers who was unhappy and never returned. But since your responses to other peoples reviews are pretty terrible and you seem to enjoy collecting your 1 stars. Here you go. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Really fresh Philly cheesesteaks that we ordered to go! They were so fresh that is just like they came off the grill when opened at home! The buns didn't sog up at all !  Customer service was great, wish we all tried the different options they had for French fries but didn't notice them until after the fact. It was $45 for 4 subs and fries. Subs were huge and even cut to share. I think that was a bit pricey but definitely makes up for it in taste. I'm taking a star for space available to eat in and cleanliness look. If you don't care about those things then definitely come try, I don't care enough about those last two things to stop me from going back! I'll b there anytime I stop on water street!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place one before where my cheesesteak was delicious and thinly sliced.  I went back today to pick up lunch for my wife and I. So I picked up the steaks and drove to my wives work (20 min away) when we opened our steaks  we were so disappointed to find that our meat was the consistency of a burger patty. I do not remember this being the case the first time I was their as I am very particular with my cheesesteak. I contacted the place and was told that their meat is never sliced thin and comes in chunks and they cut it up on the cook top. I was under the imprecision that a cheesesteak is thinly sliced? Well lesson learned l. I don't know if they changed their meat or what but I was offered two free steaks on my next visit which I will not be redeeming. 

So If you are looking for a thinly sliced steak this is not the place to go. I will not be returning to this place and still dispute the fact that their meat was always that thick."}
{"text":"I had high expectations from this place after reading the reviews....but I have to disagree with their 4 stars for sure.  There was also some serious word-of-mouth raving about this place.  
My husband ordered the gyro.  Turns out it was frozen, processed, lamb.  Seriously???  Gross.
I ordered the philly with onions.  It was meh...It wasn't awful, but it wasn't outstanding.  I've had better at the Great Steak and potato company in the mall.  The fries were greasy- and overall, it wasn't some place I was impressed with.  The prices were decent, but  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"They do what they say they do!

Cheesesteaks:  Rolls directly from Philly. Meat great. All the right options. 

Cheeseburger:  Outstanding!  Perfect ratio of meat to toppings to bun. Great char from the grill and a $5.95 lunch special with fries to boot!

Fries:  Double fried and properly seasoned. 

Great food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I'm no expert on cheesesteaks, but whatever I had it tasted good. The owners are (obviously?) from philly and seem to know cheesesteaks, so I'll have to trust in them what a good one tastes like. The meat was flavorful, but I didn't taste much of the cheese personally. I definitely enjoyed the peppers which brought a little spice to the sandwich.

The sandwich is large enough to be shared among two people, and their fries have a tasty spice seasoning on them, though I wish there was a little more. I think the only thing I might say is the menu needs some streamlining, and the price to make it a combo was a little bit steep (~3.50), though the sandwich price (~$10) was good."}
{"text":"wow. the phone girl is the rudest employee I've ever come across. refused to let me speak to a manager or anyone but her actually.
been here a few times and love the food but this time I ordered delivery.
one hour and thirty five minutes later my sandwich is not here. I called after an hour and she told me it was en route. 
too bad that was clearly a lie.
her attitude was so awful I'm going to call every day til I get the owner so i can ask him to perhaps retrain her with customer service in mind this time."}
{"text":"Came here after yelp reviews it was delicious and the price was good i just wished it would of came with more cheese on my Philly. Will be back"}
{"text":"I have been back a few times since my last review and the food is STILL great...and the service is improved..."}
{"text":"Let me just say that moving from the east coast and seeing a sign that says Straight from Philly got me real excited but that excitement quickly ran out with the terrible customer service and under cooked and lack of flavor gyro meat that barely looked edible. I did also order a cheesesteak to try everything on the menu. But I was blown away by how poorly the meat for the gyro was cooked and presented. The meat looked raw, even though the teenagers cooking and running the front said that it hit the grill top. I couldn't get over the gelatin type texture. I asked the counter girl to please let me switch the order was told that I would have to buy a new item and couldn't replace the item that I had already brought. Her attitude was rude and unapologetic for the way the food was presented. The attitude that was displayed by the teenagers that were left in charge was disgraceful. I was not treated how a customer should be treated especially where I am paying my money for a service."}
{"text":"Delicious. Hit the spot for sure. 
We got the hoagies and parm fries. 
We will be eating there again."}
{"text":"Good night, game over! These are the best Phillys in town!! They are amazing! The meat, the cheese, the bread! Everything was so delicious! I got a Philly with provolone and green peppers. The cheese was so melty and the bread was so soft, it all just melted in my mouth with such big flavor. I also got some \"Atomic\" sauce in the side and sprinkled this on my Philly for quite the kick! This is their homemade secret hot sauce. The staff was so friendly and helpful. The young lady at the front explained the menu and the specials that they had going on. Very sweet! Thanks so much! Moral of the story: EAT HERE

The picture does no justice."}
{"text":"As an avid Cheesesteak lover, I've tried a lot from all over.  The best was in San Francisco.   Now, I find this little gem in Henderson, actually there were two locations and now only one.  I hit up this place at least once a week ordering my steak with mayo, mustard, ketchup and pickles and now extra cheese.  The fries are pretty good too. 

Also, tried the cheeseburger and was equally impressed by it.

As with any fast food place there are good days and bad days, but the good out-weigh the bad.   So, if you're a cheesesteak fan, please give it a try.  Call for the hours before you head down."}
{"text":"My first experience here was not bogged down by the service or the food. However it was one particular obnoxious customer that made me feel threaten. A man who sat across me was yelling at his phone and said some disturbing things. After he got off his phone, he proceeded to tell his friends sitting with him that he hates kids and teenagers, and that he would \"punch them in the face.\" Since I was across from him, I immediately stop eating, ask for a to go bag, and left. 

Now for the restaurant itself. It's fantastic! The cashier was so polite, patience, and helpful. I ordered the Cuban which was delicious and tasty."}
{"text":"First time and loved it!  Get the atomic fries! Bacon jalapeños and banana peppers! This place is easy to miss. It's right on the corner of Lake mead & water. The cashier is very nice."}
{"text":"Amazing food.   I love the cheesesteak north philly.  The Phillys are huge and price friendly."}
{"text":"Wowie!  Finally it's about time a truly great philly cheese steak came to hendertucky.  This place is delicious...fresh bread, savory meat and veggies, and the whiz was super tasty.  Please help keep this place afloat."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!  We ordered the garlic parmesan philly cheesesteak and the bacon cheesteak, and loved them both.  They definitely don't skimp on the meat, they are generous, and flavorful, and I will be back visiting here often.  Also, they have a lot of unique and different cheesesteak items that you might not find at other places, such as an Italian cheesteak that combines a philly with an Italian sandwich, or a pastrami cheesesteak, etc.  Give them your business, phone ahead if you know what you want already!"}
{"text":"Great food, great cheesesteaks, AMAZING customer service! Will definitely be back except this time i'm bringing my family. Can't keep something so amazing a secret."}
{"text":"Friday night is always hard on our family, end of the week and the fridge is running low, the wife doesn't get home until later. We usually eat out on Fridays. Treat ourselves to some bomb grub. I found the Cheese steaks on the maps. I read some reviews and was immediately sold after seeing some pictures. I ordered 2 9\" cheese steaks, 2 seasoned fries and 2 large drinks for the wife and myself, added up to 22. A combo order of 3 real and fresh chicken strips, seasoned fries and a small drink, and cheese whiz cups for everyone put the order at a little over 30$. The taste is amazing, food was fresh, staff was awesome. I'll go back. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"By far the best cheesesteak sw I've ever had. I've never had a genuine cheesesteak from Philly but I can only imagine that the cheesesteaks are just as good as they are here. Straight from Philly never disappoints. Fries are prefectly seasoned and crispy. Picture curly fries without the curls. The meat to bread ratio is perfect, bread has great texture, not too hard like cardboard or too soft that it can't hold the elements together. A little greasy but that's from the gooey cheese. Like the fresh prince of Bel-Air once said it's not an authentic Philadelphia cheesesteak if you don't see grease stains on the bag and mine definitely did."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good cheesesteak. One of the best I've had in town. Only problem is price. I won't be able to come here often cause it cost me $13 for a cheesesteak, fries and soda. I try to keep my work lunches under $10 and the cheesesteak was nearly that alone. 
Ill definitely be back cause it's that good.  I guess my cholesterol will be happier it won't be as often."}
{"text":"Ok let me start by saying the cheesesteaks were amazing on that alone I would have give a full 5 stars, but you can't just get a cup of water there, kinda upsetting, it was WAY too cold temperature wise I was freezing, and the music was just ghetto kinda sucks cause cheesesteaks are usually not very good to take as a to go item but once again the food itself was awesome"}
{"text":"This place is bomb, but I give them a 4/5 cause they need to bring back their Peach Habanero Sauce ASAP.  It changes lives."}
{"text":"My son and I ate there last weekish? Melt in our mouths delicious! We shared a philly with jalapeños and bacon, and chili cheese fries with bacon. Our philly was oozing with meat, cheese and the perfect amount of grease melting in our mouths! The thing that I was most impressed about was the service, friendly and called me out by my name when our food was ready. Startled when they did that because I never told them my name? They got it from my credit card. Very impressed."}
{"text":"The best part was the roll, and the fries were OK......
I was in the Stephanie St area at 2pm, and I was starving. I looked up good wings near me, and Straight from Philly was one of the places listed. I read a few reviews, and with an overall 4 star rating, it was worth a try.  Photos showed perfectly cooked steak, awesome sautéed onions, and a fat slather of yellow Wiz down the center. 
When I opened the door, the place looked clean and well maintained. A previous Yelper noticed they had been opened for some time, and still had they provided by Coke for free \"now Open, proudly serving Coke\" or something along those lines. Time for some pro signs, or is business not yet stable enough? The place was easy to find because again, a previous Yelper instructed everyone to head north when in the parking lot. He searched around for a while, as it is a decent sized strip mall. Two customers were at a table waiting for their food, and six well behaved high school Seniors ( not a profiler, they had Class of 2016 T Shirts on) were ordering sandwiches. At first. Thought \"crap, I missed walking right up by about 2 minutes\" but then, I figured at least the food would be fresh. I thought that after seeing a foil hotel pan with liquid in the bottom holding probably 2 lbs of pre cooked steak. Not a problem, per se, but I have no idea how long it had been sitting there. I also noticed that the only comfortable seating (a padded booth) was clearly being used as the managers desk, sporting an IPad, several piles of papers, and a fan. To be fair, the booth was just outside the kitchen door, but the rest of the seating was unpadded high back chairs that I found extremely uncomfortable. Again, no big deal as I was getting my order to go.

I ordered a Cheese Wit (cheese steak with grilled onions and Cheese Wiz),
A Coke, and an order of wings. \"We don't have Wings anymore\". OK, take  them off your online menu then. The cashier was very nice and pleasant. I told her the order was to go, gave her my name, and sat in an uncomfortable chair. There were a least 6 sandwiches ahead of me, so I filled my soda \"we are changing over to Pepsi, please excuse the flavors that are out\" ahh, I'm seeing a pattern. Of course Coke was out, so Root Beer was the choice. I couldn't see over the counter from my seat, so in about 10min (totally reasonable), the cashier called my name. I grabbed the brown paper bag, and the cashier told me that the sandwiches came with fries. Nice bonus, so I headed for the door. 
I opened the sandwich after I got back to the car, and was disappointed to see, burn spots all over the steak, no yellow Cheese Wiz, more like a smattering of white American or Provolone (Straight from Philly my Ass). I took my first bite, and found the roll to be soft and flavorful. The meat was Chewy and well overcooked, as well as being more than slightly over seasoned (very salty). The onions were hard and crunchy, nothing like you find at Pats in Philly ( I had eaten at least 100 authentic Cheese steaks, and this was low on the list. Capriottis (sadly, not very far from my location) blows this sandwich out of the water. Not even close. The sandwich I was eating was a solid D grade, Caps an A-. I tried the fries, they were surprisingly good. 

Overall, an awful eating experience, but now I know what questions to ask. I always give a bust a second chance, everyone can have a bad day. I'll go back at opening, or just after Lunch. If everything is not fresh then, there is a more serious problem. There seems to be a real,disconnect between the older reviews, and my experience. The cashier, the A county food service rating, and the roll (which is apparently straight from Philly) elevated from the quality one star, to an overall 2 star. 

I will return soon, and post an update."}
{"text":"Really good philly cheese steaks with many different options. I liked u could have american cheese, provolone or cheese whiz. Some people dont like the whiz but i like to have the option.

They also do burgers and gyros but i would stick to a philly.

I prob wont be back as its kinda far from me but if im ever in the area i would defiantly try again."}
{"text":"Probably the best cheesesteak you're going to get in town both in terms of flavor and pricing.

They have a ton of topping options and specialty cheesesteaks. I got mine with Genoa salami, grilled onion and cherry peppers. They also have a pickle bar with various peppers free of charge. Every sandwich joint needs this. Also a golden staple of sandwich places are squeezable food lubes. This place has some great, spicy and tangy sauces to add at your table.

Bread stayed in tact thoughout my entire onslaught of sauces and peppers. The fillings were still pipin hot even after finishing one half of the sandwich and a serving of wicked atomic cheese fries. That's gotta be some sort of Christmas miracle.

I'm very grateful this is not within walking distance to me, otherwise I probably wouldn't make it to the opening of their next store once they get start expanding."}
{"text":"As a Philly girl, I had to try the latest \"authentic\" cheesesteak shop in the Vegas Valley.  Let me first say, I was pleasantly surprised.  They got it right.  From the hogie roll to the cheese.

I ordered the regular cheesesteak with white american, grilled onions and peppers (peppers are not 'real' original cheesesteak, but I love 'em).  It was fantastic! The hogie roll was soft and fresh, the meat was thin and well seasoned, the onions and peppers were cooked perfectly.  I could have not have asked a better cheesesteak.  I will share it in the future though; I could not even finish half.

The special of the day was free fries and a soda with a sandwich purchase, so we got that too.  The fries were the only disappointment.  I ate only half of one single fry.  They had a really weird, gross coating on them.  I am very glad that I didn't pay for them and would never order them again.  Luckily, there is no need for a side dish here, the cheesesteaks hold their own."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich! They are giant no need for frys, they were really good as well. Will return again"}
{"text":"The place is legit. I got the cheesesteak with bacon and the garlic fries. The fries are mostly in the fridge because the the steak was big, filling, and really tasty."}
{"text":"i am a fan of phillys best.. but this place is actually very tasty and i will def come back.
a little pricey though. but i love the foods!"}
{"text":"I tried the mushroom cheesesteak with grilled onions. The size of the sandwich is just right. Plenty of meat, mushrooms,  onions, and CHEESE!  Thank the good Lord above. I've had too many dry, where the # is the cheese, I paid twelve bucks for this, cheesesteaks in Vegas.   This was a relief. The menu has many cheesesteak options, burgers, gyros,  and a few pretty cool french fries options. I'll be back to try some of different steaks for sure."}
{"text":"When you look at a menu, you should expect to have the menu items list all the ingredients. This place doesn't do that, and they even put up a disclaimer so that they cannot be blamed if the customer does not get the sandwich they are expecting. That's when you realize how poor the customer service is. Recommend staying away from this place, since they clearly do not care about their customers. Check out the response below and you can see the bad attitude! Rude!"}
{"text":"The Philly cheese steak and fries were amazing! They honored public safety and gave me a discount for being a firefighter. The guy in the back was cute too! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, they have a lunch special which includes 1/2 sandwich, french fries, and a drink for $5.98. Not a bad deal at all! The place was a little hard to find, so to help make it easier for you to find, it's near the corner of the shopping center, a little farther down from Faustos. Try em out if your craving a Philly!"}
{"text":"Had seen this place a few times and had been wanting to try it. I wish I had earlier. 
It's got a nice locals thing going. The people who work here are nice and you can tell they get to know their regulars. 
I plan to bring my dad back soon. Heck I might just start finding random people to bring here so I can eat here more . 
My boyfriend had the north philly and said it's one of the best he has had outside of being in Philly. I had the Smokin Chicken. I couldn't finish it but I really tried. It was so good."}
{"text":"Have not been disappointed with their menu yet. Great comfort food! A little pricey so we only go every couple of months, but still live it."}
{"text":"It's cool.
After a strange snafu where they weren't open at opening time because the cook and cashier were both running late (?!), we did actually make it in for a steak.
The steaks are decent - full of meat, and with lots of options for toppings.
Same for the fries - lots of topping options.
Takes a while to get your sandwiches, but that's to be expected when they're cooking them fresh.
Prices are a little high.
Cool place to have around, but not cool enough for me to drive back."}
{"text":"Solid cheesesteaks, but just too heavy on the whiz.
Prices are reasonable and service is fast.
If you're in the area, Straight from Philly is a decent stop. If you're searching out a great Vegas cheesesteak, go to POP's."}
{"text":"Straight From Philly - Henderson, NV

I've been to Straight From Philly's original location off Stephanie St. a few years ago.  Honestly, I wasn't a huge fan and in my opinion, felt that their cheesesteaks were more greasy than tasty.  So, when this location opened, I was in no rush to check them out.  My co-worker has been wanting to try this place and I finally gave in.  I was in the area and my co-worker wanted something greasy and fatty.  We decided to dine at Straight From Philly because greasy and fatty is exactly what you're going to get here.  I opted for their Da' Beefy Burger, which is basically a pastrami burger.  My co-worker got their cheesesteak.  The highlight of my meal was the pastrami and the overall size of my burger.  The bun was cold and the patty was just okay. But there is some good news.  The customer service is excellent.  The staff did a great job explaining the menu, handling customers, and keeping our drinks full.  Price for almost everything on their menu is better than average and they hook it up.  Overall, Straight From Philly is just okay."}
{"text":"I've had a true Philly cheesesteak a few times in my life and admit, Straight From Philly makes a mean, true to Philly tasting cheesesteak. I've never had Pat's, but have sampled Geno's. And if you ever tried Geno's and liked their's, then you'll love what Straight From Philly has to offer.  They hook it up here with big portions and low prices.  The staff is great, very professional, and the restaurant is clean. So, why the 3 stars? First of all, 3 stars is not horrible. In my opinion, Straight From Philly is just okay. I've never been a huge fan of a legit Philly cheesesteak, especially since most that I've tried have been flavorless and greasy. Straight From Philly is no different. I prefer a juicy not greasy steak burger over a cheesy, greasy cheesesteak any day. My opinion about Straight From Philly is just that, my opinion. When it comes to a cheesesteak made the way it's suppose to be made, Straight From Philly does it right. I'm just not a fan."}
{"text":"Maybe I've been watching too many episodes of Restaurant Makeover, but I was not impressed AT ALL, especially after reading previous reviews. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is the food....the only saving grace. I live close to the Lake Mead location and try to frequent local joints. First,  I paid $12.38 for a soda and a chessesteak with GP, shrooms, onions. The quality of the food was good (shaved steak ) but damn, I don't want to take out a loan for lunch!  The menu is a banner hung on the wall, small print, hard to read....and NO prices. The place itself is on the shabby side, a couple of photos thrown up of Philly, a bunch of boxes on the counter, and a green frog with the ONLY printed menu that says \"do not take.\"  What?  That's like saying \"you can look at my business card, but you can't keep it.\"  None of the tables were wiped off, various crumbs and some napkins left by a fellow diner. Yuck! And the counter help (both of them) just sittig around gabbing, watching TV,  while a new customer came in and sat at a table not cleaned off after previous customers ate there. Makes me wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen! Admonishments about dispensing some various sauces in bottles into a plastic ramekin, DON'T take the bottle to your table..... tacky!  Staff seemed friendly enough and the food was decent (though pricey for the ambiance and location) free soda refills, but overall I was disappointed in just about every other aspect of this place. I hope their business survives, but I give it 6 months. I won't be back."}
{"text":"If you love heart attack food, this place is a top contender!

So far I've tried the bacon philly with added jalapeños, I tried the Cuban philly, and just a basic cheesesteak. All three were just amazing as far as flavor, cheesiness, and the bread is so soft! I never was a big time cheesesteak fan until eating at this place.

Their service was really good as well. I felt at home and I will definitely be back...for a 3rd time.

HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"Man. This place is awesome.  Love the service and consistency of the food.  Who doesn't love a good philly cheesesteak with wiz! Onions and meat are spot On! Great job"}
{"text":"Straight From Philly is literally a mom-and-pop-joint in a half-empty plaza.

I didn't actually ask, but I didn't have to after seeing the daughter of the only two workers. The fact that they stopped doing business on Mondays probably suggests some family obligation or perhaps an after-school activity.

I think you want to hear about the food though. They have hoagies with different meats, the option to substitute chicken in a cheesesteak, a variety of cheesesteaks with not-so-traditional toppings, burgers, fries, and even a gyro. However, I chose the standard cheesesteak wit (i.e. \"with onions\"), plus mushrooms, bell peppers, and sweet peppers that were all complimentary thanks to their \"Three Topping Tuesday\" special. Good value for $9.34 with tax, including some free ice cream that I'll mention later. 

The sandwich was dripping with of juices, and it had so many toppings that you'll need to be careful about spillage. Definitely get a fork to eat what actually lands in your tray. I managed to find the fully melted cheese at the bottom (near the \"hinge\") but would've liked it spread out more evenly. It was American, which the mom explained is the default and the more traditional choice instead of provolone. There wasn't a real abundance of the other toppings, so I'm glad I wasn't shelling out extra for them.

I've noticed a consistent \"underseasoning\" of cheesesteaks wherever I've eaten (unfortunately, nothing in Philadelphia yet), and this was the case here as well. After consulting with a friend who recently visited Philadelphia and ate several cheesesteaks, I have to conclude that most cheesesteaks actually should taste a little lacking in salt. Funny thing is we both observed that cheesesteaks that come with Cheez Whiz do not have this condition. In light of these findings, my evaluation is that my cheesesteak today was pretty solid. Next time I go here, I'll consider ordering extra whiz (which is listed on at least one menu item, so I know they have it).

I was still considering a lower rating, but what won me over was the ice cream that's still free with purchase (which makes you wonder if they've raised cheesesteak prices to compensate). I instantly recognized it as Thrifty ice cream upon seeing the chocolate malted crunch (among 9 other flavors). Actually, I wanted to have chocolate brownie walnut, but the mom had difficulty getting out a full scoop of it and offered to add on a free second flavor. I went back to the malted crunch, at which time I learned that her full scoop is a pretty generous size. The ice cream had about the same taste and texture as any Thrifty ice cream, and it saved me an extra trip elsewhere for dessert. (Another thing that won me over: when I asked for a cup for water, the guy gave me a complimentary bottle of almost frozen water after informing me that the water spigot in the soda fountain was broken.)

Straight From Philly is definitely worth a try if you live or spend time in Henderson and/or if you want to support a small business. It might not blow you away, but you'll leave with a smile."}
{"text":"I'm from Philly..  Straight from Philly is the real deal.  They use Amoroso rolls which is a staple in Philly for any cheesesteak.  the service here is great too.  If you're looking to try a real Philly cheesesteak, go here."}
{"text":"Food is good the only reason I am giving 3 stars is because poor health sanitation i ordered a philly and jalapeño chilli cheese fries. My fries had a long piece of hair in it and I noticed that the cook didn't have a hair net or a chef hat while cooking the food. The cook had along hair."}
{"text":"First time here and was very impressed. Love the \"mom and pop\" places. Had the north philly and the only thing is next time I will add extra prove. But that is personal preference. Other than that it was awesome. Will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"For years I have driven by this small and unassuming sandwich shop without much more than a second look. But I saw on Yelp that it has some solid reviews and figured I should add my name to the ranks. I do love a good Philly cheese steak and so many places have just a standard versions with beef, peppers, onions and provolone. Every now and again you will find one with mushrooms as well. They are fine sandwiches but are a one in the same more often than not. At Strait From Philly they do it a different way. 

They have many sandwich choices each with chicken or beef and with a number of topping options. Of course I went with the mushroom Philly. I ordered it \"wit fried onion.\" The standard option for cheese is American. You may also select from cheeze whiz, mozzarella, or provolone (I think those were the choices). I went with the cheeze whiz.

It took a while for sandwich to come up. Just shy of 10 minutes. But it came out hot and fresh. I took it to go. It took me a little more than 5 minutes to get home but the sandwich was still piping hot. And oh the smells. The beef and fried onions perfumed my car and dining room so much my mouth was watering. I knew then this would be a good sandwich.

My first bite was an introduction to the roll. That soft and chewy hoagie roll enveloping the cheesy beefy goodness within. It was perfect. Not too chewy. Not at all dry. Firm enough to hold up to the cheese and beef juice. Bravo. The beef was next up. Tender and flavorful. Hot and plentiful. Intertwined with the gooey whiz and fried onions. The onions were cooked enough to soften the bite and start the sweetness. The mushrooms were the unfortunate weird guy in the corner of a party trying to have a good time. I'm pretty sure they were not fresh 'shrooms. They tasted, and felt, more like canned mushrooms. I don't mind canned mushrooms but when everything else is so fresh, canned just falls short. Aside from that, this was one of the best Phillys I've had in a long time.

The sandwiches here are a pretty good size but at $9.50, so was the price. I found myself still a little hungry after finishing my sandwich. I wished I had ordered some fries. Maybe their garlic fries, for example. When I get a standard cheese steak from other places I may not get as good a sandwich as from here but I would get fries and still pay about the same price. I know I'm paying for quality at Strait From Philly and thats fine. Its just a thought."}
{"text":"A bit hard to find since the sign outside just says \"cheesesteaks\". The food was a bit on the rich side, but overall it was really delicious. 

I had the Philly fries and a garlic parm cheesesteak. I would definitely come back, but probably try some other stuff. 

If I lived closer, I would probably order for delivery off one of the apps pretty often."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!!

Drove right by this place at first, but that was my fault. Nice little shop. Ordered the North Philly, which has mushrooms, bell peppers and provolone. Added the grilled onions as well. The sandwich came out hot, overflowing with meat and melting cheese. 

My husband and I shared this sandwich, and we were full. One of best cheesesteak sandwiches we have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Ate here this evening. Ordered the mushroom philly with cheese wiz and grilled onions with a side of fries. Service was great. Very friendly and only took about 5 minutes to make my order. On the positive side the sandwich was really good. Beef was tender, bread was soft and toppings were very good. On the negative side the fries were awful. Couldn't even eat them. The place is also quite a bit pricey. Over $12 for sandwich and fries. I'll more than likely try this place again at some point but will be skipping the fries."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Straight from Philly.  When the girl behind the counter realized it was our first time in she suggested their most popular items.  We had the North Philly and we were not disappointed.  Place was clean. Good service. Good food."}
{"text":"As a native Pittsburgher, a cheesesteak is common and a Philly one is the ultimate. This place is as close to home as it gets out here and it's a good one! Even the chicken cheesesteak is pretty good. I would pass up their fries next time because they have that battered quality that I don't care for but sandwiches are a win!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing... i got the garlic Philly cheese steak and fries. It was probably the bast Philly i have had. The staff was very friendly. Only reason im giving it 4 stars is because it was all counter service so the wont bring it to the table. Not a big deal but that would make it perfect.."}
{"text":"Let me first say I'm not a big fan of cheese (yeah, I know. What's wrong with me.)  So I ordered a cheesesteak with EZ cheese and it was PERFECT. I had it with red peppers, banana peppers and mushrooms. My friend had the cheesesteak with banana peppers, mushrooms and bacon. The bacon was a little too overpowering, I would recommend a different choice of topping. 
Straight From Philly didn't give me that horrible \"I'm never eating that again\" feeling I usually get from meals like this. The sandwich is by no means healthy, but as a previous Yelper said, it's not dripping in grease either. 

Every sandwich comes with a free scoop of ice cream. Check out their weekly specials!"}
{"text":"Food was great besides my wife finding a piece of hair in her food.  I would advise the staff to wear hairnets."}
{"text":"Hands down best Philly Cheesesteak I've had in a long time!!! Service was good, drinks were somewhat high priced (for me but not really compared to other places in Vegas) but fortunately there is a store right next door. This place is definitely one to be visited, the food is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Ain't no better cheesesteaks in Hendo, I guarantee!!!"}
{"text":"They don't mess around! My husband and I spent quite some time in the Philly area and these guys nailed it! Great service, the workers are always chill and friendly. Awesome cheesessteaks, i always get the chicken cheesesteak with mushrooms and onions and it comes out perfect with melty cheese on a fresh, chewy roll. The husband always gets the a regular cheesesteak and devours the whole thing! Each sandwich is made fresh to order, so it does take a minute especially if they are busy, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! The cheesesteaks are phenomenal. They also make a great gyro. The fries are fantastic. They have a variety of lunch and dinner specials. It's a hidden treasure in downtown Henderson!"}

Oh thoses Cheese Steaks are just like you get in Philly.
WILL Be BACK for SURE 
AnnPatrice Aka AP"}
{"text":"Good, but not great.  I spent several years in the Philly/Jersey shore area and have had many amazing cheesesteaks.  The sandwich was huge with lots of meat but it was missing something.  Maybe the quality of the meat or the cheese, maybe a different olive oil.  I don't know but it just wasn't the same.  And that's fine, this is Vegas afterall.  I'm sure the chow mein in China tastes very different than here.  And the service was slooooow.  Had a one hour lunch, was told the wait was 15 mins and 30 mins later we had to take it to go.  Very little seating inside.

I usually give a restaurant a second chance (in case it was just having a bad day) so will probably go back at least one more time to try something different.  Had the steak, provolone and mushroom this time.  Maybe the Italian beef and peppers.  I'll rethink my rating then."}
{"text":"Very delicious chesse steak sandwitch.. lots of variations of other cheese steak sandwitches, bread was soft food is cooked to order. Fries are crispy. Staff was friendly. Over all great place for a yummy satisfying cheese steak sandwitch"}
{"text":"My review stands even after an inevitable response. I guess the \"experience\" of wanting good service without an attitude is too much to ask for here. The \"experience\" of a having an owner acknowledge and mention the \"posted specials\" during the actual visit or make customers feel welcomed should not be expected here. The \"experience\" of having an employee initially tell you that \"they do not offer any hot sauce\" (no mention of fire or hell) and then hand you a cup of mystery hot sauce is acceptable because in an establishment that serves cheesesteak, they do not have to offer you anything else because they are \"no nonsense\". What is nonsense is this combative reply, among other combative replies posted in response to truthful & less than stellar reviews, that serves no purpose but an attempt to quell an owner's bruised ego because something lacking was pointed out."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness... Ever since I moved here from Pennsylvania a little over a year ago, I've been wanting to try this place. I finally got the chance to today and it was the best decision I've made in a while!!! I've been telling my bosses about Cheese Whiz on a cheesesteak is just the right way to do it!! When they walked around the office getting orders, I told them I wanted Whiz. I got a weird look and got told they weren't sure if they'd do it, but they'd try. I told them if this place serves authentic Philly cheesesteaks, they'll have it - I even bet them a dollar!! Well needless to say, I made a dollar tonight! These sandwiches are huge and packed with meat and toppings! It's only a mile down the road, but they were still piping hot when we opened them up!! I am so excited to have this place so close to home - I'm a guaranteed return customer!!!"}

{"text":"On a day that I needed comforting the most, I found this wonderful gem. Thank you for raising the bar for good, delectable food in the valley. I'm from Chicago, so I know what good food should taste like and this place reminds me of home. Just good and comforting. My husband was even satisfied and he a vegetarian!!! You made him so happy when you offered to make him a veggie philly. He said, this place deserves a Yelp...So here I am. Keep up the good work and great customer service. When I called, I spoke with nicest person ever. (Very rare in the valley). I love giving my money where I am appreciated and your customer service showed me how much you value your customers. THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"This place is good! The employees are amazing! Hey have specials everyday! Variety here as well! Clean , I will def. be back"}
{"text":"This place is my best friend's addiction. It's right by his house, which adds to the non-problem, but yeah. I personally think it's good but not something that I need. The food is good, definitely great for hangovers, but just not my favorite. 
The first time I came I got the chicken parmigiana sandwich, and it was pretty delicious. I have stolen bits of my friends' cheesesteak fries, which are excellent. I have also gotten the garlic parm cheesesteak, which was ok, a little heavy on the garlic, but the steak was tasty. I think I was sad because I wanted the gooey cheese whiz, but whatever. Nice people working in here, convenient location and fairly priced food. But the real thing here.... :
*THE FRIES ARE THE BEST FRIES I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!* Do not come here without getting some fries on the side. Your life will change. They're crispy and seasoned perfectly. So amazing. I can't eat other fries anymore. Come check it out! I've never been to Philly but the food here makes me wanna go. :)"}
{"text":"This is the first time I visited this location and it was ok.  Like a previous reviewer said, my sandwich also had a lot of grease in the dish and it was not from the onions as one possibility he gave because even though I said wit, there were very little onions on my sandwich which means it must have come from the beef.

Overall the sandwich was a decent size, the fries were good, seasoned well and the staff was nice.

The location is on the corner of Lake Mead and Water street, large Yellow sign that says cheese steaks, burgers, gyros which is much more noticeable then the name of the place.  So if you see this sign, you found it.  

This is the only place I have found on this side of town that serves an authentic Philly as the owners are from Philly and they know what a real philly should taste like.

I am sure I will go to this place again as it is not far from the house.  The prices are average and the food is decent.  The staff is good and I keep seeing Free Ice Cream was given in some reviews, however it has never been offered to me so I am not sure what they are doing different then me."}
{"text":"First time here, came because of reviews on Yelp.  I must say I was not offered FREE ice cream as some other reviewers have been but that's ok.  

One review said they charge higher prices and give you something for free...NOPE..
I compared their price of just a basic cheese steak compared to another favorite of mine and not only is this place .50 cheaper, depending on the day of the week you come, this place does give you something for free.

I was glad to see today was a free drink with a purchase and after living in Philly for 6 years, I must say this place is pretty good.  The sandwich is meaty however the one issue I had here which I have never had before was some fat mixed in with the meat.  Someone missed taking the fat out before cooking the meat so there were a few chunks of fat in there.

Overall though it was a good cheese steak and hopefully they will stay in business as we don't really have any other authentic place to get a good Cheese Steak sandwich in the Henderson area.  Yes there are lots of places that make a Cheese Steak, but none like the ones you get in Philly.  

I did ask the guy who said he was from the south side and North Philly that the steaks here are not like Gino's or Pat's and I did notice a little difference in what you would get if you were in Philly and were expecting something like you get on the other side of town here in Vegas, but it was close and it was good.

This is a place I can go back to as the service was good and it seemed to have a nice flow of people,   I had the traditional Cheese Steak with American Cheese and it was not bad.  I am glad today was not free fry day because the sandwich alone was enough.  According to the take out menu they are open 7 days a week and close early on Wednesday and Sunday but that's ok because I know where to get a fix if needed fro a place open 24/7."}
{"text":"Crappie food, cold food and expensive!  Also lot's of grease on my fries! (See picture below) it's only been open 5 months but I will never come back. 
To feed 2 people with 2 drinks $24+dollars."}
{"text":"I'm not one to leave a review, but this place was worth giving a review. They deserve it. The garlic parm philly was amazing! The gentlemen that helped us was the owner I believe, very friendly. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The North Philly was good and filling. And the parmesan garlic fries did not disappoint! Yummy!"}
{"text":"I won't pretend to be any sort of Philly cheesesteak connoisseur. I do like sandwiches, but I know that folks from the city of Brotherly Love are fanatics about this particular type of dish and I I'm not going to try and bluff my way past them.

That being said, the sheer variety of Philly options on the menu should leave no one hungry. Seriously, if you can dream it up, I'm guessing this place will make it for you. There's no shortage of meat, cheese, onion, pepper, etc. options to go through. I had the South Philly on my last visit because cheese whiz on a sandwich sounded like fun. And it was, until I burnt the hell out of my mouth (not their fault). I was also appreciative of the three different types of hot sauces available. For fry lovers, they also have a lot of types of those, too."}
{"text":"This is a really good cheesesteak sandwich. Good flavor and NO freezer burned meat. Even after taking it home, with all the grease in the bun, it's still really good.

The downside Is the staff. The two girls (when I was there) just seem so miserable. No smiles, no thank you. Just robotic."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS: GOOD 

  Straight from the heart, I am writing that it is wonderful to live in a metropolitan area that is a melting pot of food from throughout the world. Yesterday, I was in the mood for some out of this world philly cheesesteak. So, I motored on down to Straight From Philly. 

   If it weren't for Yelp and the Internet, it would be a challenge to find Straight from Philly. There is a want of signing to advertise the small family-owned shop in the half-abandoned Stephanie Promenade Shopping Center at the northwest corner of Stephanie and American -Pacific. Along the shopping center, it is difficult to spot. 

  Where there is a want of advertising the restaurant, there is no shortage of good customer service. On my second visit here, the owner and an employee were friendly and prepared a delicious sandwich. Straight from Philly is a mom and pop shop. Your money goes to a small business that is actually becoming a bigger business. Recently Straight from Philly opened another location off of Lake Mead Parkway and Water Street at the Gateway to downtown Henderson. 

  On my first visit, I ordered a hoagie special. A few months ago in January, Straight from Philly featured a different lunch special for each day of the week excluding Sunday when they were closed. I remember the roast beef hoagie with fries that I ate on January 7 as being delicious. Fast forward to halfway into the year, and Straight from Philly offers a few daily specials from 11 to 4 with the $10.15 philly cheesesteak  with fries and Coke fountain drink for $10.15 plus tax all day long.

  The cheesesteak special was delicious. Ditto for the fries. Reviewing a restaurant that celebrates Philly cheesesteaks from the City of Brotherly Love, I have to write with some tough yelp love that Straight from Philly needs to include cheese and toppings with the  special. Honestly, isn't there supposed to be cheese on a cheesesteak? Regardless that the delicious sandwich was loaded with quality meat in a tasty bun with onions and prepared by the owner was GOOD; melted cheese with mushrooms would WOW me to the degree that I would become a regular and up my rating, which is a reflection of my opinion to four stars: I am a fan.

8/22/2015 UPDATE: No more daily specials and complimentary ice cream."}
{"text":"This is the best Philly I have had in Vegas. Probably the best I have had outside of Philly. 

The meat is flavored amazingly. 
The topping selection is awesome. 
The bread is fresh and delicious. 
The cheese is your choice - American, provolone, or whiz. All yumtastic. 

Get here and get a sammich that will make you smile. F'real doh."}
{"text":"After walking in on a Friday night and being told they were out of almost everything I said I would come back and give them another try. I wish I hadn't. For a place that claims to be Straight From Philly and has pics of Philadelphia landmarks on the wall, I was not impressed. 

$60 and 4 cheesesteaks to go turned into a very disappointing experience. From the canned mushrooms to meat that was flavorless, this was not a good experience. My kid will eat almost anything, but when he handed us his onion rings back and put his sandwich in the dog bowl I knew it wasn't just bad, this was a one and done experience. Then when my wife looked at me and said never again because it was the most boring and bland cheesesteak she had ever had...I knew things were going from bad to worse. I'll try almost anything once...and I was hungry so I did eat about half of my cheesesteak, but I was left thinking it wasn't all that. In the end we had some very happy dogs who took care of the rest of it...

The staff here is friendly and I know this is a small shop that is trying to grow their business. I hate giving them a 1 Star review. But I have to call it as it is, good, bad, or even ugly. When I end up putting essentially 3 1/2 sandwiches in the dog bowl...that's 1 Star territory. I hope everyone else that tries them has a better experience but for me and my family who wish the East side of Henderson had more food choices, this is one place that will not be seeing us again."}
{"text":"I live close to this place and I'm lovin it! The food is amazing and the people are really friendly. Im only disappointed that I didn't start coming here sooner, if you are looking for some bomb cheesesteaks come here! You will NOT be disappointed! The guy that makes them has the coolest personality too"}
{"text":"Came here from out of town. Amazing food and even better customer service. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hubby and I ordered a cheese steak to go with hot peppers, onions and mushrooms. They are definitely not skimpy with the filling as it was a pretty large, filling sandwich.  We split one cheese steak and I was definitely full and finished my half even though I probably should have stopped..lol!
I also liked that the hot peppers were very hot!  I actually had to pull some peppers out bc my mouth was on fire!  
Next time I will probably order there and  try it fresh with some fries.
Definitely my new cheese steak spot as my last cheese steak from the place I normally go to was inedible."}
{"text":"Service was prompt. Tried the North philly and Da' Beefy and they were both OH SO GOOD!!!! Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I come here at least once a month and they're always improving!! The lines have gotten increasingly longer but that's expected with good food! They have amazing friendly staff, my favorite being Douglas of course!! He's so friendly and made us feel beyond welcome the first time we came here The best of all though, is the food!!! They have amazingly good cheesesteaks that are huge and definitely have a good portion of meat on them. The burgers are also to die for!! I love the bacon cheeseburgers here, I wouldn't prefer a burger from anywhere else! The bacon is always cooked to perfection and the meat is always so good! Love this place overall"}
{"text":"I've had Pat's and Geno's, Sonny's and Tony Luke's. I've always claimed Tony Luke's as the all time reigning champion. Damn you Scott and your Straight from Philly Cheesesteak. I barely made it to Philly enough to satiate my craving. Now to have to fly to Vegas? Legit, one of, if not THE, best cheesesteak I've had. And Scott is a cool dude to talk to while you wait. I could tell it was going to be good from how long the drive felt with the scent of cheesesteak in the car. Sign number two was the greasy bag. The sandwich was gone in under a minute."}
{"text":"Don't go here! They would not resend our food even though they delivered it over an hour early. All we are left with is nasty cold food."}
{"text":"The best Philly in Las Vegas ... I think this is the only place serves chezwhiz on their philly... better than Geno's and Pats Philly ... Lots of meat ..."}
{"text":"Big sandwich, filling for sure. Came pretty late in the night not sure if it was last of meat. Had some dried out meat. Fries where cold. Not on my yelp list to try again"}
{"text":"Flipping bomb. Soooooo good. Like honestly, I was nervous but this was incredible. I got the sweet pepper cheese steak with onions and whiz and it was amazing. My hubby got the H Bomb and loved it. Fries are outstanding. Go here. You won't be bummed."}
{"text":"We were in town for a wedding and looked up a close place to eat.  They did not disappoint.  Philly cheesesteak with onions and peppers were excellent."}
{"text":"Best Philly cheesesteak (I can 100% positively say) I've ever had! 
First off, don't mind the location and it's outside environment. Don't let that stop you from entering! 
I came here to try why this place seemingly was very popular here for the cheesesteaks, so that's what I rated this on. 
Younger gal working the cashier taking orders can be less stern and more welcoming- but besides the point- 5 STARS for this cheesesteak! We came on a Friday afternoon around 11am (and on Fridays they have an $11 cheesesteak/fries+drink special). I went with a mushroom cheesesteak, with fried onions and cheese whiz and my lady got herself a plain steak no cheese sub. It was busy yet we didn't wait much long! Maybe around 5 mins or so. 
And the portions are pretty big!! Lots of meat on the infamous (Philly's own) amoroso roll. 
The fries weren't really as hot but it tasted really good still. *I recommend this place to anybody who's serious about a legit cheesesteak!*
Thank you very much Straight From Philly."}
{"text":"Tucked away on Stephanie, the sandwich is very good and the fries are terrific. No prices on the menu is odd and they apparently charge for add-ons - onions, sweet & hot peppers. Worth a 2nd try."}
{"text":"Uhmmmmmm..... this place delivers ?!?!?! 

Seriously. SO GOOD. I got a normal philly; it was my first time eating here and I wanted to just check it out. Their delivery times are pretty accurate so expect the time they tell you. 

My boyfriend ordered a burger and fries, he also ordered the atomic cheese fries and he ate it ALL. So good- we felt good after we ate it too. It didn't sit weird with us like some places do.. 

Did I mention they deliver ?! Reasonably  priced food tasted great; we will definitely be ordering from here again ! Already looking forward to it !"}
{"text":"Loved their other location, saw they opened one up across the street from my job, had to go there for lunch. They did not disappoint at this new location. Absolutely the best cheese steak I've had since i moved out west! The meat was cooked to perfection, the cheese was melted just right, n the bread was so soft! I also tried their bacon cheese fries, n for the first time in a while, I enjoyed cheese-wiz on something. Service was very friendly, it takes a little bit of time for them to make ur order, but it was well worth the wait, plus great food takes time to make! I was already a fan of theirs, now I'm a follower of theirs!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here.  It definitely won't be my last!  Phillies are delicious!  Fries are great!  The service is amazing!"}
{"text":"Love love love their Cheesesteak & Garlic Parm Fries!! Found this little gem in Henderson and I will be back for more! I highly recommend if you're craving some bomb cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp the other day while leaving a review for someone, and SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HAPPYYYYYYYYYY I did, located right around the corner from me, a little hard to find at first, but that's the only bad thing I can say about this place. Ordered the bacon Philly cheese steak hero with bacon and cheese fries (no I don't have a death wish) :D, it was so filling and great tasting  I was impressed, the staff made me feel like I was a regular there, and will be from now on. Great food guys. Thanks for a great dining experience. See you again real soon. Too bad they now moved away from my area.."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 North Philly cheese steaks tonight. They were absolutely deliciousI'm a Jersey girl, and I must say these are awesome sandwiches. Thank you Straight from Philly for bringing some authentic east coast flavor to the wild west!!!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought that you can get an authentic cheesesteak near Lake Las Vegas?  I had the sweet pepper cheesesteak hoagie, and it was great all the way around, with the right kind of meat, cheese and peppers.  Fresh summer tomatoes were a bonus. I lived in Philly for 10 years and I highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food was good.  I used a credit card to purchase my meal.  The card reader they use has a feature where you put in a tip amount.  I selected 15% which is generous given the fact the order was take out.  I had the special, which is $22.22 plus tax.  The amount I signed for was approximately $27.00, which after doing the math is the right amount with a 15% tip.  The amount posted to my account $33.00. Since I didn't get a receipt I don't know what happened.  Lesson learned, pay cash or ask for a receipt and check the amount. Not sure if I will return.


UPDATE: Has been corrected."}
{"text":"**** Wow. Nice comment from what I can only assume is the owner. The fact that he's trying to justify shitty food with ridiculous excuses instead of taking feedback from his customers as something worth thinking about is just golden. Saying something doesn't make it true. There was hardly any cheese, def NOT 5 slices on the cheesesteak. The meat was dry & bland & yes I've eaten at plenty of restaurants in my 39 years & yours is only the 2nd place where I've had the displeasure of being served canned mushrooms. If that's the kind of slop they serve in Philly, I have no desire to ever go there nor would I want to continue spending my money in a place that doesn't consider the feedback of their customers & strive to provide a better quality product. 
How about you take the criticism I offered as food for thought? Or you can continue being a jackass to your customers that might not have had the best experience which is probably exactly what you will continue to do. I guess it will be interesting to see how that works out for you in the long run. 


Really disappointed in how far downhill this place has gone. We tried them a while ago & aside from the fact that they are pretty pricey, we thought it was a good quality, tasty cheesesteak. 
FF to this afternoon, hubby picks up a couple cheesesteaks for our lunch. I got the North Philly w/sweet peppers added. Hubby said that they already had the meat cooked & in a container next to the flat top & just threw it on to heat it up. The first time we went, we watched them make our sandwiches with the raw meat. Even tho this new reheating method may save time, I'm pretty sure it's the reason why the meat was so dry. I also think someone forgot to season the meat. Cheese was almost non-existent. Come on, it's in the name - CHEESEsteak. I should at least be able to see some evidence of cheese. The sweet peppers we paid extra for? I counted 6 pieces of sweet pepper. 
& finally, the biggest sin of all? They are now using CANNED mushrooms! There is never a justifiable reason to use canned mushrooms. Ever! lol I'm a bit of a fungi freak so excuse my passion, but I couldn't believe the poor excuse for mushrooms they are now using. 
I almost feel deliberately duped. I feel like they got people hooked when they were first open with an amazing cheesesteak & albeit a bit pricey, I was more than willing to pay for the indulgence every once in a while. Now the prices are the same but the product is not at all worth what they're charging. If you lower the quality, the price needs to be lowered as well."}
{"text":"Super yummy sandwiches  hit the spot for a much desired cheat meal. I could barley eat half because the Philly's are pretty big."}
{"text":"Food is off the hook delish!!
I would have paid more easily.
As far as the FRIES go.
The BEST FRIES I HAVE EVER HAD.
These are the super crispy coated ones.
Awesome!!
The best Phillies, bar none!"}
{"text":"Great little place that I never would have found without Yelp!  The sweet pepper cheese steak was perfect and I was told that the gyro and the chicken sandwiches were also very good. It was a little crowded with locals at lunch, and I understand why. Friendly counter staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!  An awesome steak sammich!  Will come back again!!  Their fries were great and they had a large selection of styles for the fries and the philly sandwiches!"}
{"text":"There's that special something about Straight from Philly. If you want a cheesesteak that's done right this is by far the best one in Town. There's nothing that compares to it. They are without a doubt in a league of their own. I'm used to the So Cal style philly which is usually with a grilled toasted bun and usually come with white american and provolone but the Philly style here with the cheese wiz is so freaking good! The one thing that the guy at front told me before I ordered was We put the cheese wiz on the bread then the meat and veggies at the top so you actually taste the cheese. We don't put on the top. Made me question it but once I took that first bite I totally understood what he meant. I definitely had the eyes rolling back moment after the bite! Love everything about this place and we will continue to travel across town (btw I live in the southwest)  to come here to enjoy a Philly when necessary."}
{"text":"I had their philly cheese steak sandwich  and  it was very messy but tasted GREAT!  Compared it to my memories of this type of sandwich growing up in the NJ-PA area."}
{"text":"New sammich  shop just a short jaunt from home. I am a fan of a good steak hoagie. We have been here twice now so it is good. They take phone orders so order and pick up easy peasy. We both had the Mushroom cheesesteak and next visit I had the Da Beefy. Da Beefy is cheesesteak layered with pastrami and swiss. Fill your gut goodness. All the food so far has been great and will go back again and again. You must try this. My only take away is decor. Shawshank redemption poster on wall is bonus. However, just wrestling posters mostly. As and Eagles fan and other Philly sports I would hope to see some other philly stuff. Even some historical Philly on the wall. No I am not from there but believe I was born at times in the wrong town. Go figure. Eat Here you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"We love the food and the great service, we will return again and again.
Thank you
Dennis"}
{"text":"I was really craving a cheesesteak, and if you have been to Penn station back in the midwest, thats how i like mine. As i was trying to put in my cheese steak order, the guy seemed to be having a little trouble. In the end i had mentioned a couple times i wanted provolone instead - and nonetheless it came out with american cheese. For me it totally changes the sandwich from Philly to more towards cheeseburger. I was more disappointed that it was such a simple mistake. Fries were pretty good, nice and crispy. Overall, not bad. 4/5."}
{"text":"Second time coming here and the experience has been great. First time I came I ordered the half philly sub that comes with fries and a drink but they messed up and gave me a full sub with a drink....can't get mad about that.
This time I got the philly fries and they are soooooo goooooood! 
The employees smile and are fast.
Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Love this place! Cool friendly people, great food, and nice casual atmosphere with good music on the background!  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is as close to Philly as you can get in Nevada. Great choice of steaks and toppings with plenty of sides.
Prices are good and there are menu specials. Small parking lot and seating for around 28 so it can get crowded."}
{"text":"Definitely glad we found this little gem! Wasn't busy because we came in before closing time. Orders were ready quick! 

All American burger 
Philly cheese steak
Chili cheese fries 

Will definitely be back to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome family owned and operated food is amazing. Make sure you get a order of garlic parm fries, the best fries ever."}
{"text":"Hands down literally the best Philly place.  I loved it I scarfed it down lol I barley took time to breath it was cooked just right and perfect definitely wanted to go back today but they are closed  still an amazing place tho !!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the bacon cheesesteak. A little over priced but decent meal. Staff was quiet. Unfortunately I wouldn't suggest it to anyone from out of town."}
{"text":"It was so Delicious, just had the basic lunch special cheesesteak with fries and a drink 6$ and it was just the right amount to satisfy my hunger. I will definitely be back to try the others!!!"}
{"text":"Hot damn this place is delicious. I've been wanting to come here for a while after hearing about how good it was. Hands down this is the best Philly I've ever had. I got mine with provolone, onions, and bell peppers. Every bite was just as delicous as the last. Everything was oozing out from being so cheesy. The service was also wonderful. Everyone was very friendly. The tables and interior were vary clean.  I will definitely be coming back often!"}
{"text":"The food is good the price is right. The french fries are to die for. Girl at the counter not so friendly. She could've been more helpful. She didn't welcome me or ask if I had been there before which I hadn't. My husband has picked up for us. She didn't ask or prompt me for anything like, would I like mayonnaise or If I'd like lettuce and tomato anything like that. They are using the Decor from the old diner that was there. Which is fine, it seems fitting.  We will go back because the cheesesteak is delicious."}
{"text":"Randomly riding around looking at local life... felt by get pains. Yelp lead us yo this spot. Who doesn't love a good Philly right? 

Passed it because I missed the sign... nothing a quick Uturn couldn't fix. Small parking lot. The place looks like a liquor store next to a laundromat. Inside is nice. Looks clean. 

Lady behind the counter was nice. She directed us through the menu and gave us tips on local favs. Ordered a couple if \"Da Beefy\" combos (cheese steak with pastrami and grilled onions + fries and a drink).  We took a seat & noticed each table had what looked like hot sauce.

Food came out pretty quickly. Fries were crispy seasoned fries - good. I tried the secret sauce on the fries... was a lot like watered down tabasco sauce... more vinigery than spicy. The sandwich looked BOMB when it came to the table. 

I wanted to love this sandwich... everything about it looked so appetizing. But............... the bun was cold... soft and fluffy... but cold. The pastrami was thin slices like thinly sliced deli meat... not grilled at all... then the steak was chopped but lacked flavor.... a little salt and pepper would have gone A LONG WAY. The grilled onions were on point. Very good Textually speaking the sandwich was on point. The addition of the secret sauce did make that sandwich much more flavorful, but I pity those who don't get the sauce.

Would I return? If I was on that side of town, I probably would. I would just bring my own seasoning to add flavor. Textures are on point. Just a little more flavor and they won't be beat."}
{"text":"Love the family owned feeling and atmosphere. The cheesesteaks are good and the prices are justified. Great to see another small business try their luck. Highly recommend you try it as well as support the locals!"}
{"text":"The cheesesteaks here are LEGIT! I lived in Philly for 5 years before coming here and I've had a craving for a halfway decent one for a while. Straight from Philly delivered the cheesesteak goods! My husband and I ordered a cheesesteak and a chicken steak, both with Provolone. Got light onions and peppers on the chicken steak and both hit the spot. The rolls were soft and delicious. My husband had the fries and he didn't enjoy the seasoning on them. 

The restaurant is not glamorous but it's large and bright (more than I can say for some of the tiny cheesesteak joints in Philly...Philly peeps know some of the hole in the awl places that I'm talking about - even though the steaks at those places are usually amazing!). The service is good and we were served pretty quickly (and yes, they made everything to order). 

They have a great special on Saturday - a cheesesteak, fries and a drink, for $10.15, which is a good deal. 

This place is fairly close to my house so I know it's going into the rotation. I already want another one!"}
{"text":"One of the best Philly cheesesteaks and gyro's we've ever had. Super clean environment and fun people. We'll defiantly be back and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We have been here three times. The first time we went here everything was amazing! Customer service was great as well as the food. The restaurant was clean and inviting. We ordered the same thing each time (Philly cheesesteak and a turkey hoagie). My husband being from philly was excited to try it and said it was very good. My turkey hoagie was one of the best I have ever had. The fries where very good seasoned fries and some of the best fries I have had.  Unfortunately every-time after this was not the same experience. Inconsistent and was different each time. The second trip my turkey hoagie was soggy on the bottom and the bread was super hard and flaking apart everywhere else. My husbands philly was beyond greasy and we ended up throwing most of our food away. So, we went again hoping for the same experience as the first only to be unhappy again. We ordered it togo this time. Again it was overwhelming greasy philly and my hoagie bread was not fresh.  Not to mention the fries where different then the first two times. Not sure if they ran out and was a quick fix or just changed them entirely. I want to love this place, unfortunately they lost a star every time we returned. Inconsistent preparation and fries."}
{"text":"The real deal. Friendly staff, great food, good specials. I had a half cheesesteak wit wiz, fries, and a drink for $6.95. My daughter tried the Italian and loved it."}
{"text":"This place had an amazing all american burger like no joke I'm literally blown away my taste buds are honestly so happy thank you guys"}
{"text":"Lunch special is only $5.95 for a sandwich and bomb ass fries! 

I have been gyro spots around here and was not impressed until I met this joint! The bill fits the meal size, the meat is tasty and customer service was great-friendly and helpful. 

Def returning!"}
{"text":"So freaking good!!!!!

So I've been philly twice while living on the east coast and I had Tony Luke's and Pats cheese steaks and I was super disappointed. However, straight from philly is what I expect my cheese steaks to taste like!!! 

I came around 11:20am and they had a pretty long line but I didn't complain because I figured that meant they were pretty good. The staff was friendly, and the place has tables and a bunch of seating. 

I ordered the half a cheesesteak with bell peppers, grilled onions and provolone cheese  which came with a drink and fries. The food took a little time to cook but everything was fresh. 

A funny thing was this woman who came in and got extremely upset that they do not serve Italian beef. LOL so if you are expecting an Italian beef sandwich- this ain't the spot. It's funny when I look back on it but it definitely made me laugh and won't deter me from coming back. The owner was super cool too!!"}
{"text":"The first few times we went in, the man running the show, who I presume was the owner, was extremely welcoming and seemed to value our business. If memory serves me, his name is Ronald. Growing up in Central New Jersey close to Philadelphia, I know exactly what a Philly cheesesteak should taste like, and this place knows too. Unfortunately, that is where the compliments to this establishment end. They lost my business today, and that falls squarely on one particular employee's shoulders. We were driving to get a cheesesteak, and live about 10 minutes away, so halfway there we decided to call ahead so we wouldn't have to wait. Alexis, a darling little ray of sunshine, answered the phone and informed me with an attitude that they don't do call-ahead orders, but only to-go orders. I said, \"Okay. In that case, I would like to place a to-go order, please.\"  Here's where it gets downright bizarre. She said, \"No! You just said you were going to eat here. We will NOT make it for you until you get here.\"  What, on EARTH is the difference to her? I understand that they have this no call ahead policy, however short sighted it is. I was hungry and did not want to wait, even if that meant eating a messy sandwich in my car, or standing on the sidewalk since we weren't welcome to eat it at their table. What I can't get my head around is the astounding rudeness I was shown. Come Hell or high water, Alexis was gonna win her imaginary battle. She actually refused to let me place a to-go order! All of the people working here when I went in seemed to be family. Alexis must be an hourly employee, though, because she CLEARLY doesn't care about this restaurant, or return customers. She kept saying \"okay have a nice day...\" (In a tone that implied she meant something QUITE different), trying to hang up on me. I asked to speak with the manager, and she smugly replied \"I AM the manager!\" I asked for Ronald (hoping I had the right name), and she said he wasn't there, so I said, \"Oh.. Is that why you are acting this way?\"  As nice as he was to us the first time we ate here, I do not believe that Ronald would treat a customer this way, and I'm guessing he would be appalled to learn that any employee... much less his MANAGER would run a customer out (for good) based on a pointless power struggle she felt the need to have. She could not have possibly cared less whether we ate there or not. I will go back, but not to eat. I'm going back to speak face to face with Ronald. He deserves to know how and why they lost a solid customer. This was so over the top that if I were in his shoes, I would absolutely fire her, family member or part time employee. She is not qualified for her job, snd not qualified to represent him and his business in his absence. I've recommended this place to all of my friends, and that recommendation has now been rescinded. Sorry, Ronald, I thought you had a good thing going there!! I'd consider giving Straight From Philly another chance, if I wasn't concerned that the incredible rudeness with which I was treated wouldn't result in my food being tampered with. I really hate to say it, but this is the type of person she struck me as. Her win-at-all-costs attitude was truly shocking, and the exact opposite of good customer service. Good luck to anyone who decided to patronize this place."}
{"text":"I do not know why I did not take any photos of my sandwhich...I guess I was so excited for the 1st bite that I forgot...or maybe it was because after the 1st bite I didn't want to put it down to take a photo ;)
The sandwich I chose was the garlic Philly with provolone and grilled onions.  For those of you who don't know me...I am SUPER..when I say SUPER picky ....I am SUPER picky about meat. If it has any fat or grizzle...I gag and can't eat another bite. That is why it is usually SO hard for me to eat a Philly cheesesteak sandwhich and get through the entire thing. 
The meat was DELICIOUS...no fat no grizzle...it was heaven in between 2 light and flaky hoagie rolls.  Not only did it have provolone cheese it also was topped with fresh parmesean!!! It  was moist...the onions were soft and the meat melted in my mouth.  I took my co-workers and they both had the chicken Philly, one Hawaiian and one spicy one ...I can't remember the name...we had 2 orders of fries we shared...cheese and bacon and garlic parmesean ...the fries were perfect and had a lot of toppings. 
I also ordered one to take home for the man...had he found out that I had gone without him I would have been in big trouble. I got him the Philly with provolone, mushrooms and onions. He said it was delicious!!
I will be back...it is a problem that it is so close and easy to get to by my work... ;)"}
{"text":"Prompt service, hot food, got the weekend special. Ima big guy so what I got was decent but not the biggest/best  I've sampled but it was worth checking out. The cheesesteak, fries n drink. Onions, cheese, meat, bread, what else could a carnivore like myself want! I was not disappointed in the quality of the food, the bread held the meat nicely ( not soaking through, or falling apart) this IS important. As an east coaster, I know my cheesesteaks, and this is something you gotta consider. Me like, me like! Fries are a nice compliment to the cheesesteak too, great consistency. The peach habanero and banana peppers are a nice addition to any sandwich too. Try this place for sure, You won't leave hungry. Now the thing I did question Is the additional cost for add ons but I guess they gotta keep the lights on, if your wanting extras you better bring it....."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! A little family owned and operated restaurant with great food, and wonderful customer service! If I didn't live in NW las vegas, I would eat here every day. This is the best cheese steak place in Vegas hands down. And I love the square program they use, super convenient."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I had the cheesesteak bomb with the cappicola on the bottom and the cheese and it was excellent. Meat was good and not dry at all. The place is tucked away in a small corner of a very small shopping area. Great mom and pop place for sure. Owner is super nice and came out to ask us how our meal was. 

If your in this area and would like to try a good cheesesteak,  I would highly recommend coming here. I can see why it got good reviews. Also,  the fries are awesome. Try those too"}
{"text":"Great service when we walked in, Lunch special was amazing, plenty of tables to sit, highly recommended if you love a great philly sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is legit and friendly, quick service! Hands down the best cheese steak I've had outside of philly! I don't frequent this area often but I was picking up my son from a birthday party and I noticed \"Straight From Philly\" cheese steak so I had to check them out. It was bangin! I'll be back! Oh and because it was \"Fri day\" I got free fries with my cheese steak. Meaty, cheesy, greasy and the bread was on point too!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome , straight from Philly. The bread comes from a local bakery everything else tasted straight from Philly. The service was amazing , great food definitely a great place to eat."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall place.  Stopped by cuz I wanted a Philly steak and this place did not disappoint me. The price are great took the lunch special u get a half Philly steak a drink and fries for only 7 bucks that's cheap for a lunch.  Try the parmesan fries they are delicous."}
{"text":"This place is a Hidden gem!! Doesn't look like much from the outside and I honestly wouldn't even know it's here if it weren't for yelp. But walking in, I was immediately greeted and my order was taken. Bell pepper cheesesteak, garlic parm cheesesteak and garlic chicken Parmesan fries. The food was amazing!! Definitely worth stopping in. I will be back. 

I do wish they had delivery."}
{"text":"--- Review from www.JerseyGirlinVegas.com ---

Everyone always seems to ask me to be the judge of what's a \"real\" cheesesteak. Honestly, I cringe every time I have to try one outside of the Philly area. Here are some of my red flags which will keep me from even trying a steak sandwich:

1. Calling it a Philly. Seriously, nobody in Philly calls it a \"Philly.\" It's a steak sandwich or a cheesesteak.
2. Weird toppings. Steak sandwiches should only have the following items on them: cheese, onion. No, it's not normal to have teriyaki sauce on it! Ew!
3. I always ask if they chop their steak. Sometimes just their simple head tilt in not knowing what I'm asking says it all. If you don't know the difference between if the steak meat is chopped or not, I don't want to try your sandwich. (I only like my steak sandwiches chopped)

So with that I present to you my latest and greatest find in Las Vegas... Straight From Philly!

If you want a real steak sandwich and cheese fries \"wit wiz\" you MUST check this place out. I really don't know what to say other then it's the best steak sandwich I've found outside of Philly. I'm really hesitant in even finding another joint.

It's located in a strip mall with a banner as its sign, the inside reminds you of a Five Guys and they know what you mean if you ask for a \"wiz witout.\" Enough said.

You want an authentic cheesesteak joint? Here it is!"}
{"text":"Legit sandwiches most of the time. Sometimes they skimp a bit... never looks like the pictures on the wall. For this side of the world they do a pretty good job.

Service  is hit and miss, the guy is always pretty good and makes the sofa refills happen... the girl is usually on her phone or has her headphones in, kinda acts like she's being bothered....


Again overall good food, bread is awesome. Usually good size portions."}
{"text":"This place is legit!! We live on the other side of town and we drive all the way over here to get a philly  cheesesteak.  

The facility is clean, the staff is very friendly and the food is hot!!

The ingredients are fresh and the soft bread is perfect!! 


If you're looking for some good food, look no further!!"}
{"text":"Holy shit man. Hands down THEE ONLY place to satisfy that craving. Fuck capriotties attept at a cheesesteak this place shits all over other competitors! If you can even call them that.

Youll slap yourself for not trying it sooner. Your welcome fam."}
{"text":"YUMMMMM!!

My Hubby had been telling me about this place for awhile and I finally gave in and tried it. Very happy that I did too! 

Apparently they have moved quite a few times over the years and they are currently located near Downtown Henderson on the corner of Water St. and Lake Mead Pkwy. It's a small, unassuming location, but don't let that scare you off. 

I went in around 8:30 on a Saturday night and I was the only customer in there. The staff was friendly and my food was prepared in about 10 minutes. I ordered the hoagie, which is a cheese steak with lettuce and tomato (I got it wit as well). My husband got the mushroom cheese steak and we shared the philly fries. Everything was really good!! I will definitely be back and I wish I had gone while I lived closer."}
{"text":"Honestly !!! Besides the food being AMAZING , ( I got an all veggie cheese  steak , with a little garlic sauce and sweet and hot peppers!!! SO BOMB.... BUT , what really made the experience a 5STAR was The short  handsome light skin man at the counter ! He is what customer service is all about! I wanted to stay for hours and talk to him but he got busy lmao ! Anyway loved the food ! But mostly loved the service ! I'll be back"}
{"text":"I dropped in here for lunch today. I enjoyed my meal at Philly 1, so why not try Philly 2 and its closer to my work.

Its a bit smaller and hard to get into if you come from the east side. Located on the corner of Water and Lake Mead, next to a motel, small market store, and another business. Parking for about 5 cars total. The inside is smaller than Philly 1, with only about 6-8 tables. The menu is nice and large though, and they have expanded their selections with some delicious choices I didn't remember from the first time around, like Garlic Parm cheesesteak.

Being unadventurous, I stuck with the basic cheesesteak and was rewarded with a delicious sandwich. Their bread is really top shelf. Plenty to eat, and the perfect amount of cheese to steak ratio. I'll be back for sure....and only $7.95 for lunch and I got a free drink (or you could choose free fries). Friendly counter folk."}
{"text":"I'd been craving a cheesesteak for the past couple months. Sadly, there isn't a great selection of places to go here in Vegas. I lived a couple years in Philly and everyone knows about Geno's but there are some out of the way places that have great cheesesteak sandwiches. 

Well, Vegas might have finally have an entry. Straight from Philly is a small shop in an out of the way shopping mall. They have about 6 tables. It's clean. I rolled in around 11:10am, was the first and only customer there. Menu has a nice selection of cheesesteaks, burgers, and other selections. Friday is free French fry day. Sign says free ice cream all day everyday. But after eating my cheesesteak I was too full for anything else.

Great sandwich. Lots of meat and cheese. Tender, soft buns. The way a cheesesteak should be. I don't go for mushrooms, onions, or peppers, but they have them...and more toppings (like bacon, mmm). Give it a try and see what you think."}
{"text":"I had driven by a few time finally decided to step in. Small family owned place. In think. Order the south Philly with the wiz. I won't do that again.it might be better without the wiz. Expected more from the onion rings they are not home made so don't expect it. The owner or manager was very nice and very respectful. The Cashier' on the other hand was strange. Not mean but very direct and no real service skills. Either way I went I ate and probably won't go back. It was nothing to write home about. Happy eating everyone."}
{"text":"If greasy, cheesy comfort food is what you want, look no further!

Now I'm not saying this sandwich is dripping with grease, because it's not, but it is a philly cheesesteak so it's not exactly clean eating. I like coming here on Tuesdays because it's \"3 topping Tuesday\"- any 3 toppings for free! I think my favorite toppings are the bell peppers, banana peppers and hot cherry peppers. They're definitely not cheap with the toppings, or the meat for that matter, so this is a pretty filling meal. They also offer free ice cream with any order. There's a big sign in the shop promoting this, but they won't ask if you want ice cream so you must ask about it.  

Both times I've been here, I was the only one in the shop, so service was quick. I had a sandwich in my hand within 10 minutes of ordering. This will continue to be my go spot after long days of studying."}
{"text":"Great friendly service. Great price for the best cheesesteak I have ever had. I'd recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"Amazing !! My hubby is super picky about his food and he and I both loved this place !!! Everything was on point and the staff was very friendly !!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat a philly no joke :) Im seriously addicted to coming here. Fat people problems. lol I usually get the south philly and sometimes when i dont feel like having a cheese steak I order the Gyro , BEST gyro i ever had so far in vegas. What can I say Im a happy customer."}
{"text":"Pretty good cheesesteak.  The meat and cheese were great, but the hoagie roll was just OK.  Overall, very tasty, and I would go back again the next time I'm in Vegas.  Nice people working there.  I hope they do well.  The place was very clean, too."}
{"text":"The food is generally good, but the service is seriously lacking. I came in and ordered two cheesesteaks to go and the employees seemed bothered that I was there. They always seem to be out of toppings that the menu says they offer."}
{"text":"I am just here to let you know this place is out of business. They have a cardboard sign in the window letting you know they closed for business. I drove all the way out there and nothing. Plus the spot seemed dirty and run down. Even if this place was open, I would not have put anything from this shopping center in my mouth.

Update - The owner actually sent me a message. How funny is that? I am entitled to my option just like everyone else. If you don't like what I wrote, too bad. I am from Philly so I am cheesesteak freak. I went out there and it was CLOSED. If you have time to read Yelp reviews, then you have time to let people know you are closed. If I think your business looks like crap and dirty. I can also think that. How about this. Let me know when it is open again and I will alter my review. Until then, it will stay."}
{"text":"Ok....I usually eat here when I can on Thursdays because I work in the area. Made a trip down here yesterday on my day off. Quite the drive but well worth it. Anyway the door was locked as myself and another couple went to go in. As we were walking away they unlocked the door and said they closed early for the holiday weekend. I said \"well damn...that was a drive across town for nothing\" Owner said...you came from across town? Cmon in!! Tried telling him nah..close up enjoy the holiday...he insisted we come in....few more people showed up and I felt bad but they were all in good spirits and served us all with smiles and alot of laughing. Here's to not only the best philly cheesesteak in town but some great ownership and customer service as well!!!"}
{"text":"I can't imagine that this vitriolic comeback was meant to endear themselves in trying to placate a dissatisfied customer. If in fact you did say to my husband that we had an \"outdated menu\" the responsibility of that lies fully with you. We ordered our sandwiches right off of your website, and were not told that the sandwiches had changed. If you would like to debate the point with my much nicer and polite husband that's fine, but his point is that the sandwiches were totally over priced, even if we got what we wanted. Which we didn't. The reason I appeared rude was because I called your place 4 times, hitting re-dial each time, and when someone finally answered asking if I had been helped yet? I said \"No\" and hung up. You can mock me if that's how you want to treat a customer. The irony is, I can be described a hundred different ways, but you will never, ever find rude among the descriptions. I was frustrated, I have never been deliberately rude to anyone in my life, and I'm old! You had a great opportunity to provide exceptional customer service, trying to rectify what was a bad dining experience and yet you opted to make fun of me and blame my husband."}
{"text":"The fries were perfect and the hot sauce is great. Can't really go wrong with any of the cheesesteaks"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband after finding here on Yelp. Ahhhhhmazing! Will definitely be returning soon."}
