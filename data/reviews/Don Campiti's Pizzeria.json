{"text":"The Hype surrounding this place will probably lead to your great disappointment.  We moved in to the neighborhood, and all we heard was Campiti's this Campiti's that, and how it is without a doubt, the best pizza in the Burgh.

So, of course we tried it, and were pretty excited to do so. Now I have lived in several different Pittsburgh neighborhoods, and you always find the pizza you like where you live. Campiti's pizza is not the pizza I like. I wouldn't order a pizza from them again.

Honestly, it was about up to a frozen pizza standard. Now, I'm not saying they are making frozen pizzas, they aren't but, I have even had better frozen pizzas than the pizza we got from Campiti's.

Another reviewer hit the nail on the head saying people who say this is the best pizza around probably have some long running emotional attachment to this place That can be he only logical reason that people actually say it.

{"text":"everything you could want from a pizzeria. I recommend the pizza boats, i get them about once a week and they are always cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Great pie...I could eat a whole large though...if you like a thin crust, you will love this"}
{"text":"One of the best Pizza places in the South Hills. I highly recommend their pizza, it is consistent, delicious and noteworthy the sauce is amazing the dough is always cooked to perfection. Their hoagies are even delicious there is not one thing I do not like on their menu. Wish they delivered, but it is worth the trip to pick up."}
{"text":"Yum for Campiti's! I'm not a pizza fan, meaning I don't rely on pizza every week of my life, but I do appreciate a great tasting pizza, non chain style. Ordered a cheese, and sausage pizza over the weekend to have while the Steelers stunk against the Eagles. The husband ordered an Italian hoagie as well, and went to pick up the order. The pizza comes on a nice, not doughy crust, nicely crispy. The cheese and sauce were evenly distributed, and the sausage pizza was definitely a great tasting pizza. As a non pizza fan, I was impressed with Campiti's pizza, I can't say much about the hoagie since I didn't eat that, but it seemed to be just what was wanted, and was eaten without any complaints. Will definitely order again, even if we have to order wings from another shop."}
{"text":"This place holds a special spot in my stomach heart.

First cheese steak that I ever had, and have yet to find one I enjoy as much as this one. 

Pizza is thin crust and delicious, especially with sausage. I like that they carry Cherokee red, don't see that too much.

Any time I'm nearby, I make it a point to stop, even if I'm gonna be eating it as a midnight snack. They also have frozen pizzas available, which is a better alternative to any other frozen pizza I've had!"}
{"text":"I usually find it difficult to commit to Campiti's with Fiori's right down the road, but I love the fact that they are inexpensive and from my experience, always friendly.

Sauce and cheese are both great but their dough is a little bit thinner which can sometimes result in a crispier dough that isn't my preferred style, but still good."}
{"text":"I grew up in Dormont and thus grew up on Campiti's pizza. This is the greatest pizza shop in the world and I can't wait to get back.....until then my frozen mini camps will have to hold me over."}
{"text":"Aside from the quaint brown paper on cardboard packaging I just can't get into bland sauce on cardboard equivalent crust. I've had better factory pizza at $6 for a large around the block."}
{"text":"I've been eating campitis since I was little and it will probably always be my go to pizza. I love a nice thin crust with a good crunch and that's what you're going to get here. I love their hoagies too. Their bread is always well toasted and not soggy. Definitely my favorite local pizza place"}
{"text":"\"You really drove by Fiori's\", said my cousin when I told him I picked up a pie from Campiti's.

Would I get this pizza again?  Yes.

Will I drive twenty minutes to get this pizza again?  No

I have to say this is a no frills pizza shop, and my pizza was ready to go in 10 minutes both of which I appreciate.  The cheese, sauce, pepperoni, and seasoning were delicious.  These three components are of equal quality, and the sauce may be better than the pizza powerhouses around the city (Mineo's, Fiori's, Doughboy's, Vincint's {while Vincent was still around}), but the crust is terrible.  I love the thinness and crunch of the crust, but there is no doughy-ness to it at all.  My ideal crust is thin and rigid, but once the surface is cracked when you fold it it has a little bit of dough in it.  This did not...I wouldn't say it was like a saltine, but I would say it has frozen pizza qualities.

I liked how it was served in a brown bag  (hate dealing with disposing of pizza boxes).  I also think the pizza reheat well which is an underrated, but necessary component to pizzas."}
{"text":"First, I must preface this review by saying that I moved out of the area 3 years ago.

That said, I still have dreams about Campiti's pizza.

The perfect amount of crust to sauce to cheese ratio, generous toppings, and all around greasy and gooey in every way a pizza should be. Very no fuss pizza, and absolutely delicious. If only they shipped to the west coast!"}
{"text":"Looking for cozy decor, a fun atmosphere, and friendly service? Don't come here.

Looking for a fantastic pizza served fast and for relative cheap? Look nowhere else.

Campiti's is a hole-in-the-wall, formica countered, 70's-paneled, Pepsi menu board behind the cash register kind of place. There's not much seating, the t.v. is a tiny tube job from the 80's, and your pie comes on a piece of cardboard wrapped in a paper bag. 

And the service? Well, they're efficient. They don't care if you like them, they just want to get you your food, and fast. 

But who cares? The reason I make it a personal mission to go to Camps every time I return to Pittsburgh is the pie. It's thin and crisp, yet solid. Nice browning all over. The sauce is a well-seasoned red gravy that provides a tasty base for the copious amounts of mozzarella and whatever other toppings you want. Me, I go for the pepperoni - which is the type that cups up in the oven, forming little pools of fat - and anchovies. 

It's spectacular, and reasonably priced. It is, honest-to-god, my favorite pizza place.

Worth the trip to the South Hills, wherever you start in Allegheny County."}
{"text":"I really like their pizza, very very good.

We stopped and had a pizza and Italian hoagie. The pizza was awesome, I would definitly recommend their pizza.

The environment was very loud, not comfortable for my family because of the loud volume of everything."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Not great. Thin dry crust.  A pizza that has to be eaten quickly to be enjoyed.  Cools off in two minutes.  Clean. Good value for the money. However, much better tasting pizza in many places near by."}
{"text":"Local call this place Camps for short. If u like thin crust pizza , this place is for you . Try  the bacon pizza .. It's fantastic . Cash only place"}
{"text":"As if campitis isn't already amazing, they're now on uber eats, so finally you can get these great hoagies & pizza delivered!!! Great move guys"}
{"text":"I don't know why we never think to get the pizza here but I'm so glad we did! The crust is very light and crispy and they don't drown it in pizza sauce either - the pizza doesn't leave you feeling weighted down, tired and greasy after eating it either.  

Next time I'm trying one with sausage - it sounds like a must try from the other reviews.

Staff is very nice - will be back"}
{"text":"Quality has taken a nosedive since changing hands.  Nothing is as good as it was.  Now it's just crap."}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh from out of town and read the reviews so we decided on Don Campiti's Pizza. Urban Spoon rated 91% favorite. This pizza is not good. Honestly, it tastes like Geno's frozen pizza from the grocery store. The pepperoni was very good. The crust was super thin and tasted like a salteen cracker. I've had much better pizza and will be exploring other options next time I'm in the burg."}
{"text":"Good pizza, very nice folks, and good service

I am new to the area and saw this place on Yelp.  Took the family and we ate in.  Had a very good experience.

The pizza itself is a strong, basic, pizza.  The crust is fairly thin, but not really New York style.  It's slightly doughier than New York, and has a nice \"snap\" of crispness on the very bottom.  The sauce is very traditional red tomato sauce.  It's is not overly spicy, nor is it too sweet.  They were pretty generous with the toppings and the pizza was backed just right - cheese slightly golden.

I will go back to try their hoagies.  I saw one being completed as I was leaving and it looked incredible.  I'll have to go back!"}
{"text":"Disappointed after hearing so many good things. Pizza crust is like a cracker. Hoagie is pretty good, but does not remove the disappointment over the pizza. I think Molly's Pizza next door is a lot better....I won't order from here again."}
{"text":"Pizza is very basic and has no flavor! The crust tastes like flour mixed with water. The sauce was decent, but I would rather eat a frozen Tostino's pizza. We ate it the shop and the staff were really nice and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh.  Moved away a while ago and this is a must do anytime I'm back in the 'Burgh."}
{"text":"Campitis is a favorite childhood pizza spot of my husband's. He raved about the ground sausage they put on their pie. I, being pregnant and on a pizza craving kick, couldn't get in the car fast enough to hop on over to their Dormont location. We ordered a large pie, half pepperoni and sausage and half with just sausage and cheese.  Oh, and an iced tea and a Pepsi (they have cartons/cans available for purchase). The pie came, and although this could feed a family of 3-4 my husband and I demolished it. Yum! Crispy, thin crust and my sausage and pepperoni half was amazing. The ground sausage is just slightly spicy and oh so delicious. There is a small dining room with a tv and my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our pizza. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city..unless you want Sicilian style..then hit Betos. We ordered and inhaled a medium everything pizza and a half steak half Italian hoagie....we should have gotten a large and whole hoagies. Delicious and the pizza was bubbly hot and fresh out of the oven. I didn't mind waiting as the guys behind the counter were friendly, funny and genuinely fun to talk too. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the hoagies could use a little more meat on them...but still yummy! Pizza crust is perfect...not too thin, not to thick and crunchy. I can't wait til our next Camps night!!"}
{"text":"People really are nuts about their pizza in the 'burgh - this I'm learning. 

I ordered a pizza from here because it's in my hood (walking distance, even) and because someone told me it's been their favorite pizza since they were wee little. I think a lot of places in Pit have false-yum status because people are just emotionally attached to things they've eaten for so many years... I don't fault them for that, but this just isn't great pizza, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Raised as a Camp's Fan!

My family comes from the South Hills Area then moved down to Washington Pa. Since i was little at least once a month we would drive to Camp's for pizza and hoagies.  I now work in this area and date someone from there so i have tried many pizzas around here.  if your looking for good cheesie yummieness go for Fiori's but  if u want great, not as greasy, quality toppings, Campiti's is the place!"}
{"text":"Had the best experience tonight! We've been to the bethel park one but never dormont. Tonight we tried dormont.. same great pizza, same great service. They even gave me an extra pizza someone else had ordered wrong by accident. Can't love them enough!!!"}
{"text":"Really great place to get pizza and hoagies.  The workers inside are always hustling around and do a great job.  

This place has my favorite Italian hoagie in the Pittsburgh area.  Something about the bread and dressing the use here is just different and better than other places.  They also have pretty good pizza."}
{"text":"I First Met Don in 1973 when I ordered my first Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza.

Don use to work the counter himself and was always a very customer service kinda guy.

I really miss him , but I'll never miss this Pizza cause I'll ALWAYS be a customer.

As far as rateing , this place will be on my TOP 5 till I die."}
{"text":"I will never forget Campiti's. As a youngster growing up playing on Potomac Avenue and Dormont. My favorite pizza was and still is Campiti's. I have not found an equal in the 18 years I have been in CA. The hoagies were pretty damn good too."}
{"text":"Although not a large joint and with a very limited menu, Campiti's Pizza offers up some really delicious food.  Fast service and friendly staff makes the visit all the better.  The place seems clean which is always a big plus. I highly recommend a visit when you're in the area."}
{"text":"I can definitely appreciate a local spot that does extremely well. That is the reason I decided to check them out. However, their pizza crust is very crunchy and I myself like soft/chewy crust. The only thing I very much enjoyed on the pizza was the excellent crumbled sausage topping. The Italian hoagie was also very good. 

I would be back for the hoagie, but not so much for pizza!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town , very thin crust , great sauce , fresh toppings !!! Alway great!!!! Happy"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful spot in the heart of old Pittsburgh.   Wonderful food.  We had the pepperoni and sausage with Cherrikee Red soda. Paired perfectly. It's worth the drive to come here.  We're from Florida and a friend suggested this place.  So glad we came. Wonderful owner and staff."}
{"text":"This place is some of my favorite pizza anywhere in the US.  This place is delicious and the pizza is top notch! Love the smaller pepperonies and the crumbled sausage.  The hoagies are delicious too, but I'd suggest getting it with out lettuce or on the side, nothing nastier than warm lettuce!"}
{"text":"Pizza was absolutely great. We enjoyed the smell and taste was good. The crust is hard but taste good. I really enjoy this pizza I would really recommend this pizza place, if you are not a fan of high end pizza joints. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for Fiori's, this would be the best pizza in Pittsburgh

The crust is super super thin, so if you're not into that it might not be the pizza for you.  But the sauce is great and so is the cheese. 

Hoagies are awesome too.  I like the steak which comes with Italian dressing. The Italian hoagie is pretty good too, but I prefer the steak. 

This is a take out pizza place. Don't waste your time dining in and expect to have five star waiters and service. This isn't the place for that."}
{"text":"This place does not accomodate people with food allergies.  I am highly allergic to iceberg lettuce and made that clear upon ordering. Long story short , after i stated that i do NOT want iceberg lettuce on my hoagie they not only put it on anyhow but eventually refused to give me my money back. I have not gone back and refuse to go there ever again."}
{"text":"Campiti's is family owned. They recently (in the last couple of years) changed owners, which has brought a few changes to the restaurant itself and a little change to the taste of the pizza and sauce. They now except debit/credit cards. They have a small dining room, big enough for smaller parties and dinner dates. The pizzas are good. The sauce is on the sweeter side. The pizza is served very hot and the crust is crunchy, so be careful (I cut the top of my mouth every time). The prices are good for both the pizza and hoagies. I hear the hoagies are very good, but haven't tasted one yet because the smell of the pizzas gets me every time! Their bevi's are sold per can, two liter or 6 packs of soda. They also have available for sale, frozen pizzas to heat up  in the comfort of your own home!"}
{"text":"This is the pizza I cut my first tooth on as a kid.  It will always be my standard measure for greatness in pizza.  Come enjoy and explore Dormont."}
{"text":"Not my kind of pizza. I know plenty of people who love this place, but to me it tasted like a stale saltine with tomato paste on top. My theory is that the people who love it grew up on it, so maybe it's a nostalgia thing? I only had it once tho so maybe it was just an off night.... or the recipe has changed? But I'll give it another chance."}
{"text":"To put it frankly, Campitis is the place to get pizza and hoagies.  I've been going here since I was a kid and will always go here... as long as I can.  The atmosphere and the pizza are as good as it gets.  Campitis defines \"hometown pizza\" and, to be honest, it's some of the best pizza I've ever had (including during my international travels).  It's thin, light, and the sauce is perfect.  My recommendation is to combine it with a half Italian hoagie and you have one heck of a meal!  Salads are simple, but also great.  And for the price, you absolutely cannot beat it.  If you haven't been here yet, you're missing out."}
{"text":"I've been eating Campiti's Pizza most of my life. I love it. Fresh ingredients. Thin Crust. Perfectly made. Just the best. Try the sausage pizza which is unlike any that you have had. 

Also their baked Italian Hoagies are great too. 

People around here are mostly split on Camp's or Fiori's . To me it isn't even close. Fiori's is cardboard compared to how good this is. My humble opinion."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY!

In the Potomac Avenue Pizza Wars, there are but two combatants; Molly's and Campiti's. And they are at a stalemate.

When you get takeout from Campiti's, your pizza will come on a cardboard disc and will be placed in a paper bag. Be mindful of this. Fortunately, the pie survived the short trip home last night, and a crack, tidy pie it was. The crust was thin yet sturdy and gave the teeth a workout at the edges. A \"saltine\" cracker doesn't describe it at all, however.  Nor did the pizza taste like a frozen Geno's abortion. C'mon. Do you people have fun writing these whiny, inaccurate reviews?  The cheese was tangy, slippery like a Steve Vai axe solo, the pepperoni curled into small cups of meaty love, and the sauce acted as a masterly, pungent focal point. Campiti's makes a pizza that is just as excellent as Molly's, but at the same time is greatly dissimilar. Try them both and compare/contrast for yourselves. Hopefully, they'll both be around long enough to develop their own Mineo's/Aiello's-style rivalry. 

The hoagie was merely adequate and skimped a bit on the meat. 

After finally getting to try Campiti's, I am left with  no regrets. I've been told that Campiti's has a cult surrounding it. Based on the pizza I had, I can clearly see why as each slice inculcated my taste buds like a psychoactive drug administered by a charismatic leader with penchant for soaring rhetoric. Fortunately, I am strong-willed and thus was able to resist falling into...its trance. Is it a magnificent pizza, the best ever made? No. Is it a very good one? Absolutely. 

Bring on the mob of cloaked Campiti's disciples and their ceremonial daggers. *snikt* Bub. 

P.S. The guy who waited on me was far from a jagoff. I know jagoffs, plenty of 'em. He is not among their ranks."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. I am taking off one star cause the guys who work there are, as the locals say, \"jagoffs.\""}
{"text":"Camp's has a cult following.   As soon as you walk in you can smell the melting mozzarella.  Love that smell.  W grew up on Camp's and is almost in the cult, so we go to Camp's from time to time.  It has been a real long time since our last visit so it was fun to stop back in.  

The crust is a medium thickness, not to thin and not to thick, and somewhat crunchy.  One friend calls it almost like a biscuit, I really don't get that, but it is a little chewy and just a little brown around the edge.  One thing that I notice is they do not overload the pizza with sauce and toppings like some places.  Enjoyed our pizza and will be back.  Have had the hoagie in the past and if I remember correctly, it is very good."}
{"text":"Couldn't be more disappointed. Worse than frozen pizza, but wait, the hoagie was garbage too. Who serves a pizza in a damn bag? Staff was nice and that warrants them two stars. Will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Compared to the original Don Campiti Pizza of the 60's and 70's this is not even close. The legacy of a superior pizza in Dormont has lost it. No longer up there with Beto's and area best. Sad to say this pizza was so bad. I have been a diehard customer of the 60's and 70's. Crust was like cardboard. Toppings were worse. What happened to the legacy Don Campitis Pizza ?

Update: Under new ownership, making great progress
Rating considerably improved. Give them a shot. :-)"}
{"text":"I just ate a cheese pizza there and was disappointed. It had very little flavor. The crust was also off and a tad burnt. Maybe I came on a bad night or got a dud. 

I have to say, the presentation looked really cool as the pizza came in a paper grocery bag instead of a regular-issue rectangular box. It's also thin-crust pizza, but not like shit-Dominos thin. Maybe that's why I couldn't get into it. There's a pizza place in Michigan (Fricanos) which has the best thin crust in the country and they put everyone else to shame."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for many years but never really had the opportunity to try it until today. I was very pleased with the pizza very good I haven't had a thin crust like that in a long time. Awesome toppings, they have those cool little pepperonis . Quick service. My only quarrel is weak menu, i guess keeping it simple, makes it easy. I'll update you when I try the one in Bethel Park! BONUS:They have cans of Cherokee Red how cool is that?"}
