{"text":"I went to Tomo with a very large group (around 18 folks, we had a reservation). Things didn't start out so good...the manager wanted all of us to pay cash because he didn't want to split the checks! After we explained that none of us had brought cash (seriously, who pays with cash anymore?) he left for a bit, and then came back and said we could split the check. So, I believe they were just being lazy, since they ended up splitting the check anyway. If they had wanted us to pay with cash, they should have informed us when we made the reservations! Poor management. Overall the serves did a good job though after this incident. 

Moving along to the food. The green tea was unlike other green tea that I have had. It had a nutty taste to it that I didn't care for. Perhaps that is more authentic? I don't know, but it wasn't what I was expecting, and didn't drink it. The miso soup was excellent and brought out fairly quickly. Hubby and I shared the gyoza and the spider sushi. The gyoza was crunchy, but not too crunchy, and came in a boat. Nice presentation. The sushi was good too. Nothing out of this world, but good. Another person with us had a noodle dish that looked great. It had scallops, mussels, and shrimp. I didn't try it though, so can't say for sure. And the hot sake was great. Always good to have hot sake with my sushi. And to finish it all off...the green tea ice cream. Now this was delicious, and my favorite part of the evening! Nice and creamy, not overly sweet, but just sweet enough. 

Bottom line: Don't go with large groups unless you have cash, sushi is ok, but the green tea ice cream is worth the trip."}
{"text":"I found this place by accident its in a strip mall with AT&T and some time to wait for my phone so went over to eat lunch! I had the Chicken Teryiaki Bowl which was a very large portion and very tasty. The atmosphere is very pleasant and a little on the darker side but we enjoyed it! They have a large selection of cocktails as well.The service was very good and will go back to try the sushi next time."}
{"text":"This place is like an old flame. You know why you swore to never go back but you end up returning because, while not good, it's also not totally horrible. The service is meh, the food is edible, and the prices are decent but there's really nothing that keeps me coming back except for the fact that it's close, so its got that going for it."}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant.  The place has a good feel and the sushi is fresh and good.  The service is fast and friendly.  Recommended for any one who love sushi."}
{"text":"Good food .... But the worst service I've ever had .... If you don't ask for service you won't get it"}
{"text":"good happy hour prices. boyfriend had sashimi and tempura....i had a veggie roll...very good. mango cocktail was soooo yummy."}
{"text":"Good stuff. A neighborhood spot that I appreciate. Sit at the bar and meet new people. Don't be scared. I very much enjoyed Tomo."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, good portions, surprisingly cheap price for what we got! They are very friendly servers and the atmosphere is very good and relaxing. I went during lunch right after school and it was very satisfying of sushi food. I have never had any issues with this place and never plan to. Keep going strong Tomo!"}
{"text":"We met our waitress twice, once to take our order and once to bring us our iced tea, after that another waitress brought our food out. We were halfway thru our food when we(my family of 3) finished our drinks ,  but our waitress was nowhere to be found, so we stopped eating and waited patiently for 10 mins for her to come back, yet she never made it back.  So, of course our table was in the middle,  right by the cash register with every server in the restaurant walking by and the Manager standing there with out a single greeting or can we help you with something.  By this time of course our server never came to even bring us the bill, so I had to walk up asking for the bill. When I got the bill to pay the Manager of course he ACCEPTED MY PAYMENT without asking how everything was even though he clearly seen half our meal was not eaten with empty drink cups. That answered my question of why my waitress was not attentive to us, because Cleary the Manager was not doing his job. It's a shame that a Japanese Cuisine like that has good sushi chefs without good supporting staff. This is why I chose to complain on yelp about the terrible service that we received on 01/07, because the Manager did see the frustration in my eyes and chose to take my money instead of asking how I was doing."}
{"text":"Very bad in flexibility for choosing the sides. You have to get the sides that come with the meal then order the sides you wanted separately. They will not let you exchange even three sides with one side of rice. I don't like it at all!"}
{"text":"We love this place! We're there just about every Friday night...it's close to our home and the sushi is yummy....always fresh and they are accomodating of all my \"special orders\" (I'll admit I'm somewhat of a high maintenance order-er).  If you're out in the West Valley, give Tomo a chance. It's the best sushi we've found...enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in one of Phoenix's many generic stripmalls, Tomo is truly a gem.  Reasonably priced and delicious, this establishment offers amazing lunch specials with generous portions and daily happy hour specials.  The service isn't overly friendly (but what do you expect from an authentic sushi joint?), but the food is served promptly and freshly prepared.

The Snow Corn and Phoenix rolls are phenomenal, and the 12 piece chef's special sashimi is an amazing deal (and delicious too!)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here when I am actually acknowledged when I come in. I can't believe I keep trying to give this place a shot. Today my husband and I walked out for the third and final time. The wait for a server to come to us on average has been 15-20 minutes. The wait for the tab up to 30 minutes. It's a shame really because we live down the street and desperately want to be be frequent customers but I cannot justify it longer. The management/service is probably the worst I have seen in the food industry. I'm not a negative yelper EVER, ho ahead and look, but I am doing this to help the biz out. I do not expect a response because I mean, they don't even care in person, but should somehow someone tell me that there's new management, I may consider dropping by solely for the food. Good luck Tomo!"}
{"text":"the bento is nice! love the tempura and California rolls..salad is refreshing! the price is worth the meal...will come back again if I'm around this area (:"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, the place is clean and quiet. Friendly staff, and great food. We only had a small issue with it not being happy hour and being told it was happy hour. So we ordered from what we were told was the happy hour items, but when the bill came it didn't show as happy hour. So we had to pay full price. Other than that, The food was great, nonetheless. Will come back."}
{"text":"We used to be regulars at tomo because the food and happy hour prices are really good but the continuously horrible service is going to put them out of business. We have given them so many chances to redeem themselves but every time we've been the service has gotten worse not better. Last week was the last straw, we were seated at the sushi bar and sat there for literally 15 minutes without anyone even coming to offer us water. The restaurant was not excessively busy and at least 3 waitresses made eye contact with us then immediately turned around. We walked out. We have ordered sushi along with other food in the past and the sushi rolls have came out so long after the rest of the meal you don't even want them anymore. I can't say enough bad things about the service here which is sad because tomo was a really good place to go for happy hour. Save your time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved going to this restaurant while we were living in Glendale, AZ.  We have moved out of state, and now really miss this restaurant.  The service is very friendly and their sushi is amazing!  We have not had a bad roll there.  :)

In my opinion, best sushi restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"I personally don't eat sushi, but their Teriyaki Chicken dinner is really good.  They have  pretty cheap beer, it's a pretty nice place (at least inside), and service has usually been pretty decent."}
{"text":"Great sevice!!! Nice setting, and affordable. Definately will be back"}
{"text":"Awesome food, that's the only reason I keep coming back. Great happy hour menu HOWEVER, horrible service! :( Everytime I have been here (because I am writing this as I wait for my food) everytime it takes ages for me to get my food and there is always something wrong with my order. The appetizer was brought to me at the end instead of the beginning. Bad bad bad restaurant management everytime."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Our favorite sushi place in the West Valley. The monkey balls are amazing and my favorite roll is the Superman roll. That being said, we have yet to order a roll that we didn't like - combinations are great and the ingredients are fresh. Everything is prepped to order, so it takes a little while to get your order - but it's worth the wait. Yum!!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend going to Tomo service is terrible bartender yells at the customers the bathrooms were absolutely filthy."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Nice ambiance. I feel the staff could have been slightly more attentive. But the food was great!"}
{"text":"This is what I've been looking for! Real authentic fresh Japanese food!! Not Americanized! All the sushi mi was soooo fresh! It Absolutely melted in your mouth!! Great service in a clean comfortable environment. Terrific!"}
{"text":"Great little hidden spot for Japanese cuisine fix and sake bombs. Japanese Ramen :) Shhhh I'm busy dranking and watching football. Servers are nice, need to know the menu themselves and the difference between the noodles."}
{"text":"This place is great. I have been been twice in the the past two weeks for happy hour so I'm not sure why it shows as closed here on yelp. They have some decent drink specials and the asian wings beat Buffalo WW's asian zing hands down! As far as the happy hour menu goes, there is a good selection of sushi rolls to choose from.  The service was somewhat lacking on both visits, but this place is close and delish so I will likely return."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not as great as it seems. I've been here many times and have noticed a variety of horrible things that management does to their employees. During some very busy rushes there was only one waiter and one busser for the entire restaurant. I felt horrible for the busser because she was having to do jobs that were in the waiter job description while at the same time still being a busser. Also while doing both of those jobs being the hostess at the door. At one point she was cleaning a table for the customers at the door while getting yelled at for not being at the door. What kind of manager treats their employees like this. Especially when they are working hard for them. We talked to the girl later after the rush died down and upon asking her a few questions we found out that the bussers at their restaurant work more than the waiters, do all of the jobs of the restaurant, yet only get paid to buss tables. They get tips but only if the managers think that they deserve it from that day. We talked to a few waiters also and they all told us that they felt extremely overwhelmed seeing as how they're weren't enough waiters and bussers to take care of the needs of the restaurants yet the managers don't seem to care. One time we even noticed the managers drinking on the job. I was horrified! How does this place stay in business! We tried talking to the managers about it and they just shut down. We pulled a worker aside and asked her to be honest with us about how she felt about working there and she told us all the employees get along really well but are miserable working there. The entire kitchen staff is illegal, they smoke marijuana in the kitchen around the food, the kitchen staff touches the underage young girls that work there and make them very uncomfortable and the manager did nothing about it when they went to him about it. The young lady told us they even take their tips sometimes! I am dumbfounded by how the police haven't raided this place yet! I feel terrible for the employees and hope the best for all of them. Do not go to this place and support these terrible managers and practices!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always thought the food was okay. Not bad but not terrible. Came here for lunch today and the food was not good. 

The reason for 1 star? 20 minutes after leaving the restaurant my bf and I had food poisoning. 

The bf had chicken teriyaki and I had one of the lunch combo box. 

If you still want to eat here, good luck!"}
{"text":"I ate here once and loved it, came back and not so great .. came back and not so great ..service was bad and food was bad. The rolls fell apart. And I waited over a half hour for a simple mixed drink. Mann, bummed cuz I thought my go to sushi restaurant. . Guess back to the search"}
{"text":"Pretty decent japanese food ... 
The roll are A-OK .... nothing more special than your regular california roll 

However I was delightfully surprised by the qualify of their fish .... salmon nigiri and the uni (sea urchin) are exceptional fresh ... 
Service is slow but still acceptable ... won't walk out the door for that ... will stay put for my fresh fish :)
Enjoy"}
{"text":"Their happy hour is awesome the prices are wonderful for this area. Food is great anyone going will be very happy they also have happy hour for drinks as well as their sushi rolls take advantage of both"}
{"text":"I give the food 4 stars but the service is a 1 star. It was awful. I think this is a good place for take out, not sit down."}
{"text":"Who knew that you could find good sushi in Goodyear?? I was pleasantly surprised by Tomo Japanese. I had a \"Dream Roll\" and a shrimp tempura thing that i forgot the name of. They were both very good. The Dream Roll was a salmon/avacado roll that was really good. The salmon was very fresh and the kind that just melts in your mouth. This place is on par with Zen 32, my most favorite sushi spot in  Phoenix. 
The atmosphere and service were both very good. My sushi took a bit longer than expected to show up, but it was worth the wait. I'll definitely  be back to Tomo!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad, however the service makes it difficult to want to return...every time I have have come here it takes me grabbing a staff member to even get a drink. The food is decent though, so I return. Happy hour menu is full of great prices and appetizers which is typically what I order anyway. If they could get a little more organized as far as staff goes it would go far. I also would love seaweed in my miso please lol patience required to dine here. Overall, I shall return!"}
{"text":"I love this spot for the food and atmosphere.  I take my family here often for their happy hour menu.  If your looking for fabulous service you may or may not get it.  In my opinion, the food and prices are worth the wait.  But the food and friendliness of the staff is worth your time."}
{"text":"Went during the lunch hour (not happy hour).  Food quality was gpod at 3/5 stars.  Nothing really special stuck out.  Pretty much what i would expect.  Service was fast and friendly.  They get 4 out of 5 for not recommending or suggesting.  The reason for the low score was the price.  The Sushi Combo A includes 14 pcs of chef picked pieces.  For $20 I expected more then a California Roll and your standard inagi pieces.  Not very special.  Except for the price, this is your typical Sushi house.  

Happy hour may be different and possibly why the rest the time prices are so high"}
{"text":"Pookie was our server, she was awesome, full of personality and bubbly, offering miso soup on the house which was amazing. I ordered a spicy tuna hand roll, spicy yellowtail handroll, and a spicy tuna roll, all of which are my go-to items at a sushi restaurant. Not only did the food not taste that fresh, three hours later I am now vomiting clear liquid nonstop after all the rolls have came up. Food poisoning is no laughing matter, I will never go here again."}
{"text":"This was by far the WORST service and food I've ever had. I don't understand how people said it was amazing. I guess that's what happens when you go to a place that serves fish and you're no where near the ocean."}
{"text":"Sushi is pretty decent and not horribly overpriced. We have only done take out and both times we have allowed more than the quoted time for it to be ready but still had to wait at least 20 minutes for our food to be ready when there was no one in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love the sushi..dislike the service.. Been going to Tomo for 5years.. I finally accepted the service was bad after the third time I visited the place YEARS ago. It's definitely consistent on the so-so service, some days are better than others..But I keep coming back because it's great food. The servers are not rude but they have no personality and forget go check up on you sometimes. On the upside..have not been to Nakama which is 2 min drive from Tomo.. So I suppose that says a lot about Tomos sushi.. ;-)"}
{"text":"We waited 20 minutes and finally got our waters. Then waited another 20 and our server never came back to take our order. They were all standing around talking so we threw a 10 on the table and walked out and went to Hayashi. We were seated and served right away! Don't waste your time at TOMO"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the area.  Fish is fresh and food/drinks are cheap.  Place is kind of small so come early to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"The horrible service here ruins the food! Don't waste your time coming here to be ignored and treated rudely. They definitely need better, more experienced  waitresses and kitchen staff."}
{"text":"The food keeps me coming back.  Great sushi menu.  Always fresh and appealing.

The exceptional food overrides the mediocre wait staff.  They are always friendly polite, and the food service is timely.   But, the wait staff definitely lacks the expected service skills, like clearing your table between courses, making sure you have everying you need, and checking on back from time to time to see if you need anything else.  Chances are they would sell more alcohol, appetizers and desserts if they put forth a little effort.  The first time I ate here I thought it was an isolated incident, but have since found it's the norm.  

Quality service is one of the key things that makes me decide where to eat, but I have to say that the food at Tomo's is worth the service shortfalls."}
{"text":"Very good sushi at a decent price.  Our server was very lousy and we had to keep telling her things that she forgot.  The owner was there and picking up her slack and was super cool to us.  I would definitely go back I just hope we have a different server:)  Saki Bombs!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible.   When sushi smells fishy you know its not fresh. I hope I don't get food poisoning later since my stomach is upset already. Service was terrible also.   Maybe my expectations are too high dince I am Japanese and know good sushi.   Lucky for them there is not another sushi place in the area or they would be out of business."}
{"text":"I like the food here a lot. Dysart roll is really good, but service is consistently terrible. Any time of day. Busy or not."}
{"text":"In the past two years I've been coming here, food quality and taste has certainly gone down - and service is absolutely pathetic, borderline non-existent.

If you'd like a waiter or waitress who seats you, eventually takes your order, and then doesn't bother to check up on you or even fill your drinks until it's time to pay up, this is the place to go!

Otherwise, better start looking for a new sushi place."}
{"text":"LOVE this place...they have an amazing happy hour! The sushi is the best that I have found in the valley, we love to meet friends here and can end up staying for hours. If you are looking for a good spot to have CONSISTENTLY good sushi and service....try out TOMO"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Great happy hour specials!  Clueless waitresses but awesome chefs!"}
{"text":"This place is great, very clean and prompt service. We came during lunch and got our drinks right away, fish is fresh and very well proportioned. We really enjoyed the red devil roll. We will be back!"}
{"text":"As of 3/29/15 I have been to this place 3 times. Every time, it was excellent service and sushi! My regular spot was recently closed down and I have been searching for a new sushi spot to call home. This place has booths, tables and you can also sit at the sushi bar. The main reason I like this place is because it is dimmed lighting. I do not prefer bright places when I am eating. I like a dimmed light and cozy place to enjoy my food. My favorite roll here is the Arizona roll. It has a little jalapeno kick to it! Service here is great. They take care of you and then leave you to enjoy your food. They do not hover and I love that. OK OK OK, I guess I have found my new sushi spot! YAYYY!"}
{"text":"Had started going to Tomo when they had first opened.  Eventually weened ourselves away from the place because at the time it seemed that the service was not quite the same and we're real sticklers about that kind of thing.  Once we've had bad experience at a place usually don't go back.  Well we did decide to try Tomo again after the other place we found really began to suck and we are glad we did.

Service has been great and they seem to have a much larger selection to choose from.  Usually sit at the sushi bar, like to watch them making everything.  When you sit there you get this great little salad of lettuce, cucumber and julienned carrots with this flavorful dressing.  You also get a bowl of miso soup.  Then the rolls start coming and yum, yum, yum.

If you have room for dessert after getting your sushi fix on, you need to try one of the tempura ice creams.  It's a ball of ice cream, they have different flavors to choose from, coated with tempura batter, quickly deep fried, then presented on the plate quartered with whipped cream and chocolate drizzle.  What a way to spend the evening."}
{"text":"Went for my first time on Friday night with my family started off rocky because I got no help from any of the servers at all. But a young blonde lady who sat us helped us a lot. I believe she said her name was Alexis. Anytime she was free or even busy she always came with a smile and very nice willing to help and get us anything we needed and she was fast.need more workers like her. Will be returning with my family again. Food was great too."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time, but recently moved to Utah and nothing there compares. We are in town for the holiday and made a 45 minute trip out of our way just to eat here again. Great food and service. Every time we are close we we will come back."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Tomo. They are my favorite sushi place here in this area. The service I have had is always very good and the sushi is so fresh and flavorful. The rice is buttery and well seasoned. It's delicate and that is what I enjoy. I always order more traditional sushi because I don't like Americanized, cream cheese, fried \"psuedo-sushi\". They always have great eel and the newer \"Emerald\" roll is so delicious. It has cilantro on top which really makes the taste pop. They have very good vegetable tempura. It was a shock to have such light crispy batter and tender pumpkin. Usually Americanized places have over battered or the items are greasy. The sake bombs are always such a great deal during happy hour. I recommend this to anyone who would like to try a friendly, quite, dark little place with very good food."}
{"text":"Great, attentive, and quick service. The food was very good and the atmosphere is the nicest we have found in the west valley."}
{"text":"Great service with good quality food. The chicken in the chicken teriyaki was grilled and plenty of teriyaki sauce. Ample servings, great atmosphere and definitely to return again."}
{"text":"Goood sushi and good service everytime i go !!!"}
{"text":"Bad buinesse online says they close 10 pm I walked threw the door 9:25 and was told they where closed they must have all the money and don't need mine and I'll make sure I'll never go back theres a couple other sushi places in Goodyear who will take my buinesse  35 mins before closing time!! Ps I'm a big eater and you just lost!!!! I wish I didn't have to give you any stars !!!"}
{"text":"I travel for work around the country and this is a great cheaper sushi place. They have a Ton of choices which typically means it is not good and specialized. However this place does well on all the rolls. The Jackpot is a great roll and ditto for the ninja.  Also service is great"}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Az hands down. I have been coming to this place for 8 years and have yet to have better sushi anywhere. If you want fresh sushi with a large variety of rolls you won't find a better place. My personal favorite is the Emerald Roll."}
{"text":"Seems like people have been complaining about slow service. I usually only notice that on incredibly busy nights. Which if you have any common sense you should know its going to take a while to get to everyone if you only have 2 servers running a fully packed floor. Patience people or simply get up and go some where else lol. 

Anyway besides that, the owner, that cat is mad cool. Props to you Bryan you've done great things with Tomo. Easily the best sushi in the area. If you're super far south west in goodyear avondale area and you want sushi. Tomo is the top choice."}
{"text":"Nice place. Great atmosphere.  Not pretentious,  just good food.  It's now on my short list of places to go in the west valley."}
{"text":"Wow. Worst food poisoning of my life. Ate here Saturday night for my birthday. Started to just not feel right about 20 minutes afterward. Sunday I never left the bed except to go be sick. I lost a full FIVE pounds in one day. Stay away from the salmon. I for one will never go back. I'm really sad too because I decided on it from the reviews. Another reviewer said they were disappointed in the recent quality. I should have listened!!"}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken sux 

Spicy ramen = instant noodles standard

My friends like to come here and I seriously dunno y...."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time the other night...I'd heard good things. It was very busy went we got there, but they were able to seat us quickly. The menu is pretty good if you like sushi, they have plenty of options. We also got some not sushi items and they came out great, very tasty.

The service was a little strange, we seemed to have three or four waitresses come by and ask us if we were ready to order, the first came after we had literally been sitting for 30 seconds...fine for drink order, but give me few to look at the menu. Felt a little rushed.

Overall I would recommend, good portions and the service has quirks but not terrible."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. Easily the best sushi in the West Valley. Tuna sashimi is great. This time also had shrimp tempura and California rolls which were very good. They do have an issue with service and have changed help so many times that we no longer know most of the staff. We had to ask server for wasabi and ginger! But for the service I would have rated them a 5"}
{"text":"Very good Japanese food and nice environment. I ordered the chicken cutlet, the portion was large and very tender and tasted great with the sweet-sour dipping sauce for the cutlet."}
{"text":"Great sushi!  Service is good every time we go.  Thanks to Tomo's great quality food and cool atmosphere, even my teenage kids love to eat sushi now.  We have eaten at at least 6 or 7 different places for sushi and this is easily one of the most consistently delicious."}
{"text":"I have been relying on a buffet to satisfy my hunger for Sushi.  My family decided to try this place the other night and I went back for more the next day.  The restaurant felt very clean and the staff was very helpful.  Family of four spend $50 on lunch which was a bit more than we typically spend but we will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Tomo was one of the first sushi places out here in the West Valley...way before it was cool to go eat sushi :P They have had consistently good food and decent service throughout the years. Happy Hour prices are good too! Tomo is a solid place to go if you're in the mood for sushi!"}
{"text":"This is the place I go to for sushi. It gets really busy here and sometimes they forget to bring your order. But friendly, clean, and modern  environment."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for several years.. I think this is the best and best priced sushi in the west valley. I love yellow tail sashimi and it's always consistent. Very buttery, fresh and just melts in your mouth. I've had most their sushi and its pretty fresh most of the time. My go-to sushi place here on this side of town. Note: Service is on and off. They do have their bad days but the owner is great.. Other than that.. I would recommend this restaurant for all sushi lovers."}
{"text":"I came here with my brother for lunch. 

The good:
The service. Polite, prompt, and aware if the food service was slow. 

The okay: bento box prices aren't bad and have good combinations: sashimi and short ribs are nice together. My brother got this. Ribs were a bit chewy. Tuna sashimi was bright red which is a good sign. 

The not so great: I ordered two rolls, a dragon and a Philadelphia roll. At other places the Philadelphia is small and simple. It was massive (because half the roll was rice) but unfortunately the salmon was not fresh. 

I would go here if I am too lazy to drive to Glendale for Tokyo Lobby and HAD TO HAVE sushi. Otherwise I would just eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great food! I don't usually write reviews but I have to give them props. The food is great and the waitress leaves us alone to enjoy our meal :) I'm not bothered with silly questions while i'm dining and enjoying the company of my date (wife usually). The wifi is free from Panda Express next door so I can upload a pic of my food onto Facebook and not have to use my limited data which is so costly with AT&T."}
{"text":"The best sushi and sashimi in the Valley.   I have been all over the East Valley trying sushi joints out and nothing compares and especially for lunch.  Tomo's bento lunches are amazing and are very affordable.  I love me some Tomo's."}
{"text":"Took a star off for pricing, the decor is nice  but it seems that in order to confiscate for the high priced interior design they had to up the sushi prices.

Let's start with the calamari. It's a little more chewy and it's battered in tempura batter and served with a dipping sauce, which consisted of soy sauce and vinegar. Overall very good.

The roll itself in the bento box consisted of deep fried shrimp and imitation crab meat then covered in tempura batter bits. Overall good.

The short ribs in the bento box started off good, but where there weren't bones it was super dry and chewy. 

The box also came with what looked and tasted like a round slice of potato, which was deep fried. Kind of mushy, this I didn't like. Maybe just a filler?

The tempura part of the bento box only came with one shrimp then a couple carrots and one broccoli and some sweet potato slices. The carrot was a bit undercooked along with the sweet potato.

The side salad on both the bento and the Katsu curry chicken was a vinigary light dressing with wasabi mixed into it. I didn't like this , because I don't like the taste of wasabi. Lol they should have at least a house dressing then a special dressing.

The Katsu curry was a bit dry and overcooked. 

Overall I wish they'd give you a side of rice with the bento,maybe since most customers aren't Asian?

Doesn't make sense. All I know is this isn't truly authentic Japanese food. Coming from Korean descent and having a Japanese step dad. 

The special rolls is what will take the most $. Prices ranging $10.95 and up. For just a few pieces of sushi, basically one roll. They just look fancy but all they consist of are the fake salmon egg, maybe spicy mayo sauce and green onions to jazz 
It up. Took one star off for pricing and not so good quality."}
{"text":"I love the oyshi roll and snow corn I've been a big fan of this place for couple of years and the atmosphere is great I recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. The sushi is always fresh and delicious so this is my favorite place to get sushi and other Japanese dishes. They have great authentic delicious Ramen Noodle dishes. The Service can be a bit spotty depending on when you go and who you get."}
{"text":"Fabulous rolls and can't beat the happy hour prices. Service used to be a little slow, but has gotten much better lately. The bento boxes are great and love the katsu!"}
{"text":"definitely a fan of this place!!"}
{"text":"I'm from the bay & visiting family when I had a japenese food craving. The atmosphere was great, the prices excellent & the food superb. The monkey balls & udon were delicious. Service was prompt. I will definitely eat here when I visit again!"}
{"text":"Somewhere between your popular established Sushi restaurant and those elite, \"no-sign\" outside real deal sushi temples, mostly in places like LA and NYC...There is the local gem that is \"Tomo\".   

Let's put it this way. It is my very first Yelp. I've been a Yelp fan, even had a Yelp account for quite sometime now. But. I'm about to go to Tomo in a few minutes with family and -- For their Happy Hour which is amazing. and Dare I say \"Daily\". I felt compelled to 'Yelp' for the very first time. 

This my friends, is the hippest non-chain sushi place that Rocks it in food, creativity and atmosphere. 

Oh, and did I mention the HH daily...daily from 3-6..with inexpensive libations, including generous $2/$4 Japanese beers during HH-- they give you the entire bottle with a frosted glass (sometimes but who the heck cares, the entire bottle of Asahi or whatever your mouth buds desire to go with the delish sushi selections. 

Did I say delish? Yes. Yes, I did and may I add - Diverse. 

The Coup-de-Gras combo of a sushi joint or anyplace for that matter - is to master both a large plethora of offerings AND get each and every offering to taste right on and not to taste all alike. Check and check. 

Primo = Tomo. 

The portions, freshness, the fish to rice ratio and presentation, plus taste and variety - sooo dang good.

At other sushi spots, unless it really sucks, typically you'll dip your goods in your wasabi/lowsalt sodium concoction, swirl, chomp and are generally satiated.

But at Tomo's -- you cannot be satiated, you're like one of those Pirates of the Caribbean ghosts, cursed because, even though you know you are getting a SWEET DEAL and already devoured a grip of food -- You still are salivating at your empty plates and you still want more, more and more.

So next time you want the best sushi in the valley or ANY time you happen to be on the 10 fwy by Goodyear, stop by and Make that Trek. Your mind and tummy will thank you ten-fold and you will become a Fan. 

The only thing I wish -- as I'm sure any foodie who finds a local gem that's not a chain know --  is that I pray they never, ever close down.  Tomo, you de-virginized me as a Yelper, keep doin' what you do. Duplicate yourself if you will, but just don't ever close your doors. The area needs uber fantastic, moderately priced and modernly delicious places. First Yelp out."}
{"text":"This place has amazing sushi! The price of everything is much cheaper than any big chain of sushi companies. The inside of Tomo is really nice and dark. Perfect place to bring a date on a budget and she won't even know its cheap. 

Food 5/5
Location 5/5
Price 5/5"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. Fast, clean, fresh. Friendly staff. Favorites are Arizona, Beauty, Alaska, and Spicy Ninja, although everything here is some of the best around hands down!"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to frequent Tomo fairly often but have not been in somewhere around 3-4 months. That being said we went out today to go to Tomo since we hadn't been in awhile and were craving good food, we left somewhat disappointed. 

The food at Tomo is always delicious and never fails to impress. The sushi is amazing, cooked dishes equally as good and the portions are great for the prices. They have the best fried pork gyoza in the valley, our favorite appetizer. The problem today was the wait staff, our waiter in particular. We arrived about 15 minutes before Happy Hour ended and had to sit at the sushi bar which we generally don't do. The hostess got our drink orders and shortly there after our waiter took our order. Our food showed up quickly as always and everything was going great. Our waiter stopped by after just about all of our dishes had arrived and asked if we needed anything, at the time we didn't. Unfortunately that was the last time he gave us any face time. 

While we were eating a few more tables sat down that our waiter also took on, a table of 3 and a table of 6, both of which were in eye shot of us at the bar. A few of the other wait staff snagged some empty dishes as they passed by too quickly to flag down. Once our waiter got working with the other two tables we never saw him till the very end of our visit. We finished our meal having gone without refills for about 15 minutes. In the end the hostess that sat us actually came by to ask how we were, cause our waiter certainly had forgotten about us. I asked for a to-go box for the little bit of left overs we had and the check so we could leave and get on with our evening.

Keep in mind during our period of waiting we set our empty glasses at the edge of the bar, in full view of every service staff person that walked by in a hurry or even those standing at the computer area. 

It's sad when a hostess has to pickup the slack because a waiter forgot one of his tables. I guess he was focused more on getting tips from the larger parties he had on his plate...

TL:DR

Food here is always awesome, this last visit we had a bad experience with the wait staff."}
{"text":"This place is so good! It's the best local sushi restaurant in the west valley and the prices are good as well!"}
{"text":"Great service good food philly roll not the best but everything else good and good portion size"}
{"text":"The food is good, my favorites are the sunset roll and the monkey balls since I love mushrooms! I have been here several times and the service lacks every single time.
Last night I was there with my husband and the waitress came around once to take our order, that's it... a different server brought our food out but the waitress never returned to bring refills or to simply check in, just brought the check when she must've seen us annoyed. I always rather come here for Take Out!"}
{"text":"Food is always delicious. Love the Tatziki Salad and the Poke Salad--but this one tends to be too spicy most of the time. Amazing Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last week when we visited my brother. We always go out of our way to go to Tomo at least once when we visit (usually more than that). I had shrimp tempura and my husband had sushi spicy tuna roll. The sushi is very, very fresh and, my husband says, the best. I'm not for sushi, so I really enjoy the tempura. Not only is the food very good, but the atmosphere of the restaurant is a lot of fun. We go during happy hour and have good priced drinks and eat at the bar. The girl at the bar, Pukie, is really popular in the area and she has a group of regulars that come to visit with her. She's sort of a big draw. She makes a mean Lemon Drop, which I get every time. My husband get her Sake Martini. It all great fun, with great food, great drinks in a very relaxed atmosphere. We love it here. My advice is to go early because it can get really filled up."}
{"text":"I like the drinks and sushi at this place. I've eaten here 3 times and always have received good service. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I tried this place because my younger sister told me it was great, so both times I went with her. It's okay. The first time I went I order one of the bento lunch specials which had tempura, sashimi, a deep fried roll and miso soup. The tempura was great, the miso was luke warm, the deep fried roll was a deep fried roll nothing out of the ordinary,  and the sashimi just didn't hit it for me it didn't taste \"fresh\" the flavor in the fish was lacking. Our server at the time seemed highly un-enthused. At the time the restaurant was quite empty as well. I thought, hey maybe next time it will be better. Wrong.

 My second time back with my sister was for dinner, it was not that crowded. We were seated at the bar quite promptly, but then ignored for a very long time even though servers threw us glances quite frequently. When we finally got to ordering, our food came quite fast which was nice considering the wait. I ordered a dragon roll which tasted okay, the rice seemed a little soggy and my sister order a sushi/sashimi combo. She got a good amount of food, I didn't try any of her food so I can't vouch for anything. Now going back to the service. That night it was terrible! We did not get one server twice that evening and we had to wait 20 minutes just be able to ask for our check even though our plates were cleared and glasses were empty. I believe those are good indicators that  a server should check up on us. The best service I have had there was from the sushi chefs who helped us get the attention of the servers. Thank heavens for them.

I, personally, am not a fan. The sushi is okay, nothing to rave about. The service definitely needs work. I probably will  not be eating here any time soon unless I am in dire need of sushi and can tolerate terribly poor service. Till then I will get my sushi fix else where. So sad, I had higher hopes for this place."}
{"text":"This place is great with good music and happy hour, not to mention the waitresses were easy on the eyes last time i was there! Food is fresh and not long of a wait at all, even if they are busy."}
{"text":"I come down here about once every couple of months. It's really good sushi, rolls, etc! The teriyaki bowls are huge too! Love this place!"}
{"text":"The prices for Happy Hour are what brought us in. Waitress was rude, didn't put in our appetizer order and then disappeared. We had two separate servers check on us, asked about the appetizer again. Second server ensured she'd put it in. Asked the third server who checked in on us about the appetizer and it still hadn't been put in. The best part about all of this was that after someone checked on us we never saw the same person again. Had to flag someone else down for our check. With the amount we spent Friday night our customer service should have been better, especially since we enjoyed the food and were considering ordering more. Really didn't feel like tipping anyone as our original server was miserable and never showed up again and no one else really bothered to take care of us. Except the server we had to flag down at the end. We won't be back. Was considering actually asking for our money back as well. Oh I forgot to mention that it seemed as though the couple next to us had no server issues. Really hope this wasn't a case of discrimination."}
{"text":"Great food.  Every once in a while the service is slow. But the food is very good for Japanese cuisine. Love the popcorn lobster.  And Happy Hour 3pm to 6pm ."}
{"text":"Tomo has great happy hour specials! I highly recommend the sesame chicken. The sushi rolls are delicious as well. It's a very popular place since there aren't as many sushi restaurants on the west side of town so definitely expect to wait to be seated on the weekend. Great customer service by the staff. I've always had a good experience here."}
{"text":"I lived in Avondale for a few years while I went to school in AZ. A CA native, I enjoy delicious Sushi when I can get it. This place delivered it time and time again. I was a little scared at first since its in the middle of the dessert, but I'm glad I went in because it was awesome! Service is great, and people are nice.

Do yourself a favor and stop here when traveling to Phoenix from CA, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Ok this has been my sushi place since moving to Arizona,  they have amazing sushi the service is great the place is clean and the staff is great still the best for real sushi and great rolls the nigiri is also some of the best the slice's are large and always fresh."}
{"text":"Tomo always been our favorite place to go for sushi but the portion and services has gone down, but it's still good and close to home"}
{"text":"So disappointing.  I used to go here quite often, hadn't been in a while so I figured it would be good to go back to.  

From the beginning we probably should have just walked out.  After taking a drink order the waiter disappeared and quite honestly seemed to be purposely ignoring our table.  A no exaggeration of 15 minutes went by before I asked another person who was likely the owner to take our order.  We ordered five different items, each was a bit off.  The sesame chicken tasted singed, like the oil had gotten way too hot.  The calamari was just kind of nasty, way too much breading.  The rolls were all warm, and only one was supposed to be baked.  Luke warm sushi. I think not.  

So I guess that's one place we will definitely not be returning too.  Too bad it was pretty good in the past."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I love the prices and think it's pretty decent for sushi and appetizers. They also have a nice happy hour they do during the week. The staff is usually courteous and prompt with the food. The atmosphere is perfect for a date or even just a nice night out with frineds."}
{"text":"Was here during lunch hours (12-3) right after a workout and was starving. So the customer service here isn't bad at all, very nice polite and check in often enough to make sure everything is good. Which personally, I like. 

I gave Tomo 3 stars simply because of the food. Was with my girl and we ordered salmon and tuna sashimi, spicy sea food ramen, and a roll (red devil roll). First got the spicy ramen. Spicy ramen is nothing special at all, spice is there, noodles are there but the sea food was prob just frozen foods. Wasn't impressed I am sure I could have googled ingredients, taken a couple of shots at making it and eventually have something a lot better. IMO. The roll was just doing too much. Lots of flavor but it's all strong flavors. Thus, get a different roll. And lastly, something that really wasn't bad is the sashimi it was really fresh and 1 order is 6 slices. Generous enough for me. I really enjoyed the sashimi. I think that's the only thing that's giving this review it's 3rd star.

But yeah...have you seen Game of Thrones yet?? 

\"Boom, big badaboom, big, big badaboom\"

{"text":"This is based off of one trip & good deals. We ordered 2 rolls however I only liked one but it wasn't the establishments issues it is ALL me. Not a fan of baked sushi. Just me. This place is okee dokee for yummy Westside sushi & the best sake bomb deal all day every day. Definitely should try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place ever. All their sushi is so amazing and I love their happy hour.  The spicy seafood soup is amazing as well. Sometimes the wait is a little long to get your food but 2 out of 3 times they'll offer you miso soup for your wait. The food is for sure 5 stars,  but I'm  Putting 4 cause the service isn't always great. If you haven't tried I totally recommend. I bring everyone here and I've never had someone not like it."}
{"text":"I haven't wrote a review for Tomo though I've been going there a few times over the years, it has always been a personal favorite that's close by for me and I've always been treated good here. 

I want to say I've tried almost all of the rolls already and they are all pretty good and have been consistent and delicious! I've taken my family to try this place out and they all enjoyed this place a lot more than others around this area. 

Keep up the good work Tomo!"}
{"text":"The size of their sushi rolls are super small what a rip off this place is going down hill really quick.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, good happy hour deals, and good service. Been here a handful of times and have always been more than happy with the food. The last few times, our service has been great. We did go in one time later in the evening and got a not so warm welcome. Luckily I'm laid back and understand how annoying it is for a customer to come in minutes before closing time, so we took it to go. People complain about getting crappy service, but I think it's crappy customers that are the problem."}
{"text":"First time and the last time, I will never go back to Tomo. It took the waiter ten minutes for us to even get asked for drinks. Then at the time to pay, I got charged the wrong amount and then the manager didn't want to honor the right price for the chicken Teraki , he said I soy have to do this, it's obvious he doesn't care about his customers. When it was his employee fault for not charging the right amount. Don't go hear it's not worth your time and money. Go else where tomo is not the place for sushi, go to Another place."}
{"text":"Great place. White tuna is amazing! Brian is amazing with his client.. you can't beat the food and the customers service here.   My family and i are regular at the this restaurant.  Great food, great people and beautiful decorated.. 5 stars all day long!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great rolls came out fast.  Server Was Great And friendly. My only thing was our first 3 rolls came out fast our last roll took at least 15 minutes if not longer. Than I got unsure of our server since halfway through we would get different people. Overall A Good Place And The Sushi Was good."}
{"text":"so, after a lovely walk at Robbin's Butte Wildlife Area, we hit up Tomo for our Valentine's Day supper.

unfortunately, the service was sub-par, to put it nicely. when we arrived, we were seated promptly; however, when the waitress came by for our orders(about 10 minutes later), we told her we'd need another minute. well...10-15 minutes ticked by, as we watched several more tables seated, and a couple of orders taken.

finally, a different waitress came by and took our orders. Jamie had the fried cream cheese jalapenos, and the Spicy Crunch roll, while I ordered the edamame(to share), the Hibachi Seaweed Salad, and the white tuna carpaccio.

Jamie's orders came within a reasonable amount of time, as did the edamame. I had to wait considerably longer for the salad(a big disappointment; a lump of greasy seaweed on top of a huge pile of oily lettuce), and my carpaccio came out 20 minutes or so after Jamie had finished his second course. completely unacceptable. Jamie also had to stop the waitress to ask for his soda to be refilled, after she walked past his empty glass several times.

the one bright point? my carpaccio was fresh and delightful. I ordered it with the sauce on the side, which was definitely a good idea, as it was pure sesame and chili oils, and the spice and oil would have swamped the delicate flavor of the fish itself.

we'll return, but only in the middle of a non-holiday weekday, hoping for much better service than we received this past Monday."}
{"text":"Excellent quality and selection of sushi plus good, authentic Japanese food for non-sushi eaters. The happy hour specials, every day 3 to 6, can't be beat. I've tried almost everything on the menu and haven't had anything bad. All the sushi is good and the noodle soups and katsu are just like I used to have  when I lived in Japan. Service has always been superb. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was there a change in ownership or something? Not the same place we've loved for the last decade.

Many things are different and none of them are for the better. We ordered two California Rolls and they came like 30 seconds later. There is no way they were fresh. This was confirmed when they would not stay together and would fall apart every time you picked up a piece. The rice was old and odd looking. The seaweed was soft and wet and not crisp like we're used to. Really disappointed.

The Shrimp Tempura came out and the shrimp were EXTRA SMALL. About half the size of the shrimp that they used to use. Also, they brought out the tempura sauce in the little dish you use to mix wasabi and soy sauce and wasn't nearly enough to finish the meal.

Everything that was fried was not crispy and was oily and soggy. The tempura and gyoza were both this way and not enjoyable.

Really disappointed in our meal at Tomo which is normally our favorite place in the area."}
{"text":"We are big fans of Tomo for the sushi bar!  We've never experienced anything else, there so I can't comment on that table service.  They have some of the best sushi in the West Valley.  They also have a great happy hour with a good selection and good prices.  Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Service sucks, but the sushi are good~!I do not think the owners know what is great customer service. be prepared to wait a while!  If they know that people are waiting over an hour for food due to their understaffing, have the decency to communicate with the customers so they can either leave or understand the situation. waited about 2 hours for cold monkey balls."}
{"text":"This is my fave sushi spot on the west side! Good sushi is so hard to find, but Tomo will definitely hit the spot. Def recommended!"}
{"text":"Been here several times with my wife who first showed me this place while we were dating. The food has always been great and so has the service. Happy hour is the best deal in town and their wings are pretty amazing too, obviously the sushi is great. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Service was horrible, left without eating. No one is waiting to seat you at the door and once you get seated just roll the dice to find out if someone will ever come to take your order. I will never return to this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely deliciously satisfying!  Always impressed with their sushi rolls. And they have the best happy hour for both drinks and food! Not to mention the complimentary miso. Yum to say the least."}
{"text":"We come here pretty regularly and think that the sushi is pretty good.  Best in the west valley that we've had so far.  The staff is nice but not great as our drinks are not always filled but we're greeted every time we come in.  They've got a pretty good variety of sushi rolls and sashimi.  The hot foods are decent, too.  I've seen large groups there before and the ambiance is perfect for either a date or a group."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots!! With that being said, the food is fresh, the lunch specials are awesome but the customer service can be a bit tedious.  The staff is friendly but sometimes we have to wait for them to come back around."}
{"text":"Oh I just love this place! I get the spicy miso ramen, and the spicy mico seafood ramen is also good as well. 

My reason for the 4 star is that their service need more work the mangier is amazing but the waiters are a hit and miss. Once we went in and we had an very nice lady I don't remember her name. It was the end of her shift and the other waiters just left us sitting there so we had to flag down one to ask for water, but she didn't come back after that.. One lady gave us the check but we had left overs and we just sat there for a while waiting for her to come back. She would walk by glancing at the check to see if we paid but I wanted my to go box first and I tried to get her attention. We got mad so I went up to give the manger the check and to ask for to go boxes. He was very nice and helped up with our food.

I don't like to get down for this reason but I will take there food to go any time!"}
{"text":"I've always loved this place. Came here a few years ago when they first opened up, and they offered us free soup, and ski because we have never tried it. While we were waiting for our food we had a nice conversation with the people there. They are extremely friendly and real chill people. The place is a very relaxing feel even when it is packed which as of it's gain in popularity it's always packed! Great for them because they deserve it. They have some of the best food in it's class in the west valley for a great deal you won't find no where else! 

Great prices for great food! Friendly staff and great environment! Go and try it out!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in town. Their happy hour can't be beat and I go every time I'm down from flagstaff. Having moved down from WA, I was hard pressed to find some good fish and I was blown away by this place considering we're in the middle of a desert."}
{"text":"Our favorite spot . Delicious sushi. Oh the double double. Yum!! Waitresses are good and on top of it . Atmosphere great. And they gave happy hour everyday 3-6 half price sushi and drinks, boom! Oh and my hubby and I have been going there for the past 8 yrs. same guys making the sushi"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi rolls. Great happy hour deals! Really like this place. Always nice and clean too!"}
{"text":"Had yami yami roll and hawaii roll. (23.00)
Sushi was pretty good. 
Restaurant is nice.

Thay gave me a dirty plate and napkin when I sat down.

The wasabi was really watery and grainy. 

As I saw in other reviews, the service was SLOW. restaurant was maybe half full for lunch.
No real reason to come back again, better pptions are out there."}
{"text":"After 7 years in Oinawa this is the best Sushi that I have had in two years in the states.  The best part...BESIDES the food...was the service.  I have tried just about every type of sushi they offer and even some that the chef experimented with!  

Although it is not Sushi from Okinawa, it is a DAMN good runner up!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times on weekend evenings and it is pretty busy. The service is a bit slow, but not horrible. The food is good, not amazing, but I should note that I'm not the biggest seafood person.

Pros:
$5 sake bombers all day
sit at the bar get free miso soup"}
{"text":"Worst experience I have had at any restaurant. Waited in food for way to long, and once we got our food they brought out the check. Felt very rushed the entire time, the waiter was to busy to even pay attention to us. He was also to lazy to hand check to the individuals and set them on the table and left. I would recommend any other sushi restaurant in the valley."}
{"text":"Food is almost always good. Reasonably priced. Service can be a little slows, but always pleasant"}
{"text":"It was our first visit & we found the Bento Box lunches to be plentiful & delicious.  we had to take some leftovers home which tasted just as good when reheated & served.  The California rolls were also just as good the next day.  The only negatives we experienced are:  1.  Our Miso soup arrived after the Bento boxes were served.  It would have been nice to have that served immediately after our order was placed;  2.  Since there were several of us at the table, we asked for a second small dish of ginger & wasabe, but, the server gave us a bad time & told us that it's one serving per table.  After an exchange of words & our offer to purchase another small dish of the condiments, she reluctantly brought us another serving;  3.  The hot green tee was not complimentary as it is in most Asian food restaurants;  4.  When my husband asked for a second small serving of dipping sauce for his tempura, once again, our server acted perturbed & returned with a different dipping sauce that was cold & vinegary-tasting.  the restrooms appeared clean & nice.  All-in-all,  the food was good tasting, nicely presented, very reasonably priced, with the exception of the hot green tea which should have been complimentary.  we will definitely return & recommend it.  however, we will ask for a different server who really put a damper on our overall enjoyment of our dining.  If her name is on the receipt, I will post it in another review so others may avoid her."}
{"text":"The only reason this is not 1 star is the food was not terrible. After being seated 25 minutes before the server came over, and another 15 minutes before we got our water. After taking our drink order they had to come back 3 times to verify that they took our drink order correct and we still had to send a drink back. Food plates came out at different times and main plates came out before appetizers and some of the drinks came out way after food. Some of our order never even came out. We weren't going to complain but then when it came time to pay they gave us our bills correct and we put our credit card down on the receipt and they flip flopped our credit cards and charged me for my friends bill.  We finally asked for management and it took 25 minutes for the manager to come over."}
{"text":"I have been to many sushi places in Arizona. I just moved to Avondale and was worried there wouldn't be any good sushi restaurants, but I had nothing to worry about! This place is absolutely delicious. They have unique sushi rolls that melt in your mouth. The miso soup is free with the meal (always a plus) and it is flavorful. Their drinks are extremely affordable (for me it's very important to have sake bombs with my sushi). The prices for sushi are pretty typical, but everything else on the menu seemed really inexpensive. Delicious AND wonderful service. I will be back."}
{"text":"There's always something that has been disappointing at Tomo. Our last experience our waitress forgot our food, but we looked past it because of how yummy it is. 

Our visit tonight was a mirror image of last time. She forgot our rice again, and brought the check at the end of our meal. The check included the rice and I told her we never received it. Instead of asking if we still wanted it, she just apologized and just took the receipt back to take the rice off. 

I'm sorry tomo, but we are breaking up."}
{"text":"Great food and great experience. You get quality food without breaking your pockets. Been coming here for years. The Bento lunches and Happy Hours menu has a lot of variety."}
{"text":"This was a good experience, not great but good.

Best things.  The waitress Cece was awesome.  It was very hard to find anything vegan on the menu but with her help I was able to order an appetizer, soup and main dish all off menu.
The rest of the wait staff was on their toes.  The food was delivered promptly and hot. Our drinks were never empty. 

Good things.  The atmosphere was nice, not overdone.  The sound level was acceptable.

Poor things.  The food was on the bland side.

We will probably come back again"}
{"text":"Tomo has very good sushi, great happy hour, ambiance and friendley service.  If I want sushi I go to Tomo!"}
{"text":"So today bf decided to go out for dinner since I've been cooking the last 5   days (besides Saturday actually) while staying with him in Arionza..hehe he said he heard this place was good from his friend so we decided to try it. It was a kinda far drive from Glendale to Goodyear but at least it wasn't a disappointment!

I wasn't super hungry so I ordered just one roll..the Beauty roll they called it. It was a spicy salmon and cucumber roll topped with salmon and avocados. it was super delicious! the salmon wasn't too spicy and it was pretty fresh, not to mention a kinda fatty salmon..which is okay because omega 3 fats are good for you...but of course in moderate amounts...hehe 

My bf ordered the chicken teriyaki entree. It took really long to come out and i almost thought they forgot it...just as i was about to ask for it..they waitress came out with it. It was a pretty big plate and on top of the chicken were these big fried onion rings. I really like the onion rings but he didn't really like the very thick sweet sauce that was drizzled on top of it. The chicken was very tender and juicy and flavorful...the teriyaki sauce was a bit thick I admit and a bit too sweet but it didn't really ruin the dish...it was still very good. 

The service was superb...well it is a Monday night and they were not busy at all...there were only 3-4 tables when we got there...but more people came in later. The waitress came around many times to ask if we needed anything which was nice but I also think that she was pretty bored. hehe 

Yay! We found a pretty good place for sushi rolls and Japanese entrees. =D"}
{"text":"Their lunches are incredible. Especially like the Lunch Bento D. I think this is some of the best sushi on the Westside. I love their salads.  The noodles are also very good.  Prices are really good.  Service also is prompt.  I love the BBQ beef so tasty sometimes to much fat though."}
{"text":"The main thing that upset both my husband and I were the sushi chefs. We decided to sit at the sushi bar because we both like interacting with our sushi chefs and as soon as we sat down neither chefs greeted us or even looked at us. We waited and waited but nothing. After the waitress took our drink order I decided to give it the college try and strike up a convo with one of them. He didn't seem very interested and when my husband asked if he could add sauce or spruce up the nigiri sushi the chef replied with \" no, not today. \" ummm excuse me me? You couldn't add some sauce to the fish? In our opinion they were both being jerks ( my husband used another word). I am not one to cuss on yelp but who does that? We ended up moving to a table because they were not nice at all. They didn't even ask if we wanted ginger and wasabi. Anyways, on to the food...
The sushi was not bad. My husband and I ordered the passion of fire roll and red devil roll( we added shrimp tempura to that one. )They came out fast and were both pretty good but nothing special. We also ordered the monkey balls appetizer and that was pretty good as well but still nothing about this restaurant was Amazing. I will be going back to Osaka as my go to Sushi restaurant. The waitress was sweet and awesome and so was the older lady that worked there I'm guessing she's an owner not sure though. One other thing, I was expecting my passion of fire roll to be lit on fire... It was one fire in the picture. Yes, not all rolls will look like the pictures but should come somewhat close."}
{"text":"First came to this sushi bar right around when it first opened. Everything here was fresh and tasted wonderful. Service was good. Rolls were amazing. One of the better sushi bars on this side of town."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a close friend because he works here. Came here and it was during their lunch specials time. My friend and I both got their Bento B lunch combo, and my other friend tried their Ramen special. 

The food was cheap, Bento box range from 9-15 dollars depending on what you get. The Ramen wasn't anything special. The Bento box was cheap but the food quality could be better. The sushi didn't taste that fresh... But it was edible. I would give their sushi 7/10. 

Although the food wasn't anything special the restaurant was very nice a modernized. The designs was very nice and the service was beyond great! 

I would come back again but I will probably not get the Bento box again and try something else. Perhaps maybe their specialty sushi would possibly taste better and more fresh."}
{"text":"Owner Brian is super cool and friendly. This is my favorite spot on Az.  I like their interior and atmosphere and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of fish here in Goodyear.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"The overall dining experience I had here was good. The good is great! The group I was in ordered the calamari as a started... It's calamari, nothing too spectacular about it. The rolls at the table that were ordered were: Crazy, Philadelphia, and Arizona. I ate the Crazy, and it was delicious! Hands down the best sushi I have had in a while. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very cool and unique. However, we had a waitress who seemed less than happy to be waiting on us. She was rude, unhelpful, and impatient. Other than that, I recommend you try this!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service!!! Gotta love the owner Joe, his hospitality and customer service far more exceeds my expectations. Me and my family enjoy eating there and have not been disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Our waiter had absolutely no personality. Then he disappeared never once came back to ask how the food was or refill our water. Never will I be back. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go to Tomo for their happy hour ( every day from 3-6pm), before going to the movies. We asked to be seated at the bar, so they did promptly, they had a full house. We started with some Monkey Balls from the Happy Hour menu, which was a very good size portions of mushrooms stuffed with crab meat, cream cheese and fried tempura style, served with 2 different sauces, these were yummy, not soggy at all. Then we got a Sashimi combination that came with a spicy tuna roll, real good. One of their specialty is the Ninja roll, that has jalapeño pepper in the filling and it's served tempura style, as well.
Their Crazy roll is also very good, their portions are very generous, and loved being able to see the Sushi masters do their job with excellence, sushi rolls kept coming out non stop with the same level of mastery.
Kudos to this establishment!! Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Bad service! Upon arriving there was no greeter in sight leavibg us confused about the seating process. Once seated at a table it was not clean. I had to get up and find menus with an apology being provided later in the visit. Giving the establshment an opportunity, we proceeded to order and was given the wrong order once it arrived. We had to ask several times if the order was ours. We were offered free miso soup, yet it came with the order, yet was never received. Once the miso soup arrived I noticed that it was simply water filled with heavy pork oil drippings. This was a MAJOR problem seeing that me and my guest are vegetarians. To add insult to injury, we were not given gjnger or wasabi with our roles, which is traditional. We were told that we had to ask being the straw that collapsed the camel back. We will be requesting a complimentary visit or a full refund. The wait staff did apologize, yet customer service training is needed to improve the guest experience."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been coming here for years now! Sushi at a great price during happy hour, including happy hour drinks! Can't beat this place especially if you go to hang out with a group of friends!"}
{"text":"Been going there since it opened.  Never been disappointed!  Food is always delicious.  Great service and atmosphere.  My go to sushi place!"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy my dinner and customer service here,but for some reason this time around I feel like I was rushed to eat and get out... To be honest before writing this review it happen to me so many times not just once... This place is my go to for lunch or dinner. The food there is always good don't get me wrong I love it... But rushing me to eat and get out and pay... I don't like that at all... I would like to enjoy my food, not get kicked out... I took my brother and sister law come eat dinner here.. The waitress keep asking if we need the bill or boxes for the food.. Okay if I need the bill I will ask for it, if I need boxes I will ask... But they keep asking me until I guess they got frustrated they just brought the bill over and put on my table... Okay so your kicking me out... The hell service is that... My bill don't get me wrong is always 50++ and I don't care about it. If the owner is reading this please go over with the waitress... I love the place and food, but kicking me out is so wrong... What I hate most is I didn't ask for the bill and they just put on my table...."}
{"text":"So...Tomo is an interesting place. It takes it's \"fusion\" concept a little far I think and the music/setting just feel strange. However, the food is pretty good and the prices aren't bad. I used to live in japan and my standards are pretty high but this place just meets them. It's not fantastic, but for a quick Japanese lunch, it's a place to put on the list. I like the Curry ok and their ramen wasn't bad either. The Katsu is I think probably your best bet unless you're their for sushi. Not being a fan of Sushi I cannot comment on how they fair in that regard."}
{"text":"The Las Vegas roll was really good, not the best but good. The soft shelled crab was burnt. Very disappointed. The waiters were really nice and gave us excellent service. Ok just for a taste if sushi, but not the best sushi place around!"}
{"text":"We took full advantage of their happy hour.  I had two sushi rolls and a small miso, hubby had the spicy ramen soup and mussels. I had to ask for wasabi.  Traditional sushi, nothing spectacular but a generous portion.  We lingered after our meal, and were continually checked on by different employees.  I wasn't sure if we were being rushed, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt as it wasn't overly crowded."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 15 times since my last review and they've really stepped it up service-wise.  Nice job Tomo - you earned my loyalty for as long as you are in Avondale."}
{"text":"The best part of this experience was the host. She was sweet and the most helpful employee there, including the manager. The server took 20 mins to stop by (the host got us waters and took our drink order). Our drink order was wrong after he came by 3 times to verify the order. Our food came out before our drinks. Appetizers arrived last. Some food never showed up. The server wasn't attentive enough so we could tell him. Then the bill came and  we were charged incorrectly after verifying our check was correct. We asked for the manager and someone came by, who wasn't the manager! So we waited for another 15 mins for the actual manager to come by. Just one of the worst experiences I've had in the food industry. Having only two servers staffed on a Saturday night is not a good excuse for poor service. Either you close tables down or get managers to wait tables. I'll never go back here."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Had the pork katsu with curry. Fabulous. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Tomo has been a hit and miss for me. What is good on their menu has been good, but some items should just be avoided. I'll start with the bad because I would hate to leave on a sour note.

The items that should definitely be avoided are the ramen bowls. Their broth is either very bland, too salty, or they might have that overcooked, bitter vegetable taste. Also, order the udon at your own risk. It may suffer for the same reasons. Another item to look out for would be their tuna (sashimi or nigiri). As weird as this sounds, good raw fish shouldn't smell fishy. Their tuna did, and its texture was lackluster. However, during a recent visit it does seem to be doing better.

On to the good things. They have hands down, the best Japanese curry that I've had in an Arizona restaurant. Its flavors are vibrant, comes with red pickled ginger on the side (classic Japanese style), and the katsu is incredibly juicy and crisp. Their rolls are also delicious, my favorite being the nemo. It is salmon (my favorite raw fish) and tuna on top of a cali roll. Also, if you're ordering from the lunch, I recommend bento A, if not order during happy hour. Time your visit right, and you might be able to do both.

Overall, I still come here because of my love for Japanese curry, and because the atmosphere is great for outings with friends. I would still recommend it despite its setbacks."}
{"text":"Great sushi my favorite sushi especially the spicy ninja roll!! So yum love there sushi. The owner is super nice I usually get sushi to go and he always ask how I am thats nice.Keep up the good work tomo :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's my go to neighborhood Japanese spot. Great food and staff. Love the bar area, very chill yet lively. Great bar tender! Also great lunch special deals!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times, the food is Ok, i decided to try some spicy ramen, it was not that great no flavor at all.  Anyway there is this waitress  named Alize young thin girl with long hair a bit curly, she was cleaning the table next to us with a wooden divider next to my wife when all lf a sudden she made a loud thud on the divider and it startled me and my wife, we are  ot overreacting she hit the divider pretty hard while my wife was sipping her soup, my wife wasnt happy of course and gave her a bit of an evil stare and she noticed this and stared back at my wife without apologizing.  So I asked her name and even verified it to my waitress if that was her name.  So for all u Tomo regulars make sure u guys stay away from a waitress named Alize"}
{"text":"Here I go being indecisive again..

We came here a LOT in the time since my last review- probably as often as once a week or so. We got to be \"regulars\" and were once even treated to a \"VIP Discount\" we didn't know we were given. This said, I'm not a fan of their weekend afternoon staff. The last time we went, we had a waitress we'd had one other time with lackluster service.

Well, we came in and were the only other people in the whole place. An older man was eating alone and then got up to leave. After we were seated, a woman and her daughter and another couple came in. The woman and her daughter ordered the exact same thing as us (two chicken bowls) and received their food before us. No big deal, but then the couple behind us and a girl who came in to place a to-go order all received their food before us. Then, all of them paid, got up, and left. We couldn't believe it! As soon as we started looking around like, \"What the heck?!\" Our waitress popped by with two chicken bowls- we think the order either didn't get made or we were forgotten about completely.

We left no tip and don't plan on going back for a long while."}
{"text":"Food is good however disappointed with what I saw while I ate here at the bar, the sushi roll guy is scrolling on his phone with a glove on as u can see in the picture I posted, during down time. He gets a order goes straight to grab the raw food with the SAME glove he was scrolling on his phone which we know has germs, SHAME ON YOU TOMO, management if your going to enforce gloves while handing our food, use the gloves up and change them out before touching food!!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi spot. Definitely the best in the west valley. Their happy hour is 3:00-6:00 daily and has some great deals on it. Service can be a little slow in Fri and Sat nights but the sushi is delicious."}
{"text":"I am pretty picky about Japanese food as I studied abroad in japan and Tomo is excellent. We ordered the tuna tartar and two sushi rolls. Everything was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday with a friend because a rainy day called for some ramen. The food was delicious! We didn't have anything that wasn't good. Ramen was alright but not as good as other places we've been. Happy hour daily is what's up! We got monkey balls, ramen, Las Vegas roll and pork gyoza. Everything was delicious and the ramen was mediocre but it wasn't bad. The monkey balls were amazing. Best tasting balls I've ever had in my mouth. Lol!!"}
{"text":"Not great! We gave this a try on our way thru town, after seeing the reviews I thought it'd be a good dinner away from the typical fast food of long drives. I was wrong. We got in, asked if there was a wait (since it looked crowded, good sign) we were told no on the wait, bonus! We waited about 10 minutes for a table, ehh no biggie. Got our order in relatively quick and we got our miso soup and hibachi salads. Wow is that dressing powerful! It's overpowering wasabi flavor left my nostrils burning and my stomach turning. I couldn't eat much of it, it was so powerful. Not good! Then two of our party of four got their dinners from the kitchen, the chicken yakisoba was great and that's the reason for the two stars! Tonkotsu ramen was just ok. We waited the longest for the sushi, so long in fact that the others had finished their meals before the sushi got to our table. Sushi was mediocre at best. I couldn't eat much because of the effect of the salad, but the philly roll was the better of my two rolls. I didn't care for the Arizona roll at all. The service wasn't too attentive but the long wait for sushi was the kicker. We went as a family to eat as a family and we didn't get that. We left disappointed and wishing we'd gone with something else. I'm sure there are better options locally for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"I'm begrudgingly giving Tomo 3 stars because their food is quite good.  We went for my birthday on April 26, which is a Tuesday night, at about 5:45, and there weren't very many people there.  I'd lucked out and got a Restaurant.com gift card for $25, and told them ahead of time.  We ordered 2 appetizers (gyoza and a spicy yellowtail roll), 2 rolls (spicy ninja, and oyshi), and a chirashi.  The appetizers didn't come out at the same time, they came out about 10 minutes apart.  We thought that was weird, but rolled with it.  Our entrees came out at different times as well, which was quite annoying.  I hate sitting and watching people eat while I twiddle my thumbs, which is what I ended up doing at my birthday dinner.  We had to remind the waitress about the chirashi, and that took a really long time to get out, we joked the chef couldn't make up his mind.  My husband and I were talking about how insane the wait times were and a staff member was standing nearby (totally unintentional, not passive aggressive) and said they got slammed at 5:30.  Ok, that's great, we got here after you got slammed and it's now 6:30.  It's UNACCEPTABLE for someone to order their rolls and get them after people ordering hot food like teriyaki.  Hire another sushi chef for crying out loud!  An hour should have been PLENTY of time to recover from getting \"slammed\".  All-in-all it took 2 hours for a dinner that should have only taken 1 hour.  They also didn't really apologize, nothing was taken off the bill, no percentage off, so it was basically a \"sucks to be you\" thumbing of the nose at us.

For the food:
The gyoza was delicious.  The filling was tasty, but there wasn't enough vinegar in the dipping sauce.  Too much shoyu.

The spicy yellowtail roll was very tasty and I would recommend it.  It wasn't very spicy, but it was spicier than the spicy ninja roll!

The spicy ninja roll was hyped up more than it delivered.  It wasn't bad, but it was too big to eat properly.  You really can't take a piece in your mouth all at once without looking like a pig.  Ladies, don't order this if you're out on a date with a guy unless you want them thinking naughty thoughts.  The fried jalapeno was seeded and deveined, so none of the spiciness remained.  Disappointing.

The oyshi was delicious.  There was no rice in it, making it a great choice for low carb sushi lovers.  It wasn't particularly filling though.

The chirashi was good.  The cuts of fish were excellent, and the pickled vegetables were a nice addition.  I really hate tamago (too sweet!), so to see it in the bowl was disappointing.  You pay so much for something, don't give me sweetened scrambled eggs as one of the choices!

We would probably get take-out from them but wouldn't dine-in again.  The wait times are ridiculous.  I understand that they're hiring new people (saw their ad on Craigslist), but you really need to work on this Tomo!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and such a good deal. Only giving four stars because the waiters are hit or miss sometimes. There's one young lady with black hair and we love when she serves us, she's been there a while and we always get consistent service from her. Our last waitress on the other hand was a pretty young Hispanic woman, (I wish I got her name to not have to use descriptors). As soon as we were seated it was almost like we were inconveniencing her to be helping us. You could see it in her face and the way she responded. My friend and I have both been managers in food service, and we know how it gets sometimes, but it was a relatively slow night. We ended up realizing that she was at the end of her shift when someone else immediately took over at 8 on the dot. I get that you're at the end of your shift and won't finish the night with us, but we deserve the same quality of kindness (hopefully) as everyone else that was served prior to you being ready to clock out. In the future we will just try to avoid this server, as we love this location and enjoy coming in."}
{"text":"Well I hate to disagree with the reviews on here about this place but I thought the food was sub par. I am not sure if I went on an off night but I was not impressed at all. I had monkey balls and ninja jalapenos to start and they were terribly breaded and flavorless. Next came locally named rolls that were all covered in eel sauce and were not made with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Food came out wrong or didn't came at all I litterly sat there watch my husband eat all his food and dinner and my food wasn't even out. When it did come it was wrong and I feed up just paid and left. Ask for glasses twice because they all had lips marks on them. This place is very dirty and has poor service. When I ask for the check they threw it at me and walked off, like they were mad at me when I did nothing wrong. Omg I never been treated like so in my life. Good luck to who ever eat at this place.!"}
{"text":"Went in with the best intentions and the atmosphere is great buuuut...Way too much rice on the rolls, greasy spider roll...miso you simply cant mess up but the ramen seafood was not fresh. i should know better to get seafood in the desert. Still looking for a good asian rest. in the west valley.."}
{"text":"I would not return here, the food was really not that great and service was even worse. The spicy garlic edamame was basically microwaved edamame with garlic powder sprinkled on top, definitely not worth getting. The sushi rolls were oversized and cut un proportioned and the waitress brought no side of ginger or wasabi with the sushi nor sauce for our gyoza. It took very long to get assistance from the waitstaff. At the end they charged us extra soda to the bill that we did not order. Save yourselves from eating here"}
{"text":"Great food! Service good to excellent. Always a pleasant experience. It's not cheap but I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"So good.   The food is amazing.   The restraint is cute and comfortable.  Awesome lighting.   My children love it.  We ordered tea,  pot stickers,  sushi,  Yakisoba,  Teriyaki chicken and several sushi rolls.  It was all amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for your sushi fix and the restaurant is very nice inside. Food is always fresh and the staff is very friendly. Try them out if you haven't!"}
{"text":"Fresh Fish, these guys have some of the best and freshest fish in the valley......i eat only raw sashimi so i know my fish. the UNI is very good, all t he tuna is top shelf and the slamon melts in your mouth...thanks TOMO"}
{"text":"Although the sushi and the sashimi here is good. I really like the ramen soups here. The miso ramen noodle soup and tonkatsu ramen noodle soup are really good.  It makes me yearn for a ramen soup restaurant.  If you've never had real Japanese ramen soup this is a treat, I'm not taking about the flavor packages of ramen noodles you can buy at any store for like 10 cents, this is the real thing. The ramen soups are priced nicely, but the rolls and other sushi seems over priced to me. Compared to other Japanese restaurants in the west valley, it's up toward the top, but it's also priced at the top."}
{"text":"AVOID this place like the plague!

To begin with, I took my children--all of whom are half Japanese and were born in Japan--to this restaurant to celebrate my daughter's 12th birthday. We were hoping for something good, but ended up with something worse than terrible. 

The two menus we received for a party of four were sticky and not appealing. The waiter did come relatively quickly and took our drink orders, but was a little too pushy when trying to get our food orders. My kids do take some time to decide what they want, but we felt very rushed. I had my birthday girl order first. We all ordered and all was fine. The gyoza we ordered cam first and it tasted like something from the frozen food section that was just warmed in a microwave. My birthday girl ordered a fairly simple sushi roll with miso soup. The miso soup did come out quickly, but after my son and I had our ramen and my youngest daughter had her udon, my birthday girl's simple sushi roll was no where to be seen. After we had all but finished our meals, my daughter was still waiting for her simple sushi roll. I inquired about this and was told that it was being made. 5 minutes later, I asked again--same answer. Several minutes later I told a man who I think was a manager that this was unacceptable. He started making all kinds of excuses and refused to apologize or do anything to remedy the situation. Finally, after refusing to accept any excuses for this pathetic service, the food was delivered to our table. Can you just imagine how my 12 year old daughter felt to be ignored and forgotten in such a manner? 

Now, let's talk about the food--my son and I both ordered ramen and, yes, I am a ramen snob, but this was the single worst bowl of ramen I have ever tasted in my life. I can honestly say that every bowl or cup of instant ramen that I have ever ingested in my life was orders of magnitude better than this tasteless bowl of strings. The soup literally had no taste and the chashu (pork belly) was as chewy as an old shoe when it is supposed to melt in your mouth. My daughter's udon was equally terrible, and my birthday girl's sushi roll was definitely not worth waiting for. This food was the single worst Japanese food we have ever had anywhere. They do not deserve to call themselves a Japanese restaurant for anyone with any kind of Japanese background or heritage would be ashamed to serve this food. 

The service was atrocious, the food was unpalatable, and the overall vibe of the place was terrible. Save your money, go somewhere else. This restaurant is only taking up valuable real estate space in the west valley."}
{"text":"I'm wondering if there was a change in ownership or management.  This place used to have great service.  Tonight the hostess seated us at a table near the door, we asked if there was something further back and she said they were full. As I looked around I saw a booth and a half booth half table when I enquirer I was told they were only for big parties. When I mentioned it was 6:30pm on a Thursday and they had 4 open tables, she grudgingly said that we could have one of the tables.  We left and will not be back."}
{"text":"This was my BF's & my first time at a Japanese restaurant and our first time really eating sushi. It was AMAZING! The waitress was really patient with me because I had no idea what to order with all the options! We started out with a Tono Mojito & Cherry Blossom Drink- mojito was too strong but his was perfect. 
My BF is semi allergic to shellfish, so he got the Teriyaki Bowl- it's everything we've been wanting, seriously so good. I ordered the Popcorn Lobster Roll which was TO DIE FOR!! And the basic Spicy Tuna Roll & Spicy Crab. He ate most of the Spicy Crab and we weren't a fan of the Spicy Tuna Roll- which we ended up taking both home. 
I will definitely come back and recommend everyone! I will add, it was very busy and we felt like we were the only customers in there, great service!"}
{"text":"The food here is not bad.  However, I will never go here again based on the service experience.  If you are going to share tables then you need to figure out how to communicate with your fellow servers.  We waited especially long times for drinks, food...and then when we would ask they would all huddle to see who knew what.  Then they would make excuses to us that it wasn't them.  It was just terrible and ruined our experience.  A shame you lose business based on service."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday night and was seated at the sushi bar within minutes. Everyone who came in was seated within 5 minutes. Sushi rolls were fantastic! I'm a fan of spicy rolls and there were so many to choose from! Definitely the most roll choices of any sushi place I've been to in the West Valley. Will definitely be going back anytime we want good sushi!"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me, knows I enjoy food. And more than anything, I love Mexican food! After that, seafood is a close second. Which is probably why I venture out for sushi every once in a while. And in the five years or so that I've been learning about this cuisine, I've dined at a few different sushi restaurants all over the valley. Tomo Japanese Cuisine is a solid choice for quality, atmosphere and value, which is why my girlfriend and I have enjoyed several meals here during that time.

Admittedly, I am a novice. But I realize that most of the options I have tasted or will describe here, are technically California Rolls. It doesn't phase me, cause I will try anything once.

This past weekend, me and a couple friends stopped in at the Dysart Road location. They are more familiar with the menu, so it was a great experience enjoying some of their favorites.

For starters, the Garlic Edamame and Ninja Jalapeños are each very flavorful. The roasted garlic makes something as ordinary as soy beans taste amazing! The Ninja Jalapeños are one of my favorite menu items. Think of them as Asian jalapeño poppers.

We each chose an entree and shared. I enjoyed my selection, the Spicy Ninja because it included jalapeños and cream cheese. And who would've thought you would see \"spicy mayo\" in a Japanese restaurant!? The Tomo Special was good too because it featured some nice sized fried shrimp. But the best entree was the Popcorn Lobster, hands down! There was a very generous portion of deep fried langostino lobster meat. Plus it was a beautiful presentation!

The service was lacking a little personality on this visit. If I had my preference, we would've sat at the sushi bar. It's always fun to watch the chefs and chat with them. Regardless, Tomo never fails to deliver a satisfying meal. See you again soon!"}
{"text":"So I had never been here before. I came with a friend. The reason I am giving 3 stars is I was not very impressed. We had a long wait to begin with. We both ordered something. The person who was delivering mine, almost gave my meal to someone else. To top it off when they charged us, they kept messing it up. It was just a big mess. I don't know if I would go back. The sushi was alright. I might be willing to give it a chance another time. We'll see."}
{"text":"Want to thank Hong for her great customer service! She was on top of everything I didn't have to ask for anything. 
Thank you Hong your service was excellent! :)"}
{"text":"Best sushi rolls on the Westside!!!!! Hands down my favorite sushi place I have ever been too!!!!!! I love the atmosphere and even when it's busy service is still pretty good!!!!!!!! I always  recommend this place to everyone I know"}
{"text":"THE WORST RESTAURANT IN THE WEST VALLEY!! !! No exaggeration at all.  We would drive over 30 min for this sushi and no longer. Every single time there would be something wrong with our food. No soy paper as ordered, missing rolls, forgot to bag my kids meal, and finally didn't place order in the computer and there we were on pick up at closing time with no food. THE OWNERS ARE DISGRACEFUL!! Never did they feel bad for their mistakes or take full ownership. To this day we never got a full refund for any orders that went wrong. It was always \"what's your name next time $10 off\". This last time was the 3rd mistake in a row and when we called asking for a full refund the owner wouldn't and only said \"well seems like we lost you as a customer anyways, I can only refund the amount of food you didn't get\". The customer service is by far the rudest I've ever seen. We enjoyed the food and so we'd order and take it to go so we wouldn't be upset eating in person what with the horrible service. I've never taken the time out of my busy day to write a review for a restaurant....but this is how BAD they are. I'll be contacting the news to see if we can get a segment about the horrible owners and consistent mistakes this restaurant makes. STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service...generous portions...decent prices...cozy and intimate setting...delicious sushi and iced matcha green tea! The sashimi tuna is to die for and the salmon is like buttah."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality of sushi and terrible service. Definitely won't come back or recommend."}
{"text":"Nice little Japanese restaurant. Has a good selection of sushi, sashimi, noodle dishes and drinks (full bar!).  It is not top notch sushi, but fair quality and very tasty. Dinner for four with a drink ran me about $60.  Not too shabby."}
{"text":"Experience the difference.

It's official, Tomo Japanese Cuisine is my favorite sushi restaurant in the Phoenix Metro area, and I have frequented many sushi establishments on my quest for deliciously fresh sushi.

Today, my friends and I stopped by Tomo Japanese for dinner, and I must admit the atmosphere and sushi did not disappoint. Tomo Japanese is clean, the staff is very friendly, acomadating, and the food is fresh and delicious.

We sampled different types of sushi, and sushi rolls, all of which were fresh  quality cuts. All our entrée's were  creatively crafted, and very reasonably priced, particularly at happy hour. 

Tomo Japanese offers generous portions, enough for two but you will want to finish your entrée all yourself.  I highly recommend the Tuna Sashimi, Salmon, or Dragon Roll sushi all are absolutely delicious.  

So if you happen to find yourself in the area and have a  hankering for delicious Sushi, then stop in and feast on delicious food served by some very nice people."}
{"text":"TOMO has the best sushi. Every time we go we order one new idea we've not tried before. This is a great way to experiment. Everything's amazing at TOMO. The restaurant is clean, wonderful staff, your food comes out quick and its freshly made to order."}
{"text":"It was busy and took time to get our order. We didn't drink so just got water and the waitress didn't come by very often. She took our order, we ate and after asking someone to bring our check she finally comes, but to pick up the check that was already given to us by someone else. Service was slow, Sushi was delicious! 

We had a Goodyear roll and of course the Las Vegas roll both were great! 

We also got the pork gyoza and shrimp tempura. 

The gyoza were tiny and very salty. The shrimp tempura was pretty good but had the tail end of the shrimp still in it fried which I wasn't used to. 

They have a great happy hour selection! We will be coming back to this ace pretty soon!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but the service here is terrible! They do this \"shared tables\" where every server works every table so half the time you have no service and the other half you are constantly bothered. Amazing food but I had to stop going here after the second time I ended up walking out after 10-15 minutes of not even having my drink order taken when it wasn't even busy!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok.

Service was poor!

I ordered udon stir fry noodles and barely any noodle in it and we got no napkins either! The sushi chef should smile more.
I also order bbq ribs and it never showed up, until I went and ask the sushi chef to check on it. Never coming back again!"}
{"text":"This is a fun little place for sushi and other Japanese cuisine. My wife and I went for a late lunch. I ordered a Tomo special sushi roll. The roll was excellent except for the fact that it was just too big. The slices were too thick the the overall diameter of the roll was huge. Sushi is a \"one bite\" piece but you literally could not get a whole piece in your mouth. we each ordered a lunch bento which were very good. Overall the experience was enjoyable. Service was fair but somewhat inattentive based on the numbers of customers in the place. Food quality/taste was good. Prices are very high. we may visit again but I think we'll try some other places first."}
{"text":"I've found that some sushi places are pretty good. But Tomo's is a mark above the rest. First off is the look and feel of an establishment when you walk in. Which is exactly what you receive when you walk right through the front door. 

There are of course many ways to enjoy sushi, but I have found that at the sushi bar itself. Where you actually get to see the art that they out into their creations is the best seat of the house. 

There are of course multiple selections that one may order. And whatever you do receive. I must add that it's never skimpy. Unlike most places where they cut thin. Tomo's provide a nice thick slice. Perfectly balanced and ensured that you actually are able to taste their fresh fish creation and not just the sauce that is drizzled upon them. 

Of course the staff must be mentioned as well. They don't push, and they are quite patient. I'm not one if the quickest people when it comes to ordering so its very genuine when you don't hear or see the wait staff looking away as they wait for u place their order. One if the most humblest of trademarks. 

In conclusion, it is a very nice modest establishment. Why not 5 stars you ask. While the fish, rice and sauces are great and wonderful together. It is what we eat most of that has a little lack, the rice. Dry, no sweetness. No flavor as u would expect to receive, even in preparation and cooking. Rice itself has some balance. The tempura on the spider roll I had was not the crunchy kind you'd expect. It felt a little soggy. 

And so I would suggest for those that would like to enjoy a nice thick serving of tempura to fly, drive and stop by. Only with more tastes and people can they truly improve upon perfection."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best places I have ever eaten at. 

The prices are really good and they have a good happy hour for drinks and appetizers. I think this place is much better quality food then most sushi places and its a lot cheaper. The atmosphere is also very pleasant. The service is outstanding and always friendly. 

The sushi is the best here. They have a large menu, all very tasty and well worth the visit. I love sushi, and this place is by far the best.. If you are looking for a good time with some great food this is your place."}
{"text":"TRY THE MONKEY BALLS ROLL!!

This place is really good! They have a great happy hour menus for food and drinks! 

The atmosphere is somewhat dark, yet appropriate for the culture they are trying to express. I came here is a friend, and we both thought the rolls on the happy hour menu were very reasonably priced. 

I tried the Monkey Balls Roll. It was absolutely amazing! Its made with mushrooms and salmon and some other stuff then it's deep fried into a great deliciousness.

I also ordered a saki bomber, which was also on happy hour. All in all this place was actually pretty cool. I would like to come back here and grab the monkey balls off the happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent bar and sushi. Happy hour on food daily between 3 and 6. Half price rolls and other dishes. Try the baked muscles and poke salad. Very good."}
{"text":"Love the Happy hour special and Lobster roll is very good. The service is great been there when its slow and crazy pack and was taken care every time best sushi rolls in west valley.."}
{"text":"The service was terrible we waited for ever to have the waitress take our order and she never came back to check on us. We waited and were starving, and to make matters worse they charged our credit card twice for a very over priced meal. It was a shame the food was good, but I would never go back due to terrible service!"}
{"text":"Food is usually pretty good!. However, I came in just before 3pm for the lunch special that is from 11-3pm. Was told after I ordered that I was too late for the lunch special as I'm staring at my phone that says 3pm. Not very accommodating to the customer.  Seems that's the trend here. Decently good food with poor service."}
{"text":"So we came here for sushi but after seeing the prices, we decided on Teryaki bowls.  The sushi prices were rarely below $11 a role which seemed a bit on the high point.

My GF got the chicken teriyaki bowl and I had the Salmon Teryaki bowl.  My GF said it was the best she had, chicken was grilled and tasted fresh.  My salmon was cooked perfectly and the bowl was excellent.  

We did order a Spider Role to share and I was not impressed.  The crab was literally burned and overwhelmed the taste of the whole roll.  We didn't even finish it.

Overall we would go elsewhere for sushi but the bowls are excellent.  Place is very nice and very clean.  Good atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi spot in the valley.  For frequent visitors they start to know your preferences even over the phone.  Great quality and timeliness with orders."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. This place was recommended by a friend. We went for lunch and I had the bento lunch. Their bento is amazing!!! Worth the price! But their service is slow. We had three different servers for lunch which was interesting (unusual) but their food is good. My friend said her ramen soup was okay but if you visit here get their bento, affordable and tasty!!"}
{"text":"It's proven study that sushi makes the heart and stomach happy.

Okay, I made that up but it sounds about right. Anywho, I seriously love this place. My favorite things to get are the monkey balls, the Dysart Roll, and Ocean Salad. When I'm craving for spice, the Ninja Jalapeños deliver.

I really wish they would bring back the oyster shooters. That thing was soooo delicious!!! Also I love the decorations at this place, so nice and cozy!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Tomo has a seaweed salad that is full of flavor! Small size is good for about two! Their sushi is always on point! I've had the beauty, rock n roll, Hawaiian volcano, spicy tuna,etc. 
All of these are delicious! 
Oh and if you don't have time to stop by or you have kids like us. Why don't you call ahead and pick up your order instead!"}
{"text":"This place is honestly a hit and miss for me.  

One time I go and I find myself overeating all of the goodness.  Then the next time I go it's as if they've never rolled a sushi roll in their lives!

When it's on...it's on! I enjoy the different rolls they have to offer.  

Service is one thing that they could improve upon.  Some of these kids need a lesson in communication skills.  Eye contact.  Smiles. Acknowledgement.  These things get you a tip.  They also bring people back."}
{"text":"Yum!!!!! This place is great we have been about 5 times so far and each time it is perfect! Service was great and food is fresh and fabulous!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious.  Service not great at all. Sushi came quickly & was awesome.  Kitchen food (steak teriyaki bowl) took Half an Hour!  The waitress came over after 25 min & said \"the r taking 20% off my entree.  Gee thanks, a whole $1.39
Maybe comp the patrins meal who waits half hr for bowl of rice & steak"}
{"text":"Really good Japanese Food. This place is always busy. Food is good, atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"The prices are good and the food is fine, if you can get service in this place.  The last few times I went, it took my kids and me almost 2 hours to order, eat and pay.  And trust me, this was not on our end.  We couldn't even flag down our servers because they disappear in the back.  We only went back because we didn't know of any other sushi places in the area.  Well, we do now and will never return to this place again."}
{"text":"Great food and Great prices!!!  My family of 4 eats for about 20 bucks!!  We are regulars!!!"}
{"text":"They get 1 star due to their poor, poor service. We  waited 15 min for them to take our order. We have been there in past and their service is pretty good when it's slow. Unfortunately, as soon as they get busy you are lucky if they remember you're there. The couple next to us had the same issue."}
{"text":"The quality of food is just okay. I used to really like this place but the service is absolutely horrible. You literally sit and wait for 10-15 minutes before a waiter or waitress has the decency to ask you for your drink order. It takes them forever to get your food out to you. They don't come and refill drinks. I've literally walked up and asked the take out people to refill drinks, ask for extra utensils, booster seat for my daughter and endless other items. This place is a joke. Take your hard earned money elsewhere. I'll give them two stars just because their food is okay."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Prices weren't too bad. Waitress was forgetful and didn't place our order properly which was disappointing. She left in the middle of our meal and had to ask several times for wasabi, ginger, drink refills and even our check when we were ready to leave. May come back or try takeout since the food was quite good."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for 8+ yrs. The food is tasty and the service is impeccable! Clean, friendly atmosphere. I had my birthday dinner here and my guests loved it too. You will not be disappointed.:)"}
{"text":"I've gone hear twice in the past month.  I was in the area for work and needed some good food.  I like the fact that it is dark inside.  It is very soothing.  Beautiful decor.  The food was very good and the service was good as well.  Close to five stars for me, but I've only had limited time to experience Tomo.  I look forward to coming back and having more time to try additional items.  FWIW, I've been eating sushi for thirty years and know the good from the bad.  This is the good.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hello all.

We tried this place about a week ago, being in the area. I really wanted some ramen and had been craving it for awhile. The reviews were off-putting but I did still want to give it a try and see for myself.

We came in and was greeted immediately and sat. That was great. The decor looked awesome from what I could see. It was the middle of the day but the windows were all blocked up and the lighting was very, VERY dim. Please get more light in the place.

I think our server's name was Bryan. She was kind of very laid back and actually didn't say too much. We asked for a few minutes to go over the menu as we had never been before. She said ok and went about her business. It felt like awhile before she actually came back to us. But since I didn't really pay attention to that, I'm not going to hold it against her.

We placed our orders. One tonkotsu ramen and one shoyu ramen, please! Also add one deep fried spicy tuna roll and one california. Awesome!

The orders were brought out by different people, not our server. (the place wasn't really busy). Our server actually walked by us a few times and didn't even garner a 'how you doing?' So idk if she wasn't wanting to be there today or whatever but we did see her take other people's orders the same way. Just monotone. 

Anyway, the deep fried tuna sushi was good. I don't think I ever hide it like that before so it kind of tasted like beef. Still good, though!

Now the ramen... those were really disappointing. The portions were great, just how it usually is in any place... but the broth... the pork broth (I even questioned if it was pork broth) was completely watered down. There was absolutely no flavor in it at all. It was like a bowl of water with noodles in it. Like... what? And the noodles? Way over done. It was like water decided to be solid. You have no idea how much soy sauce I had to sprinkle to give me something I could work with.

At least the pork belly was good.

My wife's shoyu ramen? Same thing! NO FLAVOR and over done noodles. Usually it's a little salty because of the soy sauce based broth but I would've killed for some salt right here. It wasn't great.

Oh btw, Bryan never showed back up until it was time for the check. Other people running around got us water refills and whatnot but Bryan didn't bother with us. It think it was the bussers that actually helped us more. Like dude...

Anyway, I'm sure the owner/s are great people but you have a weak link here. I'm sure the kitchen should taste their broth too.

Maybe I need to come when there's a good cook in the house?

But reality, we probably won't try again. :("}
{"text":"The service is so horrible! The hosted showed us to our seats then come back and threw the menu on the table at us. Then we had to wait for our food for 30min when the place was not that crowded. Our waitress was very nice but it would take her 15 minutes to get our drinks. Which is funny because we had 6 waitresses passing by our table Nd none of them bother to get us or drinks. The food started pretty good until I got the spider role and it was completely burned. Not only that but after the manager came and took the role but they still tried to charge me for it. My whole experience was horrible."}
{"text":"I was a 1-2x per week regular for almost 3 years. Until today. I called my order in like any other day. I'm told 20-25 minutes and my order will be done. Cool. I arrive exactly 20 mins later and pay. I'm told 10 more minutes, due to there only being 2 sushi chefs on staff tonight. Meh, ok fine. 15 mins go by and nothing. I ask the ETA and am told \"a couple more minutes.\" After 5 minutes i see my order getting bagged up...but no...one of the rolls is missing. 10 minutes later i stand up and go to the counter. \"Mom\" as the staff calls her goes to the chefs to inquire about my missing roll. 5 minutes later it still isnt out. I ask for a discount on the order due to the time. Short staffed? Ok, but don't tell me my order will be done in 20-25 minutes and almost an hour later it still isn't done. Three tables worth of people walked in, sat doen and got their food. I ordered my food to go 20 minutes before I even got there and this happened? Mind you, i come to this place so often that the veteran staff knows my order just by my voice. \"Mom\" gave me $4 for the inconvenience, but I am so disappointed. 

Food is good. Prices are ok and the wait staff is hit and miss. If you go and get CeCe as your waitress, tip her well. She bends over backwards for her customers. Anyone else is a box of rocks. And apparently being a regular doesnt mean much."}
{"text":"Food was not too bad. A bit salty but what was really noticeable was the service. We walk in and wonder if we seat ourselves or not. A lady in all black walk up to us but in a way where she may be saying hi to someone in the party or about to seat is. She asked an a quiet voice \"how many.\" After being seated another waitress ask if we want miso. I know what miso is but everyone was unsure if she was asking if we wanted the paste or the soup. It was the soup and we all had a laugh including the waitress. Next to us was a stool bar where u face the chefs making the roll. An employee was sitting there drinking Jamba juice... It seemed to me that the employees very customer focused."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour!
Best value in the west valley for drinks and sushi! Every day from 3-6 pm! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was trying to get here before happy hour ended, I made it with 20 mins to spare!  WHOOO!  I ordered chicken yakatori!  YUM!  SO SO SO good.  Flavorful and not too sweet.  Awesome way to kick off the meal.  L was already there and got rolls and chicken wings.  I did not have any rolls but I had an Asian chicken wing.  YUM!  I ordered a Curry Katsu Pork.  Hello curry GODs.  Perfection!!!  The taste of the curry was outstanding!  Why the 4 stars?  Service was slow and lacking."}
{"text":"Loved the bartender at this place! She was so cheerful and pleasant! She can probably give the hostess some tips on how to greet people. Food was delicious! The restaurant is someway dark inside makes the place look elegant!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  Miso soup was awesome, but service lacked a bit. Will still go back for more!"}
{"text":"I recommend this place to anyone trying to find a new sushi spot. The atmosphere is great and so is the service. I had gone there 10 minutes before the sushi hour  ended but it was packed so we had to wait to be seated but when we sat down the hour of short prices was over. They had still gave us the short prices since we were there before sushi hour ended which was great. Their sushi is also fantastic and delicious. I go there quite often due to the great service and sushi and their other meals so I highly recommend Tomo."}
{"text":"Was told to hurry up and order got there at 10 doesn't close until 1030. Refuse to vist again. What a way to greet your customers."}
{"text":"We had great sushi here! Although the table presentation wasn't quite as elegant as some other shops, the selection was extensive and the sushi delicious. The place has a classy feel--love the bar--and it's a nice departure from some other restaurants in the West Valley. Try the O-Mojoto, the baby lobster and of course the Tomo Special.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We love Tomo!! Great Sushi, love the Vegas roll and the crunch roll!  Great Happy Hour as well!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Food is great and the service is exceptional!! The happy hour is fantastic and the bartender Pookie makes you feel like so welcome!! If you haven't been here I'd highly recommend trying it, best overall experience in the West Valley!!!"}
{"text":"The Crazy is quite good the spicy tuna is not overtly spicy, so ask for wasabi. My daughter still likes the sesame chicken. I got seated right away. I feel like giving this place another chance."}
{"text":"Another great experience here at Tomo. This time I got to try the Phoenix roll and Sunset roll. Both were amazing. I'm going to leave this review short because by the amount of stars given, you can already get an idea of how great this place is. Try Tomo if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Went there fr a saturday nite dinner wt the girlfriend nd was completely satisfied wt the food, the place was clean nd the food was over the top.. I had the sunset nd she had the spicy ninja.. Would reccomend this place to anyone thats a big sushi lover since i dnt eat it that much.. Also good customer service..."}
{"text":"My Sisters and I went here tonight just to have dinner and talk. when we arrived it was pretty busy and we were seated fairly quickly, so kudos to them for that. The host seated us in the corner and pretty much forgot about us. We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order. We didn't even have water. Mind you, by this time it had died down and wasn't that busy. We were contemplating on just walking out but we were all hungry. so I got up and walked over to one of the waiters and asked him to come take our order. I sat back down, waited a little longer and finally he came a took our order ( Let's call him waiter #1). We ordered a Vegas roll, a Crunch roll, and a Chicken plate WITH RICE. After we placed our order, 5 minutes later walks up the Host and he asks if we've been helped. Uh, where were you like 20 minutes ago? We waited about 10-15 minutes for the chicken plate to get to our table and different waiter brings it to us (waiter #2). No rice... before we could even ask about the rice the waiter was gone. so about 10 minutes after that, our sushi plates get to the table, but a different waiter brings it to us (waiter #3).and my Vegas roll was not even hot or warm. It was like when you stick your food in the microwave for 10 seconds, it heats up a little bit but it's not quite there. yeah.. disappointing. We then ask this waiter to bring us the rice. After he brings us the rice, he leaves and no other waiter asks us anything from that time to the time we finished our food. Finally waiter #1 comes back and asks us if we wanted refills. After all that, we were finished and ready to pay, It took us so long just to get someone to give us our check, but they were so quick to get their money. We didn't even have time to properly put the money into the book before Waiter #3 comes up to us asking if we needed change and we Finally leave. I don't think I'll be going back there. It was more or less an hour from the time we sat down to the time we got our food. AN HOUR... seriously? We felt like they catered to all the other customers and they just walked right by us. After reading some of the reviews, I'm not the only one who has experienced bad service with this place. To me, the Experience of the restaurant is 50/50. 50% Quality and taste of food, 40% Service and 10% atmosphere. If there's shitty service you're not going to enjoy your food, no matter how nice it looks. I gave them 2 stars because the food was pretty good and it restaurant looks nice.

Overall-

FOOD: 3/5
Tasty. Though my Vegas roll wasn't too hot, or warm for that matter.

SERVICE: 0/5
Hated it, Deal breaker

ATMOSPHERE: 3/5
Nice, dim and calm."}
{"text":"As far as Sushi spots go, this is a cut above the rest. The quality of the food is top notch, I come for the sushi , I can't say that I'm a sushi expert but I can attest that the rolls are right, the fish is cold (when it's supposed to be) and the size of each item is appropriate. Some places skimp and bring you a skinny roll, others overdue with rice, these guys are right on the money! 

Try the oiyoshi (sp?):  a chilled cucumber wrapper with tuna and crab nestled inside. It's a different and fun texture.... cold crunchy cucumber is a badass way to transport tuna into your belly!"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour specials and the rolls and drinks were delish! Can't beat $2 drinks and cheap huge delish rolls. It's definitely good for those times when you want a fancy tempura-ized ginormous roll. The regular prices looked reasonable....yum.... will be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Sushi and fried rice is absolutely mouth watering if I could eat here every day I would... always looking forward to our next visit because we always leave full and satisfied"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for sushi. I've tried a lot of other sushi places and this place is the best. Their rolls are always consistent and good. They also have other dishes besides sushi if you're going with someone who doesn't eat sushi. Their green tea ice cream is good too."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service and the management. Never been here before. Went with a friend. We arrived and were seated. Ordered our water. And took some time to look over the menu. (couple got seated next to us)
We finally get our order in. I have 2 rolls and my friend wants 2 rolls. We wait....the couple next to us orders and gets their rolls first. Then my rolls arrive. Figured my friends rolls should be up any second. 5min go by, nothing.
We ask someone what's taken so long. Our server returns and says she forgot to put the order in but it should be right up. 10min go by, then 15min. The couple next to us pays and leaves. We have now been here 45min. Was suppose to be a quick bite. My friend goes to complain to the manager, at this point no rolls yet. She nicely informs him of the situation and his response is, \"What do you want me to do about it\"? Very poor manager skills. Never have I had a manger respond not my problem to a customer before. My friend said when her rolls did come that she shouldnt have to pay for them because of the long wait. The manager refused and even got upset about it. (Not sure why?) What happened next was just crazy. He says he's going to call the police because it is robbery. How is it robbery? The rolls aren't on the table. When they did arrive he wanted to take one away cause he said he would only pay for one. But two where ordered. So why would you take it away? You never want to think it is because I am a person of color and this is why you are acting this way toward me but in this case it really seemed that was deal. Why else call the cops because you provided bad service. My friend and I did nothing but be patient and wait for our food and express our dislike of service. It was pretty simple fix. But it escalated to something it should not have been. Shame on you-Not to mention they are overpriced and the food isnt even that good. I wont be given my business to them again."}
{"text":"I came here this past Friday evening and was unimpressed, mainly because of customer service issues.  

We had a decent size group- about eight people.  They brought us all out miso soup, on the house (not sure why, but I'm not complaining) which turned out to be your standard miso soup.  We eventually all were able to order, and our server never confirmed our order with us, just whisped away with the sheet.  Quite a few people were having adult beverages, and the waitstaff was not quick on the uptake of actually getting these to our table.  Waters were also left unattended frequently.

I wouldn't have minded the experience so much, but about half of the table got their rolls a good 15-20 minutes before the other half did.  I realize we were a big group, but a 20 minute gap between serving everyone's food?  Pretty unacceptable.  My spicy tuna roll was nothing special, but I was starving by the time I got it, so it went quickly.

On another note, for some reason, Tomo is allowed to charge 10.3 sales tax (I'm pretty sure it should be 8%).  I had a different experience than another reviewer down below- they were just fine with splitting up the bill as long as we wrote down amounts with each specific card.

I'd say, its fine to go here with one or two other people but don't attempt the big group sushi outing at Tomo."}
{"text":"Consistent quality and average price for a sushi place.  Just wish they had real wasabi, I love that stuff."}
{"text":"food is fantastic. Greta Sushi Chef YIN he is awesome. Order the Bento A for lunch and it will fill you up. 

only issue is the music... ugh

decor is beautiful

yummy sushi and tempura. great miso soup. good value"}
{"text":"I love Tomo but their food is really expensive. They said it would take 10 minutes to make my order, it took around 30-45 minutes for three rolls and a salad. That's ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"Seating is not very good. If you go before sundown be sure and get a spot that does not face the door.  Every time the door opens you will be blinded by the sun. Food is ok. Always ask for fresh ground wasbe it is very good."}
{"text":"Extreemly great servive love most of their fried susshi. Nice scenery a little dark but the xmas lights make up for it.perfect for a date. Inexpensive:) one of my favorite places to go for sushi"}
{"text":"I gave it 3 stars only because the food was extremely delicious, I ordered California rolls and the Dysart. The service needed to be better!! We waiting 15 mins just to get our order taken then another 15 for our food to come out then the waitress asked if we wanted ginger and wasabi I replied yes she never brought it my sister had to go up and ask someone for it! Then my other sister came late so she was waiting to order her food and the waitress put the order in wrong so my sister asked to send it back and  a lady took it back and a different lady brought it back rudely blaming her saying it's her fault she chose this. I was very disappointed because I loved this place. I wasn't even mad when they spilled a drink all over me and my phone! They were extremely remorseful so I let it slide But the attitude and bad service is the last straw!"}
{"text":"food is ok... if you don't mind waiting what seems like an eternity attempting to flag someone down to take your order. used to be one of my favorite places to eat, but the SERVICE IS SO HORRENDOUS my family & I will not be returning. They delivered our order (incomplete, because the rest \"didn't go through in the computer\") with no chopsticks, forks, napkins, ginger or wasabi just to have an artificial blonde roll her eyes at me when we asked for eating utensils and our waiter never returned... smh."}
{"text":"Service was awful. Waited forever for Everything. It was hot as hell this day and asked for ice water after waiting 10 minutes when sat, also ordered other drinks ....waited & waited, got the alcoholic drinks & no water. Had to ask another server for ice water, came to me with like 4 tiny ice cubes, Lol. My California roll arrived looking very plain, had to ask for the wasabi & ginger. Waited to eat 10 min while waiting for utensils. The monkey balls would have been better if they weren't drowned in the spicy mayo, it was way too much. We had 4 different people during our visit serving us, which was very confusing. There were a lot of flies too, and was constantly shooing them away. Only things that were good were the shrimp tempura & my martinis. Happy hour pricing is great, but the bad service is not worth it, and the quality of sushi I had was not good."}
{"text":"Food wise,I still love Tomo. I love everything on their menu, the fish is always fresh and delicious. I always get and order of the tuna tartar, which is a sushi mountain of everything right about sushi. My go to sushi spot in the west valley.

Reason for my lesser review, is just the service. It has always been slow, but it is getting even slower. Our lunch took nearly 2 hours and most of that time was spent awkwardly waiting. I have had our server before, and I honestly think she's great. I think the problem is that they are extremely under staffed usually only 1-2 servers on at a time. Get your servers some help! So they can make more money, and have happy guests.

I still recommend Tomo, just dont come if you're trying to make a movie or lunch break and bring your patients, it may take long, but they will take care of you and you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Omg I'm new in this state and let me tell u both my husband and I love sushi and we had gone to other sushi places around here but nothing like this one its definitely bomb.. food was great service was fabulous the waitress were really friendly helpful place is really clean we both loved it"}
{"text":"Instead of going to a sushi place next door to my hotel, I drove an extra 10 minutes to Tomo based on Yelp reviews.  Unfortunately, this was a mistake.  The food was fine, not great and not bad.  On top of that, the food took a while to come.  The restaurant didn't look too busy, but it still took a while.  Once I finished my main meal, I ordered two pieces of nigiri to finish on. It took over 20 minutes to get my last 2 pieces.  

Not a bad place, but not worth 4 stars in my book."}
{"text":"The teriyaki chicken is my fav...i don't like sushi! My fiance loves sushi and this is his fav. place!  Happy hour has great deals as well!!"}
{"text":"Everything is always fresh...phoenix and spicy tuna roll are my favorite...happy hour is a must 2 dollar drafts 5 dollar martinis u cant go wrong"}
{"text":"The Oyshi roll, tuna tataki salad & superman hand roll are my absolute fav! This restaurant is beyond words, hands down the BEST sushi I have ever had. I recommend it to all sushi lovers, nothing compares to this place. Love the staff, the atmosphere, the bar and the location. Everyone is so friendly. I try to visit at least once a week. You will not be disappointed, promise!! I never am!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking fir a turely authentic Japenese Restaurant with great food, friendly faces and awesome Sake, Tomo's doesn't disappoint. Sushi is so fresh and the atmosphere is very invitkng. Great place to take the whole family."}
{"text":"Came here because of the Yelp reviews on how good the Sushi was. It lived up to what I read. My Yellowtail Sashimi was VERY good and my spicy tuna roll was also as good. I look forward to coming again."}
{"text":"By far my most favorite sushi bar ever; beats out Ra & Kabuki. Their Happy Hour is the best; 3-7p Saturdays included! Their staff if great, although it seems they have a lot of new servers. They offer complimentary Miso soup which you rarely see anywhere else. LOVE their Vegas & Spicy Ninja rolls; great size/portions."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for a drink & appetizers. The spicy asian wings, fried rice  and yakitori chicken are some of my favorites along with their Tokyo Tea!"}
{"text":"First time here. The portions were small(compared to other places) the food however, tasted amazing! We will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  i had no expectations when it came to Tomo since the outside looks small and lonely, it was delicious!  The ninja roll is my favorite! We also enjoy the teriyaki chicken plate. It's peaceful and the lights are dimmed, it creates a soothing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good food but terrible service.  have been here twice and both times we were very disappointed with the staff. I asked for a simple change in a sushi roll and the waitress said that they don't do any changes  on the roll unless it's not busy. How can they not accommodate a paying customer? Especially when it's something that's gonna save them money in the long run? 

I have given this place three chances. Sorry Tomo but this may be the very last time I spend my hard earned money on you. And I'm a VERY good tipper and spender. I'll be taking my cash somewhere else."}
{"text":"Used to really love this place. The food is good, but the service could definitely improve. The people who work here are unfriendly and when they attempt to be friendly it's fake. When asking for wasabi, ginger, etc.. it takes quite a long time to arrive. Other than that I still eat here even with the service."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to grab some dinner before we ran to the store on Saturday, and with the help of yelp, we found Tomo. I have probably drive by Tomo hundreds of times and never gave it a second thought. Glad we found this on yelp. I ordered a sushi sampler with a spicy tuna roll and it was very good. My wife had ordered the \"Goodyear\" roll, and it was amazing. I have to say I was shocked at the quality of the sushi, and the amazing presentation. My Sapporo can in a cold chiller with ice dancing up the bottle, it was very nice and kept my beer nice and cold during dinner (always a fine point with me). 

There are a few choices for Sushi in the West Valley, but this one is a nice combo of price and quality. Is it the best? Not in my opinion, but it is the best value you'll find."}
{"text":"Awesome food.   The service was terrible. We had to ask for everything. We sat at the bar and the server forgot about us. One tea pot because the other one was broken. We did not order dessert because no one asked us. My husband had to take the check to the cashier. We are not returning to the restaurant!"}
{"text":"We either do take out or take in at least once a week. We love this place! The sushi is always fresh and I have no complaints on the service or pricing. The jackpot roll is my personal favorite and a great deal for how much food you get! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love Tomo! Of all the times I've been here I've never had a bad experience. Staff is always friendly and attentive. Food is always on point and the portion size is perfect. Happy hour specials are by far the best around."}
{"text":"Tomo's has been open for a year. It is near the corner of W McDowell and Dysart, in a Lowe's big box mall. 

It is Korean owned, managed and the sushi chefs are all Korean, too.
They spent quite a bit on decor, and it reminds me a bit like a Scottsdale type establishment in decor, but considerably cheaper food than your RA's or Sapporo in upscale Snotsdale. 

It is large, with a Z shaped sushi bar with a high counter. Jay is the main sushi chef, Jason the second, and although he is middle aged Korean, he learned the trade in Cambridge, MA from an older Japanese chef. He has also plied his trade in Irvine, La Canada and Santa Barbara, CA before coming out to Goodyear. This is the only Japanese restaurants in this neck of the valley. 

The bar area has large red paper lanterns, and you can order sushi while guzzling your favorite adult beverage. In the dining area, the sushi bar is decorated with bamboo covered lanterns. The surfaces are of solid heavy materials. A copper 3/4 moon platter designates each sushi bar seat. 

As is typical of a made-for-Americans-Korean-owned Japanese sushi bar, you order off the check list menu, which is handed to the chef. Jay served my nigiri selctions in rectangular platers of heavy ceramic. The dishware was modern and esthetically attractive. The sushi was OK for Goodyear, but certainly not to major coastal city standards. The prices were perhaps a tiny bit high, perhaps to pay for the decor.

The dining area has 3 plasma TVs: 2 showing sports, and the center one running a commercial for Tomo itself, with names and pictures of Chefs, and colorful pix of some of their signature appetizers (i.e. baked green mussels) and sushi rolls (the regulars plus others)

It is funny, even though I could pass for a Mexican Terrorist, they were initially suspicious of me, like I was scoping the place out to open a competitive restaurant in the area. Maybe because I only ordered nigiri. They relaxed after I kept reassuring them. 

You are served miso shiro right away and a crispy salad after that, included. They charge for green tea, though, $1.95! But then, the couple to the left and right of me both drank large sodas with their sushi! Maybe with Safeway sushi, but dining out? Well, it is Goodyear AZ after all, not known for its restaurants or epicurean elite. 

Service was excellent on this slower Monday, with at least 2 waitresses checking on me constantly. Beerand cold sake bottles are served in wooden bowls filled with shaved ice ...nice touch. 

For Goodyear, this is a good choice. It is clean, pleasant, with nice decor and ok sushi. They also offer other Japanese dishes."}
{"text":"Having lived in Japan for 5 years, I've been highly critical of American Japanese food... but this place makes my top 2 list of Phoenix-area favorites. While the food is  not 100% authentic, their restaurant philosophy is: fresh, quality ingredients, well-made meals, traditional Japanese food combinations, excellent service and clean atmosphere. BTW--dishes (~ $10-15 ea) are filling! (That's an American thing. LOL) 
I will definitely be coming back. 
Thank you to the management for putting quality first in a world of \"quantity is king\"."}
{"text":"Flavored sake?! Who knew! Cheap sake bombers and their sushi isn't too bad especially during happy hour. Puky, the bartender is real nice."}
{"text":"Spicy ninja roll is the only reason why I keep coming here. The happy hour pricing and the lunch portions and pricing are a bargain. Service sometimes lacks but the food is good"}
{"text":"So, I have to start with saying that the food is wonderful!  This has been a favorite for 4 years. I love the Phoenix roll and the Spicy ninja appetizer...yum!!  

The service is very hot and cold. Sometimes super nice - others I felt like I was bothering them.  The food still outweighed the service issue. 

BUT...unfortunately I will never return due to the bad service and bad experience.  
Coworkers threw me a surprise party due to an upcoming wedding.  I accidentally left a gift on the table. Upon my return of course it wasnt there nor located in the lost and found.   I filed a claim at the store for the gift card - unfortunately it had been used. I went back to speak to the owner and he shut me down.  I asked for him to review video simply to see if he could find out who took it.  He told me the he had no liability for lost items and wouldnt review.  He became defensive although I was asking for his help, not accusing him nor his employees.  I was completely shut down and he told me he didnt care if i returned.  Very disappointing.  Im clearly not a valued client nor will i return.  Nakama...here I come."}
{"text":"So I have been going here for years and sadly the service and quality of food just keeps getting worse. When Tomo's first opened, it was great! Food was wonderful, service was great and overall it was a really good atmosphere. The last few times I have gone whether is was busy or not, the service was terrible, such as forgetting to put an order in or the food taking forever to get to our table. The food has become mediocre  since the prices have increased and the restaurant always seems to be understaffed."}
{"text":"Really good sushi, super fast and attentive service. Awesome tuna rolls, very creative menu that includes pictures of every roll. Highly recommend to any sushi fan!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service
Got the kitchen boat and I didn't receive the rice whilst eating. The plate come in parts and at different times. Near the end of my visit I realized we never received the rice, which I brought to the waitress' attention. I also pointed out the fact that I never received yet another part of the meal-- the tempura ice cream. Not only was the service bad till then, but she decided that she really didn't want a tip when she walked back simply to say, \"it's because you have to ask for it\". The food is expensive and subpar. The teriyaki chicken tasted as if it had been cooked on a very dirty, burnt grill. The beef was over cooked and chewy, also heavily tasting of char. Do not waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to knock this down to a 3-star review now. We used to love this place, but the past few times have not been so great.

We left to live and work in Japan for a year from Aug. 2012-Aug. 2013; before we left, we had 2 bad experiences at Tomos. The first time, we thought it was just bad luck. They messed up our order, forgot to bring some things out that we had ordered, and still charged us for those forgotten things. The second time was with a gift card we had received from a friend. We went to use it and found out that the person who sold it to our friend never put the money on the card and had pocketed it instead. WOW! We told the owner (I think?) and she said she would take care of it. I trust that she did! ;) 

After returning in 2013, we figured we would give it a try again. We went back and had a bad experience again, over a year later. I had hoped they had fixed the problems while we were gone, but we were sadly disappointed. They forgot to bring us our plain white rice that we had ordered... in a Japanese restaurant. THEY FORGOT THE RICE!!! :P We went back one final time a few months later (2014 now) and had a similar experience where they forgot the rice. By the way, we were charged for the rice both times. They definitely removed it from our bill at the end, but it's crazy.

We used to love this place. The atmosphere is great, the food is great, the drinks are great... but the service is not. The chefs and all the people in the back, plus the bartenders, are awesome, but we have just had terrible experiences with the wait staff. It's unfortunate, but going out to eat is expensive, so I would like to enjoy my entire experience when I do spend my money for someone else to cook food for me! :)

(Edit: Forgot to mention that the past several times we went, they switched servers on us at least 2 or 3 times... insane! I bet that's why the orders get messed up. After looking at other reviews, it doesn't seem like we were the only people to have experienced this poor service here. Unfortunate!)"}
{"text":"I will reiterate what many others have said. Food is above average. Service is poor. We've been there half a dozen times and besides waiting a long time for our food, they almost always forget something or bring us the wrong food. With better servers/server training, this place could be 4 stars easy."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends last night. We had such terrible service for the most part. I was the first to get there from my party and let the girl that greeted me know I was waiting for friends and I wasn't sure if we had a reservation or not. She led me to a table and I told her what the name would be under and she responded \"we only have one reservation so this must be it.\" So we sat. Our party got there. Midway through our dinner we are approached and asked if our reservation was under \"Pablo\". We tell them no and they sigh and roll their eyes at us. So uncomfortable and rude. My husband gets up to use the restroom to find out they had nothing, no toilet paper no paper towels, so he'll just wait. Our waiter that we started off with was really nice. But his shift ended before we were done. We let him know from the beginning we were splitting the check and he was more than helpful about getting everyone's request in order. But I guess that info didn't get passed on before he left because the lady with tattoos all over her arm came to help us after he left and was rude and annoyed that we had split checks. A couple showed up towards the end and she wouldn't give them time to look over the menu, pushing them to hurry up. She was beyond rude. So disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaraunt for five years now and the ONLY thing that brings me coming back is the food. The wait staff are HORRIBLE!!
They try to hire new girls and they always are terrible. The chefs on the other hand are amazing. I've decided to sit at the sushi bar to entertain myself rather than get annoyed with the crappy wait staff."}
{"text":"I agree with Raymond, place must be under new management because the service and food was amazing! My only complaint is the same as Nakama, which is in the same shopping center, I ordered Sushi, my husband ordered a cooked dish and my food came out about 10 minutes before my husbands and I really wish they would time it better, I think I'll request they bring them out together next time. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Tomo about four times... pretty much every time I had made a visit to Phoenix. It seems to be about the same each time. The food is good but the service is... not the best. It's not terrible but it's just not very good. The last time I went, our server pretty much ignored us the entire time. 

The avocado salad was delicious the last time I had it (two or three years ago?); not sure if it has changed since then. The sushi is average, I think, but on the better end as far as Phoenix sushi goes. I love their bento meals as it offers quite a lot of food for a relatively low price. The sashimi bento is my favorite. I must say, however, that the salad that comes in these meals is pretty terribad. It's pretty much just iceberg lettuce with some really crappy dressing. Their meat is pretty tasty.

I recommend Tomo if you're in the area and craving some sushi but don't expect the most awesome and stellar experience ever. It should be sufficient to satisfy your sushi urges, though."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, decided to give this place a try. I went with a friend during happy hour, we both enjoyed our food and drinks. The service was good. I felt that this place had a nice and relaxing environment. I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"More of a 3 1/2 (3 3/4) - it is probably some of the better Sushi in the valley.  The Tempura is pretty good - and for being in the west valley it makes it even better.  Good service - good food - a good place to go."}
{"text":"They are a little pricey if you don't come for happy hour.. The food we ordered took a while and it was just ok. There wasn't too many people dining and there seemed to be just one server. Maybe an off night?"}
{"text":"Was there on Friday with a friend who was out of state visiting we waited for more than 45 min we ended up walking out because we where not getting service the one star I'm giving is generous"}
{"text":"Tomo's has become our go-to for yummy sushi whether lunch or happy hour. Hubby likes the fried ones like vegas roll and spicy ninja. Everything we try seems to be a good value."}
{"text":"I went back around 5 more times. Yesterday, I tried the Tuna tartare, Udon with tempura, Oyshi roll, and Popcorn lobster roll.

DELICIOUS.

The tuna tartare is soooo good. My husband was even surprised how good it is. It gives your palate so much flavor.

Udon with tempura is also delicious. We've been trying to find some decent udon for a while now. We had a hard time finding good udon compared to the one at Sushi Catcher. THIS IS IT. Their udon is different, but very good. I think I like it more than the one at Sushi Catcher. It has a slight sweet, seaweed flavor to it. The tempura and fish balls that come with it are so yummy too.

Oyshi roll is basically a cucumber roll. It's decent, but I probably wouldn't buy it again. I had better cucumber rolls elsewhere.

The Popcorn lobster roll is interesting. It's literally popcorn lobster on top of a california roll. If they sold the popcorn lobster by itself, I would honestly buy it. It's really good. I don't care much for california roll."}
{"text":"This is my spot. I've never had an issue here. They have a good happy hour from 3p-6p everyday. It gets a little crowded at happy during sports season. The food isn't bad and the drink specials are pretty good. They are family friendly but they do have a bar area in case you want more of a bar vibe. I've been coming back ever since my first experience. Try it out!"}
{"text":"I am from Southern California and coming across good sushi in the west valley has been a challenge to say the least.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a whirl.  I will start with the good.  We walked in and there were probably 4 other tables...pretty light crowd.  The sushi was phenomenal.  It sounds silly, but even the rice was great.  Some of the best sushi rice I have had out here.  Now for the bad.  Like I said, light crowd.  The hostess was more attentive than our waitress.  It took 15 minutes to get our waters.  I needed one more minute to decide what I wanted...that turned into another 15 minutes.  So 30 minutes after we were seated we finally got to order.  My boyfriend got his food, finished it, and ordered dessert.  My friend and I got our sushi when his dessert came out...45 MINUTES from the time we ordered!  We got 3 rolls and an order of white tuna sushi.  We were there for over 2 hours.  The manager comped us for 2 of our rolls (it was happy hour so that only added up to about $8), but he tried to take care of us, and returned to our table several times after to assure that we were satisfied.  Next time I would prefer them telling me that they were short staffed, rather than leaving us hanging.  Because of the quality of the food, great happy hour prices and actions of the manager, I will be returning...hopefully to better service."}
{"text":"EDM + Japanese Curry = Genius  IDK it's the spicy curry that got me sweatin' or the molly!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Tomo for over 5 years. This place is amazing and never disappoints! I have tried other more expensive places and it just doesn't compare. By far the best Japanese restaurant I've ever been too. I have tried their rolls and dishes and have not been disappointed yet. Did I mention happy hour is 3-6 daily!

Besides the food the ambiance is perfect! Low lighting, TVs for all the sports and great music! The staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"The sushi was actually really good, however, if you're a fan of raw fish, don't come here.  Majority of their rolls are cooked, and it's very expensive.  On the other hand, the rolls are huge."}
{"text":"The ambiance here is nice, somewhat chic like, but they also have a large screen tv by the sushi bar for some MNF action. For a sushi joint in the middle of the desert, they had a lot to offer on their menu.

But my first two questions alone confirmed the fact that having a sushi joint in the middle of the desert may have some issues.

Hows the toro? Sorry we dont serve toro during the summer time.
Ok, how about the halibut? No halibut here, only during winter.

So that's a great start there. And yes both items were on the menu; that's why I asked how they were. Oh well.

Anyways, I ordered some tuna nigiri http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=CTl0wonkUIRRANoVogG2BQ, salmon nigiri http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=BvZ7OBpRxsxtH0bF7KE1ug, albacore and yellowtail http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=grNHXCPTzT-ZLcDw75TgwA. They obviously used the best pieces here, nice, vibrant colors and fresh. The rice was a bit off though.

I also ordered their spicy salmon roll. Very hot, they pretty much drowned the fish in siracha sauce. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=HlM6L-jLtZEclnVUc_h2pg

For dessert I ordered a banana tempura with jack Daniels sauce, with ice cream chocolate and whipped cream. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=yZnUTrSRlcDT3SdD2Hb3zg Not bad, nice and sweet.

The service here was neutral. I was the only person at the bar, and maybe like 10 other people in the dining area so it was pretty desolate as it is, but it took some time to get some decent service here. And if you're looking for the best (ie toro, halibut) they may not be there. But then again, this place is in the middle of the desert."}
{"text":"They must be under some new management or something, because the last few times I have gone, I have never had a problem with customer service or the quality of food. 

I was actually ASTONISHED on my last visit because there are now over 100 rolls to choose from. It honestly took my co-worker and I over 10 minutes to look through the entire menu and decide what we wanted. We were both very satisfied. The prices per roll range between $8-12, pretty standard for a sushi place. They were obviously made fresh to order. 

We were also offered free miso soup as well. Let's face it, Miso soup is miso soup, so even though it wasn't amazing, it was free and it's the thought that counts. 

My water must have been re-filled about 4 times, I kid you not. Especially when the place is not super busy, the wait staff is very attentive, even if they aren't your assigned server. 

ONE PLUS...THEY HAVE HAPPY HOUR EVERYDAY!!!! They have $2 drafts of Coors Lite, Miller Lite and one other I think. They also have a good amount of appetizers for $4.95 during happy hour. 

All in all, I wouldn't complain. I will continue to go back."}
{"text":"This is the best Sushi I've tasted. The prices are unbeatable! The staff are soo courteous and the food/drinks are very quick to arrive. Since moving here from CO, this will most definitely be a regular dining experience for us."}
{"text":"Wow! I was there yesterday with my friend and we thought it was really delicious. The service was very nice and fast. We got our sushi like 5 min after ordering. Plus the vibe of the place was very hip. All in all it was a really good experience and I will definately be going back!"}
{"text":"First I have to say, thank you to the staff for being so kind to a party of 9 coming in right before close. Sorry!! The service was exceptional and the food was great. 9/10 would recommend!!"}
{"text":"We visited here on a Thursday at 11:30am. We were quickly seated and taken care of; other reviews describe issues with service, but we didn't have any problems. 

Our waitress offered complementary miso soup as a starter. She brought out both bowls immediately and the soup was quite refreshing.

My husband ordered pork gyoza and the lunch beef teriyaki bowl. He really enjoyed all of it. The amount of meat was good. The gyzoza I had was nice and crisp with a great flavor inside.

I had the tuna tataki salad. Oh, the seared tuna was just fabulous! Nice and fresh. The base of the salad was iceberg lettuce, which I usually don't like, but the crisp leaves actually worked very well with the overall salad. The carrots, asparagus, and sprouts were very good. The amount of dressing was heavy--there was a lake in the bottom of my platter when the salad was done--but since it wasn't a creamy kind of dressing, it didn't drown the flavors in the salad until the very end.

We were pleased with our experience here and hope to visit again!"}
{"text":"Ordered sushi as app and didn't see server again. Eventually new server came by and couldn't answer simple menu questions. Asked for our server and she said they all just worked together. Let her know hadn't had anyone check on us in a long time and she still didn't get us drink refills, seemed bothered that we wanted to order entree. Too bad we won't be back the foodw was great."}
{"text":"First time going last time going there... food ehh.. half of our food took awhile to get the table.. then while waiting for the rest of the food they asked us if we needed anything else like we were done or something.. then we decided to leave once people got sat behind us like 25 after us got thier rolls before us.. bad experience all around"}
{"text":"Tonight was the worst experience I have ever had here it's ridiculous. It went from them putting the wrong rolls on our table, and not even knowing whose it was, and after I asked a random chick I've never seen here before, she says idk and walks away to say hold on, goes over and literally asks all the servers as they stare at our table. After this, the next thing was them then putting the random rolls on our bill, like we were really going to fucking pay for shit we didn't order and were given horrible service by a chick who couldn't even compete a task. Then I walk up asking for joe, the manager, and I waited 20 minutes. I then wait another 15 after asking multiple times by multiple people, and they just kept saying he was busy, who the fuck MANAGES a restaurant to ignore customers??? Get a new job then dude. If someone has a problem, figure it out. They never once took care of our empty plates/spills we had, (we had kids with us) and the only thing our waitress asked was if we kept wanting refills. Like no we just wanted you to do your damn job, that apparently no one was taught here. Log story short, joe NEVER comes out and some old lady that only works at the bar comes over saying \"is there a problem?\" Like wtf?!?! Why is this restaurant retarted. I'm never coming back here. The old lady tried to give so many excuses to why all of the employees suck and it was sad. Tried to argue with me. Dumbass, this place is trash, I'm sad my favorite place became the most disgusting and disrespectful place I've ever been to. Goodbye tomo. You will run out of business eventually."}
{"text":"I went the the other night for dinner.  Right off the bat I asked to sit at the sushi bar and they seated me way off to the side of the bar.  When I asked if I could sit in front of the sushi chefs so I could watch them as they made sushi the hostess explained to me that I couldn't because then the wait staff would constantly have to reach over me to get their plates to serve!  Isn't the reason to sit at the sushi bar so you can interact with the sushi chefs?  And the wait staff can't walk around the customers to pick up their plates.  Seemed odd so I opted for a table instead.

Then the sushi itself...we ordered spicy tuna rolls, pork goyza, vegetable tempura, and a specialty roll.  Not much of it was very good at all.  The spicy tuna rolls had so much rice!  I took enough rice off of each piece that I had enough left over for another role (not exaggerating here).  And it had a funny taste to it.  I think they may have added sesame oil to the mix.  The goes was either vegetable or had so little pork I couldn't find it.  And the specialty roll had a piece of shrimp tempura in it that was cold.  I asked the waiter if they made their shrimp tempura ahead of time and he confirmed they did.  I have never had a roll with shrimp tempura that had been sitting out before.  It should always be freshly prepared!  Although the vegetable tempura was a little greasy, it was the best thing we had.

I won't go back.  Still in search of good sushi here in the west valley."}
{"text":"Great food and value

Visited with employees to celebrate one's birthday. We all opted for bentos and it's amazing how much food you get for the money.  We all waddled away content... once we managed to pry ourselves from our chairs.

Tomo's has the usual variety of bento options-- all have some tempura and a ginger-dressing salad, some maki sushi, and meat options. Our group had the A, B, C, and E.  They offer one of the best bentos around and the sushi was surprisingly good.  I'm used to very hit-and-miss experiences with sushi in the Valley.  Truthfully, much more miss.

I also compelled the young men to sing Happy Birthday to our birthday boy. You could tell it wasn't their thing, but they didn't hesitate to give it a go.  It was a sad, off key rendition by all of us at the table.  Not a lick of harmony, but scored a 25% tip for earnest effort and fried ice cream with delicately placed candles!

Will be back to try, again."}
{"text":"So where can I begin with this joint! 
Me and my friend were here the lady pointed where our table was, at first didn't you know take us there lol then took forever to come and ask if we needed a drink, once she decided to come and asks she literally asked and right as we told her ran away so fast, we were both ready to order but weren't give the chance, after 20 minutes she comes back with drinks, we ordered food, we ordered an appetizer didn't come, then well ordered our food well the food got there sort of fast then the appetizer, which was not how we ordered it or wanted it. Anyway the roll that my friend ordered was a simple California roll she found a big piece of the plastic that they use to roll the sushi... man it was just bad 

TERRIBLE Service!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Tomo sushi! Very clean and very relaxing inside. I have been to this location an uncountable amount of times and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Love love love their green tea ice cream! Me and my friends crave it all the time. Also have very delicious sushi. The only downside is every time I've been there, I've had bad service."}
{"text":"So me and my girlfriend went there for lunch yesterday and they weren't even busy. It was my first time eating there and we were told it was a great place to eat sushi... Well we were mistaken. First off we were greeted by one server and she left to get our drinks then another server brings us our drinks back and she doesn't even introduce herself just asks if were ready to order with a slight attitude. She puts our order in and they bring out the first sushi dish which was a California Roll and based on the presentation it wasn't up to par what we normally saw when going to any sushi Japanese restaurant. It had no wasabi on the plate or ginger we had to ask for it. Some guy brought us the wasbai on the side and we asked more than once for the ginger and we never got it. Two different servers kept passing by us seeing we had one napkin each and when all the food came out they should've brought more napkins but they didnt. They only brought the rest of the food out and came back once and asked how was everything we didnt even answer. They never bothered to ask if we needed a refill on drinks or more napkins. They just assumed we were ok. As much as i love trying new places, this was very bad service and the fact it wasnt even busy yesterday afternoon. Spent almost $40. On terrible service. The food was great overall.  But i still think they should always include wasbai & ginger as a garnishing on each sushi plate. I don't think I'll go back unless i order takeout."}
{"text":"Food is always good.  Mondays are not a good service day however food ordered was fresh and fast.  Happy hour is amazing"}
{"text":"Worse experience EVER!! service is super slow soup was cold edamames was really under cooked and to put the cherry on the top when we were trying to show one of the workers our military id for a military discount the waitress tried taking his whole wallet until my husband loudly said to her \"Can you not touch my wallet\"  we will never be back"}
{"text":"I love fish, and I love them raw and wiggling and jumping around fresh.  Not literally though...  I been here like a bazillion times and every time it was an excellent experience.  In my opinion there is only one place that can top Tomo.  Just one.......

Sometimes the wait can be long depending on the time of the day and the day of the week you visit.  The food is always fresh and delicious and the price is decent for what you get (been here so many times I probably tried everything).  The restaurant was always clean and their restroom was clean as well.  Service has always been delightful and top notch.  

Great atmosphere, great place, definitely will come back to get my sushi fix."}
{"text":"The food is really good. It's hands down my favorite sushi place. Just don't come when it's busy because service is sub par. Our appetizers came with and after some of our sushi which happens about every other time we come. They're not very attentive so you usually have to ask for a sushi boat, drink refill, or your check. Tonight they were so overwhelmed they brought someone else's credit card to us. If the food wasn't so great we would not come here but it is so we suck up the poor service."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night with my wife and 3 year old.  We ordered our daughter a bowl of fried rice with beef.  It came in a huge bowl and was awesome!   My wife and I had several rolls including 2 signature rolls.  

Service was great.  If I were to go back, I'd just order the fried rice with beef and a few of the spicy California rolls. Ironically I preferred those rolls over the more expensive signature ones."}
{"text":"Four of us went for lunch today. I work in Goodyear but had not been in there for lunch but have been wanting to try it. My friend was off work and nearby so she called me and asked us to meet her for lunch here. 

We had the Arizona Rolls, Bento Box D, Chicken Teriyaki Bowl, Beef Yakitori and Pork Cutlet.

All were very good, everyone really liked what the got. The Bento Box is huge and could be split if you also got an appetizer or soup! 

The chicken teriyaki was really large as well, if you could double the chicken, you could split this as well. I think we will do that next time by ordering something small with it. 

Pork cutlet was also a very large portion with two hand sized flattened cutlets and several sides. It was on a platter, not a plate it was so big. 

Again, everyone liked it and for lunch, I liked the variety and price. In Goodyear can be hard to get a decent lunch that is not chain food. Food looked fresh and made to order, a nice touch in teh prefab world of food these days..."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi spot. We been here 7 years and counting. Atmosphere is good. Staff very friendly. Delicious food. The double double is my fave and their calamari is fresh with a good sauce. CeeCee is the best server. She's always on top of it. Good customer service. Tomo never disappoints."}
{"text":"We had a dinner there for my husband's birthday.  I had chirashi sushi, my husband had teriyaki chicken, my kids had tonkatsu and one of roll sushi.  Since I am a Japanese I have to say sushi rice need more venegar and I wanted to have kizami nori, kamaboko, denbu, shiitake,  tamagoyaki, more authentic. I like to try their lunch next time, I heard their bento lunch is very good.  I wish their miso soup has more tofu and wakame.  I can make better tonkatsu and teriyaki chicken, lol"}
{"text":"In good year, yelped sushi restaurants, tomo came up and had good reviews so I stopped by. Service was excellent. Food was good too! I had the ramen tonoktsu, gyoza and yellow tail sushi. I have no complaints. Glad I stopped by. Server was consistent and helpful. Would come again."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi roll I tried this go around was the Hawaiian Roll. It was delicious!! The other sushi rolls I tried were good as well. 

Sadly that's the only positive thing I can say about this place. Everything else was horrible. No one came to our table after they seated us to get our drinks. Finally after 15 min we had to flag a nearby waitress down. After getting our drinks we asked for more plates and utensils. We were halfway through eating by the time we were given the things we asked for. The service here almost ruins the good food in my opinion."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place bad but after giving it a chance a couple of times I'm afraid I'm not going back.. The food is decent I wouldn't say it's kabuki great. The bento E is delicious however they only serve it til 3pm even if you are willing to pay a little more for it, they refuse to serve it. The last and final time I came here we had sat down and ordered are food and we had waited close to 40 minutes and had about five different waiters and one of them came to charge us for food we had yet not eaten, the plate I HAD to order due to the (lame 3pm lunch rule) had 3 scallops and 6shrimps with a TON of coleslaw the scallops had a funky taste to it. The service all times we had visited is horrible you wait a long time while you see the waiters mostly talking and texting around. Aweful aweful I don't recommend this place and I only gave it two stars for the only plate I liked that stops serving at 3pm. And that it's a local family restaurant."}
{"text":"Went in there tonight to grab some sushi and seaweed salad. I've been to Tomo before but it had been years and now I know why I stayed away. The seaweed salad was a tiny bit of seaweed on top of a pile of lettuce. I've never had it served this way at any other restaurant. Usually when you get seaweed salad, it's pretty much all seaweed. The calamari was so heavy with batter that you couldn't taste the squid at all. It was like eating a tempura hushpuppy with a little squid in the middle. 

After the appetizers, we waited a very long time before our server came back to actually take our order. By the time she returned, we debated just leaving but we put in an order for a caterpillar roll anyway. 

It was also pretty bland and so heavy with panko or whatever they fried it in, that it was pretty much tasteless. 

I'm used to waiting when going to a restaurant on a Friday night since every place is packed but our server literally hit up all of her tables repeatedly except ours. She would circumnavigate the restaurant almost like she was avoiding passing by our table. It must have been noticed since several others servers came by to check on us and we even had to request our bill from one of them. 

I love eating out and I'm a pretty heavy tipper because my mom was a waitress for most of her life but this kind of service was just ridiculous. I will not be going back here."}
{"text":"This place is legit. I am used to going to all the high-end sushi places in scottsdale and this place is right there. The restaurant is really nice and the service is amazing and the sushi is really good."}
{"text":"Food is really good! I recommend the teriyaki chicken.
Service is okay. It takes the servers quite awhile before they finally give whatever you requested. However it might be because it's lunch time, and the place is quite busy, so its not at all bad. Overall the food is good, and i recommend you guys to try this place out."}
{"text":"Great happy hour selections. Sushi is always fresh and tasty. Monkey balls wasn't that great, hardly to no filling in the mushrooms."}
{"text":"Unbelievable hidden gem of a sushi bar tucked in a strip mall at the SW corner of Dysart and McDowell.  We absolutely love this place and think it is quite possibly one of the best sushi options in the entire Valley.
We've introduced several friends to it, and all of them are shocked that a restaurant this good is in the West Valley.
Their sashimi is always top notch, their drink specials great, and their selection of rolls are too many to mention.  We especially love the ninja jalapeno appetizer and the Double Double and Cactus rolls."}
{"text":"I lived in Seattle for 5 years before moving here, and was spoiled with delicious cheap sushi. I thought for sure I would never find good sushi in the desert until I found Tomo!

I've been here at least 25 times, and have never been disappointed. Without fail every time we get the miso soup, spider roll and always a sushimi boat.

Thank you Tomo for showing me that we could find good sushi in the desert!"}
{"text":"This spot was the go to spot for sushi. I even had my friends come over for my birthday to enjoy the food. My hubby and I have been coming here for a while and we always know that the sushi is going to be great but we give ourselves a little extra time knowing that the wait staff and service is definitely lacking. I'm rating this a one tonight because everytime we go we give the servers the benefit of the doubt because they're young/inexperienced. We were seated at our table then after about 10 minutes I had to ask who our waitress was. The waitress said that she would get our assigned waitress. Our waitress walked up w unkept  long hair and was wearing it down. Then she took our order. My hubby got his food 34 minutes later. During this whole time all the other waitresses were walking around and people that showed up later got their meal first. Well, let's just say I'm sitting at home hungry and starving because an hour later our sushi never showed. On a good note, we didn't have to pay for my hubby's 6$ soup."}
{"text":"Consistent and great food. This is our favorite spot for great sushi rolls and they have a really good happy hour. Be warned though it is always jam packed during happy hour. The happy hour draft beer is only $2! Can't beat that.  The service is always great too!"}
{"text":"Hurray for Tomo!!!  I'm so glad that we found this place, as I live out west and was getting really sick of driving out to Scottsdale for decent sushi.  I absolutely love the ambiance of the place (on the inside, the outside is a nondescript strip mall, go figure), and the service is almost always top notch.  We've become regulars at the place, and our favorite waitress remembers our basic order, including that I can't have avocado in one of the rolls I order.  That, my friends, is a sign of a great server.

We usually go during Happy Hour, which is incredible.  The rolls are very nicely priced during this time (3-6pm every day), and any other time of the day they are priced how you would expect a sushi place to price their rolls.  I love their spicy tuna tartare, and I would also recommend their crazy roll.  If you go during non-happy hour, try the unagi.  It's great too (and decently priced).  Also, it's important to note that the size of the rolls is awesome - no skimping, and the perfect ratio of fish to rice.

If you're looking for a great sushi joint in the west valley, head on over to Tomo!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! First time here needed a little time to look threw the menu so I ordered an appetizer and a sake bomb both came out quickly but when I wasn't ready to order when my beer came out. I never saw my waitress again. 25 min later appetizer gone beer gone had to ask waitress for the table next to me for my check and she cashed me out."}
{"text":"I had the bento D which was sashimi, chef's choice of 5 generous slices, salad, spicy tuna rolls, bbq beef, gyoza, and miso soup. It was delicious!! I also had the calamari appetizers but that was a ok. Being the third time being there I would highly suggest for others to try. My table's service was good as well but I've noticed our waiter started to forget certain requests such as water refills when the restaurant became a little packed for lunch. Other than that I've enjoyed my meals here!!!"}
{"text":"Most definitely my favorite west side Sushi spot! 

The sushi is always fresh and tasty! The prices during happy hour are excellent! 

The ambiance is chic and trendy. 
Just love love Tomo's!!!"}
{"text":"Really yummy sushi!!!  We had the spider, rockstar, Goodyear, hot crunch, dysart and the Las Vegas roll. And each one was really good! Only issue was that the waitress didn't come around that often.  Other then the waitress being M.I.A I highly recommend this place for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"I am so glad that we came back to Tomo. I absolutely loved what we had today. The Popcorn Lobster Roll was awesome and is definitely a new favorite. The Spicy Ninja Roll was really good too. It was almost like jalapeño popper sushi, but it worked. The thing I didn't like as much were the monkey balls. Mushrooms stuffed and fried. I have read a lot of reviews where people raved about them but we thought they were just ok. I probably wouldn't order them again myself but obviously from the other reviews people love them. If you have people that don't love sushi they have a lot of other things to choose from. The one downside- I ordered a margarita that was served in a tall glass and tasted like almost pure margarita mix. Guess I will stick to sake next time :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service and very fresh sashimi! Awesome happy hour prices and great ambiance!"}
{"text":"Different...

Maybe because I'm new to AZ I find it weird when you sit at the sushi bar and get completely ignored by the sushi chefs.. because in any sushi bar that is of quality the prized seats are the bar.

 I observe the fish and they are run of the mill (I'm a prior sushi chef) and recognize nothing to write home about... nigiri isn't offered and there is a reason.. generally when you sit at a bar seat, you are offered ginger and wasabi by the chef, and a cordial conversation on ordering is normal..none of that occured here.. -2 stars

Move to the table experience changes..Waitress takes our order and drinks... they have some  decent sake, and they look to have a full bar in the back. 2 star... 

sushi and appetizers are decent and in tune for california style sushi, unique sauces to complement rolls,1 star...

Service at table is where to be in this establishment and I have learned this now.. had maybe I forgotten about the sushi bar experience it would have been better. I'm tough on sushi, and this place makes 3 stars.."}
{"text":"This Japanese restaurant was amazing! The food was delicious. I went to tomo a few times already and every time it just keeps getting better and better. I always order the BBQ spare ribs and the Bento Box meals at lunch time. Great food for a great price! The service is always welcoming, will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Japanese restaurants in the valley.

Best bento box combo....lunch only.  Dinner is a bit pricey.  You won't be disappointed if you go there for lunch.  The presentation is flawless.  Good quality ingredients.

Korean sushi chefs.

Dinner Menu SUCKS!!!  No BENTO boxes."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is good. BUT too much rice on their rolls!!!! I have to take off half of the rice!"}
{"text":"Love the food here!! Love the atmosphere! BUT The service is atrocious and incompetent at best! Would have given this place 5 stars if the service was better...or at least decent."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for a romantic sushi dinner! The atmosphere & ambiance of this place is great, the decor is beautiful. The sushi is fresh & delicious, I am only giving 4 stars though because the service is slow,"}
{"text":"Awesome food horrible costumer service. If you want to spend 10years here waiting for sushi this is def. Your place!"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Tomos in celebration of my brother and my girlfriend's birthday.  Since then, it has become my favorite sushi joint in the west valley!

Tomos keeps their restaurant dimly lit and there's plenty of bar space [sushi and alcohol] available.  I've only been here for dinner so I have yet experienced their lunch or Happy Hour special but I can't imagine those being anything less than delicious.  

For appetizers, their monkey balls, soft shell crab, the ninja jalapenos, and oyster shooters are delicious [warning:  raw quail egg].  Some of my favorite rolls are the Passion of Fire [pity they don't bring this lit on fire anymore], the Dysart Roll, Crunch Roll, Cowboy Roll, Dragon Roll, Spider Roll, and Popcorn Lobster.  The sashimi is always thickly cut and Ocean Salad is great too.

Tomos is the best sushi you can get in the west valley!"}
{"text":"Actually ended up here by mistake, what a great accident!!  Great food, staff and atmosphere!  Not a lot of experience with Japanese food but our waitress and waiter were patient and the food was really good!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites.

I'm a sushi snob (living in the far east for 3 years will do that), so it's difficult for me to find sushi I enjoy. In the west valley, however, I don't think you'll find a better place. Calm and relaxed atmosphere, decent pricing, good drinks, good service...not a bad pace to hang out for happy hour or just for a Sunday dinner with the family."}
{"text":"Good selection of sushi for a place in AZ. I'm from CA and I was a bit skeptical. The beers were like $2 as well. Quite a few of the rolls came slathered in spicy mayo which I like so I was pleased! Trendy decor and friendly albeit it slightly inattentive staff."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went here for the first time this afternoon. We were actually planning on going to Nakama, on the other side of the street, for their happy hour all day on sunday. But when we got there I couldn't remember which place I'd chosen. So we decided on Tomo, which turned out to be a very good thing. We've had trouble finding really good sushi on this side of the valley, but we've found our new favorite place now!

First off, the decor is great! They have 3 TVs with sports playing and one that goes through all their special rolls and drinks. They have booths, larger tables, a sushi bar and an actual bar. There's plenty of space for larger parties, which I've found a lot of sushi places lack. The menu also had pictures of almost all their food (and there's a lot). We were very impressed. 

Everyone there was super nice, they all said hello when we walked in and goodbye when we left. The waitresses were very attentive, always kept our drinks refilled and gave us free miso soup!

Despite having read that they had big portions sizes, we decided to get 2 chicken bowls and a roll each, since we were starving. The chicken bowls were huge, delicious and only $6! We had a Nemo roll (cali roll with white fish and salmon on top) Jeff loved it, he's super picky about his sushi and he ate all of it. I got a Golden Cali roll (deep fried cali roll with eel and eel sauce on top) I loved it as well. They were both 9 pieces, they didn't skimp on anything and were twice the size of a lot of rolls I've had in the past.

They have 10% off your bill Sun.-Thurs, with the exception of happy hour which is from 3-6. We went around 2 for lunch, the bill wasn't bad at all. If you're anywhere in the area you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"Food was great! We were sitting in the back and the waitress forgot about us for a while but as soon as she remembered the service was good. Very relaxed place to eat! Not very expensive and great food! I'd recommend it to anyone who like sushi!"}
{"text":"I was first met by a warm welcome greeting both times I visited.  This is a sort of place that leaves you utterly satisfied and happy after done eating.  

This restaurant is very suitable for any kinds of occasions to include family outings and dates.  A small bar on the side definitely kicks it up a notch for some of the folks who need a litte extra.  

It is definitely hard to find a place like this in the area.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Rolls were delicious and well presented. They didn't include wasabi and ginger with out plates so we asked the waitress to bring us some. After a while we felt like she forgot about us and had to ask another waitress for it, to which she was more prompt about( our original waitress came back and apologized).

At the end of the night we had a different waitress taking our plates and checking us out.

Out of three waitresses there were MAYBE 7 tables occupied. Not entirely sure why our original waitress couldn't tend to us.

OTHER THAN THAT I still really enjoyed the Oyshi Roll. Super refreshing and flavorful."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place for Happy Hour. Sushi is always yummy, service is always fast and the prices are amazing during happy hour."}
{"text":"Love the Asian bartender, fun personality. Makes it an extra special happy hour. Best baked sushi I have tried. They have several options, baked is my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is tucked behind the busy streets of Dysart and McDowell.
The environment is slightly dark but very comfortable, ambient music is very soothing and if you are a sports fan they offer a few HDTV at the main dining area as well as some more at the bar. 

The sushi price is a tad high if you order exotic items, which is why i only come during happy hours:
Their happy hour is awesome, an array of appetizers/drinks/rolls for 50% of the regular menu price. 

I highly recommend Crazy roll, i normally get some spicy tuna roll with it

The servers are always helpful and nice, it's a great place to have sushi!"}
{"text":"The food is quite good but the service is pretty slow. We ate there two days in a row, I guess because we needed to be sure that the food was as good as it was and it was. The sushi was all good, the somen was also good, but the curry cutlet was in need of help. The pork was cut too thin and the batter would not adhere properly to the pork. The shrimp shumai was so tiny that it should not be on the menu. The beef stick was very tough, but the sesame chicken was very good, but only if you like it on the sweet side. We ordered several sushi rolls and we had to ask for wasabi and ginger, something automatically done in L.A. Japanese restaurants. All in all I would go there again if I am in town."}
{"text":"The first time we went here we didn't like one roll we ordered, it just wasn't our style and no one's fault, but the manager noticed and gave us a gift card for a free roll for our next visit.  
Our second visit my husband got a business call at the end of our meal, and I was loading out kids into the truck.  He left behind his credit card.  The manager chased us down in the parking lot to return it to us! 

Service is great, and all the rolls have usually been great other than the oddball one, atmosphere is relaxed and inviting.  We really enjoy this place and highly recommend!"}
