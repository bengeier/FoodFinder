{"text":"This venue is the real deal. Order the falafel plate; only then do they press the falafels into shape, deep fry them, and add them to a generous box of individually tasty sides. The owner looks like he came from a rough rough area (war-torn Syria perhaps?), but he creates beauty and love with his food. I was reluctant to try this restaurant because it was brand new, and now that I've tried it I regret not discovering this gem on opening day."}
{"text":"Introduced to Shish by way of Uber Eats. The food is so clean and leaves you satisfied. Another bonus is that they definitely don't skimp on portions. We've ordered the Family Pack for $35 and it easily fed 6 adults with enough left overs for another meal the next day. When we're in the mood for Mediterranean this is our go to. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"it's good overall, the chicken is just  touch in the dry side. The customer service is non existent sadly ."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this shawarma, lots of toppings, reasonable price, no complaints at all"}
{"text":"Found one of their beard hair in my food that I think was done purposely. I would never look back at that place again. There's plenty of other competition!!"}
{"text":"Probably my favourite local shawarma joint. Reasonable prices. Good falafels. Fantastic BBQ chicken. Good daily specials. Friendly service. Their beef shawarma needs work."}
{"text":"delicious food, good portions, nice people!"}
{"text":"Great food for a great value. Daily specials are worth the trip. Large servings of flavourful food, friendly staff"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Ordered the platter, the kofta meat was greasy, tastless and grisly. The chicken legs were a pathetic dry disaster. I ordered falafel but they didn't include any. To boot, when I made this order over the phone, the first time they hung up on me. Should have taken that as a sign. When I called back, the guy didn't even ask me my name, I had to slow him down and tell him who'd be picking it up. Never again."}
{"text":"I love the chicken shawarma. Thank gif it's so close to my house! Get Extra hot sauce"}
{"text":"Great place and not cause it's one of the only middle eastern restaurants in the area. The portion sizes are good and the tastes great, their falafel is good and the chicken special during the week is sooo good. I would highly suggest it"}
