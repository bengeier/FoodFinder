{"text":"I ordered catering trays for a bridal shower I was having, I was extremely impressed with how easy it was order on line, how nice and friendly the people working there and the wraps and salad I ordered were a hit at the party, will Order from them again"}
{"text":"Had the steak fajita, but the group I was with loved their choices. Nice and tightly wrapped, crisp and a great spread of flavour. Menu is organised by meat type and the specials change daily.

 If you want a good quick bite you can't go wrong, the drinks were a little on the pricey side since you can't really get a refill if you leave but you do get to pour your own. 

On a side note the cookie tastes home made and were DELISH. win."}
{"text":"The place reeked of moldy towels when I went in, If I had not pre-arranged to meet a friend there,I would have walked right back out!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food. I had the hot honey sandwich and loaded potato soup.  It was delicious! Since I had the the food delivered it was a 15 dollar min. I got the wild berry smoothie. It was a little bit too sweet for my taste, I just added water to it and it was just fine. The delivery was fast like hang up the phone and there was a knock on my door fast! I will order from there again it was great."}
{"text":"Service is always very good and the food is freshly prepared.  Only complaint is that it's not the most bang for your buck in the \"fill-you-up\" department."}
{"text":"I got the chicken popper grilled sandwich and it was excellent!!  Restaurant was clean. Staff friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"I love the food at Roly Poly.  The sandwiches are made fresh upon ordering.  Great way to get in your veges!! Delivery is fast.  I downloaded their app recently and have ordered from them twice already!  Payments are either called in or you can pay cash upon delivery.  Food is a bit more affordable than Paneras, and I love that they deliver."}
{"text":"The service is always fast and friendly, whether you are eating in, taking out, or getting delivery. Quality is always great. They even throw in cookies for our kids once in a while. Great little \"wrap\" shop run by great people."}
{"text":"My absolute FAV take out place in the area. I have yet to order anything here that wasn't delicious. AND THEY DELIVER, what could be better??
Their menu is impressively large, you'd have to be a crazy person to not find anything you like (they even have GF tortillas). My personal favorite is the Basil Cashew Chicken...yummmmm. I'd like to try them all! Will take some time!"}
{"text":"Placed an online order for delivery... it never showed up and no one answered the phone or emails.  Received a confirmation but nothing else.   Be aware!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.  Got an awesome dill tuna salad.  My husband said his dill tuna wrap was best tuna sandwich he ever had.  Highly recommend the mushroom bisque, very tasty.  And glad we got talked into the (baked in store) cookies!  :). And it was delivered in less than 20 minutes to our hotel room!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The people who work here are super nice.The food is good and doesn't take long at all for your order to be ready. The bathroom and eating area are both very clean. We go here all the time. We haven't tried the delivery out yet. Definitely recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"Meh, it's okay.  I ordered the Cuban wrap and it sounded more delicious than it actually was so I attribute it to mediocre ingredients.  If you want a 6\" wrap make sure you specify...otherwise they will ring you up for a 12\".  I think that is kind of a bogus assumption and the girl did not ask what size we wanted.  The side of honey mustard was really good.  Big menu."}
{"text":"Roly Poly offers a variety of wraps, soups, and salads.  And if they don't offer the type of wrap you want, you can \"roll your own,\" meaning you can pick whatever ingredients you want to create your own sandwich masterpiece.  The selections definitely seem healthier and look fresher than traditional fast food sandwiches (which is a good thing), but the prices for the wraps (to me) aren't that great for what you get, even with a combo.

Roly Poly reminds me a little bit of a food court Mediterranean place called Hovan that I used to frequent in Orlando.  Unfortunately, Roly Poly doesn't have the Mediterranean side dishes of hummus and tabbouleh that Hovan did.  

Overall, though, I can recommend Roly Poly for a quick, light lunch, especially if you're into food experimentation.  There are many combinations from which you can choose, be you a carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore.  Just don't expect it to come cheap -- think Quizno's, not Subway!"}
{"text":"Great place. Lots of selections from the heat pressed rolls to all of their great salads. 
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich rolls. We ordered california hummer & philly melt and we loved them all.. highly recommend this place for sandwich lovers. Also their froyo was awesome! Great customer service with friendly staff.."}
{"text":"Food is great , that's no question. I brought my sippy cup with me and forgot to tell them to charge me for A drink and before I could even fill up my cup I was accused of stealing pop ... Yeah the manager called me a thief and didn't even give me a chance to have them charge me for a drink. It was easier to fill up my cup then walk back up to the counter. The manager Mike Goda was completely unprofessional and is rude. I would recommend spending your money at this business. This was a terrible experience."}
{"text":"This place is so small, you might miss it. Which would be a shame. Delightfully fresh and tasty wraps, some grilled, yummy cookies on the side and an inviting staff.
Clean, nice big TV's, a great variety of wraps to fit every taste, vegetarians and meat eaters alike."}
{"text":"Tried poly roly when taking my driving license test.. very nice place to have a quick meal."}
{"text":"Always friendly. Quick delivery. Tasty food! Soup is a bit salty but everything else is great!"}
{"text":"The nut and honey option is one of my favorites. This place is full of vegetarian goodness with like 10 different veggie-delicious possibilities on the menu. It's a little out of the way for me, but I head over there about once a week for lunch. 

In addition to all the options, there's just something kind of fun about a rolled sandwich. It makes it taste a little better, too, I think, in that the roll spreads the flavors around more efficiently than a traditional sandwich...not to mention that it cuts back on some of the carbs."}
{"text":"Roly Poly is a hidden gem tucked in the middle of a strip of stores in Golden Gate Plaza. There are three things that are great about RP: (1) the service; (2) the food; and (3) the smoothies - mango is ridiculous! Everything is so fresh, and healthy but satisfying. 

There's not a whole lot of seating, but the place doesn't seem to get packed so you can definitely eat in. If you haven't already, check this place out while you're out there shopping."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Like the best. When they get the order right. But the guy who works there is a total dick. Sorry I interrupted the Ohio State game by being a customer...."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but past couple of times I went I got my same wrap which is the chicken salad with light tai however they barely put any chicken salad on the wrap! When I got home and opened it you may as well say I had a wrap with nothing in it! Very disappointing and I let them know it had changed and I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Still delicious and fresh! And now serving tart yogurt, a la yogurt chains out west. A must visit if you're into tart yogurt!"}
{"text":"JI love this place. It can be a bit overwhelming but the staff is so helpful, I think she may be the manager because she is there all the time. She made it very easy, and fun. The prices are reasonable, if you got a value meal at McDonald's it would be close to the same price, but minus the stomach upset, indigestion.
The sandwiches are fresh and full of quality veggies. I love the yo, its their frozen yogurt. It's not to sweet and is very refreshing. 

Kids would also love this place.  It has something for everyone."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service...they remember you and appreciate your business each time.

The menu is so vast, you won't have to worry about what you're in the mood for because there will be multiple items that peak your tastebuds!! Even many vegetarian options, if that's what you're into.

The Turkey Applejack is my favorite with Hot Honey and Chipotle Cheesesteak coming in close behind. I've had many others and you really can't go wrong with any of the choices. Fresh tasting ingredients and consistancy in preparation should have you coming back over and over again.

Catering trays are also available and yummy!"}
{"text":"CLOSED.  This was a great restaurant with many vegetarian options and the shop owner was always friendly.  I went by there on 3/28/2011 and sadly, this place has now closed.  It's odd because it always seemed busy."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give RP a 3 star review based on the wife's wrap but mine tasted too good to do so.  She went with the Thanksgiving Turkey wrap which was loaded with more lettuce then needed and tons of onions.  I think they were trying too hard to add content to this wrap where they should have just put more turkey in.  My wrap on the other hand was the Chicken Cordon Bleu.  It was fantastic.  Next time I will get it without tomato because it really made a drippy mess.

I do see a common theme with RP.  They add very similar toppings for most of their wraps and I think it really has to do with making them appear 'worth your money'.  I will say that for $13 and getting only 1 small / 1 large with pop and chips was a little expensive.  Absolutely no reason this should have cost so much.  Compare with $5 foot longs at Subway or $4 foot longs at What about Bob's in Willoughby.  This is only my opinion."}
{"text":"The new owners drove this place into the ground. It's really a shame. It used to be spotless with great food and service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for another bite this evening before class.  This time, I tried the Cubano wrap.  It was really tasty and you gotta love how they press the wraps in that toaster/heater thingy that makes fake grill marks.  Anyway, the one thing I didn't like was the romaine lettuce that was placed inside of my wrap and then heated to about 100 degrees fahrenheit.  Steamed, wilted lettuce does not tear easily.  I pulled it out and set it aside.  Gross.  Otherwise, the sandwich was really tasty.  I also had a side of potato salad, which was also tasty.  Washed it down with a lemonade and ran back out into the cold rain.  Joy."}
{"text":"Great Service and the food is very fresh and cooked to order.  The Chicken Caesar salad is the bomb."}
{"text":"This is a great Roly Poly Franchise.  I have only been to two, but both were very friendly and genuinely made an effort to please the customer.  

The woman who takes your order is very friendly, always remembers you when you come back, and usually complements you.  Who doesn't love a mid-day complement? 

The place is very clean, and has enough tables for their lunch crowd.  Location is hard to find, with a very small sign in a strip mall, however it is very worth the search.  

They also offer fro-yo and smoothies which I have yet to try. 

I'm so satisfied with this food I usually buy a wrap to go.  (I order the #31, Delhi Chicken, there's nothing like this curried chicken salad, bacon, sprouts, avocado and pineapple wrap-DELICIOUS and refreshing)."}
{"text":"Got sante fe chicken and it was delicious. It's a grilled sandwich and came out piping hot."}
{"text":"Poor service, food was terrible and the employees and manager are just plain rude. Plenty of other places to eat In the area- avoid this place. Waste of time and money. STOP, NO and DON'T!!"}
{"text":"I just picked up an order from this location & was extremely excited to try a new lunch spot. Needless to say I will not be dining here ever again. I was almost there to pick up my order & received a phone call to tell me they only had enough broccoli & cheddar soup for a cup not a bowl. (I had one order of the cup & one bowl) I took this as my co-worker was just going to be getting a cup now instead of a bowl. I notice on my drive back that there was only one cup inside the bag. (Thank God Panera was on my drive back). 

Willing to overlook the miscommunication I opened up my chicken chipotle wrap a monsoon of what appeared to might of been the chipotle ranch? came tumbling onto my lap, I couldn't pick the wrap up it was so soggy & all the condiments inside were soggy, it honestly was one of the worst things I've indulged in. Furious, I am now starving for the last 4 hours of my day & out of $12. I truly hope someone tries to make this right , I see potential in this establishment. Running out of soup at 1:00pm & selling non edible food isn't a great start to success."}
{"text":"Always quick and friendly service. I usually get a chicken wrap, but don't have one favorite. Beware that they can get a bit drippy (especially the chicken fajita with fajita sauce). 

Love that they have a kids option. My little one can get her own roll up (we usually opt for turkey or chicken with cheese), along with chips or a cookie and a juice box. 

My mom is a fan of their Spa salad, which is loaded with fresh veggies, avocado, cranberries, walnuts, chicken and more. It's yummy and filling."}
{"text":"I love this place and I love the service! When you order your food it comes out fast and always correct! They even walk your food out to you when you're waiting."}
