{"text":"First, The food here is very good.  Where I work we order from Lava Grill 2-3 times a week.  But, Went in on Saturday with the family, Finally talked the wife into going in.  We placed our orders (They were out of the BBQ Pork.  Bummer).  When we got the orders the portions were smaller then we normally get at work.  I was sitting in the front while eating and observed that the family behind got the portion size I was used too getting when ordering from work.  The Cashier/Cook (Tall Bald Guy) was kind of squirrely/hesitant/standoffish the whole time we were there.  The eating area could have used a little cleaning but I have seen worse.  Just didn't have a comfortable experience while there.  Wife and kids had to stop someplace else to grab some more food due to the small portions Lava Grill provided.  Highly unlikely I'll be able to get the family to go back there again."}
{"text":"Ordered to pick up. The ribs were excellent. Guy very friendly. Will come here often. Thanks."}
{"text":"Best grilled teriyaki chicken, beef, salmon, pork, and short ribs in town and the prices are amazing. There's not enough praises I can say to this establishment. Very friendly staff. I highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Get the chicken with veggies with extra meat. It will blow you away. The owner is really cool"}
{"text":"Yesterday I called in an order of white meat chicken, brown rice and vegetables for lunch.  The man who answered the phone responded \"We'll get to it when we can,\" which didn't really give me a hint of when I should leave to pick it up.  I had the address but didn't know exactly where it was located although I had an idea.  I asked if they were in the same shopping center where Gold's used to be.  He said \"the address is on the menu.\"  He couldn't tell me they were in the same complex as Subway or Enterprise which was weird.  I found it and waited about 5 min. to get the order. As others have said, it's very small inside, not a lot of tables but just about every table had a person waiting for a pick-up order.  It was very smoky inside from the grill, they had a fan blowing full blast next to where I was sitting, I wouldn't have wanted to eat there.  I think they need better ventilation.  When I got back to my office to eat, I really couldn't tell if the chicken was white meat but the flavor was pretty good.  The rice was chewy and I didn't care for the vegetables which were barely cooked and the pieces of cabbage(?) were too large.  For the price ($4.39) it's not bad if you are craving a teriyaki bowl but don't want to spend much more at Panda."}
{"text":"Good place to get a healthy meal and it tastes great too. The Steak was my favorite meat, with Brown Rice and Veggies. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and healthy!  Yes, both can be in the same sentence.  Beef lava bowl with brown rice and veggies, BBQ Pork with brown rice and veggies, Salmon with just veggies and Beef lava bowl (double meat for $1.99 extra) with just veggies.  Everyone was full when we were done and could not stop raving about the food.  We all got an extra serving of \"lava sauce\" to put on our meals and it was perfect! 

As seems to happen every time, when the rush dies down Mike and the crew come out and ask about the experience and make sure everything was OK.

Make sure you are really hungry if you order an entree with the double meat.  It looked as though along with easily double meat, there were double veggies as well and it was a struggle for my friend to finish.  Fortunately life is all about struggles and he persevered!"}
{"text":"Really good healthy food!  I like the ribs and beef!  I'll definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food!!! We could eat there everyday !!! With those prices it's tempting not to go there every single day ! I love their chicken box.. The lava sauce is delicious and the rice is super yum"}
{"text":"This is my first time writing a review but I decided to write one for this restaurant. Great prices and very healthy, I would honestly recommend this place. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Move over Mr Madness!!! This place just kicked it up to a much higher standard. The chicken: tender pieces, no chewy or fatty pieces, extremely flavorful, grilled to perfection. Veggies: carrots, broccoli, cabbage all perfectly steamed, bright colors, tender to the bite but with enough of a crunch to hold on to all the nutrients and vitamins. Rice: the perfect bed for the last two delicious sides. Great fast service,  clean facilities, and even if you ate here all week, you would still have enogh money for your groceries.  Definately a great and healthy option for those days I just don't have time to cook!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by accident. I think this part of my life was supposed to happen! Lol. This place is beyond delicious! Better than teryaki madness and panda express! Really puts them to shame on quality and price. I had the chicken, rice and veggie box... All I can say is wow! This place has it down! I am hooked and will be back for more... Thanks lava grill!"}
{"text":"The food here is surprisingly good and flavorful. The best part is that it is highly affordable. I paid about $5 for a full meal. It does take a while for them to cook it, so be sure to call ahead to place your order."}
{"text":"I like the pork and veggies with rice. It's tasty, quick and reasonably priced. Definitely ask for extra lava sauce."}
{"text":"The Lava Grill offers fresh meat and vegetables over rice for a moderate price. I found it tasty and worth our brief wait."}
{"text":"Great healthy food. Good prices too. Sometimes your wait is long so call ahead."}
{"text":"Just a couple of bites and I am very pleased. My usual lunch is chicken and vegetables, and this is an amazing substitute! The price is more than great for the food you get and its quick to pick up. 

Only qualm is that I now am back and work and smell like a barbecue. It's a pretty small place so the kitchen smoke wafts out into the restaurant."}
{"text":"still the best! MUST TRY! if you are in a rush call them ahead. always prompt and delicious! it isn't teriyaki sauce, it's lava sauce. my go to lunch spot"}
{"text":"Nothing special and a little bit of food. It wasn't worth the money. The short ribs are pretty much like the kind that you get at the typical Hawaiian places. The rice was was very dry and gritty. The guy at the front, maybe the owner, was not friendly when you walked in and looked angry. I almost walked out because of that."}
{"text":"Great food on the budget!  Not only that, their food is healthy too.  Grilled meats, mixed veggies, on top of brown rice ftw!"}
{"text":"I'm from Cali and there is no flame broiler or waba grill here. This place is very similar but it definitely tops both places! The food is fantastic! I love it and it's super affordable!"}
{"text":"Food tastes good, i had the chicken box, which is grilled chicken with white rice and steamed vegetables. 

This is a great spot to stop grab a great meal and go about your day. I'll definitely be back and recommend this business.

Good place for a quick meal, nothing fancy but adequate."}
{"text":"Well I had driven by it many times, finally stopped in. It is a short menu. Basically it is the meat of your choice cooked over lava rocks, and served with rice or noodles, and veggies. The veggies are cabbage, broccoli and carrot slices. I had the chicken, done GREAT. A friend had same as me, and another friend had the pork with noodles and veggies. You can get extra meat for $2 more but it is really not necessary. I tried my buddy's pork and it was good but the chicken was REALLY good. All three of us got a bottled water ($1 each). The two of us that got chicken ordered the extra meat helping as we didn't know better. Too much food and for all three dinners after tax was $23 and change. A side note, you order at the counter then sit, and then pick it up at the counter. It all comes in a Styrofoam container whether eating in or not. So self serve somewhat, but for the cost savings, worth it."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Quick service. Good was great and was a very reasonable price.   They have Hawaiian sun drinks. Great tasting food. Very nice spot for a nice lil lunch. Chicken, brown rice, veggie bowl for $3.99"}
{"text":"Not to be confused with the 2005 movie Shark Boy and Lava Girl, Lava Grill is a handy, healthy option when you're too lazy to meal prep but want to hit your macros and/or eat clean on a budget. Menu selections are beef, chicken, or salmon, on your choice of white or brown rice, with or without vegetables. The meats are actually cooked on lava rocks for a nice char, and it smells great in here.

But on my first visit, they were out of salmon and on my second they were out of brown rice, which was disappointing considering their menu is already pretty limited. They offer \"lava sauce\" and bottles of Sriracha to add flavor to your food. Everything's fresh and made to order, d√©cor is a little sparse. Wish they had additional sauce options as my food was kind of plain, with just a small drizzle of (teriyaki?) sauce with the meat. Meal prices range from $4-7, very affordable."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Always made fresh! I order take out twice a week from here... My order is always ready at the appointed time given... The best part about the delicious food cooked over  lava rocks is it's not riddled with poisonous ingredients like High Fructose corn syrup and ammonia hydroxide.."}
{"text":"Cheap, tasty meal! Very happy I tried this place. I ordered grilled chicken with brown rice and veggies. Total bill was under $5.00! Definitely worth a visit and I may have found my go-to lunch place! :)"}
{"text":"Got there right when it opened and glad we did.  The orders from people and through the phone just kept coming in.  We all got something different, and everything was pretty good.  Had that charcoal taste without overdoing it.  Server said it was from lava rocks they used to cook the meat, not sure if it's true, but the taste was there.  All in all, pretty good.  Would I go back?  If I happen to be in the area, definitely."}
{"text":"I am a regular at Lava grill, Ribs and pork are my favorite! I have been going there since they opened ! great food and its affordable!!! They have great customer service !"}
{"text":"Much better alternative than all the fast food joints with very reasonable prices.  On several occasions I've ordered the chicken and veggies with white rice (yes, I've gotta expand my selection).  The portion is perfect, the chicken is tender, and the lava sauce is light and flavorful.  The veggies tend to be a bit soggy, otherwise would be a 4 star rating.

The place is small and casual (which I like) with three rows of parking (one in front of the store, one in the middle, and one facing Flamingo).  I've never had an issue parking.  Orders only take about 10 minutes during lunch - pretty quick for cooking to order.

Overall, great prices, tender chicken, and healthy alternative.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I needed a quick inexpensive lunch and I was in the neighborhood. Based on the Yelp reviews, I chose Lava Grill.
Ambiance: This is a small storefront restaurant in a non-descript strip mall. Easy to drive by unless you know it is there. The restaurant itself is very small. Maybe 10 feet from the front door to the counter where you place your order, maybe 15 feet wide. About 8 tables for 2, no decorating. Everything was clean. Clearly, the design is for take-out, not for dining in. After I sat down, four other orders came in. The resulting cooking caused the room to become fairly smokey.
Service: You place your order at the counter. You pick it up when the food is ready - so no service to speak of. The food is ready in about 10 minutes.
Food: I ordered the chicken and beef box with rice and cabbage ($2 extra for the extra meat). My wife got double chicken and veggies. The food was OK, not great but fit the bill for an acceptable fast, inexpensive meal. After I added extra Lava sauce (you have to ask for it. A very small container with about a tablespoon of something that looked like soy sauce). that improved the taste greatly.
Value: I really wanted to like this place. It struck me as a Ma and Pa operation, and they were trying really hard. Portion size was fairly generous. Lunch for 2 with double meat was about $16. Some of the options were as inexpensive as $4. I think the most expensive was about $8. It was OK for what I was looking for but I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Came here due to glowing reviews on yelp.  To my disappointment, I got my chicken barbecue and all I can taste was bitter carbon deposits from the charred remains of a chicken.  Which is also cancerous by the way.  But the food was cheap.  I wouldn't come here again unless they learn how too cook their food properly.  It is a health hazard."}
{"text":"Holy cow this place is good! A hidden gem! You can tell that it's authentic Hawaiian food. Healthy and delicious"}
{"text":"Great nutritious food for a great price and it's right behind my house :)! The only reason I can't give five stars yet is because I forgot to ask for the lava sauce so it was very dry for me and reminded me of chicken teriyaki without the teriyaki sauce :( haha anyways I will be going back to try out the lava sauce and hopefully I can update my review to five stars !"}
{"text":"Had the Beef & Vegetables on Rice
Beef was tough, And had Burnt Scrapings from the Grill in it
One of the worst meals i've had in Las Vegas
Wife had the Chicken, Tender but dry
I wasn't impressed"}
{"text":"I love this place. Get the chicken and rice. The chicken is really good and flavorful. I can eat two portions at one time so I order three so I can have a snack later on too !! The price is great for the portion size. I love when a place does something simple and does a great job at it."}
{"text":"Stopped by with my girl for lunch and enjoyed the hell out of it.I like when this happens,  see it all the time and it's right down the street. Food is prepared on hot lava rocks, chicken, beef, short ribs, white or brown rice and vegetables. Quite the find and I will go until I run through the entire menu. M ' Pau brudduh."}
{"text":"Food was great! It's not like other places that drown their chicken in teriyaki. Not a long wait. The inside looks pretty cool. The food was a great value. I hope these guys grow into a bigger building. They definitely need more business. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"LAVA GRILL!!!! Where do i start....... The food is great, service is good. The food is fairly priced and very very flavorful. You get to choose between white or brown. 1.50 for extra meat. The lava sauce is delicious. I would recommend anybody to come here. Good place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Sooo delicious!!! Ate there yesterday and loved it! I was at their door at 1055 am waiting for more!! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"One word , BOMB ! I stumbled upon this place looking for the Subway restaurant nearby. I didnt want to spend a lot of money but i wanted to eat well. Entering the parking lot, I saw their big sign that read $3.99 Chicken & Veggies special. The picture looked appetizing and the price seemed right. As soon as I took my first bite, I knew I would be coming here more often. In fact, I went back 4 times that same week. 

Things to know:

*Menu is simple and straightforward
*Pricing is cheap for really good quality food
*Apparently they cook on real lava rock 
*It's a little busy during lunch hour (12-2)
*At night,  there is hardly anyone there
*Drinks are not included in price
*Staff is very friendly
*Kitchen and dining area looks clean and healthy


I'm very surprised that it's not as busy in the evening. This is a place that I recommend everyone to try! I am working my way through the menu in order. I have tried the Chicken , Beef, and Ribs. Next up is salmon,  can't wait !!"}
{"text":"Awesome new place. Let me tell ya this place is fresh fresh fresh! Athletic clubers down the street: this is your place for dinner!!!! They have a simple menu meat and rice. Meat and veggies. Rice can be white or brown. All items (except rice) is grilled. So healthy, so fresh, and and so inexpensive ! Whole meals between $3.99 and 8.99. Mostly $4.99 prices . My chicken was so tender and grilled to perfection! No burnt taste at all!  Must try!"}
{"text":"food was good, i ordered the chicken and vegetable plate with brown rice. the chicken had a very distinct smoked/wood grilled taste guessing given off by the lava rock cooking process. the vegetables was standard cabbage and carrots. the price was incredible and will return for a quick lunch option."}
{"text":"I guess I expected more based on the reviews. I ordered the beef ribs with veggies and it certainly looked good when it came out but that was about it. The ribs were over cooked and lacked any discernible flavor. I had to put salt and pepper on it just to give it some taste. When you have to add seasoning after the fact, I think that's the sign of a fail. The veggies and rice were decent. Too bad."}
{"text":"Lava Grill was a prefect, light and healthy lunch spot. The staff was friendly and efficient. I walked in with a large smelly group and they were more than happy to help us. Although the seating area is small, it was just enough to synergize. I highly recommend the salmon."}
{"text":"Ate here last night after meeting the owner Lou the night before. I was thoroughly impressed.
I had Chicken and brown rice. It was all cooked perfectly! The sauce has the perfect amount of sweetness. If you haven't tried the Lava Grill yet, you should. I was shocked at how low the prices are and how good the food is. There is no way you can get food this good at this price anywhere else."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Made to order. 
Chicken and beef type bowls among other proteins available, served on a bed of rice with veggies. Great staff and prices are good!! Don't forget the LAVA SAUCE!!"}
{"text":"Very good chicken bowl with veggies n rice for under 5 bucks. Chicken comes out lightly seasoned and the sauce is not too salty. All food appears to be cooked to order so expect a 10 minute wait or call ahead."}
{"text":"Had the chicken with brown rice and vegetables a couple of days ago it was good.Today had pork with brown rice and vegetables,a little too charred for me,wasnt terrible.Prices are good but the older dude at the register gets testy,not too friendly.I wont be back for that reason."}
{"text":"I never had a chance to write a yelp review for Lava Grill every time I ate here I was so caught up in my good food or maybe the extra head(s) that I would always bring with me so that they can get a taste. I went there on one of my spur of the moment runs while being in the area. Well what do you know, THEY ARE CLOSED. I hated to have to see them gone.

Please come back Lava Grill, where ever you are...."}
{"text":"Wow! A plate of chicken and rice for only $3.99 who could beat that! And the food was freshly made which made it even better! The restaurant is almost like a hole in the wall, but once you found it I am pretty sure you will keep coming back for more! There is plenty of parking but the restaurant is kinda small so make sure to make it intimate :)"}
{"text":"Horribly greasy food! I was hoping this would be a fresher alternative spot according to their menu and I was very disappointed with the outcome. No good at all"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because it's around the corner from my home.  Also, they were so highly rated. When we arrived the cashier was not very personable but was not rude either - I gather that it was just his personality.  I didn't take it personally.  I ordered the beef with vegetable double beef.  Also, the chicken and rice, no veg.  It came to under $13.00...sweet!! It is open and you can smell the grilling.  Another worker came from the back and was very friendly.  I asked about delivery to a big organization and they were very helpful and seemed to be willing to accommodate.  Especially because it would be for 20+ orders. We got our food and took it home.  Upon opening, I was disappointed to find that the beef was not as pictured.  Instead of pieces of cut up thin steak, it looked like ground beef, except it was quadruple chopped cheap meat.  There were lots of hard gristle bits that made it completely unappetizing.  The flavor was good but the texture was horrible. The vegetables were steamed and tasteless.  The chicken was definitely better, there was a very distinct char taste and had pretty good flavor.  I'm going to force myself to give it another try because I see the potential it has.  The flavor is there, the concept is good, the prices are great, but I would gladly pay up to $5.00 more, for better quality meat.  I'm not giving up on you yet, Lava Grill, we need more businesses like you, I speak for many who are tired of fast nasty food. I want to bring you business, but you gotta up the quality."}
{"text":"Was craving some BBQ me and my chick checked this place out for the first time. I ordered the beef plate, rice wasn't really cooked well and the meat was okay. The restaurant is covered in smoke while you sit and eat your food. I would suggest ordering take out lol"}
{"text":"craving right now, theyre delicious!! 
try their lava sauce, its bomb!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch while at Key Realty school. Good food and the people there were engaging. Has the noodle bowl and veggies. Cooked perfect and filling...for the price it's a win win.  Nice. I support this buisness and will certainly go again."}
{"text":"Today I was craving food from back home (Oahu) and I saw that I was close to this spot. Gave it a try and now they will be my go to restaurant for healthy Hawaiian-ish food. 

I ordered the beef short ribs (Kalbi) with beef and brown rice. Everything was delicious.. The Kalbi was cooked just right and the beef had some type of sauce that was made with love because it was so darn good! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the quantity of the food. There wasn't a lot of meat for the price but other then that the food was great.

The menu isn't extravagant and it's straight to the point. If you're around the area I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Don't tell them you want your meat well-done. It'll come out burned and black.

First off, when we entered the place the glass front door was extremely filthy. I have never been to a restaurant where the first thing you see is filth.

We ordered the chicken bowl without veggies and a pork bowl with veggies and an extra side of meat. The pork was ordered well done because it was pork but it came to us being very burned and we could not eat it. The restaurant was good enough to replace it with another serving of the same meat but less burned.

The vegetables were scant for the extra money we had to pay for it and my friend said it wasn't worth the money, plus the veggies were soggy and limp.

Flavor was very good but the soy sauce on the rice was just a bit overbearing and too strong for my liking.

If you just want a cup of water, they don't have it. You have to purchase one of their beverages. If you want to use the restroom, you have to go outside of the building, walk around the back and there's a rest room in the back of the building.

My friend could not take the almost-constant loud pounding coming from the kitchen area. It was giving her a headache, not to mention that the smell of grilling was strong and we finally decided to leave for a quieter and less odorous place. When we were outside in the parking lot, the smoky smell was still in our nostrils - not to mention hair and clothing, and we had to wipe out the smell from our noses with a tissue.

For the amount of chicken I had in my bowl, I didn't think it was worth the money since most of the area was consumed by rice. My friend said it was certainly not worth the money paid for HER bowl of pork with the added-on beef which was an extra charge of course.

She and I agreed that we would not be going back."}
{"text":"I had higher expectations. If the quality of the rice improved it would be much better. The rice is too mushy and moist."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday afternoon.  We both had chicken on noodles with veggies.  We both enjoyed it and felt it was good value for reasonable price.
Owner was friendly and restaurant was clean.  I like when I can see my food being prepared and here you can.
I live 4 miles away so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Positive: The food was very good and cheap. Negative: The parking lot really sucks and they only have a few tables to eat at. 

Most people were standing around waiting for their take out. They only had two guys running the whole place cooking and taking orders so they should probably hire one more assistant chef or something. I had the chicken and veggies with brown rice. Just a few tweaks and this place could be a real gem in this not-so-good part of town."}
{"text":"Great food , great owners! I got the chicken bowl and my wife got the beef bowl both were great. The taste reminnds me of ha ing those bbq cookouts out in hawaii. One thing i would buy is a shirt cuz i like the logo and the place."}
{"text":"Love this place! They're up and coming they've only been open for 8 months now. For the quality of food and the price this place definitely gets 5 stars. Just stopped in and got dinner for me and the hubby and it was under $9! It's nice, simple, and healthy. Great customer service as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience if your looking for a healthy delicious meal. Order ahead of time and take to go as dining in is not easy. The quality of food and price is something not to miss!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out.. food was great !! teriyaki sause amazing the meat was cooked perfect very lean. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"OMG.....Best place for hawaiian food!!  Everything is Soooo fresh, perfectly cooked!!!
They should open one in Cali!"}
{"text":"Have been closed for the past 10 days or so. Tried calling several times only to get a recording saying will reopen on the 24th  of October.  It's  the 3rd of November."}
{"text":"Here with my wife- yummy food. Nice change of pace. Food smells great as soon as you walk in."}
{"text":"Such a great place. The food is so fresh and healthy. A good price for a great amount of food. The service is wonderful. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this place always leaves me satisfied. Not this last time I went, first of all the workers were acting as though I was inconveniencing them by not being prepared to order. I felt completely rush and received death stares from this fairly large oriental man in the kitchen. I didn't feel welcome and the man taking my order seemed irritated. It was a good thing they have good food at a good price or I would have asked for my money back. I hope that they were just having an off day cause if I experience service like that again, I will not hesitate to share my opinions and defer people from going there."}
{"text":"The only thing I could say about this place is, great food at a affordable price!!!

I work down the street from Lava Grill and I started frequenting this place since the first day they opened their doors. I come here around three times during the week. The taste of the food is phenomenal. You can never go wrong with any of their dishes ,they offer pork, chicken, steak and short ribs. Do not be afraid of trying any off their food, I guarantee that you will love it. The staff and owners are really helpful and humble, in my opinion. As you can see, I highly recommend this place to have a good and affordable lunch.

Thank you Lava Grill!!!!"}
{"text":"All i can say is great food and very decent prices. Everything was fresh and perfectly cooked. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"The whole family stopped there and we loved it.  The Lava Grill team is so friendly and the food was healthy, good and what a value.  Give them a try, you will love it."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken w/ veggies! 
Great customer services and inexpensive!
They customer service i amazing, veggies super fresh"}
{"text":"I try to come here at least once a month. It's a local owner and I like to support the community especially cause I get tired of eating at chains. I like the service. Louie is friendly and knows everyone that comes in to dine. The food is healthy and simple. I usually call in to order my food and then I pick up to ensure I have enough time to get back to work. Everything is fresh and made to order so don't be surprised if it takes a few minutes to get your food, but the cook is always slaving away at the grill! These two guys are great and I'm happy that Lava Grill is close by."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ chicken over rice and lava sauce  was very good ! Go in and try it for ur self don't pass this place  up."}
{"text":"5 stars for this type of food  :)
VERY good food, VERY good prices, fun, creative decor. I tried the chicken with veggies and brown rice plate, $3.99 special- good AND healthy :) You could tell it was cooked over lava rocks.  And they actually have a good assortment of Hawaiian Sun drinks. Definitely try it out, and when you do, don't forget to ask for the yummy Lava Sauce."}
{"text":"Wow! A new favorite. Fresh, flavorful. Family owned. Healthy. Local. Need I say more?!"}
{"text":"Really good prices for decent sized portions. I got the noodles and chicken, and my fiance got the brown rice with chicken. My portion was larger than his, so we ended up sharing mine. The food was really good, and my only complaint is that some of my chicken was so burnt that it was inedible."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic!!! The prices are amazing! The atmosphere, fast take out... Everything is served in styrofoam containers... 
We ate in the \"dining room\" .. No table service here... Serve your own drinks and pick up your styrofoam entrees at the counter... 
The cook was very pleasant and asked how we enjoyed his food. He even asked if we needed anything... The cashier, (older guy) not so pleasant... Nice enough... But kinda grumpy.  We will order take out for sure... 
Again, the food is healthier and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is yummy!!!! The day we went they were out of beef but they had yummy chicken noodles and beef short ribs. Can't wait to go back and try more things."}
{"text":"Lava Grill is a simple, affordable, and casual spot good for take out orders or a quick dine in. 

They serve brown or white rice bowls with your choice of grilled meats and the option to add veggies or double meat.

Chicken starts at $3.99 with salmon being the most expensive at $6.99. 

I got a salmon box with added veggies & a chicken bowl. 

I wasn't expecting the salmon to be so good, but it was really cooked perfectly aka MOIST! I definitely recommend it.

My co-worker said the grilled chicken was good although it looked a little burned upon first glance.

\"Looks can be deceiving\" must be their motto as the gun shot on the door almost scared me away. I'm glad I stayed and I'm glad to support a local business.

I suggest getting sauce as I can see some people thinking the meats are bland. 

They take cash and cards."}
{"text":"The food is so good and so fresh we had to come back two days in a row. Although their menu is very simple, it is very delicious and satisfying. Do not forget to ask for some lava sauce. Its not teriyaki sauce or bbq sauce. It's lava sauce because it is made with lave (love). ;)"}
{"text":"Had beef and vegetables over brown rice. The beef is chipped, and there's a good amount. I like the seasoning they use--sweet, but not too sweet. The veg were nicely cooked. Prices are reasonable.  The staff seemed really stressed for some reason, though."}
{"text":"What can I say about Lava Grill that Others haven't said already....This is gonna be another Short and Sweet one.

They have a Very Simple and Straight-forward Menu, You Order what you want, They ask you if you want extra meat for I believe $2 more. (If I get this wrong, they do have a Menu Board over the Counter that explains everything).

The food was Good and Healthy...But My Chicken was a Little on the Dry side, and the Veggies were cooked to My liking. They do offer you White or Brown Rice.

They do have Free Refills for the Fountain Drinks, and Canned Hawaiian Sun in a Variety of Flavors, and Bottled Water next to the Fountain Drink Machine. 

It is a little small for a Family to dine there...because of limited seating, I didn't see a Restroom, but you can ask them.

**There are a Few Con's that you should be aware of: 1) If You Do Dine in, Please be aware that you will Smell like BBQ when you leave, and it does get smoky in there! 2) The parking in front of the Businesses in the area are 15 Minute Parking Stalls...So you will have to park in the Middle stalls...that place can get busy, and the stalls get filled quickly! 3) There are No High chairs for Toddlers or Babies, should you Dine with Any little ones. 

I Tried it Once, I have Tasted Better....But, that's Just Me! I will be back, but only if I am in the Area!"}
{"text":"Not very fond by this place.  My boyfriend has been wanting to try this for a few months now so I gave in.  But from walking in, it was very HOT inside.  Then you meet the grumpy man behind the counter.  Now let's talk about the food, not really much to choose from.  I had the chicken noodle, which was drenched in sauce.  My boyfriend had the chicken with rice, that tasted exactly the same.  NOTHING BUT SAUCE."}
{"text":"If you say you open at 1100 and your sign is lit up \"open\", make sure you are actually open at 1100 and not 1110.  These little things do make a difference.  Instead you lost a customer, and as I'm getting back in my car, I see the employee unlocking the door but making no effort to reacquire  my business."}
{"text":"When a place let's you see the entire kitchen operations, it's usually a good sign. No exception here. Well organized, clean and turning out quality food. Portions are respectable for the price and you don't feel guilty for eating \"food-like\" products. There's a family owned feel to this place located in an unassuming strip mall. 
In the spirit of constructive criticism, the place could use a little interior design help, as the setting doesn't really match the level of the food. One more note would be to use plates instead of takeout boxes for customers who want to eat on site. Lastly, keeping the Windows clean would go a long way to improving the clean feeling.
All in all, a great value and I'll most likely return next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ran over right before they closed. Got chicken and veggies cooked fresh to order. Yummmm! Even with extra sauce it's a nice healthy alternative! Will keep going back!"}
{"text":"Great food and look out for their special menu.. I got double chicken..
Ample Parking Space
Only reason why I am giving it a 4 star because how smokey it can get in the restaurant.. I don't feel their is not enough exhaust vents.."}
{"text":"Place is bomb!  It's a little hole in the wall with great food.  If you're looking for something more \"upscale\" then move on.  This is a great place to eat and hang out.  Smells like a backyard BBQ when you walk in, but I don't mind the awesome aroma."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars for service and 3 stars for food and I'll explain why. They took down chairs for us after cleaning their dining room and staying open for me and my family (boyfriend, baby and I) instead of closing early when we came in on a Friday night. 

I always passed this place and never knew it was a barbecue type teriyaki joint. Right up my alley. I'm a big fan of teriyaki madness but the unique thing about this place is that the meat is cooked over lava rocks giving a unique charred flavor to the meat. Boyfriend ordered pork and I ordered chicken with veggies and noodles. If you're trying to be healthy it's a great option and definitely good portion but if you're hungry like me who hadn't eaten much all day id suggest ordering more meat. 

My portion was an average size but I was still hungry. Like I said didn't eat much that day. My meat had a good flavor though, noodles had good texture and the veggies too. My boyfriends pork was very juicy and tasty. The workers or wonders were very friendly. 4 stars for service and 3 stars for food."}
{"text":"First time trying this spot.. So I tried a chicken bowl and it was not that great! Who likes burnt chicken?? I mean nothing wrong with well done but this was over done!"}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price and friendly people behind the counter?  Count me in!  Ordered Chicken and beef box w/veggies and beef noodles w/veggies too.  Give it a try and you will be amazed."}
{"text":"Great food. Love the flavor on veggies. Chicken on point. They have brown rice which is good. Bomb food."}
{"text":"Sooo good!! Super fresh! Good prices. I do think they picked the wrong location for this place its in a small plaza hidden away if, you don't pay attention you'll miss it.  Anyway, glad we found it its so good.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Location/setting is under whelming, but great food at great value! Definitely going back for more!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect example of \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" Yes, it's a hole in the wall... but do not drive past, bc you'll totally be missing out! How can you go wrong with meat cooked on a flaming hot lava-rock powered grill?! You can't!!

They have a limited menu, but that makes no deferent in the slightest. The pork (good), beef (ok), and chicken (excellent) had a fabu char-grilled flavor, they really know how to put the Maillard reaction to good use! (Next time we're gonna try the short ribs!)  The veggies are perfectly al dente. And you've got a choice between white or brown rice. 

The only down side was everything was served in styrofoam. We know this is \"Hawaiian Style\" of food service, but uhhhhg yuck. Still I'm not gonna knock their overall excellent food and super-friendly service for this one minuet detail."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves really good and the customer service is great. The cook is really friendly too. Ask him about the brown rice! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I come here every so often for lunch and I'm never disappointed. I usually get the beef noodle box and the beef is so juicy and flavorful and the noodles are perfectly cooked. The veggies are also steamed perfectly and not too hard."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. It's so affordable, and you can taste the grilled flavor on the food, but NOT burnt. It's quiet in here whenever I come, and food prep takes about 10 minutes, then it's ready. I have gotten the #6 pork/veggies/white rice twice and will order it again and again. This place is convenient and easy to love."}
{"text":"We've now been eating here for 10 months, the food continues to be very good, when you factor in the price it is great value."}
{"text":"The food here are soooo good! And soo cheap lol. When me and my bf came in, the restaurant was HOT as heck. Apparently their ac broke down but that didnt stop us from eating there. There was only one person working there at that time and he looked like a manager or maybe owner...? He was nice to us and even gave us free cannes juice to make up for the hot dining area lol."}
{"text":"Yum.  Hard to find good casual food in Las Vegas.  Entire meal is tasty and fairly healthy including the veggie side.       Nice people.   Will definitely come back when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Loved the grilled meats (chicken and kalbi). Comfort food; hot rice,fresh veggies and flavorful chicken and beef. Next time I want to try the party platters. Great food for a great price. Brown rice is also offered."}
{"text":"I just arrived in Vegas & was hungry. My daughter just moved to this side of Vegas so we used Yelp to get suggestions. This place is amazing .We got chicken with veggies & beef with veggies. The chicken was grilled & cut into strips laying over a bed of brown rice. There was a slight sweet sauce as well. The veggies were extremely awesome. The beef was shredded & also over a bed of rice with the awesome sauce & veggies. The tables were few but turn over was fairly quick. The place is clean & the owners were awesome & went out of their way to help us. My daughter had her baby with her, who needed changed & they let her use the employee restroom. Very healthy option for lunch or dinner. I rarely give 5 stars so this says a lot about how great the food is as well as all other aspects."}
{"text":"Good prices and decent portions- just enough to fill you up. 

The food is fresh- grilled meat, fresh veggies, and a choice of brown or white rice. 

I ordered their signature chicken w/ veggies combo. For the most part, it was good, but there were a lot of burnt pieces of meat. 

Don't come here looking for an ambient dine-in; two-seater tables and not much else. You'll be here strictly for the food!

Not the best first impression, but I'd like to try the rest of the menu out."}
