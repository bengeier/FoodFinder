{"text":"Palio is one of the places we go to when we come back to Vegas a few times a year. The service is always excellent and the pastries are to die for! It's a great stop,  especially if you want to grab something quick and tasty before you head to the Bellagio Fine Arts Exhibit."}
{"text":"Best coffee and Danish you can buy. I always get the cheese Danish and the cappuccino. I love the little sugar stick that comes with it too. Skip the buffet an enjoy quality breakfast."}
{"text":"This is not the \"typical Las Vegas overpriced crap.\" It is overpriced heavenly food. 
The quiche lorrain was light and fluffy and delicious and the mocha (the chocolate as a whole) was to die for."}
{"text":"Pricey and appetizing. The palmier was perfectly crispy flakey. Latte & savory crepe OK. $5 OJ a bit hard to swallow (but I did). Beats a breakfast buffet of tired, rubbery eggs and limp bacon - but it comes with a cost."}
{"text":"Before there were a lot of independent coffeehouses in Las Vegas (i.e., 7 years ago or so), places like Palio were the only refuge from Starbucks or other corporate coffee chains. What makes Palio interesting still today is that yes, it's in the Bellagio and so it's a Strip property, but it still manages to pull off great coffee and pastries, has a pretty cool European vibe and it's one place where service has always been good even though probably 95% of its guests are one-time visitors and not often very well-behaved.

The theme is Italian (Renaissance) and so the decor, pastries, gelato and of course coffee offerings all reflect that. Bold espresso, perfectly-foamed cappuccino and strong drip brews never disappoint and are served in a style that reminds you of Europe (until you turn around and bump into some wayward, lone tourist who's plopped itself down and claimed a 4-seat table without ordering anything, but I digress...) 

Seriously, the coffee's great and service is well-done. This place is also a pretty good date spot - try the eclairs, Napoleons or millefeuille along with that latte macchiato! - as long as you make sure not to go during high-traffic times. If you can snag one of the few tables near the windows, you can get a view of the Bellagio pool area with its trees and cabanas. 

3 stars overall, because it's a little cramped and when it's really busy, many tourists act über-entitled, pushing in front of you or blocking out table space or hovering around the creamer/sugar area for no reason. Plus, the coffee and pastries are a bit expensive and hard to justify at the price...until you remember you are on the Strip. Besides, it's well situated near the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art, not on the main casino floor and somewhere that you can easily grab a coffee and for a few moments forget where you are. And unlike some other places on the Strip, what brings you back to reality is not the often-typical \"OK, whatever\" service ethic, but tourist behavior."}
{"text":"I should have known better. This place seems to he one of those that you either love or hate. The cappuccino was not perfect because the milk-foam was not correctly done (definitely too thick). The choice for breakfast did not fulfill  my expectations: a place like this should offer some healthy options. However, plates, cups and the overall appeal of the seating area seemed appropriate for a highly priced cafe."}
{"text":"Over priced, soggy, nasty sandwich. Extremely disappointed. I ordered the italian sandwich and the bread was all mushy. Wouldn't go back there."}
{"text":"This was a great spot for a quick breakfast.  The feel was like a cozy coffee shop and you can grab your food and drink to go, or enjoy at a table above the Bellagio pool.  I had the cinnamon roll, which was soft and delicious with the perfect amount of icing.  The Mocha slush was just like a frozen chocolate milk, sweet but highly recommended if you are a chocolate milk fan. My wife had a croissant, which always seems boring to me, but I must say it was amazing.  Fluffy and full of flavor.  You can't go wrong with breakfast here.  We plan to go back tomorrow as we finish our Vegas trip."}
{"text":"The almond croissant was the BEST I've ever had and I've been to many bakeries all over the world. It was wonderfully flakey and buttery with a lovely, almost creamy but chewy almond almond paste highlight in the center. Very unique and different but AMAZING! 
The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that the coffee is not good. The cappuccino was mediocre at best and the cafe au lait was so bad I didn't drink it. 
Your best bet is to get a couple baked goods to go and then maybe hit up a real espresso bar to pair it."}
{"text":"I always love their gourmet coffee and pastries here! Whenever I'm in Vegas, I always have to stop into Palio for their most amazing almond and chocolate croissants! They have the best croissants in California! The cappuccino and ice blended mocha is phenomenal, too! I wish there was a Palio in Los Angeles, so I wouldn't have to travel hours away when I'm badly craving for their coffee and pastries!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here twice and the breakfast panini was stellar.
Perfectly grilled, crispy and soft bread.  GREAT service in the morning.
Nice place to get started in the morning. 

Didn't try any pastry or gelato - but the pastry looked fantastic.

Only going with 4-stars because the espresso was not great and it's the first thing I want in the morning."}
{"text":"Nice place with an Italian character to the decor.  Good coffee, although you'll pay a bundle.  Cute complimentary mini jars of jam/marmalade/honey.  Great view of the pool, though, if you get a table by the window.  Nice place to hang out for a while, although pricey (as you'd expect for a nice cafe inside the Bellagio)."}
{"text":"What's not to like??... it's a little pricey... but nowhere NEAR as pricey as getting the same thing delivered to you room.

They opened at six sharp, all smiles, good quality muffins and fruit.

Latte was $6, plain coffee was $4, Bran Muffin $4.75 and banana was $2.  What else does one need?"}
{"text":"Kind of difficult to find, but my friend and I were looking for a place to have mid-afternoon coffee.  This place was further into the casino and near the other shops.  I probably wouldn't have noticed it otherwise... thanks Yelp for leading the way!  I got a latte and Dulce de Leche croissant (see photo), which was excellent!  I've never had a soft fluffy croissant with yummy caramel in the middle. Had it been later in the day, I totally would have gone for one of their alcoholic coffees since they sounded excellent!  I thought their prices were normal for Vegas, not cheap but a decent value compared to other expensive places.  Next time I want to come for the pastries and the dessert.  See photos for how cute the Tiramisu cup is!  The space is small ((I wouldn't go with more than 4 people)) with nice ambiance and soft Italian music.  The windows have an obstructed view of pool and give lots of light.  I liked it a lot and it was nice to get away from the casinos.  We enjoyed getting coffee in our exploration of the strip and it's nice to stop at the Bellagio for the seasonal floral display and the water show (both free!)"}
{"text":"Loved this place when my husband was given a 4 night staycation compliments from USO Las Vegas. We are MLife MVPs and we're given automatic discounts for our coffee/food. MGM resorts take good care of their active duty and military veterans. But beware there's a lot of snooty senior citizens that infest this place. When I went alone with my babies first thing in the morning, I was in line to get my cappuccino and a pastry for my 3 year old. While my 1 year old was babbling in line, an old lady who was sitting close by told me \"can you please make him be quiet?\" I just glared at her for a long time and looked appalled at the fact that this is a noisy cafe as it is. Machines whirling and ppl conversing. It ruined my morning since all mama bears know that they need their coffee to function.  I ignored her and moved along. Advice for moms with young kids: old ppl will bully you here, but stick it thru and tell them if they want peace and quiet, refer them to a nearby cemetery to drink their coffee..smh."}
{"text":"Extremely good coffee, pastries, and dessert options. Great location for people watching."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for ten years. Last spring the portion size of muesli was cut in half! Still come for coffee and quiche, but disappointed at chintzy cost cutting measures!"}
{"text":"Best value at the Bellagio. Good quality food quick service for a busy coffee shop.  I had the Italian sandwich (heated) which used the same meats from the buffet.   My girlfriend had the tuna sandwich which was really big.  They had a large fresh fruit bowl which was excellent.  Great for breakfast."}
{"text":"Desserts where are just ok but can hit the spot if you're on the run and want to grab something real fast before partyaaayying all night. Vegas baby I love it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been coming here almost every time I go to Vegas and ever since Bellagio opened. They have the BEST Bear Claw here and the only food item I order from here. It's really buttery and the texture is flaky. So good! Even though it's a bit pricey, I think it's worth it. I also tried their Iced Coffees and hot coffees. Their coffees are good and they're strong but it goes well with the Bear Claw.

Service is good. You can use your mLife card to get points here.

There's a lot of seating inside and some seating outside. 

Overall, love this place and will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I came here this morning but I was very disappointed. From pervious reviews of yelpers, I thought it should be a bakery/pastry shop. However, it doesn't have a large variety of pastries and just croissant, danish and some sandwiches. If you are looking for pastries, come to Jean Philips instead."}
{"text":"Like most things at the Bellagio, this place is really really overpriced, except unlike the rest of the Bellagio the customer service here is much lower than it should be. It's a decent coffee shop, with decent bakery case options for quick food, but seriously nothing impressive. They aren't wow'ing anyone with a $10 almond croissant, or $12 side dish of pfarro and veggies. 

When it's your only option for a quick meal (like it was for me while I was here for work) then you deal with it, but their attitude and their prices make me roll my eyes hard."}
{"text":"the turkey & grape croissant was very very good! bailey's coffee was alright. a bit pricey but tasty food and cool decor"}
{"text":"Best desserts in the entire world! The pastry chef is world renowned and all of the choices are sure to please. Don't be fooled by the larger selection at the other hotels (like Paris)... they have to offer more choices because none of them match up to Palio's.  

If you go to vegas, I'm sure you'll want to stop by this place multiple times once you try it!"}
{"text":"Great little spot right next to the guest elevators. Cafe Gelato is right opposite. Very nice interior with 9 small tables. Well staffed fast service in the morning to accomodate to go customers. Had a delicious cherry danish, Orange juice, prosciutto/egg sandwich. I loved the pesto inside. They are heating up sandwiches but else no hot breakfast. Have to return to try fresh squeezed green juices."}
{"text":"Very expensive. I was not impressed with the quality of food"}
{"text":"Though the prices at Palio preclude me from giving it a four star review, I still have a generally favorable opinion of the place.  The little take-out spot provides a very nice quick food option at the Bellagio, and that fact gives it worth.

Yes, you will be paying $5 for a bottle of apple juice, and a few dollars more than you would expect for salads and scones, but the quality is good and you can eat and be back out on the casino floor in twenty minutes."}
{"text":"A great dulce de leche croissant! If you are at the Bellagio looking for a good pastry, stop by here and get a croissant.  It won't disappoint :)"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need a pick-me-up during all that hard work at the slot machines.  Especially when you've played until 2am the night before.  Palio offers great lattes and mochas, light snacks and pastries.  My fave?  The giant cheese danish.  6\" across, loaded with cheese, sweet pastry.  YUM!  Could only eat half for my snack, and then had the rest for a tasty breakfast the next morning.  

Nice location away from the casino, just past the guest elevators.  You can relax and enjoy your caffeine fix away from the general casino noise."}
{"text":"Mary Berry would be so proud of this puff pastry!! Best bear claw I've ever had. Wish I could eat it every day. Must go here if you love baked goods."}
{"text":"Nutella Pocket was amazing, and it is my favorite not to miss cafe spot for whenever I visit Vegas! I wish I could get it's recipe from somewhere because no one else sells it!"}
{"text":"Cute place especially with outdoor seating option overlooking the pool but really pricey.  Decent cappuccino but pricey"}
{"text":"Have been here several times for a quick bite or coffee and the food has never been something to speak about.

This time the food was disgusting, tasteless and the service even worse - people with a curt and unpleasant attitude and demeanor. The only positive thing is that the veranda outside is s nice place to sit and relax. Otherwise, don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Overpriced, but what isn't around here? The baked goods (brioche, croissant) actually were excellent and the espresso was decent. Lovely covered outdoor patio had heat lamps and a nice view of the pool area."}
{"text":"This coffee shop was AMAZING! We have been here three days in a row . My mom got a regular coffee and the ham and cheese brioche which was delicious. I got a Spanish mocha with soy and a quiche and both were so yummy! Possibly the best latte I have ever had and that says a lot, having worked at a coffee house for over 2 Years."}
{"text":"vegas has the best croissants/chocolate croissants and this place does not disappoint. bouchon still has the best cheese danishes ever! but this place has seating which is a plus. like any other place, palio averages $4 a pastry. well worth it for the croissant."}
{"text":"We were on the prowl for a nice dessert to top off our Vegas adventure, and the food on display here caught our eye. A little bit of the exquisite, but served in an unexpecting little coffee shop with a European vibe with a nice view of the Bellagio pool. The place fit the bill overall.

We ended up getting a small fruit tart here, elaborately designed which is why it caught our eye. The service was friendly and that little tart? Delicious. The vibe was nice and quite, and might have made a good twist to those looking for some peace after venturing on the strip. 

Overall,  enjoyable and a place we might try again for a different dessert in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I have to take away 2 stars due to how over priced it is and how slowly the line moved. (That's the S.O.P. for everything to do with the Bellagio)

We had a few of their breakfast sandwiches and the Lachs bagel.  All excellent.  The coffee was very good too.

If you are out at the pool or don't want to leave the hotel to get some quick grub this is probably your cheapest option (but still not cheap) 

As we will never return to the Bellagio we will likely never visit Palio again."}
{"text":"Ham and cheese was about as bland as can be. Even with honey mustard it tasted like it was from Schnucks. The chicken breast salad was super lacking in every facet.

Only reason this isn't a 1 or 2 star review is the staff. They were awesome little old ladies, and one even went to another shop to procure some mustard for me."}
{"text":"Any coffee place that includes alcohol in their coffees has FIVE stars.  This place is no exception.

They have a number of specialty coffees from the Baileys (dark roast with Baileys Irish Creme) to the Irish (dark roast with WHISKEY!!) and to about 4 or 5 more.  Those two were the two I tried... they were both EXCELLENT.

I also had a tuna sandwich one time and the second time had a ham and cheese.  The tuna was better than the ham and cheese only because the ham and cheese was stored inside plastic wrap and the tomato made the bread somewhat wet, which is not appealing to me.

My friends had a rasberry coffee and a regular cappuccino which were both excellent as well.

Love the decor!  It has an irish feel to it, but I don't think I'm educated enough to recognize where those flags in there were from.  It almost looked like clan flags, but I really don't know. haha

A little pricey, but what else do you expect when you're in the Bellagio??"}
{"text":"Palio! Not paleo! But worth it!! 

Found this rare gem! I mean rare because there really isn't many sit down coffee shops on the strip is there!!?! I need and want just a good cup of cappuccino or a latte for breakfast. That doesn't come in a paper cup! I mean seriously! Nothing I hate more than drinking a good coffee in a paper cup. Unless it's plain black coffee! 

Found out they have 2 of my breakfast essentials: croissants and lattes in a proper plates!! :D Yey! Took a little bit to find this but alas! It's so cute! Love the art and decor! Love my pool view! The patio was open too but of course full!! 

My latte and a chocolate croissant came to $15+. It's Vegas! It's worth it! Really glad I got the last chocolate croissant though. That thing was MASSIVE!  I didn't even finish half but I had a blast playing with my food!

They had other food too: sandwiches! Toast! It smells all kind of delicious in here! I'm good with my latte! Huge latte and huge croissant! What else is good! Oh and champagne!! Wooo!"}
{"text":"Nice coffee shop located close to the casino and guest elevators.  I stopped in the other day to get an Italian Soda as an afternoon pick me up.  The staff was friendly and the raspberry italian soda was delicious...although a little bit pricey at nearly $6."}
{"text":"Salmon bagel, fruit plate and an americano.  Sitting on outside balcony overlooking the Bellagio pool.  Perfect Vegas breakfast or lunch.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Taking a break from the Bellagio Poker Room, I wandered around until I found this gem of a coffee house with prepared sandwiches and meals.  While most of the dining inside Bellagio and surrounding casinos and hotels is pricey and expensive, I happened upon what I think is one of the best deals around.  The chicken wraps and prepared salads are hearty, delicious, and great price.  My choice of chicken Caesar salad wrap cost me $12...what a BARGAIN!  It was a hearty portion that filled me up for lunch.   Other options like the prepared salads seemed a good deal for the portion size, and much cheaper than dining at the typically expensive in-house restaurants.  The coffee bar is pricey (I paid $6.50 for a medium cappuccino and $4 for a cookie).  Location is convenient, with outside seating that overlooks the pool area.  Strangely, this day, there was a strong windstorm that closed down the pool area.  The location of the balcony alcove we were at kept most of the heavy wind away but made it difficult to open and close the doors."}
{"text":"This lil gem has to be the only reason one would stay at the Bellagio!

No seriously.

They have great coffee, never once did I have a bad coffee when staying here. They have bagels and cream cheese.

But the best bit? The jam dearlings, the JAM!!!

Little tubs of mouthwatering-awesomesauceness!!

I fell a wee bit in love. You see I'm one of those weird people that gets a blueberry bagel, smothers it in cream cheese and then tops it when blueberry jam from the wee tubs.

Then sits there and moans audibly while I enjoy the delight that is my breakfast before a day full of shopping again.

I hear they have great pastries too, however I never got around to trying any!!"}
{"text":"$8.50 for an 8.4 oz red bull... enough said!. The ham & cheese ciabatta was very good at $11.50. Sigh... buy your drinks off the strip when possible."}
{"text":"Palio at the Bellagio was a nice place to stop by for breakfast in the morning on the way to the pool. Palio offers coffee, lattes, mochas, light snacks, sandwiches and pastries and is open all day.  It is somewhat overpriced, but everything in Vegas is pretty pricey nowadays!"}
{"text":"Quaint little coffee shop with yummy sandwiches.  Of course, you're dealing with the vegas price of a sandwich but I found one of the most amazing tuna sandwiches that I have ever had. Just simple but the bread combo and fresh tuna was just superb!  Ideal for a coffee break after hitting the slots!"}
{"text":"Go here to interact with the staff, they are worth it. The food is just like what you would get anywhere else."}
{"text":"Well, it seems all good things must come to an end. 

We used to send everybody we knew here. We used to say if you're going to Vegas come here and get the Nutella pocket and the ham and cheese croissant. They were giant and delicious and chock-full of all the delicious ingredients that you wanted. 

It seems that somebody became El cheapo chef-o and now they are stingy with the ingredients that make you want these things in the first place.

We just spent $45 on three pastries and three coffees. The iced lattes are about the same as they've always been but the croissants and pockets are complete disappointment.

All the manager had to say was she noticed a change in a few people had complained. Good thing there's no shortage of great places to eat in Las Vegas, this one's off our list now."}
{"text":"A little pricey, no gluten friendly options but you can a fruit bowl or plate. Coffee is fine. Don't expect anything extraordinary."}
{"text":"A quiet oasis from the hustle of Las Vegas. We stopped in for a quick breakfast pastry and coffee on our last morning in town. Croissants are flaky and buttery. Danish had just enough filling inside a light pastry. Muffins were moist and flavorful. Cafe au lait was very good."}
{"text":"Admittedly I always start craving their pastries a week before I get in to Vegas. When we stayed at other hotels, we'd make a trip here for breakfast. The last time round, we stayed at the Bellagio and the best part of my mornings were indulging in my favorite almond croissant and pain aux raisin. Fat (and happy) girl in me, yep."}
{"text":"Really good coffee, good desserts. Sleeve is way too thin, was walking with my beverage while my hand was getting burnt and had to keep switching hands."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Santana row in that it has a very high price due to locale and stigma, but ultimately has mediocre taste.

The quality of the ingredients could have been better.
The chai we ordered was way too sweet, and as far as taste, you could get that a drive thru for $2.

Nice presentation, though.

I had a double espresso that had a really weird taste that was acidic.

The Dulce De Leche Croissant, Apple Cauchon and the Eclair were  A-OK."}
{"text":"Solid place for some fresh pastries and coffee. Pastries are 8/10 and the latte 7/10. Classic pastries well baked. The latte was decent but a bit too airy. Definitely has a nice outdoor seating area near the pool where you can sit and enjoy your food. Its semi shady so you can enjoy the summer morning heat before it hits 100. 

I still haven't managed to find a proper latte in Vegas yet."}
{"text":"I had the best croissant of my life at Palio when recently staying at the Bellagio.  I grabbed it to go with me when I was catching my flight back to Houston, and honestly wish I hadn't waited until the last day to try this place out because it was seriously THAT good!

In addition to the wide variety of pasteries, they also have quick, friendly service and a nice dining area indoors and outdoors to enjoy your food."}
{"text":"Stopped by to get some organic juices. They are cold pressed, already made bottles in the fridge.

I got the beets one. They have 2 other flavors: green juice and carrot"}
{"text":"This was a great place to get some coffee or a quick bite to eat in the AM. Located in the way to the swimming pools and near the guest elevators. Had nice choices of pastry, breakfast sandwiches, fruit and juice in the AM."}
{"text":"This quaint little cafe is adorable and the staff even more so! 

A deliciously solid soy chai tea latte was had as I waited for my cell phone to charge. 

Unfortunately this review is going to stay short as well it's a cafe and I had a latte but it's definitely worth a check in if you happen to find yourself in the Bellagio"}
{"text":"Palio has alot of very tasty things. What we come for is one item that is the best you can get anywhere. The cinnamon rolls. The exterior of the roll is dense. The sweet cream frosting on top is absolutely devine. Layer after layer the cake becomes more and more moist. This compliments the frosting greatly and once you realize you've finished the whole thing. No matter how full you are, you want another."}
{"text":"I've been to Palio more times than I can count, and I absolutely love it. It's a really cute, quiet coffee shop and cafe near the Bellagio pool entrance, decorated in a charming Italian accents. If it weren't Vegas (where there are a million other things I want to do) I'd be happy to come sit here and leisurely read the newspaper or a book. Instead I always drop in for a double espresso macchiato served in a perfect little cup and then make my way--rejuvenated--out into the exciting and noisy Vegas din. They serve pastries from Jean Philippe Patisserie, and so if you choose anything from the case, you know it's going to be good. Friendly service, and a perfect drink every time. I wish I had one of these in my home town!"}
{"text":"Came by for my usual chocolate croissant and cappuccino and was pleasantly surprised that they've remodeled. The new patio is gorgeous! !  I could sit there all day. I complimented the manager and she was so sweet, she talked to me about they changes that were made and she was so nice she made me feel right at home (if home were a cafe in Rome). Seriously though, they use illy coffee, so if you love coffee like I do, you know you can't beat Illy, and the barristas there know their way around the espresso machine. But my favorite is the chocolate croissant, it's so fresh, buttery, and flaky,  and they DON'T skimp on the chocolate, it's THE BEST croissant in town. All the pastries look delicious though. And they have sandwiches too. It's a good place for a quick bite or to sit and relax a while."}
{"text":"Had the fruit plate (delicious and fresh). Almond croissant hubby stated was \"exceptional\". Which is a rare compliment.  He also had the prosciutto breakfast sandwich which was good. Preferred this breakfast to the bellagio buffet honestly."}
{"text":"I thought it was truly odd that Bellagio would have a cafe (Palio) located DIRECTLY across the walkway from Cafe Gelato, as they BOTH serve coffee/espresso drinks and pastries. Strange, no?

Anyhow, since I had visited Cafe Gelato the previous evening, I decided to give Palio a go. I ordered a mocha -- and it was among the best I've had! And believe me, I've had my share of mochas! It was super smooth (not grainy or powdery) and had a nice creamy consistency. 

Service was very friendly and quick, as I received my drink in under 5 minutes. They also offer a great selection of pastries and baked goods. There is also a good number of cozy plush seats outside of the cafe along the hotel walkway (still within Bellagio). There is also some seating inside the cafe as well."}
{"text":"Borderline fandom (3.5 stars for me), Palio is a great quick eats spot especially for breakfast.

It's a bit hard to find a place to grab a quick bite to eat in the magnificent Bellagio, since most restaurants are sit down and take your time kind of places. Palio provides some great breakfast brioches, a healthy assortment of fresh and sweet berries, and really large pastries.  I mean really large.

The primary reason why I can't give it a full 4 star yelpin' is their prices.  For 2 people - 2 breakfast brioches, 2 freshly squeezed OJs, and a tray of fresh berries....almost $40. I guess it helped that the brioches were nice, warm, tasty, and exploding with meat (see image), but still...that's pretty pricey for a sit down, quick eats kind of place.

But yet, I will still claim my fandom because the food was still good, and I did mention they baked goods/pastry portions were huge right?

There is seating inside, but if you are into people watching, or even more comfortable chairs, there are couch-like seats outside as well.  Enjoy your time, it's easy to find.  It's practically outside of the hotel room elevator area."}
{"text":"I'm glad to say they're still serving great Expresso here. The queue was huge this morning so I gave it a miss but dropped in after lunch."}
{"text":"Bad customer service, bad presentation of coffee. For $12, all I got is a weak liquor coffee in a paper cup."}
{"text":"Delicious croissants and Danishes. Outstanding. Fresh, toasty so melt in your mouth wonderful. The newly expanded outside seating area is nice too."}
{"text":"This place was perfect!!  I wanted a quiet little coffee corner to eat a yummy something & drink some good cappuccinos.  And that's exactly what I got here... 

Despite an unfriendly greeting, the visit went well.  By unfriendly, I mean a snippy \"hello\" with a bit of a snarly face followed by nothing!  Awkwaaard, hah.  Oh well, imaginary hand-to-the-face, (ie. \"talk to my hand\") was in order.  You WILL NOT ruin my morning, errr, afternoon. 

Ordered a decent slice of pumpkin cheesecake which tasted better than it looked, and cappuccino which was pretty amazing!  Cappuccinos were served with caramel flavored rock candy stir sticks, such a neat twist to adding sweetener. 

The interior is small, but super cute with intricately & colorfully decorated glass dishware displayed on the walls.  From the windows, the Bellagio pool area can be viewed (through a slight screen of greenery).  There is a media charging bar with less obstructed window viewd, as well as an outdoor walkway / balcony seating area."}
{"text":"Worst  espresso ever will never go back there !!! The espresso comes out like black sanka and thats what they call and serve as an espresso!!!!!!!!!! Disgusting!!!!!!!! Espresso is suppose to be hot thick creamy crema on top !! Dont know how they even stay open !!! Do Not Go maybe they should go to cafes around the world and learn before they open up an Italian cafe"}
{"text":"Located in Belagio towards the pools and conference rooms. The European bakery serves breakfast and lunch. 

This cafe offers are large variety of sweet and savory cafe choices, juice, and European coffee, Quiche, Croissant, Brioche, bagels, coffee, lattes, and mochas. 

Third visit to Paleo. Remodeled from our first trip. Between the visits to dates we have tried the Brioche, Quiche Loraine, Dolce de Leche Croissant, Chocolate Croissant, Spanish Mocha, Coffee and Latte. 

The brioche with ham or bacon, egg, and butter was a good breakfast item. Brioche is like a savory muffin. Light, soft, and tender were the brioches. Delicious. The bacon was the better of choices. 

Similar to the brioche was the quiche which comes in vegetable or ham Loraine. We ordered Quiche Loraine. It was a little heavier than the brioche but not lost in the flavor. Meat was a bit salty but not bad. Soft in hold. Not bad at all. 

The croissants were buttery light and  flaky. Sweet were the dolce de Leche and chocolate. Not too sweet but a fair balance of the filling to pastry. Scrumptious and so good. Could eat ten of any of these and not feel guilty. 

Tried the coffee, lattes, and the Spanish mocha. Made European style. Fresh and bold. Definitely eye opener or a good day starter. No shortage of energy after drinking these. Best drink was the Spanish mocha. Probably one of the best coffee or espresso drinks I have ever had. The Spanish mocha was sweet, balanced, fresh and hot. 

This place gets busy and the line moves quickly. A little pricey for menu but competitive with other cafés and coffee bistros in the area. Staff is friendly and generally efficient. Generally stocked pastry case. Seating can get full inside or out at the patio area outside which was a nice added area in the last year. 

Overall this is one of the best breakfasts spots I have found in Las Vegas. Menu items are rightly portioned, balanced flavors, and outrageously delicious. 

Five stars for the flavor and service experienced thus far. Can't lower a rating if seating gets full. People want to relax sometimes and this is a good place to do so. Keep up the work. I will be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Looking for some huge croissants?  This place has it.  Big desserts and coffee with an even bigger price tag at this joint.  But hey, we're at the Bellagio where prices are expected to be high.  Palio is located across from the Gallery of Fine Arts.  Inside, you'll find a well decorated, spacious, and even a semi-quiet cafe.  Palio has your coffee's, latte's, iced coffee's, desserts, bagels, muffins, cookies, sandwiches, croissants, and even some pre-made sushi.  All are priced to profit and people buy it. 

I admit, I am not the biggest fan of Palio with the main reason being price.  The cheapest item on their menu is their basic Americano for $4.50.  Think about it.  Starbucks carries this for $2 and we all know they are priced high too.  But when you have that 2:30 feeling, you do what you got to do.  

Service is just okay and if they were above and beyond, I'd probably up the stars to 4.  As of now, just 3 stars meaning Palio is just okay."}
{"text":"Clean, bright, fast, tasty food. Better prices than the other restaurants at the Bellagio. I had the berry bowl. The fruit was fresh and sweet. The blue berries were some of the largest I have seen. We had the tuna sandwich and Italian classic sandwich. My tuna sandwich was enough for me to keep half for lunch. My significant other was filled up by this full sandwich. The bread was very tasty. Perfectly soft on the inside and lightly crunchy on the outside. The chocolate croissant was delicious. I enjoyed that the potion of chocolate was substantial. They serve breakfast lunch and dinner. Plenty of seating in you include the patio and hallway. The hallway makes a nice area to people watch."}
{"text":"Beware 2 spiked coffee drinks and one choc chip cookie are $40. The spiked coffee is definitely worth it- just not the cookie."}
{"text":"Awesome little Java joint. The line gets pretty long in the morning, typically stretching all the way out in to the shops corridor. And it moves pretty slow so be forewarned.

Located adjacent to the pool area, with outdoor seating that overlooks the pool area as well.

Nice selection of brews, (er, coffee, but they do sell beer as well), breakfast pastries, fruits, salads, etc. Pretty much like your neighborhood Starbucks but with a slightly lower price tag."}
{"text":"Quickie cafe type place in the Bellagio. Prices are pretty ridiculous, quality of the food is subpar, and the service is lackluster. I got a salad which was prepackaged and a side of bread which was pretty stale. The menu is super small and the selection is really limited. The only good thing about this place was the ice water with free refills."}
{"text":"Quaint coffee place in the Bellagio.  Somewhere to take a break from the casino crazyness."}
{"text":"I wish hotels had better quick service breakfast places. Everything looked so heavy and was overpriced. I really could not find a low calorie, healthy breakfast selection.  I finally settled on a yogurt parfait (if you call that healthy) and coffee.  Total was $14 - really?  At least the coffee was good."}
{"text":"My happy place in Vegas!!!  Best coffee and pastries, hands down!  My favorite breakfast:  a cup of coffee and quiche lorraine!!!  Fills me up to last me the rest of the day till dinner time!   Even when I don't stay at the Bellagio for my trip, a visit just for Palio is always in order!"}
{"text":"My girl and I had an itch for a cup of joe first thing in the morning and came about finding this cute spot.

We both got the iced mocha coffee, and I usually add cream or milk to my coffee, but once I tried it, I realized that cream or milk would tarnish this delightfully good tasting coffee. We both enjoyed it very much! The place itself is decorated in a cute Irish inspired decor that had me looking at everything from tip to bottom becauae it was so nice. The price was steep at first, but once you go about taking that first sip, the price then becomes irrelevant; not to mention that it's Vegas so everything in terms of price has its inflation. The pastries looked good too; good enough that we decided to come back again tomorrow. 

Overall: good artisan coffee with a beautiful layout with decor. Come in and start your day off the right"}
{"text":"Java slush -- was good, and a light coffee taste, Was hoping for a thicker/denser texture, similar to a  Starbucks frapp, but this had the consistency of a runny slurpee from 7-11. Not bad, but not my personal taste. 

Caprese sandwich - hot (also a cold option). Was delicious! Mostly bread, as expected, but I loved the acidic bite of the tomato, some pesto, a gooey mozzarella cheese! Delicious breakfast. 

Was very busy in here in the morning, always a line, but moved very quickly as they had about 4 workers taking orders at a time. 

Small space, limited seating. Would suggest getting your stuff to go, which most people did. 
In addition to pastries and sandwiches, there were healthy options such as salads, pre-cut mixed fruit containers, juices. 

Good for a quick solid bite."}
{"text":"Skip the sit down breakfast and come here for a delicious latte and an amazing stuffed brioche. The ham and cheese is to die for. I had one every morning and was not disappointed. The Mexican mocha is on the sweet side (for me. I generally like my lattes unsweetened) but delicious and warming."}
{"text":"The original plan was to go to the Bellagio buffet because one of our friends had never been to Vegas before so we wanted to take her to a buffet experience and Bellagio, IMHO has the best.

Of course, it was a late start and when we got there the line was so long and no one wanted to wait. So what could we do? We were starving and walked around -- this was the first place we saw -- so we went in to grab a bite.

It's one of those cafes where you order and they give you your food and you find your own place to sit.

We ordered the chorizo quiche, vegetable quiche -- both were okay, although the chorizo one tasted much better. Texturally both were the same.

The antipasto platter was nice with 3 types of meat, cheese, olives, grilled zucchini and mozzarella balls. 

Salmon platter was also decent with salmon laid onto flatbread and sprinkled with all the condiments you would find at a salmon spread.

Chef's Salad was nice too, I ordered it because I felt we should eat something healthy.

Our entire bill came to approximately $62 which is pricey for a non-service cafe, but this IS the Bellagio and it tasted fine so that's all I care about. It was convenient and there wasn't a hoard of people in there."}
{"text":"Small coffee shop and pastry place near the pool at Bellagio.  We ate here for a quick lunch.  The room is very crowded, if over half of the tables are full, it's difficult to get around without hitting a stranger.  They serve pastries, salads, and preformed sandwiches.  I should have been warned by the fact they are pre-wrapped, but I got the tuna salad.  The bread was thick, but nearing stale.  Also, despite its thickness, it didn't hold the tuna salad well in places.  The salad itself was common mayo based tuna salad.  Good enough.  But, the bread ruined the sandwich for me.  And, chips are $3.50, so that didn't help my mood.

The wife had the Bellagio chicken pie.  This is a hot pie made with veggies in the pie.  It was solid, and it's available elsewhere on the property.  Good, flaky crust and great flavor.  The slice was substantial as well.

If you need something quick on your way to or from the pool, Palio will get the job done.  But, don't expect to be blown away if you are eating a full meal."}
{"text":"I'm mad. Really, really mad!

You see-I have been coming to Palio since it opened. I came here when most guests would eat breakfast in the usual hotel restaurants but I found this hidden gem and have loved everything about it as you can see from my prior review. They have now added outdoor seating and some terrific newer dishes. 

The word is out and now everyone seems to flock here in the mornings. The lines do move but they are longer and seating can be tough during peak times. The food and staff are still top notch and I literally dine here every morning I'm in Vegas.

Now the secret is out, so just leave me alone and let me enjoy my wonderful bold coffee, smoked salmon platter and Nutella croissant.

I'm mad. Really, really mad!"}
{"text":"Why do so many reviews discuss whether or not Palio is overpriced? Because two things are simultaneously true: 1.Its price is at the lower end of cost at the Bellagio; 2.For the quality of what you get, it's some of the most over-inflated food in Vegas.

The food isn't made in the Palio. It's made in a kitchen that distributes to other MGM restaurants. The pastries are good but literally interchangeable with most pastries in the Bellagio because they come from the same kitchen. Sandwiches are below Subway quality, given above Subway prices, and presented with the hopes that you'll be caught up in the Vegas mythos and miss the fact that you just ate fast food that a chef put together hours before you woke up.

The employees are clearly not trained to be baristas. Espresso-based drinks and spiked coffee is some of the worst in the strip for some of the highest prices.

The outside porch has a gorgeous view of the pool. If you bought a croissant, a simple cup of coffee, and sat outside you could have a nice breakfast. Anything beyond that, and you'll wind up seriously disappointed."}
{"text":"Nutella pocket is tha best ever!!!!!!! Caesar kale salad with chicken is great, coffee is good. 
Staff is great!!!!"}
{"text":"Palio in the Bellagio provides pretty good food and coffee though, like most of the rest of Las Vegas, it is overpriced for what you are getting. 

For lunch, we ordered the chicken wrap, albacore tuna sandwich and cobb salad to share. The wrap was pretty dry and needed mustard and salad dressing to make it really tasty. The cobb salad was really fresh and delicious and the balsamic vinaigrette was perfect. The coffee and cappuccino were also super and I always appreciate free coffee refills! The pastry options also looked pretty temping!"}
{"text":"Palio's incredibly flaky Almond Croissant and decent coffee are even better when delivered via \"room service.\"

Triply benefitted by the new autumn display in the Conservatory, free passes to the Painting Women show at the Gallery of Fine Art, and the fact that I was picking up a friend from Columbus for brunch it was with nearly fourteen miles of early morning running already under foot that I entered Palio Café, the recently renovated space never to be confused with the concept of 'paleo-friendly' in any way, shape, or form.  Located across the hall from the aforementioned gallery, in a flag and tile clad space featuring outdoor dining offered for those lustful for fresh air, it was just minutes after the restaurant's 6:00am opening that I entered a small queue and with a plethora of pastries gleaming behind glass a substantial order soon took shape.  Obviously far less famous than celebrity-backed bakeries touting the names of Keller, Payard, Buddy, and Jean-Philippe but no less innovative in its offerings my experience at Palio began with a duo of croissants and although the explosively flaky almond rendition instantly set a new standard for The Strip it was the overstuffed Dulce de Leche version that soon stole the show - each delicate bite through arches of crisp lamination yielding a burst of creamy caramel that my early arrival found still-warm.  Quickly devouring both croissants before scaling back to a \"some for now/some for later\" approach to the rest it was in the doughnut and cinnamon roll that I next partook and although both were nicely made, the former sporting a pleasant looseness to the crumb beneath light notes of citrus, neither were 'must orders' compared to what followed - a toasty gold pocket chock-a-block full of hazelnut spread that I'd strongly advise sitting down to enjoy as a grab-and-go approach is almost assured to end in a trip to the laundry for shirt, pants, or both.  At this point turning to more portable items as I slowly wandered the tourist-free serenity of Sin City's early morning hours it was next in a bearclaw that I indulged and although nicely textured I personally found the results far too sweet, the lacquer of glaze entirely overwhelming  sparse nut filling and thus leaving me to instead focus on a duo of cookies, the Chocolate Chip a textbook rendition with crisp edges surrounding a soft center but the Oatmeal Raisin far better with buttery notes playing off cinnamon and softly set oats as a mountain of golden raisins added just enough sweetness to taste equally breakfast and dessert.

Undoubtedly underrated due to the lack of celebrity signage and a location slightly off the beaten path, suffice it to say that Palio Café is executing on just as high a level as Bouchon, Payard, and even Bellagio's own Jean Philippe.  While some may say that prices are high, at $4.25 the croissants are no more expensive than the inferior versions at other on-strip vendors while other options actually represent a bargain compared to its peers, both here in Las Vegas and across the nation."}
{"text":"Palio had some very high highs and then some mediocres as well. The prices were a bit high, but the coffee was good, so I didn't feel bad about that. The chocolate croissant was boring and very average. The dulce de leche croissant was HUGE and delicious. The caramel was oozing out all over. It was messy and awesome and I would go back just for that. So go here, get the croissant and share it with someone because it is way too big for one person."}
{"text":"I ordered the banana nut muffin from the dessert display case. It wasn't the best but we were able to sit outside while eating our breakfast."}
{"text":"Similar to other Vegas cafés, Palio's food and drinks are overpriced; nonetheless, the decor is definitely one step above the rest of the cafés. I adore the decorations on the walls and ceilings - the colorful British tea plates complement well with the wooden chairs and tables. The drinks selection is limited compared to Starbucks. Neither chai tea nor green tea is available. The mocha is decent, but it is too bitter for me. Palio is a great place to rest and chat for friends. However, Yelpers, please do not have high expectations on the food and drinks."}
{"text":"While walking around the Bellagio Hotel, I came across the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, which lured me into this charming café called Palio.

This little cafe serves fine coffee, cold-pressed juice, salads, fruits, soups, sandwiches and pastries..........kinda like an \"up scale\" Starbucks!

Although on the pricey side..........I must say the coffee they serve here is quite exquisite! 

If you're ever in the area, it's worth the time to stop by for a cup of joe, and have one of them award winning pastries!"}
{"text":"I loved this place.  We had breakfast here one day.  Excellent coffee (illy products) and pastries.  We had a bacon egg and cheese brioche and a mozzarella and tomato platter with a baugette.  Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Sounds Italian but it's actually Irish! That sounds really familiar for some reason...anyways the ham & cheese croissant rocked & the coffee was fantastic!"}
{"text":"The croissants here are top notch. They are flaky, buttery and airy, the way a true croissant should be. This reason alone earned the extra star to a full 4-stars as you do pay dearly for it since your at the Bellagio. If I was on an expense account, I may have given this place a full 5 because the service is solid to but alas, it came out of my pocket. The nutella stuffed pastry thingy though was quite disappointing though. I know... It's nutella but the overall execution of it just wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Average coffee and latte. Also got a scone, cranberry twist and cinnamon roll. Kind of dry. Again just average. Definitely pricier than the Starbucks across the road. Probably not going back"}
{"text":"It was a must that we had to have a coffee this morning so we took a lyft to this spot. I ordered the ice mocha which was pretty darn good. Didn't have to add creamer or sugar it was perfect. I do want to try the pastries next time I come back. The little shop was cozy."}
{"text":"Loved the cookies and cream gelato.....
The scoops were massive.....

of course...overpriced.

however...

yummmmmmyyyyy!!!"}
