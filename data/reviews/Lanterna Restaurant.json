{"text":"This is a classic throwback to another world. Its a tiny restaurant by comparison to many of the more modern places you'll find - only a couple of small rooms - and its not for everyone. The prices are more than you might expect to pay at a seaside restaurant (although still very reasonable) But this is no regular kind of seaside restaurant - a well kept secret which is worth every penny.    Its a rarity for scarborough to have a place which has won awards and been recommended by respected reviewing bodies - Lanterna has been recommended by Which and won the official Italian restaurant of the Year Award. To back this up, testimonials from satisfied customers line the walls.    A family run restaurant, service is friendly and never rushed. The food is magnificent. The wine list is extensive and authentic. The desserts are fantastic. Its not a place to visit as an everday experience, but as a treat, its unmissable.    Remember to book in advance though - its only a small (around 30 seater) restaurant and is only open for a few hours per day."}
{"text":"One word - expensive. Worth it ? Every single penny. I only come here on special occasions (I am not a millionaire!). The food is quite spectacular. I had veal with shaved truffle and I was utterly speechless. My partner had skate and it was the biggest single portion of fish I had ever seen and had been landed that same morning. The wine list is extensive and expensive but what would you expect. I finished the meal with a couple of shots of Grappa as a digestivo. Their Grappa menu has to be seen to be believed. Don't let the six pound a shot price tag put you off as you have probably just spent 150 on the meal for two. Simply awesome in the true sense of the word."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Scarborough! It's small, friendly and very high quality.    OK, it's expensive, but well worth every penny. The fresh fish is always superb, it's bought locally so there is never any guarantee that a certain sort will be available, but I've had turbot and sea bass on several occasions, and they are served on the bone and cooked to perfection (the sea bass in particular has a nice crispy skin).    Also recommended is the venison ravioli, either as a starter or a main course. I've had both - and it is fantastic! There are delicate shavings of fresh parmesan on top of very fine pasta and a beautiful meaty sauce and it smells divine.    Another good point is the fact that veal is available - in escalopes, in sauce and very ocasionally as chops (very good) which, when we had them, were topped with wild mushrooms.    There is nothing to fault this fantastic eaterie."}
