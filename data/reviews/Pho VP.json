{"text":"I've eaten plenty of downtown Pho and I really enjoy the unique flavor of their broth. I would also recommend trying the Pad Thai and the stew beef with rice noodles if you're in the mood to try something other than Pho, and so far I've been happy with anything they've recommended. The food is great and the service is outstanding, the mother and son team are very accommodating and will do their best to customize your order to satisfy picky eaters and children. They have no delivery or website but it's definitely worth the effort of going there to eat in or pick up. I'm so happy they're in the neighborhood; I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood restaurant. The owners are super friendly and offer suggestions if you are not sure what you want.  The pho is flavourful and reasonably priced. The spring rolls are tasty. They do a family style hot pot on the weekends if you call ahead. I don't think I've ever had a nicer experience with owners of a restaurant. They are warm and inviting and make you feel comfortable. It really is a rarity to leave a restaurant feeling like you are appreciated and will be remembered the next time you come in. Give this place a shot if you are looking for good food in a comfortable setting with warm hosts."}
{"text":"The owner here is one of the reasons we go. The service is really great and he is incredibly friendly. The food is pretty good as well. I generally get the rare beef pho and  I highly recommend selection \"B4\" on the menu which is noodles with beef wrapped in basil leaves I believe.  The down side is that the menu is not available on the site which can make it difficult to order if you want to switch it up.  Overall my husband and I order from here often when we really don't feel like cooking for the night.  On cold days Pho always seems like the perfect choice!"}
{"text":"Friendly owner and super helpful helping people choose vegetarian options.  The place is very clean with comforting decor.  The food was fresh and tasteful.  I will be returning."}
{"text":"Nice decor and a really friendly waiter.  We had the beef stew noodle soup and it was spicy and delicious.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Solid spot for pho. Owner is very friendly, gracious, accommodating. Broth is always fresh and fragrant. Has become a weekly takeout for us."}
{"text":"A great neighbourhood place! The owner is so nice and friendly. He remembers you and customizes your favourite dishes as you like it. Simple and good quality. The chicken pho is soothing and comforting. The vermicelli noodle dish is fresh and fills you up."}
{"text":"I created a Yelp account just for this place. The fried spring rolls are amazing and the stew is spicy and comforting in the winter. Grilled pork and chicken are family favourites. Love this spot. It appears a mother and son team and the cooking is done by mom. They are very  accommodating and ensure people feel welcome. A place I can take the family and still get a nice spicy dish. Did I say I love this spot!!"}
{"text":"Pho VP has been a great addition to the neighbourhood of Jane and Annette which is experiencing a little bit of a renaissance for restaurants.  It's a family owned Vietnamese restaurant that hits the spot if you're in the neighbourhood. We've been multiple times for lunch and dinner and the owner is always courteous and helpful. The fact that I'm a 5 minute walk away DOES NOT HURT!  Decor is modern and clean and very comfortable. They recently added alcohol to their menu as well and a Hot Pot (I believe it requires pre-ordering)  I've ordered multiple things but for me the benchmark of Vietnamese cuisine is the Pho Dac Biet (Pho Special, with all the fun bits of meat) and they have a solid offering. Only reason for not giving them 5 stars is that I wouldn't say this place is destination dining in any way but it's a great place to have in the neighbourhood and I wish them all the best."}
{"text":"Really very good. Have been once for sit-down dinner - had a delicious beef noodle soup.  Twice had takeout - Vietnamese sandwich (pork), was very fresh. Second time had fresh shrimp rolls  and mint beef (with salad and spring rolls).  Everything was super fresh and delicious.  The portions are good. The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated and the owners are very, very friendly and attentive.  They accept debit (over $10), and credit (over $20). I plan to be a regular....."}
{"text":"Clean place . Excellent customer service . Very good price and food is also good. You should try their house special . Their pad Thai is famous and it's gluten free"}
{"text":"Went twice. Pho wasn't bad but portion sizes were small compared to other Pho restaurants. Also, they missed out a number of advertised ingredients. Not my favourite Pho place"}
{"text":"It's the only Vietnamese place in the neighbourhood.  I'd rather drive to the place on Pacific & Dundas though.  Mango salad was ok, and the noodles didn't taste freshly made, rather cooked from dried.  The broth was not as fragrant either.  I'd only go back if I weren't up for driving out and wanted some pho."}
{"text":"The soup is really fresh, my girlfriend said it was one of the top 5 pho soup she had ever had. the owner was able to verify that the soup was gluten free; the salad rolls that we ordered were crunchy, fresh and delicious. the restaurant is really clean and the owner is a really nice guy, highly recommended"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. We've requested to customize our order and they actually they suggested is the customization of our food!!"}
{"text":"Great service, good pho.   I only wish they had more options of meat to go in the pho (tripe, tendon etc)"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have never written a review.  This is a nice quiet place.  Family run I believe.  The owner is friendly and has great suggestions.  I asked for spicy and he delivered!  I lower in stars as the lack of music is eerie.  It needs a bit of ambience.  And a touch up on some paint and such. Cot heresies food is great and the staff experience is as well."}
{"text":"Not a fan.. the pho broth was decent, but! when we're ordering a pho tai (with rare beef) we're kind of expecting rare beef, not rare beef that has been precooked in the soup and then served. Plus more beef please. The prices are higher than most places downtown. Also if the server could not play their music videos on their speaker phones while we're dining, that would be appreciated. You know that feeling when someone wants to show you a youtube video? No on wants to hear other peoples junk on speaker phone while they are trying dine, just stop or do it in your own privacy."}
{"text":"Delicious Pho! Broth is amazing and service is so friendly. I recommend This restaurant and cannot wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"5 minutes from our door, a good option for our Vietnamese fix. I'll be honest, I've really only had the chargrilled pork bun (vermicelli noodle) but it's good enough to have ordered at least a dozen times. The noodles are thicker than I'm accustomed to in the dish, but the flavour is there AND it's five minutes from my door."}
{"text":"Not the best pho you'll find in the city, but it's still good and you won't leave disappointed. Amazing and friendly staff. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"More like 3.5*. Maybe I just don't like Vietnamese food...   First, I'll say that the owner was super friendly and helpful. Which seems to be a common theme among these reviews! The place itself is also very tastefully decorated. The tall ceilings are beautiful and the owner told us they found that beautiful pattern accidentally as the last owners had lowered the ceilings and covered it up? Who would do that?  The food itself was kind of meh. Either didn't have much taste or tasted weird. I generally like most kinds of foods so this was disappointing. This was my first time having Vietnamese food so perhaps I just need to try a different dish. I may be back as the location is close and the prices not bad."}
{"text":"This place was very average... we had several dishes since we were 4 adults, 4 kids. Pad Thai was very different than the ones I had before...service was fast, place and washrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Travelled the distance because of the rating and was sorely disappointed. Selection was limited and pho had NO flavor. They were also cheap on the veggies and the egg rolls were undercooked- pork was still pink! Also there was no difference for large vs small only the price. Don't bother or you'll walk away with a pricey bill and sad face."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were just in the area so we decided to go here for lunch before hitting up High Park.  The interior hasn't change since I was here last about over a year ago.  The gentleman who owns the restaurant was friendly and welcoming as always. Surprisingly he still remembered me. The female staff was very aggressive, impatient and demanding, totally did not like it all. It's usually just these two working.  The food was delicious as always but we both noticed a price hike in the food. It went about two dollars for every dish on the menu. We found it a little overpriced compared to other local restaurants in the area. My boyfriend ordered a small pho, which came up to $10 and I ordered the Banh Xeo which is $8. There was also a coke but we have no idea how much that came to... but the total bill with tip came up to $28...   We both decided since the place is fairly overpriced, we will not be coming back here unfortunately."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the hood. Place is super clean (as in probably the cleanest Asian resto I've ever set foot in!) and tastefully decorated. Staff perfectly pleasant and helpful. I'm no Pho expert but I thought the food was very tasty. The thing about this type of resto is that they provide the condiments at your table so you can season you food as you like - hot sauce, hoisin, etc. so take advantage of that, but don't complain if food is not flavourful. That would be like eating an undressed hotdog and saying it was boring!   There was a limited selection of beer and wine - all fine, only they seemed to be missing Asian beer.  Anyhow, try this place! You won't be disappointed! I'll be back! :)  To the owners - Get out there! Start a Facebook and Twitter page, put a deal on Groupon or something, get a website! You can be successful but you have to get the word out! Good luck!"}
{"text":"Very fast,  friendly and we'll priced.   Have been here twice now for take out. The staff are extremely friendly.  Had the spring rolls and rare beef pho.  Well definitely be back"}
{"text":"An excellent addition to the neighborhood. The pho broth is rich, flavorful and not too salty. Noodle bowl is fairly generous with the meat and fresh herbs.   Service was excellent, and the place was spotless. A little bit expensive, but not surprising for the area. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The staff here are very nice.  And that's why they get three stars.  Also - because I might be back.  It's possible.    The food isn't the best, the noodles are a let down, and the strange shows they have on tv, way too loud, take away from the experience.  But this is really one of those times where the staff make all the difference.  If they weren't so amazing, this could easily have been a one star review.  That being said, I'm willing to accept I might have been on an off day, and I shall return to see the wonders and glory that awaits.  Or perhaps I'll be disappointed again?  Either way, there will be good people taking my order and brightening my day."}
{"text":"Yummy delicate pho (I had the vegetarian version) with freshly cooked tofu and perfect crisp tender veggies. The shrimp in the fresh rolls was also fresh. The owners are sweet people (I think mother and son) and the restaurant is clean and has a lovely old ceiling with sparkly chandeliers. A great neighbourhood restaurant, I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Fantastic addition to the neighbourhood. Best Vietnamese in the area, everything is always fresh and thoughtful, and the dishes (especially vegetarian) are way more interesting than what's usually done. Crazy friendly family, too. No delivery, but we think it's well worth the walk."}
{"text":"worst vietnamese food i've ever eaten.    no website. no delivery. no digital menu available.  owner politely asked if we could drive over to look at the menu.  how i didn't take these things as the signs they quite obviously were, i don't know.    the vermicelli was...not vermicelli.  it was regular spaghetti.  vermicelli dishes generally come with some cold veg (lettuce, sprouts, carrots, etc.).  this one did not.  this light dish left behind a thick, oily residue in the bottom of the takeout container.  the cold rolls:  had three ingredients:    1. plain lettuce 2. plain spaghetti 3. plain shrimp  no spice, no seasoning, nothing.  in a word: disgraceful.  the cold roll sauce was congealed and just not the sauce that comes with cold rolls.  the pho:  *broth had a strange un-pho-like sweet, cinnamon-y taste *very stingy with the fresh basil *very stingy with the hoisin & hot sauces (the little 2 oz. ramekin was less than half full) *no lime   the only reasons i didn't give this a \"1\" star rating:  1. the guy at the resto was nice 2. the takeout containers were well packed and didn't spill or leak 3. the veg was fresh  shame.  new place, nice peeps, no marketing, no menu, no delivery, situated in a deep-pocket neighbourhood.  get it together, pho vp, lest you wind up amongst the many other bankrupt joints in the takeout graveyard."}
{"text":"Located on Jane north of Bloor West, a little Pho shop; price is good, owner is nice but the broth can use some more tweaking.  Came here around 12.30pm on a Thursday, few other tables occupied but otherwise not too busy.    Ordered rare beef pho and it was an average bowl, nothing outstanding.  A quick fix to calm that craving"}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up. Food was ready really fast (10 minutes) and was hot on pick up. Restaurant was clean, and service was friendly.  Unfortunately, the food left a lot to be desired. We had one order of spring rolls, one vermicelli with BBQ pork & spring roll, and a rare beef pho (large).  The spring rolls were filled with minced pork, and were really soggy (which sometimes happens with pick up). They were really oily too.   The \"BBQ pork\" in the vermicelli dish wasn't BBQ'd and was full of gristle. Not much flavour. This dish came with a TON of lettuce that was very roughly chopped (ie huge pieces) and some pickled carrot. Edible, but very americanized in terms of flavour and presentation. The rare beef pho was the most disappointing dish. Portion size was quite small compared to other Vietnamese restaurants around (1 sprig of basil, no sprouts, no lime) and the broth tasted like it came from a can.  Really disappointed in this experience and will not be back."}
{"text":"I cam here first when it opened last year, and found it was kind of disappointing.  I ordered my usual Pho Dac Biet - and the noodles were slightly stale tasting and the beef was overcooked.    As Mike B mentioned, the only saving grace for this place was that the staff were SUPER nice.  I'm hoping that by now they have worked out the new-restaurant kinks!  I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"I went here with my friends and I really enjoyed my meal. Excellent food, very yummy spring rolls, and fast service."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, vegie pad thai too salty, spring rolls were great. Pho was ok. Would go back."}
