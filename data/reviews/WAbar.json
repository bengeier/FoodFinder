{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here based on a blogto review dating back to November 2013 saying it was a \"hidden gem\" where alcohol is available by the bottle and there's food too.  As we've been looking for a good place to accommodate a large group for a birthday party on a saturday night, we were looking forward to trying out a place that was not well known yet.  We were there early on a friday night at around 5:30 pm so we could try the food and just see what the place looked like. 

Unfortunately, the place looked like a hole in the wall, but not in a good way. I'd like to say that it's just because they're going through renovations, but it seemed like only the washrooms were, even though the whole place looked like it needed a renovation makeover. We were surprised as the blogto review was from 3 months ago. 

Also, unfortunately, the food was bad. We tried 2 of the japadogs and they tasted like bad street meat with toppings that didn't go well together. We also tried the kimchi fries, which had cold kimchi on top of warm fries, that didn't taste or feel good in your mouth. After having tried Banh mi Boys and knowing that they're just a few blocks south, it was difficult not to compare the difference.

With that sad, the server was extremely nice and friendly and removed one of the food items from our bill. We hope she did not take offence to our dislike of the place.  They did have a happy hour of $4 rail drinks when we were there so it may attract those wanting to have cheap drinks after work or a student crowd.

We really wanted to like this place, but we're now on the lookout for another restaurant/bar to celebrate this birthday."}
{"text":"Open till late for drinks and snacks. Has typical Korean menu combo (1 entree + 4 beers or 1 soju). They have 2 floors plus open patio outside at the back of the restaurant. All tables inside or out are very closed together, this place is always packed. The stairs to upper floor is quite narrow. (Better not go up or down if you're drunk!) 

Outside patio has a closed up net with gas heaters. Maybe its All closed up.. The gas smell gave me a headache at first, but after awhile I adjusted to it. (Yet its not quite safe and definitely not healthy) once a while.. I guess its ok, at least it's better than going upatairs for me. 

We sat outdoor so we walked in to order because there was no server for quite some time. After order, their service was quick. Water and beer came almost immediately. Good was on point. I am used to getting the spicy snails. Sounds gross but when you're drunk anything taste good right? It is basically boiled escargots with Korean white noodle and there's coleslaw with spicy sauce in the middle for you to mix. Wasn't the best food but tasted original from Korea."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night at 1AM, with a last call of 2AM with a large group of 15+.

WAbar is small, but has a fun atmosphere. It has a jitz table and a beer pong table, with booth seating towards the front of the bar. There was a DJ at the time playing EDMish music too. Bartender was also super chill, and I had a pretty nice end to my night!

If you check into Yelp and rate you get a free shot off their bar rail with the purchase of a drink :)"}
{"text":"Daily deals, cheap drinks and free beer pong! You also have control of the music. I wouldn't recommend coming here for dinner, but this place is an awesome spot for groups to have a drink. The games make it great for you to get to know new people in your group. Great service and a chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Lots of drinks special, $20 for 4 jagerbombs! They seem to have drink specials everyday. Plus if you check in on Yelp you get a free shot! Although the waitress wasn't very attentive, Myles the guy who worked behind the bar came to take our order and did deliver great service."}
{"text":"I like this little place. I came in after wandering up and down Yonge looking for a place to drink on a boring Wed. evening. Most pubs and bars are dives filled with older people. 

When I walked by this place and saw that it was more like a bar you'd see in East Asia and there was a cute Asian (Viet) bartender, I decided to stop in. I didn't regret it. Plenty of big TVs to watch sports and that cute bartender was very pleasant to talk with. If I'm ever in Toronto again, I'll stop by and try some food. 

Its not actually a Korean bar (anymore), and it has no affiliation with the Wa bar chain in Korea."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday party. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. The service was good. Granted it was a great night and we got smashed, but that's what you want from a bar right? 

Things were affordable and the place was not too crowded. It's small but cozy. There's something for everyone in an efficient little space. 

Booths for drinking. A bar. Beer pong table. Dance floor. And a foosball table. .... I lost my hat tho, so ill go back for a round two to look for it!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for a drink, and everything was really expensive. Specially for the area. My friend and I each got a jaggerbomb and they were about $8 each. Such a waste of money. You are way better off going 2 short blocks south to The Urban House Cafe where all the shots are under $4 and pints are under $5."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a small friendly bar that seriously throws down a mean party!?

Only ever been on Thursdays,  Fridays, and Saturdays. \"Ones and Twos Entertainment\" spin a mean set here Thursdays, I'm not sure who DJs the rest of the weekend. There are food and drink deals every day of the week if I'm not mistaken. 

Party, DJs, beer pong, foosball, deals.... what the hell else do you want from a bar?"}
{"text":"Four stars for: Sports on TV and Cheap Drinks.  You can not go wrong with:
$5 bar rails / $20 for four jagerbombs / $5 beers (tall can) and on game night: Pitcher of Sapporo and Wings for $25!

Really really small place but simple.
Wifi Pw: ILOVEWABAR
Charging station on the wall just next to the bar that's free.

Kimchi fries and Wings (Chinese style, deep fried, salt and pepper) was perfect for someone that was starving and love greasy foods.  Not really a dinner place but there's greasy food for cold winter nights or drunken nights in general.

Foosball table, beer pong/flip cup table and SNES games for some fun.

Servers are really nice.

Was an interesting spot"}
{"text":"This is one of those places you'd go for last minute plans when you're downtown. I came here a couple times to grab a few drinks with some friends. It's a nice little place with a very welcoming atmosphere. It's a nice place to have a get-together, catch up over a drink... pitcher or two with a couple of friends. They have dice if you wanna play that asian dice game. Pretty cool that they have Super Nintendo running at the back of the bar. Ahhh... so nostalgic just watching the guys play Mario Kart, haha. Besides from this interesting aspect, they always have a DJ spinning at the back of the bar and oh! They have a foosball table at the back too if you're into that. It's quite an accommodating and entertaining place to be! However, as the night progresses, it does get pretty crowded. It's best to go around 9-10pm since this place is still roomy until it hits 11pm... well, that's if you do mind the crowd like me...

They have quite a few specials as well... unfortunately, I do not remember the exact days these specials are offered on. But! on one of the the nights (I believe it's a Friday, please correct me if I'm wrong fellow yelpers) it's a glass of free champagne for the ladies. 

Nonetheless, good crowd, good vibe, good music, reasonable drinks, so check this place out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously awful. Took forever for the server to notice I was here and wanting to order. She was too busy socializing with her friends and standing outside while her and her friends smoked weed. Asked her for water at some point, got it an hour later. The food was mediocre, a McDonald's small size amount of fries with a splash of kimchi and three pieces of beef for six bucks...? Kept ignoring us or forgetting us. Awful."}
{"text":"This place was O-K. I came here once with a few friends after seeing that Ehwa Bar across the street was full - not sure if I'll want to come back here.

Things that I liked: 
- Beer pong table
- There are games available (i.e. dice)
- There's WiFi
- Apparently you can book this place for events
- There's a DJ

Things that I did not like:
- There was not a lot of space in here
- DJ was really close to the beer pong table area and was in the way sometimes
- It was quite dark in here
- Some of the menu items written on the boards/walls were difficult to read
- When I was here, there was only 1 bartender

Overall, I feel like this place is somewhere you go when your other choices of places to go are not available. I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall bar with free SNES arcade games and a beer pong table. Some nights you see some epic games but most of the times it's a couple friends playing for drinks. There is a DJ that takes requests which is awesome. $5 for Jaeger bombs. Oh and check in for free drinks. Not the best place for a long stay but a great way to end a night or start one."}
