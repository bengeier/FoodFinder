{"text":"Verdun's new ice cream joint is everything you need and more.

Besides the fact that they have a fantastic soft serve ice cream they have a actually menu filled with greasy goodness.

The place has a lot of sitting inside and a little Terrasse in the front.

They have about 8 different chocolates to dip and the best I've had are milk and salted caramel. The
Place close at 11 the kitchen earlier as everything was sold out when we came for 10.

Great little spot and clean with so much to offer."}
{"text":"Getting charged $2.00 for a Lester's vapour (improperly dressed) and 8.50 for a 'large'  poutine that's flavour was akin to packing tape really took the charm out of what was a really great day.  People seem to be enjoying the ice cream. Ill go back to try that but stay away from the fast food."}
{"text":"Bel exemple de tappe-à-l'oeil... Ils ont mis le paquet côté rénos et déco, logo et vêtements... Alors j'étais vraiment excitée! Mais rien de spécial au menu! Le staff n'est pas très sympathique (mais merci à celui qui nous a donné des frites en extra, j'imagine pour l'attente ou parce qu'il a bien vu comment l'autre nous a servie (?!)), j'ai rarement vu une cassière aussi bête et inarticulée. Quand l'ambiance ne \"matche\" pas le genre de personnes qui y sont employé(e)s ça ne sert pas à grand chose. Entre vous et moi, c'est un casse-croûte bien normal, alors tant qu'à payer plus cher parce que c'est beau... On ne mange pas souvent de malbouffe alors pour le peu de fois qu'on y va, la prochaine fois on retournera à nos classiques à la place!!"}
{"text":"On a quick afternoon return visit - it was hot and warm out - therefore time to try some Gelato. I was informed you can blend up to 3 flavours in one cup (3.50 plus taxes).

The clerk combined a trifecta of butter pecan, with mocha and maple (the two later soy based) into a green semi-translucent plastic bowl. Coming with a monogrammed \"Les Crèmeries Dairy King\" chocolate square and half a round chocolate cookie wafer.

Note: the banana Gelato is yellow so not full on Italian authentic, but don't get me wrong, it's still nice to have Gelato on offer. 

Now for the update as promised for the their namesake the Hot Dog. The steamed option for 1.50 was in a Lester's wrapper, so that's that, but it had more and a better than average coleslaw. 

They also have a toasted and Michigan option for 2.00 and 2.50 respectively, and good to know they now accept debit to pay.

On another sunny aft it was pretty hoppin', so looks like word's getting around, \"build a gorgeous space and they will come.\""}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty good -- not going to win any awards but quite satisfying. Have not tried the hot dogs nor the fries (the poutine seemed kind of pricey). The ambiance is nice and the place is very clean. It's above average for what it is."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place, I've walked by it tons of times but finally had time and the appetite to walk in and order some food. My partner and I ordered pogos, fries, hot dogs and a poutine. The portions were huge, and everything tasted pretty good. A bit pricy considering you can get the same exact hot dogs from belle pro but we enjoyed our meal quite a bit !"}
