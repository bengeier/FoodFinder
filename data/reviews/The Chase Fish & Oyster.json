{"text":"Great restaurant - on the 5th floor and outside or inside are both nice depending on the experience you are looking for (inside is more formal).  We ordered the halibut for two.  They bring out the fish whole first to show you want you are about to eat- it is a very nice presentation.  The halibut was some of the best I have ever had.  Good cocktails as well.  We did not order dessert.  They offer a gluten free version of their famous bread."}
{"text":"Fantastic and not to be missed. 

The duck confit is one of the best, if not the best I've ever had. If you're daring and up to the challenge, the roasted chicken with foie gras makes for a fabulous dinner option. The staff and service couldn't have been better. Hopefully The Chase will bring back upscale dining to Toronto and we can do away with the over-crowded 'tapas/come-hipster\" dive bars that have been masquerading as hot-spots.

Congratulations Steven and Michael, job well done!"}
{"text":"The Chase has been open for about 6 months! Positioned right at the corner of Temperance and Yonge, The Chase occupies two floors of the 100+ year old heritage Dineen building. The bottom floor is the Chase Fish & Oyster, a casual nautical-themed setting that offers fresh seafood but also offers some of the BEST FRIED CHICKEN ever. A breast and drumstick bathed in crunchy batter is served with magical sauce (hot sauce butter) - what we all dreamed Toonie Tuesday should be.

The raw Albacore Tuna was a bit too lemon-y for my tastes but still, great for those who don't mind. As for dessert, the chocolate sundae was to die for, and I'm not a fan of sundaes.

Overall, a pleasing 4 stars - service was pleasant, food was amazing, and all during a nice quiet lunch.

As a side note: The Chase (sans Fish & Oyster) basically built an additional floor atop the building and transformed it into a upscale glass penthouse, tastefully decorated with a patio, bar and eloquent dining area."}
{"text":"I visited The Chase in the summer of 2014 after hearing rave reviews from friends. I came here with work and we were a group of 8. I can thoroughly say this restaurant lives up to the hype. 

Service & Atmosphere - the first thing you notice when you walk out of the elevator and into the main dining room is the décor. The interior is extremely posh and well decorated (though may be overboard for some) and has somewhat of a decent view of the city. The next thing that we noticed as a group was the excellent service. Besides the regular filling of water/wine and explanation of the menu, the restaurant was extremely accommodating with two members of our group who were rather late. It was obvious they rushed the appetizers out for those two - as we already started eating while waiting - so that the entrees for the whole table would arrive at the same time. 

Food - very good. I think across the board the appetizers were fantastic with the Avocado and Tuna standing out. For the entrée, I had the stuffed fois gras chicken which was unfortunately a little dry (though this may have been because it was waiting under the heater for the entrées of the two late guests in our party) and I found it a bit too salty. Nonetheless it was still flavourful and quite enjoyable. If you're picky about portion size, I would take a look at the pictures people have posted and look at what to expect as they do vary a bit. The dish that stole the show for me was the \"Lime\" dessert. This deconstructed key lime pie made into an angel cake topped with shaved coconut and marshmallow icing that create contrasting textures and flavours is a stroke of genius. If there is any dessert I would keep going back to, it would be this one (yes, even over Scaramouche's coconut cream pie). 

Price - while their prices are in line with other fine dining establishments in the city, the menu does make you wonder whether you really want to pay $75 for a chicken when you could get a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket for around $10 (of course you can't quite compare as they're nowhere near equal in terms of quality and taste, but I'm mentioning this to illustrate the prices). My recommendation: if there are certain appetizers or desserts that you like, visit The Chase Fish & Oyster downstairs which shares some similar menu items for cheaper. 

In short... come to The Chase if you want to impress, but prepare your wallet for a beating though it will be worth it in the end.

Food - 9/10
Service - 10/10
Atmosphere - 9/10
Value - 8/10
Overall - 9/10 - rounded up to 5 stars"}
{"text":"So over priced for what you get. Portions are small and average tasting. Yet another over hyped downtown Toronto restaurant. The decor and patio are beautiful so save yourself some money and just go for a glass of wine after work."}
{"text":"Have been twice now. My new favourite restaurant for ultra fresh and perfectly cooked seafood in Toronto.  Great wine selection by glass, half or full bottle. Beautiful oysters. Halibut for 2 was done to flaky, white perfection with a tasty crust. Black cod is delicious in a rich, salty broth atop sauteed kale. The grilled octopus with chorizo was full of smoky flavour and just the right balance of tenderness and bite.  The Pearl Platter was great for sharing.
The dining room sparkles with mirrors and glass to create an elegant, upscale ambiance, but is balanced with wood, comfy banquettes and upholstered chairs to create a relaxed feeling.
Dress casually but smartly. Lots of business attire is seen as well, due to location off Bay Street. Highly recommended.  Tip: Park at City Hall for $6 all evening flat rate and walk just a bit south on Bay to Temperance."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful. Everything from ambiance to service to food - a great mix of elegance without being overly upscale/\"stuffy.\"  The short ribs as a starter are great as a comfort food appetizer. We also had the lamb and veal as our meals; both were great!!"}
{"text":"Went for an anniversary dinner. Food was DELICIOUS, decor was cozy but trendy. Our server was efficient although a bit impersonal. Overall though, the lobster was to die for, the clam chowder with lots of personality and the beef tartar was great too. The chocolate cake was a bit blah but everything else was fantastic! Would definitively recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I had the halibut and it was a little buttery but it just melts in your mouth... My friends had the sea bream and cornish hen and both dishes were better. For dessert, we ordered the lime and the chocolate. Our waitress kindly added the strawberry and sorbet on the house as well as added congratulations to our platter. It will probably be best to make reservations ahead of time and let them know if it's for a celebration.

Hope this helps!

{"text":"The best restaurant experience in Toronto! Upon our arrival there was a bit of a commotion due to a fire in the surrounding plaza that rendered the elevators up to the main restaurant closed. Despite this, the staff at The Chase went above and beyond making sure my partner and I were taken care of and not even minutely disappointed with the situation.

Fast forward to finally being seated (at one of the best tables in the house) - our meal was stellar from start to finish, the service was impeccable from both our server, sommelier and the wonderful maitre d' who periodically stopped by to make sure we were consistently happy and satisfied. 

I started with the Octopus, which was truly sent from heaven while my partner got the Avocado which was also just exquisite. For our entrees, we got the Beef and Veal - both of which were perfectly prepared, the beef had a sharp bite in its taste which I really enjoyed. Served with sides of frites and delicious bacon crumble Brussels sprouts. 

We also started with perfectly crafted cocktails, followed by a commendable bottle of wine and cognac as an aperitif. Wonderful dining experience, I would go back in a heartbeat! 

Thank you to The Chase for making my anniversary dinner an unforgettable one!"}
{"text":"When will Toronto restauranteurs learn about service? A myriad of awkward 20-somethings in tight dresses standing in groups behind a podium or tripping around aimlessly on too high heels with an iPad in tow does not constitute restaurant management or even good hosting. Notified in advance when we made our reservation that we were celebrating an important event, we had asked the restaurant for a special table. When we arrived, we were seated where there should never have been a table - directly in front of the washrooms. When we asked to be moved, we were forced to stand at the overcrowded bar for an hour. There, an inept and rude bartender served us the wrong drinks for which they did not comp us. When our table was finally ready, we were kept waiting another 45 minutes between our first course and our entrees. 3 and a half hours later, I asked my family if we could skip dessert and go home. The food at Chase was uninspired but good enough, I guess. Having recently returned from 5 days in Sonoma where we ate far better food, at much less expensive but equally high end restaurants AND enjoyed consistently fabulous service, I'd suggest that Chase isn't worth your time, patience or your money. There are plenty of better places to go in this city."}
{"text":"Found this gem after walking to another restaurant around the corner that was closed. Nice location, although the porta potty across the street was a definite turn off to sit outside. Not very busy on arrival however it soon picked up at the end of business day for local offices. Oysters to start were amazing and set us in good steed to continue. Shrimp and grits for main course was great with the poached egg a top addition. The only groan for me was how small the shrimp were, there needed to be a few more and/or larger. But all in all a great late lunch experience, banana cheesecake topped it off nicely"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been visiting Toronto and wanted a nice meal sans kids within walking distance of the Trump.  After reading the solid yelp reviews, we decided on the Chase downstairs, more casual option.  SCORE!

We ordered oysters, from four locations, as a starter.  Perfect.  My wife asked for a cider, and when they didn't have anything that fit what she was hoping for, they comped her a drink (out of the blue).

We ordered the scallops with ham hocks and herb vinaigrette, the fried chicken with a terrific and inventive slaw, and broccoli with anchovy and chili.  Every dish had a unique twist and were terrific.

My wife also had the chocolate cream pie for dessert.  Another winner.

Relaxed ambience which was exactly what we were looking for.  To top it off, our server, Sara, could not have been any nicer or more helpful.

Food - great
Service - great
Setting - great

Wish we had an excuse to be in Toronto more often just to come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to the The Chase (downstairs) for a work function and it was amazing.  We essentially had the waiter and the kitchen order for us and the 6 of us shared all of the plates.  The food choices were excellent and the staff were very attentive (but not overbearing).  It was a work lunch so I don't know what the final bill was, but I'm sure it was high!!!  Great place overall, and the food was so good that I would go back there despite the high prices."}
{"text":"The steak tartare appetizer here is a must. 

Our table wasn't ready when we showed up for our reservation, and the octopus we ordered never arrived at the table, but the place was packed and a bit chaotic near the kitchen line (where our table was). None the less, we left happy customers. The service was professional and attentive despite how busy it was. But, be prepared for a pricey bill if you order a full three courses with wine."}
{"text":"I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could. 

Food was great. Service impeccable. 

We started with oysters and shrimp. Both were delicious with great sauces. The shrimp were huge and perfectly cooked. 

We then split the yellowtail (light and delicious), oyster sliders (very satisfying - probably my favourite of the night), mussels (probably the best mussels I've ever had - the broth was beautiful, the mussels large and perfectly cooked and the bread was delicious), scallop with foie gras and duck. The scallop dish was great. I've never had anything like it before - a nice mix of sweet and savoury. 

The dessert was apple pie. It was ok. Not bad by any stretch but nothing special. It was the only thing that I would skip next time. 

Our server was amazing and the room is beautiful. Chairs are comfy and I wish it had been summer - the beachy feel of the space must be gorgeous when it's sunny out. 

We will absolutely be back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty. Everything was very rich in flavour so it's kind of good that everything was in small portions (although not good to the wallet). I had the bacon flat bread, which was kind of salty. Then the scallops with a side of broccoli. Scallops came with risotto which was very very rich. Broccoli was soooo yum! Definitely order it if your wallet can bear it. It was a little loud at first (around 8pm on a Tuesday night) so a bit hard to have a business dinner."}
{"text":"Went to the chase with high hopes. Friends of ours had recommended it to us knowing we were big oyster fans. A short google search later and we were booked in for Tuesday night. The menu is short, a few classic seafood dishes as well as a few with a fusion flare. We decided to sample some of their most popular dishes, which included ceviche of scallop, tuna nachos with taro chips, oysters on the half shell and seared sea scallops and oyster po boys. All recommended by our waitress. She was helpful and friendly. Our first dish to arrive was the daily special which was scallop ceviche, which was hands down the worst fish and possibly the worst form of scallop I've ever had. It was fishy, not fresh, not appetizing and way too salty. Quite frankly, just thinking about it makes me gag. It was shocking that they had such a dish as their catch of the day. It belonged nowhere near a place that claims to serve fresh and quality seafood. I refused to eat two of our oysters because they were no longer good to eat. When we informed the waitress politely that they were not good she didn't inquire further nor did she offer to replace them with good oysters. Now I understand that sometimes when restaurants get their supplies, a few bad oysters will find there way in, however should be stopped right when the patter is being shucked and before it makes it's way to the table. Especially when your paying 4 dollars plus a shuck. The other dishes were not so memorable, small and over priced too. Overall, if your looking for great seafood, and don't mind paying a premium price for it, your better off at Rodney's where there dishes are straight forward and consistently fresh and simple. Don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"Horrible experience,had to wait for over an hour for our dish plus half hour to get seated (we made a reservation in advance). Service was terrible, and the food did not justify the price. We paid over $300 and this was not worth it.
Would NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really good oysters!! Love all the variety.  I love the open kitchen as well.  A little confusing at the entrance and elevator going to the upper level and little bit awkward going to the rooftop patio.  But over-all, the place is great and the (sea)food is excellent."}
{"text":"If you work in the financial core, you may have caught the Chase food truck making its rounds and serving up great seafood for the past few months. I had had my first taste of the Chase at the Stop's Night Market and like most food-minded folk in the city, have been watching the tweets and instagram posts and ultimately, chasing them down for more information on their double-restaurant opening.
Well, the day finally arrived when I had the chance to check out restauranteur Steven Salm & Chef Michael Steh's (Reds) highly anticipated The Chase and The Chase Fish & Oyster restaurants at a private media night downtown.  And as I sauntered down the beautiful brick alleyway and through the restaurant doors, it became clear that the Chase was well worth the wait.
The restaurants occupy two floors of the stunning historic Dineen Building at 10 Temperance St- The Chase Fish & Oyster restaurant is situated on the ground floor, while the Chase is set 5 floors up, compete with an 80-person rooftop terrace and a 360-degree bar. 
 The downstairs room has a bright, light-hearted nautical theme. The chairs are comfortable and casual, the bar is brimming with fresh oysters, and you can even peak your head into the glass-walled kitchen from outside. 
here's also a stunning patio out front, and plenty of room for lounging and enjoying a lazy glass of wine with a platter of something tasty.
The menu downstairs at the Chase Fish & Oyster, is expectantly, mainly from the sea. There is are raw preparations of fish and shellfish, cold seafood appetizers like Crab Toast, hot items like chowder and lobster rolls, and a few token \"land\" offerings to satisfy the picky fish-phobes in the group.
Upstairs, the vibe is quite different. While still nautical in esthetic, it's more like an upscale \"beach house chic\". Imagine a very wealthy man's summer home with a fully-stocked wine cellar in the wall for all to see, and seriously well-dressed women and men every way you look. 
The banquettes are grand, the chandeliers are divine, and the ceiling to floor windows and low-set tables and chairs prevent anything from impeding the killer view of the downtown core.  Upstairs, Steh describes the food to me as \"progressive American\", blending his Canadian childhood roots with traditional Italian and French cuisine, delicate Asian, rustic Mediterranean and the sensuality of Latin America.
In contrast to the more casual digs downstairs, the menu will encompass both a raw bar component as well as a broader a la carte menu. Both restaurants are aiming to focus on the quality of the ingredients, so preparations and presentations will be done simply without pretense or clutter.
While I don't normally think to comment on service at these types of events, I must say that each and every guest (and this place was packed) were seriously taken care by the staff. Each server and busser consistently checked in to replenish drinks and ask us if we were enjoying the food and atmosphere- a pretty impressive feat considering the place was jam-packed.
If this is the type of service I receive at the Chase at a busy (complementary) event, I can only expect great things as a paying customer at a table sitting down.
Like with the service, the staff at the Chase and the Chase Fish & Oyster also pay exceptional attention to detail in the food. Everything that entered my mouth was fresh, flavourful and well prepared, and I left the evening buzzing with excitement for my first full meal. Here's a little overview of what we tasted and drank.
Sea of Cortez (Tequila, Agave, Grapefruit, Chartreuse)
Red Sky (Absolut Elyx, Strawberry Vanilla Syrup, Lime, Cava)
Oysters with assorted accompaniments

{"text":"Dined here a few times as there is two restaurants one is located upstairs called \"The Chase\" and more towards the special occasion out, and the other is called \"The Chase fish & oyster\". The key difference is one is more casual then the other that being \" The Chase fish & Oyster\" but basically focused around  seafood. 

I generally go to the \"The Chase Fish & Oyster\" and they have a great decor with a open kitchen to view as you enter to see the the team of chefs prepare the food. They have a great selection of cocktails and daily specials but I always start off with the \"yonge platter\" which has a selection of \"clams, oysters, and tuna, which is a good to share between two people or yourself if you like."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. I come here a lot with clients and every time this place is on point and never disappoints. Very chic decor, great cocktail menu and delicious food menu."}
{"text":"Great service from all the staff.   Made room for us on the Rooftop for pre-dinner drinks before our dinner downstairs.   Patio is amazing and has heaters for cool nights.   cocktails and oysters are very good.   Entrées were all excellent and prices are reasonable for the quality.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We came here for my bf's birthday a few months ago, and it was a very enjoyable experience.

The ambiance can't be beat and it's a great place to people watch.

All of our food was amazing, and they cook a rare steak to perfection.

I'll come back one day in the future for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome bread - hot and fresh topped with that amazing truffle butter!
I tried their beef tartar, cod, and strawberry parfait. Best cod I have had in a long time! Very fatty and buttery, with a perfectly crunch skin. Beef tartar was also very good, huge portion though, esp if you consume all the bread that comes with it. 
Their desserts are all quite filling - both my strawberry parfait and my friend's lime meringue. 
Nice atmosphere, though a touch pretentious. Very good service. Cool rooftop patio."}
{"text":"I was here on a Thursday evening with colleagues. The 5th floor has some spectacular views and is ideal for groups. Since I don't like seafood (unfortunate but true) I had lamb chops, along with salad as an appetizer as well as a key lime cake type dessert. Everything was delicious and the service was good too. The place does get pretty lively and seems to transition from an after work crowd to more of a date type place after about 8 or so. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is literally one of the best places I've been to in Toronto. It is pricey but the food and service makes it so worth it. The oysters were an amazing selection, and everyone loved what they got for main course. I usually never get dessert but I tried my friends key lime pie and I would actually go back for that alone. Really cool place!"}
{"text":"best patio in city.  great food great atmosphere"}
{"text":"I love it! They use the best ingredient to give the best flavour to us! Amazing! The fish you must try!!!! It really fantastic!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, scrumptious oysters, beautiful presentation! The tuna appetizer was the best.absolutely everything was perfect."}
{"text":"After all the great reviews I've seen for The Chase, we must have been exceptionally unlucky.  We arrived promptly for our 6:30 reservation.  The restaurant itself is beautiful.  It was very busy and from the outset the service was incredibly slow.  It took 1/2 hour to receive 1 glass of wine and bread.  We even had to ask for bread, even though it was on all the other tables.  The focaccia bread with melted strawberry butter and chives was absolutely delicious.  We were happy the portion was large as we waited so long for our other courses that we ending up devouring the whole loaf.

We decided to splurge on the appetizer and ordered the Burrata for 2 which cost $44.  What a disappointment.  Burrata is supposed to be served at room temperature so that it is very creamy and runny.  This was straight out of the fridge and as solid as any regular mozzarella.  The sour dough crisps that came with it were delicious but so thin, you couldn't put the cheese on them, they just disintegrated.  It was supposed to be served with guanciale, and there were 2 crumbs of it on the plate. The dressing was so scant as to be tasteless, and there were a few other small drips of things on the plate.  This was a complete fail and incredibly over priced even if it had been served properly. 

Then the real wait began!  Our server periodically reappeared and said our mains should be up soon.  After being there for over 1 1/2 hours we spoke to the manager who went to hunt down our food. After about 5 minutes our food arrived and it was cold!! However there was no way we were sending it back because we were starving.  

I ordered the butter poached lobster ($55).  There are 2 main pieces of lobster, one of which was completely overcooked and rubbery, and the other one was perfectly cooked and delicious (but cold).  My husband had the Arctic Char, which was delicious (but cold).  The frites were so cold that we didn't eat them.  Key lime cake for dessert was excellent.  The manager very kindly took care of our bill due to the poor service and cold food, but I would have rather had a great meal and paid the bill."}
{"text":"My hubby brought me here in the summer for dinner. While the food was good, I had the lobster pasta, the service was terrible. Also not worth the price in my books."}
{"text":"After trying over 150 restaurants in Toronto, this is one of my favourites by far. I came here with 3 girlfriends and ordered a ton of food. The ambiance is eloquent, the service was impeccable and the food was hands down delish. I started the evening with the clam chowder soup which came with a side of rum (let's pause there.... what a GREAT way to start a meal.) The rum comes in an eye dropper type bottle and after asking the sever, it was to be used as a condiment so I could add as much or as little as I wanted. The soup didn't need it but it was a well added touch of depth to the dish since the alcohol contrasted the smooth creamy flavours of the chowder. For my main I had the whole fish, which was filleted at my table served on a bed of potatoes and leeks all in a light, white broth. The flavours of this dish were spot on and the reason for this being my favourite restaurant. Between my friends I also tried the lobster roll, oyster po'boy sliders, poke and the key lime pie. Everything was amazing and 100% worth the price. I don't mind spending a lot of money for good food and that's what you get here. Can't  wait to try the Chase upstairs next!"}
{"text":"I went to The Chase for Winterlicious last night. 

Food was alright. The deduction of the stars, and the accompanying irritated tone of this review come largely from the unapologetic hostess and the time it took us to eat our food. If you sense a hint of passive-aggressive tone in my review, you're not mistaken. I honestly truly and desperately wanted to say something, but I was on a date after months of long distance.

We made a reservation at 8:45, but were seated at 9:05. For that twenty minutes, we awkwardly stood around the full bar, squeezing into each other as the waiting staff passed behind us. When the hostess finally came, she didn't even offer an apology. Just came to us and took us to our table without a word. No \"sorry about the wait.\" No \"This way, watch the step,\" nothing. Not even a smile. 

The first course, salmon tartare, came timely. The waiting staff was helpful and nice. 
Food itself was alright, the tartare flavourful, although the crostini bread was oily, like it was sitting around for a while. 

The main course, the char, came yet another 20 minutes later. Again, the food itself was alright. Char was good, slightly overdone for my taste, but good. The whole plate went together nicely, even though I had to eat the potato rosti separately because it was overpowering the fish and the subtle sweetness of the cabbage. 

The dessert, caramelized banana sundae, was really good. I'm not big on sweets, but I really enjoyed it. 

And of course, they took no time receiving payments, as they brought the card machine along with the bill. Don't really have anything against this in particular, just thought it was ironic considering how ridiculously long it took for us to sit down at our reserved table."}

___________________________________________________________________
Dear The Chase - Fish & Oyster,
I have decided you are very much like the Keg.  Or Milestones on a good night. Perhaps Earls...except at least I find Earls friendly with great customer service. 

I have been to your restaurant three times now. The truth hurts, but I think you are trying too hard. Just relax and let it be. if your food is good, the vibe is good, people will come.  Stop with the trend of training your staff on the finer parts of faux and fakery and work on providing guests with top experience for top dollar. 

You lost me when the \"sommelier\" decided to \"sample\" my bottle of $70 screw top wine (PS - an average bottle of red wine easily found in stores for $23.95).  I was a bit perturbed and preplexed when he, with great drama, poured himself a full glass, swirling and sipping before finally declaring the wine \"excellent\" and \"drinkable\".  Needless to say we were very unimpressed with the pretentious atmosphere he created -  certainly the bottle of wine did not require the attention of a sommelier - and his arrogance in sampling the wine with a very very generous pour, standing table side and sipping it while talking to a colleague was completely inappropriate. 

The pretension of your \"sommelier\" was only eclipsed by your manager, who I specifically sought out to quietly express my opinion regarding the resident sommelier who had coiffed down a third of our bottle of quite ordinary wine to determine its suitability for drinking.  The manager should be commended for his stoic and firm response that was so far removed from customer service it could be a case study in a \"what not to do\" vignette.  

So Chase, Fish & Oyster, on my next big night out when I have something to celebrate and am looking for something along the lines of a Keg,  Milestones or other chain of mediocrity, I will be sure to call because you at least take reservations."}
{"text":"Posh yet comfortable atmosphere.  Octopus appetizer is decent, but not as good as similar versions I've tried elsewhere.  Fish & Chips isn't too heavy and comes lightly battered.  I'd say $$$$ here is overpriced -- $$$ would be more reasonable for what you're actually getting."}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience. Most restaurants try to limit you to a 2 hour dining time, but they didn't. They allowed us to take our time and enjoy a night out while slowly ordering drinks, apps, our meal, etc. Great food and service. It's definitely not cheap though."}
{"text":"The food is superb. Bravi to the kitchen. The interior design is beautiful, impeccable and just right. A strange mix of people come here, king west clubbers, suburban nouveaux riche, financial district people, tourists and people that get Toronto Life magazine and know that this place serves delicious food in some seriously nice digs. 

What gets me down about this place is it still feels like I'm dining at a restaurant adjacent to a club, like Patria or something. The clientele is superficial and vapid. Lots of fake lips and boobs and people sizing each other up. Lame. The staff are young and a bit naive but I can look past that part. Worth going back for the food."}
{"text":"Took an out of town friend here for his birthday dinner. The food was excellent- we had the avocado roll and the halibut.  However, having been a server for 15+ years including plenty of fine dining, there are a few basics that they got wrong and left a bad taste in my mouth (sorry). The first course took a little while to come out- not a problem. But then they tried to take it away when we were about halfway through it.  The waiter then approached to tell us that the mains were ready and could we finish up.  This wasn't one of those special dishes that takes a certain amount of time to cook- she just fired it at the wrong time, or the first course just took too long.  So we had to stuff the rest of our $30 appetizer down our throats as the mains were put down. This is my pet peeve. DO NOT RUSH ME. I'm not talking about taking hours- because that is silly- but I just want to literally be able to swallow my first course before the second arrives.  The halibut was FANTASTIC- but a very very hearty portion (as it should be for $95/2 people.)  She had tried to upsell us with sides initially, and I asked \"well does the halibut come with anything?\" and she said \"just some steamed spinach.\" Luckily we didn't order sides-- I am a good eater but couldn't even finish this dish.  Had we ordered sides it would have been way too much food, and I found that completely obnoxious.  Then we tried to order dessert wines and they were out of 2 of the 4 they had.  A simple solution to this would have been offering us one of the ones that they had at the price point we were looking for. I am not a cheap person, but I wanted to pay $16 not $26. So we left without having anything.

All in all, great food, amateur service.  Unfortunately I won't go back- I am happy to pay $250 for dinner for 2 if it's an excellent experience.  Maybe I caught someone on a bad day, but I won't risk it again."}
{"text":"Neglectful, pretentious, and deeply incompetent service. Good seafood and an excellent sommelier (Heather)."}
{"text":"Damn. 

There is a Bay Street premium on the food here but you better well believe that it's worth it. The seafood here is as fresh as it gets. 

Here is what we ordered: 

1) Yonge Platter: raw platter of oysters, clams, shrimp and tuna. This was a decent enough portion for $50, especially considering how delicious it all was. The tuna was marinated in some kind of Asian vinegary dressing, and my boyfriend remarked how it brought him straight back to the freshest fish he's had in Japan. 

2) Tuna \"nachos\": this was a dish of taro chips with chunks of raw ahi tuna on top. There was way more tuna than taro chips, which is definitely good value for money. I wished it was a little more \"nacho\" like but the flavours were amazing and it was eaten much too quickly. 

3) Okonomiyaki: we were a bit hesitant to order so traditionally-Japanese a dish at this kind of restaurant, but I trusted that they could pull it off. And did they ever deliver. It was a good-sized pancake, chock full of salmon, scallop and shrimp and bonito flakes on top. It was very authentic, and each bite gave a mouthful of seafood. By then, we were pretty full from all of the fresh seafood protein but it was SO good. Best dish of the night and easily top 3 dishes for both of us, ever. 

The fresh bread + butter was also amazing. It was warm and had a buttery crust, as if it had been pan-baked. The butter was pre-salted, which is not done enough! We also had a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc to go with our meal. Total came out to roughly $230 with tax and tip. Pricy night out but god, it reminded us of how much we love seafood and how delicious it can be when fresh."}
{"text":"3.5/5! The downstairs is definitely better food than the upstairs (The Chase). Highly recommend the mussels and oysters! Great ambiance and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"The Chase Fish & Oyster opens at the renovated building at Temperance & Yonge, across from Goodlife at where the old Oriental Gourmet House used to be.

Note that at the time of this review, it had only recently opened to the public so I'm giving generous allowance for \"working out the menu\" and \"working out the system\".  We went in to sample the menu and my review is based on a sampling experience.  I don't think it's fair yet to judge this venue to the same degree as an established venue with a well-oiled staff.

The menu is divided into A) seasonal (oysters, shrimp, clams and lobster); B) hot and cold apps; C) mains; and D) side orders.  I would say the menu was generally priced around par for the area (ie. within walking distance to the headquarters of all the banks).  The decor is of exposed bricks and veneered wood tables, and the spacing comfortable, with a much larger floorspace than the nearby Rodney's on Bay.  Single person washrooms in the basement.

Oysters had their own seasonal menu and had a half-dozen selection from the east coast and west coast; we found our server was quick and able with explaining the varieties.  We tried the Totten Virginica (meaty, briny) and Cooke's Cove (sweet), served with the usual garnishes: lemon slices, horse radish, a vinaigrette, a salsa and mustard.  We recommend eating the oysters with just lemon, everything else was too over-powering.

We tried a cold app (yellowfin); two hot apps (summer chowder, steamed mussels); and a main (fried chicken for kicks).  We could only recommend the mussels and its broth, and we certainly wouldn't mind the absence of its accompanying fries.  Credit goes to the kitchen for filling the chowder with plenty of seafood pieces, we just didn't find the chowder as a whole to our liking.

The wait service was excellent and very courteous, we never found them overbearing nor inattentive; the only very slight disservice was of not knowing the menu nor the providence of their seafood inside-out but at this point of their opening, that's understandable.

For now, if you're in the area to try something new and in the mood for seafood, I think Chase F&O can be an interesting spot.  Otherwise, I think the kitchen has yet to work up its potential and it may be tempted to cater to the banker crowd without earning culinary credibility."}
{"text":"My 2nd poor experience. Our server was inattentive. Our wine was never decanted and we ended having to get up and pour our own. 1 person in our party ordered a steak and it came out at least 15 min after the rest of our party's meals. When it  was brought out it was way over done. They said sorry & offered to buy us drinks but by that time our meals were done. It was a very disappointing experience & after this I will not return and will be sure to not recommend this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"Had lunch there on Friday afternoon. Ordered the halibut; cooked to perfection and delicious. Great service."}
{"text":"Treated like royalty!

We booked a table to celebrate a friend's birthday. After some reservation confusion, we were given the private room for our party of 10! Talk about VIP, albeit, unintentional.

The private room is downstairs, secluded and intimate. 

We had one server for our party. Nothing went unnoticed and unattended. Excellent service!


We tried almost everything on the menu. 

Standouts:


Drinks: Cava Brut, Sigsbee Deep (tequila based, amazing flavours)

Food:

Oysters - can't go wrong, just know your preference in oysters

Stone crab claws - yummmm!!! 

Octopus - incredible, the best octopus I've ever had. So many places get it wrong. It's not your \"let the octopus shine\" dish. Rather, it has complex flavours (Harissa and pork sausage complement the octopus so well)

Oyster Po' Boy sliders - incredible, layered with different texture and spices. The little \"salad\" it comes with, is incredibly tasty.

Fried chicken - great breading. Watch for the spicy butter (not for uninhibited).

Steak - good portion, done to perfection, mushroom ragout is complex, hearty.

California Roll - fresh and crisp.

Uneventful: 

Halibut (ceviche style, not great, lacks flavour)  and Acorn squash (baked, but tough). 

It's on the pricey side but it was worth every penny. 

Our entire party said we would return in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to have lunch at Chase today and what an experience. Our table was touched by at least 5 personnel from the server to the wine steward to the bussers, the service was 5 star. We had the buffalo mozzarella and California roll to start which blew my mind. My main was the homemade gnocchi in pesto with roasted veggies. Delicious. Highly recommend but not light on your pocket book."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and nice staff, but the food was terrible.

The clams in the chowder had sand in them - my boyfriend actually chewed on a little rock. It happens so we didnt complain at this point. 

We got two orders of steamed crab which turned out to be gross..dried out yet soggy at the same time. Came out half cold. I assumed it had already been chilled then reheated before being served. The server confirmed this to be true and said it was their normal way of serving steamed crab. She did offer to bring us a fresh order...but what's the point if it's gonna be the same gross thing? Googling \"Best crab in toronto\" was how my boyfriend found this place!

We ate about a third of it because we were both trying to be considerate and not ruin my bday dinner...until my boyfriend said something first at which point we both stopped eating immediately.

When the bill came it was actually more than what we were supposed to be charged. Our server said the crab was $23 per order but we ended up being charged $30 per. 
We werent expecting her to take the crab off the bill because hey, they think their way of serving crab is up to standard and it's a matter of personal preference that we didn't like it. But it would've been nice for them to show some kind of gesture. It doesnt have to be anything grand - there's just so many ways to go about it instead of dropping off the bill like we just had a great dinner. 

It's a shame that we won't be going back cause we thought it was such a well-decorated, neat place."}
{"text":"The food was very well prepared and delicious.  However the price is ridiculously high for what you get.  I'm not one for huge US portions but $42 for 3 Sashimi roll sized venison is a little much.  The entire meal was over $300 for 2 people.  My guess ordered the chicken.  It was very good but presented in only half the plate.  Looked like something was missing.  The 3 piece cheese plate was very good but again overpriced at $21. 

Nice high end place but over priced."}
{"text":"We went to chase for valentines day with another couple. They had customized a la carte menu at around $65. I'm a big fan of bisque and order the Lobster bisque which was AMAZING (Definitely try it). for the main course I ordered the fish which was also so tasty. The environment was really cozy and comfortable (although you must dress up). The staff were very friendly and helpful. Overall we had an amazing experience dining at Chase."}
{"text":"Went here last night, was very pleased.  Had the surf & turf special, it was fresh and delicious.  The appetizers and sides are a lot of fun as well.  The sun chokes are a must and the Key lime pie."}
{"text":"I had booked a table for summerlicious for a large group of us (9 ppl) but I accidentally booked it at the Chase upstairs, not to be confused with the Chase Fish and Oyster Bar below. When we arrived at The Chase (upstairs) they saw my note saying that we wanted to have the summerlicious menu and advised us that it was only at the restaurant downstairs. Instead of showing us the door, they quickly accomodated us (even though they were fully booked) and offered us their private dining room!
The room was great and we had a blast. Service was quick and our waitress was very nice. I had the best deep fried oyster I've ever had. Despite the grey sauce as a side that might turn some people off, it tasted yummy. I had the BBQ short rib sandwich and was pleasantly surprised at how spicy the dish was. I wasn't such a fan of the side though which was a potato salad. 
I had the blueberry crumble for dessert and it was delicious!
I definitely want to go back and try their regular menu and also check out the Chase upstairs. It has killer views of the city.
Very classy, love the ambience, yummy food and quick service."}
{"text":"Quiet, spacey and modern atmosphere. Waiters and waitresses were very kind. The food was good. We had a daily catch (Snapper), pan-seared which was very delicious. The oyster starter was was slightly too salty. The claim chowder was good. The yellowfin tuna was good as well."}
{"text":"This place is one of the greatest gems TO has to offer. Beautiful decor, great location, super genuine staff and (most importantly) phenomenal food."}
{"text":"Amazing! Went here for Valentines day, the decor is beautiful and I loved the ambiance. Had the short ribs and avocado for appetizers which are a must-have! The service is outstanding as well."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!! I went with a few friends last weekend for a friend's birthday.  The mussel dish is a MUST EAT DISH!!! i've never had such large mussels before. we also got the seafood tower.  I thought for $110 it was a bargin.  very fresh.  i'm planning to go back with my parents.  i'm sure they will love it."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood, we had the Yonge plate and some appetizer after, it was a great meal."}
{"text":"My husband I truly enjoyed our meals. We ordered the octopus, crab sandwich with wedges, the sea platter and for desert the banana split. 
Everything was very tasty. The service for fine and staff really tried to please us. 
Recommend and will return for sure."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to my dinner at the Chase given its status and reputation in the city. Unfortunately, our experience dining at this Bay Street institution did not live up to expectations. I made a reservation at 8.45pm on a Thursday night, which of course meant that the odds of being seated at the reserved time were slim. I was less than surprised when our hostess let us know that our table was still \"finishing dessert\".

 I am not sure what kind of dessert the guests at our table were having but it must have been a multi-course dessert because 45 minutes later, we were still sitting in the lounge with our drinks. It took exactly an hour to finally be seated and suffice to say that not a single staff member came off as genuinely apologetic. It seems to me that this restaurant has already taken on a pretentious attitude that people should consider themselves \"lucky\" to dine there. The single and only time the manager came to our table was to drop off an amuse bouche, which I assumed was a gesture for the delay in seating, but an apology was never once verbally uttered. In fact, aside from never once returning back to the table, on my way to the bathroom I witnessed him leaving to go home with a restaurant packed full on a Thursday night. 

Luckily, our server was excellent and I really had no complaints as she was extremely friendly and professional throughout the night. The same cannot be said about the sommelier who must have been having a bad day because I don't think I saw her smile once. To make matters worse, our mains took over half an hour to arrive after our appetizers took a mere 8 minutes. It pains me to rate this restaurant so low because the food really is outstanding. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the way they treat people here. The least they could have done was comp the two drinks we had at the lounge, but with an absent/nonchalant manager that night, that did not happen. As such, I simply cannot recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Based on the positive reviews, I chose to celebrate my birthday at The Chase Fish & Oyster.

Location: Off Temperance between Queen and King on Yonge. Major construction on Temperance right now so the restaurant is only accessible by foot. Valet parking is available for $20 or you can park on Adelaide in the Scotiabank underground for $9 flat (weekends). It's about a two minute walk.

Facility: Modern and clean. Atmosphere is romantic and dim, the noise-level is average to loud on a weekend night. Washrooms are individual stalls. Beautiful location with an upscale feel.

Food Quality & Price: Food was good. I celebrated my birthday at The Chase Fish and Oyster and ordered one of every oyster on the menu and then more of the ones I liked. There is an \"Oyster card\" on each table so you can indicate the amount of oysters you want a la carte. No prices are listed and oyster card is not up to date. I had to ask our server who updated us on the available oyster types that day.

THE MENU LAYOUT IS NOT CLEAR. The Hot/Raw section are ALL appetizer (app sizes) and the \"accessories\" are sides. Everything to the right under those little animal icons are ENTREES. No one clarified this at the restaurant, and nearly half my party ended up with appetizers as their mains.

Portions are TINY even compared to your typical fine dining fare. Most of our party, despite ordering appetizers ended up finding more food after we left. The food was also slow to come. We sat down at 7pm, didn't get out appetizers until 8:30 and then mains finally arrived at 10pm!!

Service: During booking and reservations, I had email correspondence with Erica, who was lovely. Our party exceeded 12 people (which The Chase requires you to have a fixed/customized menu). I strongly preferred the restaurants menu and Erica cleared it with the chefs and was able to accommodate my request. I was very pleased and excited to celebrate my birthday (and my friend's).

Upon arrival at the restaurant, our server (I believe his name was Eric), did his job satisfactorily. He answered questions and took orders. However, he didn't clarify the menu and never bothered to correct us when the entire table ordered an appetizer thinking it was an entree. When I commented on the issue, he simply said \"Oh, I thought I told you.\" He was only warm and friendly when one of my friends asked about his life. Eric discussed his degrees and how he had recently gone to another job interview. I definitely got the impression that he felt too good for this job. I was not satisfied with my food, but didn't bother to order another, as everyone else's entrees arrived and were mostly finished. I then reminded him that it was not only my birthday, but that my friend in the corner's as well. Eric acknowledged.

My husband later discreetly pulled Eric aside to tell him about how I felt  (I didn't know this) and reminded him that it was my birthday and if there was anything special he could do. He reported Eric becoming slightly defensive and not very helpful. In the end, Eric brought out a Strawberry Cheesecake for me. It was comped by The Chase, which was very thoughtful. But he did not do anything for my other birthday friend?!

At the end of the night, I was embarrassed by the experience and had to apologize to my friends for their long wait and small portions (especially to the men), telling them that I chose The Chase Fish & Oyster for their reputation for good food and service on Yelp. 

Overall: I enjoyed the quality of the food, but the overall experience left much to be desired. I do not think I will return to or recommend The Chase Fish & Oyster."}
{"text":"The historical Dineen building at the corner of Yonge and Temperance has finally received what it's been missing all these years - a series of coffee shops and restaurants worth visiting!  Among the new additions to the building lies 'The Chase'.  Located on the fifth floor of the building (just a quick elevator ride up from The Chase Fish and Oyster on the street level), 'The Chase' provides exactly what the financial district has been lacking - A place with great food for both the lunch and dinner crowd, as well as bringing some life to the fincial district during the evening hours with its vibrant bar scene and later hours of business.

With the closing of 'South of Temperance' earlier this year as a result of the construction of Bay/Adelaide East, and very few dining options (besides The Gabardine, Blowfish and Mercato on Bay) in the close vicinity for those working in the adjacent Bay/Adelaide Centre - the area has been oversaturated with food courts for the lunch time crowd, leaving few options for an after hours dinner and drink.  

Working in the close vicinity, I have visited The Chase on several occassions since its opening this past August, and I find it to be one of those places I keep returning to - whether it be for dinner or an after work drink with colleagues and friends, I have not been disappointed!

Upon arrival to the fifth floor, it's hard not to instantly notice the panoramic views of the city from the rooftop terrace, as well as from the floor to ceiling windows surrounding the restaurant and bar area - absolutely stunning!

The decor is that of casual elegance, with white crown moulding in the interior, floor to ceiling glass walls revealing a spectacular view of the city, as well as sparkling crystal chandeliers hanging above the grey and purple coloured seating areas.  The restaurant is divided in what appears to be three different areas - an outdoor terrace, a vibrant corner bar, as well as a more intimate dining area; thus, catering to the various needs of its customers.

Besides the breathtaking views and lavish decor, what really sets this restaurant apart is the presentation and flavour of its food.  The menu is a mix of contemporary north american apetizers, fish, meats, share plates, pastas and vegetables, with what appears to be more of a seafood focus (many dishes include the likes of tuna, oysters, crab, shrimp, salmon, scallops, cod, octopus, lobster and habibut - however, there are several dishes to choose from if seafood is not your thing).  Portion sizes are substantial (an appetizer and a main should do it for most) and each dish is extremely flavourful.  My favourite dish is the \"Avocado\", which is avocado stuffed with shrimp and sweet corn, with a salad of celery and fennel.  For those who like to finish off their meals with something sweet - there is also a small dessert menu, including a delectable flourless cake layered with chocolate mousse, milk chocolate cream and hazelnut fudge which simply melts in your mouth!

For a new dining establishment, I feel that 'The Chase' has done a great job overall, and I look forward to future visits.  The one thing I would say is that the service still requires some improvement, more so on the side of its servers in developing more of a solid knowledge of their menu items, especially their wine selection.  There was one evening where our party was asking questions about some of the wines, to which our server kept responding with 'i guess' and 'i think', until she could not take the pressure anymore and finally went to ask the Sommelier (which in my opinion is what she should have done in the first place if she did not know, rather than spending time trying to make her best guess and convince us of the same).  Again, like any new resto, I appreciate that it will take some time to iron out the kinks.  In fairness, the establishment's wine selection is quite extensive, with selections from various parts of the world.

All in all, I would definitely recommend a visit to 'The Chase' for those looking to try something new within the financial district or anyone who is looking for a venue for that next special occassion."}
{"text":"Great place in the financial district, where most sit down restaurants are often supremely overpriced, and not even good. This place is not cheap or 'good value' but it's good food, in a spotty area. 

We started with oysters, which were delicious. You can't really screw up oysters as long as they're fresh, but it's surprising how many 'oyster/seafood' places often have sub par oysters. A+ for The Chase

Ordered a bunch of sharing plates: the smoked salmon (very good), smoked sturgeon (larger than we thought, but a bit over salted), crab toast (for once I will say that a dish did not actually need bacon. Crazy, I know, but it didn't), seared scallop (loved the accompaniment of foie gras, duck breast, and a sweet brioche bottom, but disappointed that the fixings were quite small, and there was only 1 scallop in the dish for $21. It was really good, but really overpriced), and the Arctic Char main (decent, nothing too special about the preparation of the fish, but the sides were delicious).

Also had the chowder, which is manhattan style and very good. Was very surprised (and happy) that the soup was practically unsalted, so you can actually taste it. 

Shared a dessert of their take on key lime pie. Disappointing.

Truly, the rating should be a 3.5 but I can't really give it a 4."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I've had. 

Waiter forgot parts of our order. Food was tasteless - including cod, salmon, and rib eye. Time better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"The oyster were outrageous, thank you sweet boss for taking care of the bill and being the kind of guy who says we'll take another dozen of those. We were a table of 7 and they were extremely efficient without being conversation interruptions. I had the lobster bisque which was fantastic and my coworkers all had the lobster dinner and basically the table was silenzio while our mains were in front of us which I think is pretty indicative of their calibre. The bathrooms are stellar. High fives all around."}
{"text":"Went here for date night with the hubby last Wednesday. Excellent service, decor, food and wines. The raw bar platter for two was spot on. The duck on squash was very tasty as was the Arctic char.   No small portions here. You get what you pay for. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Beautiful views. Service was Good. My cod main course was a little bland but my beef tartare was the best I have had. Wine list has a good range in price. Overall i would go back"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday for drinks and apps at the chase fish and oyster. Dining for one always makes me a little uncomfortable, but they welcomed me with open arms. I had the Charles baker Riesling, which is my favorite wine- I was happy they had it by the glass. I also had the ricotta gnocchi with Anaheim chilies and grilled gala Apples. I also tried sunchokes for the first time and was amazed by the taste and texture. Finishing, I tried their shoestring fries with a herb aioli. The bartender was very sweet and engaged me in conversation noticing I was a big uncomfortable being alone. 

Needless to say, I'll be back at the chase fish and oyster soon !"}
{"text":"Excellent meal and experience! Pricey but worth if for a special occasion! Pearl platter was fantastic and octopus was great. Avocado with shrimp was good but the texture was a bit off as there is lettuce in the roll. Best part of the meal= the bread (apricot truffle butter!) and the strawberry cheesecake sundae-cant wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I went to The Chase's more casual seafood and oyster section for my birthday. I absolutely loved it! The staff went above and beyond to make sure the evening was special. I cannot remember the name of our waitress but she was very helpful and polite, probably the best service I have received as of yet. The food was amazing as well! No complaint at all. I ordered the tuna nachos and the crab lasagna. Both were delicious and the lasagna had lots of crab on top. Loved this place and would totally go again!"}
{"text":"Have been hearing abt the Chase group for a lot of ppl.  Meant to book the Chase restaurant but it was full, so we ended up in the fish and oyster bar.

Food: Overall taste and presentation was decent but quite a lot of mishap during our meal.  My frd ordered virgin Caesar but it ended up tasting like some weird tomato juice.  Then, they forgot to put side ingredient (sausage) into the octopus dish :9 they brought a small bowl out for us to mix in.  Lastly, 3 of us ordered the surf and turf ( clams and rabbit dish).  One of the rabbit dish was undercooked, so they had to remake it.  On a positive note, the halibut ceviche, Po boy slider, scallop ravioli were all tasty, portion on the smaller side.  Dessert were in generous portion and yummy tho!

Service: Excellent.  Were greeted by the staff and asked if it was our first time, they constantly check in to ensure our dining experience  was  good.  They tried to make up for their mistakes.  The undercooked dish was remade and drink was sent back.

Ambience: pretty average dining room, just what you would except"}
{"text":"Fantastic oysters, fish and (surprisingly) fried chicken. Every entree was delicious and the staff gave us a free order of the fried chicken just to try. When we mentioned we had a birthday amongst our party they also brought over a complimentary cake. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Tonight I hosted colleagues from Montreal and everything was fabulous! We started with oysters and moved to seafood appetizers and mains.  The Arctic Char, Octopus, and Tuna were excellent! The selection of cheeses after dinner could be improved, after all the standard was high with my colleagues from Montreal!"}
{"text":"I brought two friends from out of town to the Chase after much thought, debating between the Chase fish & oyster (downstairs), canoe and Richmond Station. I was on my down time and hence not suited up, so I had doubts about the Chase despite good reviews due to my fears that the service would be heavily skewed towards the Bay St crowd - but I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately I should have listened to my initial premonition. 

We had the tuna, lobster appetizer, seafood platter, chicken as well as desserts. The food was very good and I had no complaints there. The food should be rated at 4 stars. 

However, I was very annoyed for most of the meal due to the spotty service. We sat at our table for 15 minutes without anyone coming to greet us or bring us water. It took another 10 minutes to get three glasses of water or any menu at all - only when we asked a busser again - does it really take that much time to pour three glasses? The waitress then came by to hand us a drink menu with a mumble and left for another 5 minutes. She spent most of her time serving her other customers and ignoring our attempts to catch her eye. We eventually had to flag her down to get food menus. The waitress then stood at some distance from our table and whispered behind her hand while staring at us to what looked like a hostess (no matter what you're saying, this looks rude) and then disappeared. We were then served by another waitress who handed us food menus without any sort of introduction as to the switchover. I assume the first waitress was busy with other tables and asked for relief, but usually at most places they'll come by and say that another server will be by or something but not here. 

Moving forward, the second waitress was more friendly but I had already been given a bad impression for the first 30 minutes of my time at the restaurant. Also, someone that looked like a floor manager of some sort was walking around, schmoozing with the suits but seemed blind to the fact three customers were sitting at an empty table with nothing in front of them for almost 20 minutes - no water, no cutlery, no menus. 

When you bring out of town friends to a high end restaurant, you do this to ensure the experience will be perfect in food, service and the atmosphere - indeed this was far from perfect as the service ruined the gorgeous decor and good food. I didn't want to ruin the mood by complaining and hoped the service would improve - but at best, it reached the level of a milestones or joeys - except I was paying double to triple the price.

I've been to many high-end restaurants all over and what separates the truly excellent places from the good but pretentious is that they don't just have great food, they have excellent service no matter who the customer is. It is clear at the Chase that their service depends on how \"important\" you look to their servers. I was really disappointed and wished I had gone with my usual standby of Canoe, which serves every customer with impeccable service.

If you look like you're of an older age in a suit, then you probably won't have issues. Even if you have the same money, if you don't look like the corporate type (we were still dressed nicely, don't get me wrong, it's not like we went here in denim cutoffs and flip flops) then expect to be treated like a second class customer. The food wasn't enough to give this place a second chance. In a city like Toronto where restaurants are always popping up, there's no reason for me to waste my money at a place that lacks the staff oversight and management to ensure service is top notch to match their prices."}
{"text":"Second time dining at the Chase. The quality has definitely gone down (in terms of menu and service). They were not accommodating for our table (we were located in the hallway/in front of the bathroom where people repeatedly kicked my chair and a ridiculously cold air draft was present). Food was alright, nothing special and way too expensive for what we paid. Octopus was not cooked the greatest, and by the time I was served my panroast, the bread was soggy and there was barely any seafood (considering this was their most expensive entree, I was highly disappointed). The burrata and beet salad were good, but if this is what lived up to my expectations at a seafood restaurant, there are better options to go to in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group.  Great view of the city - probably one of the nicest patios in the core.

Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly.  The drinks are pricey, but complex made with exotic ingredients.

The focaccia bread is to die for.  Apricot glaze with truffle butter.  Food is great.. portions are what you would expect from a restaurant of this calibre.

Great dining experience!"}
{"text":"My favourite high end restaurant in TO thus far. Have been twice for lunches where I tried the Arctic char and Cornish Hen and dinner last night where I tried the most divine Veal dish I have had since (second only to Hugh's home cooked!). 

Service was fantastic! Well done guys, TO needs more of this"}
{"text":"Just had the most amazing dining experience in Toronto thus far! 
Me and the family are big foodies and we love trying new places and different cuisines. Just dined at The Chase to celebrate moms b'day. The night started off rocky because our table wasn't available in time for our reservation (the group before us were enjoying their time a bit much I guess as well). In fact we got our table 45 minutes late. We waited at the bar though and the staff took  great care of us. We ordered a few amazingly delicious cocktails and kept entertained. They served us a complimentary app while we waited! Dinner was worth the wait.. We got the Avacado app to start, Tuna from the raw menu and Arctic Char and Chicken for 2 for the mains! Each item was more scrumptious than the other 
Complimentary dessert for moms b'day was the cherry on top 
Absolutely great service! Cheers!"}
{"text":"The short critique is that for the money, and even not for the money, but especially, for the ASTONISHINGLY overpriced menu items found at this restaurant, this was easily the worst meal that we have EVER had (we being a party of 5, including one 10 year old child) in Toronto.  The meal in question was eaten on a Saturday night, this past September.  It must also be emphasized that this was NOT the fish and oyster, ground floor restaurant, but the fine dining 5th floor companion restaurant with same entrance on Temperance Street. 

In terms of the service, I have had better, faster, more courteous and personalized service, at a Wendy's restaurant.  We were celebrating a special birthday for my mother who had specifically chosen the Chase based on a really good meal and overall experience that she had here about 3 and half years ago.  Either things have gone seriously downhill or that night was an anomaly as we were unanimous this time in hating our experience from start to finish. 

We had made our reservation a few weeks in advance and had requested seating in a certain area of the restaurant.  Our request was not granted even though the restaurant was not full and we were placed in an uncomfortably drafty back corner, which had little of the only thing worth recommending about this place- ambience.  

From this point forward we were served in a totally ad hoc fashion by no fewer than five of the wait staff, including one of the hostesses and a somelier.  The man we thought would be our dedicated waiter introduced himself at the beginning of the evening only to disappear and then return when another young woman had already come around to take orders from us.  He made a joke about her being in training (she was not, in fact, a new staff member) and was happy to just observe.  It seemed that the staff were much more interested in amusing one another than serving their patrons and the service for the remainder of the night remained very slow and in all respects, poor.  

Complimentary crostini and cheese filled tomato amuse bouches were the only highlights of the meal.  The portions of the appetizers and main courses were perversely small.  My AVACADO (crab meat and avacado arranged in a sushi roll configuration) appetizer was more like an hors d'oevre at a price of $22.00. 
I opted for the salmon entree which, rather than being a thick succulent filet was a thin dry-ish tail with a hefty dose of the dark fleshy underside.  The cuisine-the way the food was dressed up-in both cases could not be said to be uninspired but the substance of the meal was sorely missing.  I am not ordering a $34.00 empty plate with a few spoons of smoked tomato fondue.  I am ordering the SALMON!!  My mom's dish was a similar disappointment.  The $40.00 cod entree while tasty enough was gone in about 4 bites-about the size of a small appetizer. The most egregious part of the meal was when my sister-in-law requested a substitution of shrimp for lobster in the pasta entree but was charged for both!! I did not see the price of the modified dish, which lacked it's most expensive element, but I am sure I would have gasped.  Could failing to mention this beforehand have been said to be pure stupidity or just more gouging?? It matters not as there was no excuse for this! The last straw was when a pre-ordered surprise birthday dessert was not served following our meal but yet another new wait staff face came by with dessert menus. An additional item that we ordered came late.  

So in the final analysis-a disaster.  We left at least as hungry as we arrived but with a particularly bad taste in our mouths, wanting to run from this Chase and into one of the nearest fast-food places outside.  I must say that it would be a great pleasure to see this appalling example of a fine dining establishment go down.  Now that's a mouth watering prospect!"}
{"text":"I'd heard great things from friends about the chase, figured it would be a good choice for a business dinner. I'm always reluctant about getting fish in inland cities, it just never is as good as coastal cities. I think most places keep the best fish themselves and ship the rest off elsewhere. 

Nice decor, and a cool spot. The menu has a lot to choose from. Most of the folks at our table ended up opting for the Salmon. It was just so-so.

The wine list was very good as was the service. 

I expected better food, especially with the rather high prices."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at The Chase last night. Made reservations same day, though they only had 5:45 and 9 available when we called. We took the 9pm seating, and arrived at 8:30 thinking we would grab a drink at the bar downstairs before our meal. They had our table ready for 8:30, which was awesome.

We sat down and waited a little while before receiving a drink menu, but we wanted to take it slow given the amazing view, so that was totally fine with us. The bread to start was incredibly delicious. The outside had a bit of a sweet crunch (not entirely sure what ingredient was responsible for the sweetness, but whatever, it was damn good). The inside was doused in truffle oil, and incredibly soft. 

We ordered the house-made mozzarella to start, which was served with strawberries and a balsamic vinaigrette-- very yummy indeed. I had the smoked ricotta ravioli and the guy sitting with me had the cod. I don't know that I've ever had smoked ricotta in pasta, or even if I've ever had smoked ricotta period, but it was great. The tomato sauce was light and not overbearing, which was nice because it let the cheese stand out. The cod was perfectly cooked, and the accompanying vegetables were delicious too (especially the fingerling potatoes). Though, the flavour could have been a bit bolder overall.

We went with a bottle of Beaujolais because we're nearing the end of summer and we're getting sick of white wine. It paired well with what we ordered and was all-round delightful.

Overall, food was good. The real kicker, though, is the incredible view over the Financial District. It's not really a place for an intimate, romantic evening. If you're looking for a night out where you can feel like you're in the money or trying to impress your date, go to The Chase. It won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Ok on all fronts. Nothing knocked us out of our seats. Service slightly below mediocre. Food slightly above mediocre. Beverage menu slightly above mediocre. Location not exactly central. Decor very nouveau cheap."}
{"text":"Used to be good, but the managers are so racist. They kick us out, because my friend was laying on the table while having the desert. Why?
The boss is racist too, one time there were someone smoking weed on the rooftop. The boss came right on to me and friend and start questioning us, wtf!"}
{"text":"so my boyfriend and I went to this restaurant yesterday for winterlicious, which the whole experience didn't impress me at all. let me start from the beginning as we step into this building...

I made a reservation at 1:45 PM, went there on time and have to wait 5 min because my table wasn't ready yet, fine.

sat down, and have to wait like 15-20 min just to get my waiter to give us the menu and water, meh.

another 5 min to get that waiter to ask us for the food. I ordered seafood salad, sea bream fillet and chocolate and hazelnut for dessert, my boyfriend got the seafood salad, risotto, and the espresso cake, we also order the buttermilk shrimp taco. and we have to wait 10-15 min to get our first dish.

seafood salad:3/5. literally, a chop quarter sized of a cabbage with salad dressing, a few piece of shrimp, squid, and mussel. the only good thing about this dish is the seafood.

sea bream fillet:3/5. fish was ok, I just don't like the tomato sauce that comes with it, nothing too excited about this dish.

taco:2.5/5. very difficult to eat, when I try to eat them, it just got torn apart, and the food inside of it falls everywhere. I think it is because the taco they have is soft, not hard one that I imagined. the flavor was ok, for $6+  a piece and two pieces of shrimp inside the taco, it is not worth it to me.

risotto:1/5. my boyfriend was complaining about this dish been way too sour the whole time, and the reason why I give low rate to it is because at the end when my boyfriend almost finish the dish (he doesn't like to waste food, so he wants to finish it, but eventually he didn't) he found a HAIR sitting on top of the plate, not acceptable. eventually, we end up didn't finish both main courses that we had.

chocolate & hazelnut:1/5. a dough fills with chocolate, so dry and the chocolate was bitter to me, don't like this dessert.

expresso cake:4/5. this is the only dish that I liked, it tastes good. the dessert took us like 20 min to get it, don't know why it took them so much time. we just sat there like 10-15 min before our waiter noticed that we didn't get our dessert yer, eh.
 
service:2/5. the waiter was nice, but he just disappears a lot! it took him such a long time to ask us for the drink and for the food. he gives us the bill before the dessert comes out because as I said on the top, it took us so long to get our dessert. after that we didn't see this guy anymore, we have to flag down another waitress because we wanna go, and that waitress didn't seem to bother us too. 

the bill comes up like $78+, I think with that price I deserve to have a better experience than this one. the restaurant is not even that busy when we came, I don't know why the service is so slow to us! and we are not even full when we left the restaurant."}
{"text":"i went for winterlicious 2016. the food was presented better than tasted. The fish (artic char) was very fatty. The dessert, although pretty was unremarkable with the exception of the peanut ice cream. The salmon app was again not impressive and didnt seem very fresh or high grade. i had much higher expectations based on yelp reviews. Canoe or lee's is better."}
{"text":"What is it about \"The Chase\" that is so exciting?  

The fresh seafood and creative plating?
Perhaps, the beautiful venue with fun waterside theme and napkins with squids on them?
All the buzz and has drawn the attention of the Bay Street crowd.  Maybe it's the sharply dressed clientele?

Whatever it is, I'm hooked and I want another chance to eat here!

The menu had a lot of sharable options.  There were so many items that I wanted to try!  Our server was very friendly and attentive and helped us select items to order.

We started with bevies.
I had a ginger-bourbon cocktail and even though it was pricey ($15), it worth every sip.  The bitter-sweet cocktail was perfectly balanced, still strong and it made you feel all warm and happy.  Cocktails here have become even more popular with the success of head bartender Shane Mulvany. 
Do it, order a drink.. or three.

As for the food, we decided to share the fried oyster po-boys.
They were cute and small.  Each bite was an amazingly medley of deliciousness, soft, crispy, and greasy.

For a main, I went for the crispy pickerel salad as a lighter option.
Surprisingly, it was a really huge salad!
The fish was lightly battered and not heavy at all.
The greens were crispy and plentiful.  I wish some of the greens were sliced a bit smaller though, a bit of effort to eat.

We decided not to go for dessert, but I won't be able to resist next time.
Lobster rolls were popular.   Another item for next time. 
Fish taco. Mmmm.
Oysters, next time definitely oysters!

Yeah... hooked.  You got me!"}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely lives up to it's hype. We came on a Monday. It was AYCE oyster night. We opted out of that because we wanted to try other items on the menu. We had the tuna tartare appetizer, the clam chowder, oysters and fish and chips.  The tuna tartare is well portion and very tasty. Great for sharing. The oysters were so sweet and fresh. A must have in this place. Other items were very good as well.  If you like seafood, you will enjoy coming here. Unfortunately they under estimated the volume of patrons that night, thus service was slow and lacking.  It was nice and friendly but I expect more from a restaurant of this scale.  Definitely go with Valet parking if you don't want to pull your hair out looking for one. Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. Always enjoy the ambience and the food when I go on the Sunday. Would definitely go back. Freshly baked goods."}
{"text":"It was my birthday and we felt like ballers...so after a fantastic dinner at Canoe, we finally decided to try out the Chase patio for drinks. 

This place was great! We were greeted when you walk in by two lovely ladies who direct you to the elevator. Once the elevator doors open on the 5th floor, we were once again greeted by two lovely people. They took us to the patio outside and seated us. My partner had red wine and I had a vodka cocktail. Their drinks are very simple in terms of names: \"Vodka\", \"Gin\", \"Rum\" etc. Makes for easy ordering.

The drink was great. It had a piece of dragon fruit in it and candied fruit on a cocktail stick across the top. It was also very pretty - pink!

The decor is great - it feels really upscale. The patio furniture is amazing and comfortable and the staff was very friendly. Will definitely be back for dinner some time!"}
{"text":"I thought I would try this restaurant after reading a review in Toronto life.  Big mistake.  Although it was a not busy Monday afternoon I was virtually ignored by the wait staff who fawned over the suits and a table of prom girls no doubt being paid for by daddy.  I was never even given a menu!!  So after I had drunk my bottle of sparking water and my $16 glass of Chardonnay with still no waitress to be seen I got up and left.  I guess they could care less about a middle aged queen not in Armani or sporting a Rolex.  Thanks for the free cocktails though."}
{"text":"I've been to The Chase about two times. Both times service was great. The atmosphere itself was also very good. They have cute decor and a great set up. I have to  definitely recommend both the rooftop and the ground level patio. Both are in sun and great for a drink and a tan. The food itself is good. The first time I went I had the caesar, which is my usual drink order in addition to the mussel bowl. I was not disappointed with both. The broth for the mussels was perfect and my caesar came with a delightful large prawn. The second time I was there for a lunch affair during work hours and ordered the fried chicken. I found it had too much batter and not enough chicken, and that the accompany coleslaw could have been marinated a tad longer to soak in more of the oil and vinegrette flavour. Overall however both times I left satisfied and happy. The only real complaint I would have is that some items on the menu can be pretty pricey. It's definitely an upscale seafood joint but worth a try. They recently opened Little Fin where you can get take out orders if you're interested in trying to food out but not paying a whole lot."}
{"text":"My friend decided to celebrate her birthday at \"The Chase\" (upstairs). The ambience is perfect for a date night; dimmed lights for an intimate and cozy feeling. 

Unfortunately, our party had to be split for the night as they couldn't accommodate our group (15 people). Apparently there was some miscommunication during the booking. 

Moving forward to the monthly menu, I found it hard to understand. Descriptions were very deceiving and photos posted on social media shows otherwise. For example, we ordered the \"venison\" which supposedly was paired with foie gras. Like most people, you would expect a slab of foie gras. On this night, when my boyfriend ordered this dish, he was left puzzled. We had to ask our waitress where the foie gras was present and was informed that it was actually the goat cheese lookalike substance on the plate which did not carry the taste at all (refer to following photos). Presentation overall was poor and the taste of food was mediocre. For an upscale restaurant that is highly ranked, I expected more.

What boggled my mind the most was the fact that they were unable to split the bill accordingly. Unless one person pays for the entire bill, they can only split the bill evenly. 

To summarize my whole experience, I feel that the entire restaurant needs changes. From beginning to end, the experience just wasn't satisfying. I won't be fine dining here, but I'll gladly drop by the oyster bar downstairs (stay tuned for future review)."}
{"text":"It really pains me to give such a low rating, but really, I have experienced better at The Chase. I genuinely believe, though, that it was that particular night and the main server that we got that made the evening's service less than stellar.

Food, on the other hand, was just as delicious and tasty as I remembered so at least there was that.

Four of us had reservations for 7:30, Friday evening. We decided to valet park and the guy, who was dressed in some Parks and Rec gear, asked if we wanted to pay now or later. Not the first question you ask patrons at a \"fine dining\" establishment. 

Check-in was very pleasant. The gentleman host on The Chase level floor was fantastic - all smiles and personable. He said we had a great table and walking towards it, all waiters stopped to say hello. After that, the evening turned weird is all I can say. 

Our main waiter was cordial, but that was it. He clearly favoured the table beside us...talking at great lengths with them, laughing, and spending a disproportionate time there. I noticed when he finished talking with them, he would quickly scan his tables and rush to do this and do that. Nothing against being personable and friendly, but don't forget your other tables. Water glasses would be unfilled. We felt like we had to always hunt him down for things because he was too busy rushing (so that he could spend more time talking to his favorite table. The couple at that table were, however, very lovely:) 

Also, I ordered a lovely bottle of Brunello (which we had to wait a while for) and which did not have time AT ALL to decant. Our waiter basically rushed to open it, poured the wine into a decanter, and then, poured it into our wine glasses. What a horrible way to treat a $175 bottle of wine. Why bother even pouring it into the decanter at all?

Our table ordered 2 dozen oysters (fresh, fresh), the Octopus (okay) and Watermelon Salad (so yummy, refreshing, and light) for apps. After, our table ordered the Dish for Two: The Halibut (YUMMMMM), and the Steak (perfectly cooked at medium rare). Just a word of caution, the portions...even for two, are huge. The table beside us said they couldn't finish the fish...and neither could we. All that to say, we got to take home excellent food for next day.

The focaccia bread was very yummy (but came after our second order of oysters...) When our mains arrived, we asked for a second order to mop up the lovely steak juices...but it never came. I had to ask at the end to be packed up. We had ordered sparkling water, but my husband's glass was filled with plain. Service was, disjointed and chaotic, which I wasn't expecting, but could feel and sense as a dinner guest.

For the prices you pay and what the restaurant passes itself to be (fine dining, hot spot of the city, etc...), it was a let down considering I had such a fantastic time the first time I came here (and it was during busy TIFF season to boot!) With so many new restaurants and familiar favorites in Toronto, I don't think I will be coming back here anytime soon for dinner. Maybe drinks as the bar is quite nice and in the summer I bet that patio is packed, packed, packed.

Delicious, professionally-cooked, unpretentious food. Off-the-street and hurried service."}
{"text":"Dinner

Ambience: 4/5
Food: 3.5
Service: 4/5 
Value: 3/5
Repeat: unlikely

Notes: The staff forewarned us that service might be slow over the holiday weekend, and it was. But they were gracious, obliging and friendly to make the accommodations requested by our party."}
{"text":"Love the Poke for starters, had the Yonge Platter and the tuna was out of this world!! Pretty decent experience with the restaurant and staff, a bit pricey, but it is expected with establishments in that part of the city. It would be awesome if there was a few more selections on the menu, it doesn't have to be much, maybe 4-5 more items."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for biz last week. I took a customer to The Chase one night for dinner. WOW! This place is not only ultra-swanky, the food is amazing.  We had the Foie stuffed young chicken and was it good. Wine list is great, service was top notch.   I'd go back again in a minute."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this spot. As a restaurant participating in Winterlicious/Summerlicious, I find that they don't skimp out on the quality of their dishes. The atmosphere and decor is nice too. They have a bar/oyster bar area too where some people were eating their meals. Make sure you make reservations!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to start with this review. My girlfriend and I went to The Chase for dinner for her birthday. From the moment you are greeted at the door the atmosphere was posh yet inviting. 

We were given two different starters before we even looked at the menu. Both the bite size ginger cracker with pickled pear and fennel/turnip cream and the bread with some kind of sweets syrup on top were orgasmic! I haven't eaten bread in years and I devoured everything that was in front of me. 

Next came the avocado roll stuffed with shrimp, oyster platter with homemade cocktail sauce, the the pearl platter with various oysters, shrimp, lobster, salmon and tuna. All were simply extraordinary!! Every time we took a bite we sat back in our chairs and savoured every morsel. Everything we had such complex layering flavours that we took our time loosing ourselves in the experience.

Then they served the birthday girl the most amazing birthday cake! I think we moaned a little as we are it.

On top of it all the service was great and the view of the city was breathtaking. Yes it is a little pricy but it is completely worth it! It is the best meal I have had in the city so far. Definitely a place to come on a date or bring out of town guests. My hats off to the chef...genius!"}
{"text":"Their bread is SO good. The dinner loaf comes with truffle butter... but when we were there for lunch our server gave it to us on the side cause she overheard us talking about it. 

I really like the cod, and the halibut is usually my second favourite. 

We were also offered oysters (daily special) that day for $4 each - tasty also!

Amazing service and great food, I'd recommend to those looking for good seafood!

Was pricey - but you get good food, service and nice atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Love their endless oyster Mondays, delicious lobster rolls as well, would definitely return!"}
{"text":"The worst experience ever.. went here only for a drink. we went on a Sunday and were told that the patio (upstairs) is closed but if we wanted to sit outside we could (on the street level).

we were seated outside, and the hostess brought us water and we were forgotten about.

20 minutes later as we were getting up to leave someone comes out and asks if we were helped and we said no we were forgotten about so we decided to leave. the server said \"oh well that's too bad, have a good night\"

definitely not retuning here. thanks for the complimentary water."}
{"text":"Just left there. Holy.... Exceptional. Everything was amazing, fresh and tasty. Had the platter to start with crab, oyster, shrimp, tuna and octopus. Then the king crab pasta which may be the best pasta I've had ever in Toronto. To finish, the key lime pie in a big marshmallow. Phenomenal. I wish I remembered our servers name, she was awesome too."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner and outside on the patio for drinks. 

First a review on the restaurant

The service is top notch as expected of a restaurant of this calibre and price range. The food is very good and the menu has a bit of something for everyone. The flatbread appetizers were very good as well as the ribeye steak. The steak was perfectly done. 

The restaurant is located on the top floor of the building and is not cheap so expect to see folks with an expense account or the well to do who can actually afford the prices they charge. 

Outside patio bar

The patio bar is located on the top floor of the restaurant and has a small outside patio. There is not much of a view as the building is the equivalent of 4 stories high, but is surrounded by tall office towers. On week nights, expect to see financial district office workers there having drinks. Lots of drinks and beers available although they ran out of one particular Belgium beer our group was drinking one night we were there."}
{"text":"The decor is nice with high ceilings, friendly service and even free coat checking.  However, I think the food was just overpriced for slightly above average tasting food.
The soup of the day was ok, but for $12 soup I would expect to be more impressed with it.  The oysters we had were fresh and chucked cleanly, I liked the variety we got to sample.  I also ordered the lobster Roll, which was also ok, but was a very small size for the price $27.  I would advise to go to Rock Lobster for a roll of similar size for half the price and more taste."}
{"text":"The Chase is definitely one of our favourite place to go for a worthy seafood platter tower ($135 for the tower) thats in the core of Toronto and a great semi casual atmosphere but still sophisticated. Their menu is different between their downstairs and upstairs seating (upstairs is more formal). We normally order a Bay Platter + 2 sides and enjoy great wine with; the portion is just right for us. However given the price of the platter, its still very reasonable to order another main to share for two. We also tried their Monday's special of Endless Oysters $30 per person; I did this with my siblings and it was well worth it. However don't expect them to come really really quick especially later into the night when the restaurant become more busy. I highly recommend going early around 5:30 - 6pm if you want to try their Monday Endless Oysters; I personally also think going in smaller parties is better so that oysters ordered can be shared better rather than with big parties and it obviously will take longer for them to shuck 10 dozen for 10 people compared to 2 - 4 people. Parking is definitely not friendly or easy unless you pay for valet."}
{"text":"Delicious! The highlight was definitely the scallop with foie gras and the most amazing brioche. Chowder, and lobster claw dish were great as well. Baked clam dish good but came to table a little cold. We were seated at the hightop tables near the bar but popped upstairs for a look afterwards. It's got to be one of the most gorgeous/classy places to eat in Toronto  - if we decide to splurge again we'd definitely plan ahead and book reservations up there.

Now I took off a star simply because of pricing. Yes quality and especially seafood do not come cheap in increasingly exorbitant Toronto - but even by those standards The Chase is pushing it. The scallop dish - literally ONE scallop. It just seems chintzy when you are charging $21. And lucky we asked about the stone crab price before ordering because it was $19.50 PER CLAW! If we had ordered a plate as planned, one of us literally could have flown to Miami and ate them there at Joe's Stone Crab for the same price - flight and meal (we stuffed ourselves there 2 years ago with claws and drinks the bill was about $120....it literally would have been over $400 here!)"}
{"text":"Went for a friend's birthday dinner and they had set us up in the corner of the restaurant, which was good as it gave us plenty of space for pictures. The restaurant was beautiful but it can get very loud at dinner time (which is expected for a popular restaurant). Atmosphere was great, a lot of young people and the waiters/waitresses were all young as well. It can be a bit dim, but Highly recommend if you want to go for a more romantic experience. 

We all had a set menu for $55, which came with an appetizer, entree and dessert. I ordered the Clam Chowder (appetizer), Fish and Chips (entree) and the key lime cake (dessert). They actually put the birthday girls name on the menu which I thought was cool. 

What was good? 
- clam chowder was delicious, although I did eat a few raw pieces of onion in the soup (preferred to have it cooked more for a soup), but the flavour was great. It includes a couple of clams in there, and a few pieces of perfectly cooked cod on top of the soup.

- the key lime cake was very interesting, and it tasted unique. It was basically a large marshmallow \"cake\" and they had a key lime sauce beside it ( which was light and perfect with the cake)

What was bad?
- fish and chips were okay. I was expecting to have fries, but was given wedges though they were pretty good. The actual fish was cod, and the batter was okay. Was kind of tasteless and bland, but nicely cooked. 
- very overpriced I feel? Never been there to have their regular items from the menu, but the set menu I felt was too much. I ordered this and a beer and my total bill was $88."}
{"text":"Great, fresh look. Visiting in the city and stopped in with a friend before taking in a show on a Saturday evening. It was early so we didn't have any issues being seated. Very nice interior. We were just having a small bite, but everything was very tasty. I'm vegetarian, so I'm not the target audience, but my friend had a raw oyster selection and the arctic char and enjoyed them both. I had a salad and the chef was very accommodating providing me with the sides of the featured special, chick pea patties on a bed of cous cous. We also got a side of shoestring fries that seemed NOT from frozen and very tasty. It was all very good. Great and interesting wine list, with international as well as Canadian wines. Very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"From the outside, the Chase seems like most Toronto restaurants: tasteful decor, quaint atmosphere, even a live musician! Then you take the elevator up and it's like a whole different restaurant. Let me first point out: this place isn't cheap; you're probably looking any where from $70 to $100 pp.  But is it worth it? 

When you step off the elevator, the atmosphere goes from quaint and relaxed to high end. There's no dress code or anything but I felt underdressed with my polo and slacks. The servers here are well-trained and aren't some high school students looking for summer employment; these were professionals who took care of you. We started with delicious in-house baked bread (which came with its own recipe), followed by both fresh and baked oysters. We shared entrées which consisted of the lamb, halibut, chicken and sword fish - all were expertly prepared and delicious. 

As you can probably guess, I had a great time. The food was all very impressive, the service spectacular, and the overall experience was memorable.  It's a perfect \"celebrate anniversary\" place or a \"look how much I'll spend on you\" date place (if you're still trying to impress). Is it expensive? Yes.  Is the dining experience exceptional? Yes. You pay good money for good food/service.   And in my books, that justifies the price."}
{"text":"We had a private function here -about 100 people. Everything went well. The food was fantastic and the service was great. It was very well organized and they accommodated our last minute requests as well. My guests were so happy they were thinking of returning for dinner someday. I would definitely hold a private party there."}
{"text":"TL:DR - This joint is romantic AF. Music selection is on point. Food is either a home run or kinda meh. Beware of whole lobsters. 4 star overall.

This past weekend we (being my lady and I) were having a romantic weekend away (in the city - so more of a romantic weekend... of stay) and wanted to find a \"fancy\" place with a romantic vibe that wouldn't be too crazy on a Friday night.

Being the planner that I am, I poured through several publications (both in print and online) who'd made lists on most the romantic/best ambience/date spots in the 6ix. I found several options that I liked but none stood out to me like The Chase Fish & Oyster. So we booked it! At the time of booking, I made a note that this was a \"special occasion\" dinner so I wanted a good table if there was one available.

Our reservation was for 8:15 pm and we arrived right on time. The entrance is on the side of the building down an alleyway and you need to pass not one but two hostess stands before you're seated (seemed redundant but without them, you'd likely struggle to find the entrance entirely).

The restaurant is beautifully decorated and laid out, sophisticated and sleek with enough of a casual sea shanty vibe to make it not super stuffy. The main bar is shaped like a set of rolling waves and they carry you down to the main dining room which is sunken down several steps. The dining room also leads out to the patio but the real beauty, in my opinion, is the dining room. As you look up they've arranged soft hanging bulbs at various heights which give the appearance of a starry night sky against the dark ceiling.

We were walked into the dining area and given a choice of seats, either a private cosy corner booth which allowed us to sit at 45 degrees from each other or a two-seater. We went with the corner seat but it was really nice to have a choice.

Once seated we wasted little time ordering drinks and food. Here is what we had and my thoughts:

COD TACOS - warm tortilla, smoked tomatillo & lime sour cream
$6.25/pc
**I didn't eat this but my fiancee did and said she really liked this (4-star)

CRAB TATER-TOTS - Dungeness crab, charred scallion & cheese curds
$23.95
**You think this is going to be like crab-cake based on the description, it's not. It's literally a massive pile of actual tater tots topped with a crab and cheese sauce (2.5 star - a lazy dish, very filling but not very good)

STEAMED MUSSELS - Creole butter, white wine & garlic
$25.95/lb
**The quality of the mussels here were fantastic. HUGE in size, great flavours, a healthy portion and a nice bite to the sauce (5-star)

WHOLE EAST COAST LOBSTER SPECIAL - 1lb or 2lb lobster Steamed with drawn butter served with cheddar biscuit, and coleslaw
MP ($55 at time of visit for 1lb)
**This was an odd experience. I pulled off the tail so I could get at the meat and with it came a flood of dark brown sludge which smelt horrid (I gagged), what's worse it the gelatinous sludge was wrapped all over the tail meat. I asked the server if this was normal or if the lobster maybe was off and she handled the situation well by whisking it away and taking it to the chef, but when she came back she said that it was cooked fine and the lobster was fresh according to the chef. They warmed the dish back up for me and I assume trimmed off parts of the tail meat that appeared unsavoury, what was left was less than half a tail in meat. The claws didn't provide much meat overall so for $55 I got less than 1/2 a tail, and two small claws.... and a smelly plate of brown liquid. I think the customer experience here could be improved with some set of expectations or at the very least explaining how to separate/eat lobster (1-star)

Dessert
BANANA SPLIT (for two!) -  Neapolitan ice cream, bourbon caramel, cherry toasted peanuts
$?? (don't recall - and not listed on their website)
**best banana split I've ever had... EVER. So many flavours and textures, it was like eating a banana split, creme brulee and a peanut buster parfait all in one - Like the best of DQ on a plate. (5-star).

From a food perspective I would say overall it's a 3-star overall, too many inconsistencies with dishes being either great or not. What puts them over the top is the customer service, design/decor, and ambience (which I forgot to mention was only made better by the amazing music selection playing all night - classic RnB, contemporary-pop hits, sultry tunes with seductive instrumentals AND ALL THE SADE you can listen to. You know when a restaurant plays \"Smooth Operator\" they're lookin' to help you get lucky that night ;)

I'd go back and try more menu items out, great date night spot, worth the money

{"text":"WOW, this place is packed with some serious everything. In a good way.

Warning: This place was LOUD during lunch rush.

The employees and the customers there were extremely well dressed.  Suits & dresses, oh my... My wife & I are in jeans and sweaters, with our newborn.  Not a problem!

Adima Tuna starter - Solid performer, I'd totally eat that again.

Beef tartar - Also very very good. Right up there with Jacobs.

Oysters on the half shell - one dozen - very very fresh! The Atlantic ones (I can't remember the specific type) were the best Atlantic ones I've had.

Beef tenderloin - My wife & father felt that it was up there with Jacobs.  I thought it was very good, but short of Jacobs.

Fries - Mmmm... nice aioli to accompany.

Service - Excellent.

I'd totally come back."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday, it was the all you can eat oysters, the service was slow, but the food tasted great, and the manager was amazing!! ;-)"}
{"text":"Service and venue makes The Chase happen.

Went for a nice dinner at another restaurant but decided out of the blue to try The Chase for drinks. We were welcomed by two hostesses who directed us to the elevator to the rooftop patio. Upon exiting the elevator we were greeted by another hostess who seated us immediately outside. Our waitress was there in seconds to greet us and was amazingly friendly.

We only had a glass of wine and a cocktail but found the atmosphere, the drinks, and the service to be fantastic. Prices are a little higher here (just under $50 for two drinks, tip, and taxes) but worth it.

Will be back to try the food."}
{"text":"great service and great atmosphere but so-so food. I'm not used to going to places like these so paying 50$ for one bite of fish was not my thang.."}
{"text":"Went for business lunch. 2 people, 1.5 apps (they accommodated a half portion of an app), 2 mains + 3 big bottles of sparkling (which they did not keep at the table so frankly have no idea if we actually drank 3) = $165 lunch with tip. Good but not outstanding food, combined with high price point makes for poor value. Very nice restaurant decor wise and very good service, so if you can expense a meal, go for it, otherwise, skip."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the most creatively intricate, meticulously prepared, and delicious food I have ever had! Amazing Arctic char, steak tartare, and frites. The atmosphere is great, with unique vibes in both the upstairs and downstairs dining areas. The staff is also knowledgeable and accommodating. Pricey but you have to go at least once!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Service was great and food was absolutely delicious. I don't usually rave about food like this but the crispy oysters and sweet corn orecchiette were just so good!! Definitely recommend this place and particularly those dishes to anyone. Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"We went to the Chase (the 5th floor restaurant) for my husband's birthday last night. I wanted to love it, and obviously knew it was going to be an expensive dinner, but I just didn't think it was worth it.

First off, I don't mind dropping $200 on dinner for the two of us for a special occasion, but I expect it to be worth it. There are several meals we have had this year at other high end restaurants spending the same or a bit more, which were better.

So we ordered the burrata and the king crab, and had the bread to start. The bread is amazing for sure so no complaints there. The burrata - let me say the burrata itself was probably the best I've had in terms of being a real burrata, as soon as you cut into it the creaminess oozes out. However, I just found the accompaniments didn't do anything to elevate the burrata - arugula salad, a little bit of artichoke and chili. It certainly wasn't bad, but at twice the price of the most expensive burrata I've had, it was just totally overpriced. 

My husband had the king crab which was very good. But again, compared to a lobster pasta he had a month ago, it wasn't better nor did it require the higher price tag. 

Maybe dessert would have been good, but at that point we figured we would just finish our drinks and call it a night. It is a beautiful restaurant, and maybe we just didn't order the right things, but at the end of the day, there's a lot of good food in Toronto, so I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here (downstairs at the \"The Chase Fish & Oyster\") last Friday night.  We were very disappointed with the service.  We were seated at around 8:00pm and placed our order a few minutes later.   By 8:50 our first course (oysters) had not yet arrived.   After some polite prodding, they finally arrived.  Having waited so long for the first course, we were happy things seemed to be back on track and expected the hot course to arrive shortly.  No such luck.  Time was ticking away.   At 9:30 I finally had to tell them to forget the main course and that we'd just pay for the oysters and drinks and leave (we had a babysitter who finished at 10pm).  A maitre'd implored us to stay and promised that our food was arriving shortly.  We agreed to stay and the hot course did arrive.   We wolfed it down with one eye on the clock.  It was a mixed experience.  The clam chowder  and brussel sprouts on toast were good, but the cod tacos and smoked whitefish were \"meh\" at best.

Overall, the food was mediocre given the hype that this place has received.  And the slow and bumbling service was inexcusable.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here. Food was very below average here. Flavours in the salmon tartare were not balanced. Fish did not taste fresh and gave me a stomach ache. Arctic char overcooked and lacked seasoning. It was matched with some kind of strange pear or something which didn't make sense on the plate or on the palate. Chocolate cake tasted like it was from a supermarket. Saw the lines from the paper that lined the muffin tray. Seriously?! Why participate in Winterlicious if you're going to treat your customers like that?"}
{"text":"Definitely on the higher spectrum of the $$$ range. The roof level seating and outside patio have beautiful views and the staff were quick and very attentive. I'd rate the overall food however with 3 stars. 

TUNA TARTARE (4 stars): Looked a bit unconventional. Had a large tortilla chip on top but it was delicious

BEEF TARTARE (5 stars): Best dish of the night. This tartare, along with the deep fried brioche, might've been the best beef tartare I've had ever. 

SEAFOOD PLATTER (4 stars): Not impressive but fish were very fresh and delicious.

HALF DOZEN OYSTER (3 stars): I prefer my oysters a bit more briny. These were very neutral. 

HALIBUT (4 stars): The picture with the full fish looked amazing and my whole table expected it to come out that way. The 2nd picture showed it deboned and therefore much smaller than what we expected. Even if the meat was accurate, it would've been much more satisfying eating it off the bone. However, the flavor of the sauce, mushroom, and fish were absolutely delicious.

ARCTIC CHAR (4 stars): The fish was prepared extremely well. Perfect sear on the skin with flavor throughout the fish. The other pieces, spinach and mushroom, were completely bland. 

SCALLOP (3 stars): Scallops were quite small yet prepared well with a nice sear. Wasn't a huge fan of the quinoa crisps. 

DESSERT (4 stars): The caramel ice cream and cookie/brownie bits were mouthwatering. Torched marshmellows added a weird texture but they were fine. 

I'd rate the overall food however with 3.5 stars.  Service was great though. They even included a complementary dessert for my father's birthday."}
{"text":"After visiting the downstairs Fish and Oyster house a few days earlier, I wanted to try the \"The Chase\" upstairs to compare / contrast experiences. The verdict is in - I prefer the Chase upstairs with better service, beautiful decor and broader selection of food options.

Good:

- Spectacular service. Everything was outstanding - the coat check, greeting hostess, the servers and all other table staff. Our server was just perfect - explained the menu, made suggestions and asked what we liked / didn't like about our experience. 

-  The restaurant is beautiful, surrounded by large windows (unfortunately a view of construction at this time), huge chandeliers, comfortable leather seating with a mix of table options. Perfect for a quiet date or even a large group. 

- If your two, I suggest asking for a window seat so you get away from the larger crowds / tables in the middle of the restaurant. Nice and quiet.

- Cocktail selections are very good.They do amazing things to a simple Vodka Cranberry. A few, but decent beer selections (Blanche du Chambly). As you would expect, a huge wine offering.

- Appetizers - Can't go wrong with the Oysters, usually 2-3 options / night. Like downstairs, the Octopus is a standout - but no Olive puree upstairs.

- You get a free pineapple / apple butter bread loaf as a starter - this is incredibly good. 

- Sides - We had the Gnocchi with carrots & mushrooms (about 6 pieces) and Brussels sprouts. Loved the sprouts, served huge chunks of lean bacon and sour cream. Gnocchi was good but the portion was rather small.

- Loved the Venison, Foie Gras and Parsnip entree. Venison cooked perfectly medium rare - so good. Venison is quickly becoming a fav. of mine.

- Deep Sea Bass was also cooked just right but a little small for the $50 price tag. Served on a bed of cabbage. A simple dish but great flavour.

- My choice for Dessert was an Apple Cheesecake ice cream sunday - OK but didn't blow me away.

Not Good... some minor things

- Not enough washrooms given the size of the restaurant. I had to wait a bit on my visit.

- Some options felt a little overpriced. 

I will return again at some point. Give it a try...

{"text":"surprised at the less than stellar review on this place here! The place is new and busy so I'm sure as they settle in with staff and the new team, things will only improve. 
That being said, I've had a great meal, service and experience dining there. I had the oysters, oyster po boy, chicken and the scallop tostadas. Everything was really delicious. My true rating would be a 4.5 rather than a 5 star. Service was a bit tardy once the dinner rush started but overall, an excellent meal and friendly, professional, well trained staff."}
{"text":"Don't fear the alleyway, there is a host there with a warm welcome when you get in the door. This is one snazzy place. Beautifully decorated with high ceilings and a calm vibe, The Chase has a whole team of servers keeping everyone comfortable and full. (Even the bathrooms are beautiful!)  

Let's get to the goods. It was freezing rain that day, so I was happy the Tomato Soup was on the Winterlicious menu and this soup was epic. It had shrimp, smoked bacon, sour cream and milk bread topped with monforte cheddar. Hearty! Each bite was different. It hit the spot after coming in from the cold.  

Keeping the comfort food vibe alive, I had the Littleneck Clam Linguine. The sauce was creamy and complimented the clams well. The crispy squid had a little kick! A nice addition to a mellow dish. Pasta cooked to perfection and I couldn't finish it! I tried, I really tried!  

But, there's always room for dessert! Feeling like a big kid, I had the Root Beer Float. This dessert made my day. The big mug and the long spoon brought joy to my face and made me forget how full I was. The root beer with the chocolate sorbet topped with raspberries was fantastic. Chocolate and raspberries are always good together, who knew root beer would make them even better?! 

I've never had service the way they do it here. You literally had ALL of the servers and managers come by at some point, but somehow they all came for a reason, so they weren't pestering you. I liked it. I hate needing something and not being able to find my specific server or asking someone else trying to find them. You could ask anyone anything and feel comfortable as they were all my servers and they were all able to help. Refreshing! 

A great experience! I'd love to go back!"}
{"text":"Where do I even start? The appetizer, main, and dessert were absolutely phenomenal! Each dish had so many of my favourite flavours that we were about to order round 2! The service was also great, very kind and professional. I had the fries with Parmesan and truffle I believe, along with the steak and scallops, and forgot the name of the desert but overall delish!"}
{"text":"I went to The Chase on friday night with a few girlfriends. My friends arrived late so I sat at the bar downstairs and had a perfectly mixed dirty martini and chatted with the friendly bartenders.  The downstairs was an oyster bar decorated with white and grey stone (not sure what type)  It wasn't too loud, but the vibe was lively. 

We dined upstairs in the more upscale room with white table cloth and chandeliers.

We shared several dishes. 

We had:
Appetizer 1 -  The avocado stuffed with crab -- this was good. A bit fishy. But I liked it, and the presentation was gorgeous. 

Appetiser 2 - The octopus salad -- this was fabulous. It was our favourite for sure. The octopus was grilled to perfection and spicy sausage gave this dish a nice kick. 

Entre 1 - Lobster pasta -- I don't love pasta dishes, as I feel I can make the same thing at home. This was no different. To me, the sauce tasted like it came out of a classico jar. But it was tasty none the less. 

Entre 2 The scallops -- This was a five star dish! The scallops came on a bed of quinoa with peas and just the right amount of a  fantastic creamy sauce.

The fresh baked foccacia bread they brought to the table was to die for!

The service upstairs was a bit slow, with waiters who walked by without stopping to see if we needed anything. It took over 5 minutes to get the attention of our server to pay the bill. But all in all it wasn't offensively bad, just not the greatest. 

We all had a lovely evening and agreed we would return to The Chase."}
{"text":"What an amazing meal and wonderful servers. This is our first time and we will be back. A simple dish of fish and chips or fresh pickerel is special at The Chase. Oysters are awesome and tuna nachos are devine. Thank you to Maddy and Jared for making our visit one to remember. We look forward to our next visit. PS. A banana split unlike anything I've seen before, amazing."}
{"text":"The service was awesome, the food delicious and the setting AMAZING!!!! I for one, having eaten in fine restaurants all over the globe, don't always believe you have to pay a fortune to indulge in a quality dining experience! Our server Anna was awesome and the overall experience was terrific but $800 terrific!?!?! Not sure about that.... We did it once....we'll look for other options next time. Nice evening all in all....."}
{"text":"Apparently the 2nd best rooftop patio in Toronto.

What a dissapointment! I was expecting a nice view, but when we got there and went up to the patio, all you see are buildings. The view stinks. Parking is also an issue for this place as it is downtown. You will have to either pay $20-25 for valet parking, or park on the street somewhere nearby and walk it.

The vibe you get when you enter and look around is - fancy. Everyone is dressed up. It's a nice spot to go to for a date, or an after-work snack & drinks, but if you are hungry and need a filling meal, this is NOT the place to be! The food portions are tiny, and the price tags are high.

I ordered the lamb, which was about $40. Honestly - It wasn't that great. It was more bone than meat, and I couldn't really enjoy it. I didn't want to use my hands and make a mess of it since you are suppose to be \"classy\" here.

I don't think this place is for me at this stage in my life. Maybe when I'm older and can appreciate food that is more about presentation than quality/quantity, I would like this place."}
{"text":"Had an incredible meal. Got the platter with fresh everything (lobster, crab, oysters, etc) everything was amazing. Wait staff also went above and beyond to ensure our night was perfect. Shrimp tacos on special that night were to die for."}
{"text":"I stopped by here on a Thursday night for a few drinks

Downstairs is their seafood/fish restaurant, upstairs appears to be more higher end.  The restaurant was still quite full on the lower floor and packed on the rooftop at 9pm.  Roof top is actually quite nice.  A good size, but the served tables take up a large portion.  I'm not sure how they'll restructure this in the winter as the bar is half in/half out.

Definitely a higher-end spot for drinks/dinner.  On a weekday you'll find your middle aged men and women, divorcees, gold diggers and suits filling up the bar.  Don't expect much from the bartenders, as it seemed like they had a sense of entitlement when serving you a drink.  I also asked for a whiskey sour for a friend and got some sort of weird concoction that took her a while to make (whiskey and lime juice would have sufficed).  

This place is essentially your Earl's but nicer and with more hype because it's new.  I'd do a business lunch here and maybe stop by for a drink on a Thursday, but that's it."}
{"text":"Chose to go here for Monday  endless oysters. Food was great obv oysters super fresh however the service not that great. Our server was nice enough I guess not rude or anything but definitely felt like because me and my bf look pretty young (which were not, in our 30's) and we only ordered one other thing and wine besides the oysters, that we were kind of ignored. 
The wait time in between each plate was EXTREMELY long. In the time that other tables got 2-3 plates we got one and we're still waiting...
The server took the time to explain the different kinds of oysters etc to the older couple beside us but just plopped the plate down for us and said nothing. 
We were there for a total of 2 and a half hours and had to ask for our bill twice just because we wanted to leave. 
I realize it was also extremely busy and the holiday season perhaps but we definitely were there for wayyyy too long (I got a parking ticket) and felt like we were not as \"important\" as other patrons. 
I won't be going back."}
{"text":"My new favourite restaurant in Toronto Fresh. Perfect seafood. No hiding behind rich sauces. Total transparency. The quality of the seafood is front and centre. Great wine list. Cocktails prepared expertly. Not inexpensive but you could easily pay one half the price to have food that is not even 1/10th as good. If you have a special occasion or want to treat yourself or someone special - this is the place.  Service friendly efficient and extremely professional. Highly recommended. Pearl platter and halibut for 2 were highlights."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The first time was on a Sunday. The server recommended the clam bake. It wasn't very good and wasn't that big. However, the fried chicken was very good. Service was a bit slow but good. Will I go back? Not sure."}
{"text":"We had a cocktail and appetizer upstairs on the terrace. Gorgeous view and great way to kick off an evening. Went for dinner downstairs in the Fish and Seafood restaurant. Shared the Serrano ham flat bread,crab toast, octopus and fried chicken. All we're delicious and served quickly. Particular stand out was the octopus. All dishes were generously portioned.

Service was great, and attentive from more than just our server. The staff seemed genuinely interested that we felt good and enjoyed the restaurant. 

Our only complaint was the desserts. We tried a key line cake/meringue and a blueberry tart. Both we're underwhelming and too heavy after such a rich meal.

Cocktails and wine are pricey. The expectation is there for the seafood menu and understandably the dishes aren't modestly prices. Just wish there were more 'cheap and cheerful' liquor options.

Fun night out and I can't wait to go back to try other delicacies on the menu!"}
{"text":"The chase is awesome, wonderful location, excellent service and food! We were waiting for a few friends when we reach there, so we were served with the complimentary bread, which was so delicious that I find myself eating one after another. They even provide the recipe to this bread, not sure if anyone had any success with it! 

We had beef tartare and mussels as appetizers which tasted wonderful but the highlight was the foie gras stuffed whole chicken with seasonal veggie. It is supposedly for two, but for a group of 4, we were more than full, perhaps it was the few loaf of complimentary bread that we ate. The chicken was flavorful, and stuffed with A LOT of foie gras, they show you the whole chicken before they slice it up to serve which was a nice touch. 

Lastly we ended our meal with the lime angel food cake with coconut cream which was light, fluffy and refreshing. We were all very stuffed, like the chicken, by the end of the meal! It was a rainy night, and none of us was prepare for it, but The Chase gave out complimentary umbrella for us (and other people who wasn't prepared) which was a life saver, again, wonderful service and very detail-oriented!"}
{"text":"The Chase was actually quite good when it first opened, but it has gone downhill quickly.  The menu has been modified, and I can't imagine that it is the same chef as when it first opened.  My last two visits there were not just bad food, but the service was horrendous.  The staff are clueless, and seated me at two wrong tables for a lunch meeting before the party I was meeting (whom I did not previously know, therefore could not recognize) figured that I must be the person that they're looking for.  Overall, it was a painful experience between the staff and the lousy food.  It's a great venue, and it's rather unfortunate that the food has gone downhill.  Unless the owner changes out the chef pronto, this restaurant will ultimately fail."}
{"text":"Went on a friday evening, had high hopes given the great reviews. 
Food: 8/10 - tuna nachos, oysters (best), steamed bc mussles. 
Atmosohere - 7/10 - poorly lit we washrooms, great live music
Service - friendly but not very knowledgeable staff. Had to hut them down."}
{"text":"The chase was an amazing restaurant. I had the beef tartare for an app, the snow crab linguini as a main and a honey dessert. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Beef tartar on a patio overlooking the city lights with a beer in hand never looked so good to me. I work across the street from Chase, and was not disappointed when I entered the super hip and modern restaurants fifth floor patio. I can't wait to come back and try out more dishes."}
{"text":"Very mixed review.

Food:  

Very good.  As others have mentioned, a bit small portions for the price, but very high quality.  We split the Bay platter and a small loaf of bread.  Odd that you have to pay for bread at this restaurant.  I feel that when you're ordering a $110 seafood platter, you should leave full, and not have to order bread from a hunger point of view.

Service: 

This is confusing because our main server was horrendous.  A bit of an attitude, seemed disinterested in us, 20 minutes between bringing us water and coming back for drink orders.  That happened over and over again.  HOWEVER: The rest of the staff seemed great.  Really friendly, explaining things, offering suggestions.

Ambience: 

This is where things really took a dive.  The music was WAY too loud.  We asked them to turn it down several times and they did, but it always got turned back up.  It was club music too.  Who wants to enjoy a nice seafood dinner when the restaurant is rattling from the bass (not fish) and you can't hear the server or your dining companion?

I don't get it.  When was the last time anyone said \"Gee, the food here is great, but the music just isn't loud enough!\"

Probably won't go back, which is unfortunate.  But there are too many nice restaurants in Toronto to waste time in a place you don't enjoy, no matter how good the food is."}
{"text":"Oh, how I LOOOOVE this place. 

AMBIENCE - 5/5
LOCATION - 4/5 (The entrance is sort of confusing)
SERVICE - 5/5
FOOD - 6/5

I was beyond impressed. Definitely coming back again. I've urged almost everyone I know to dine here, one of the best restaurants in Toronto at the moment."}
{"text":"The Chase Fish & Oyster House is such a lovely restaurant located below the chase. The food was fresh and fantastic. However the service was awful which will overshadow what was a lovely meal.  If you feel like be neglected by a server this is the place to go. For a fine dining restaurant and a well known hospitality group I would expect a better dining experience.  I would recommend John & Son oysters well above the Chase."}
{"text":"We started with drinks on the upstairs patio and enjoyed talking to the friendly bartender.  Dinner itself was excellent.  The table shared tartare that was a big hit.  I am not an octopus fan but my friends enjoyed the generous portion.  My avocado wrapped around Dungeness crab was a beautiful presentation but only tasted ok so I wouldn't order again.  The cod was amazing!  I loved it and we ordered each of the sides.  Mushrooms were my favorite, although the truffle mayo made the fries a very close second. All the sides were good.  The only oddball thing of the night is that I asked for the bill and handed the waitress my credit card.  When she returned she handed it back to the oldest looking man in my party.  It was a business dinner and I was the only women with 4 men so maybe it threw her for a loop but it was a little awkward."}
{"text":"This was a nice discovery in the heart of downtown.  Try to get seating on the top floor.  You'll need to take an elevator.  They also have a nice rooftop in the summer.

The wine selection was abundant and had some decent selections.  The food was great, especially the seafood.  

I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This review is for The Chase Fish and Oyster. I enjoyed the service and ambiance, but wasn't too impressed with the food.

Ordered:

Asparagus - nicely roasted, but too salty
Lobster roll - roll was a bit too sweet and dense for my liking (more of a brioche)
Clam chowder - comes with a dropper bottle of rum, which you are supposed to mix in. This was one of the best dishes of the night. Would order this again
Oyster po boy sliders - these were nicely done. Would order this again.
Octopus - there was quite a bit of lobster on the plate and very filling. But I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce it came in.
Pork rib taco - too much bbq sauce! Didn't enjoy this.
Shrimp and grits - this is categorized under the 'large' plates but there really isn't all that much food in the dish. There were about 7 small shrimps. I liked the flavour of this dish though!
Key lime angel cake for dessert - this was probably the highlight of the night. Angel cake with key lime layers all coated in a marshmallowy fluff. And with toasted coconut on the side. It was very sweet, and portion big, so I would recommend sharing this.

Overall, I found the food in general to be too salty/seasoned in that the sauces overpowered the food flavours."}
{"text":"We came to Toronto for a convention from Washington, DC.   I wanted to have good sea food, and found the Chase Fish & Oyster in Yelp with number of good reviews.  When we arrive at the Chase, we thought we were under dressed but that was not an issue.  We liked the decor.

Service and Food:  EXCELLENT!!  Kelcie Jones was our server (I want to call her a Food Adviser)  Kelcie knew good foods, and she is super friendly, can give you the best recommendations.  I asked her which raw oysters she would recommend, and she told me St. Simone and Foxley Bay were good.  Those were one of the best I ever had.   Kelcie also gave me excellent pick for red wine.  I also liked Albacore Caesar and Oyster Po Boy Slider.  My friend had Lobster Potato Salad which he said excellent.  He also had a Burger that was also great!  (He does not eat fish)

For the attentive and knowledgeable service alone, I would definitely go back to the Chase Fish & Oyster next time in Toronto.  Please seat me at a table where Kelcie serves!  

Thank you, the Chase Fish & Oyster and Kelcie!!"}
{"text":"I love the Chase Fish & Oyster.  I've only eaten downstairs, but I have had a drink at the more upscale top level as well.

What makes the downstairs resto so nice is the right mix of ambiance, service, and delicious tasting food.  The oyster's are fresh, and delicious.  The pan roasted scallops tasty, the lobster sweet, halibut tender, and the desserts to die for.  You don't feel claustrophobic in the place, because of the high ceilings, and the spaciousness of the restaurant.  Warm earth colours help you relax and forget about the money you are spending.  Finally the service is outstanding.  There is always someone there to take your order, clean up, refill, and offer suggestions about what to try.  

Lastly, the Chase's foccacia bread is a must to eat. It is delicious and addictive!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Review is strictly for their winterlicious menu.

Came in for lunch with a couple of co-workers to try their winterlicious menu. Tucked in on Temperence is this really cute restaurant. Glass window from floor to ceiling with a cute nautical theme inside the restaurant. The restaurant itself is not too big - with a bar section and a dining area. Servers are all dressed quite casual and are also super friendly.

For winterlicious, I tried the shrimp louie salad (A head of iceberg lettuce with some cocktail shrimps and dried cranberry with thousand island sauce) . The app itself was only ok... lots of lettuce and lots of thousand island sauce. For main, we got the seafood linguine with clams and deep fried calamari. The dish was very buttery and tasty. The sauce itself was not overly salty and the pasta was cooked to perfection (al dente). A great dish that I could potentially order on their regular menu again.  Lastly, for dessert I opted for the root beer float. It was a cute concept but it was simple and mediocre. Nothing overly special. Overall, Service was great but winterlicious menu (like most winterlicious menu) was only mediocre at best. I definitely would like to come back to check out their regular menu and have their oysters though!"}
{"text":"Had dinner upstairs during primetime on a Saturday night. Got a table right buy the service pass (d'oh!) so got to listen to the kitchen staff communicating all night. The place was packed, so I can't really complain, but I will anyways.

Food was good - had the octopus app, and the veal main. Both were good. Restaurant is nice. Service was also pretty good.

So, as the rating suggests, A-Ok."}
{"text":"Went to the upstairs location for a work lunch, and food was amazing. 
We had the scallops and it was done just perfect! 
Ambiance is great, it's like a hidden gem in busy downtown.
Really enjoyed myself here. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch recently. Happy with the room, service and food. Had the burrata ($23) to start followed by the halibut ($38). Both were very good as they should be at that price point. My guest had the soup ($15) and the chicken ($27) and seemed pleased with both. 
Not cheap but a great place for a business lunch."}
{"text":"Food was good. Portion size was ok. Great atmosphere. Lobster bisque could have used more flavour and the donut dessert was decent. I give it an overall 3.5. Wine prices could have been more reasonable. 20 dollars for 6oz of red wine is sort of ridiculous. But the wine and was flavourful."}
{"text":"I came here again and I wasn't as impressed with my experience as the first time. Service is still very good, but I did not enjoy the food as much as I did the first time. The complimentary bread was a little bland and too crispy. I had the burger and asked for it to be cooked medium, but it was still very dry and not seasoned very well. The fries almost tasted stale! My friend had the steamed mussels, which she enjoyed. The desserts did not wow us. I had the chocolate sundae and my friend had the fried apple pie. We would both pass on them."}
{"text":"The Chase Fish & Oyster is a great place for lunch or dinner if you like seafood in a historic building downtown Toronto. The atmosphere is upscale. 

The food can be hit or miss. I really enjoyed the halibut, but the starter salad was nothing to write home about.  Having said that, I know that my colleagues have enjoyed other dishes here that are also quite good. 

The service is great. It is what you would expect at a upscale downtown restaurant."}
{"text":"Note: this review is for their Winterlicious menu however, I have been here during their regular menu and I'd rate it a 3.5 out of 5.

Started with the salmon tartare and I loved it - it was probably my fav part of the 3 courses (although my cab sauv was pretty fab too). 

Entree was the Atlantic char and although it was also really nice, my friend got the braised ribs that I contemplated and eventually tried and they definitely tasted better. 

And finally got the donut, which was also really nice but I thought it could have been a little more fresh/warm. 

I don't know if I've ever seen any of these options of their regular menu and I typically find myself at The Chase for work events and I always enjoy my meals here. So, I definitely recommend this spot -- especially for the wine list/cocktails after work. 

Also note: they have $20 valet available"}
{"text":"I came here with my friends earlier tonight for winterlicious after reading so many great reviews about this place! And I'm so glad we came! The entrance is a little tricky to get into, it's actually at the side in the alleyway!

We had a super nice server who kindly gave us his recommendations (he said get the donut for dessert). I ordered the salmon tartar with three small pieces of bread and that was really good, I found the beet relish paired quite well with the tartar. For main, I had the pan seared arctic char and I think this would have to be my favourite out of the whole meal. The skin was crispy and the fish wasn't dry at all. Highly recommend.

 Lastly, for dessert I had the chocolate cake with peanut  ice cream and little bits of popcorn. The chocolate cake didn't taste exactly like cake..more like a muffin or a cupcake kind of texture. I did like the ice cream though. One of the managers came by and asked how our desserts were, and my friends gave their opinion (we all had the chocolate cake except one friend). And the manager decided to give us a complimentary dessert (the donut) and thanked us for our feedback! The donut was great btw, it had apples and cinnamon inside..so yums!

Honestly, this is such a great place! I loved the service! It was excellent there was even one server who folded my friends napkin while she was in the washroom! Like wow! I'd definitely wanna visit here again especially for their oysters (drools)."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most overpriced disappointments in the city.  While the room is pretty spectacular, the food was mediocre at best and the service was horrible. 

One of our party had ordered a dish, and the fish was super dry and tasteless. So much so that it was only half eaten. We brought this up to the staff, who referred us to the manager. The manager stated that they had been getting a lot of negative feedback about that dish, and they plan to remove it from the menu in the near future. 

When we got the bill we noticed that the dish was not removed from it. We again spoke to the manager, who said he would take care of us the next time we visited...pretty presumptive of him to think we would have a return visit..."}
{"text":"Came here based on yelp reviews and I was not disappointed. Sat at the bar and tried the Shrimp & Avacado \"Roll\" and oyster po'boys. Both were delicious!!! 

I wish I lived in Toronto I would be in here more often!!"}
{"text":"We went to the ground floor, more casual dining for lunch. My friend ordered the Oyster Rockefeller, I never in my life had Oyster Rockefeller so tiny and watery. We ordered the clam chowder, again it was all water down. 

For my main I ordered the lobster roll, the bread didn't taste good, so I just end up eating the lobster salad.

The whole meal only the biscuit was half decent. Very disappointing experience for that price point and the quality of food. I don't think I will come back."}

Location - front door is in the alley close to the back where all the garbage are (2 star)

{"text":"We need more establishments like this in Toronto. On the newly renovated Temperance street with it's wide side walks, it seems like I've briefly entered another part of town, and could it even be Toronto? 

I haven't seen a restaurant promote themselves so forcefully before it even opened in the area of their key demographic (bay streeters with their significant others and colleagues), rapid social media and food truck samplers. I knew more about the restaurant before it even opened. 

The Chase Toronto (not to be confused with the Fish and Oyster) sits on the rooftop of the building, that has been built over into an enclosed space. The large windows lets in tons of natural light, and dims appropriately in the evening. There is a small balcony/patio that was full of folks having their after work Friday night drink. All tall, good looking men that probably work near by, if you're into that. 

It's one of those places that has tons of staff, and you expect then the service to be exceptional. They did not disappoint. 

Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the food, our water was never empty (important!) and he was very attentive in wiping the beer condensation from the table (should it not be served with coasters for this purpose?)

Food wise, the menu up here piques my interest more than downstairs. It is pricey. I would fully recommend a nice special occasion dinner here. You'll be looking at $30-50 per entree, but don't get me wrong, it's worth it - the food was exceptional. 

I got the Lamb Chops (with crispy lamb belly, lamb jus, and agnolotti and rapini) $44. It was a decent size, but best lamb I've had at a restaurant. There was a side of rapini puree, but I didn't think it really added anything to the dish personally. 

My husband (who wasn't too hungry) got the quali egg, ham and sweet corn flatbread ($21) . It's meant to share, but who says he cannot eat it all himself! It was also innovative and very tasty with a perfect crust. Filling as well. 

Pre dinner - we were given a loaf of fresh bread, with a recipe so I can attempt it at home. It was crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside - covered in Apricot butter. Best free bread ever. And as a non-wheat eater on most days, I indulged because it was worth it. 

With dinner and drinks, it was about $70-80 pp, but depends on what you order. Drink prices are also not that different from some of the other pubs in the area ($7 a pint, for example)

I would love to come here again one day, but curious if the menu will change seasonally as it's quite small. 

Great addition to the core, I wish yonge street itself could update it self to match this."}
{"text":"The food runner placed a lobster cracker and a small fork next to the regular cutlery beside my plate. I haven't eaten shellfish since I was 9 years old and the placement of such utensils wasn't going to make me start now. Luckily for me, the restaurant provided plenty of options of sea-dwelling creatures that roam above the bottom of the ocean. 

 Located on a quiet side street in the midst of Toronto's bustling downtown, near Yonge and Queen, sits The Chase Fish and Oyster Bar. This restaurant sits in a grand brickwork building, which also holds the fancier, sister restaurant, The Chase. Entering the dimly lit, nautical themed setting of The Chase Fish and Oyster Bar felt comforting and relaxing. I joined my dinner guests, which included my mother, father, sister, and godmother, and quickly noticed the candle sitting in the middle of the table which evoked an intimate atmosphere to our secluded booth in the restaurant. 

 Our waitress, Maddy, was friendly and bubbly as she guided us towards the family sharing menu which came at $60 per person for three appetizers, a seafood platter, a whole fish, and two desserts to share between the five of us. That same food runner who placed the culpable cutlery beside my plate also provided still water that mysteriously tasted like sparkling water. The mistake was quickly remedied by our incredible waitress who apologized profusely for the small mishap. The waitress remained attentive and accommodating the entire night with constant and sincere check ups on our dining experience, while also making sure the wine bottles quickly became empty over the course of the night. 

 The first dish of the night was the seafood platter which included oysters, shrimp, lobster, crab, smoked mussels, and tuna sashimi, brought to the table by a server who provided in-detail explanations of each item, including place of origin. My dinner mates informed me that the shellfish was divine and encapsulated the sort of flavours one would expect from dining on the East Coast, especially when accompanied by side sauces. I dug into the tuna sashimi, topped with green onion, sesame seeds, and carrots, which had a sesame oil and soya sauce marinade which graciously did not take away from the taste of the tuna. 

 Next to the table came the tuna \"nachos\", buffalo cauliflower, and crab tater-tots. This dish included a saffron and sweet onion emulsion that perfectly complemented the tuna sashimi. The nacho chips themselves were actually taro root crisps and added a nice crunch to the softness of the raw tuna. I sampled the buffalo cauliflower, which included a light amount of ranch sauce on top of the cauliflower, and although it was not my favourite, it was a nice alternative to the other seafood and fish focused dishes of the night. I did not try the crab and cheese tater-tots but my dinner mates were impressed with how the potato balanced out the strong flavours of the crab and the cheese. 

 Then came and went the waitress, Maddy, and other servers with our dirty plates, only to be back quite quickly with new ones. 

 The fish special was a whole seabream which was expertly deboned tableside. There was also sauteed spinach (drizzled with creme fraiche), mushrooms, and root vegetable rosti provided as a side to accompany the comparatively simple white fish. The softest, tastiest part of the fish was, by far, the cheek, of which the skin crackled satisfyingly in my mouth. That being said, there was no loss of flavour when indulging in the fish and the vegetables together in one bite.

 When our stomachs were bursting and the wine had been drank, the waitress came back to enquire as to when we wanted dessert. After informing her of our catatonic states, she kindly replied that she could hold out on serving our desserts for a little longer while we regained the strength we needed to indulge in one last bite that is the greatness of The Chase Fish and Oyster Bar. When dessert did come, it was a banana split and a honey pecan pie. The banana split included chocolate and vanilla ice cream placed on top of a caramelized banana. The caramelization, although unique, unfortunately did not make up for the unripe banana. However the chocolate and vanilla ice creams were decadent and lured me away from thoughts of the less than appealing banana. The honey pecan pie was quite sweet but nonetheless enjoyable. 

 Overall, I enjoyed the sharing platter because, as a table, we could share (most) of the exact same dishes which united us as one in the plethora of inviting flavours. 

 The Chase Fish and Oyster Bar succeeded in providing me with the commensal experience of sharing food it put forth on its menu."}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience at The Chase 

They were running a bit behind on our reservation. But they more than made up for it. The food was fantastic. Great flavours. Not over powered by salt (as you get in many restaurants). The new lobster dish is highly recommended.  The service was spot on. 

Will go back. And often if they keep it up."}
{"text":"Had an intricate dinner for 4, totaling 350$ including tax. Service for water from waiters was pretty attentive, and the waitress did seem to understand the menu. For 50$ for lobster, I expected more. The lobster was watery and not very flavourful. The octopus dish was overly favoured so you couldn't taste the actual seafood which was also disappointing. If this restaurant was half the price, I'd say it would be okay but not worth it for the price. Due to dietary restrictions I could only eat the one desert which ended up being very salty toffee. The manager told us there was sorbet as an option, however after asking to order it from the waitress was told it was unavailable. My friends said the chicken and waffles was good, and the Venison was okay, the salmon was under flavoured and passable. It's very unlikely I'll return to this restaurant. 

Pros: Saturday night has live music, and good atmosphere. Was also able to order off the Chase menu.

Cons: overpriced for the quality. Seating area felt cramped. Small desert menu. Very few non-alcoholic options."}
{"text":"A short elevator ride brought us to the 5th floor patio, a setting that was as sophisticated as it was fabulous. I loved the breathtaking feeling of dining high above the city & being surrounded by towering downtown buildings. 

Foods: 
- green & white asparagus: hollandaise was a touch sweet, but otherwise, a lovely side for sharing
- tagliatelle with king crab, sweet peppers, corn, & garlic butter: soft noodles didn't overpower the decent portion of mild, fresh crab; chef did well cooking pasta past al dente
- delicious strawberry basil drink 

The Chase was a wonderful introduction to Toronto's culinary landscape. I left impressed with the city's restaurant offerings, both in terms of food quality & ambience. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for their endless oysters and it definitely won't be my last. The service was great and servings of oyster were generous. 

Food: the endless oysters featured were malpeques. The oysters came with the usual garnishes. There was one sauce that was similar to a seafood cocktail sauce but the rest was your usual mignonette, hot sauce, horseradish, lemon. We also ordered the cheese biscuits in order to switch things up a bit and those were delicious with a nice sweet glaze on top. 

Service: they gave fresh bowls for the shells for every order replenished. We also didn't have to tell them how many oysters each time we wanted more. They just kept on bringing out trays and confirmed with us when we looked like we were about done. The waiter was very attentive and we promptly got everything we needed including refills on all the sauces.

Overall will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Four stars for the food, but minus one star for the price and the service. 

I came here with the hubs for date night. 
Gorgeous room, high ceilings and the noise level wasn't too bad. We had a reservation, and snagged a nice 2 top by the window.
Service was very slow. It took forever to order and forever to get each course, which can be nice, because it makes you take your time and enjoy eachother's company. But it's also annoying, as in, 'are they out fishing for our sturgeon, or what?'

We had the albacore tuna, it had a nice vinaigrette-style dressing on it. Presentation was really thoughtful in all the dishes, which is nice to see.

Sturgeon plate was really big, a bit salty but delicous. Really yummy. We shared some oysters and shrimp from the raw bar. Yum. We had a salad which had avocado in it, it was okay. Sort of bitter.
I had the fall chowder, it was loaded with clams (didn't see really any other seafood in there as promised) and not cream-based. Delish. It had a dollop or mascarpone on it which was just the perfect accompaniment.
Husband had the stuffed clams for his entree. I'm not really into stuffed clams, but it was 3-4 large clams, topped with a lot of stuffing. I tried it. Meh.
The star of the show was the sturgeon, although I don't like eating poor old sturgeon, it's sustainably fished so it was okay.
I drank a caesar, well done although didn't come with the promised smoked oyster on it. He had 2 glasses of wine.
The menu is designed as share plates and then entrees - but I found the share plates to be larger than your typical..and I hate eensy share plates so I find this an important point. You could technically order 2 share plates for yourself.
The bill? $250!!!! Holy CRAP!
My husband almost had a frigging heart attack...without even a bottle of wine..the price, contrary to what a reviewer had posted earlier, was ridiculous.
I would love to go back, but I work in healthcare so unfortch I have no expense account. Too bad."}
{"text":"Overall a fantastic restaurant experience. I particularly liked the ambiance from the moment I stepped off the elevator. The staff from hostess to server were very professional. My main course was the artic char. Outstanding! Portions are small so don't hesitate to order some appetizers. Because our meal took some time to arrive, they brought 3 desserts on the house. Banana dessert was 10/10."}
{"text":"You know you are starting to take the responsibility of writing Yelp reviews very seriously when you are kept awake at night by your mind having a heated debate about whether or not a restaurant is worthy of two or three stars. Wtf brain. 

But alas, The Chase, you have earned yourself the below average two stars.

This 2/3 star debacle carried on in my head, because I had trouble separating the charm of The Chase that was its high ceilings, fashionable yet still warm & welcoming air, roman-nautical decor, and sharply dressed staff..... that it disguised the  dissatisfaction of infant portioned, average tasting, and hence, overpriced food. This debate was settled when I truly thought about what my criteria is for judging these things....food above all else. 

The food:
- Oysters: Prefer oysters with a creamy taste so I went for the west coast BC Kusshi from BC and DC Shigoku. Ugh these were so good. But in all fairness, they don't take too much culinary skills to prepare 
- Lobster bouillabaisse: Closest thing you will get to a normal sized restaurant portion. I haven't had lobster bouillabaisse before so I can't compare it to others. In absolute terms, I'm not a fan...just tasted like boiled lobster in herbed soup?
- Albacore tuna grilled cheese: Basically, imagine one thin grilled cheese sandwich with tuna sashimi and slaw on top. Also not sure how this is valued at $24 when ingredients aren't particularly fresh/difficult to procure or prepare
- Pan roasted scallop: This $24 dish came with the very generous portion of...one scallop. One scallop on brioche that was a tad too sweet. I think I am just too turned off about paying $24 for one measly scallop and shred of foie gras on a sweetbread to say anything further.

So basically food is below average relative to the high price tags. The same can be said for the service. Our server did the minimum basics such as taking our order and answering questions that were asked, but did not seem pleased to be there. At all. I think he managed to get through the entire night without cracking a smile.  

I am not one to stinge on food, but I think you can get a lot more value for your money elsewhere. Sorry, The Chase Fish & Oyster...but as the saying goes, pun intended, there's plenty of other fish in the sea."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was superb - intimate but also accommodating for large groups. 

Shared the ribeye for two (it was a special - off menu selection).  Was cooked properly, good taste but slightly overpriced compared to other locations.  

The sides were excellent. 

Friends had the halibut for two, it looked phenomenal and the presentation was terrific.  

It is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant with an intimate setting. Their diamond seafood platter was very well assorted and very fresh. Entrees were very unique, tasty, and good portions. Service was very good."}
{"text":"we went in a group, and we had to order from a set menu ($100 p/p) but if you compared it with the exact items on the regular menu, depending on what you ordered, the set menu is $10-30 more then if you ordered each item separately, but because it was a group of 10+ people we must order from the set menu.
also when the bill came, there was a mandatory 20% tip added on, I wouldn't mind this if the service was good, but it was extremely slow, and servers were inexperience. 

the bread is nothing to rave about, its dry and needed butter on the inside not just the top crust, the crust at the top of very hard. some liked it, some didnt.

I have to agree with most people that the food is overpriced for what it is.
The king crab leg pasta had a few pieces of crab, probably not a full leg at all in the whole dish, they kept recommending it, but i feel like it was probably cause it's the most profitable for them.
the duck breast dish has the largest piece of duck breast i have ever seen, I didn't know ducks were that large? it was very chewy and hard to swallow.
the appetizers for the quality and price is not worth it either.
there was a choice of 2 cakes, key lime angel cake, which was just extremely sweet, the chocolate one was like a chocolate chip cookie/muffin with some chocolate inside and a scoop of ice cream. no one finished their desserts.

and to make it even worst, took the valet forever to bring us back our cars when we were leaving!"}
{"text":"Finally returned last night. Our server was such a sweetheart (forgot to get his name) and laughed at my date's bad jokes:) We kept it light beginning with a dozen oysters, half East and West. 

Then came two dishes that blew my mind. Generally now as a \"clean eater\" it's hard for me to enjoy too many flavours at once. But The Chase's chef's clearly appreciate and respect food.

The Arctic Char --pan roasted with kale, jerusalem artichoke purée, maitake mushrooms & pickled heirloom carrots--is easily one of the best fish dishes I've ever had. The flavours, temperatures, textures, acid ratio etc. is just perfect.

And the brussel sprouts--fried & served with whipped crème fraîche & whitefish caviar--is easily one of the best veggie side dishes I've ever had! The light frying means you can still taste the veg and of course, caviar is always divine.

Fingers crossed returning soon."}
{"text":"A colleague and I recently stopped by the Chase for dinner. I was very impressed by the restaurant, especially the decor and view. It has great ambiance and service was impeccable.

I thought the food was decent, but not amazing. For the prices, I expected more.  We started out with the salmon crudo and the avocado roll. For entrees we went with the spinach pasta and artic char. The wasabi was overpowering in the crudo dish and there were more mushrooms in the \"pasta\" dish than pasta. The waiter also pushed us to order the frites, which were nothing special - just the basic truffle fries you can get a lot of places.

Important note - they have no vegetarian food on their menu!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with customer friend on a weekday. Place was packed. Good location, bright, modern décor, big windows letting in natural light, with views of the surrounding sky line. My friend was running late so our server offered good salt crusted focaccia bread hot and fresh while I waited. Appetizer albacore tuna with hearts of palm in yuzu sauce $18 was very good. The main was seared scallops with ham hocks $29 - great combination who would have thought. 

My friend ordered the halibut but unfortunately it was over cooked. When our server came over we informed her and she handled the situation perfectly - provided a replacement option and approximate time 5-7 minutes for the new dish. Second one was perfect. 

I read the reviews on Yelp while I was waiting for my friend and I normally like reading the reviews that are 1 to 2 stars, they seem to be more interesting sometimes. Anyhow I read Andrew S review and of course human nature you automatically start looking at the negatives. So we did notice that at times the staff seem to be joking around just at the entrance to the kitchen - our table was right next to it. 

This is a new restaurant opened in August of 2013, the staff is just not tight and not completely on the ball. I had to ask for water a couple times. When the staff came over to fill up my glass he completely neglected to fill my friend's glass which was empty - seems odd since the glass was next to each other. Our server a few minutes later came to the rescue and filled his glass. 

So overall a good restaurant - with creative and good food, but when you are paying $100 for lunch without wine, you expect service to be tight. Again its a new restaurant and they will get there. Definitely worth a visit in the evening in the summer to enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"We went here for summerlicious as a recommendation from some sites online. The menu seemed promising, however the oyster salad was a little underwhelming and the mac and cheese was bland. The shrimp sandwich however was delicious! The atmosphere and staff was amazing, and it is in a very convenient location."}
{"text":"AMAZING. the tower special on tuesday is a steal. the roasted mushrooms are ridic, and spencer (bar tender/shucker) is the man. best meal in toronto we've had"}
{"text":"Their endless oysters Monday is great if you are a oysters lover. 45/person is still a good price."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. The food is slightly overpriced compared to some of Toronto's other great restaurants but overall still a great place to enjoy a nice dinner"}
{"text":"While looking for the next best restaurant in Toronto I found The Chase.  What a find!!! Not to be confused with the Chase Fish &Oyster.  Our waitress asked how did you find us, normally it is only locals who come here.  Good research, I stated.  We were fortunate, the weather was phenomenal and we got a table on the 5th floor rooftop.    I started with a selection of West Coast Oysters - OMG they were good.  The avocado stuffed with shrimp was a work of art that had mouth popping flavors.  The Black Cod was perfectly presented, tender and moist, also bursting with flavor. The side of Brussels sprouts cooked to perfection and tasted great.  No wonder The Chase was the best new restaurant in Toronto in 2013 with high acclaim in 2014.  Each dessert was impressive and tasty.  Our server was knowledgeable, guiding us through what to order. An extensive wine list was available.  The Chase also has hand crafted cocktails, which looked good, but I did not sample.  At the end of the meal, our server, Annie, who proved to be a real asset,  gave us a tour of the restaurant and we learned the Chase had an informal bar, and a more formal seating area, decorated in cool pleasing colors. It was a much larger restaurant than I originally thought. As we walked by the kitchen, it was clear these guys know what they are doing, efficient and well run.  Overall, this was a great find. Get a reservation - treat yourself and significant other to a good meal, with the freshest ingredients, in a convenient location with friendly helpful service."}
{"text":"AVOID this restaurant for Summerlicious dinner. 

They lull you in with a good appetizer then the main course comes in and wham.  You are asking what happen.... Did the chef became busy with too many orders.  Can't be when it was half empty and the place was small.  Nope no excuse.  Then dessert came in... If seems as if  noobee made it. 

First course appetizer 
Tomato ceviche 
* 8.5/10
* clean taste.  Interesting texture.  Teases the taste buds 

Shrimp and no grits
* 7.5/10
* shrimp slightly over cooked causing the shrimp texture to be off 
* sauce inconsistent flavor .  One plate it was spicy then no flavour at all while the 2nd plate the sauce was mixed well

Main course 
Creole lingcod
*5 to 6/10 
* fish. Was seared okay. Vegetable were okay.  The issue was the levels of spice.  

Note both of my friends can easily eat spicy food but when too much spice are added; it over power the flavour and kill your taste buds.  For that reason the low scoring and beginning of our down hill experience with this restaurant 

Chicken n waffle 
*6/10
* classic simple comfort dish where you can't mess up.  And if you do..... You can't hide it 
* my dish the chicken was bland.  Crispy and juicy but where's my salt.. ..  Number one rule is seasoning properly.  My fellow friend chicken was over seasoned.  So I'm guessing she got my salt... 

* the waffle was dry and felt like they made it in advance followed by microwave before serving.  Creating a soft non-crispy texture.  



Desert...

Strawberries short cake with lemon sorbet deconstructed. 

3/10

Who Ever decided to place a lemon sorbet over short cake should be smacked in the head.  Having the lemon melt into it... Is just wrong.  The flavour combination is mess up.  If you are aiming tartness to counter the strawberries sweetness which by the way... It wasn't sweet.  Then make strawberry sorbet with a small hint lemon.   


Peach cobbler 

4/10
* peaches and cakes portion was good.  The issue is.... You don't place a ice cream on top of it and let it sit for a LONG.... time in the kitchen.  By the time it got to to our table it was a melted mess.  Which I pointed out to our server but no.... Do I get a replacement. Nope. Just a lame excuse it because the peach cobbler is hot.  I gave her the look. 

Commons sense. If you plan to top ice cream on a hot food item you wait to the last moment before placing the scoop of ice cream and serve IMMEDIATELY"}
{"text":"A bit tricky to find-small street off Yonge and an entrance off to the side.   Once inside,  all my points if contacts from the Hostess to server was excellent.   Nice smiles,  very polite!   The food was very good,  decent portions.   We even got a double order of the Oyster Shots -  you don't want to miss this $7 value!   Nice presentation on the plate.   We ordered the beef brisket and fish which were both cooked perfectly!   We will be back to try many of the other dishes.   Decisions decisions."}
{"text":"Love this place! 

Brought my boyfriend here to celebrate him passing the CPA exam:). This restaurant definitely lived up to my expectation! Reserved a spot online at OpenTable and got a table on the 5th floor.

I ordered the octopus for appetizer and scallop risotto as a main dish. Taste pretty awesome! The Main dish took a while to come but the waitress was very attentive and kept following up for us. 

They gave us complimentary dessert at the end because of the long wait which is a plus!:)

Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The food here was delicous (we had the set menu), and the ambience was lovely (live music on Friday nights) but the service was terrible. We waited 1.5 hours for our first dish, and another hour for our dessert, which was just preprepared ice cream and pie. We had to go up to the bar to request they bring our food and check. Overall, we spent over three hours at the restaurant, despite it being not busy at all! We even saw the workers all hanging our chatting at the bar while we were waiting, which was a bit frustrating.

Tldr: 8/10 for food, 3/10 service, 6/10 overall"}
{"text":"This place has a great environment and not to mention good ambience and great service. I came here to celebrate my friend's birthday so we were a large group. Because of that, we were given a set menu to choose from. This included an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I ordered the fish tacos, the hen and the key lime pie for dessert. I also ordered a glass of their white wines.

The choices on the set menu I find were limited and we didn't get a chance to try the other great seafood items on the menu- what The Chase was known for. 

The good: Great service, friendly staff, good environment. The fish tacos were yummy, enough fish and sauce which was great at every bite.

The bad: The hen was a bit dry but it came with a BBQ sauce on the side so that helped. The key lime pie was a little too sweet for me but I enjoyed the first few bites. Overall, the food on the set menu was alright and it was quite expensive. I think what was offered on the set menu was not worth the price I paid. My total bill came up to about $100. 

Would I recommend this place? Yes, I'd recommend coming to this place but it would probably be better to order from the regular menu. I would come back to try that out- especially their oysters!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of great things about the Chase and decided to come here for Winterlicious dinner. It's quite the nice upscale restaurant with that trendy feeling inside. Our reservation was for 7:30 but it took 20 minutes to setup our table which was a bit irritating. It took about 40 minutes to have our food orders placed. It was a shame that everything was pushed back because the food was great and it is as good as people say it is. It's too bad the customer service level was subpar. I ordered the Salmon tartare and it was quite delicious and seasoned well. For the main course, I ordered the Braised Beef Short Rib. It was nice, juicy and tender. Definitely love this dish and how it was cooked. For dessert, I got the Caramelized Banana ice cream sundae. There wasn't anything special about it but I love ice cream so I'm bias. For some strange reason, the waiter forgot my dessert and didn't noticed for a good 5 minutes and I had to flag him down. Overall, its a great restaurant with delicious food. I just wished the service was a lot better."}
{"text":"Came here for a second time with colleagues. I love the casual elegance of the second floor. It's so beautifully decorated! The food that we had was far better than what we for Winterlicious (the food was definitely prepared hastily back when we first visited). Everything that we had was done really well with the exception of the lobster legs - they just weren't fresh. I especially enjoyed the Hen of the Woods side dish and the linguini and clams. I also recommend getting the Purple Haze drink as well. For dessert, I really enjoyed the chocolate dessert - the milk chocolate ganache was spectacular. I'm glad that I've visited The Chase for a second time and got to experience what they truly have to offer."}
{"text":"My previous review about the food and beverages still stands. My misgiving about a fifth star, based on my recent visit is kind of idiosyncratic. I loved my sesame encrusted salmon. The sommelier turned me on to a great Canadian Riesling. The upstairs dining room is elegant and infused with the evening sun. The alleyway entrance is neat. What seems off about the place is that the female servers are outfitted in grey corporate style dresses. They look like hostess uniforms at a convention or receptionists at a law firm. Hostesses here are dressed in black dresses. Maybe it's really a compliment to how well managed or detail oriented the restaurant is, but it feels too corporate. I think I prefer the more casual dining on the ground floor. Having said that, I still love the place."}
{"text":"Service was excellent but the quality of the seafood was a little disappointing since the menu seemed promising for seafood lovers. 

We ordered the yonge platter thinking it has a good assortment - oysters, tuna, clams and shrimp. The clams were unpleasantly fishy, the rest tasted fine but just wasn't as fresh as I had hoped. 

Out of all the other items we ordered which included the lobster pie, hot smoked white fish, octopus and scallops, we enjoyed the  hot smoked white fish the most. It was tangy and on a crunchy and warm toasted bun. The sunchokes which was recommended as one of the favorites was also quite tasty with a generous amount of cheese. 

However 3 stars overall based on my experience with the raw seafood since it was what we came here for!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is THE spot with great service, setting and food if you want to impress that special person. The power brokers on Bay Street seem to be in full attendance here. Dare I say I would choose this space over mainstay Bymark for that \"wine and dine\" meal. 

Very elegant and upscale. Mostly suits and dresses so come prepared. The entrance is down the side alley and then up an elevator from the seafood restaurant on the main floor. Tremendously seemless and on-point service with food the matches up which is rare. 

An excellent lobster truffle appetizer. The octopus app was uniquely tender and delicious. Mains included a perfectly done halibut slightly heavy on the salted crust. Scallops cooked right with a light sear and translucent through center. 

The price point is high but right now you might not find a more luxuriant dining experience in Toronto."}
{"text":"Very swanky spot. Went a little underdressed but, hey the customer is always right! You can tell that their staff and the general quality of this place is top notch. I don't think you can be disappointed with anything on their menu. 

I recommend the halibut. 
Thank me later."}
{"text":"The best patio in the downtown cord. Over looking Cloud Gardens, 5 stories up, there is no where even close. The food is good and light. Like all downtown places, it's a little pricey."}
{"text":"Amazing service, outstanding food!! We came here for Valentine's Day! We thought this would be crazy and horrible service! Honestly it was OUTSTANDING! When we walked in they didn't get the note my bf was 6'6 giant and we were afraid to get a shitty table, it didn't even phase them, helped us right away!  Tarek the server was amazing, made great suggestions and was super patient and you can tell he loved his job. The fooooood! Omg the food! Amazing the oysters, do east coast sex on the bay from PEI, they rocked. At the end we called The manager Harry over to tell him how great this was. If this is how a busy night like Valentine's Day was we can only imagine how good it would be on a regular night. Thank you so much the chase seafood!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. A bit casual downstairs, and more upscale upstairs. The food has been good every time, and the service is solid, but hardly stand-out. One waiter on the second floor is a bit chilly, but I found that he's warmed up after seeing me a few times. 

The rooftop patio is a good factor, but if you go in the summer time for an afternoon drink, bring your sunglasses and sunscreen! There is very little shade up there.

I'm an oyster junkie and have not been disappointed with the quality. The only downside I've experienced is that the variety of oysters is very limited on the second floor. They normally tell me they only offer 2 types while the downstairs oyster bar has a great variety. I wish they could send some upstairs.

All in all a great post-work watering hole and a good place for an upscale oyster experience (much more so than places like Oyster Boy or Rodney's)."}
{"text":"Nice place for seafood lovers. But make sure that you didn't want to go to \"the chase\" it's a different restaurant on 5th floor with same management. This one \"chase fish & oyster\" is more laid back. 
Food was good and staff were nice. It was definitely nice place to go on date if you like seafood. Very pricy though."}
{"text":"This review's a bit late. I tried this place out back in October when the weather was a lot more patio-esque. The drinks are a bit more pricey than I would have liked them to be, but in my opinion, the additional spending totally worth it because of the magnificent view from the patio. It's super classy and elegant - awesome for a date or anything of that sort.

Would recommend (in the summer, at least)!"}
{"text":"Very nice and cosy place. Unbelievable food. We order the seafood platter. Everything was perfect. Oysters were excellent. Lobster was very tender , amazing tuna. Everything was just melting in your mouth. The fish tacos were amazing. Customer service was perfect. Very polite and pleasant."}
{"text":"4/5

I came here for Summerlicious. 

Location: no great parking nearby. I parked at the Green P on Queen, near the Eaton Centre. Because I had reservations at 5:15, I had to pay both the before 6 and after 6 price... which came out to be $15. Quite pricey. Valet parking is $20. Other than the parking situation, the location is great... you can people-watch on Temperance, grab a drink at another fancy bar, or go shopping afterwards. 

Food: Summerlicious options were okay. I found it strange that they had chicken and waffles as a main since it's a fish and oyster restaurant, but hey, something for everybody."}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous review because I came here for Monday Night Unlimited Oysters for $30, aka the best $30 I've ever spent. 

For $30 you literally do get all the oysters you can eat (must order in multiples of 12), and they are meaty delicious malpeque and kusshi oysters. It's not like other buck-a-shuck places where the oysters you get are tiny vestiges of molluscs meant for a tiny sea animal to eat. You get various toppings including lemon, salsa, mignonette, and hot sauce. You can also request bread which comes from upstairs (the more expensive Chase) and is warm, buttery, slightly sweet, and FREE! I also recommend the fries as an accompaniment to the oysters. They also have half price bottles of champagne/sparkling wine ($30) on Monday nights. 

I suppose the value of the deal depends on how big of a glutton you are. I went with a group of 4 other gluttons and we EACH ate 48 oysters. No exaggeration. In fact they ran out of the malpeque and kusshi oysters and had to give us chef's creek oysters towards the end (also delicious). We started to feel somewhat euphoric by the end of it - Google tells me that shellfish in large amounts can be toxic, or maybe it was the aphrodisiac overload... in any case the final bill of $37 for that many amazing oysters was completely worth it and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I want to return for a romantic date. 

This place is so cute and elegant. Service is warm and hospitable. 

They have a very interesting menu with plenty of delicious things to choose from po' boys and the arctic char were so perfect! 

YUMMEH!"}
{"text":"Dined at The Chase during Winterlicious and the food was OK. Nothing special. However, I did like The Bay Platter (oysters, clams, tuna, crab, shrimp, ceviche & lobster - $110) from their a la carte menu, which was why I decided to give The Chase another chance. 

Came back two weeks later for Valentine's day, and my partner and I both left very disappointed. We ordered the Diamond Platter (oysters east & west king crab legs, shrimp, tuna & poached lobster - $150) and one Valentine's Day dinner.  I know the Bay platter and Diamond Platter have different descriptions, but they are quite similar, and for an additional $40 charge we expected the portions to be a bit bigger. But the portions were 30% less then the Bay Platter. I have pictures to prove! For the one Valentine's day dinner we had ordered, the 3 coursed meal arrived out of order and our server almost forgot my main until I reminded him. From hearing other couples around us, everyone had the same problem and were really irritated. Everything was evidently disorganized. Being a server myself, I understand that it's very busy because it's Valentine's Day, and mistakes do happen. 

But what made my experience at the Chase even worst was learning that we OVERCHARGED for our meal. We were charged for TWO Valentines Day dinners when my partner and I had only ordered ONE (since the other person had ordered the Diamond platter). I had recently learned this from reading a review on OpenTable of a customer paying $125 for two dinners. Altogether our bill came up to over $300, most of which was for food and services we had not even received."}
{"text":"So we heard from a friend of ours to go on a Monday and take advantage of their awesome deal....$29 AYCE fresh oysters, all shucked and cleaned, can't go wrong with that ever...and did I mention about the half price bubbles with this...a deal that no one should be missing....

My girlfriends and I fully took advantage of this deal on Monday evening after work. We arrived around 6ish and the place wasn't packed yet, we were seated quickly and ordered some appetizers to start, we shared a lobster roll ($12) but it was small, so I personally think it wasn't worth it, cod tacos were A-OK, a tad bit overcooked with the cod, oyster po boy was huge ($6 a piece, well worth it, small bun tho), clam chowder was full of ingredients a tad bit too much sodium..

Sometimes, they have different kinds of oysters but we had french kisses that night, we ordered i think around 8 dozens amongst only 3 girls, even the manager was like \"you girls are definitely getting your money worth\" LOL..

half price bottled prosecco, we ordered like 3 or 4 bottles of the italian one...and believe this or not....we were well stuffed with oysters and drank like fishes and the cost of each person was only $120 ($97 pretax) sooo worth it...

I would come back every Monday if tuesday wasn't a normal business working day..."}
{"text":"Not to be confused with the Chase (upstairs), the Chase Fish and Oyster has a relaxed, causal but classy atmosphere. Tuna nachos are a standout, knockout win. The menu has great variety without being overwhelming. Most importantly, the staff is attentive, knowledgable and super friendly. A definite win if you love seafood."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great selections of food. We basically ordered everything on the menu. The veal was so tasty, the beef tartare was so fresh with an egg on top and I had the Arctic char which was yummy! I have to say, their house bread is the best of all! No butter needed for it was infused with it and oh my Lord, I am not counting my calories or carbs."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Desserts could use some work but an amazing experience for our xmas party of 12!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came in here for dinner this evening.  The hostesses were really lovely, and there was a live band (but not a band because it was a guy on a guitar and singing on the patio), generally kind of inviting for likely one of the last nice evenings we will have in Sept.

Our server was rather abrupt in her communication, which was neither this way nor that at the beginning of the evening.  However as our evening progressed, our experience continued downhill.  It took them about 15 minutes to bring a glass of wine which was ordered before our food.  I had probably inquired about it 3 times, and on the last inquiry, the server told us there was a technical glitch.  Yes, that happened.

We ordered an app and fish and chips to share, which they brought out of the same time.  We had the fish and chips first because no one likes cold fish and chips quite frankly.  The app was tuna nachos (which was effectively 8 or so thinly sliced pieces of taro \"chips\" topped with marinaded tuna and string of veggie garnish for about $17), which although tasty was rather not enjoyable, because the chips had become quite soggy.

Overall, it wasn't super impressive, from an experience perspective, but really delicious.  I managed to flag down the manager just to let him know about our experience...because truly for $100 for a really light dinner of 1 entree, 1 app and 2 glasses of wine, the service should be amazing.  I wasn't mad or upset, but it could have been a lot better.  The manager was pretty understanding and he took care of us in the end, and our server even managed a meek almost apology.

I would try them out again because I feel like there's potential to have a really great experience.  And the fish in the fish and chips was really good."}
{"text":"Party of 6- private dining 
 
On temperance st; best way is to go south of Gerrard and turn left on to Temperance any other way is going to get you making round about all over the place. Don't bother looking for public parking-2-3 blocks away not good for heels, much much easier to so valet for $20. 

The entry is in some alleyway and when you get in you gotta go to the 5th floor for private dining. Decor is okay- they obviously were in a rush because the north wall is a complete travesty in a designers point of view but that's besides the point lol 

Truffle fries ordered for the table a m a z a n g! Bread is fluffy and soft and crispy crust. 

For the appetizer I ordered the duck confit flatbread- no cheese so it was greatness. As for dinner everyone ordered halibut which is a shared dish for 2, my man and I ordered the sea bream dish and scallop dish. I mean presentation is nice but I think the scallops weren't cooked properly- why? Because I was throwing up all over the place but that could be my fault too lol 

I didn't give them 3 stars because I tried the halibut and it was pretty delicious but if you go don't get the scallops blah"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. Probably one of the best run and most consistent restaurants in toronto.  It very much caters to the Bay Street business crowd, and is $$$$, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delectable - food wise and ambience wise. We made reservations for 5 and although we ran a little late we still got a beautiful seating next to the window and a view of the entire place; which featured dim lighting, a bar and light music which gave the cosiest and most brilliant atmosphere. Food wise, we were served with the perfect amount of time between courses and we were lucky to have the sweetest server who kept checking in on us and engaging in conversation. She seemed genuinely happy to serve us and that's what completely amplified the experience, the servers there were all extremely friendly and caring. The food itself was delicious, the main course being the best. I had a lobster roll and my boyfriend had fish and chips, which was perfectly crisp on the outside with such a soft inside that melted in your mouth with such decadence. My lobster roll on the other hand had the perfect amount of lobster within a bun that was amazingly perfect. It was chewy all the while being buttery and soft, and with the herb aioli side it was simply put: perfect. A great place, I'll definitely visit again in the summer months for the outdoor patio which was currently closed for the winter months !"}
{"text":"Been a while but Chase definitely delivers. Stellar service where they went out of their way to make a custom cocktail to their gorgeous fresh oyster platter. The casual, chic and bright decor - love everything about this place. Best for: dates, friends, family lunch / dinner"}
{"text":"Like what others have said, once you step in (entrance on the side in a mini alley), you're greeted by an upscale but welcoming environment.

I came for lunch with a friend for winterlicious and was sat next to the glass doors. It was a nice sunny day, so it made the ambiance (and all the foodie pics) really nice.

Our server was great, nothing negative that I can remember. We were in a bit of a rush to wrap up the lunch and it was difficult to find our server unfortunately.

Most notable were the app and dessert:

Bay Shrimp Louie - creamy shrimp salad yum, their seafood is fresh and on point. 
Root Beer Float - super cool, you get pour the root beer onto the ice cream here. It would of been even cooler if it was coffee though haha.

Overall, nice swanky restaurant for seafood - however nothing really stands out too much that I would come back again with so many other restaurants around."}
{"text":"I was incredibly impressed. 

The food was incredible. I got the Avocado appetizer which is healthier version of a California roll: an avacado roll with shrimp on the inside and little pieces of grapefruit on top.

For my main I got the Halibut and I was blown away. The fish was perfect and well complimented by the capers, the browned tartar sauce, and all the veggies. 

Everyone was satisfied with their meals and I would definitely go again. Service was slow though so budget time."}
{"text":"Service service service!!!!

Don't get me wrong, they have an articulate and very attractive staff who KNOW their ingredients and menu items. But it is flat out chaos. 

Despite the sneers from hostesses when I showed up for a reservation for one (not the lovely dark skinned British accent one. She was great), I was sat promptly.

I sat unapproached by wait staff for 10 minutes even after I had given all the obvious cues (napkin in lap and menus to the side face down) that I was ready to order. I was then given water and left alone for another 15 minutes. 

At this point I look rather pathetic and had a lovely table of 6 females next to me celebrating a birthday. They invited me over to join them (slid my table over.). Mind you they are post appetizer and I haven't even ordered mine. 

An alternate waitress (one I had not interacted with at all and was not serving the table of ladies) took my wine order, which was delivered promptly. 

I then had to wait another 20 minutes for the waiter to collect the entree orders of the ladies so that I could order my appetizer. Which the waiter got wrong and I had to wait yet again for another appetizer.

Granted, I was alone and staff could assume that I was waiting for someone. But I clearly made a reservation for one. The hostess never removed a second place setting. So if this is the cause.... Then those hostesses gave me a wonderful night because I had a blast going out with those ladies after dinner.

Food was good. Avocado app had gorgeous presentation and was flavorful. I was about a bottle in by this point so the delicate notes of the blossoms and the acidity of what I can assume was a light ceviche we muffled.

Wine list was insanely overpriced. $100 for a $14 bottle of 2013 Malbec Andeluna...... absurd. 

The lamb was excellent. Absolutely no hints of being gamey what so ever. Some meatballs hid under the chops and were unexpected but very average. 

All in all, the chase is more appealing visually than sound, taste, and smell. Presentation, decor, staff, and the beautiful Toronto elite are quite a sight. The place is over priced and over hyped but this was my first go at fine dining in Toronto so I don't know the standard."}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious. Really liked the restaurant upstairs so had high hopes. However, maybe it was because it was winterlicious, but the food wasn't that special. Meals were lukewarm, not hot when they came to the table. The lobster bisque didn't have that much meat in it. The main meal was pretty small portion. I did enjoy the donut dessert though."}
{"text":"3 * for the food, 5* for the patio-roof-top bar vibe.  I thought the food was good but not great.  Very good oysters, the big-eye tuna tartar didn't go well with the avocado stuff; my char was good but not outstanding.   However, loved the roof-deck drinks and patio vibe! Definitely awesome place to grab a drink and some food. Also, love the bread."}
{"text":"The rooftop restaurant is beautiful, and the service is great. The food is pretty good but way overpriced, as nearly $45 for a lunch appetizer is ridiculous. The wait also seems excessive, and I was concerned at times that they may have just forgotten my order. Best for long client lunches when no parties are in any rush."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious lunch at 1pm with 5 other friends and was a good experience.  Restaurant was about 85% full.  Service was good and food came out fast.
For appetizer we got all got the crispy oyster.  It was my favorite course for lunch.  The oyster was an adequate size and had a strong oyster taste.  The batter was very crispy and wasn't too thick.  The sesame tartar and spicy cabbage cocktail sauce complimented the dish very well.  
For main course I picked the Grilled Albacore Tacos.  Dish looked underwhelming and tasted average.  I'd recommend eating the jalapeno at the end because it overpowered rest of the flavours in the taco.  Wasn't a fan of the re-fried beans side.  Was able to sample my friend's Sweet Corn Orecchiette and potato salad.  Both were much better than my dish.
For dessert I got blueberry crumble.  The blueberry tasted like jam you can get a grocery and the crumble was too soggy and wasn't crunchy.
My expectations where high before the meal and the appetizer started the meal well then it just went downhill after that.  If I can give this a 3.5 I would but its definitely not a 4."}
{"text":"Not sure how to exactly write this review because I was super pumped to try this place out with all the hype..

The underlying theme was that it was soooo slow. I mean, I get that it was opening night and all but still..

We arrived on the patio and sat for a long time before someone came to our table.  The server had walked by quite a few times and smiled and eye-contacted but we never realized she was even our server until she finally showed up right at our table easily 20 minutes after our arrival.  So we asked for the 'carte à vin' (because she's French) and it came but I then asked to see the sommelier for a recommendation.  I saw him making his way through the tables on his way towards ours so figured he'd be right over, but he then went downstairs and so when I asked our server to ask him to come over so we could order wine she said she would try and find him.. And so another 20-30 minutes go by and still no sign (he did come by at the end of our meal and apologize for not coming over earlier because he was handling a large party downstairs and we had a nice chat and did a little wine tasting then), but after almost an hour of sitting with nothing to drink we finally just ordered a random Sauvignon Blanc bottle and hoped for the best.  Well, not entirely random, I do know my wine pretty alright, but still...

We actually came for the oysters but there was only one oyster dish on the upstairs patio menu so we asked if we could order oysters and stuff from the downstairs menu and she said we could...   I'm not sure if that was supposed to happen but it did.. I didn't get oysters though.. but the Oyster PoBoy sliders looked good..

Fried Chicken was overcooked and more than crispy to the point of crunchy..
Gnocchi side had 4 gnocchis (?) and was good but totally not anything special.

Couple more notes:
- Grilled scallops tasted a little charred
- Lamb chops were great though.
- The coleslaw side was nice as it almost tasted like a light caesar salad.

Got the bill and put my card in immediately but took about 20m more and a couple of walkbys.. sheesh.. let's GTFO.

Arrived just before 8pm and finally got out after 10:30!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and enjoyed the over all experience.  I usually use the AMEX platinum concierge to book reservations, which at certain resterautns gets you a free drink or something.  but always was able to get a table.

The patio upstairs is gorgeous.  The staff is friendly and the share plates were good.  The drinks I personally think is overpriced (and i do spend on quality drinks).  The food service was a bit slow i found upstairs.  I think at one point they forgot to enter our order in.  

Also visited for AYE monday's for oysters.  Now this is a deal to be had!  With half price bottles of bubbles...perfect combo.  They have a East coast and West coast option.

The hot sauce they use is great as well!

Service started fast with the oysters, but it got slower as time goes on.  We did order though more than enough though :)  We also did Muscles which was cooked perfect.

Value for the Monday's is five star.  Go earlier and order faster as by 630-7 your waiting for ever.

I will defn go back."}
{"text":"Delicious and trendy.  
Went here with a friend and had no problems getting seated even though the place was very busy. Everything on the menu looked tempting and the food was delicious!! A great spot to hang with friends but maybe not a date as it is a little loud"}
{"text":"Overall: 4.5 (Food 4 stars; Service 5+)

I was living in Toronto when they opened but never got a chance to go. Was back early for the Labour Day long weekend so I made a reservation here to celebrate a champagne birthday. Overall I really could not have been more pleased with the entire dining experience.

In the reservation I had mentioned the occasion and that I was hoping to make it a special night. That was about all I needed to do, The Chase staff took care of the rest.

--LONG-WINDED COMMENTARY!--
We found ourselves seated at a prime corner location, lots of room for 2 people to get cozy and just a little tucked away from everyone else. Intimate without being too secluded (i.e. perfect)

Our server then proceeded to come out with 2 flutes of sparkling wine for our birthday girl and myself. No prompting required on my part.

As for the meal itself, to start we had the oyster po'boys, octopus, a selection of a dozen oysters (FYI, the red wine sauce with a splash of the hot sauce is the only sauce you'll need!), and the fish nachos. All were fantastic, with very well balanced flavours and perfect execution, albeit smaller portions than you might expect - upside, you get more variety.

Amongst the excellence described above, 2 dishes stood out in particular.
1. The chunks of chorizo + harissa that came with the octopus was a great pairing.
2. The tuna nachos were fantastic. Bite sized tuna sashimi on a taro root chip with a \"mustard emulsion\" (read: mustard mayo but props for elevating the foodie-jargon). What really elevated this dish was the unexpected mixing of Grand Padano into the  julienne vegetable slaw that garnishes this dish. Did not expect it; would not have thought it'd have worked if I heard it; but wow does it really pair well! Just that little kick of savoury really balanced the dish.

As for our mains, we had the steamed mussels and crispy pickerel.

The steamed mussels was another standout dish... or steamed MUTANT mussels should I say. I have never seen mussels that large and delicious! They almost looked like tulip bulbs they were so big. The sauce that the mussels came with definitely had a liberal portioning of butter yet it was not overpowering. Simply delicious. It also comes with a side of grilled sourdough bread topped with apricot butter. Forget the mussels, just the butter sauce and fresh bread alone would've made for a great snack.

The crispy pickerel was both a disappointment and a pleasant surprise. The namesake ingredient was deep fried and well seasoned, but ultimately I felt they could've done more with it. Don't get me wrong, it was well executed but when put in context of the amazing flavour profiles of all the other dishes we had, I just felt they could've done more to elevate the flavour of the batter. The first of 2 surprises were the puree of corn, which when paired with the pickerel added a great creamy texture and added a nice corny taste (hehe see what I did there! ... sorry, that was awful, I know). What REALLY was outstanding was the grilled pork belly that came with the dish. WOWZERS. Grilled just perfectly to give it that fantastic hint of smoke with just the right amount of fat. These hogs definitely did not die in vain! They really should rename the dish to \"Grilled Pork Belly\" and list the pickerel as a garnish. I've eaten a lot of pork belly and this is definitely up there with the best.

Dessert was a chocolate cream pie. Unsurprisingly it was also well executed - the birthday candle they added was a nice touch.

As for the service, it was totally top-notch. Kudos to the entire waitstaff. There were several birthday well-wishes for my gf, including a manager at the end of the evening dropping by to add a nice personal touch. I think the only time I've had better service in Toronto was at George.

--CAVEATS!--
The one aspect that may not be for everyone is their music selection. For me, my musical tastes resemble a Jackson Pollock (i.e. all over the place) so I found it pretty entertaining to start the night with Bryan Adams, move our way over to M83, and finish with some club anthems. The 2 old businessmen across the room from us... maybe not so much.

NB. The fish & oyster restaurant is the more casual sister to the sleek and sexy venue upstairs, but I would still dress a bit more upscale. At the very least, business casual or something you'd feel comfortable wearing to a lounge on King St. The Pickle Barrel this is not.

--CONCLUSION!--
End-to-end it was the perfect dinner date and I would highly recommend the Chase Fish & Oyster."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and enjoyed the lovely ambiance. Very romantic with candle light and live music (Thursdays and Fridays). The food however was okay. I ordered their Nova Scotia cod ($34) and found that there are bones in my fish which I found interesting. They also provided potatoes and cooked greens (they looked and tasted like romaine lettuce). In my perspective not worth the price. My partner ordered the whole lobster ($40) which they removed the shell for you. That was a nice touch. He said the fries were a bit salty and the melted butter could have used a bit more flavor but overall he found it okay. The drinks were delicious and the dessert was too. Their key lime pie cake with a marshmallow top was moist and not to lemony. The cocktails were fun and not too overpowering with rye or whiskey. Overall,  the environment is what I would come back for and maybe to try their fried chicken because it looked divine at the table beside us!"}
{"text":"Hidden away on Temperance, off of Bay, The Chase was a fantastic find. Construction of yet another huge building project engulfs the area so you'd miss it if you didn't know what you were looking for. The restaurant is well designed, exposed brick, high ceilings, bright and with lots of character (blue glasses for water). Service was outstanding with highly knowledgeable and friendly staff - our waitress was great. Our group had the following:
- Oyster po'boy sliders (garlic scape tartar sauce) - cooked perfectly, delicately fried and meaty with a nice finish from the tartar
- Baked Clams - braised lamb neck, tamato jam, brioche crumble)
- Pan Roasted Scallop (toasted brioche, roasted fois gras, smoked duck, apple, lemon relish) - I didn't eat these but I was told it was amazing 
-  Swordfish - madras, chilli mint chutney, eggplant - excellent, nice spice and very tender fish. Not a fan of eggplant but it was cooked very well
- Lamb Chops - yogurt marinated and grilled, mint apple sauce and kale - didn't have this but was told it was good 
- Lobster \"Waldorf\" roll - candied walnuts, apple, yogurt, milk bun, dill Yukon chips - I didn't eat this but there were mixed reviews although the chips were excellent
- Apple Crumble - Excellent
- Lime coconut desert - Excellent

Everything was terrific and I loved the service. Will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed.  The service was pretty bad but not disqualifying.  We were seated downstairs and maybe that's part of the problem.  However the food was very disappointing.  My fried chicken was just bad (crumbly batter, dry and tough chicken) and the slaw and biscuit it came with were far too salty.  I barely ate any of it.  The dessert was cloyingly over the top sweet.   This is the kind of food I expect at a chain family restaurant."}
{"text":"I finally got around to visiting Chase this weekend, and it was a pretty big disappointment.  I know that the restaurant industry has been in steep decline lately with most kitchens just thawing and assembling food in pretty ways, but Chase did not even pull that off very well.

We had octopus or rubber.  I couldn't tell for sure since the texture was identical.  The taste was bland, although using harissa was creative.  The cod tacos were badly overcooked.  Twice.  And once again freezer burnt, bland and lamely assembled.  The tuna \"nachos\" (which was tuna and slaw on fried taro root) was actually pretty good relative to the other dishes, but it was way over-sugared and the tuna was poor quality (think tuna remnants).  Oyster selection was poor and mignonette sucked - which is pretty hard to pull off.

Our server was a delight.  The loud women and children at tables near us were not.  I think this place amplifies sound because I literally was yelling to make myself heard even though tables are not situated so close together.  I didn't hear many male voices so maybe they know something I don't...

We left Chase and walked over to Ki to not make the night a total gastronomic disappointment.  Do yourself a favour and visit a different establishment."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have noticed The Chase if it hadn't been introduced to me. Right at the heart of DT, it sits quietly on a side street and the entrance is down a short alleyway (which makes it initially a little bewildering to navigate). However, upon walking in, all you smell is the salt and sea so you know it's a good seafood place. The first floor is more relaxed with a darker cozy decor, while the second floor is bright and fancy. All things equal, I would recommend the second floor since it's a nicer space and has a interesting view of the city.

Can't speak to the food and I was there for after drinks, but it was the perfect place to enjoy a cocktail and share about work woes. There are plenty of suits that are doing the same. Service was prompt and understood we didn't want to be bothered, but came around when drinks got low. Will definitely be back for a meal in the future!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday.  We arrived early for our dinner reservation and decided to enjoy drinks at the patio.  Great service from start to finish. Servers were attentive but not intrusive.  We were able to enjoy our romantic dinner together.  They had a birthday card waiting for me at the table. The complimentary bread they serve which is baked in house daily was superb. I could have finished the whole loaf by myself and not share,  and I realized the bf is paying  
We had the prosciutto flatbread to start.  It's a good balance if flavours and texture.  For mains,  I ordered the lobster pasta.  Very small serving for $50,  but it's worth the price.  Lots of lobster meat and the sauce was so flavourful.  My boyfriend ordered tenderloin,  which was melt in the mouth goodness. The birthday cake was the only thing not stellar as it was too sweet for my liking,  but the smooth cuppa Joe made up for it.  This would definitely be on my list special occasions restaurants.  I'm still salivating over the bread."}
{"text":"Worst high end restaurant ever! I've never been so sick . Go to chiado if u want good seafood. Waste of money. Very disappointed . I would rather eat a quesadilla."}
{"text":"Holy attitude. They rushed us in and out. Food was just okay.  Manager was patronizing. Not nice."}
{"text":"We ate in the downstairs part of this restaurant.

I have to say -- we were treated just great.
We did not have a reservation, and so ended up a table by the bar.
Do not hesitate to do this folks.  We got great services.

The bartender JJ was quick to look after getting us a beverage and took the time to have  a short chat with us too!

We had the Tuna nachos to start (yum!!). I had the fried chicken (which is OMG yummy with a warm biscuit) and my hubby had the salmon.   The service and food were fantastic all around.

We noticed quite a few regulars stop by.  
We will definitely go back.
Food quality and service were great.
Do not hesitate to check it out!"}
{"text":"Went here in January and first thing is first, the service was exceptional.   Sommelier was a nice touch as the wine selection is quite good.  We had the Lamb and the Veal, both of which were delicious.  The gnocchi was light and the Chard and Rapini were both great.  We had the side of Brussel sprouts on a reco and they came through big time.  Great place but request a window table."}
{"text":"If you want to impress a date/friend/visitor, take them to the Chase; especially in the summer. 
Their food is absolutely delicious, their fish is so fresh, and the view at the patio/outdoor seating is beautiful. 

Prices are a little high so it's somewhere I like to go to treat myself. 

Only bad thing I have to say is one of the five times I came here, our waitress was rude to the girls on our table (and only the girls). I don't know if she was having a bad day or if that's how she always is, but it was the only unpleasant thing I've ever experienced here."}
{"text":"Food poisoning is never a pleasant experience and unfortunately, despite how much I love The Chase (its environment, hospitality, etc.), the quality of the food just isn't up to par with its environment and looks. And recently, I had a horrible, excruciatingly painful food poisoning experience following my visit here.

First, you should know that The Chase is one of THE spots for people who work in the Financial District - lawyers, partners, investment bankers, it's a popular spot for this type of crowd. If you can't find them at the Cactus Club, Ki, or Earl's, there's a good chance they're here. It's very common to have business lunches, dinners, and meetings here, and there's a reason why - ambiance is beautiful. Upstairs, you'll find lush velvety couches, bright, modern and sophisticated décor, and the upscale feel only a truly luxurious restaurant can bring.

On a recent visit, I came for a work lunch and ordered their Salmon ($34.00). The waitress informed me that they don't cook their Salmon well-done. They slow-cook it until it's semi-cooked in order to preserve its soft, tender texture. I said, sure, why not, I didn't mind. I ate the Salmon, and it was just alright - it wasn't very flavourful, and it was coated in what looked like a tub of butter.

A few hours later, I began to feel the most excruciating pain in my stomach (besides my lunch at The Chase that day, I had eaten my daily/usual muffin and coffee for breakfast - so there's little chance the pain could have come from elsewhere besides The Chase). The pain began to get worse during the day and into the evening (I could barely swallow my dinner, and it wouldn't stay down) - and what followed were two really, really painful days in bed/in the bathroom (TMI, sorry). It felt like I had swallowed a knife, and it was having a party in my stomach.

My (and my colleague's) best guess is that The Chase's \"Slow-Cooked\" salmon wasn't cooked well enough to kill whatever bacteria could have been in the fish. But, you would think, for the price point, they'd clean the salmon enough to ensure something like this doesn't happen.

So despite its close proximity to my office and how much I really enjoy the ambiance (and the fries - covered in truffle & herb aioli, delicious), I don't think I'll be back at The Chase."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check out The Chase for a while, and Winterlicious was offering a pretty decent-looking menu, so that settled that.

We decided to veer away from the Winterlicious menu and order six oysters to start with. I'm no oyster expert, but these were very tasty, meaty, and shucked extremely well. A promising beginning.

I decided to start with the Salmon Tartar (Horseradish Crème Fraiche, Beet Relish, Crispy Capers). This was definitely a decent appetizer, though perhaps not as flavorful as I might've hoped. More seasoning might have helped, probably. But the chunks of fish were delicious and plentiful.

(A brief digression: I think it's extremely odd that a seafood place would have only one seafood option for the main course. Who goes to a place like this and orders vegetable lasagna or beef short rib? Psychotics, that's who.)

So I got the Pan Seared Arctic Char (Potato Rosti, Braised Red Cabbage, Caramelized Apple, Chestnut) as my main course. I'll start by saying that the fish was cooked perfectly and that the potato rosti was surprisingly delicious. But, like the appetizer, this essentially came off as a decent dish that simply wasn't elevated at all. It feels like something I could've made at home with a little effort, and if this is indicative of the kind of dishes on offer at The Chase, I'm surprised the restaurant was as crowded as it was.

The dessert, Caramelized Banana Sundae (Vanilla Ice Cream and Warm Date Toffee), was an extremely underwhelming note to end on. The banana, what little there was, was hardly caramelized at all, and the overwhelming taste was vanilla ice cream.

If I had paid 20 bucks for my meal, I probably wouldn't be this disappointed. I doubt I'd ever go back."}
{"text":"U must try the homemade truffle bread!!! Best place for afterwork drink on the rooftop patio"}
{"text":"We booked seating for three at the Chase just prior to New Years. The entrance on initial observation would appear to be the front but it is actually on the side when you walk down an alleyway and see the \"Chase\" sign.

 A wooden cottage style door is what you see along with some kitchen staff working with oysters and lobster. The bottom floor is a bit noisier and seems to be for special events with lobster and oysters or to have wine. I may try downstairs next time.

The upstairs is more of a fine dining experience complete with white couches and wood tables. Food is a bit on the higher side with appetizers going for 16 dollars, main course around the 30 dollar range and desert for 11 dollars. 

The food is very good. I had a smoked tuna with some avocado and my parents had the arctic char which was also quite good. Quite impressed with the broccoli side with garlic - had a Pan Asian feel to it. Really enjoyed the experience and would like to go back again if there is another opportunity."}
{"text":"Oh, how I love The Chase...

I came here for my birthday with several girlfriends and had a great time. Beautiful decor (we were upstairs), and the food was equally amazing.

Here's the story. I started with the Pearl Platter, which was fantastic. It was a wonderful start for my pre-planned 'surf and turf' birthday dinner. For my main, I obviously had one too many pre-dinner cocktails, because I accidentally ordered the Steak SPECIAL the server was raving about, not knowing that it was for TWO people. It was so grand that they came to show me the cut prior to cooking it. YES, it was beautiful. YES, it was huge. And it cost an arm and a leg. I think my final bill came to $300... for just me. I was a birthday balla that night. 

I did take half of it home so it was great the next day to feed my killer hangover."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service was great.  The bread, which is baked in-house is also exceptional.  We liked our appetizers as well, however we were very dissapointed with our main course.  We had a group of 5 people and at least two of the meals were border - line cold when they arrived.  Perhaps it was because they were busy but given the price of each entre your expectation is for everything to be perfect.
The portion of the meals are small so you do need appetizers and/or desert to walk-out the place without an empty stomach."}
{"text":"We went here and ate on the fifth floor level which is apparently a less fish centric experience.  Though they still have fish on the menu.  The steak was good though I personally have lost interest in large steaks like you find at Jacobs etc.  But if you like that you might like this.  Although I would say it wasnt seasoned enough.  

The halibut special was quite good.  The fries are awesome. . Truffle and Parmesan how can you go wrong!  I had the rhubarb and strawberry meringue... Very very tasty!  I also had the bacon flathead to start and it was excellent.  

So hit and miss... Some great and some not bad..."}
{"text":"Let me start off and say, that never for a valentine's special, i felt ripped off and still hungry after spending $150. I chose this place based off it's good reviews, good food but they really dropped the ball here and i don't think i can come back.

For $150 for 2 (not including tax or tip), this is what we got
- 2 oysters
- 2 appetizers that were probably no more than $15 each
- 1 food entree TO BE SHARED between two people. That entree was only enough 1 person, and my gf only eats for 1/2 a person
- 1 mediocre desert again TO BE SHARED between two people

And ya, they don't allow you to choose other options in the menu either. I guess it's true, Valentine's day is a money grabber and honestly, that should had really been it. And yes, apparently i was shocked all the other tables were looking at a food menu with not very impressive portions. the food was above average, but certainly not to justify the more than at least double price point"}
{"text":"Was suppose to be here for winterlicious but they had a private event which they didn't notify us in advance.  Good job.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I surprised my boyfriend for his birthday here last year, everyone loved it! The food is beyond delicious, we ordered two bay platters perfect for a group of 8. The halibut is a must try! Our server was very attentive, would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My fiancé has been wanting to go here for the longest time, but part of me has kinda given up on fine dining in Toronto. I'm tired of going out, spending a ton of money and leaving disappointed. Since it was her birthday yesterday I decided to give it a go and booked us a table for 2.

Upon arriving at the restaurant it looked really quiet in the main floor. Fortunately we weren't dining there as that is their other restaurant, which I'm sure is great, but is nowhere near as beautiful as their top floor main restaurant.

We rode the elevator up with a staff member who had been there since it had opened who mentioned that he loved working there since most of the staff stayed the same and we're all basically the same ones who opened the restaurant (a good sign). Upon exiting the elevator we were immediately greeted by a hostess who already knew who we were (probably notified from the downstairs one) and are coats were taken and we made our way through the stunning restaurant. 

The restaurant sits five floors up on Temperance street and has a Vegas style feel to it. By that I mean very elegant, high ceilings, big chandeliers and more. A room they clearly put some thought into knowing people are coming to spend a nice chunk of change to eat there. The tables had a bench which was basically a sofa on one side and an extremely comfortable chair on the other. I felt super comfortable there immediately and it has a classy yet cozy feel to the place.

Service was spot on throughout the entire meal, what you'd expect from fine dining. By this I mean napkins folded when you get up, cutlery changed at every course, never having to ask for a drink or water refill and very friendly with a smile. The staff all seemed to love being there which makes the experience even better.

We ordered the avocado shrimp dish and octopus to start along with the tuna and the Arctic char for mains. The apps range around $20 and the mains between $30-$60 (with minimal sides). We ordered a bottle of a Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand which was to die for ($87) to wash it all down. They brought an amuse bouche which was nothing special and some of the greatest bread I've ever tasted to start with a nice apple butter glaze on top.

The octopus was the best I've ever had, the avocado dish delicious but forgettable when compared to the octopus. The tuna was so tasty and the Arctic char had incredible flavour and texture contrasts. They were even kind enough to bring a chocolate desert for my fiance since I mentioned it was her birthday which was chocolate heaven. Overall this was the best meal I've ever had in Toronto.

Total came to $225 + tip so it's more of a special occasions place (unless you are balling out of control) but we will definitely be heading back hopefully sooner than later."}
{"text":"Wow! Service is amazing, food too. Can't get over the attention to detail. If there, try to get in Annie's section, she is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Summerlicious 2016

Lunch menu

Price: $23 + tx

Ordered:
App - Crispy Oyster (1 oyster)
Main - Albacore tacos (2 tacos)
Dessert - Ice Cream Sundae (in a jar)

App: a lot of batter, but the oyster inside was not small, so that helped a bit and the black mayo spicy sauce gave it a good kick. The batter, however, was too thick that it brought down the whole taste.

Main: the taco shell (soft) was pretty bad. It brought apart the moment I grab hold it it, also it tasted very odd and flour-y like it wasn't fully baked or cooked enough. The albacore chunks (2 per taco) was nice and thick and perfectly seared on the outside and raw on the inside (the way I like it). I ended up eating the taco with a fork and only ate what was inside and left the shell to its lonesome.

Dessert: Can't go wrong with dessert, and they didn't . My ice cream (jar )sundae was fun, tasty with lots of complimentary flavours (brownie, compote, cherry, chocolate shavings) and very satisfying.

I was really looking forward to eating at this restaurant (for years), however, the first two dishes left me high and dry. But, the dessert bumped up their rating by 1.5 to make it a total of 3 stars. 

Quite honestly, I think Summerlicious has gone down in the last 5-7 years. When I first moved here in early 2000, the portions were bigger, the taste were equal to their regular menu and the quality of it all was so much better."}
{"text":"I saw The Chase featured on on BlogTO a few weeks ago as it had just opened. The location was convenient and blocks from my office so it made my shortlist of places to try.

The girlfriend and I arrived on a Friday night (~8:30) without reservation. I had looked up reservations on the website earlier that day to find no availability anywhere near this time. Luckily though, they had a number of high-top tables available near the bar area that we didn't mind - so we were seated immediately. Our table was situated right center around the kitchen door, main entrance and elevator up to The Chase.

Drinks - 
The cocktails were quite pricey (~20+) - I'm used to seeing those prices in Singapore but not in Toronto! I opted for a beer, while she had a glass of the Sauvignon Blanc.

Food - 
We ordered the following, to share between us:
     App: Scallop Tostada (poblano and tomatillo salsa, avocado, lime, radish)

     Main 1: Steamed Mussels (garlic, white wine, lovage, shoestring fries)

     Main 2: Fried Chicken (smoked cheddar potato bun, hot sauce butter, savoy & provolone slaw)

Overall, all dishes were a hit! 

We LOVED the Scallop Tostada. They came out on a plate of 3 - lined up with a separate piece of lime for each. They were a nice size (about 2-4 bites). Upon first bite, you get a nice crispy crunch of the tostada on the bottom, while the scallop and citrusy salsa mix above hits your tongue together. I would highly recommend ordering this particular dish to start - it is fantastic.

The Steamed Mussels were fantastic too. They came out in this giant pot with a side plate of shoestring fries. I didn't care much for the fries - a little too thin for my liking. The mussels were great however. They are a PEI farmed breed of blue mussels and they were HUGE and meaty. The broth was delicious as well. I just wished it came with some bread as well so we could soak up all that flavour.

Fried Chicken: This was my choice for the night - while it was very delicious too, it got beat out by the Scallop Tostada and Steamed Mussels and took last place. The chicken was nice and crispy on the outside - juicy on the inside. It came with 2 large pieces of chicken, mostly boneless except for a thigh bone. The chicken went great with the hot sauce butter - a little spicy and tangy at the same time.

For dessert - we shared a blueberry pie with ice cream on the side. It wasn't on the menu and I am not a huge dessert guy so the memories are a bit lacking.


Our experience was great, we were checked up on frequently by our waiter as well as other staff in passing. One hiccup that occurred was that our mains came out 2 seconds after our appetizer arrived. We were told (by our waiter) that we ordered the exact same 3 dishes as a nearby table of two ladies. I suspect that the mains arriving at our table were actually destined for them. 
Our waitress picked up on this the second she saw all 3 dishes had arrived to our table - and I could see her and a few other of the dining staff talk about how to mitigate the situation. They must've put a rush order on their mains because it wasn't too long after that I saw the dishes come out for them.


Overall thumbs up! Everyone go check it out!"}
{"text":"I think 4 stars should have been the natural rating for this restaurant.  I believe service and ambience is good. The ambience is a good balance between homey and quiet elegance.  The idea of being able to enjoy good seafood in downtown Toronto alone, should have been a sure win.  Fisherman's Wharf fanned on that shot greatly and folded.  So let's face it, The Chase can win this without even breaking a sweat.  Where did they go wrong?

Simple, the food was just simply not that stunning.  They had options, but only just.  This restaurant may have been accidentally bowled over by its own internet presence, because the yelp reviews surely catapulted it to heights that it never could beat.  I found that the lack of choices in late June seemed a bit unusual considering how great my fellow yelpers were raving about this place.

Choice being an issue, the next was really the portions.  Did I say quiet elegance earlier with regards to the ambience?  That's because it had that hint of upscale posh.  It brought with it a swagger of confidence, that it will attract the young and ambitious.  I felt it, looking at the menu, the meal being served, and felt that I just wasn't one of those young and ambitious young people who are often stereotyped to require a high class gym membership, a high kale-based diet, complete with a strict adherence to eating very little.  All of that, topped with a very luxurious paycheck that allows them to go through with this meal without hardly blinking an eye.  Don't get me wrong, I don't think less of the stereotype I just listed, I just know I'm not really the type of person The Chase is trying to cater to.  

In all honesty though, the food tasted great (especially if you ordered the more flamboyant choices or the seafood bake). I just can't help but think, I could have a better spend of money elsewhere and feel more fulfilled in the end.  It felt like going for a fancy meal, but all I ended up getting was fancy, but not much of a meal.  

Will I come back?  I have my doubts.  I won't discourage people from going, but I think you really need to pre-eat before going.  Wait, doesn't that defy the purpose of going to a restaurant to eat in the first place?"}
{"text":"When you go out to eat with my cousin, you know you're in for good times. It'd been way too long since we last hang out so I let her choose the spot for a Friday work lunch (well, work for her at least). She loves classy spots so she ended up choosing The Chase - did I mention it has an unreal rooftop patio?

To get to said rooftop, you need to take the shortcut alleyway to the back of the restaurant and upon entering, you'll see an elevator to your left. Take that and you'll be whisked up to the top floor. Be prepared to eat with all the downtown workers, all dressed up in suits and dresses. Felt sorry for them because it was scorcher of a day and the sun was out full blast. Lucky, we had a table by the windows and were partially covered.

This place is fancyyyyy. Heck, they filmed an episode of Suits in the back area of the restaurant. Nice to see they have a lunch menu but prices easily fall into dinner territory.

Service was top notch as our waitress was on top of drinks and the works. I believe one of the cooks came out to bring out one of their dishes which was a nice touch.

- Lamb ($28.00) - shank tagine, pomegranate, grilled bitter greens and couscous. Oh man, the couscous and vegeteables (roasted cauliflower and carrots) were unbelievable. Pomegranate and lamb is a great combo although normally you see that with Persian food. Lamb was flavourful but I wish it was more gamey. You couldn't really tell that it was lamb which defeats the purpose of even ordering lamb then. Give me that lamb, gamey, juicyness.

- Albacore tuna ($29.00) - seared loin crusted in fresh herbs served with mixed grain salad, pickled vegetables, feta and olives. Look at the sear on the outside and nice rawness on the inside. Nice thickness, perfectly cooked with a super tasty sauce underneath.

- Frites ($8.00) - pecorino, truffle and herb aioli. S wanted fries to round out our meal and these were satisfying.

Cool, trendy spot if you like combining food with rooftops and patios. Bring the expense account card with you! Anyone know where I can get one of those?"}
{"text":"After hearing about the service issues upstairs I did not want to take the risk and instead took my clients to the fish and oyster part of the restaurant . Oysters were wonderful - not a big expert but it was out of this world. I got the market fish as the main and I struggled with this as there were very many bones although it was supposed to be largely de boned. Fries were delicious. I highly recommend the desserts - the key lime pie and apple tart is outstanding. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"Service excellent.  Friendly knowledgeable and professional.  

Food - very tasty and nicely plated.  Selection is a little limited and tends towards fish/seafood.  Had lobster app - nicely cooked, tender and decent portion for an app.  Devilled egg was not the greatest possibly heavy on paprika?

Beef main - was pretty good but nothing too memorable.  Sides of fries and mushrooms were both quite good.

Ambience - pretty loud but nice enough decor. Some areas are starting to look a little worn (happens when MDF gets wet too often).  Pricey but quality of ingredients and level of service make up for it."}
{"text":"I've been to The Chase a few times and I have a good time every time I come. The place is elegantly decorated with dim lighting, and the food is amazing in its taste and presentation. I still can't forget the lobster special I had here on Valentine's Day 2 years ago! Staff is attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about their oysters. The only downside is that sometimes it gets so busy (especially around dinnertime) that it's a bit hard to get staff attention, and I've had to wait 15 minutes before being seated despite making a reservation. Price range is on the higher side but it's worth the experience. Overall, The Chase is definitely the spot for me when I crave quality seafood and drinks in a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and full of tasty seafood dishes. The wine selection was also solid and the staff was extremely good. You pay for it but you get what you pay for which is a very good experience and meal.
If you think you'll like clever seafood dishes you'll like this place."}
{"text":"Organized a bachelor party here and the planning and service was awesome. We actually dinner at Chase Fish and Oyster for a group of about 10 guys. We pretty much shared the entire menu and everything came out tasty. Of course you gotta be into seafood at a place like this and the oysters are the way to go. Fancy drinks and apps are available to get you started. I would pass on he soups though and just get the main. Def would try this place again!"}
{"text":"A favourite in the city whether it be for lunch, dinner or even better as reception venue. 

Great food, great drinks (plus great scotch selection) and atmosphere. 

The only thing to consider is the access to the one elevator (if you ask you will get the story of what the original plan was) so if planning a large gathering or reception you could experience a bottle neck."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my girlfriends because one of them won three free oysters. So naturally, the first thing we looked at on the menu were the oysters. We went for the most expensive oyster (don't remember the name) because....well, because it's free so why not?! 

Next, we went on to decide what we wanted for our main meal. This is when we came across some issues:
1) They didn't label appetizer, main entree, etc so we were uncertain about portion size
2) They had a lot of market price selection on their menu so I had to annoying ask the waitress a million questions
3) Why didn't they write the market price item on the blackboard in their restaurant? Instead, they wasted the space by rewriting the same menu that's on their printed menu. 
4) I paid over $20 for a scallop dish that contained ONE very delicious and well cooked scallop at a very expensive price. Even the priciest restaurant in town would have at least two scallops for that price!

So we're done our main meals and we were debating if we wanted dessert and possibly get disappointed again. Surprisingly enough, the dessert was at a decent price (again, price was not indicated on the menu and we had to wait for the bill and cross our fingers), the portion was huge and delicious. 

Moral of the story? Just order dessert here."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food! Location is odd, but the atmosphere is decent, felt like I was in the Hamptons!"}
{"text":"Bear with me, it wasn't a 1 star experience but this restaurant does not deserve the 4 star rating it has. The food is beautiful but I promise you'll leave hungry. The service was okay but the food is trash 5 of 8 us did not like our food. We came here starving but after 2 hours, 2 people sent their food back, 2 of us gave up halfway and 1 person was just left still hungry because their meal wasn't as big as promised. The menu doesn't describe anything accurately and neither do the waiters. We sat upstairs where everything is so expensive and the pork belly meal is 100% fat, the brown rice risotto would have made a good side but is inedible as a main. The lobster is a mushy pasta soup, NOT a whole lobster as promised. The duck was sent back because it wasn't cooked and the fish was not as big as expected. The waitress was professional but didn't offer a solution when we sent food back, she recommended a drink that wasn't liked and was left full but never followed up."}
{"text":"Long overdue review of the Chase! I came here last week for Winterlicious with my friends. I was excited to try the Chase since I heard great reviews. 

First off - I heard the restaurant has multiple floors. We were seated on the main floor. Love the decor, modern and sleek design. They have a lot of staff running around serving people and Managers walking around to check in on guests. Great customer service. 

I ordered the salmon tartare to start. It was good but I didn't like the bread/crackers that came with it. It was a chewy and crunchy type of bread if that makes sense. I wish they served it with just a crisp bread or cracker. For my main I ordered the Arctic char. Delicious and cooked wonderfully. Loved it. The cabbage I wasn't a big fan of but overall the dish was excellent. Finally for dessert we all wanted chocolate cake because it sounded amazing! But when we got it, it was super dry like a muffin. We were hoping for a super moist chocolate cake but got a dark chocolate muffin with caramel popcorn and peanut ice cream. The ice cream was delicious but it couldn't save this chocolate cupcake/muffin thing. The manager checked up on us and we gave him our honest opinion - not a fan of the chocolate cake. And so he said he would bring out another dessert for us to share (so nice and made up for it)! So we end up sharing the apple donut with caramel sauce. 

Those who are getting the dessert, get the donut, it was recommended by our server but of course me loving chocolate I ordered the wrong thing. It's not a bread donut. More like a cake style donut with caramel drizzled on the plate. 

I would love to come back to the chase. Hope they do summerlicious!"}
{"text":"The first impression of the restaurant was great, I like the lighting and decor, it was very posh and intimate at the same time. But then it was kind of downhill from then on...

Came here for Summerlicious dinner $38
First course I ordered the Tomato Gazpacho, it was so salty! It was impossible to take more than a couple of bites. The waiter came to the table seeing that I barely touched the soup, he offered me to try the other option: the crispy oyster. And this was quite tasty. The breading was very greasy, but goes well with the cabbage salad it came with. 

For the main, I had the Grilled Albacore, it was absolutely horrible. Barely any char marks on the fish and chewy, I had such hard time cutting the fish apart. The worst part was that it was stone cold...it tastes like it was barely grilled and was left in the fridge ..

Dessert I had the blueberry crumble. It was too sweet for my taste.. It was basically a pool of blueberry sauce and pieces of oatmeal cookies on top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

The service was also extremely slow, but friendly to have offered me different plate for appetizer and remade the main."}
{"text":"Came here Friday evening for the first time and left with a really good first impression! 

I had resos with a group of 6 at 7:30. When my party and I arrived, our table was ready and we were seated promptly on the first floor. 

It was very dimly lit inside, but you can still make out the beautiful nautical decor and the live acoustic performer made the ambiance more intimate. 

We ordered the Bay Platter to share and I got the Albacore Tuna as my entree. The bay platter had a variety of fresh seafood (oysters, clams, shrimp, a whole lobster and more) served with your standard sauce and garnishes. It was good but nothing outstanding. If you like variety I would suggest the bay platter, otherwise I would just stick with the oyster platter as its more worth the $ .

As for my Albacore Tuna entree, I was really happy with it. It was four pieces of tuna seared on the outside and served on top of a medley of vegetables. The potatoes on the bottom were really flavorful and tasty. 

The service was fantastic. Our server was attentive, our water glasses were always full without having to ask, overall was really pleased with their service. 

I also wanted to mention that the live performer made the night 10x better! He did acoustic covers, as well as took some of the dining guest requests. I would really recommend coming here Thursday and Friday nights when he is there."}
{"text":"A friend organized a Monday night $30 per person AYCE oyster night.. Chase didn't disappoint!!!

Made RSVP for 10 people at 8pm, sat down and was told Kushi was sold out.. They served Malpeque oysters instead.. The oysters really were all you can eat, I had just over 100 oysters for $30... Hence a 5 star rating.

Towards the end, they ran out of Malpeque and started serving us Komamoto's which I didn't like but are more expensive oysters...

We also ordered tried many of the other items on the menu, all were pretty tasty. But, $30pp for truly all you can eat oysters was unbelievable!! We asked the bills to be separate, my bill for 1 person came up to $130 including tip, so other items are pretty pricy (but I definitely good my money's worth and more). Overall a great experience! Bread was really good too.. - should definitely ask for it! 

Would totally recommend Monday Oyster night and a \"special occasion dinner\" consider the plating, service, and food quality."}
{"text":"Not as good as Rodney's. People go here when they can't get a table at The Chase upstairs.

I got food poisoning from here. Just after our dessert came, I ran to the restroom and puked out my whole dinner. With that said, I don't believe they have a dirty kitchen. I think I just had a bad piece.

I do find the Avocado & Crab roll to be delicious and the only thing I recommend."}
{"text":"You wanna feel like a baller? Come here. I read online that this was a rooftop dining restaurant, but the day we went, it rained so the patio was closed. And it's only on the 5th floor. So too bad with that misinformation, but the inside is more than gorgeous enough to make up for it. We had the diamond bay platter and it was amazing. If you were to choose your oysters, for for 100% Atlantic ocean ones. The Pacific oysters are large sure, but the flavor on the ones from the east? Fantastic. Fantastic. Fantastic. The clams in garlic were fire. The curried crab avocado?? Whoa! Man, it was worth every penny. And the service is bar none the greatest. The masala martini was magical too. Yup, I said it. Magical."}
{"text":"We dropped in for a quick lunch at The Chase this week. It is an interesting experience since the dining room is divided between the first and fifth floors. I used to enjoy Little Fin from the same group (and not sure why they closed a unique restaurant to replace it with yet another hamburger joint) and The Chase delivered.
Due to a lack of reservation we were accommodated at the bar on the fifth floor. I had the beef tartar and it was quite good. There is an emphasis on libations and its menu, but we passed. Based on this experience I should be back to try what they are best known for: oysters.
For now the service was polite, the hostess and coat check girl polite and the atmosphere loud and busy. I do like their clean ambiance that is mixed with a classic vibe. The fifth floor has glass walls and a semi-view of the surroundings so enjoy."}
{"text":"Ok - I have now been to the restaurant well over 20 times.  It is close and everyone I lunch with wants to go.  Having been there as much as I have, I now regularly get free amuse bouche and am seated in the same great spot near the window. 

Things have really changed here.  I eat out almost every day for business and The Chase is now my absolute favorite. Not just the perks either--the service and food are now absolutely tops.  There is no bad dish, but the Octopus, avocado roll and big eye tuna are among the best.  The service is quiet and attentive and not pretentious or overbearing.  It's now under a new general manager and I wonder if that had a hand in the change, or whether the place has simply grown up.  Either way, a great place for a swanky meal."}
{"text":"3.5 stars with an additional 1/2 star for service

You have to plan ahead to get a dinner reservation at peak times. Luckily for us, we were able to snag a table on a weeknight a day in advance. We were greeted with warmth from the front desk staff and you can peek into the kitchen as you step in which was cool. We were running late but they had us seated right away. First, we looked at the rather limited cocktail menu and apprehensively ordered some of those expensive cocktails. We were so glad that they turned out to be so good (got our money's worth). I think their bartender recently won some competition and he truly knows his craft. 

We ordered a bunch of food items from the menu (mostly appetizers). Unfortunately for us they all came out in a hurry which was a slight blemish on the part of our server. We requested that they send some dishes back to the kitchen since we were not ready to take it all in at the same time and they obliged. Our server was very well informed and also stopped by our table to inquire about the dish we were served. 

Our favorite bites of the night were the oyster po'boy sliders (why are they so tiny?) and the octopus. The octopus is a complex dish but I loved the combination of the harissa and salsa verde (perfect for my palate). The king crab rosti was nothing memorable and it left a sour after taste. Moreover, for 32 bucks I would consider it rather expensive for what it's worth. We also ordered a side of skinny fries (highly recommended even if you are on a diet :)) which we really enjoyed dipping in some herbacious aioli. 

For dessert we had the angel food cake with burnt marshmallow crust which was very light and fluffy. 

Overall, this place has an upscale yet casual vibe. It also has the right acoustics since we never really felt it was loud to distract our conversation. We left a decent tip since the service was so good. We will definitely come back to try the more upscale place upstairs."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a restaurant in a while, so looked this one up in web first. They said it was one of the Top 25 in Toronto and it DIDN'T DISAPPOINT. It was amazing! From the restaurant ambiance to the background music, to the service, it was great. We got a dozen oysters to share-YUM!!!! Followed by the oyster po'boy sliders and tuna nachos. It was a great way to start the meal. We got the FRIED chicken for entree....I'm not a fried chicken fan but this rocked! Especially in combo with the homemade slaw. Finally we got a strawberry cheesecake sundae to share. What a great finish!  I got the Fairwater as a drink and it was a great compliment to the meal. I would definitely come back, especially if in the mood for oysters and seafood!"}
{"text":"I had a client from Vancouver meet me at Chase.   He was at Chase and thought another visit would be worth the time and money.  Not the case.  Food mediocre at best.  The duck was cold, overly fatty and inedible.  My colleague had the tartar.  He could not finish as it was not spiced properly.  The server got into an argument over our wine choice.   Not a good evening.  My wife goes to Chase with her  friends and said that the last couple of times the quality was slipping.   I won't go back."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious with 3 other friends and we were super disappointed...but the dessert in the end made up for it.

The presentation of the food was gorgeous. Really enjoyed the combintion of the different ingredients. But the biggest issue i had was the food being way too salty. I had to down 1-2 glass full of water after every course, especially the main course. The salt unfortunately overpowered the amazing seafood taste. We also found huge rocks inside the clams of our main course.

The dessert on the other hand was pretty awesome. We ordered all three of the desserts and none of us were disappointed."}
{"text":"The Chase was a fabulous place to start off our culinary exploration of a great city. It was my first time in Toronto -- actually, first time in Canada altogether, so I had picked up a copy of Toronto Life to help guide me. That's where I found the Chase, and after verifying with the Yelp community, decided to give it a try. Had initially tried to get a table upstairs with no luck, but was just as happy to be downstairs, more my style anyway. Great vibe, fabulous service and everything we had was fantastic. We started with not one but two rounds of oysters & tiger shrimp -- the fresh shaved horseradish was such a nice touch. Almost too pretty to eat. The cocktail sauce and red wine sauce were equally delicious. 

After that we moved on to the big eye tuna nachos. Bring me 7 more plates of that please. Something about the taro root chip was so interesting and downright divine, not to mention the fresh tuna and glorious flavor accents. Also had the mussels, which were were just how I like them, doused in a delicious garlic/wine sauce and of course, served with bread for sopping up that goodness. Oh, and the cocktails. Port of Call. Just do it. 

It's also worth noting that not only did we have a great server, but she pretty much planned out our entire next day for us with add'l things to do, see and eat. It's always refreshing to see people passionate about their city, and she wasted no time mapping out an itinerary for us. We took many of her recommendations and were not disappointed! Next time we come back we'll definitely be making a trip to the Chase so I can see what this fried chicken is all about :-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I were really excited to try the Chase, and came out with mixed reviews. 

PROS: 
1) The restaurant is beautiful, with huge windows, high ceilings and a Parisian chic decor mixed with a casual nautical feel. We loved hanging out in the restaurant! 
2) Our server Corynne was pleasant, attentive and coursed our menu out exactly as we wished, which was nice!! The food also came out in very admirable times, and we were mise'd with every course. We were very well taken care of, service wise!
3) The cod tacos we ordered were terrific. 

CONS: 
1) FOOD!  The Winterlicious menu was far less delicious than the a la carte items we ordered, and those weren't even home runs. Isn't the whole point of Winterlicious to try and entice new customers with the set menu? Our pasta dish was cold and flavourless (I had to ask for two servings of Parmesan cheese just to get any sort of a taste going), and the Boston Cream Pie was, get this, DRY!!! How is this possible for a Boston Cream Pie? It was 70% dry cake and I could barely taste or see the custard! I don't know if we got an old piece or what, but that is quite a feat to make a cream pie DRY! Have I said DRY enough? The lobster roll was good, but for $26 a roll, a couple more chunks would have been nice. We had a lot of milk bread leftover with no lobster. 
2) Our cocktails were fine, but very drably presented, and nothing special for $16 a pop. The cocktail list was also extremely limited, as was the wine list. 

Maybe we came on an off night, but we were not too enthused with the food, which should always be the star, in our humble opinion."}
{"text":"Great food and really good service.

Had some oysters rockafeller that was not a menu item (special order), probably best thing i ordered in 2016.

Tried the lobster roll and burger which were very good. The potato wedges that came with them were amazing, maybe best i ever had.

The cod taco app is also very good.

The restaurant itself is also very nicely decorated and the service is outstandingly good. Its a bit expensive but worth it, lets just say $100 per person average if your drinking alcohol and having appetizers."}
{"text":"Reservation: Dec.1.2017 @ 8pm.


I contacted the restaurant 46 days prior to my requested reservation date. When I spoke to the hostess she informed me that the restaurant only takes reservations up to 30 days in advance.  Not a problem, on November 1st, I contacted the restaurant and made my booking. I informed the hostess that one of my guests had a gluten allergy and I would like to be seated in the dining room section. She told me not a problem.

I arrived at 8:04pm for my reservation. The hostess informed me that my guests were at the bar and my table would be available shortly.
At 8:26pm I went to the hostess requesting an update for my table. She stated that my table is still not available and the clients who are currently seated at my table are still consuming their mains. She also informs that they have been at the table since 5:30pm. 
She then asks me if she can show me some availability, I agree. One table was available in the lounge, which I declined. The second table was also in the lounge area 5 steps away from the restroom. Once again I decline. 
The hostess then tells me she will get us a table as soon as possible.
At 8:58pm I was done waiting for my table, I requested the hostess to speak with the GM.
The GM came to speak with me. All he kept on saying was that they were very sorry. Over 9 times. At that point, he started to sound condescending simply saying the words instead of rectifying the situation and smoothing it out.
The GM said to me he will be back and look into the situation.
At 9:04pm he informs me that he has a table for me and my guests, I ask is it available now or soon? He had the audacity to say to me that they were kicking people out of the table to accommodate me. Trying to make me feel guilty as if it's my fault those guests were being kicked out.
At 9:07pm we finally sat down. Food as always is exceptional, service was good but definitely, the server was trying to compensate for the extremely long wait. So, unfortunately, it came off as unauthentic.
I never saw the GM again after my guests and I sat down. He never came to check up on us.
When I received the bill I took the assumption that I would be compensated for waiting over an hour to be seated. I was definitely wrong. Every drink, appetizer, and main was on the bill. 
Simply that shows me that the GM and the restaurant could not care less about making a client wait over an hour for his reserved table he made a month in advance or any discrepancy they have made.

This whole fiasco ruined my Christmas staff party and holiday spirits with my staff. The only saving grace about the restaurant is the food."}
{"text":"I am sorry I entrusted my dad's 70th birthday dinner to this restaurant.

Look don't get me wrong. Most of the food was great. My parents certainly enjoyed the dishes they picked, as well as the appetizers.

But after the appetizer course is when things started to get off course. It took an exceedingly long time to get our main dishes. I believe it was about 20-25 minutes. But hey, they're busy right?

Sure. But then I began eating the Panroast (seafood broth with lobster, shrimp, clams, mussels, oysters). Coincidentally, I believe it was the most expensive main dish at $58. I found these spherical white objects in the broth. I couldn't fork them, so I swept them up with my fork. They were crunchy. I couldn't figure out what they were.

After I finished, I asked one of the staff what they were supposed to be. He said potatoes. Yup - the potatoes were so undercooked that they were literally crunchy. Raw potatoes at an upscale restaurant.

I could forgive the long wait and the uncooked potatoes (should I?), but what really got to me was their lack of acknowledgement of my fathers 70th birthday. When prompted by OpenTable to enter any special occasions being celebrated, I mentioned that it's my father's 70th birthday. 

Now perhaps my experience is not common, but typically such an early alert to the restaurant results in some sort of acknowledgment - a token simple dessert with a candle so we can sing Happy Birthday. It's not much, and it's not about the dessert, but about providing the context for the family to celebrate the occasion. My father got no candle on his 70th birthday. And we didn't get to sing for him. I guess we'll do it tomorrow.

Silly? Maybe. It didn't feel like it to be honest. I felt like my father as robbed of a small but significant part of his birthday celebration.

But again maybe the staff was too busy. Or maybe the hostesses didn't alert the wait staff like they were supposed to. They seemed so pre-occupied with comparing the jewelry they were wearing, that they even failed to offer a simple \"Thank you - bye!\" as we walked out the door. 

Thanks \"The Chase\". I'll go chase after another establishment with which to entrust my family's special occasions."}
{"text":"Very attentive staff.  Excellent food.  Had a Buffalo Mozzarella appetizer that was delightful.  Very fresh and well accompanied. Then a dry aged ribeye for two.  The meat was perfectly done and very flavorful. A side of gnocchi was done just right and came in a interesting sauce with fresh peas.  The peas were so good even someone who hated peas wouldn't be able to pass them up. Dessert was  strawberry cheesecake, but again the preparation and presentation were novel and delightful.  While this is a very expensive place, the kind where aficionados of $1000 bottles of wine will have several to select from, I feel the quality of the food was top notch and the quality and preparation fully justified the prices."}
{"text":"I feel very strongly about the three points I'm about to make...

1. Food
Solid for the most part. Had 4 courses and 2/4 were spot on perfect--would 1000% order it if I came here again. 2/4 was average.

2. Service
The same kind of service you'd expect at a diner chain like Joey's, Moxie's or any one of those kinds of restaurants. Rushy, non-attentive, unmemorable and unacceptable from a restaurant that's demanding top notch prices.

3. Price
WAY OVER-PRICED! I've had a 2 michelin star dinner in Vegas that was only slightly more than this restaurant. Get over yourself, Chase!!!

------------- WARNING FOR GROUPS -------------

If you're a group of 8 or more, I highly suggest you stay away from this place. You will be charged an automatic 20% gratuity. And on top of that, you will be charged TAX ON that 20% automatic gratuity. Highway f****** robbery. 

Funny story about their fixed menu for groups:
It is cheaper to order EACH of their fixed menu dishes from their regular menu than it is to order from their fixed menu price. So if you chose menu items A, B, D and F from their fixed menus, you'd pay X amount. But if you ordered the exact same items from their regular menu, you'd pay less. Highway f****** robbery. 

-------------------------------------------------------------

Owners of Chase--I welcome you to address my concerns publicly and to prove me wrong."}
{"text":"Went for winterliscious for lunch and was not impressed.  

Had salmon tartar as an appetizer, which was good.  No complaints there.  

For the main, had the arctic char.  It was quite greasy, probably because the butter or oil they cooked it in was not hot enough.  The skin was rubbery and inedible.  The red cabbage was excellent actually and not overly sweetened which you find in some restaurants.

For dessert, had the donut, which was good, except for the cold apple filling.

Friends have eaten here before and said it's good, so could have just been a bad winterliscious experience, hard to know."}
{"text":"The experience for me was quite average. As a huge seafood fan, I had high expectations for this place. I absolutely loved how the place was decorated! They had huge sails hung up in the ceiling with nice light blue furniture giving a sense of the ocean. However, I was as impressed with the food as the interior design. 

The experience started quite well with the appetizers. The \"Bigeye Tuna Nachos\" was quite nice. The tuna was light yet flavourful and both the nachos and the shaved carrots added a nice crunch to the texture of the dish. Quite pleased as I would give this dish a 4 to 4.5 stars out of 5. 

For the main course, I had gotten the fresh catch of the day. I was told by my server that the texture and flavour of the fish resembled that of the sea bass. When the dish arrived, I had a bad feeling that this was not what I had expected. Nevertheless, I love fish so I was not too picky. The fish was overcooked, flakey and had a strong \"fishy\" flavour to it. I was looking for something on the plate to balance the 'fishy' taste, but there was only coleslaw left since I already ate the grains (My asian genes kicked in and went for the grains first) :\"( 

I did not have a great experience like most of the people on yelp did, but I think it may be due to my poor decisions in ordering. I would definitely be willing to give this place another try. Hope your experience and my next one will be better!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect. Food, service, decor, wine list. Everything is top notch. Expensive but worth EVERY penny. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The Chase Fish & Oyster Restaurant

Took my gf here recently and didn't regret it.  They have a small nice outdoor patio if you enjoy outdoor seating and a more posh interior dining area if you're looking for a quit date, family, or business experience.   Our waitress was Lindsey and she was fantastic attentive knowledgeable and friendly with the right amount of service so you felt taken care of but not hounded on.  The only blemish was the washrooms which are interestingly designed in the single stall setup however that night one of the sinks in the men's wasn't working.  We took this up with a maitre'd and he promised to look into this which is nice.  My gf didn't like her cocktail and our server offered to take it off the bill which I found going the extra mile to make for a fantastic dining experience.   Very reasonably price at 10-15 apps and 20-30s mains

I tried the octopus on recommendation from other yelpers and it was a nice appetizer which can also be made into a main if you want to up size it.

They have a nice daily specials menu however that night it was just appetizers as special so I had the salmon while my gf had the 1.5lbs mussels. 

 They have a daily special for a 1lb lobster which is served daily.

If you're making a reservation make sure you state to the hostess if you are looking for The Chase fish and oyster or just The Chase which is upstairs accessed by an elevator inside and has a lovely outdoor rooftop patio.

The restaurant is accessed via an entrance in the back of a side alley and has an optional valet service which is 20 dollars.  That night they had regular taxi service waiting outside for those planning on drinking a bit more than normal

Happy yelping"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fabulous Winterlicious lunch today.  It was absolutely flawless, everything from the food, value and service!  Winterlicious runs until Feb. 8, so if you're interested, you should definitely consider coming here.  It's a 3 course Prix Fixe lunch for $28.

It was top notch service starting with our server who was very helpful and the staffs were super attentive with clearing our plates and refilling our water.  I was also very impressed with the timing between each course.   As a starter, my friends and I selected the seafood salad which had a good variety of shrimp, mussels and squid which was delicious.   We also got the same main course which was the sea bream fillet....perfectly pan fried and it was so flavourful with olives, capers, polenta and tomato sauce.  For dessert, we ended up picking all 3 selections - bombolone (like donut), espresso cake and limoncello posset (like pudding).  These were all very good dessert but we all thought the cake was our favourite!

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am really impressed with this resturant. Had a business lunch and all of us agreed, this was our favourite lunch spot in Toronto. Highly Recommended. Chocolate dessert is a must with double espresso."}
{"text":"My wife and I are huge seafood eaters and when we decided to travel to Toronto for a weekend getaway we decided to look for the best seafood restaurant in town. After some research we found Chase and decided to book a dinner on our last night of the trip. We arrived and the exterior has the Midtown New York feel with the brick walls and modern exteriors. 

We were seated right away and the staff were very friendly and quick, however when we were given the menu, both of us were a little taken back on how limited the menu seems. As usual we decided to order several appetizers to share, which included the haidacore  tuna nachos, the octopus, oysters sliders, and a warm clam chowder. The positives of the meal were the tuna nachos, with the extra rear and fresh tuna on top crisp mini tortilla chips topped with a light wasabi mayo. The oyster slider was pretty good but it had way too much breading for my taste. 

The clam chowder was very creamy with good chunks of oysters, while the octopus dish was the biggest disappointment. The octopus was too chewy and flavorless and I didn't like the combination of the sausage creating too much contrast. We also ordered some biscuits with honey and butter, which really hit the right spots, very moist. I had a lot of expectation for this restaurant, the service was on par but some of the food lacked the flavors I have grown custom to. Its very similar to Devon in Miami, but I would of prefer more my hometown restaurant."}
{"text":"I Never write reviews but I had to write this on our bad experience. My wife took me for my Birthday and told the restaurant it was a special birthday. I should have know when I sat down and the table was wobbly and I asked someone that I thought was our waiter if they could fix it and he said no problem and then I never saw him again, it wasn't going to be a good meal! We sat at our table for 10 mins before our waiter came and I asked him if he could fix the table. He told me some line about the table are balanced every night and I guess they missed this one....Oh Right!...Poof he was gone and back 10 mins later he's back to fix our table. We final ordered drinks, they came 15mins later and then we ordered our appetizers and meal. Our waiter was gone and did not see him for another 18mins with our appetizers. At this point, we have been there for approximately 52mins and we just got our appetizers.I ordered then Branzino fish, my waiter came back and told me it was sold out. ( HOW DOES A SEAFOOD RESTAURANT THAT ISN'T THAT BUSY RUN OUT OF FISH ON A SATURDAY NIGHT AT 7:45 ) We had our seafood appetizer that was very average at best! The Oysters were good, Give them credit for that. After we were done our appetizers, we waited for another 18 mins for our main course to come.  They arrived and our plates were hot and our food was Cold. We were able to flag down our waiter and sent our meals back. 15mins later our new meals came out and they were also cold, But the plates were hot. We told our waiter again and he apologized and told me he would speak to the manager. We ate what we could and asked for the bill. They tried to bring our some other appetizers for us to make up for the problems. I just wanted to get out of there.  The manager walked by the table several times and didn't say a word to us. In any quality restaurant if you have a problem with a customer meal the manager comes over to apologize, Not walk by the table serval times and not say anything. I found this place very disorganized. Don't waste your money, there are better restaurants in the city with better food and better service. Thanks for a BAD BIRTHDAY DINNER!!!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at the Chase Fish and Oyster downstairs and it was an absolutely delicious meal from start to finish.  The kitchen was running a bit behind and our server brought us the octopus as an appetizer on the house. We had ordered the  bay platter as an appetizer, I was already full by the time We had finished it. Plenty on the platter to please everyone!  I ordered the Halibut and it was delicious.  Everything was excellent. The ambience was great here and Theservice was exceptional. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Over the holidays, I stuffed myself with food as usual. One of the dinners I had was at The Chase Fish and Oyster near Queen and Yonge. Not to be mistaken with The Chase, The Chase Fish and Oyster is the lesser expensive restaurant of the two within the same building. However, prices are still pretty steep. My foodie friend chose this restaurant for our holiday gathering. Although The Chase Fish and Oyster was out of my budget, I was willing to try it at least once.

The menu selection was pretty limited. My main concern was that the portions were going to come out small. The waiter recommended that my friend and I split the Clambake instead of ordering our own dish (around $64). A Clambake is basically a huge bowl with everything seafood in it (lobster, crab, fish, clams, etc.). He told us it was the best bang for our buck and that the portions were going to be filling. He was definitely right about the portion size. My friend and I tried to evenly split the Clambake and we were both stuffed by the end of it.

I called the restaurant to double check the price for this review. I was told it was $50 although when I went, I'm sure it was around $64. I'm unsure if the price changed due to the availability of the ingredients being used in the Clambake or if it was the lunch time price (I called during lunch).

Either way, once at The Chase Fish and Oyster was enough for me. The food was good (nothing I was crazy for though), but I would not come back if I have to pay out of my own pocket again. If you work for a company that takes out clients and foots the bill, then you could give this seafood restaurant a shot."}
{"text":"The Arctic char is by far my favorite main course.  Between the food, service and ambience it's really my seafood \"go to\" downtown.  This is a very well executed restaurant."}
{"text":"Knowlegable staff.... Nice seafood resturant.   
Last visit was lunch during summerious.  We sat on the ground floor seating.. It was okay. But I requested to sit at the upstair location and it was much nicer than downstairs....  Decoration was classic with modern touch.  High ceiling make you feel roomy.  Staff is very knoelagble on explaining our oyster order.  We ordered a seasonal whole black cod.  The fish was fresh and done well.  We love to taste and the presentation.  The dish has two parts. First they will being the fish to your table for a look, then the server will debone it and present it to you again.  My white boyfrind love this idea of debone it.  However, I would prefer if they ask if I want the rest after they fillet the fish including my favorite skin and head.  
It is a bit pricy but it is a great place for seafood.  Also the patio is one of the best in town with a great view."}
{"text":"This review is based on just the service.
Originally my boyfriend and I were booked for Winterlicious. After being seated for 5 mins unattended, the fire alarm went off. How lucky eh? We spotted the staff letting tables know what was going on, but no one came to our table. We continued to sit through the alarm and after another 5 minutes our server finally came to ask if we were ready to order, not addressing the alarm issue. It wasn't until we asked, the waiter said he will get more information and let us know. He did not come back. Not knowing when the alarm would stop, we just decided to leave.

Not the kind of service I was expecting at a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"This place is great. Just came back from a fantastic lunch. Just a note of clarification, there are 2 restaurants, The Chase Fish & Oyster is street level and The Chase is a more formal restaurant on the 5th floor. Great food, service was a bit rocky, but its their third day... nothing that can't be fixed. 

Crab appetizer is amazing and the strawberry dessert was delicious. 

A welcome venue in the downtown core. The patio on the 5th floor is private and stunning."}
{"text":"This review is for the downstairs of The Chase. I think it's named slightly different. The Chase Fish and Oysters?

Food:
Barbecue broccoli: 3 stars
Bay platter: 2.5 stars
Key lime cake: 5 stars

I thought the barbecue broccoli was alright. My friend really enjoyed the broccoli relish, but I found it a little tasteless and I wasn't even sure what it was until I reviewed the menu just now. There was also crispy chicken skins?! I thought it was just deep fried dough around the broccoli, but it did taste great. Not a bad appetizer but best broccoli award still goes to the broccoli yakitori at Yokohama. 
Bay platter was really just an overpriced seafood platter. I think I was too hyped up about it and it led to disappointment. The only remarkable parts of the Bay platter were the clams and the tuna. The raw tuna was prepared with some sort of sesame oil and it was delicious! Clams and oysters were fresh and nicely shucked. A few clams had some sand in it but not really an issue. Lobster was a good size but no seasoning whatsoever, just cold plain lobster. Menu says there is crab but what they really mean is a chunk of 3 crab legs...not A crab. Both the lobster and the crab was underwhelming. Scallops came as a ceviche and there wasn't much of it. I think among the 3 of us, we each got 1-2 small pieces of scallop. For $110, you're really just paying for the privilege of fine dining. 
Key lime cake was AMAZING! Never really had key lime anything before but I might start now after this cake. Soft and creamy. Slightly tangy with just a hint of lime. I would say this was the best part of the meal. 

Ambiance: 4 stars
Very nice and classy interior. We changed our reservations from upstairs to downstairs so they could only accommodate us with a table at the lounge and the lounge was nice so no complaints. High wooden tables and chairs. The only odd thing is the entrance. It's located down an alley way on the side of the patio. 

Service: 4 stars
Our waitress was wonderful. Friendly and on top of things. Our table was always cleared with each new item being served. Water was refilled periodically. We actually had another gentleman who served us near the beginning and he was also very helpful with the menu. Great service overall."}
{"text":"Yummy food, Beautiful restaurant, excellent service. Portions were small so do not come too hungry.

We started with the crab avocado roll and it was delicious. Then we got the octopus and I have personally never tasted octopus like this one so it was amazing. The flavours were rich. Also, we got the lobster hot pot, which was good but not great compared to the last two dishes. Finally for dessert we got the hazelnut bomb and it was melt in your mouth good.

Overall, I was satisifed throughout!"}
{"text":"Went back with my vegetarian friend. I was blown away. Beet salad is unreal (3 kinds of beets). Broccoli is fucking delicious, seasoned with all kinds of delicious shit. Fries were good again, got a couple tasty cheese dishes. Ricotta is very very light, if you like it fluffy and substanceless as fuck, you're in luck. If you like good food and a nice setting this place is amazing. I keep ending up there in hats, I feel underdressed, but no one has given me a proper stink eye yet. 

My homie ordered the 'Gin' drink. Best drink I've ever tried. It was preposterous. 

Took the focaccia bread instructions this time, it is sweet cheesy crunchy craziness."}
{"text":"Good restaurant in a beautiful space. Got the market fish (red snapper) and it was an entire fish, head and all! Was delicious, would recommend. The server was really kind - she recommended something to a colleague that my colleague didn't end up liking, so she gave her a complimentary appetizer."}
{"text":"so i got fired from my job the other day and my best friend said \"let me take you out to lunch for some therapy,\" ie. wine in the afternoon...yes! so i met her downtown and she said \"do you feel like oysters? and i'm like \"just hold my head back and open my mouth and let the booze flow in.\" oysters? really? is that even food? my stomach is in a huge knot so oysters will work just fine because they go down so easy. i do love an oyster on a normal day btw, i am a swallower.
so we got there, great atmosphere, nice and bright and airy, we bellied up to the bar and was right away made at home by the dudes who worked there. we ordered wine, and some oysters and the fried chicken....fried chicken and oyster might be my new favourite thing EVAR. 
also protip: whenever you go to a restaurant,  ALWAYS opt to sit at the bar and not a table and if you are having a case of the sads, chances are the bartender will be the cheapest therapist you will ever get. the chase did not disappoint.
the shucker, so sweet, gave us a lesson in how different kinds of oysters, who knew there were so many kinds? and without a doubt, and i have sucked back many an oyster, these were the best i've ever had.
and the fried chicken? i can't even talk about it. there are no words.
this is my favourite restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"I've been to the chase twice now; once for regular dinner and once for summerlicious, and I can't say this is a fantastic restaurant. 

It's located in prime downtown core where all the suits love to see and be seen, and has upscale dining up and down from their staff to their decoration. That's great, it's a lovely place and the ambiance is nice. 

However their food is, at best, decent. When I came for dinner, we ordered the usual selection of fish and ocean, oysters, shrimp, mussels. I don't think anything blew my mind or stood out. I also got a main which I think was a fish dish.. Also was decent but not standout. 

I went to their lunchtime summerlicious which is at the highest tier for lunch, 28$. I got the rolled crab cakes, shrimp po-boys and a selection of desserts. The po boy was quite good, the crab cake was pretty bland and the dessert was decent. Again, nothing to write home about though. 

If you want to spend some serious cash and impress someone, sure go to the chase but if you're looking for quality seafood, I think there are a lot more options out there for cheaper."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been here.  The food is great (a little on the small size - portion-wise), the restaurant is well-designed and modern (without being cold), and the staff is always friendly.

This time, my main disappointment:  I asked for a glass of wine, and told the waiter to bring me one that he recommended.  I do this all the time, and trust that they aren't going to attempt to unknowingly \"up-sell\" me to the most expensive glass.  And, that had never happened to me before - until now.

When I got the bill, I was surprised he had chosen a $20 glass!  I guess it's my fault, for assuming...

I haven't decided, if I'll go back."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious and experience was nothing but a disappointment. Food had a weird taste to it. Service was almost non-existent as we almost had to beg to be paid attention. 

The thing i cannot get over is their act of false advertising. On their social media they showed this dish of broccoli soup which in reality looks like a cheap beat down version. I asked the waiter where the octopus bits went and he told me that they were all in the soup. After digging through the soup with my spoon i found two tiny pieces of what believed was traces of octopus even existed in this soup. Not impressed."}
{"text":"fantastic restaurant and great fresh seafood. Lots of oysters to choose from with toppings.  one of my favorite digs downtown.  

good wine list and nice selection of beers."}
{"text":"Love love love The Chase. Our server was really attentive and extremely knowledgable about everything. Everything the wine list to the menu he answered all questions in detail. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the food is great. I loved the New Brunswick oysters we ordered and the ribeye for two with white truffle shavings on top. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night with a group of co-workers. We had a reservation for 9PM but arrived late due to issues finding the correct address. We were promptly seated and given menus. I ordered the veal -- it came with gnocchi, a minuscule crab leg and maybe 2 tablespoons of kale salad. I had high expectations for this place, I've heard a lot of good reviews. It appears to be very elegant and upscale but unfortunately, our server Dylan, did not portray that very well. He did not seem very thrilled to be serving us. My co-workers and I asked to have our bill separated and he seemed rather annoyed, oh we must have inconvenienced him. He was rude in answering our questions and slammed the debit machine on the table when one of my co-workers told him she was paying cash. I understand that it was near closing time, but we weren't even close to being the last guests in the restaurant. There were several other tables. And with such a high price point, I expect the service to be top-notch, which it definitely was not. 

Overall: 
Food - 7/10
Service - 4/10 thanks to Dylan, I repeat, DYLAN. The other waiters were good, they removed crumbs in between plates and refilled our drinks often.
Atmosphere - 10/10 

However, 10/10 will NOT be coming back. I think I would have been more satisfied with a $3 hot dog down the street."}
{"text":"The Chase Fish  & Oyster is beautiful. 

The interior is just stunning, remind me of Manhattan and the price to match too.

We ordered:

3 each of Shigoku ($3.75), Mallet ($3.50) and Cascumpec ($3.80)
- Oysters! Fresh, tasty, delicious oysters!
- I savour them slowly with a touch of freshly grind horseradish and lemon juice
- There were no prices on the chalkboard and I really have no idea how much they cost unless one ask or see the charge on the final bill. But I know they were not cheap and not my $1 oyster specials!

Summer Chowder ($13)
- clams, mussels, smoked sturgeon, sweet corn, peas, whipped mascarpone
- light and refreshing! Love the seafood combination and serving was quite generous!

Our waitress was amazing and professional! Split our order of Chowder without requesting and check on us frequently and making sure we have a good time!

Maybe I come back and enjoy some oysters on the patio when all the constructions are done... but at this price point and how many oysters I would like to eat, it might be awhile....."}
{"text":"The oysters are delicious and the mains are generally good. I had a slight problem with my main dish tasting like orange juice but that was complimentary. The servers were polite and cordial. Little did we know that when we arrived, the upstairs becomes a little bit of nightclub on weekends. I've heard that Chase servers can be rude if you don't look well dressed, but I suppose that's an issue at any upper class establishment. It's good for date nights."}
{"text":"Over priced and  the level of servie has fallen  since they first opened. They were out of green tea and could not care less. The manager said there is no place they could buy it. Better choices available in Toronto"}
{"text":"Love this spot ! It's pretty pricey but the food and ambience is amazing. I love the outdoor patio. I would make reservations or get there early because it gets very packed very quickly. The drinks are also very good."}
{"text":"The location, dining area and ambience is 5 star.  Wasn't too thrilled with the service or quality of food though (lobster).  Tried the halibut (real nice).  Not bad for a lunch, unfortunately the whole dining experience did not cater well to my time constraints of a business lunch."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place that has great food, impeccable service and a sublime ambiance then your search stops here :)"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?

Their menu changes every month so I suggest you go for their seafood dishes!

As a FYI, there's TWO restaurants under the Chase name. One called oyster and bar and the other is just The Chase which is more of a fine dining restaurant on the second floor. Same entrance though!

I didn't stay long for dinner because I had a concert to attend, however I tried the scallop and duck main dish. I thought it was a nice portion of food. Scallops were done in the way I like my scallops. 

The decor to the restaurant is posh too. They have an outdoor patio and big windows to let in natural light. 

Last tip?!

Great place for special events like anniversaries or even birthdays. The decor is really nice. Make sure you call and put in a reservation because sometimes the restaurant is booked out for the night."}
{"text":"I had such a wonderful dinner here

Decor: the inside is stylish but \"homey\", very clean appearing and modern.  The theme is nautical.  The music is loud but I enjoyed the atmosphere.  A good mixture of dates and small groups, everyone looked like they were having a great time.

Food:
We started with a giant tray of oysters.  I don't typically order oysters at restaurant but I loved these.  The mignonette and hot sauce were delicious, the presentation was beautiful.  We tried a bunch of different types. 

The restaurant gave each of us a free smoked lobster bisque.  This was so creamy and the flavors were great.  I would order it alone.  

Then we ordered the Sunday special which is a clambake.  This was amazing!  I huge bowl of mussels, clams, a whole lobster, roasted garlic, potatoes all in a tasty broth.  It came with a loaf of focaccia bread that was perfect dipped in the broth and spreading the roasted garlic on.  We devoured this.  It is meant for 2 people, we split two of them between 5 of us (and had the oysters).  Highly recommend.  It looked like everyone else in the restaurant ordered the same thing.

For dessert I had the apple tart with ice cream.  This was good but I would have preferred if the tart was warm.  

The service was perfect, we were kept well taken care of. 

Overall a lovely restaurant to spend a special evening in. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE here!! so much better than Rodney's! (sorry) 
But it's true!! so much reasonable and yet you get more culinary quality than Rodney! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The Chase was the only Winterlicious restaurant I attended this year and I was ecstatic, I've heard great things about the chase so at a $35 price point I thought it was a steal considering an entree can range from $25-60 a plate.

We started off with around of oyster shooters for the table, it was fresh and light without an overly alcholicy aftertaste. It was a perfect way to start off a great meal.

I started off with the Salmon Tartar (Horseradish Crème Fraiche, Beet Relish, Crispy Capers). I loved everything about this dish, from the delicate salmon to the sweet beets and the salty capers. Everything was perfectly balanced and the lightly toasted bread was a great vessel without being overly crunchy.

The Lobster &amp; Tomato Bisque (Brandy &amp; Green Peppercorn Cream) was the other appetizer that was one of the other choices. The soup was creamy and full of flavour but I felt like it was more like a tomato bisque with chunks of lobster.

The Pan Seared Arctic Char (Potato Rosti, Braised Red Cabbage, Caramelized Apple, Chestnut) was hands down the favourite of the night. The star of the dish was the char skin, it was incredibly crispy and was cooked to perfection &amp; light.
The Braised Beef Short Rib (Stone Ground Grits, Wild Mushroom &amp; Charred Scallion Relish, Crispy Onions) was a great choice for meat eaters, super hearty and fulling. The dish as a whole was a little too heavy for me from the creamy grits to the meaty short rib all topped off with fried onions but nothing to cut the richness.

I'm always on the fence about ordering donuts from restaurants because I'm not a fan of cake donuts, so when our server mentioned it was a yeast donut I had nothing else on my mind, donut for dessert it was! Donuts (Cinnamon Apple Compote, Caramel, Calvados Cream).
My favourite dessert was the Caramelized Banana Sundae (Peanut butter Ice Cream and Warm Date Toffee) something about the deliciously sweet toffee &amp; caramelized banana with the contrast of the salty peanut butter ice cream was heavenly. Sweet, salty, hot and cold, everything in one dessert.

I'll definitely be back for their regular menu and will be a must for all 'licious events. I must say it was one of my favourite restaurants for the $35 price point."}
{"text":"I was recently at The Chase (5th floor) with my family.
When asked where I wanted to go for my 'special' birthday, I suggested this restaurant as I had taken someone  here a number of years ago and had had a good experience.  Alas, the times they have changed and this was seriously one of the very worst meals I've every had
anywhere and what makes it more egregious is that the service was the worst thing about
the meal!

  We arrived at around 8:30 on a Saturday night.  The restaurant was definitely NOT full.  My
son had made the reservation at least two weeks in advance and had asked to
be seated in the front or at least in the middle of the room.  We were seated
in a booth at the very BACK corner of the restaurant.  It was very cold in that corner and
we felt like we could have been dining at another place.  Our waiter dropped off
the menus and literally disappeared, period..After about 20 minutes we flagged down
the hostess who proceeded to take our order.....a very BAD beginning.  The 
sommelier was very pleasant and we ordered a couple of bottles of what turned out to
be a great Malbec wine.  From this point on everything went downhill.   Eventually, someone
brought 5 thin strips of bread with a dip to our table.  This was apparently the
'amuse bouche'.  It was tasty but tiny which is the operative word for the appetizers and
the mains.  If I were to describe our dining experience, I would have to
say it wasThe Emperor's New Clothes:  our appetizers were ALL very
small and our mains were all a two to three bite affair.  The plates were embarrassingly
empty and even the two orders of fries were far from fulsome!  This isn't the kind of
meal you can linger over savouring the lovely tastes.  It was over in minutes.
Needless to say we were very hungry by the time they brought the dessert menus (which
they had NO business bringing as my son had specifically asked for a variety of lovely
pasteries topped with an individualized Happy Birthday to be brought to the table as a
SURPRISE..candles and all).  Instead they came back asking if we were ready to order and my poor disappointed daughter-in-law was forced to a) spoil the surprise and b) say what it was that was pre-ordered!  What came might have been good had it not yet AGAIN been minuscule.  Moreover part of the desert was left in the kitchen and had to be brought
after the fact.   
When the bill came everyone was hungry and aggravated; but, to add insult to injury
(and trust me the bill was truly injurious)  a pasta lobster dish (where the lobster had been
substituted by 3 shrimps) was double charged: once for the original dish and once for
the substitution.    Since lobster is far more expensive than 3 shrimps this was the last straw.  Because it was my birthday, it was deemed tacky to dispute the bill as much as I would have wanted to.
In short, if you come to drink and sit around the bar or patio then it's a nice place to hang out.
If however, you're actualy coming with the expectation of a lovely meal, I would suggest you
go just about anywhere else...I know my family and I will!"}
{"text":"Very beautiful inside. Reminded me of Gold Coast's fig & olive restaurant with the clean decor. Beautiful people here on a Friday night. Waited awhile for a table though it didn't seem too packed but it was worth the wait for a romantic booth seating with views of floor to ceiling glass wine cellar. 

First off, whatever they put on top of their table bread was amazing! It was a focaccia bread topped with an apricot glaze marmalade. It was so good we finished the whole loaf!

The appetizer we chose was crab cakes on corn bread. Though it wasn't exactly what I was expecting the portion was big (there's a photo) and we enjoyed it. We split a fish dish & they brought it out split into two with the perfect presentation along with a generous portion of bland Brussels sprouts. 

Upstairs is the more expensive restaurant while downstairs is more affordable and casual. This was an ok experience. Super expensive with glasses of wine around $16 for 5oz. 

The people who work here are beautiful.... That's all. :)"}
{"text":"The 3 star rating is for the service and food. I made reservations for 8pm and wasn't seated until a good 40 minutes later. My date and I were asked to wait at the bar...we had at least 2 sipping drinks each before they seated us and there weren't any seats at the bar. Standing in heels with drinks for 40 mins...I was hoping the food would be outstanding. Looking around, the place is decorated nicely but a little too stuck up for my liking. The wait staff were professional but not warm. This isn't a place I'd go to for comfort, just for work-related meals. 

Now to the food... We asked if we could have muscles from the downstairs menu. They complied and we were happy. They weren't the best muscles I've had but were decent. Next time I'll just have them downstairs where it's less stuffy. The beef tartare and pearl platter were just OK, nothing outstanding. The best thing on their menu was the octopus. It's not a menu I remember much about...nothing stood out even after the $400 bill.

I don't understand what the hype is about. It's not great food. There's far better places to have a great meal if you're trying to impress. The only impressive quality of The Chase is the ambience and the suits! Go here once but head to Queen West if you're looking for taste!"}
{"text":"I stopped by The Chase Fish & Oyster with two girlfriends because the restaurant offered an Instagram promotion offering 3 free oysters to the first 500 followers. Now onto the food!

First came the complimentary oysters, which were absolutely delicious! I can't remembered which variety we picked but it was plump and sweet. The accompaniments were also excellent, especially the hot sauce. 

Oyster po'boy sliders ($11 for 2) - garlic scape tartar sauce
These were tiny but packed a lot of flavours! I wanted 3 more for myself, but wished that they were slightly bigger. Each order  came with two sliders, but we were able to add a third one for an extra $4. 

Steamed mussels ($18)- garlic, white wine, laurelhouse made focaccia and apple butter
I think all the dishes are meant to be shared, but instead we decided ordered our own dishes as our \"mains\". That idea didn't work too well as the dishes turned out to be rather small. I had the mussels, and I was probably the only one that was full, party because it came with bread. The mussels were tasty, and I devoured the whole roasted garlic. 

Pan roasted scallop ($22) - toasted brioche, roasted foie gras, smoked duck, apple lemon relish.
My friend was extremely disappointed that her dish only contained one sole scallop. Even though it was cooked beautifully, the portion was alarmingly small, which was a bit of a let down. 

Baked clams ($15) - braised lamb neck, tomato jam, brioche crumb
Sandy described her clams as... \"different\". I'm not sure, in this case, that \"different\" was a good thing. 

Fried apple pie ($9) - cinnamon stewed northern spy apples, vanilla calvados custard & almond  praline ice cream
We ordered two desserts because my friends weren't full. Our first choice- an apple pie- was an absolute delight! The crust was to die for and I would say that this dessert was the best part of our entire meal!

Key Lime Cake ($11) - key lime curd, angel food cake, coconut cream & toasted marshmallow icing
Even though the cake looked appealing, it did not live up to the apple pie. I thought that there was way too much cream and on the whole, it reminded me of any generic fruit cake that you can get at a Chinese bakery. 

Our meal was full of ups and downs. While the oysters and the apple pie were both outstanding, but some of the other dishes were pricey and failed to satisfy.  I might consider coming back for apps and/or dessert, but I'd probably eat a hot dog first next time."}
{"text":"The food objectively is below average but the prices are substantially above average.

Ordered two martinis to find out that they were $29 each. 

Ordered the octopus. It was over cooked and dry. 

Also ordered the avocado stuffed with shrimp but there was barely any shrimp to be found, but large globs of mayonnaise and I believe the price was $25.

Ended up waiting 45mins for our mains but when the cod came it was very cold....and the $58 pan roast came with 3 mussels, two small pieces of cold fish and a very tiny lobster tail....

This place has a nice businessy vibe and while the service was slow the servers were nice and professional.

If you have an expense account and price is not an issue, go to a restaurant that actually serves good food. There are plenty of options downtown."}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious - food was mediocre. The croquette  and shrimp Po boy were both tasty but nothing to remember or rave about. The strawberry shortcake for dessert was not the greatest, the sorbet that topped it was overly sour. Service was good though, it was very hot on the patio so they moved us inside once a table freed up."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing!  Our large party went with no expectations and came out beyond thrilled!  Incredible ambiance (5th floor dining), phenomenal food and fabulous service!

Serving and pleasing a table of 11 is no easy task but The Chase accomplished it with 100% success.

This is a must venue for anyone wanting to dine in style and experience a delicious meal and wonderful view at the same time.  We did not eat on the patio but I would love to the next time I go to The Chase.

Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Four hours and a mediocre dinner later, I am very unsatisfied. 

No joke, our dinner here lasted FOUR HOURS. This is never acceptable, but when your guests are a group of very jetlagged workholics, this is especially not okay. 

The food was also meh. I ordered the Cod, which was drowned in a back goo that I'm guessing is squid ink. Maybe I'd missed the description on the menu, but I certainly did not expect my fish to be hidden under a blanket of nasty. 

They do desserts really well though...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me by booking a reservation to The Chase and I was beyond delighted. I had heard about this place for quite sometime and with all the hype, it was totally worth it. The building and interior is beautifully decorated to reflect a casual upscale environment. Service was also top notch and attentive.

We ordered a dozen oysters to share as a starter - all very fresh from different regions. We both decided to share two mains - the Lobster Hot Pot and the Fried Chicken. Both were delicious in their own ways. The lobster hot pot was amazing - the broth had a great depth of seafood flavour without being overly salty; if I could, I would have finished the broth off only if I had some bread. The seafood in the hot pot was great as well although I found the lobster to be just slightly overcooked. The scallops, clams, and mussels were cooked to perfection and all very fresh. The fried chicken had the right  amount of crunch and was very moist. The coleslaw was amazing - every bite there were bits of provolone cheese and it was a very different take from what you would expect from a normal coleslaw. 

Overall, great food and great service. Although the place is a bit pricey, I would still recommend anyone to go try The Chase Fish and Oyster if you feel like splurging. I will definitely be going back in the future."}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto, a good friend who works downtown recommended Chase for dinner....claiming it was one of his Top 5 places. Unfortunately, it was a bust .... did not live up to the hype. No imagination with the dinner selections and very limited. Not a \"real\" seafood restaurant...but then again, I am comparing Chase to other east coast/west coast seafood establishments I have dined at.

My biggest gripe was the apathetic, slow and unenthusiastic service.  It was Friday night around 7pm...and it was not crowded. I remarked how there seemed to be more staff than customers. Getting water, bread or any attention was painfully slow....had to ask 2 other servers before our table's server arrived.

Since there was no list of oysters being offered that evening, we had to ask our server. He looked bored in having to list and comment on the 8 - 10 types available. When asked for his recommendation, he replied \"they are all good\".

Again, nothing special about the food and a bit overpriced (but I was expecting higher prices in downtown Toronto).

Anyway, real seafood lovers should avoid Chase. There are many many other places to dine at in T.O."}
{"text":"The Chase entrance is located in a small alley On Temperance st. Between Young and Bay st. 
Went there with friends on the recommendation of other friends. 
We had a reservation so we were seated immediately. It was indoors, they had a lovely outdoors as well.
We were served water to start with. Then we ordered freshly cut salad, roasted eggplants, Fish 'n chips, and they were able to provide a steak for one of our group from their restaurant upstairs ( I assume a different chef) and almost forgot to mention the Cod taco.
The food was delicious and well cooked. 
The seats were comfortable, the place was clean and the waiters were great and smiley.
The only downside for the place is a very loud music ( it might be a good thing for others!).
Anyway, I recommend the place for romantic evenings, groups as well as family gatherings. 
Enjoy."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and was excited to go. I left disappointed.

 The good things. The service was amazing. The laneway to walk to the door made it feel like you were going someplace special. The high ceilings and decor. Awesome. When you walk in you see the kitchen, that was do neat. And you can watch them shuck oysters. I liked the music that played. The yonge street platter was good but how hard is it to mess up fresh raw food?

Bad things.  Note. I really wanted to love this restaurant.  I love seafood and love finding new places to go. The music was way too loud. You had to shout to have a conversation with the person sitting next to you. 
 The food in all honesty was just okay. Had the smelt app and octopus meh. It was okay. For the price 15 and 28. I would expect something 'good'. The octopus strangely was both spicy and bland at the same time.  Even if it was 5 dollars. I wouldn't get it again. We also had muscles. They were also just okay. The halibut was just okay. The steak was just okay.. The yonge street platter was good. Loved the oysters and CLS. The sauces were good but not good enough for another visit I'm afraid. Prices were high portions small. If they tasted good it would not matter.

Also we were charged a gratuity 18% and a gratuity tax. Not sure what a gratuity tax is."}
{"text":"Summerlicious lunch. Nice decor and vibe. Great for taste menus like summerlicious, but probably wouldn't have come for the regular menu."}
