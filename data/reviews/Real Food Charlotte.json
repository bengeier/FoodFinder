{"text":"I've only been once, but it was delicious.  I had the mamma's mushrooms minus the pita.  The mushrooms were seasoned perfectly, I got a side of hummus and that was wonderful, too.  The plate also came with a side salad - mixed greens, topped with sprouts and nut clusters.....YUM!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  So nice to be able to pick up something quick that's actually healthy. Staff is so nice. Great New Orleans music playing when I stopped by. Fresh & healthy. I also had the Ginger/Lemonade, very refreshing. Be careful though because it has an intense fresh Ginger punch. I'll be a regular!"}
{"text":"Coming from California, I searched for something besides an artery-hardening burger or something fried with pecans on it. Real Food Charlotte was a savior.  I had three meals here in two days (one was to go).   Mama's Mushroom pocket - Tasty, marinated mushrooms wrapped in a thick-hearty pita poke that refuses to fall apart. Excellent.  Cous Cous Salad (Daily special) - Cous Cous with salad, grapes were a nice touch.  The fruit smoothies were a bit watered down, but I did like the Popeye punch with spinach and pineapple. Refreshing.  All in all the only game in town when you want something healthy.I just wished they would extend their hours to dinner.  Will be back when I come back into town."}
{"text":"Oh man. I am so stoked.  This place is tiiiiny, adjoins a yoga studio, and has some really, really good food coming out of it. They brew local coffee, cheaply, and have some tasty vegan/raw desserts, but the small container of couscous (pine nuts galore, delicate flavors of thyme and rosemary, amazing richness, topped by some micro greens and two sliced cherry 'maters) I just inhaled tells me something special is happening here.  The menu is dependent on whatever local stuff they source each morning and changes accordingly. \"Mains\" seem to come in at about $8 and are not huge, but not tiny, in portion size. Tibetan flags hang down from the super-high ceiling. Very vertically airy, but they needed more floor space (and will need even more, I predict, once word gets around) so a lot of the seating is outside on the \"porch\". Whether this is how it was at Tea Rex, I'll never know, cos I never got to go there.   I agree with Jonathan-- friendliest staff EVAR. Randy used to work at the formerly awesome Talley's and, on top of being a sweetheart, obviously knows what he's doing with food.  Open every day, I believe, 6am-3pm."}
