{"text":"Best shish taouk plate in the West Island.    They lovingly separate the hot from the cold so you don't receive a tepid mess.  Chicken is plentiful, rice and spicy garlic potatoes are surprisingly delicious, and the salad...  oh that salad dressing is out of this world.   Delivery is fast and friendly, and the telephone ordering always painless.   Try it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's good quality, inexpensive and the guys are super super nice. It's a good quality lunch/dinner. Highly recommend the chicken (though everything is good)."}
{"text":"I been going to this place for two years. Huge potion. I think two years ago their plate was 10 dollars now it's about 13. Still my favourite shawrwma place in Montreal"}
{"text":"Lebanese Restaurant - Halal .  I've been going here for a couple of years.  It's my teenage daughter's favourite place to go for a Shish-Taouk. Everything is really fresh. There's everything from Falafels, Shawarma, Kafta etc. They even have a Poutine taouk - which i'm told is very popular.  There is nothing over $12 for a plate and $5.75 for a sandwich on the menu. They also cater.  Worth it."}
