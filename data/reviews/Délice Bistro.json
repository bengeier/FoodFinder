{"text":"Delicious Crepes! Delice has the feel and menu for an authentic bistro. This place will be a great Breakfast or Lunch spot. I appreciate any place that has fresh juices! Mill Ave is lucky to host this business."}
{"text":"For some reason, I had high hopes for this place. What a bloody joke. The only \"European\" characteristic that they got right is the high volume if people smoking on the patio next to the open door-leading to the kitchen. The lack of manners/basic customer service etiquette should have tipped me off.  Their prices would not be unreasonable if the quality were there. It seems that not a single restaurant or cafe in Phoenix can give you something other than a paper cup, which is silly and detracts from the experience and ambiance. They are also depressingly understaffed. I watched this poor barista pump out MAYBE 5 drinks in the half hour that I was here. The pre-made food was actually best in this case. I had the chocolate mousse cake, which was pretty average for something like that.  My fiance was served cold crepes, that were supposed to have butter on them. The butter somehow lost it's way from the kitchen to our table. This was honestly the worst crepe I have ever had. Bland, chunky, and undercooked.  There did not seem to be a single person over the age of 19 working there. This is not working-You guys need an adult."}
{"text":"So glad to have this new little gem on mill ave. We need more local places like this!   Essence is always my go-to for croissants. But Essence is also closed on Sundays so Delice is a great addition to the area. Chocolate was delicious as was the croissant. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place  Fantastic fresh food, pastries, and yummy drinks. Great service too...Borka is friendly, amazing, and she makes the best suggestions. You should definitely stop in for coffee or lunch if you haven't yet"}
{"text":"This is by far the best French bistro in phx!!! The panini's and crepes are just perfect. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a great meal with a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I'm giving them three stars because of three things; location, service, and the atmosphere of the restaurant. I edited my review because of two main issues. The food it not good like before. The coffee been a big problem. They should find special person to make coffee properly. Th food sometimes is cold, the crapes are the not good like before. Sorry guys"}
{"text":"I went in with a friend around 10am on a Sunday morning.  To my surprise,  the whole place was empty.  There were three girls stood behind the counter but nobody greeted us. We ordered the lattes and a couple of croissants.  The lattes were bland but the croissants were pretty good.  I wanted to order the fruit tart to take home but they looked soggy. My guess is the tarts are more than a couple of days old. The service was slow and the girls did not smile the whole time."}
{"text":"Very nice place ! Great omelets and yes they do real organic juices ! Service is great ! Charming place ! Totally recommended."}
{"text":"We ordered a quiche and crepes. The order took longer than expected.  We received the wrong type of quiche, not what we ordered.  The food was okay but the quiche was more bread than fillIng.  Both bathrooms had problems.  Was excited to try it but won't return."}
{"text":"I work right across the street from this cute little restaurant. I've wanted so badly to like coming here, as it is so conveniently located, but, unfortunately, time after time I've been disappointed by the service and inability to keep items in stock.   At times, I've ordered an iced latte only to find a weird oily syrup at the bottom of the drink - like the drink was not mixed together well.   The last 2 times I've gone in to get quick coffee or tea, they have been out of the items I wanted. First with the tropical iced tea, and second with almond milk to add to my coffee. The lady preparing my coffee didn't even know they were out of almond milk before letting me order and pay more to have almond milk instead of cream, which they offer for free. I'm allergic to dairy, so that's why I'm willing to pay more for the alternative milk.   I've been in so often, and witnessed so many failures at running this business, their go-to to correct their mistakes is to offer a free pastry. So, at least there's that, but don't say I didn't tell you when you run into poor service and inability to maintain stock at this quaint little restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my third visit and unfortunately will be my last.   Try to avoid this place. If you can't, just order a baked good from the case. Their hot food items and coffee are not great.  Food: ordered the avocado, spinach and egg breakfast sandwich on ciabatta bread. The sandwich came out on focaccia and was over buttered and tasted chemicals. The egg was an egg white, which is fine but this was not specified in the menu. The spinach was stringy and oily. There were two thin slices of avocado.  Drop coffee is self-serve. It tasted and smelled burned.  Atmosphere: The restaurant is almost always empty or with one or two other people. The ordering counter flow is confusing and their menu is on two TV screens. The place can be really cute, but it seems like they don't pay attention to details. There was trash and dust on tables, cleaning supplies in corners, nails on the walls where artwork used to hang.  Service: there were a lot of people working in the kitchen, but only one guy working at the counter, which would make any place run slowly. Parking validation seems to be really difficult for them to do for their patrons."}
{"text":"What a disappointing experience! We (party of 4) came to Delice because we are always looking for a good place for breakfast/brunch on Mill and thought this place would fit the bill. Here's a rundown:  1. The people working at Delice are not particularly friendly or helpful. They are not familiar with the menu and anytime we asked a question, they had to go ask someone for the answer. 2. We came in for breakfast but could only get lunch since breakfast isn't served after 11:00. Ok, we'll adjust. 3. They were out of a few things we asked about on the menu. 4. The Muesli is served cold and it took forever for them to bring a spoon, in order to actually eat it. 5. I asked what kind of flavored iced tea they had and she told me they had black or green tea. Right after ordering, I noticed the tea menu that listed 5 or 6 different kinds of tea (some of them flavored) but she didn't offer to change my order. 6. Two of us ordered the Prime Rib Au Jus under \"Hot Sandwiches\" and we were specifically told about the delicious Au Jus that came on the side. The sandwiches were served cold and there was Au Jus on only one plate. They did take them back and warm the Prime Rib and toast the baguette.  7. They brought out hot tea instead of iced tea. 8.  The place needs some TLC, cleaning and attention to detail. The menu is taped upside down on the window for passers-by to read. The windows, in the restaurant, are filthy. There were only four tables occupied while we were there but many of the other tables were dirty and full of dishes the entire time we were there. Stuff/food all over the floors. Something splattered all over the wall in the bathroom. Stacks of boxes toward the back of the restaurant. 9. The owners were there during our dining experience and it seems like they have no interest in making sure things are running properly and they certainly have no attention to detail.  Overall, we were very disappointed and are unlikely to return. This place has a lot of potential but if they don't fix things immediately, they will not be open in a year."}
{"text":"Such a cute little bakery found in the center of Downtown Tempe and the food is really great. Between the Apple Turnover , Banana  Foster French Toast and Spinach and Mushroom Omelette we could not decide which we liked best, exceptional food. However, their service was less then desirable and cause to think twice before going back. The person that took our order was less then pleasurable and insisted that we pay more for items then what was posted on their electronic menu boards (\"they hadn't been updated\") and part of our order never made it to the kitchen and we had to inquire to when it would be ready after everyone else was finished.   I just wish that the service met the same standards of the food."}
{"text":"The opening of Delice had been much anticipated as I passed by the space during my daily pilgrimage to Starbucks over the past several months.  It was clear that much care and concern was being taken with the construction and interior.  While not always an indication that the same level of deliberation would be given to the food, in the case of Delice, it is clear that the \"slow food\" they espouse on their website really means that every aspect of the dish - flavor, texture, temperature, ingredients, presentation - are all taken into account when the final product is delivered on a plate.  What put my most recent experience over the moon was the Cafe Mocha.  \"Cafe Mocha\" or \"Mocha Latte\" usually means \"syrup- or powder-based monstrosity\" and should really be called, \"Hot Disappointment.\"    There is no disappointment to be found in Delice's Cafe Mocha.  You know that seen in the movie \"Chocolat\" where the town's mayor is discovered Easter morning passed out amongst the all chocolate after a one-man cocoa orgy?  Yeah...it's like that.  Delice's owner, Monsieur Arfan, was so pleased to hear how much we enjoyed the mocha that he brought us back behind the counter where the coffee is made and showed us the undulating device that keeps the real Belgian chocolate constantly in motion and at the perfect temperature.  It was like looking into a vat of love.  I could, and likely will, sit in the simple but elegant bistro for hours as the sun crosses the sky and streams in through the many windows.  The dark wood of the tables and chairs grounds the airy space while the din of preparations hum behind the counter.  The patio is lined with live flowers.  One could find refuge from the rays in one of two cabanas that beckon friends to sit, mingle, enjoy.  Delice is truly a gem.  The offerings are unparalleled in the Phoenix area (this girl knows where to find French pastry ... see previous reviews).  The croissants, pain au chocolat, quiche, omelets, salads, espresso, and scones are all just the beginning.  Lovers of both sweet and savory will find a happy place at Delice.   I know I have."}
{"text":"They carry a large variety of desserts and meals. Absolutely love the nutella with vanilla ice cream Crêpe. Parking on mill is always terrible, but there's a parking structure only 3 minutes away. The seating within the restaurant is ample, they have cute decorations inside and the patio is a lovely place to sit when it's warm outside. Their staff is extremely helpful and kind. Overall it's a very charming place that is perfect for a lunch date."}
{"text":"The prices were good, but the tables were none too clean and the food was mediocre at best. The ice machine didn't work (for drinks), and the staff was unable to validate our parking ticket \"today,\" which cost us an extra $4.00."}
{"text":"First time I came here, I was standing outside looking at the menu trying to see what sounded good. Within that time, 3 people came out (at different times; they weren't together) and they each said the same thing: \"Everything here is delicious, just try it.\" The last person that said it, I jokingly asked if she was being paid to say so. She obviously said no but told me her experiences here and assured me I wouldn't regret it.  Well, she was right, they all were! I've been here more than a few times and have yet to be disappointed. I work in the area so it's convenient for me to stop in for a quick snack (like the spinach & ricotta croissant; delicious), for lunch or for something sweet. Their panini and side salads are very good, try the fig jam and goat cheese for something a little different. They've got crepes, croissants, big cookies and more. I haven't tried their pasta yet but I'm sure it's great. If you see yourself coming back, join their rewards club (they just need your phone #) for free items. There is a decent amount of seating inside and on the patio as well. Just try it, I'm sure you'll like it."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars for their desserts. However their service sucks..they don't believe service with a smile or apologize for spilling customers drinks"}
{"text":"I was expecting something more European style, the place feels empty for a French cafe, the pastries were good, I ordered a almond croissant and a cinnamon roll, the were good, no too sweet, for some reason the texture felt like the same dough for both pastries, but very pleasant after taste. As for coffee, the worst I've ever had, I ordered a simple latte, and I got a some sort of cappuccino, no coffee flavor at all, no latte art, just milk."}
{"text":"I was initially excited to try this place based upon pictures and the menu but after stopping in for dessert I probably won't return or it has at least moved down on my list.   We came in on a week night and split two desserts. One was a moist coconut vanilla type cake and the other was a lemon tart. The desserts were ok, but nothing special that you couldn't find elsewhere at a standard bakery. The staff was friendly but the kitchen could have been more well kept. They had also ran out of clean silver ware so we had to use plastic forks and knives.   It's not that it was bad, it's just nothing above average and so I would rather visit other bakeries that have more and better options."}
{"text":"Ordered a Veggie Panini to-go. The Panini was sitting on the counter for what seemed like a long time before I had to go back and ask them to check if it is ready. Like others have said, bad customer service. What was worse, my panini was cut into four pieces and the four pieces were just thrown into the box. No arrangement what-so-ever. It wasn't like a panini, it was like two crisp pieces of bread thrown in the box. The romaine salad seemed stale."}
{"text":"Went to Delice today with a couple of my boys, awesome staff, awesome owners, awesome delicious European food. Will definitely be going back there"}
{"text":"Try the s'mores crepe.  Very sweet and gooey.  Eat it fast as the marshmallows stick to the plate.  The turkey and swiss crepe was also good but could have been heated more thoroughly.  If you're looking for some \"stick to your ribs\" kind of food, try the lasagna.  Coconut cake was the bomb - light & fluffy icing with moist cake.  Friendly service at the counter.  Restaurant environment was nice except for music that seemed a little loud for the bistro setting."}
{"text":"Awesome employees, girls here are amazing, amazing to talk with, great customer service, and Rose is an amazing person, one reason I like coming back to this coffee shop,(she is so real) thanks for al you do...   5 stars for amazing employees, really do an amazing job...."}
{"text":"Tried this place again. They finally are getting their shit together. Food is good, and made well. The staff is friendly as well."}
{"text":"We drove out of our way from Chandler to get crepes. The crepes looked pretty but were cold along with the plates/silverware. We eventually figured out they were cold because they were making them outside in 43 degree weather and bringing them into the restaurant on ice cold plates. They said they were out of lids for me to take my hot tea to go which was a little annoying. When my husband went to get our parking garage ticket validated, they said they were out of validation tickets and we were essentially out of luck. It cost us $6 to park in the garage for less than an hour! My husband told them the crepes were cold and he was pretty much told it was too bad. A lady in the restaurant told the worker she fell and asked for the owners name, the worker didnt know the owners name and had to ask a co-worker. This tells you how often the owner frequents the shop! The second worker said \"oh I'm sorry\" with little  empathy when she told her she wanted the owners name because she fell. She never asked if she was ok or if she needed anything and watched the lady walk out the door. Two workers went to look at where she said she had fallen, their response was \"what was she doing over here\", not oh gosh let's fix it so it doesn't happen to anyone else. The restaurant  staff appeared to either not be trained in how to handle customer complaints or just didn't care! It ruined our relaxing evening and we will not be back! We also caution you not to go either!"}
{"text":"My daughter recommended Delice and we decided to grab a bite to eat after wandering through Tempe's Art Festival. I'd like to assume that the B team was onboard since the young woman taking our order seemed distracted and argued with me over whether or not they served a brie sandwich listed on their menu. The sausage and egg crepe my boyfriend ordered wasn't available so he went for the spinach, chicken and cheese crepe which was quite good.  My daughter's brie sandwich was short on brie but the bread was great. I'd ordered the fig jam, goat cheese, walnut, and caramelized onion panini which sounds awesome, right? Unfortunately huge disappointment! The onions monopolized the flavor and made up 90% of the panini. Would have liked a little more goat cheese and walnuts. Definitely sounded better as a menu item.   We sat outside on the patio and were impressed with the super industrious and efficient young man creating crepe after crepe. I'm a huge Nutella  fan so had to try the Nutella crepe which was pretty good. Would recommend both the savory and sweet crepes.   I'd like to visit again when it's not a festival weekend and the staff might be a little more engaged and welcoming."}
{"text":"this place is perfect. it's not too upscale not too casual- it's a great \"go to\" spot or everyday place to grab coffee & a pastry. The crepes are authentic and mouth watering :)  I'm so glad Tempe has a hot spot like this for me to enjoy while I'm in school. Thank you delice for making me feel so welcomed! :)"}
{"text":"I been there few times in the last few weeks, I can say that this place is different , the food is very good , and better is the chocolate and the cookies. The service is little bit slow , but I guess it is expected at a newly open place"}
{"text":"Desserts are excellent. Savory foods are underwhelming.  Service is slow/bad."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a french inspired restaurant for so long and alas, Delice Bistro opened in such a convenient area--right on Mill Ave! The servers were beyond welcoming, the decor of the place was phenomenal (beautiful French detail!), and of course, the food was AMAZING! I've been there numerous times already and ordered the smores crepe, the mac and cheese, the rosemary chicken panini, the salmon quiche, quinoa tabouli and their Nutella machiatto. They were all were delicious but my absolute favorite so far is the almond croissant! I can tell all their pastries and desserts are freshly made. Overall, I'm extremely impressed with Delice and I will definitely be one of their regulars :)"}
{"text":"I have never tried anything on this menu I didn't like! the mac n cheese is my favorite. Rich cheese and delicious truffle oil. for dessert-the chocolate croissant is to die for!!! this place makes me feel like I'm in upper Manhattan or Michigan Avenue and even Paris! this place is a must go!!"}
{"text":"Delice Bistro brings something totally new to the Tempe area. The freshly baked bread and pastries are to die for. It's so hard to find authentic European delicacies in Arizona, but this place exceeded all my expectations. You have to try the Nutella French toast for breakfast or the paninis for lunch. And if you want coffee, the Nutella macchiato is a must!"}
{"text":"Uptight! It's clean and tidy but makes you feel suffocated. No one behind the counter knows how to smile and none of them know anything about valuable customer service, their own menu or their computer. The coffee is terrible and the food is bland, tiny and overpriced. If you want a breakfast crepe, they will refuse to make it until 10am (even if the place is dead and its 9:30). Also, the place is so quiet no music at all, but I'm more than sure that any music wouldn't help. Save your hard earned money! This place is so not worth it."}
{"text":"Delice is amazing!! Borka is amazing. She is always friendly and knows her stuff! The food is amazing too!! I love Delice!!!! Everyone should go there!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Spinach salad with grilled chicken.  It came with 2 pieces of bread, sliced green apples, chopped tomatoes, Gorgonzola cheese, walnuts, and a balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  The chicken was very tender and tasty.  The walnuts and cheese were chopped into very small pieces.  They looked liked bread crumbs.  Would have preferred larger, chunkier pieces.  Overall, the the salad was good.  The apples were a nice touch.  The place is bright and cheery but was a little hard to find since it's not easily visible from Mill Ave.  It's around the corner from a sports bar.  Saw delicious looking pastries but did not buy."}
{"text":"If I could give less than a star, I would. My daughter got a chocolate raspberry cupcake and found out it had black  fuzzy MOLD on the raspberry. I brought it up to one of the employees, she said nothing was wrong with cupcake. Then I went to the second employee and she said it was disgusting. She then called the manager out to deal with me. This manager guy WAS NOT happy at alI when he approached me. The first thing he said that all the cupcakes in the store were freshly  baked YESTERDAY and no way it had any MOLD on it. I pointed out some black and fuzzy thing on the raspberry to him and with the unpleasant face, he offered me for another one. I said \" no, thx\".                                                                 I hope they know BLACK MOLD could be deadly"}
{"text":"Food is good, but the amount of time needed to process your order and have it out to you within reasonable waiting time is far beyond. Waited 30 min for a chicken sandwich with a side of lettuce (salad). This isn't the first time this had occurred either. Coworkers of mine had the same exact issue with the same exact order."}
{"text":"With one exception, this place has the worst customer service of any restaurant that I've been to in downtown Tempe. I usually buy only baguettes here. But the last 5 times out of 6 visits, I walked out with nothing. Why? They were out of baguettes. They used to have a basket of baguettes near the register, then they went to a smaller jar, and now nothing. I've had to ask for a baguette at the counter. But lately, their response is,\" We are out of baguettes.\" When I ask why, they say they make everything from scratch and don't have enough to sell--they need them for sandwiches. They don't act or say they are sorry, just a dismissive, \"we don't have any.\" It's as if they feel they are doing me a favor by making the bread.   A bit of history with this place: I was happy to read about Delice in the New Times about a year ago I think. I will eat a whole baguette as a meal. It is the only place in downtown Tempe that has (had?) fresh baguettes. They aren't the best baguettes I've ever had, but as mentioned, options are limited in Tempe. Last year, after about my 4th visit, I decided to try a salad along with my usual baguette. It was a mixed-greens salad with a mustard-based dressing in a small container. When I tried to pour the dressing onto the salad, it stayed stuck in the container. It was as thick as mustard straight from the jar. It tasted like it too. I took it back and showed the staff. I was told the dressing was too cold and that was why it was so thick. I got a refund. I can get a bigger, better salad for the same price down the street at Sack's.  So I stayed with my usual order of just a baguette. I am at ASU 5-7 days a week. I usually walk over around lunch time to get a baguette. But it has been hit and miss about getting one. Lately, mostly a miss. I hate it when I take the time to walk to a vendor and find that the sole item I want is not available.   This last Friday was the last miss. I asked for a baguette and was told there weren't any. I asked to talk to the manager and it turned out he was the person \"helping\" me at the counter. I ran through my spiel about being irked when I've made multiple trips there only to be told they are out of baguettes. He was dismissive about my complaint and suggested I call ahead to see if there is bread. I don't own a phone so that doesn't work.  I walked out, but I did get a cheerful, \"Have a good day\" ringing in my ears as I left the place empty handed. I guess it's time to start baking my own bread again. I don't see any reason to waste time going there when it is a crap shoot trying to buy a loaf of bread.  I mentioned at the beginning that there is one exception to the bad customer service at this place. The exception is a dark-haired girl who is sometimes at the counter. When she sees me walk in, she already knows I want a baguette and is quick with the service. For some reason or coincidence, they have never been out of baguettes when she has been working. This place needs more people like her and less people who feel they are doing us a favor by being open."}
{"text":"I am updating Delice to a 4 star rating now that they have been up and running for a while.  Food is fantastic and the service is hit and miss still, but overall remarkable improvement!  They are adding new dinner items now and they are fantastic."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch this morning. The food was fine, but the service was not. One of us received our meal, but it was another 20 to 30 minutes before the other received her breakfast. I finally had to go up to the counter and ask about it. When it finally came, no one was the least bit apologetic; in fact, they almost seemed angry that we had asked (politely, I might add) about it. I regret having tipped at the counter when I ordered, and frankly, having come here at all."}
{"text":"Don't be left completely unsatisfied. We have had delice delivered several times, and it was great. After tonight, we will never go back. The grilled cheese panini was burnt & had barely anything on it. I had to put my own home ingredients to make it an actual grilled cheese. The Rosemary chicken was literally dry pieces of chicken on hard bread. The white peppermint mocha is basically flavored milk. Extremely disappointed & never again...epically at that price point. We should have just gotten Sprouts sandwiches, we would have been way better off."}
{"text":"The grilled vegetable pannini was a little bit too crunchy to bite, but their coffee was fresh n smooth. I don't usually have a second cup of coffee but I even refilled my coffee - it was that flavorful."}
{"text":"Their desserts are great, but the salmon quiche is AMAZING. I was reluctant to try it but I was so glad I did. It has a great amount of salmon and does not taste fishy at all. It is absolutely scrumptious. It comes with a small salad, but I am not in love with that at all. Definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Exceptionally slow service. This is now the second time that our crepes have taken over 25 mins to get out. The first time we were one of 3 people at the restaurant. This time though, I even saw the crepes being pulled out of a drawer. If you aren't making the crepes fresh, then why does it take so long? Adding chocolate and marshmallows isn't that time consuming."}
{"text":"Not good at all for sandwiches and salads. Really fatty food. The pastries are nice but that's pretty much it. Won't be back. They need some healthier options on the menu."}
{"text":"First time in today and first impression was wow how absorbable is this place! The bakery looked delicious however I I ordered a panini and tomato basil soup for lunch. It was pretty good the first few bites until I started realizing how much salt was in both of the items and starting feeling a bit uncomfortable. I wouldn't come back to pay $10-15 for a lunch that wasn't delicious. Perhaps I'll pay another visit for coffee or pastries before cutting this place off."}
{"text":"Most authentic and delicious french menu in the West Coast. The crepes are phenomenal, the baguette is freshly made and tastes like it was baked in Paris not to mention their fresh juices! I definitely recommend this bistro to anyone that appreciates great tasting food."}
{"text":"This is a nice bistro very near ASU. It was very clean and the staff was very friendly. I only tried the raspberry Danish, which was excellent and I got a chocolate Croissant for my son. The raspberry danish was very fresh and perfectly flaky. I'm not one for croissants usually, but I snuck a taste of the chocolate croissant and it is light, flaky and delicious! Quite a few pastries to choose from, so I'll definitely have to go back to try more. There is ample spacious indoor seating and outdoor seating where you can keep an eye on the hustle and bustle of Mill Ave. I will definitely be back to have lunch. ***I ended up being able to eat the chocolate  croissant and the rest was as good as the first bite. Delicioso!"}
{"text":"First let me start out by saying that the bread here is phenomenal. I ordered a salmon tartine cold sandwich, by recommendation. The atmosphere is exactly as they describe, French music, the patio to people watch, and being right on mill, can't go wrong with sitting outside in the beautiful arizona winter weather. I definitely recommend the bread while sitting down outside to study! Had this place not been 40 minutes away from my home; I would come here much more frequently to study. Enjoy and take in this bistro. Well worth my time."}
{"text":"Great and fresh!!! Delicious French toast and quiche. We were initially disappointed since the restaurant we wanted to go to was full so we accidentally  found this restaurant. When in town we will be back! Great croissants especially the almond."}
{"text":"I had the Smoked Salmon Tartines on Baguette bread. There's butter on the bread, salmon with red onion and capers. It comes with a small side salad and mustard-based dressing. It was fresh and tasted excellent! I would have given 5 stars if the portions were a bit bigger but I guess I'll have to add desert next time. ;-) Looking forward to trying more items from their menu in the future."}
{"text":"My husband and I drove the way to tempe from north scottsdale because we wanted to try this place.  The decor is beautiful! Reminded me of the many places we visited in Paris. I remember thinking, \"i hope the food is good cause I can definitely see myself coming back\".  We both ordered the cheese/mushroom/egg crepe and it was perfectly made. My husband had the OJ and it tasted fresh. The iced green tea was great!  Service was friendly and quick.  We'll be back. Next time I would get the Napoleon. I've been thinking about them since I came home."}
{"text":"It looked gorgeous from the outside as well as the outside! The food was very good as well. My boyfriend and I both got crepes for lunch and they were excellently sized! I know there have been complaints on here about service but we had no problems and enjoyed our servers! We also both got a Nutella Macchiatos and they were delicious! I loved my experience here! The atmosphere was very welcoming!"}
{"text":"Such a great experience here! I was traveling on business and I received the suggestion of checking it out. It didn't disappointment!  The setting: Fashioned like a cute little bistro or cafe you'd possibly see somewhere in Europe, complete with indoor or outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is plenty, with the option of sitting at some tables that are covered too in order to escape some of the heat. The food: I had the Grilled Chicken Panini and it was more than plenty and DELICIOUS! Sometimes I have a weird thing about chicken, but it was fantastic all white meat. It was served with a side salad, and though I don't normally step out of my comfort zone with dressings, whatever they had on it was also delicious! The pastries: Like whoa! I had an eclair (fantastic!), though everything was completely drool-worthy and I would have happily taste-tested everything in the place! All their pastries and chocolates are made on location, which gives it even more of a charming effect. Location: Located, conveniently, across the street from where I work, but even more importantly, just off the main drag of Mill Street.  Staff: The staff was extremely delightful and even let me \"pick\" my own eclair. They were very helpful, even when I forgot to get my receipt for expenses!  Overall, great experience and food. I definitely suggest stopping in here if you're in the Tempe, AZ area!"}
{"text":"Was here a couple times with a friend this week while visiting Tempe.  It's a very cute place, and right off the beaten path of Mill Ave.  Food was reasonably priced and very good as was the service.  Highly recommend the eggs benedict with avocado on a croissant....to die for!  Not sure why everyone is so judgemental with the bad reviews, every good restaurant will have its occasional hiccups.  We came at off-peak times so not sure how things would have changed if it was super busy but we will be back!!"}
{"text":"I hate this place. Mainly because every time I go to France I gain 10 pounds, and now I have delicious pastries from Delice around the corner. The croissants and other breads are legit. I also had a turkey panini that was amazing! And a very generous portion. It came with a side of Arugula, Wich was nice, but the French vinaigrette was not great. So I recommend to get it in the side. They probably have something else but I didn't ask. Got my order to go, and didn't take that long. Fresh Carrot-Orange juice was great too."}
{"text":"Took the light rail to Tempe for lunch. Delice Bistro was recommended by some friends.   We got there around mid afternoon. There were only a few people eating and no line. Expect counter service here with a large menu board that you order from. We ordered a Sausage Egg Crepe and the Chicken Avocado Salad.   Our cashier was Borka and she was awesome! She answered our questions about the menu and told us to be sure and check out the extra dessert case. When she saw that we wanted to sit on the patio, she took our number over to one of the tables outside under  a cabana. She brought out our food shortly after.  Everything was good. Very tasty. The salad was simple, but hit the spot. A good choice for a lighter lunch. The crepe was big and filling. Much bigger than expected. We finished up and discussed which desserts to try. They all looked amazing! We decided on a Coconut Macaroon and the Croissant Bread Pudding. Both were yummy!  Great place for lunch or breakfast if you're in Tempe!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit and I expected good things as my first time was great.  This time I ordered the special of Salmon over vegetables with a beurre blanc sauce.  The salmon was good, but the vegetables werent there.  A mixed green salad was not my idea of veggies, but thats what appeared under my salmon.    Of greater concern, my four tablemates all got their dishes (crepes, soups, and sandwiches) within minutes whilst I waited for mine.  The server came out and apologized for the delay saying that they dropped it in plating and had to start anew.  Given the time passing, they must have played dropsy in the kitchen a few times before my dish came out.  When it did, I remarked to the server he could make it up to me with a dessert and he laughed.  To my surprise he did come over with the nutella crepe soon after.  I have to say, that was class, enough so that I didnt want to mention my lack of vegetables to him.   By now our group included a couple more (if you know people at ASU this is a common occurrence as they all pass by) so we ordered a few more desserts to share.  Overall, the crepe were good, the nutella, the lemon & sugar, the turkey and cheese all were tasty.  The soups were a baked potato and their fabulous tomato.  Im not a potato soup fan but I had to admit it was good!  And their tomato is lovely, rich but not too acidic.  We tried their creme brulee and the carrot cake, both were very good.   I will return, its nice to have a French place that isnt too pricy for a casual meal.  Hubs prefers meat and potatoes as real meals but he enjoyed this too.  Its also great to have a crepe place open past 2 or 3pm!  We were trying to find someplace new to try and it seems like all the casual crepery places are only open at lunch, so this was a good solution!"}
{"text":"Wonderful  crepes, salads and sandwiches. Prices are reasonable. A great spot on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"The quality of the  food is excellent but the customer service is way below par. We were given plastic silverware to eat our food because they were \"out of silverware.\" When I asked how that was possible the lady explains their dishwasher didn't catch up from the morning rush... We had to use plastic silverware until we requested again that we needed silverware considering our  banana foster could not be cut easily with a plastic knife. We were the only people in the cafe! How difficult is it to wash a pair of silverware? To make the experience worse  they also forgot to put in our chicken florentine crepe!! We  waited 10 minutes before asking b/c in the past our entrees have arrived at different times. I love the food and have raved about this place to friends and co workers but the lack of consistency and customer service will prevent me from returning.    3.8.2016   INCONSISTENT AGAIN. --I called to order a pick up and was FORGOTTEN about for 4 minutes while I heard the employee ringing up customers...when I finally hung up, I called back and the line was still busy..called back again to find out they were out of the rosemary chicken  panini and that it is being \"made again\" since it is always made from scratch. First of all, that does not make sense, if it's always \"made from scratch\" how are you out? Obviously to some degree that is pre-prepped which is fine but they clearly do not re-make it enough throughout the day to match service levels. They are constantly out of items! You should not have to wait until everything is at zero before re-stocking.. Delice bistro needs to take a course in how to operate a business . If they invested more in training their frontline employees and focused on how to operate efficiently they would make more money and have happier customers."}
{"text":"Almond croissant was delicious. Drip coffee was hardly warm. Service was not good - seems like a management problem."}
{"text":"After a second visit this place was really nice. Crepes were amazing!! Glad I got to try them!! Overall nice ambiance."}
{"text":"We went to this Bistro based on a recommendation. It wasn't very busy when we first went in & were able to put in an order right away. My friend & I both decided on the Rosemary Chicken Panini. Considering how busy it was (not too busy), it took a pretty long time to get our food.  Each sandwich was served with a small portion of greens topped with their mustard vinaigrette. I don't care much for greens but I'd say that the mustard vinaigrette was the best thing on the plate. I will preface by saying that I had made a substitution to my sandwich (ordered it with pesto instead of sundried tomatoes) but it didn't matter much since it didn't have the taste of pesto anyway. I thought the garlic spread had a really strong flavor and there was way too much cheese. There was also an off taste to the sandwich ... I'm not sure what it was. After only a few bites, I was tired of it.  The cookies looked so tempting that even though I wasn't too impressed with my meal, I thought I'd give it a chance. Probably should've thought twice because it got busier at the cash register & they switched cashiers to someone who wasn't at all efficient. It wasn't worth the few dollars I paid or the 10 minutes I waited for it. I'm not sure if I'll be back here."}
{"text":"I love delice!  Their pastries, caramel machiattos and fresh juices are my weakness!  Their staff is friendly and attentive. (Shout out to Borka, sorry if I didn't spell that right) I love coming to a place were they remember you.  I mean they should since I go 3-4 times a week lol. Everyone that works with me across the street has nothing but great things to say about Delice!"}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place based on other reviews on here. Yelp community, you have let me down. First off, I ordered a cappuccino \"for here\". It came to me, about 10 minutes after our food, in a paper cup. WHY WOULD I ORDER A CAPPUCCINO IN A PAPER CUP???? By the time it got to my table over half the foam at dissipated. I didn't ask for a $4 half cup of coffee, I asked for a cappuccino, foam and all. No matter, the espresso was very weak and bland anyways. That entire scenario seems to be a very common theme here in the Phoenix area, as I have actually only had one decent espresso drink since moving here. I also ordered a crepe, with butter and sugar. What I received was a dry, raw tortilla sprinkled with powdered sugar. In the words of my fiancée, \"it's not that it doesn't taste good, it's just the worst crepe I've ever had\". She ordered the hazelnut chocolate mouse, and if it hadn't been so just-okay I would be rating at only one star. I do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We stopped in for two hot chocolates . And boy were they yummy! Made from scratch and very rich!  We had already ate dinner , but the menu looked impressive . Simple quick and delicious . The treats they bake looked pretty darn good too!  The staff was super sweet, helpful and seemed to enjoy their jobs. Especially the staff member who made the hot chocolates ! She brought out marshmallows and they made my night. I haven't had one in years lol .    We will be back and I can not wait ..I want this restaurant to be in my neighborhood     !"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!! I had a really great salad and my friend had an amazing quiche! The customer service was amazing! You have to top off your experience with a macaroon! And don't forget to take a baguette home with you!!! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!   Had the roast beef au jus, and the others in my party had the Delice Burger on a baguette.  Everyone loved their meal. It was very quiet when we were here.  Service was great. Will be back!"}
{"text":"So I finally gave in and try this place! It was very pleasant and the service was very nice! The crepe isn't all that wow but the macaroons were very tasty and sweet! The green tea ice was good, the environment was very relaxed and the place is very clean! I would come back again but for macaroons only! (: great place!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times had issues.   Let me start by saying their croissants, crepes and coffee is pretty good, if you don't mind paying pretty high prices.  As for my visits:  The first time I sat on the patio but the doors auto locked, so to use the bathroom or refill my coffee, I had to go to the door and knock and wait for a server to let me in, which happened 3-4 times and was just annoying. They do not have an exit from the patio to walk around so we were just trapped there.  My last visit, the door problem was fixed but the staff abruptly took my crepe plate away before I was finished (like 1/3 left) and I ordered a chocolate scone which was the absolute worst thing I have put in my mouth on a long time. It had zero chocolate flavor, it tasted like dirt. Literally dirt. I'm not exaggerating.  Other than that, outdoor tables are pretty dirty with bird poop on them.   I normally wouldn't be this critical about a place but paying $20+ for a couple of baked goods, a crepe and some coffees, I expect something better."}
{"text":"There is a good energy in this place even though I think my breakfast here was OK and didn't find what I came for, I still think this is one of the good places to try first when you come to Tempe."}
{"text":"Gotta give this place big thanks for taking care of the GIANT crowd gathered for the Tempe Christmas tree lighting event & parade last Sat night!!  Our group settled in one of the cabana tables on the patio to watch the light parade, tree lighting and Tempe Town Choir performance and enjoyed every minute!  Hot drinks and snacks made our evening extra special, and we were very impressed how the staff handled what must've been a crazy explosion of customers with great attitudes and attentive service!  We can't wait to come back and enjoy this cute place on a normal day!"}
{"text":"I purchased some sweet treats for an event here and to say that they won the hearts of my guests would be an understatement! We had fruit tarts, decadent chocolate desserts, and macarons. All were heavenly! I have heard that their crepes are phenomenal as well so I will most definitely be back to try them in the future! Their cupcakes were also adorable and would make the perfect Birthday surprise for a friend or coworker. I can't say enough about this hidden gem in Tempe, right off of Mill Ave. See you soon, Delice!"}
{"text":"All the food was great (lots of vegetarian options!) and the server was very friendly. Only draw back is no wine."}
{"text":"This place has awesome crepes! Ive tried a few different flavors but the strawberry Nutella crepe is by far my favorite. They are open late on the weekends which is convenient."}
{"text":"This place is super cute! I came here after a quick hike at Papago Park and wanted something light to eat.  The outside patio is a great place to eat if the weather permits.  They have adequate amounts of umbrellas to shield you from the sun so that you can enjoy being outside.   My boyfriend and I both ordered a Nutella Iced Macchiato.  It was pretty good, but the nutella wasn't fully mixed into the drink.  I kept gettings chunks of nutella through my straw, whereas at other business that serve a nutella drink, it is completely dissolved into the drink. The food was also good.  The portions are a bit on the smaller end, but it's something I expected out of a \"bistro\" restaurant.  Don't expect their breakfast items to be a heaping plate.   The cashier who helped us was a bit ditzy and annoying.  I'm not sure if it was because I was just tired from my hike and I was hangry, but she didn't seem to know much.   I can see myself coming back to try their desserts and more drinks, but I don't think we'll return for any full meals."}
{"text":"Really friendly people. Good food at a great price. Pastries are a must! Very European feel. Still could work out a few kinks (person making our sandwich was asking questions very loudly about how to make it) but overall great place to grab a bite before a movie!"}
{"text":"Friendlyish staff. I'm not a stickler for service but they ought to be more careful the way they place food on their patrons table. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they were in a bit of a rush.  Food wise I had the chance to try the French toast, turkey sandwich, and the turkey Swiss crepe.  The turkey sandwich and crepe needed more seasoning. I would choose the crepe over the sandwich.   The French toast was perfect!"}
{"text":"Super cute little café! Came here after lunch at Chop Shop for macarons and they were delicious"}
{"text":"Nothing special. I tried two crepes, one savory and one sweet. Neither one was anything to write home about.   The savory crepe I had was the Chicken Florentine crepe. It was pretty basic, chicken, spinach, mushroom and cheese. The chicken was dry and the other ingredients were fairly sparse. In fact, I pulled most of the chicken off because it was like eating cardboard.  Could have used some seasoning, sauce or other flavoring.   The sweet crepe I tried was the Smores crepe. I picked it because the description sounds delicious. However, it was more than disappointing. It was the basic crepe with chocolate, diced marshmallows and chunks of graham cracker. None of the ingredients were melted or mixed together. So the different textures threw me off.   I might go back to try some of their other dessert selections but I won't go back for the crepes."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Went here for lunch and I can't wait to go again! The bread is freshly baked and tastes amazing, crunchy on the outside with a soft, flavorful inside. The meat and the cheese are fresh and delicious. The people who work there are very polite and willing to help if you need it. A little piece of France in Tempe, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for our food and it was not very good. They thought we had left the restaunt, but after paying over $20 for our food why would we leave. They did try to make amends by giving us free dessert, but we didn't like the dessert. Overall would not recommend this place to eat."}
{"text":"Cute place right off of Mill Avenue with a nice dog friendly patio!  The service was a little slow, but it was worth the wait for the savory chicken crepe with spinach and mushrooms I enjoyed.  The macaroons looked tasty, but were hard and not very flavorful...thinking I just picked wrong and the rest of the sweets case was amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! The staff is friendly and the food is great!  It's all made there, no big cooperate kitchens. The prices are reasonable and I just can't get over how good the food is. For sandwich my favorite is the Rosemary chicken panini, the tomato soup is tasty and I love the salads. And let's not forget the cookies, which are best served warm!"}
{"text":"The service felt like blah and i paid $15 dollars for a regular crepe and a smoothie. I do not mind spending that amount it if it was worth it but i could've got the same service and items for less at an ihop. I like their menu and the place is cute but way way overpriced. I regret coming here:("}
{"text":"I ordered a turkey panini, salmon quiche, and s'mores crepe for delivery. The panini was INEDIBLE. It had turkey and bread slapped together and lacked the brie and walnuts that it was supposed to have. For the first time in my life, I had to throw out the sandwich because it was awful. The salad that came with it was wilted and brown. That went in the trash as well. Why did I waste $9 on that?? The other things that came in my order were tolerable, but still disappointing. The $10 quiche was small and mostly crust. The crepe was priced at $6 on the menu, but when it arrived with the receipt, I'd been charged $8. I'm disappointed and feel misled. Worst of all, I spent more than $30 on food that tastes like balls."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Tempe. After trying it for the first time, I came back the next day. Their almond crossiants are very yummy and flakey. Also I tried the basil pesto, banana almond protein shake, and their cappuccino, all very good! My sister tried the Nutella machaitto iced,and she said it was really good, every once in a while you get globs of Nutella mmmm!! She also said the classic crossiant french toasts were very good, only 7 dollars for 3 crossiants! Not too bad! I would come here everyday if I could!!"}
{"text":"I ordered food from this place, had it delivered with post mates. The plus side of this was it was fast! I had my food within 20 min of placing the order but I don't know how much Delice had to do with it.  But when I got the food I was disappointed  The panini was lacking all flavor and chicken and cheese like advertised. It was all bread. The tomato soup tasted like crushed tomato with water added to it.  I won't order from this place, or visit to be honest.  Upset that I wasted $20 on this meal."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a whim, as I was running an errand next door and when it was over I was hungry. I ordered the first thing I saw on the menu, which was Quiche lorraine.  It was the best Quiche Lorraine I have had! It also came with a side salad with like a sweet mustard dressing. It took a little longer than I expected and I was anxious with a fussy newborn infant. but it really was a delicious Quiche and I would love to try other things there when I am able to be more leisurely."}
{"text":"There is a reason why I gave it 1 star. Food and pastries are delicious, this is the second time I come to this place and they always give me terrible customer Service. I asked for what was the soup of the day and the cashier have me a weird look and said \"I don't know\" with some attitude. Their customer service sucks! Also the restaurant was dirty like they didn't clean the floor for the entire day. CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS!!!!"}
{"text":"I work right across from Delice and I always have good service here, not to mention the authentic French cuisine, pastries and desserts! I eat here at least twice a week, it's worth trying."}
{"text":"Outstanding crepes, croissants and service!  Delightful place!  Nice location, made to order crepe, servers were awesome.  Pretty outdoor eating area."}
{"text":"I have been to Délice multiple times and on other occasions the service has been fine, however this occasion it was leaving a lot to be desired. The past times when we have come in the store is moderately clean, although there is always some sort of mess that requires the staff to clean it and it usually takes a while for it to get cleaned up; tonight was no different and there were multiple spills throughout the store, I decided to order an affogato and a chocolate croissant. The affogato was served in a to-go cup and the chocolate croissant was a lie; it had no chocolate to be found in it whatsoever.  Only half way through did I discover that it was in fact a croissant with the smelliest cheese I have ever had the misfortune of tasting.  The main problem is that even though it was 10:00pm the staff was preoccupied with work in the back or just that they were horribly, horribly understaffed.   I want to come back but if the service is anything like tonight then it's simply not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"This is a big \"bistro\" for Mill Ave and it's sitting at a prime location. I think this bistro is in process of being renovated as well as getting ready to serve alcohol. A friend and I went to grab breakfast at 10am on a Sunday and there was a tiny feeling of disarray on one end of the restaurant. While the quality of the baked goods like croissants and tartlets were quite good, there was a bit a disorganization with service created by the fact that there was only one server and one person at the cashier trying to fulfill orders from a small queue that was gradually forming. The cook (maybe only one person show) got my friend's order wrong and added an ungodly amount of cheese that anyone would have trouble digesting. It took about 15 min to get her food when we were only the 2nd or 3rd customers in the bistro (I ordered a croissant). Having had strong hopes for this restaurant after tasting Postmate delivered dessert, I'm giving this place a 3 for disorganization."}
{"text":"Love the latte here..has very smooth taste. Large is huge too. Gets my morning going well. Spinach ricotta croissant was yum. Friendly staff. Lovely spacious decor. Wifi too!"}
{"text":"There is nothing like have a poor food experience right before going to see a movie. That just makes it all great, right?   We decided to have breakfast prior to our movie at 11:10 am. Located right across from the theater, this seemed like a good choice. Knowing that crepes and croissants are served, well hell yes! And light traffic on a Sunday morning at 10am in the 3rd and mill district, score!   Wrong. Counter service was slow,  and already bogged down by a party of 8 that was ahead of us. I ordered Eggs Benedict, she orders chicken panini, and i get a raspberry Danish. 30 minutes age ordering our food,  our entrées were brought out. The panini was decent, but nearly 4 hours later I'm still trying to figure out how,  i got cold toasted bread, hot eggs, and warm hollandaise sauce. The Danish was not brought out with the meal, but was kindly given to me by the overwhelmed order taker up front.   I don't know what the issues were that had everything bordering on clusterfuck when we went, but i hope they get worked out. I do find it doubtful I'd be willing to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Superb French / European bistro.  Excellent pastries and super fresh ingredients.  Small breakfast / brunch menu, but ample and very high quality. The mocha I had was the best ever: illy expresso and the absolute finest chocolate.  A pleasant little eatery!"}
{"text":"Great food but horrible service first delivery order took over an hour and a half to arrive because they forgot to put the order in (ordered via grub hub). Second delivery order took almost two hours restaurant did not offer anything but an excuse of abundance of incoming orders and they wanted to deliver all together.  Claimed their driver would call with an eta which they didn't.  Grub hub apologized and offered coupons for us which was way more than what the actual business had to offer. I've been in the business I get being busy but two hours is just unacceptable I couldn't even enjoy my food once it finally arrived."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm officially amending my previous review of Delice Bistro. I've been back quite a few times since and the staff has been wonderful. It's so nice to get your coffee and amazing breakfast pastry from someone who smiles at you and says hello. It makes me smile and say hello back!"}
{"text":"I am torn, too many good reviews and I won't be able to get a table, not enough and they close, but I cannot lie; this place is awesome. The crepes were the fluffier I've ever had, and I adore the atmosphere."}
{"text":"It was quite a surprise to see such a spot sprout in the middle of Tempe, something that I've been looking forward to for a while now so we decided to try it and what a mistake. Customer service has got to be the worst I've ever seen maybe because it was the owners who were helping us out? The food was ok, nothing close to the real French deal. So we decided to give it another try and we were again greeted with what has got to be terrible service: the door was open so we walked in and asked to PICK some already made pastries but oh no they were closed and so they couldn't charge us even though they were charging for the crepes outside. Watched the guy making the crepes and his hands were dripping water all over them. Oh well, au prochain!"}
{"text":"In short: overpriced, poor service and extremely underwhelming. Came here for Sunday brunch with my boyfriend. I ordered eggs Benedict and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Florentine Crepe. I made sure to specifically ask for runny eggs, however after I got them and cut into them, I realized they were completely cooked to a hard yolk, and the croissant the eggs came on was a soggy sloppy mess. My boyfriend's underseasoned chicken Florentine was heavily lacking chicken, the cheese was unmelted and the Crepe itself was undercooked in some parts. I wouldve politely sent to food back and asked for it to be corrected, if only any of the servers thought to come and ask us how our meal was. Not sure if the management changed recently, but one thing is for certain: the quality of the food and service DEFINITELY has, and certainly not for the better."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is always fresh and taste amazing. Every time I'm out this way I make an attempt to stop by. It doesn't matter if it's for dessert or dinner they have something for everyone. If I lived closer I would definitely come here to work on my dissertation. Despite the fact that it's in the heart of mill it's very quiet. I will always come back to this location."}
{"text":"Great Nutella crepe, but I am very disappointed with the customer service. After checking out, My friend asked if we could eat there because we were given the food in a to go box and the employee said \"yeah, just clean after yourself\" then I asked what time they closed and she said 9, and it was only 7:30. Then my brother asked if he could have a water cup and she said no and walked away. Then the other employee gave him the cup. Worst customer service ever. Used to be one of my favorite places to eat crepes. Definitely not coming here again."}
{"text":"This is the Zooey Deschanel of food. It's cute but dry and ultimately unfulfilling.   I went in with some friends around 9pm. We shared a carrot cake, chocolate cake, 2 macaroons, and a fruit tart (the cakes are tiny and precious). 9 is a little late for a bakery but they're open until midnight. And a carrot cake doesn't get that dry after 12 hours. That cake was 3 or 4 days dry. Macaroon was chewy. Chocolate cake was good but it was actually white cake with chocolate ganache.   Anyway, service was a bunch of teenagers who were more interested in each other. They were fine. We didn't have any problems with them.   If you're still trying to impress someone, take your date elsewhere."}
{"text":"Cheers to more local dining options on Mill ave!  As of late and partly due to being single and craving sweets ( I understand why girls love cake) I've been in a macaroon kick. This was place was on the must and to do list of French pastries.     I alway stand by on my rule of trying to eat at a place twice. So here's the skinny...  Macaroons~   Not much on availability: they bake them every other day? Why... Short supplies, lack of supplying their best ones is kinda of a number. However I was able to get two of them.  The pbj mac wasn't very tasty. No hint of peanut butter... Lame. And the jelly flavor didn't really serve itself well. Odd flavoring. The chocolate was good, rich and sweet.    Waffles~ They didn't have the waffles, an item that's listed. I could not get a reason as to when or why. The cashier and hostess said they a made randomly and don't know when they would be available. Once a gain, super odd.  I could live with a set date for when they are but I'm not stopping in daily to check.    Croissant~   That item was more of hit.  Just firm enough, heist flaky enough. It's nice for them to heat it up for yah.    At some point I'll come back to sample the crepes but until. I'll just keep on keeping on."}
{"text":"What an incredible find this was! Perfect date night treat before or after the movies across the sidewalk! The macaroons are ridiculous."}
{"text":"i ordered delivery through grub hub and if the food wasn't totally cold (may have been grub hubs fault) or the poached egg wasn't completely cooked thru and they hadn't given me macaroons rather than petit fours like i ordered it would have been pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I am a grilled cheese and tomato soup snob....I can't get enough of it here!  Their bread is amazing, the salmon quiche is so flaky and yummy!  Staff are friendly and service is solid.  This isn't fast food or a industrial/corporate kitchen - this is hand crafted deliciousness that is worth waiting a few moments for!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an assortment of desserts to take to a dinner we were invited to. Got 5 different desserts: carrot cake, cheesecake, coconut cake, fruit tart, and chocolate hazelnut cake/mousse. All were delicious, and the other members of our dinner party loved sampling all the different types. They were a hit!  If we lived nearby, I know we would return on a regular basis.  I noticed comments about poor service. I did not experience this.  I was greeted immediately and, from the moment I walked in, an employee was assisting me with my selection and carefully boxing up my desserts. I thought the service was perfect."}
{"text":"Literally, $9 for a handful of romaine lettuce. If you can't afford to make a salad, close."}
{"text":"The cofee is so delicious they grind their own beans which pairs well with their delicious pastries."}
{"text":"This little place is full of charm and amazing eats! Most of all Borka delivers amazing customer service and always goes the extra mile to ensure that your meal is magical. I highly recommend you try the goat cheese salad!! Love this place forever!"}
{"text":"So I tried this place when they originally opened. That day I walked over with my dog and ate on their patio. It was 8 am, and nice out. They forgot about us on the patio. My dog overheated. By the time I got my order (2 hours later) it was cold and I had to quickly eat it to get my dog home (I didn't want to wait for them to bag it up to go because who knows how long that would take). I swore I would never try it again.   Today I thought I would give this place another shot, because they may have had some opening gitters to work out. From the time I ordered I was disappointed once more. My family helped to start numerous restaurants through the years, and it is a very tough business to succeed at. I don't understand how they are still open. First I ordered a SMALL coffee and the girl at the counter charged me for a large. 2) the coffee was old and cold. 3) once again, the wait time for my food was unacceptable. No one apologized for the wait. I had to remind them that it was my food when they came out with it. The omelette was actually pretty good (the reason for two stars instead of one). The customer service however, needs some much more improvement"}
{"text":"I went to Délice in search of macarons, while at Deélice all I ordered was macarons, so this review doesn't have to do with their other food- I've never had it, it could be phenomenal. Their macarons on the other hand were't phenomenal, they were far from. They were extremely crunchy (not in the good way), on top of that, they were room temperature. They lacked the chewy texture with soft gooey inside that I crave in a traditional macaron. These are a little bit on the lower price side, of $1.50 per cookie, BUT they were on the smaller side. To their merit, the person who helped me at the counter was extremely kind and helpful. The interior was nicely decorated and fun. I would return to try their food, but not for their macarons."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service isn't great.. Don't bring your baby to work, especially behind the counter, and then serve customers with the baby holding their food!"}
{"text":"I have seen delice bistro on mill several times going to the movies with my boyfriend and wanted to go cuz it's a European bistro. I have lived overseas for a few years so my standards for certain things like European food is very high. But I'm also one on those people who live off of grub hub and eat24. So when I had noticed that they finally deliver I was soooo excited cuz now wat the opportunity I was waiting for and I have to say the results were absolutely amazing. It was basically love a first bite. So I kinda went overboard with the ordering like always but it was totally worth it. The salmon criss ant benadict was perfect the omlette was light and super fluffy I also go the caprese salad and a turkey and egg sandwich again amazing and the iced chocolate was a perfect finish to my binge eating breakfast. I have definately found my new European spot. It really tastes like the little bistro in the village I lived in when I was living in n Europe."}
{"text":"Loved the place and the food but the service Sucks! The owners son is really nice and is literally the only person that has customer service here!  Girls never know anything ... Can't get order right ... They bring u the wrong stuff ... Wrong size .... And to other tables ... You literally have to yell at them were the food goes.  Now they have a new cash register system. you can literally stand there for good 15mins. that is, if the person ringing you up is not busy finding where on earth to deliver the food for other people.  They also have an app that none of the employees is aware of! The app keeps texting me I have a free drink or a free pastry or it says we miss you at Delice bistro .... So come and none of the employees knows a thing ... On top of it they tell you to put stop to the app lol ...  I doubt I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Delice opened not long before I moved out of town and I'm SO SAD that I didn't have more time to keep going back. Cute atmosphere, convenient location near campus, and the food is to die for. Get the Nutella croissant French toast!"}
{"text":"Pretty large French bistro right in the centre of downtown Tempe. Lots of crepe options as well as sandwiches and sweets. I went with the ham and cheese crepe, a Nutella mocha, and a pain au chocolate (chocolate-filled croissant). The crepe wasn't the best I've had as it was a little dry/flakey and didn't have a lot of cheese, but was still very good. I much prefer a soft, fluffy crepe and the filling oozing out the folds. The croissant was delicious as well as the mocha. The service wasn't the best. I would have rather picked up my food from the counter than had to wait for the staff to drop it off by number. They were really slow with our drinks and the croissants came out first, but were heated. I wish I had tried the chocolate but was full from the food. Overall, a decent experience and fun to try for something a bit different (not a lot of French options in the Metro) but not a place I'd go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Really good caramel and Nutella macchiado, I had the lemon tart good and my wife had the chocolate hazelnut tart really good too... Just a patio a little bit dirty and the speaker broken was way too loud. Nice staff (Someone start to clean after few minutes, 5 stars!)"}
{"text":"The drinks are great. The environment is nice. I prefer AJS pastries better and they cost less. I think this place can be a 4 star if the attitudes of the workers were better. They lack some energy with customers"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Delice Bistro on a Saturday morning. I was surprised by two things - 1. How big the place is. For some reason I was expecting something smaller. Maybe because it's a bistro? But what's in a name... 2. I was surprised that it was not busier. Granted, it's still summer so maybe once students are back it will pick up.  It's an order-at-the-counter kinda place so my boyfriend and I did just that. I went with a crepe - mushroom, egg and cheese. He chose the bananas foster French toast. We also got a chocolate croissant to share.   The croissant was very good. Super flaky, lots of chocolate. Yums all around. Unfortunately the meal sis not quite match the greatness of the pastry. My crepe came out plain on a plate. No garnish, no sauce, no presentation - no nothing but the crepe. And now, I know I ordered a MUSHROOM crepe. BUT. It had way too many mushrooms. It really overpowered the egg and cheese. And the whole thing was just kinda dry. A nice sauce would have really added a lot. The crepe itself was very good, however. I bet their sweet crepes are good.  My boyfriend's French toast had a similar ingredient overload issue - way too much caramel! The first few bites were good but then it just got too rich. Less is more, you guys.  Since the croissant was such a win, on the way out we did grab a chocolate chip cookie. Like the croissant, it was done very well. Super fresh, lots of chocolate. Yummy, yummy.  So I'll definitely give them props for their bakery treats - really, really good. If they would just even out their entrees, this place would be 5-star worthy."}
{"text":"Well, we ordered from here and it took over 2 hours. Then the food was cold. The delivery girl spilled our juice and gave us half a cup filled of juice and didn't even offer to refund us or anything. Not really worth the $30 I spent. Mac and cheese was good after we nuked it. Then I went for the dessert. I really only ordered from here cause I wanted something chocolatey. So I ordered the mouse cake. They brought me a chocolate croissant. So in the end, I feel like I got scammed here. At least is was chocolatey."}
{"text":"The service was great! Kevin made our group feel so welcome and got everything out to us so quickly! I got the grilled cheese crepe and the macaroons and they were great!"}
{"text":"I love this place their food is really good, desserts are also good, and the coffee is amazing.  Their macrons are just okay I tried better they tend to feel more dry/crunchy than usual to my taste.  Service is solid. The plate sizes is also good."}
{"text":"Cute place! It's tucked into the west side of Mill Ave so it's not visible from there. It's a good sized space and when we came in around 1030 we basically had the place to ourselves. The young man working the register was friendly and patient as we checked out the menu and asked questions. We both ordered Nutella crepes, I added bananas and my friend got strawberries with hers. We also ordered drinks, she got a hot coffee drink and I got an iced white chocolate mocha. I loved my drink and the crepes were pretty good as well.   They've got French desserts and savory items on their menu, including lunch items like sandwiches.  It's a good alternative to a busy breakfast spot like Ncounter."}
{"text":"Living nearby to this French cafe: slightly tucked behind Mill Ave, has been my breakfast pastry blessing. Amazing chocolate croissants (esp. warmed), great hot chocolate, and coffee (esp. the Nutella mocha) and it's fast for when you're on the go!"}
{"text":"while its close and convenient for me, this resto never fails to dissapoint in serving time :("}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place, but ended up being disappointed. I ordered a Nutella Latte and it just tasted like chocolate milk with a spoonful of Nutella at the bottom. Definitely not worth the $6. (and I love Nutella!)  Additionally, the customer service non existent. No personality or hello, thank you, etc.   I sadly have to say I won't be back, especially with plenty of other better options on Mill."}
{"text":"Went in to check it out Nice decor and service I wanted a crepes florentine They told me they had no béchamel sauce So instead I got mushrooms and cheese But they failed to mention that there would be NO SAUCE EITHER it was so dry it hurt to eat it Sauce usually makes a dish If you're out of it then don't serve that dish."}
{"text":"For the last week, Delice has failed to purchase large coffee cups. Because of this, patrons only have the option of having a small drink. Inventory is supposed to be a priority when owning a restaurant. It's sad to say that inventory is of no importance to Delice. Each day, the staff apologizes. If it wasn't for the nice lady at the counter, and the salmon Benedict, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I was on mill on Friday and wanted to come in to delice to get a salad, and it was a crappy experience. They had to remake it twice due to a food allergy I have and the cashier was making lewd conversation with the cook. They salad didn't even end up being good. Not the standard of quality that I'm used to from them."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on the way to Starbucks and am very happy we did! It's tucked away near W6 and Pedal Haus Brewery so I'm not sure if I even would have found it otherwise.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The food is excellent, I recommend the Rosemary Chicken panini. Good prices and all of the fresh juices are refreshing and tasty, I recommend the Hangover Cure.  Will definitely be returning for breakfast or brunch, there's also a wide selection of French desserts and pastries. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I ordered their turkey with avocado sandwich on baguette bread- which tasted fresh, simple, and delicious.  Their vanilla latte is very good- not bitter at all.  I also tried their Go Green juice and it was tasty and had a zing to it (the ginger, probably).  Their food has great quality to it- and this is coming from someone who lived in Europe for 6 years. Simple but fresh and tasty ingredients= really good food. Can't wait to sample the other things in the menu!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a breakfast place to try on Friday when I stumbled onto Delice.  I decided I'd send in my usual questions regarding my corn allergy & which pastries (I had a list!), crepes, & other items could I try in an email to their FB site around 1 am on 5/21, & I received a reply, w/ exciting answers & a welcome to visit just 8 hours later!  Most of the pastries that piqued my interest were powdered sugar-free & only received their dusting after baking, so whoever replied (unsigned) told me to let them know when I was visiting (Friday!) & to ask for Master Baker Matt, who'll have the pastries ready for me.  Friday morn, I received an email that asked around what time would I arrive.  I said I was leaving in a few minutes.  When I arrived around a quarter to 10 am, Maddie had already helped me locate a public garage nearby & let me know that parking will be validated (up to $4).  After greeting Maddie in person & meeting Master Baker Matt, who then told me that my pastries were almost ready, I placed in an order for an Eggs & Sausage crepe (on Maddie's referral), a medium-sized mocha (fyi, espressos here are made w/ Illy brand espresso) & a Bananas Foster French toast.  I'd asked her if there were other nuts that could be subbed for pecans, since I'm allergic, & there was a bit of confusion, but after awhile, she confirmed that I was ordering one w/ walnuts & no powdered sugar.  I paid the $32 plus change on my card & dropped a few dollar bills in the tip jar-- order @ the counter & food arrives @ the table.  I noticed that my receipt stated \"Nutella French toast,\" but didn't speak up since many other restaurants have used the same key for diff. items that have the same price.  In this case I should've, bec. Nutella French toast, w/ walnuts on top, was what arrived, but I'm getting ahead of myself, so let's backtrack a bit.  Soon after I paid & received my d'lish hot mocha, Matt brought out the pastries (pain au raisin, pain au chocolat, & an almond croissant) AND an eclair!  Matt revealed that the eclair was not going to have its chocolate coat, since the icing contains corn syrup, so I kindly asked if he could make a ganache, and he kindly obliged.  Well, I think from the photos I took, you can see that everything was wonderful!  The crackles of buttery layers of flaky crust were mesmerizing w/ each bite, & the flavors of both the bread & fillings were utter perfection- delightfully buttery, yet not too greasy nor too salty, & the fillings sweetened just right.  I could see vanilla bean flecks in both the cream filling of the pain au raisin, & in the light, yet flavorful pastry cream that nestled inside the eclair.  The fresh chocolate ganache added just enough decadence-- ooh la la!   Mom couldn't make it to breakfast, but the eclair that I brought home for her to try didn't last 20 minutes!  The tasty Eggs & Sausage crepe was a bit of a letdown, as I found it on the dry side (made w/ turkey sausage) & some of the potato chunks I had eaten were still a little raw.  The layers of crepe was substantial, as I'm used to smaller crepes.  This won't keep me from trying Delice's other savory crepes, but since I tend towards sweeter breakfasts, it may be awhile till you read an update.  The Nutella French toast, made from croissants, as do all their other French toasts, was good.  I prefer a heavier hand with Nutella, as well as added fruit, but I think most people would like it as is.  As tasty as it was, it's not Bananas Foster, so I let Matt know this when he had come around to ask how everything was.  He assured that the correct French toast was on its way, although it will be awhile.  No rush...  I sampled a lot of food yesterday, so I had to ask for boxes for my treats.  I was eager to photograph & taste the Bananas Foster, but it came boxed & ready to go.  I managed to take a pic before trying a few bites...  I think all French toasts should be made w/ croissants, but that's just my opinion.  I'll be ordering this again very soon!  Thank you, Delice & staff, for the patience & hospitality you've shown me!  You may expect to see Mom & me soon (& an email with my pastries order in your FB inbox)!"}
{"text":"I used to work right next to this place, so I was very excited when they first opened. While I gave it several chances, I always walked away feeling underwhelmed. Their prices are too high for what you get.  It's nice to be tucked away off of the major Mill traffic, so maybe it'd be best to sit & work there & sip on coffee or tea, but I'd say skip the food from Delice."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. You order inside and they bring you your food. The restaurant is beautiful. The outdoor patio is so pretty and has string lights lining the outside. I really enjoyed the crepes and everyone loved their sandwiches. The staff was so awesome and when they made a mistake left the food for us to enjoy. Definitely recommend this place. Outdoor patio is dog friendly also."}
{"text":"This may have been my fault for ordering from GrubHub; however, the service was subpar considering the amount I spent for the food. 30 minutes after the expected delivery time, we called the restaurant to find out if they had received the order. The gentleman on the phone said that the delivery driver had disappeared and apologized for the inconvenience. As we were on the phone, the driver had finally shown up...a friend seemingly alongside her. I don't know exactly what happened (if she went to go pick someone up before dropping off our food?), but I do know that the food arrived cold and soggy and pretty late. Very disappointing. I would like to give this place a second chance, but I will never order delivery again, especially with such an irresponsible driver."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today.  Ordered green ice tea and a trukey brie panini.  Also got a cup for water.  The ice machine was out of ice and the shield around it was covered with caked on food.  Service was fast.  They first brought out a black iced tea, which I told her I did not order.  Then the same waitress came back and asked me if I'd ordered an Americano coffee....no.....finally my iced tea came out.  It was absolutely undrinkable. Nasty, bitter and likely very old supply. My panini came out, and I was pleasantly surprised to see it was accompanied by some greens.......  until I tasted the mustard salad dressing.  It tasted like 100% mustard - could not eat it. The panini was very thin, scant meat, cheese and apples, bland, and the turkey on some bites tasted off.   I left it all there and went to anothe establishment for lunch. I will not be back."}
{"text":"As someone who just came back from a vacation to Europe (Barcelona - Viva la Catalan!) I can say that Delica Bistro does have a European feel to it, especially the pastries. I had a delicious croissant made with orange, sesame and Thyme that was just delicious and the sampler shortbread cookie I tried, wonderful! As for the coffee beverages, I had a double espresso for $2.50 (quite reasonable), made with Lilly coffee, which seems to be the Euro brand of coffee. My neighbors, also along for a local bike jaunt, had crepes, that were just lovely! I strongly recommend you check this place out and due to its location by the area off Mill near the AMC Centerpoint theaters, feels like you are on a piazza.   Be advised they just opened and are still working out some operational bugs. My friends crepes took a bit of time but someone came over and apologized so they know they need to work some things out (they also came by a short time later with the option to sample a shortbread cookie so de nada). I did get my espresso in a small paper cup and hopefully there is  the option to also get it in a small cup. I do like that there are free cups for water for the taking at the register when you pay for your food and other drinks. They are also supposed to have baguettes available for purchase - a bit on the high end at $3 but hey, a Euro style bakery option in walking distance of my house so I'm not complaining.  It also feels strange that their espresso does not come with a side of sugar so if you want it sweeter, get it off the side area (though they only had non-sugar substitutes when I was there but once again, newly opened). I'll be there at least once a week for a morning pastry and coffee drink so I'll see them work it out.  The one thing I hope they are working on is a liquor license as it is a shame not to sit out on the patio, near the piazza style area with a nice bottle of wine and maybe, if someone from there is reading this, until then they will provide a BYOB option with a corkage fee?    Other than that, a lovely place that I think will only grow in popularity and its nice to come back from Europe and find a little slice of Euro style living, right in my own backyard - Viva la Delice Bistro!  Update - went back today - service is still a work in progress as the owner works on developing the operational flow for the place but I did buy a whole grain baguette and it was amazing - little poppy seeds throughout that added a wonderful nutty flavor and the crust was chewy and crisp - I will definately buy them on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Food was SO good! However ordered online delivery through Yelp and did not get any of my special instructions. Thankfully they weren't for allergies but that is something that should be looked at... Delivery girl was nice though!"}
{"text":"the service and the people at delice are just so amazing! the food is done so quick and they literally make sure your satisfied with your meal. i honetly come here every other day just to hangout and get work done and also stuff myself with some strawberry nutella crepe :) Borka is such a genuine person and honestly keeps everything so perfect and classy !"}
{"text":"Great ice brew coffee and excellent service.  Love that they are open early and they give Chase employees a discount!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed by my experience here. I was doing the Downtown Tempe Bar Crawl and the deal at Delice was a $4 mini juice and chocolate croissant.  By the time we arrived they had run out of the chocolate croissants so their option was a small tiny butter croissant. It was like 2 bites of croissant and the juice tasted like canned Minute Maid orange juice. Definitely not worth the $4 plus tax that I paid for it.  The chocolate croissant other customers got were so much bigger so I think they should have given us a croissant comparable to size if they ran out. Felt massively ripped off."}
{"text":"The place is awesome, I always come here. The staff is so friendly and kind, especially Isabelle and Nick, they are the best !! They made my night with their kindness! Macaroons are so good and also the croissants, everything is fresh! I totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The pastries are fresh and delicious. The sandwiches are good sized portions and come with a tasty salad."}
{"text":"I only ate a chocolate filled croissant here, but it was REALLY good. It reminded me of a place that I used to go to as a kid in Phoenix called La Petite Boulangerie. I'll have to go back for a crepe or panini or something.   Decor was nice and light. The place was clean and smelled fantastic inside. The air was literally delicious. Service was great as well. There's lots of seating and a lovely patio that doesn't face Mill. It's across from AMC Centerpoint.   That's all I've got. I'll update later when I try more things. ;)"}
{"text":"Like all Cambodians, we are all donut and pastry experts. The dough was definitely done right so the pastries were amazing to say the least. I had their spinach croissant and it was delice-cious ;) Ate it so fast I forgot to instagram the pic #fattieproblems #followforfollow @chhapaya. Also tried their chocolate croissant and it was bomb.com.   Now the downside... Their macaroons weren't my favorite but I haven't had any good macaroons in AZ so I guess it's on par with other bakeries. The black coffee was lackluster. Although better than the coffee we have in our breakroom, I think the extra walk to cartel will be a better idea if you're coffee fanatic like I am.   Be sure to call an ambulance for the ambiance because the decor was killer. It's good to see restaurants take pride in the small details.  Goes to show how much respect they have for the craft.  Overall I give this place 5 stars because I came for the croissants and they delivered on my expectations.  Service was great and the ambiance was a nice bonus. Only take away I have is that with the thousands of Chase employees that are a walking distance away, having a great coffee selection will probably be the most profitable source of revenue if done right."}
{"text":"This is a cute location, the food is good and the crepes are reallyyyy good! The inside is very relaxing and the service has improved a lot! They have fresh tasty juices, perfect for breakfast, brunch, lunch with a friend or even a study spot. Go try it :)"}
{"text":"I got the Chicken Florentine Crêpe, it was pretty bland not worth the price. My friend got the Rosemary chicken panini which was amazing, great flavors! The vanilla latte and Carmel macchiato were not good at all they tasted like syrup. The employees were friendly, but there was trash all over the empty tables and it took the employees about 15 mins to pick it up."}
{"text":"Been here several times. Crepe is a must try. If you want something more than dessert, try sandwich or pasta. This is a place you can come by yourself and not feeling awkward.  But... their tropical ice tea is not really good hahaha"}
{"text":"So far no good.  The waitstaff is all yawning. The line took almost 20 minutes and the place is only half full. The tables all need to be cleaned as well as the floor. Hopefully the crepes are good."}
{"text":"I had the best croissant of my entire life here. It was holding turkey and Swiss and basil mayo, and it was incredible. I came here originally for millefeuille, and if you're expecting something like a Napoleon, you're out of luck. There's is a little 3 layer chocolate cake with something crunchy in between the layers. I'm guessing that's the millefeuille part. I wasn't a fan, but there wasn't anything bad about it. I just chose the wrong dessert. There are several others that looked delicious. Service was adequate, and we got our food quickly. I also love the mustard dressing that comes on the salad. I am definitely visiting again."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing! Everything I have had has been excellent! Great coffee, crepes, cookies, deserts, salad and sandwiches! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the service. Sometimes it can be inconsistent but the employees are always friendly."}
{"text":"By far this is the best place to come and study and  chat with friends! They have the best coffee/ freshly squeezed juices / deserts and one of the best sandwiches you'll probably ever have. Also their employees are by far the best ones I've ever seen. Very welcoming and friendly specially Nick and Isabelle !!! Highly recommend this place to everyone !!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the opening preview with our office. We ordered a bunch of items in order to sample:  1) The space is very bright and large. 2) coffee bar has inventive coffees (Nutella mocha, etc. Ice teas are made freshly brewed and poured over ice (European style). Also- uses Illy coffee. 3) baguette sandwiches are very large- bread is delicious. 4) croissant is one of the best I've had in AZ- a little dense, but very buttery. 5) macaroons are smaller than essence- but well prepared and fluffy.  Overall - very excited to have them on Mill and in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Tucked in the back corner of the center point on Mill is this gem, the ideas of the fusion of small Parisian corner bistro where the staff know you because you're a local and the contemporary American spin of \"we love it, but what if we could do it for the 21st century\".  I love the inconspicuous vine that Délice operates under, I feel as if they know that few know they exist and they like it that way, perhaps even that they're not concerned with negative review because they know their business will come from locals who know better.  For instance this restaurant is not afraid to try new things, I feel as if I can order any made up dish I'd like using the ingredients they have and they'll make it.  They seem less concerned with producing each dish as it was intended and more concerned with producing whatever makes you happy shame be damned.  That is not to say that what's on the menu isn't worthy is its own right, it is.  They have a few kinks to work out still indeed but I seem them ironing those out and staying in business for a very long time to come.  I wish only the best for Délice and will be glad to see them come into their own."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Would recommend to anyone. Mac n cheese is it of this world. Chicken pesto was fresh and tender. Yummmm"}
{"text":"This place was worth a second chance -- I suspected it would be.  Really great food.  The delivery was prompt the second time and the food was hot.  They treated us to a replacement for the initial screw up and we ordered the same thing.  It was perfect the second time.  Previous Review:  Well, I so desperately want to give this place 4 or even 5 stars.  Maybe I will eventually, but for now I have to go with two.   We ordered through eat24 and were given a delivery time of an hour.  An hour and fifteen minutes later I called to check and was told that our food should be here \"any minute\". Fifteen minutes later, I called again.  It came a few minutes later -- ice cold and kind of ruined.  The crepe was wet and cold from steaming in the box, condensing and then raining back down on the cooling crepe.  The French dip was just cold, still edible.  We microwaved it and revived it somewhat.  It was pretty good except that it came with a tiny cup of au jous that wasn't sufficient for even half of the sandwich, let alone a sandwich that had been microwaved and toughened up a little.  But it was still very good.  The spinach salad was a bit of a shock considering there wasn't a single leaf of spinach in it.  It was nothing but arugula with some tomatoes and walnuts (no Gorgonzola as listed either). However, it was fresh and the dressing was good.    The price was decent.  And I have to say that when I called a few times trying to track down my dinner, the staff was very nice and apologetic.  They explained that they had let the driver go home early and then were slammed with 30 orders.  So I can understand that ---- happens.  The food that we received was subpar, but definitely suggested that if served hot or not rushed (maybe he didn't realize how he was screwing up the spinach salad) I think it would be pretty damn good.  We will try it again someday and perhaps update with the review I think this place could achieve."}
{"text":"Good food, tasty deserts. Limited menu and a little funky in keeping the patio bussed, but great location on a Sunday morning. I had the turkey sausage/ egg crepe. Pretty danged good."}
{"text":"Loved this little french bistro! It was traditional, the ambience was lovely, customer service wonderful, prices resonable and the food was indeed delice! Now an all time favorite of mine. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love going here every time. Such a nice atmosphere. Inside or patio, it's a great place to spend some time and eat great quality food."}
{"text":"Cute cafe that seems to be really popular with the students.   We enjoyed our cafe mocha, lemon meringue tart and caramel macaroon, although the pastry prices were kind of on the higher side. We'd like to try more drinks and the crepe next time!"}
{"text":"I've been to Delice a few more times since October since I work right across the street. The food is always delicious, but the reasoning for my removing of one star is because of the service. There is one gal behind that counter that is always very friendly and smiling, but the others I've encountered look as if they don't want to be there and have this little bit of attitude when asked a question. Today a coworker and I went in for some drinks and breakfast sandwiches. We got our drinks quickly, which was nice as we were able to enjoy them while we sat and waited for our sandwiches. About 15, almost 20 minutes had passed and nothing. My coworker walked up to the counter to see how much longer the sandwiches were going to take. The girl behind the counter looked lost and flustered and she walked around like a chicken with it's head cut off. Finally, she came back and told us it would be a few more minutes. As we sat back down to wait for our sandwiches (I got an egg, turkey, cheese sandwich while my coworker got an egg, avocado, spinach sandwich) another gentleman went up to the counter to ask about their sandwiches as well. It was a different gal he had asked and with attitude she answered him (quite loudly) \"We have like 20 sandwich orders back there! It's going to take long! The chefs can only make two at a time, okay? We only have two pans back there.\" First off, it was very rude of her to be so short with the customer since he was just wondering (and had asked nicely) about his food. Second, I think going forward Delice might consider informing customers the estimated wait time on food if they are backed up. I didn't realize that there were only two pans and that only two sandwiches could be made at a time. Maybe consider putting a disclaimer somewhere that everything is made from scratch and made to order; that is why some items just take a little longer to make. I completely understand a restaurant wanting to make good quality food and I've personally waited anywhere from 30-40 minutes for food, because I knew that the love and quality put into it was going to be worth it. Like I said in the beginning, the food is delicious and at least that has remained every time I've been in there. It's really more the customer service that I had an issue with. Making the customer feel unwelcomed is not a good way to keep them coming back."}
{"text":"There's not a ton I can say about this place as I came here at night and there was a limited selection- I got an almond croissant (no chocolate ones available), but it was fabulous! It was flaky, rich, flavorful, and overall fantastic. I want to come back for more pastries and especially for the chocolate croissant.... yes please. Prices are average. I'll be back.   PS this place is by the AMC theatre.... back side of the building that houses fat tuesday and the like....."}
{"text":"I tried a crepe, nothing special and the weight time is super slow. The place is big but hardly anyone came. Waited 30 minutes just to get one single crepe. The only reason why I gave three stars is the place and i haven't trued enough of the other foods"}
{"text":"I saw good ratings, mostly, and I heard from a friend that their croissants were to die for, so I drove to Tempe to try them out. I could comment on a number of things, but I'll stay with the arrogance I encountered.   When I ordered the Croissant Benedict, I was very specific that I wanted my eggs poached medium well, even if the yolks got hard. I explained that I am one of those people who can not stomach runny egg whites. I know that makes me strange, but I literally can't put them in my mouth, so I am very clear when I order eggs. When I ordered, I emphasized that point to the extent that the cashier (you order at the counter before being seated) said \"yeah, I get you\". Whether or not she communicated that to the kitchen, the eggs I got (after waiting 25 minutes) had runny whites.   When I approached one of the chefs and explained it to him, as I watched, he went to one of the other chefs - presumably the one who cooks eggs. The chef he approached rolled his eyes and made a comment to the chef I had talked to and they laughed. I was standing right there - they could at least have had that exchange beyond my line of sight. Not a good customer moment. Bad eggs and arrogance.  Even though I had already paid for my food, and had eaten nothing. I retrieved my belongings from my table and I left. When I observe that kind of behavior, I don't know what they will do to whatever they bring me next. It may not be \"the thing\" to dislike runny egg whites, but when I have taken care to be very specific with my order, I am the one who should be rolling my eyes that you can't cook to my specifications.  This feels like a rant, and I guess it is. I don't generally write reviews like this, but no matter how good their pastries are, I would never spend money at this establishment again. I thought it was overpriced to begin with, but overpriced with attitude and poor execution is intolerable."}
{"text":"Really cozy place with good coffee (espresso based drinks!) and yummy crêpes. I love that they are open later than other crépe or brunch places. When I came, it was pretty quiet, so the atmosphere was really nice, but I can see it being busy. We got the Nutella Machiatto, Café mocha, raspberry Danish, and turkey and Swiss crépe. It was all really tasty!"}
{"text":"I loved this place until this past Sunday. A visit to the bathroom was when things went down hill. no toilet paper, no paper towels and the toilet did not work. I had to take off the lid and reach in to fix the flushing system myself luckily they had soap.   Good Job Delice, that was fantastic."}
{"text":"We went on day 1 and waited almost 45 minutes,  we chalked it up to 1st day opening.  earlier this week we stopped in only for some chocolate.  We stood there 5 minutes,  rang the bell and watched servers walk around oblivious.  We turned and left with no an acknowledgment...the chocolates LOOK delcious but the service has been atrocious and we wont be going back. Ive heard the same from several coworkers,  though those who had waited it out say the coffee is amazing"}
{"text":"By far the BEST croissants in Phoenix. They have a super flaky and crisp outside and slightly chewy inside. I haven't tried the food or other pastries there yet, because I usually just buy a bunch of the croissants."}
{"text":"This place has great pastries. I'm a big fan of the almond croissant (esp if they warm it a bit) and the hazelnut cake is to die for. Soooo good! They also have a nice crepe selection, both sweet and savory. I've tried both and they don't skimp out on the fillings. The apple strudel crepe was particularly good and the filling wasn't too sweet and the apples were still crisp. They have a nice coffee selection too.   I've been a few times and the service has been wonderful each time. Definitely one of my favorite bakeries in Tempe and I'll be back often!"}
{"text":"this place is 5 star plus on the quality of the food and the coffee. We came in for a pastry and coffee and well - wow very very nice. This is a great place near the big theatre, I am sure it may get crowded later in the day. we are early birds and virtually had the place to ourselves with a lovely helpful staff and great pastry. I looked over the chocolate counter and am certain it will be  tasty, somehow I resisted. returning to this place will be a a for sure. Ah  Tempe - So many good choices."}
{"text":"Location: it is located in the heart of mill avenue. Lots of seating areas in the inside and also on the outside. We saw two chefs making crepes out in the open when we had dinner across the street from there. The aroma definitely attracts our attention to this place. How can I pass up crepes???? Even though I was stuff from having one lbs of crab legs, I'll always make room for dessert.   Service: it was our first time here. The cashier was super friendly and patience with our lack of knowledge for their menu. Great service for sure.   Food: we ordered a Nutella banana crepes and a protein shake. The crepe is so thick and they were very generous with the banana filling.   Rating: I came from LA and this was one of my favorite dessert that I've always wish that Arizona will have. no doubt! I'll be here again and again and again ...."}
