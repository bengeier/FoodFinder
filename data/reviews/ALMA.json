{"text":"Second time at this restaurant.  The first was during a restaurant week and we enjoyed a great brunch menu but forgave the VERY SLOW service and long wait time for food after we ordered because of the newness of the restaurant and the special week.  However, months later (Feb'16), we returned with a reservation and were a party of four.  The service was just as slow if not slower! My husband arrived 30 minutes early and sat at the bar (3 other patrons) and waited 15 minutes to be acknowledged.  The food was \"okay.\"  We ordered 3 glasses of the same wine, two were the same, one was different, and we asked to simply return the third wine without replacement.  We were CHARGED FOR ALL 3 GLASSES.  Not worth the waits or the hassles."}
{"text":"Great breakfast so many choices and fabulous Gluten Free options. Great place for lunch ask for Eric best waiter ever!! The Blueberry Pie is frickin amazing!!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times and have had a great experience every time. The service is always very friendly. I've tried the pork chop with the sweet potatoes (mmmm) and the scallop special was amazing. Sit outside if weather permits."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we loved it! From the moment we walked in, we loved the friendly comfortable atmosphere. We got here in time to choose between their Happy Hour menu or the Dinner menu and were pleasantly surprised with the variety of choices on both menus. 

Once we sat down at our table, our waitress Lexie, made our visit exceptional. We could feel her excitement for the various dishes and we're so glad we followed her suggestions! My husband had the Arizona Medallions which were cooked to perfection. And their desserts are to die for!!

Reasonably priced, delicious food, and yummy desserts. This is our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Awesome place and very welcoming! We heard about this place from a local friend...The food and service was outstanding! I highly recommend the Tres Locus!"}
{"text":"Top notch friendly & attentive service. Inventive, delicious food that is fun to try and be more adventurous. Lovely patio. Totally scrumptious cocktails like the mango margarita garnished with chile candy slice. A fun and inventive spot!"}
{"text":"Ambiance was very nice: lively, hip, with beautiful decor. The menu is very varied, perhaps too much. They are supposedly south by southwest and they did have shrimp and grits, some tacos, and fried chicken.   Other things on the menu didn't seem to go. This included the Mediterranean platter with hummus and baba ghanouj, paella, and a vegetable tagine. 
I had the chicken mole. What arrived on my plate was surprising. It was basically half of a rotisserie chicken with a tablespoon of mole-ish sauce smeared on the plate.  The chicken was tasty but it definitely was not what I was hoping for.
My husband ordered the tagine. This was a huge plate of couscous with vegetables and sauce on top. Surprisingly it was so spicy that he couldn't really taste the veggies.  He likes spicy food but this was so intensely spicy that most people probably wouldn't be able to eat it. 
Service was kind and cheery but slow. 
Since the actual place is so charming we may come back for cocktails but won't be back for a meal."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast for the first time, my  friend took me here for  my Birthday. 
Every thing from the greet at the door to the waiter and of course the fantastic food. 
Every thing was excellent. All the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Had the biscuit with two different kinds of gravy. Friend had chilaquiles and eggs. She thought it was great. Will come back"}
{"text":"Great food and service.   My wife had rib-eye ravioli and I had coconut shrimp.   Both were prepared very well.  Would defiantly recommend"}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast, the \"Open Italian\" was delicious! Can't wait to come back for lunch and dinner on their beautiful patio. (Dog friendly!)"}
{"text":"Visiting for the weekend and it would feel like a crime for not trying this new SW spot! We went in with a critical mind, being LA foodies, and it exceeded expectation. The salsas had a perfect amount of heat, the chili verde was Fantastic with great texture and well balanced heat.  The fare was great for the conservative pallets at the table as well as the adventurous, so I have no problem give a full 5 stars here. Great remodel as well, tasteful and interesting."}
{"text":"My mom and I had a great lunch here recently. She had the salmon salad and I had the salmon sandwich, both were delicious! Our server Eric was very friendly and we look forward to returning in the near future. Can't wait to try their brunch! :)"}
{"text":"We just got back from Alma and it was pretty darn good! I ordered the coconut shrimp (which comes with 12), and they told me they were short, so they could only bring me an order of nine. Because of that, they told me I would not be charged for it and it was on the house! We also had the vegetable sautine, which was very spicy, but not as good as I thought it would be.

The ambience is nice, and the service is very friendly. This place is definitely worth being checked out. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had a great breakfast today in this newly opened restaurant. It was called Tres Locos. Very tasty and creative. Thank you Eric for recommending it."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great ambience - the decor is rustic and makes you feel right at home. 
Our server was so sweet and very accommodating.

The food here is amazing! I had the pork tenderloin and chorizo risotto. The flavors mixed beautifully together and made a delicious dish."}
{"text":"Lemon ricotta pancakes were fantastic!  Eric, our waiter, was great! So friendly.  He bought numerous  authentic Mexican dishes for us to try.  My only complaint was I didn't have room for it all!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was even better. Eric is a great asset to Alma. Went in for breakfast and came back for dinner. Photo of my sons breakfast is insane. Wet burrito, chicken mole, and flat iron steak are all excellent."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh dinner. Our server was Mariah and she was the best. A great dinner was was even better with her taking care of us. She recommended the beef medallions and  was spot on. We don't live close but we will come back if ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Amazing service, food comes out within minutes of placing your order (depending on the number of people in your party) food is amazing, and the waiters and waitresses are some of the best ever!!!"}
{"text":"Food lacked flavor. Service was adequate. Its unfortunate it wasn't better because the atmosphere was really cool."}
{"text":"Really great experience! Was nervous about the service based on some of the Father's Day reviews, but they definitely got their act together. Our service was excellent. We started with the Alma Oysters, which were wonderful. Our party of four had the scallops, salmon, fried chicken breasts and mahi mahi. Everything was cooked very well, the mahi was a tad dry, but a good taste.

Can't wait to try breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Great food .... the park chop was fantastic 
Nice outside area and a fun bar 
Ask for Eric he too great care of us !"}
{"text":"Meh.  Underwhelming.  Atmosphere nice, great outdoor patio.  Kitchen was slow, food good but not hot.  $35 for breakfast for two and 1 ice tea.  For that kind of $ it should have been awesome.  They started feeding one woman at the bar celery and olives because her food was taking so long! Too bad, this area needs a great place.  Try Richardson's or even AJ's BBQ instead on a weekend."}
{"text":"There are wonderful restaurants we all encounter when we travel. Then there are those which truly have soul and become part of your lasting memory of your trip. Alma is such a place.  From the understated yet very distinct and transporting decor to every morsel of the food, our experience here was special. Eric and the rest of the staff welcomed us as if we were old friends from the first visit. And that visit for dinner turned into several more  during a one week stay in the the area. Not to be missed: the pancakes, various chiles which were uber-authentic, porkchops, scallops and beautifully crafted drinks. But as you should know, it's not about any individual dish. The true quality of a restaurant lies in the details. All of them. And these guys get it right everytime. Do yourself a favor and pay them a visit"}
{"text":"Place did NOT disappoint! Can't wait to go back and enjoy more delicious food, libations and staff (thank you Erick & Emily)!"}
{"text":"The food and service is just awesome. It has become our new neighborhood place. Try the mahi mahi, the pork chop and of course the incredible fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing Valentine's Day dinner at Alma.  Our server, Eric was amazing!!  The food was outstanding and the atmosphere on the patio was wonderful."}
{"text":"Used to be Downside Risk restaurant most recently- nicely redone and great patio.  Food was super creative and good service.  Only reason for
4 vs 5 stars is the food was almost too creative and odd to eat.  Would go back!"}
{"text":"First meal in Scottsdale. We made a great decision to eat here. The restaurant and service was really good. The food was delicious. Everything was made from scratch. The owner/executive chef even came out to ask my daughter what kind of pasta she likes. She made her a special chicken pasta in cream sauce. My wife and I ended up eating some of it. We'll definitely try to come back here before going back home to Cali."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Stumbled into this place while looking for breakfast. Tamales and chilaquiles were fantastic. It's a place that is easy to be a regular. Service was awesome too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch - had the Green Chile and it was fantastic!  Great service and ambiance also.  Probably one of the top 3 places we ate at during our Trip."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and the food is great. Have had the Chipolle Chile (very spicy) but really good. Green Pork Chili is way less hot but still a good amount of spice and even a really good Cobb salad. The only thing I don't rank as great is service. Wait staff is nice but very inattentive. Not saying it for one time but all 3 times. So, come with time and patience."}
{"text":"They have a convenient location, great atmosphere and nice menu selections.  The food had good flavors and presentation, it took a bit longer than other restaurants for the meal, but it was worth it.  If you're a Type \"A\" person, you probably won't like reading their menu with the spelling and grammatical errors, but the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try Alma out for the first time tonight. There was a nice mixed crowd and a band that wasn't too loud that played a variety of music. Even had me moving to the music a bit. The service and food were a perfect 10! Or in this case, 5 stars! Everyone, the hostess, our server and the two bussers were all so nice, very attentive and all asked how everything was. If I had room for more, I would have ordered another round of the Shrimp and Grits and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken again. Big thanks to our server, Alex for the awesome recommendations! We will be back but it's going to be hard to order anything else off the menu!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  Large portions,  great flavors,  and outstanding service.  Eric was great.  Definately a place to put on the regular rotation."}
{"text":"I am a chilaquiles nut and in a week I tried as many as I could in Scottsdale -- this was the best. Chips stayed crunchy, great chunks of pork and an awesome sauce.  Breakfast overall was fantastic and the place is very kid-friendly with awesome kids menu that has real food and good prices."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was fantastic. Four chunks of breast meat with perfect seasoning and crisp covered in meaty gravy."}
{"text":"Just went one time and ate at the bar. Food was ok, not great (it was from happy hour menu but don't remember what it was). The service was fine but not very personable. I may try it again and will update if I do."}
{"text":"Had dinner on a Friday night.  Reservation was seated as soon as we arrived.  Service was very good for the entire meal.  Atmosphere was lively, but conversations did not require shouting. Cocktails were interesting twists on traditional favorites.  My wife had the Christmas enchiladas.  Wow. Both the red and green were flavorful and perfectly prepared.  She also had the spinach, bacon and egg salad and loved the bacon vinegarette.  I had the steak frites.  Mistake!!!  Both the steak and fries tasted frozen and dry.  Never again.  We shared a key lime pie which was a wonderful finish to the meal."}
{"text":"Ok. My main criteria is food and it's consistency.  I have been here twice for overpriced and under delivered in taste and value appetizers. Nothing makes me want to go back to try dinner if they cannot even get appetizer right. I wish I had an authentic street food instead of glorified overpriced tasteless tacos. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Came for brunch and everything was delicious! Reasonable prices, lots of choices and good service."}
{"text":"Excellent new place in Gainey Marketplace!  Went there for my birthday dinner!  Decided to try something new and I wasn't disappointed!  Everything was fantastic!  The food was delicious (had the Salmon), the service was excellent and they even had music playing and he was fantastic!  Loved everything about it!  Eric was an excellent server, very friendly and helpful!  I loved this place!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place, and the food was very good. Our server Mauricio made some great menu recommendations. We had the shrimp and the Brie appetizers. Both amazing. We also had the Alma salad, similar to a wedge and the crispy cauliflower. Again, both very good. For the entree we had the pork chops, which were delicious. 
The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because the kitchen was closing at 9:00 on a Saturday night, and with a 7:45 reservation, we felt a little rushed against the kitchen. However our server was so wonderful, and didn't make us feel uncomfortable. We just know that next time an 8:00 reservation probably won't work."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambience, and great service!  We will definitely come back! You are missing out if you do not come!"}
{"text":"What a great new addition to Gainey Ranch! A total 180 from the previous tenants, whereby the local mortuary guy was handing out business cards to the clientele...

The décor and vibe is fresh and vibrant.  (Checkout wall in back with silver and steer skull!) The service is outstanding from Mallory who welcomes you with a smile and a hello as Hostess to Christina the bartender who is like an old friend....but pours way better drinks and is better looking. 

The food is also delicious, I had their happy hour apps and the black bean soup kicks ass! Drink specials are very reasonable and a great selection of wines to choose from.  

Lastly the patio is spacious with high powered misters to keep you cool and ideal for larger groups.  

So next time you're in Gainey Ranch or looking for a new spot to check out, definitely give this place a try!  Tell em Croft sent ya!"}
{"text":"Great dinner, ambiance, service.  Seated immediately outside. Heater placed by our request.  Drinks came quickly. Margarita and rum specialty drinks were pretty strong.  House salads big and good. Cauliflower app awesome.  Scallops, fried chicken, chicken mole, and mahi mahi all very good choices. All 4 of us pleased!  Our server Eric was on the  ball. He was so busy but was right there to check on us and be friendly.  
We made reservations for Friday night only a couple of hours earlier.  Requested outside since this weather is great. We are staying at the Hyatt and walked the short way there. The concierge recommended this restaurant and we decided to go after reading the yelp reviews.  We enjoyed the outdoor seating and southwest decor. All a 5 star dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this new spot. The food is great as is the service. The red chili is amazing!! Had the overworked cowboy which is a country style fried steak with fried eggs.  Awesome!! Very comfortable laid back atmosphere. Will certainly be back."}
{"text":"We had apps and drinks in the bar early on a Friday evening. Good food, good service, liked the energy. Nice addition to the n\"hood!"}
{"text":"My family and I had a fantastic breakfast at Alma. Our server, Eric, was professional and efficient. 

There are so many variations on the menu and our meals were fresh and delicious. We'll be back soon!

 Annette"}
{"text":"Really happy to have found this restaurant.  My partner suffers with lots of allergies.  They were very accommodating.  Made a dish that she felt confident with AND that was delicious. Chef José and our server Ryan were top notch. Food was amazing. Creative dishes with lots of variety. We will be back."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here Friday. My wife and daughter love the pancakes. Melissa and Erik were very nice and professional.My wife loved Erik. I only gave one star however because we could hear the chef yelling at her staff, and she seemed pretty rude, we were a bit taken back. The ambiance and drinks were also great."}
{"text":"I love this place!! We stumbled on it several weeks ago and I can't stay away. It has quickly become my favorite brunch spot!! The service is always awesome the food is spectacular and the restaurant has great southwest decor. The outdoor area is also top notch! I recently moved from Oregon and I love bringing my guests here for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town for a conference. This place had great reviews... however the service was TERRIBLE! They were not very busy yet no server was available for at least 10 minutes until we asked. The food was mediocre. Drinks ran dry. Don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Thank you Sheila for bringing your amazing food and restaurant to Central Scottsdale!  My family visited Alma for breakfast on Sunday and we're SO glad we did.  The menu has fabulous choices (the pancakes were delicious and I'm not usually a fan) and the healthy egg white omelet was yummy!  We can't wait to return for dinner!  Don't wait in the long line for Hash Kitchen, come to the other side of Gainey and try Alma.  You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere great service. Something for everyone plus family friendly. Beautiful outdoor dining. 
I will be a regular at Alma. Loved it!"}
{"text":"amazing food, excellent atmosphere, fabulous customer service the special sea bass was fantastic !!"}
{"text":"New restaurant bt owner of the Soul Cafe.  Great food.  Comfy hip Southwest decor.  Great patio with fireplace.  Open for Breakfast,  lunch & dinner!  Delicious! !!"}
{"text":"Alma WxSW (apologies to Alfred Hitchcock who may have preferred NxNW) is one of about two hundred restaurants that sits in the Shops at Gainey Village (OK, a slight exaggeration)!  It is in a standalone building in the northeast corner (OK-I guess the southwest corner was unavailable).  While we have been multiple times for dinner, they also serve breakfast and lunch and the owners also operate Soul Cafe in North Scottsdale.

All that said, the food is fantastic.  The blackened mahi mahi was not overly spiced, but delicious on a bed of dirty rice, black beans, corn and red peppers.  The chicken mole was delicious, as well.  While the mole is of the dark variety with some chocolate flavor, it is lightly applied over the chicken which maintains its juiciness.  The Mexaloaf was tasty but just a bit on the dry side.  It was the only entree item I have had there that was less than stellar (still good though).  Once of the best dishes (on special) was Beef Stroganoff.  The meat used was top notch, not something sitting in the back of a freezer two days from its expiration.  The cuisine is Southwestern, and exceptional.  Service has been A+ on each of our visits, as well.

They also have an extensive wine and cocktail list to go with all the great food.  There is a large patio with heaters as well as two large indoor seating areas and a nice bar area.  They had live music there on two of our visits, although I am not sure if that is still the case.  There are a variety of desserts, but it is usually tough to find any room after getting through appetizers and dinner.  This place deserves a large following, and all the Fridays we have been there, the restaurant has been quite busy.  I am looking to come back on a Wednesday, when they offer their all you can eat fried chicken.  We certainly plan to be regular visitors.  Pricing is reasonable, which makes this spot all the more appealing."}
{"text":"We have been here for breakfast and enjoyed it. Our one lunch was mixed: decent food at a high price with not quite right service. 
We decided to try dinner based on our expectation of pumpkin specials.  The evening was disappointing.  My wife and a friend who wanted to try the place ordered the pumpkin soup.  It was not edible. The pumpkin taste was destroyed by the hot peppers. We told our waiter this and he said the kitchen was supposed to tone it down. Obviously the waiters recognized the problem but the kitchen didn't respond.  He took it off the bill.   My wife had the citrus salad and liked it. I had the Brussels sprouts and calimari salad. It was ok but I didn't expect deep fried calimari. It seemed as if other calimari preparations would have worked better.  Friend had chicken mole.  The chicken was good but the dish wasn't chicken mole as all of us had seen it before.  Wine was fairly priced but no bargain. Friend liked her expresso-tini. I had whiskey and found it interesting that the only ice we saw was in that glass and there was a lot. I am not sure how much whiskey I got but the taste was good and the quantity limited.  (Drinking water is served without ice.)
Service remains uncertain. Waiters are always pleasant and often scarce.  We had to ask our soup server for our waiter since we hadn't seen him lately. 
We were disappointed tonight, particularly as our visiting friend had more food issues than we did. 
Time passes so there may be improvement. In the meantime,  breakfast is your best chance for a good meal...in my opinion."}
{"text":"The ambiance and service is great. The food was not good. I ordered the butternut squash enchiladas and I thought it was okay. I had to ask for salt for my rice which is completely unacceptable for rice at a restraunt. I understand the need to salt a piece of meat because the variance of preference is greater but not for rice. Two of my friends had to salt their rice also. Another friend ordered the pork chops and they were dry and overdone. Looks like the kitchen needs to get a handle on their finishing of food. If they can do that the restraunt will be great."}
{"text":"Wooooo the food was excelent! The size of the dishes is ginormous!  You have to try the pancake lemon ricotta,  is amazing !! I love the place and for sure I'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"We looked up reviews and discovered this place.  We were very pleased with the atmosphere, food and service!  Would definitely recommend it.  All three of us loved our meals (lemon tilapia, salmon tacos and beef medallions), and the homemade pie was delicious!"}
{"text":"will not do the breakfast $6.99 special again, very slow service, and make up the \"bargain\" with $3.00 coffee.  so the $6.99 special with tax and tip turned out to be $15.00"}
{"text":"Ok, I've been here 4 times in as many days and for good reason... the food is exquisite. While the portions on some plates may seem a little smaller than the average pork palace (I'm not talking about the all you can eat buttermilk chicken for only $14 on Wednesdays.. killer btw) they are more appropriate given the obesity rates we have in this country.. of course you'll wish there was more on your plate because the food is so delicious, but just have a few drinks from their ample bar and call it a day. The ambience is just right for the 35 and older crowd.. they have a great band playing on Wednesday nights.. I almost hate to write this because I don't want a bunch of goons crowding my new favorite hangout but they deserve the accolades.. compliments to the chef! I had the tamales tonight.. only $10 and unrivaled."}
{"text":"We stopped in for happy hour at roughly 4:30 pm on a weekday. We sat in the left corner of the bar and had very good service.

The Mediterranean plate lacked flavor however. The tzaziki, the feta and olives were the best thing on it. All three sauces the tzaziki, the baba ghanouj and hummus all needed salt and the last two needed more garlic and just more flavor. They also brought one tiny pita cut into eight pieces for a huge plate of spreads. We ordered another pita right away and then it was barely enough for the amount of spreads.

The pork belly tacos we had not noticed were served in lettuce cup shells. It was a nice way to keep the carbs down and the sweet chili sauce had a nice heat level and the pork belly was well seasoned and crispy.

Nothing on the dinner menu caught our attention so we left after one round of drinks and the two apps.

Not sure we will return. It was OK, but there are so many other good restaurants around we are not sure the experience will bring us back."}
{"text":"Place was great. Made even better by our waiter Eric. His warm engaging manner was wonderful. Enjoyed talking with him as much as we enjoyed the food, which by the way was awesome. The entire staff was friendly. Would go back and recommend highly"}
{"text":"Wife and I are on vacation and decided on this place because of the reviews and the menu. Started out great, the hostess was friendly, greeted us with a smile, and sat us right away. Then everything went downhill. Of note, the restaurant was nearly empty. We waited more than 10 minutes before anyone bothered to come over. Long story short, our waitress was inattentive and really treated us like a side note. Food took about 30 minutes to come out and was \"ok\".  For the price and implied quality, we were both disappointed."}
{"text":"I was in a grand search of fine cuisine for my Valentine's Day celebration with the lovely lady.  We packed this day so full with a race and a little bit of rained out Devil's baseball.  Went for a late reservation that was about as perfect as you can get.  Still have no idea who Alma is...actually I do, the prophet that the road in East Valley is named after etc.  

To start we had Brie and Bacon jam, which was extremely delicious, although we needed a second helping of bread that also came with a flat pate of butter, at an extra $3 charge. (Worth it)  Although it is truly impossible to find Mahi in our desert, they had a blackened Mahi on the menu, I almost went for the Salmon seasonal, but I chose to go with the lamb shank and it was wonderful with a pumpkin risotto, which to be honest you sort of lost the flavoring after awhile.  But like Tommy Vs in Old Town the price you pay gets you a ton of food full of flavor.

Our Waitress was awesome, she definitely laid out the specials and her favorite drinks.  I thought Mango Marg's presentation was excellent with candied mango and then you add strong Monsoon.  The desert options just really made me mad, because the pies are a normal thing, she had me at Blueberry, but there were no blueberry pies left.  I must come back for the pie, we had the whiskey pecan cake and it was, it was the pleasure to cleanse our palettes into the night."}
{"text":"Chef Sheila made an amazing appetizer of jalapeño bacon wrapped shrimp.  Then an incredible potato cake topped with blackened Mahi Mahi with roe.

The pork chop was tender.  I'm not sure what she does with the buttermilk chicken, but OMG!!!!!  The Mahi Mahi tacos are wonderful.  A fit for foodies.

The wine list is extensive with great selections.  We had a corporate event here and the service was the BEST!

Be sure to stop and say hi to Danielle, a fun bartender with lots to say.

The outside patio with fireplaces was cool and made a very exquisite event for our guests.

My friend said the breakfast is amazing and to try the blueberry pancakes for breakfast.  Going back to try those."}
{"text":"What a find!!! Just had the overworked cowboy. Country fried steak with country gravy and New Mexican green chile sauce. The green chile sauce was amazing. This was such a great find. Oh yeah, the jalapeño bacon was awesome"}
{"text":"Today we had the pleasure of meeting Ashley a very pleasant and confident server.  This restaurant is a subsidiary of soul Café is every bit as good if not better. I know this because I eat at soul cafe often.  Try it you'll like it it."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch this weekend after hearing rave reviews (and trying to stop in before for lunch on Monday when it was closed).  I ordered the ranch sandwich with sweet potato fries at the suggestion of our server.  I was completely pleased with my selection and really enjoyed the sandwich and fries.  Great service and really great atmosphere as well!  I'll definitely be back in cooler weather to enjoy that great patio.  I'll stop in next time for the weekend brunch...I hear it is amazing too!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch with my wife for a first time visit. Arrived 15 minutes b4 my wife yet, because there were open tables, they sat me right away. Nice! Some places I have been would not do this. Since I don't like really spicy chorizo our server Val brought me a sample
 I found it to be a little too spicy so ordered the Mediterranean Omelet with spinach and feta cheese. Very flavorful. My wife had the Dr. Suess  which was also full of flavor. My wife especially liked her pot of hot tea. Overall it was a very nice dinning experience with great service and food. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"Incredible pork medallions special! Great service. Unfortunately the debate was on all the TV sets and almost lost my appetite! Lol

Quiet, cozy place and fantastic service. A bit pricey but typical for the area."}
{"text":"Bartender staff and food wonderful. Ambience very nice outdoor seating and or bar. It was great"}
{"text":"This chef-owner restaurant was recommended by the bellman at my hotel...it was one of the best recommendations! The chilaquiles were SO delicious and the jalapeno bacon is ridiculous! The staff was so friendly and accommodating, especially my bartender Emily and server Eric! I wanted to order one of everything!!"}
{"text":"Just finished breakfast. The choices are amazing. Service by Dominique outstanding. She was very attentive and knowledgeable"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place the dinner menu is awesome along with the atmosphere and decor .. 5 stars for dinner SKIP THE BREAKFAST! DINNER MENU IS EXCELLENT Love the chicken, pork chop fish and other specials. 
Bfast....Omelettes are flat, don't order the ham pinto beans w eggs u will be disappointed.... They don't offer a hash brown alternative to roasted potatoes which are too heavy for breakfast! TWO STARS REFLECT BREAKFAST ONLY! 
The dinner menu and the overall service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!  We had the pork chop with sweet potato pie and AZ Medallions, both were delicious. Waiter was good, place was designed well with a nice bar and patio."}
{"text":"The restaurant atmosphere is really nice. The food is ok. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos and while they gave me a decent amount of fish, there was hardly any flavor. I was expecting some spice as it is a Southwest restaurant. The portion size consistency needs work. Some of my friends plates had tons of food on them while other entree items were super small."}
{"text":"Well, I was surprised that our after-game local had disappeared but am not sad since Alma wxsw has popped up in its place. Yesterday morning we had breakfast on their dog friendly outdoor patio and we were not disappointed. Valerie, our server, was friendly, knowledgable about the menu and on her game. Justin, another helper, served us with a friendly smile and conversation. They were both intent on making sure our needs were met. 

My husband had been here a few days ago and raved about the green chile. We had a vegan friend with us and his needs were met! Given that it was the weekend, I started with a Hangover Helper. This is Alma's version of a bloody mary and I love the spiced rim. It was a great drink. My husband stuck with the Fresh Squeezed IPA - he's an IPA loyalist.

I can't remember the name of my breakfast dish but I went for the Southwest side of the menu. My plate had three corn tortilla cups filled with scrambled eggs and each one topped with something different; red chile, green chile, and spicy ranch beans. I honestly did not need to eat again for the entire day. DH got the tamale plate and raved about it. 

Next time I will walk since I'll need to burn it off but I will go back - soon."}
{"text":"Okay. What to say here other than DISAPPOINTING!! We live nearby and went for breakfast one day and were thrilled with food and service. Went back soon after for dinner with friends. Had a good experience all around with good food-except for the soggy vegetable medley . None of us could eat it and we all are veggie lovers. Seemed reasonable for the 4 of us and did not notice extra charges.  So went tonight with hubby after getting the email about $12.99 all you can eat chicken. Now for tonight's experience...ordered drinks which were supposed to be $2 off - didn't happen when the bill came.  Ordered one salad, shrimp appetizer, chicken to share. No pepper offered for salad-had to ask and waited through half the salad. Asked for bread-came with oil and vinegar. Charge-$3. Asked why the charge and manager said it comes with some dinners. WTF. Guess our meal didn't warrant bread let alone butter. Then the chicken was charged full price with charge for extra plate split. Okay. Server said it was a \"secret \" email price and you had to mention it. Duh me bad. Bottom line here - there are too many good restaurants in this town with better service and not nickel and diming guests.  Sorry this neighborhood place is off our list and we won't be recommending to our neighbors and friends. The manager came to our table and reduced the check and made several apologies. Sorry but that didn't change our opinion of the place. Avoid it."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to Father's Day brunch as Soul Cafe has always been a go to spot for great food.

Our experience started poorly. They had lost our reservation that had been made 3 days prior. Thankfully they had a table to accommodate our group.
From there we were treated to a poorly run debacle which included slow drink refills, food that took over 1:15 minutes to come, incorrect orders and total confusion. 

After about an hour of waiting one of our group members was told that the dish she had ordered was no longer available. It took an hour for them to figure this out?!? 

It took nearly 20 minutes from the time the first dish came out until we all had our food. There were only 5 of us. When all 5 dishes had come, 3 of the 5 were not what had been ordered.  It also took them that long to get us place settings. Seriously? No napkins and silver wear for almost 1.5 hours after we had been sitting?

Upsides, the servers and manager were super nice about everything. After watching them apologize to nearly every other table for similar issues they were obviously flustered but treated us well. Also, the food was great! Right on par with Soul Cafe which is always excellent.

Needless to say it will be a long time before I try this place again. Our first try was a very, very crummy experience and I have totally lost faith in this place. I hope they get it together soon because if this keeps up doors will be closed in no time."}
{"text":"We went early on a Sunday morning.  Great food, great service.  I did not partake in the Mimosa Tray, but will go back as it looked amazing.  Lemon Ricotta pancakes as big as a platter and TASTY!!"}
{"text":"Great for groups! We went with 16 for Sunday brunch. Awesome service, great food (everyone loved what they ordered), perfect back area for our group. Our server did a great job, food was surprisingly quick and loved the mimosa tray! Will definitely be back for bloody Mary's and eggs Benedict! Patio also looks great for sunset and a fire."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! My husband had been here 3 times before and finally brought me and OMG it is the best! I ate it all, best pancake ever! Eric was awesome, recommended everything and it was perfect! He was so attentive. Can't wait to come back and see what he recommends next."}
{"text":"Loved finding a SxSW restaurant in the Valley. I've spent many business trips to Dallas and Austin enjoying this great type of cuisine. ALMA didn't disappoint. Great menu, great service and a nice environment. Love the Arizona medallions, the short rib ravioli and the salmon tostadas. Drinks are great - pricey but a strong pour. Only wish the dessert menu was stronger."}
{"text":"This is definitely an interesting restaurant.  The atmosphere is fantastic.  The menu is unique and creative.  There are several things I would like to go back and try.  We had the fried green tomato caprese to start, which was delicious,  as was my husband's Mexaloaf.  But the Arizona Medallions that I ordered were underwhelming.  The jalapeño cheese sauce had little flavor.  And our server was slow.  Very friendly and nice,  but slow.  We will definitely give it another try,  as there is a lot of potential, but tonight it fell short of a higher rating.  I'm hoping to return and be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal and service at Alma last week.  The food was delicious but Eric, our server, made our experience superb!   Eric was friendly, passionate, and welcoming to our group.  His recommendations were spot on and the food spoke for itself.   Leave room for pie!"}
{"text":"BF was visiting me from out of state and after going on yelp we decided to visit Alma. I'd just like to say that this food was literally the best meal I've had since I've moved to AZ. everything was seasoned perfectly, and true love was put into the meal. Def would go to this place again and try everything else on the menu. The food almost made us tear in happiness. If you are doubting this place, don't."}
{"text":"Excellent quality food with great service. Great patio, little hard to fine but highly recommend trying it. If u want ear outside, great atmosphere, great service & excellent American food.... found the place"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Get the cauliflower and pork belly tacos as appetizers.  Not crowded"}
{"text":"We had a bday dinner of 18 there last night. We had made reservations prior. We were seated on the patio by a fireplace. Our waitress was Joann. I had looked at their menu earlier in the day, so I knew what I wanted to order. EEEEEECK not 1, but BOTH items I wanted (short rib ravioli & beet salad) were not available bc they were out. Yep! Out! Well that threw a total wrench in my dining experience there. So I asked the waitress what her favorite dishes were. She said the diver scallops, the tenderloin & something else. So I went with her suggestion & ordered the diver scallops. Others at my table ordered the salmon dish, pumpkin ravioli & medallions. Our apps arrived shortly after our order was taken. We had the pretzel nubs, Brie, & crispy cauliflower. For a drink I ordered their Alma Sangria. Our waitress was very nice & tentative. Unfortunately, my scallop dish arrived way earlier then the rest of the tables food (hence my pic) So it sat there waiting....& waiting....& waiting. Finally the other dishes started to arrive. The scallops themselves were completely overcooked. I ate 1/2 of one, gave 2 away & left one on my plate. Others agreed they were not prepared properly & were tasteless. As for the sautéed spinach & green apple bed they came on, that was delicious. Wish I had more of that. I tried a bite of the salmon & rice dish & that was tasty. One of my friends ordered some curry couscous dish & had to send it back bc it was way to spicy. She ended up reordering & ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos. She said the fish was over cooked & dry. On to desert. They ordered the bananas fosters & chocolate cake. I passed on both. 
I was not impressed with this place, for the price you pay. Most main dishes are over $20 & my Sangria was $11. I may give this spot another chance, bc I really wanted to try the short rib ravioli & beet salad."}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say.  We went here on a whim for lunch one day with a group from work and what a pleasant surprise!  The service and the food were all amazing!  The buttermilk fried chicken salad and barbacoa were out of this world.  Today we went again to try the breakfast.  Oh my, it may have been even better than lunch!  The Tres Locos with eggs over medium were out of this world.  The perfect blend of flavors.  I immediately asked for hot sauce at which Eric told me I did not need it to enjoy the perfect blend of flavors.  Was he right!  This was by FAR the best breakfast I have had in ages.  My friend ordered the Crazy Biscuits and loved every bite.  Eric then talked us into a lemon pancake for dessert.  I do not eat pancakes, I find them to be too heavy.  Oh my, this was the most AMAZING pancake I've ever tasted in my life.  I will be dreaming about that lemon fluffy goodness for a while!  Do yourself a favor, try this place.  Let Eric help you with what to order.  You will not be let down!"}
{"text":"This was one of the most unexpected wonderful dining experiences ever.  Here is the deal: we are vegan, here visiting our son and needed food. We can normally find a vegan meal Mexican as long as the beans don't have meat in the beans.  So I called to ask--the effort the staff put into making us feel comfortable was amazing. The executive chef, Jose Morales, took time to get on the phone to accommodate our diet. When we arrived our waiter Alex was amazing. We had fried cauliflower, kale salad, and special fried avocado tacos. Our son had the pork chop with bacon jam.  These dishes where prepared with \"magic\" as one other server described. We couldn't agree more.  If in Phoenix, don't miss the chance to dine here!"}
{"text":"Bit off of a dinner spot with some hits and misses. 3.5 stars 

Food: 3.5, Service: 3, Atmosphere: 3
Cost to worth it rating: 2 (pretty spendy for variable quality, most entrees mid to high $20s)
Opentableable: yes, kid's menu: yes
Return worthiness: probably not

Highlights:
- Pork chop: cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly. Accompanied by this large mashed sweet potato in a puff pastry which was stellar as well. 4.5 stars
- Clams: good amount with a lovely broth and small strips of bacon. 4 stars
- Pretzel bites: puffy nubbins which tasted almost donutty. 3.5 stars 
- Patio lounge: looked cool to sit back and have a drink.

Midlights: 
- Jalapeno margarita: I've had several of these other places yet this one was overly spicy. Could see the seeds floating in the glass and I got to numb lip status drinking it.
- Entertainment: had a guitar singer duo who were great and playing a variety of tunes, but just didn't seem to mesh with the dinner vibe. 

Lowlights:
- Steak frites type entree: very sad small portion of 4 slices of steak on the top of a bunch of fries. Devoid of flavor too and one of the more expensive dishes on the menu. 2 stars.
- Service: Seemed super thrown off by a large party in back on a Friday night. Wanted to push our reservation up a half hour and they said they could not. We got there on time with the restaurant mostly empty and even then took a bit to get our table organized and longer to get our food.

Glad some of the good items were good but since there are so many places in the area, I'll probably try some others when I visit next."}
{"text":"The staff here is the BEST Danielle went out of here way to make me feel right at home soooo welcoming and friendly  Big Shout out to Sully the Br back did an exceptional job staying on top of my needs 
THIS PLACE ROCKS  Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"Green Chili was awesome!!! Great atmosphere, and Eric was so hospitable.  All the dishes had incredible flavor and I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Like several reviewers, here, before me, have stated:  It's a shame that \"no star\" ratings can't be given. Had I that option I would have levied it for this chicken**** joint. 

If you go here, prepare to be nickel and dimed at your every turn. (I would've gone to the restroom, here, but feared they'd want exact change to use it.).

The beau and I dined here this evening based on an email blast from the joint. Of interest was their $12.99 all-u-can-eat buttermilk fried chicken dinner special. It was \"speshul,\" alright. 

Everything on the plate was flavorless.  The cook needs to come to the reality that if she's going to prepare Southern food, then she needs to recognize the existence two basic ingredients:  salt and pepper.  The crust on the chicken -- if it could be called that -- was soggy and sallow. The gravy rivaled Elmer's paste and covered the chicken, not the lifeless mashed potatoes. You don't smother fried chicken in gravy. Course as terrible as the chicken was, well... .  Too, if you're serving Southern-style chicken -- offer the dark meat pieces of da bird. Not breasts only. Offering just the breasts is turning the dish into prissy fried food for pretty, little skinny-legged pants-ed  people. If the cook wants to serve health food then Suthin' cookin' ain't it.  Too, dark meat costs less, and that helps the bottom line. 

The topper to this half of the review was after receiving an additional serving of chicken, the gravy and mashed potatoes were MIA.  Turns out, the sides are not AYCE.  What's more the chicken was served on a salad plate. I felt like I had just taken receipt of a child's plate. And without the gravy -- and plated against a green background -- the chicken's true color -- again, sallow -- stood out like a diamond in a goat's patootie.

The beau had Clams Alma (or a description to that effect). They were good I have to admit.  The broth tasty and with great sop appeal. The downer, Debbie?  The beau asked for more bread and was told that three more, thin, skimpy, half slices of mediocrity would be $3.00 extra.  And from the tone of the waitron's voice, we could tell the kitchen's Bread Nazi had laid down the law:  \"No extra bread as vee haf vays of dealink vith such requestors.\"

Upshot?  If you like unpublished rules and enjoy being nickel-and-dimed, then this joint is your kinda place.  Me?  I'm sticking with joints that have salt and pepper on the cookline."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for happy hour to check them out.  They've done a nice remodel and I sat at the bar.

Josh the bartender was more interested in talking with the regulars than working but Christina was friendly and provided great service.

I had a Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA and the bacon wrapped shrimp.  The shrimp appetizer was pretty good but a little overpriced for happy hour at $12.

This is an OK place if you're in the neighborhood, but certainly not a destination dining experience."}
{"text":"Once we were graced with a server thongs were looking up. Food took forever and we ordered apps. That all said, food was excellent."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it!    Had the green chili pork entree recommendation and it was exceptional!
I'd recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"We have tried Alma four times now and keep hoping the last experience was just an \"off\" day for the restaurant.  Our server, Madison, was great and tried hard to accommodate us but the food was just average.  We ordered some green chili with the chips and salsa.  The last time we were there the green chili was thick and delicious.  This time, the green chili was like water and you couldn't even get it to stick to the chips.  The bartender struggled making an old fashioned.  Had to have her make it twice and it still wasn't right but we suffered through it anyhow.  Seems like the staff just doesn't understand what a sense of urgency is when someone sits down in their restaurant.  Takes way too long to get a drink.  Hate to say it but adios Alma.  You just lost a couple more locals.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The breakfast is absolutely delicious! All flavors of the pancakes they offer are superb. Eric will take excellent care of you! He knows the menu very well and can give you suggestions for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Met our daughter for Sunday breakfast that was killer! Love the staff and the food left us speechless. I had eggs, chicken sausage and it came with two pancakes ( I had 1 apple cinnamon and 1 buttermilk)(my daughter had blueberry and chocolate chip)  it's  plenty to share! And the food was so good we went went back 2 days later for a business lunch. At that point I had the skinny Mexican salad which was so good had just a little spice in the dressing. My husband had the chicken posole in both visits so you know it was good! I highly recommend and will be back this weekend!"}
{"text":"Nice imaginative food. Great staff, and wonderful patio."}
{"text":"Biggest, most delicious pancakes EVER! The atmosphere is clean, quaint, warm, welcoming and chef Sheila knocks it out of the park with her amazing SW flavors. Highly recommend the chilaquiles and the lemon ricotta pancakes. I also was pleasantly surprised that they had flavored creamer for my coffee.  Eric was our server and he made great suggestions and took care of us with his flawless service. Food was delivered super fast and hot. We didn't need to eat lunch and were full until dinner. Love this place and can't wait to go back with family."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Would recommend this place over and over again. Came in for lunch, which was pretty slow but a good slow. Service was superb, we didn't know which items on the menu were the spiciest (we can tolerate some pretty good heat), so the waitress that was there brought us out some samples of the chilis making our choice easier and the experience much more personal. Then we each  got $10 gift cards for next time we go. Which there will be a next time because this place is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! A1 on my list of places to eat."}
{"text":"We were headed to HASH for breakfast on Saturday 3/18, when we pulled into the parking lot there was a line of people waiting outside. So we went to the other side of the complex to Alma. No line. In fact there were only three tables occupied and a few people sitting at the bar. This should have been our first clue! My husband ordered eggs over easy and crispy bacon. The eggs arrive with crispy edges all around and the yolks were as hard as a hockey puck. Seriously, not kidding! And the bacon was chewy not crispy. My chicken and toast (French Toast) was a humongous serving, it could have fed three people. But it was definitely quantity over quality. The French toast was very mushy and the chicken was \"meh\". The saving grace was the service, prompt, and very pleasant. But lesson learned...we should have just waited in line at Hash. We only visit once a year during Bball spring training and it was disappointing to have waisted a breakfast morning at Alma."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast because we were looking for something new. Surprisingly, there was barely anyone in the restaurant on a Sunday morning. The service was okay, not exceptional.

Hubby and I decided to share the chilaquiles and eggs and a lemon ricotta pancake. The pancake are was good, big and good for two people. I loved the chilaquiles! They use corn tortilla chips as opposed to the soft tortillas which I love! I love the crunch! They topped with green chile pork and other goodness. We ate the whole thing and ate most of the pancake. 

Close to the end of our meal, our server went missing for awhile so we had to wait for her to drop our check. Overall, great food and great value."}
{"text":"Peg and I have made it a point to skip restaurant week because of the crowds and feelings of empathy for the chefs. No doubt it is a way to try new things, and some of our fav restaurants have been the results of restaurants weeks in the past...when it really was a week...not a bakers's dozen week.  Anywoo...We took some friends to Chef Sheila's newest place (she of Heart and Soul  and Soul Cafe fame) and I was just blown away with the quality of the food. This isn't to say that I was surprised that the food is good...it always has been good at her other places. In addition to savory, Sheila is a wonderful baker.  This meal for all of us was incredibly tasty and the service was excellent. The old Downside Risk space is very well appointed and the bar scene is very active. John Auer is the FOH presence and he is very good at his job.   I hope that when you are in the mood for something a bit different, that you consider this neighborhood gem for breakfast , lunch or dinner....or dessert!   Dr. B"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Dessert is to die for. We had the Buffalo burger, Mahi tacos and Strawberry salad. For dessert the Blueberry pie was awesome, perfect for sharing. A happy accidental dinner outing."}
{"text":"Stopped by here while waiting to meet a friend. I wanted to check it out. Ordered the mango margarita and asked the bartender to makse it spicy, however, didn't work ugh...jalapeño seeds but no real spice in my drink. I appreciated him trying. Maybe they should consider as supposed to be a little \"spicy\" lol
Ordered the pork belly, lettuce, tacos. The pork was great, however there was not any care to make sure lettuce was shells/cups. Meat was just placed a top lettuce clumps. It had slivers of peppers but could have benefited from some sort of sauce or slaw or salsa. 
Staff was so very nice and obliging. I'll maybe, be back for a glass of wine, but not specialty cocktail or food."}
{"text":"We live in North Scottsdale and were always a big fan of Soul Café.  It was great to see Chef Sheila open a new restaurant closer to work.  The restaurant is open and airy - but still has a sense of warmth.  There was quite a large lunch crowd, but the service was good - unusual for a new opening.  Had the Skinny Mexican Salad which was wonderful.  The table also had the Green Pork Chile and the Salmon sandwich.  Everyone said the food was great and we would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow.  Great place!  So relieved we have another option at Gainey Ranch.  Our waiter Eric was fantastic.  Menu eclectic enough for four very particular guests.  Try splitting a couple of entrees, a great way to enjoy a bit more in one visit.  Very accommodating with split plates and special requests.  Chef a genius in combinations of tastes, texture and temperature.  Primo!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast at Alma!!! Wow.  Great service by Eric Ramirez, quick coffee and juice.  Then to an incredibly wide menu.  Touch to settle on choices, but we had the Tres Locos (generously-sized corn tortilla cups with scrambled eggs and three separate toppings: beans, green chili and red chili). I'll get. That again once I finished cycling through the other things I want to try. Lemon ricotta pancake is to die for - seriously. The appleisous pancake (apple and cinnamon) also terrific.  But order just the single pancake (only $6.00!) as each pancake is ENORMOUS!  (Neighboring tables had healthy-looking Bloody Marys, but I'm not a fan of cold tomato juice.) If you like breakfast or brunch this is the place."}
{"text":"Met some friends for brunch this morning at The Alma.  Food was delicious but the service was the best.  Madison was attentive, friendly and funny.  Will bring my husband next time and will ask for Madison."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i found this place on Yelp and absolutely love it I'm originally from San Diego where there's brunch spots EVERYWHERE and I mean BRUNCH not just breakfast we've come to realize that Scottsdale doesn't have many brunch places more just breakfast so this was definitely a great find for us!! They're brunch is great I absolutely loved their French toast and chicken tenders dish the breading on the chicken is delicious and so is the jalapeño syrup that goes on it (I know it sounds different) but I highly recommend! We've been here twice now and is a place we like to bring our out of town guests too since it has great service, food and Bloody Mary's!"}
{"text":"Very yummy..order the wedge salad,loaded fries, pork wings, jalapeno bacon shrimp, pretzels...all on happy hour.
The wines awesome , 805 beer and mules

Great location..."}
{"text":"We visited Alma for breakfast for the second time this week; having a rather negative experience a week ago.  Last week the orders were all mixed up with the wrong sides with the breakfasts and took a while to straighten it all out.  Because the restaurant is new to the area we wanted to give it another chance.  We are very experienced at eating breakfast in Scottsdale restaurants and I will have to say that the food is, at best, mediocre and the most expensive breakfast we've had in Scottsdale.  The chef needs to pay a visit to Butters or Butterfields and see what a fluffy, high quality omelette looks and tastes like.  If you're going to charge the highest price in Scottsdale, the portion size and quality should exceed expectations as well.  The manager was obnoxious and just wouldn't leave the table; annoying the serverand ys as well.  He was trying to upsell us and we knew exactly what we wanted.  They serve one piece of toast with the breakfast and charge extra if you want a second piece.  The Soul Café is more successful in it's location because there are not as many restaurants to choose from.  We were very disappointed when we compared it to other Scottsdale choices and will not return."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast, and the place was pretty empty since it was a weekday and we were having a bit of a late breakfast. We were sat immediately by a nice hostess and our waiter, Eric came up very quickly and was EXCELLENT! He gave us awesome recommendations and really knew the menu. He understood when one person in our party had a food allergy and was able to make great recommendations based on the allergy. He had a great sense of humor and spent some time hanging out and just talking with us after our meal. I would come back just for a waiter like Eric.

As for the food, WOW. Huge portions of great food!!! The food came out in a very timely manner, so we weren't waiting long at all. I got the chilaquiles, and they were awesome. Two other people got dishes with the green chili, and we all agreed that it was some of the best we've had. As for the pancakes, they were massive, perfectly fluffy, and really hit the spot!

We will definitely come back the next time we are in town!!!"}
{"text":"You HAVE to try the lemon ricotta pancake here...fabulous!  But, the don't tell you how humongous they are & 2 come per order, so get just one!"}
{"text":"Great place. Healthy options and great live music. Service was on point and the apple pie desert was awesome"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the neighborhood.  I used to go way out of my way to the sister restaurant, Soul Cafe, in North Scottsdale just to have their green chili burro for breakfast - but now I don't have to.  Alma has several great menu items and some of the biggest pancakes that I've ever seen.  Plus, they've got a great selection of beers on draft (I highly recommend the Deschutes Freshly Squeezed for any IPA lovers - great accompaniment to green chili!).  Better yet, they have Happy Days... not just happy hour... 7 AM to 6:00 PM, which means 16 ounces of pure deliciousness for only $4.00 a glass.  The service, especially Veronica and Justin, is attentive and very friendly.  The owner clearly takes pride in her establishment and makes a point to visit with the customers as she is able.  I'll be back often."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 2.5/5
Happiness - 1/5

It certainly looks like I am in the minority here as the praise on Yelp is effusive and this restaurant was jam-packed during brunch. But I have noticed enough similar reviews that I suspect there is simply a habit of occasional drops in service and food-quality.

My family of three went here for brunch on Sunday. No joke, it took about 10 minutes after we were seated for the waitress to come to our table and get us water. She was honestly very nice (especially to our little son), but seemingly completely overwhelmed. It took at least another 15 minutes for my wife to get her bloody mary (to be fair, my wife LOVED it).  The decor is really nice - western themed (complete with cow patterns) and a really cool looking fire pit and outdoor area.

Almost everything we ordered either didn't meet our requests  (i.e., one dish served with pork when asked for no pork) or simply wrong (i.e., my son got one pancake instead of three). In sum. we ordered three entrees (counting one kids meal) and a biscuit on the side. After the first attempt at serving our food, only my wife had a complete meal. And somehow, the biscuit  came out after everything else! It was a bit hard to believe. As my wife pointed out, the waitress then hinted that it was our fault for asking the pork to be held on that one particular dish. Regardless of whether that is true, it simply is not something you should intimate to your customers.

The food ranged from fantastic to not that great. The biscuit, chipotle beef and the aforementioned bloody mary were fantastic. The wife and I ordered two southwesterns brunch dishes and they were both just ok. And the pancakes were huge but incredibly spongy (not sure what other adjective to use). They absolutely lacked flavor, although my son did gobble them up for whatever that is worth. 

In the end, we did receive a gift card, which was a really nice gesture (and the right gesture).  And other than that one comment, the waitress was very apologetic. Of course, I'd have preferred a bill credit as now we are obligated to return. But maybe, based on the other reviews, the next journey will surpass this one."}
{"text":"I have been going to Soul Cafe for years, I'm so happy to have a closer location with the same great taste! The Heavenly Hash is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Once my friend and I were seated, it took another 10 minutes for our server to come to us.  We were the only people sitting outside on the patio at the time, but still. Finally our server came and she felt bad, and I don't think it was even her section so kudos to her. 

Be prepared to spend a decent amount of money. I was rather shocked by how expensive things were, although I guess it's partly my fault for not checking first. I ordered the pork belly street tacos and they were the smallest things ever, and had one tiny little piece of pork belly.  Also, not very flavorful. It was one of the cheaper items so I guess that's why they were so small. The staff were friendly enough, and the decor was fun, but the food and service (AKA the most important things) were not the best."}
{"text":"Had brunch for the second time at this restaurant and was lucky enough to have the same server both times, a gentleman named Eric. The food was great; the wife enjoyed her pancakes and I had the chilequilas, which were among the best I've had anywhere. Eric has a great personality and is a terrific server. We will request his section  anytime we stop by in the future."}
{"text":"Friday night happy hour time with my lady. Very impressed with the attention to detail by all of the bartenders as they were genuine in their concern whether they exceeded our expectations. They did!

Had a delicious fish fry. Only thing that would make it better is to add another piece of fish ( 2 pieces doesn't cut it) Charge another dollar and let me walk or swim away full!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I really want to have a private event here as well.  The space is awesome and the decor is great.  The food never disappoints.  We needed another great restaurant in this area and this was a great addition.  I love there apps and the salads are awesome!  They are creative and I have loved everything I've had here so far!"}
{"text":"The brunch here was solid. The Saturday morning waiter was easy going and not taking himself too seriously which was nice.  He got our egg order wrong but it wasn't that big of a deal. My husband and I split the pick 2 pancake plate. We got the pumpkin pancake and the lemon pancake (plus it came with bacon and eggs) and everything tasted really good and splitting was definitely the right call, the pancakes were huge. I loved the pancakes, the flavors were unique and really yummy. Only reason it wasn't 5 stars was because it took so long to get our food. Not sure if it's always slow or if it was just the shadow side of the easy going waiter. If you're not in a hurry, then I'd say check it out."}
{"text":"We were very pleasantly surprised to be happily greeted by three employees as we arrived and seated (no wait at all).  It was 8am Sunday morning!  It was Arizona Breakfast Weekend so we ordered the first thing on the special menu...  Steak Oscar!  OMG.  It doesn't seem fair to review something that doesn't look like it's on the regular breakfast menu... but it was PHENOMENAL!  Two crab cakes, topped with steak, topped with poached eggs then the Hollandaise sauce.  WOW.  
    Eric was our server and holy cow, he was fantastic.  He suggested trying one of their Lemon Ricotta pancakes... OK, what the heck, I can eat one pancake.   Ha!  Not after eating the Steak Oscar... It was the size of the plate!   YUMMY YUMMY and I saved half for later.   
     Every aspect of our experience was perfect.  The music was just right, everyone there was friendly and smiling.  The food, was really delicious.  We are looking forward to going again, and bringing friends."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio.  Their bacon blueberry pancake is fantastic.  Awesome service."}
{"text":"We had a wonderfully breakfast. Spouse had apple pancake, which I helped her work on. Two large pancakes. One was breakfast the next day. The omelettes were also great, but I don't share. We will be baaaaaack!"}
{"text":"Really not impressed. We ate there for dinner last night and had some of the blandest meals I've ever had at a restaurant. Among three of us we got the chipotle flat iron, duck with blue corn waffle, and strawberry salad with added chicken. The serving sizes were pretty generous, especially of the meat portions, but none of the meat was good-- the steak, chicken or duck. All were very bland and a very weird texture- as if they'd been microwaved or something (not to say that they were, but they had that rubbery consistency). I had the duck, which our server said was the chef's specialty, and honestly the only good part of it was the small piece of waffle. The meat was just not good quality and the sauce that was with it was missing some flavor. The salad was fine, really nothing special, and the steak was bland (as were the sides that came with it). Our server was nice, but didn't seem to know the menu. I'll chalk that up to them being new, though. 

I'd like to try it for breakfast, but definitely won't be back for dinner."}
{"text":"It is so nice to finally find some great local flavor. We had a fabulous breakfast here last weekend.  We started with the raspberry granola and  apple cinnamon pancakes. Pure 100% maple syrup in cool bottles on every table made a them extra tasty. My entrée was the fit frittata with a medley of multicolored potatoes perfectly cooked. The bacon came out hot too! 
 I came back today to try their lunch menus! I had the BLT salad that was amazing! The buttermilk coating on the chicken tenders in the salad was such a savory treat!  Loved out service! Such nice people!!! We had a great time on both occasions! We will be back to try the yummy looking dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Had a bridal shower at Alma today.  They get 10 stars for great food, great service, great ambiance.  They were so great to work with.  Thank you for helping make our day so great!!"}
{"text":"We love going on For brunch on Sundays. We usually get the bacon bloodymary's. They call them \"hangover helpers\" and they are delicious (see pic)!  The \"Jumbo Wet Burrito\" is bomb (and I'm from New Mexico where breakfast burritos are everywhere and highly competitive)!  Great Bar that opens up to the outside patio and great staff that is always friendly!  We love their other place too called Soul Cafe.  The chef (and owner, I believe) do a great job with combining flavors together that's different than usual."}
{"text":"Love everything about Alma. Great for breakfast, great for dinner, and happy hour. It's a very well ran place with a cozy vibe. Highly recommend and a perfect compliment to the other great restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"We just had SUCH an amazing brunch here for Father's Day! Everyone from ages 4 to 75 years old left happy and full. You can't miss out on the jalapeño bacon and if you're gluten free you are in luck- there are even gluten free pancakes! We had great service from Eric and will be back to try out Alma for dinner soon too!"}
{"text":"I just took a friend their for lunch today for her Birthday, about 1:00pm, we were seated promptly and then had to wait for a long time for the waiter Eric Ramirez was polite enough but looked like he had too many tables to take care of. We ordered our drinks and had to wait along time before my friend got her Arnold Palmer tea that was very weak and tasteless and watered down, My friend ordered the chicken torta and I ordered the american hamburger, (buffalo burger on the receipt?) I hope it was not really a buffalo burger, anyway it was okay so we asked for a container to bring it home and as I picked up my hamburger their was a short black hair hanging out of the hamburger, I pulled it out and laid it on the plate and another waiter came and picked up our plates and I told him that their was a hair on the plate and let the chef know. Well another women waiter came to give us our check and my friend said to her that their was a hair in her food, she then went to get the manager, who came over and said \"well where is the hair?????\" and looked around and he was questioning me as if I was a liar. We told him that the young man picked up the plate and brought it to the kitchen. I am a professional women who manages a store at the Shops at Gainey Village and I will not recommend Alma to any of my customers. I do not feel you have the right staff and your manager either needs more training on correct customer relations if this is the service on a slow day,"}
{"text":"My family has been to Alma several times for Sunday breakfast.  The menu has a great variety and any customizations are happily provided.  Favorite server...Madison (Eden).  She makes you feel like family"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great staff, patio is wonderful.  Dog friendly, good drinks and atmosphere. Erik, our waiter, was super cool."}
{"text":"Not good, would not return. Although only a few tables were occupied, service was exceptionally slow. Other tables were also waiting for their food. It is noisy thanks to walls covered w metal sheets. Their large bar is 'graced' w a TV. The food was uninspired, plain and not with southwestern flavors. Staff - including the underaged, inappropriately dressed maitre'd and the waiter - seemed to be challenged by their simple tasks of finding an empty table, welcoming us and taking the order. I predict that Alma will not be there much longer, unless there are dramatic changes."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and they make a good drink but the food i had was probably some of the worst.  Pumpkin ravioli with duck confit.  The ravioli was chewy and undercooked and the pumpkin puree tasted as if it was straight from a baby food jar. Zero spices or flavor and the duck had a sweet teriyaki flavor which clashed with the whole dish and was tough like jerky and gamey tasting. We shared the dish and they took it upon themselves to split it and charge a fee which i fine if the dish would have been even decent.  We went next door and ordered more food it was that bad.  Will be back because the atmosphere was good but strictly for drinks as their appetizer selection is lacking a bit."}
{"text":"My mom and I, visiting from Houston and Austin respectively, heard about alma's through restaurant week. We came here for breakfast and Eric really outdid himself in serving us and making suggestions. We had the lemon ricotta pancake and the tres locos. Everything was delicious! The tacos were so flavorful and not too spicy. The pancake was very balanced; I'm not a huge fan of ricotta so that was great! We sat on the patio which was fairly empty and perfect weather. The street was a little noisy but not worth focusing on. Overall a great experience! We will definitely come back if we're ever in the area again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the entire Valley. This stunning restaurant has the most delicious food and beautiful atmosphere in Scottsdale. I have come to ALMA a few times now and have been won over by their top notch customer service and artistic food. Their menu has a very diverse array of amazing dishes for all meals- breakfast, lunch and dinner. Sunday brunch is my favorite time to dine in at this gem. Whether you're a lover of traditional southwestern dishes or enjoy discovering uniquely creative talent jumbled into a dish, you will absolutely love this place! The outdoor patio is cooled off by mist sprayers and is most enjoyable when temperatures hit over 110 in the valley. The indoor seating and furniture is made of the finest genuine leather with unique stitching and paisley design. You really get the vibe of the Wild West with a dash of modern. The wait staff are super sweet and always accommodates any request, whether dining alone or in large parties. The bar is to die for, by far the most refreshing drinks I've had in a very long time. If you love incredibly delicious food, fine service and beautiful surroundings and decor, this restaurant is screaming your name!"}
{"text":"The food here is good and the setting is outstanding. The patio is particularly pleasant, especially at happy hour. So why not more stars? We've been there twice. The first time was happy hour on the patio, and the service was really outstanding. The, with friends in tow, we went for lunch. The place wasn't particularly crowded, but that didn't motivate our server to pat attention. In fact she couldn't be bothered, not to check if we needed anything or to offer refills on drinks. Given that I was the only one drinking coffee, she had difficulty remembering where to put the cup. I guess that raises questions about where her head might have been. The upshot: I'd go back but I wouldn't urge others to go there."}
{"text":"Started out looking for a decent happy hour. Web site showed a burger. Arrived,...not allowed to sit on patio and eat off the happy hour menu. You have eat at the bar or sit on a couch. 
Tried the bar. \"The burger is not on the happy hour menu anymore and the website has not been updated\". Ordered beer battered fish tacos and they were out of them. 
How about the drinks? You could serve them to children they are truly that weak. 
This is my second time here, the drinks were weak last time as well. 
Too bad about the food, because the décor is really unique. 

Update the website today!!
Happy hour is regulated by the clock not the chair you sit on!! 3 to 6pm no other phony rules.
If you are out of a menu item then the server knows it and corrects it. Make something up.
Drinks should cross your eyes and the ice should correct the perfect pour if you have a tiny bit of patience!!!"}
{"text":"I want ALMA to move to Seattle. 

Visited ALMA twice during a four-night stay in Scottsdale, both times for brunch. My order was the exact same both visits as was my husband's. That's how much we enjoyed ourselves during our first visit. 

Me:
2 bloody marys
Migas

Him:
2 bloody marys
Blueberry and bacon pancakes (he omitted the bacon from the pancakes the second time around which they then served as slices on the side)

Great service and great food. Worthy of all 5 stars."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing experience here. It was their debut of the Mimosa Kit that comes with a bottle of champagne, syrups, juices and berries all to share at the table for $40 and well worth it. The food was excellent and their was genuine hospitality with people stopping by to check on everything. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went for Breakfast at about 11:00 today.   The place was hopping.
this was our first visit to Alma.  Emily is a great server.  John an awesome manager.
the food was exceptional. Huge portions and piping hot.
the Kitchen was busy due to AZ Breakfast Weekend.  Little slow but totally understandable.
this place has been open for 6 weeks.  

Give these people a break with the negative comments.  it takes at least a good 6 months to iron out the kinks. 

please support Scottsdale

loving my shirt!!!!"}
{"text":"Visited today for the first time: Great ambience and outdoor dining. Used a check-in coupon to get 10% off breakfast. I highly recommend the \"some like it hot\" corncakes with eggs. Overall, great service and good food."}
{"text":"Great Specials (black bean tostadas) wonderful entrees, (short rib ravioli) beautiful setting, and marvelous service by Christine. A bit expensive, however."}
{"text":"ALMA has good food, a nice outdoor space, and friendly staff. They're open early until late without closing for crossover which is nice too. If POMO is too busy, hop on over here. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our second dinner at Alma, and we were just as pleased tonight as the first time.  I had the pork chops and my wife the scallops, wow!  Really enjoyed our meals, the friendly  service and smiles were a nice interaction.  Even though we had a couple of nice conversations with our waiter he was a gentleman and not over bearing!
We will definitely be going back and recommend everyone give it a chance!"}
{"text":"We just finished brunch at Alma. It exceeded our expectations. And they were high to begin with. We had been to Soul Cafe, loved it and wanted to go back, so having their \"southern branch\" open in our neighborhood made it so much easier and more convenient. The food is first rate, the service could not be any better. Eric, who waited on us at Soul over 4 months ago, recognized and welcomed us to Alma. The owner Sheila, has transformed the formerly dark space into something comfortable bright and beautiful. The north inside wall of charms is spectacular! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! The jalapeño bacon is fantastic! Our waiter was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I are here AT LEAST every two weeks. It has quickly become my favorite restaurant in the valley for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The atmosphere is fun with a gorgeous patio, beautiful interior and it is baby-friendly for brunch and lunch. Our five month-old daughter has been here more times than most of our friends. For breakfast, the pancakes are HUGE and really good. The breakfast enchiladas are my favorite. They.are.so.good! Their specials are usually some of the most fun and incredibly tasty dishes. I had a smoked salmon avocado toast last weekend that was a daily special and it was perfect. Last fall I had a pumpkin ravioli with a brown butter sauce as one of their dinner specials. Again, so good. All of their staff members are friendly, kind, and helpful. Dear ALMA, keep doing what you are doing! We love that you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"There was nothing that we didn't like. The Feel Refreshed cucumber cocktail did just that. The Monsoon was an excellent combination of spiced rum and ginger beer and lime. The medallions entree was cooked to perfection. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"My first time for a meal to this restaurant. Excellent service and food. Great server named Emily. Hands down best Mai tacos.
Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Dear Alma, can you relocate to Tampa...please?! This place is phenomenal. Luckily for us we were staying in the area and I discovered this little gem based on appearance (drive by) but after looking at reviews on Yelp I knew that I must go! 

Eric, our most excellent server, was very welcoming and attentive. The alcoholic breakfast drinks were delicious. Alma features a special Bloody Mary with  in-house jalapeño smoked bacon. Awesome. The food menu also boasts this same aforementioned bacon and an array of other tasty and unique food options. 

I enjoyed the Rainbow Trout breakfast with eggs, vegetables and multi-color home fries. This meal was phenomenal and just what I wanted--a relatively healthy breakfast. My sister ordered the Migas plate which comes with pinto beans (they are made along with pork, the rest of the entrée does not have meat). My mom had some egg scrabble with chicken and vegetables and she greatly enjoyed her meal as well. We split two ginormous pancakes--one pumpkin with a bomb Mexican caramel sauce (you really must try it--Eric said he could eat a whole vat of it every day) and the other one a lemon ricotta pancake. These were truly excellent and between that and our meals more than us hungry hippos could eat in one sitting. We ended up with leftovers for another meal/tasty treat.

The decor of the restaurant is chic and western-ish with trendy charm yet cozy. There are a variety of booths and tables for parties of all sizes. The outdoor patio is stunning and looks like a fabulous place to chill. I would definitely love to come back for lunch or dinner or for a happy hour. 

The restaurant is in the fringe of the Shops at Gainey Ranch and has a good amount of parking adjacent. Don't miss this gem of a restaurant--it has only been open a few months and I can tell that it will be a mainstay. I also look forward to trying the sister restaurant, Soul Cafe, because if Alma is thus good I can imagine SC is on par as well. Thanks for a memorable and very delectable meal, Alma WXSW Cuisine! I'll definitely be back!"}
