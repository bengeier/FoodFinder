{"text":"Stopped by for dinner and got the fish with rice, cold chicken noodles and chicken congee. The service was really quick and portions were generous. We got a huge bowl of congee for $5, couldn't even finish all the food and got to take some home. The noodles were very refreshing and rice was very flavourful, the fish was tender with a creamy sauce. Would definitely come here again, the food was good quality with quick service and surprisingly cheap service."}
{"text":"This place can be a hit or miss the past 5 years I've been here. Food was good and had great service today. Some other days not so much. I like their under $5 breakfast and cheap afternoon tea meals though."}
{"text":"The orders came out wrong and blame on customers.  Not planning to go back. Food is standard, service is so so"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after seeing Golden Elephant was closed down for good. Turns out, this place is not that bad. They have quite an extensive menu list with lots of special. To start things off, got some milk tea and fresh watermelon juice.

Things we ordered:

Turnip (XO style)- cube shape turnip with bean sprouts and xo sauce. This is not bad, but it kept reminding me of how good Congee Queen one was back then with their Chili turnip. 

Clams w/black bean chilli sauce- The sauce mixture for this is quite nice, and the clams are the usual. The price is $10 which is good. 

Lemon Chicken (Dark meat)- We were anticipating that it was like chicken ball with lemon sauce, but it was cutlet style. The skin is nice and crispy and its not totally drowned in sauce, so it was quite alright. For $12.99, its quite good deal.

Bamboo Shrimp Fried Rice- $13.99! Its steam for 20 mins with generous amounts of half shrimps with white eggs on rice. This seems to be a growing trend in the chinese restaurant now. I still prefer it at Joy Fortune on VP!

Overall, this place is not that bad. The service was nothing special, they just bring your food and that's about it. The place looks spacious with a lot of booths, so its good for couples."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap, quick and tasty lunch, this is definitely the place to go for me. The staff is friendly, and the place has a bright and friendly atmosphere. I particularly like their deal where you can get a drink included with your meal! I go here frequently ^_^"}
{"text":"been here many times usually for late night snack. food is always tasty. lots of variety."}
{"text":"Order the Crispy Fried Chicken with Black Pepper sauce on rice. My personal favourite and recommendation. Good portion."}
{"text":"Came here the other night during the week.
Wasn't too busy and so we easily were seated immediately.
I was pretty full already but my friend wasn't so I ordered a French toast with peanut butter and condensed milk with milk pudding.
Toast was above expectations while the milk pudding is average at best. 
I gave 5 stars simply because the service was served with a smile, food was timely, and price is good too."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  I remember they open very late too which is quite nice especially they you're a night owl that needs to eat!  I think my friends and I were there about 1am once.  They have a good variety of HK style chinese food.  Prices were average.  Nothing special about the atmosphere, just a casual type of restuarant.  Food - some are good and some just ok."}
{"text":"Kennys noodle is your typical HK Cafe style restaurant. Their menu offers a wide range of selections. They have rice & noodle dishes. One of the things that makes Kennys noodle unique is the steam / fried rice dishes that they offer. They offer a wide range of jumbo shrimp / lobster steam rice.

We came here twice for a late night meal. We ordered the chicken mushroom stir fry with a stir fry beef rice noodle dish. They were filling and delicious. Both dishes came fairly quickly. 

The second time we visited, we ordered the sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, and fried turnip. All the dishes came quickly. However, it should be noted that their dishes are on the oily side. 


Will definitely be back for the lobster steam rice!"}
{"text":"Relatively cheap food for its quality. Good place to go if nothing is open past 10 or if you can't decide. Lots of space and accepts major cards too. Ordered crispy chicken with black pepper sauce on rice and a hot milk tea. Quick and delicious at 6.99. Delivered what was promised."}
{"text":"Decided to drop in here while my parents went to No Frills. Ordered the bean curd with spicy salt to sit and eat. Got curry beef brisket noodle soup, pork w/ preserved egg congee and squid with spicy salt take-away for the rest of the family. Came up to under $30 including tax and tip.
The menu is standard chinese food and they were pretty flavourful.
I'm glad Kenny's Noodle delivers good food with fast and friendly service. Plus... The interior is pretty nice compared to most chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"This resto has good clay pot rice.  We were invited by close friends to join them for lunch.  Just happened to stumble across the clay pot rice options in their menu under the category labelled \"Rice in Hot Pot\".  Been looking for a place to satisfy our clay pot rice cravings in Scarborough/Markham area.  

This resto has a large extensive menu to choose from, serving Cantonese & HK style fare.

Service is kinda hit and miss at times, this is our 2nd visit as of this writing.  Slight language barrier with the staff (English not comprehended easily).

You are offered complimentary hot tea upon seating.  Decent condiment offerings at each table.

Portion sizes seem small for the a-la-cart prices for the dishes.  The dishes that are served in bamboo steamers only appear to look \"big\" but the steamers are shallow.  We enjoyed the steamed seafood and meat sticky rice ($13.99) which is served in a large bamboo steamer.

Definitely will be making repeat visits."}
{"text":"Kind of stuck between 3-4 stars. A pretty good place for some Hong Kong styled dishes! The service here is not the best (waiters/waitresses zoom by you really and basically ignore you for the most part after you place your order), but the food here comes quickly.

I love their peking duck and their clay pot rice. They have a wide variety of foods, so you'll need a few to decide exactly what you want."}
{"text":"Friend highly recommended this place. Ordered the shanghai noodle dish came with a free coffee all for 7.99$. Realized why it was so lowly priced while eating my cold noodle and flavorless bland pork chops. What made me give it 2 stars you ask? The chili oil on the table gave my meal some life."}
{"text":"Had a quick dinner with my brother here the other day, i really wanted fish maw soup but I really didn't want to drive all the way to congee queen considering I wanted it to be \"quick\" 

Service was OK, server(s) were there when needed and didn't hesitate to help. It wasn't too busy but at the same time there was only two of them with a decent amount of tables. I wouldn't bust their balls in terms of service too much because the Chinese service standards are set pretty low in my eyes.

Food was typical Chinese food; growing up around it might make me a little bias considering it all taste the same to me at this point. Ordered the fish maw soup which was pretty decent but not as good as Congee Queens, Sizzling beef with honey pepper sauce was good and was probably the best thing I ordered to be honest. The last thing I got was the shrimp fried rice in bamboo steamer, I was really looking forward to this but it left my mouth really dry and seemed like it was packed with MSG it was good besides that, a little on the garlicky side but that ain't a problem with me 

Overall it's quick convenient and the food isn't bad by all means but with the surrounding area having so many options for the same style of food, I might consider going somewhere that doesn't pack their food with that much MSG."}
{"text":"I've been coming here every Friday night during the summer for the last 3-4 years with my rec softball team after games.  They are open until 1am Friday nights which makes it perfect for us.

They have 1 very large table which we have comfortably sat 14 people at, and they can seat any groups smaller than that quite easily.  The washrooms are usually pretty grimey.  The wait staff are pretty friendly, and everyone has a passable knowledge of English.

The food is your typical Cantonese style fare.  If you come during non-peak hours, they have a \"Happy Hour\" menu which includes a meal and a hot drink (cold drinks are an extra $1.25).  I highly recommend their baked chicken/pork chop dishes which come with your select of portuguese/curry/black pepper/tomato sauce on rice/spaghetti."}
{"text":"Delicious, Well priced, and great service 5/5. I great place to dine, have some tea or just chill out with friends

I came to Kenny''s for lunch not expecting the best from a Chinese cafe/restaurant as most places in Markham is just mediocre but Kenny's noodles really shot it out the park.

I had the cart noodles, with curry fish ball, red sausage, and beef brisket. It was a 6.99 for 2 toppings a deal with 1.50 add on for an extra topping. It was delicious the broth was salty and hot, noodles cooked great, and the beef brisket was tender and SO flavorful!!.

The French toast I ordered was also amazing, toast filled with peanut butter fried and drenched in condensed milk it was crispy and soft and chewy at the same time.

I filled myself up with 10 dollars at kenny's the prices here are fantastic

Onwards my friends and I talked for another hour with often tea replacement from the staff and nobody who bothered us go leave soon!! Which usually happens very often in Markham.

I'm super impressed, and I can't wait to go back for more cart noodles and French toast!"}
{"text":"Kenny's Noodle is a classic place in the Toronto region for home style Cantonese cuisine. There are a lot of good menu selections in terms of Cantonese classics, but what you really should for is obviously the noodles. The noodles are well prepared and very reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend trying the breakfast menu or the tea break menu if you are looking for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"So sad. The food is decent but for some odd reason they don't offer drinks with meals on holidays only which is why they are completely empty during public holidays. Not sure if they're trying to save money or whatever the reasoning. But it's definitely not bringing in business."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty standard Cantonese cuisine restaurant. 
The restaurant was fairly busy on a Friday evening. We were a party of 4 and were seated as soon as we walked in. 
The menu is pretty extensive and decided to order pretty common dishes: Yang Chow fried rice, sweet and sour pork, crab and fish maw soup, and salty and spicy squid. The food was good but on the saltier side. 
The service was really good and the servers were attentive, our tea container was refilled before we even had to ask and the first dish came out 5 mins after we placed our order. 

I would probably come back if I was in the area but otherwise it wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Hard to say much about Kenny noodle, its been here for many years, and is oftentimes solid as a rock. It is a hong kong cafe, in every sense. serving baked rice during lunch, and dishes at night. 

This longtime Hong kong cafe has been around the area for a long time. For lunch i would definitely recommend get the baked Portuguese chicken, which we got. as it is very good. and as a lunch special will offer a hot drink for free. We went for the baked rice. and i would have to say that although it is not as good as it used to be in terms of the sauce, as the sauce Portuguese sauce is slightly more diluted then it was not enough curry powder to mix with it. 

The other dish we had was the baked tomato pork chop with rice, now this dish the pork chop is tender and done right, the only problem is unlike their previously done sauce, they need more sugar in the sauce. 

Overall this place it is fast and no frill although not as good as it used to be in  terms of baked rice, it is still very much one of the better hong kong cafes in the area for all your necessary needs for lunch and dinner. 

i would recommend people in the area try it if they haven't already. since it is affordable and a great sized lunch that will keep you full and satisfied.

Service is your typical hong kong cafe so expect it to be no frills speed and efficent"}
{"text":"Surprisingly decent food served fast and furious in a noisy, street-stall, dining room atmosphere. The menu is perhaps too large as it offers practically everything under the sun. Specials galore from breakfast, to afternoon tea time, to dinner. I was impressed with the freshness, tastiness and wok-heat of the dishes we had one evening. There's a madness to the dining experience when the place is full, but the staff delivers the goods with efficiency and little attitude. Given all the options available in the area, this restaurant deserves recognition for exceeding its competition on many levels. One note: I found the fast-food items (noodles & congee) far less exciting than the entree dishes on the dinner menu. Still, a quality stop for nosh in this sea of humanity."}
{"text":"I travel 30 mins to come here if i crave chinese food thats real fast.
The food is good.
The service is good.
The price is crazy good.
Now why are people still going to spring roll?"}
{"text":"The chestnut pumpkin congee - the chestnut was sour and stale...had to return it and ordered something else.  Perhaps just wrong batch of chestnuts used.  They didn't seem happy that we pointed this out.

Other dishes seem fine.  

Would probably give it another chance but rating based on this visit alone."}
{"text":"Great place as a everyday eats, I found the food there to be average but because of the price its totally understandable. The service is to be expected for a Chinese place but the speed of how fast they get the food too you makes it worth it.

Love to get take out from here and the food is always tasty"}
{"text":"We came here last week Saturday for a late lunch. This is a fast Hong Kong style congee noodle and Cantonese dish restaurant. I can tell they have a regular following here. Not that busy around 2pm. The service was fast and friendly. We ordered a lobster set menu which came with twin lobsters, we chose ginger and onion style, other dishes were free range shredded chicken, garlic beef with mushrooms sizzling plate style, and bok choy with mushrooms. We also ordered roasted squab. They do a good job here and it's authentic Cantonese dishes. Everything was delicious. I always have a good dining experience here. Only issue is washrooms downstairs and a bit of a walk but maintained. Family friendly. Would come back again."}
{"text":"One of the best Cantonese restaurants in Markham. Their menu is HUGE & everything we order here is always spot on. We usually come here when we're looking for some good Cantonese food. Customer service is also not too bad it being a Chinese restaurant.

They renovated 2 years ago, however for more improvement I would suggest a restroom renovation. Overall, a really good restaurant, will come back again  in the future for more!"}
{"text":"Summary: versatile restaurant offers Hong Kong style baked lunches as well as traditional Chinese dinner dishes for decent prices, good quality, and acceptable portions, plus opens late!

Top Must-Get: Portuguese sauce baked chicken with noodles
Top Regret: mango smoothie

Not spectacular, but solid: Kenny's Noodle doesn't particularly excel at any single dish or aspect (although it looks a lot classier since it renovated a few years ago), but instead does many things fairly well. It's quite roomy, they've got comfortable car seats, and their service is decent (service is pretty good if you're a regular). They were actually very kind in giving us a lot of cups and refilling our water jug a few times (I in particular drink like a parched hippo).

They have a comprehensive menu that boasts of both lunches and dinner options, and there isn't much that is poorly done.

I mean, it's kind of boring to say that they're just \"good\", but that's what it is - \"good\".

Their congee is fairly good, their baked chicken/pork offerings are pretty good, and my personal favourite used to be their black pepper sauce, which was... good. They also have a huge variety of traditional Chinese dinner dishes. My friend from Taiwan also remarked that their Taiwanese dishes are fair.

It's a safe place to try new things!

They have a happy hour from 2:30 - 5:30 where lunches come with drinks (more selection in their drinks).


The only issues...?

The washrooms are down the stairs, and sometimes the stairs look slippery, and I always imagined how much it would suck to fall down while needing to go. So... Be careful! (They do apparently have an accessible washroom for seniors and people with disabilities on the main floor though).

Also, they have followed the trend of other Hong Kong style places in charging extra for honey (lemon honey tea costs $0.50 more than lemon tea) and their smoothies are honestly a little bit off (and only one flavour smoothies - no mixing, so coconut mango smoothie craving is not one you'll satisfy).

Opens late!

I used to be a regular here, and still come on occasion for late night munchings!"}
{"text":"A popular diner that serves lunch and dinner in Scarborough. This is one of my favorite spots for good cheap HK style food. Most of the dishes here range from $5-$15 with a majority of the dishes under $10. They have quite the extensive menu and it is always hard to choose one particular dish as all the dishes look very appetizing and delicious. I decided to order the baked chicken with rice in Portuguese sauce which is one of my favorite dishes here. It comes with a complimentary hot beverage or you pay $1.25 extra for a cold drink. For $8.50 and with the portion size and chicken, it's a pretty good deal. Food came out pretty quickly. There top parts of the dish were a little bit burnt but nonetheless, it was a delicious dish and hits the right spot. Overall, a great place to get your HK Style Fix and one of my local favorites in the area. Highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"i went to Kenny noodle for the lunch special. had a chance to try two different dishes. this is a hong kong cafe place, that is very much a traditional hong kong cafe, that serves the old school western inspired chinese food. The baked rice we had was a portugese sauce chicken, and a tomato sauce pork chop. both are baked rice. 

The sauce for these two baked rice are not done very well as some other places. however the meat is tender and the price is not bad. 

I would recommend those in the area who want a quick lunch that is filling and not too expensive."}
{"text":"All I can say is YUMMY! We stopped by for lunch today after strawberry picking. We orders a lot of food and managed to eat it all. The service was good as well. The Hong Kong crab- amazing. The honey pepper beef, delicious. The sizzling beef ribs perfect and tender and mango tapioca dessert was also delicious. My son had seconds on everything. He really enjoyed the fried chicken as well."}
{"text":"There have been many Kenny's Noodle restaurants that has opened up around the Markham/Scarborough area in the recent few years. Though each restaurant offers different deals, the dishes on the menu are consistent. There are separate menus that contain all-day combos (great for late-nights) and another that offers specifically for lunch and dinner.

Kenny's Noodles offers HK style meals and dining experience. Quick and attentive service, food served quickly and in generous portions, and with affordable pricing. It is a convenient choice when your group of friends are undecided on a restaurant to eat at. 

One of my favourite dishes is the baked pork chop in tomato sauce served with either spaghetti or rice. The sauce comes slightly burnt. It's definitely a hearty meal for one!

This place is A-Ok!"}
{"text":"wow what a makeover!! Felt like I was in the wrong restaurant for a moment.  Thankfully I came here so I could post an updated review.  A lot cleaner, up to date, contemporary decor, clean, etc..  It kind of reminded me of Star WALK buffet's interior design.....maybe there must had been a 2-for-1 deal with the contractor haha. 
As always this place has a lot of choices, portions are satisfying, price is very reasonable and the food is served quickly.

We had their green beans with pork 5/5, cooked to perfection! The beans had a slight crunch, and was very flavorful. The pork added extra flavor and necessary balance of salt to the overall dish.  Thankfully the green beans were not over cooked! good job!

Turnip cake with xo salt 4/5, is one of their popular side dishes that compliments your meal. Again, cooked well, slight crunch on the outside! equal balance of salt, mixed in with some shrimp and beans.

Fish fillet with Eggplant and black olives in HOT POT! 4/5
You can never go wrong with Hot pot @ Kenny's.  Taste is bang on, and not too overly salty, and they didn't go cheap on fish portions, as some other restaurants do.  Overall a great dish to top off our early dinner.

This place never disappoints...especially now with the new FACE LIFT RENOVATIONS"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place, as the food is seasoned terribly. Here's a review of the items ordered

Hong Kong style chow mein was too greasy and salty.

Deep fried salt & pepper squid had the right amount of heat but they didn't salt it so it was bland.

Their signature dish (egg whites and prawns over a bed of fried rice steamed in a bamboo steamer lined with a lotus leaf - there is a picture posted on yelp) was extremely bland. I had to add the over salted chow mein to my bowl in order to eat it."}
{"text":"Decent place for some late night eats if you want to avoid typical fast food or pizza.  

Service can be hit-or-miss at times though.  Either servers aren't paying attention or things are forgotten (had to ask 2-3 times for our drinks + the bill), other than that the food quality is pretty consistent.

Overall, the quality of food is decent for the price (some dishes could be a bit less oily), but when the late night munchies hit, it's a great alternative from the fast food options in the area."}
{"text":"I've never seen such a huge menu.  Too many choices.  But the food is really good and the portions are big. 

The ambiance is perfect for lunch, busy, noisy and really fast service.  In and out in 40 minutes and ready to continue with our day.

I had spicy noodles, fried softshell crab and green beans in oyster sauce or something.  Really good."}
{"text":"My wife and I spent $46 dollar tonight. We got tonight's dinner, tomorrow's lunch and dinner, AND lunch for the day after tomorrow. Not sure if I can find another restaurant with such a great portion, price and taste."}
{"text":"Kenny's has been around for quite a long time. I'm not sure what I can add to it.. it's just your standard Chinese place that serves a little bit of everything. 

Food is okay, service is okay. I guess it's a good place to go for quick and cheap eats."}
{"text":"Kenny's is basically an institution for late night munchies, tea time meals and cantonese diner cravings. They do the basic cantonese comfort foods no matter if it's rice, noodle, soup or toast. Recently came for dinner and had the steamed rice and shrimp wrapped in a lotus leaf. It took a while to come but it's worth the wait because it was hot, filling and delicious. But if that isn't what you are craving, there is a long list of choices to search through. 

Service is brisk but quick with both requests and ordering, as can be expected from this well-oiled restaurant machine. Plenty of booths and some larger tables for bigger groups makes it easy to find a seat."}
{"text":"Usually come here for lunch. They have afternoon tea specials from 2:30pm, you get a free drink (Usually get their HK Milk Tea). Tried a lot of the dishes on their menu. I usually get their satay vermicelli. I've also tried their House special noodle & Gualin Vermicelli which is also pretty good. The staff is pretty nice here! If you want a quick bite, this place is pretty good for lunch!"}
{"text":"I always come back for the Portuguese chicken and sizzling beef ribs. Been coming here for years. Everything that I have tried here has been good. They open late and food comes out pretty quick."}
{"text":"Service was stellar today. I've never had service like this at an HK style cafe. We went in and I think it might be the owner/manager? was super friendly and seated us. We had our first dish within minutes and our drinks even sooner. Service was really friendly - they even came by and asked us if the food was okay which is something I've only seen western places do. I was taken by surprise and I wasn't sure if I heard right and my parents didn't even realize that she had asked. My brother drinks a lot of water - when we asked for a refill the waitress came by, poured him water and then set the whole bottle down for our convenience (and hers too probably). She could have just set the bottle down but she poured it for him anyway.

We got ready to pay and she must have seen our 50 dollar bill - to be fair it's hard to miss. Before we even flagged someone down she'd given us our change and receipt and we just gave her the $50. Her math was right too. I was impressed at how efficient that was and according to my parents it's just how it is in Hong Kong because of the high turnover of tables. The restaurant today was half full. Best service I've ever had at an HK style cafe.

However, the food today wasn't as good - they changed their recipe for the baked pork chop rice with tomato sauce it seems. While before it leaned more sweet, now it's more on the sour side. Too sour and not even rice, tons of sauce - even if they gave half a bowl more in the dish there would have been enough. We ordered extra rice and then it was too much. And there was a whole piece of fat that had been fried along with the actual meat. Some people are into it, but I'm not. Note that adding cheese or a fried egg costs an extra dollar. Some places (like Phoenix) do this but at other places dishes come with cheese already.

Same with the chicken with Portuguese sauce - not enough rice, too much of everything else. Fried noodles with beef were great today though. Definitely crunchy enough this time around and beef was delicious and tender. Milk tea and coffee were quite good. Overall there are some inconsistencies with the food but it's never bad food."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Every time I come here, I always think to myself how much I miss the Markham location. It's closer, my family knew pretty much every employee, and we get discounts. None of that here... :(

Kenny's Noodle has always been a \"late night\" spot for me, since they open to midnight or so most days. I usually just order a small meal there, for example today I had the seaweed cuttlefish ball noodle soup. It's about on par with what you pay ($7 or so), perhaps my only complaint is the fact some of the noodles were stuck together and was too thick to eat in one bite. Aside from that, no arguments at all about this place.

Service is a little iffy at times, but that's expected for HK style cafes. Look beyond that, and it's definitely a foolproof location in terms of good quality."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite go to spots for relaxed HK style food. You get a mix of families and groups of friends hanging so the atmosphere is very welcoming. I went with my boyfriend last night for dinner and the place was pretty packed. The best part about kennys is they're always SUPER QUICK (like scary quick) attentive service leads to table turnover leading to a successful business. Go Kennys! 

Food: I got the deep fried pork chops in spicy salt and my boyfriend got the spicy beef brisket noodles:

Pork chops - yuuuum I would say does the job right, dish was served hot and fresh. Pretty juicy and crispy 8/10

Beef brisket - (boyfriend) \"it was good, beef brisket was kind of hard could have been more tender but solid quick meal\" 7/10

*I have to add the dishes were served 5 minutes after ordering...concerning? Or awesome kitchen staff? Either way I was good with it but just a fact*

I'm definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot for lunch but I found other places around the area to have better tasting food at a better price. However, I do come here with friends sometimes and I enjoy getting smoothies or dessert. Their black sesame paste is not the best in the world but it will satisfy your sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here regularly. The menu is great as there is one page that is pure vegetarian. The waitresses are like those in Hong Kong, fast and ready at a moment's notice.  They are always very considerate and ask if you want the recipe changed; they will always notify you if there is garlic (which some Buddhists avoid), milk or cheese if you mention you're herbivorous. 

My staples here often include fried salted tofu and vegetarian baked rice with white sauce and mock ham, red bean ice.  The baked rice dish comes with mock ground beef, and if they run out, the chefs will gladly substitute fake ham!  Yes, it is a little salty side but you can't help but feel satisfied when you leave.

Great place to go if you've got conflicting diets in a group of hungry people!"}
{"text":"I came here to eat around midnight, seems like a typical HK restaurant.

I ordered curry beef on rice; it was very salty and was not what I have expected it to be, there were a lot of tendon on the beef, some were not too chewable. I would not recommend getting this dish. Their radio was very static-sounded. Maybe I would give it another try in the future and order something else. One thing I liked about the place was the speed of their service."}
{"text":"Kenny's is a legend in the area. It's along Steeles at the Scarborough-Markham border, but no other obscure Chinese restaurant can compete with the signature baked rice/spaghetti dishes at Kenny's. Proud to say I've been a regular customer for 10 years running. They are affordable and are open very late. Perfect for large groups of hungry people. You never feel rushed, scan through the menu and dine at your own pace. They give no hassle when splitting the bill and food is pretty consistent. They DO accept debit card payment with a minimum purchase.

What you should order:
- Crispy chicken or beef brisket on rice with Portuguese sauce ($8.50). Add cheese and egg for a small additional cost ($1.25 each)
- Crispy chicken or beef brisket on rice with black pepper sauce ($8.50)
- Rice with shrimps in bamboo steamer ($15.99)
- French toast with condensed milk ($7.50)
- Hong Kong style tea ($2.99)

However, order what you know - I don't recommend getting adventurous with the menu. Tried that 3 times and each time I was disappointed and wished I got the Portuguese sauce rice dish. Tea isn't great  either. Servers are mediocre friendly but very attentive. Love Kenny's - will always be back."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Kenny's Noodles for years, and it consistently stays one of my favourite Hong Kong-style cafes in Scarborough. The interior decor is nice and bright, with ample amounts of seating and rarely a long wait for a table. Customer service is also friendly and relatively reliable. The restaurant features an extensive menu of Hong Kong and Cantonese-style fare, such as French toast, baked rice, chow mein, Chinese-style lobster, and so on. I come here primarily for their baked rice/spaghetti. The quality of the food is consistently good and the prices are reasonable. They also have afternoon tea specials. All in all, this is a great spot for a quick bite and for groups since there's probably something for everyone to enjoy."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner after reading the reviews and wanted to try it. We ordered from the specials menu and ordered Minced Pork and Eggplant in Hotpot, Spareribs With Bean Curd Sheet and Chestnut In Hotpot  and Steamed Tilapia With Soy Sauce. The tilapia was an extra $5 surcharge. Originally, we were going to order the Baked Pork Chops in Portuguese Sauce but the waitress told us that they used the same oil that's used to make the peanut butter toast. Even though the Baked Pork Chops is peanut free, they use the same oil from the Peanut Butter Toast. She didn't feel it was safe for our daughter to eat it because of her peanut allergy. So, instead we ordered the Spareribs hotpot. We liked the Spareribs Hotpot a lot but we liked the Eggplant Hotpot a lot more. There was a hint of sweetness and spiciness at the same time. Daughter liked the tofu that came with it. We don't get that in the US in our eggplant order! The tilapia was delicious as well. It was nice and soft with the perfect amount of soy. Service was very friendly and quick. I loved that the waitress was very knowledgeable with the menu and was sensitive about the food allergies. She even made sure that the free soup was nut free! They had charged us $15 for the fish but I told them that we ordered it from the Dinner special and it was quickly fixed. Love this place and will definitely return when in the area!"}
{"text":"Leaving a review before the food even arrived. The menu said the noodles come with a drink but when we were ordering the server said today is a holiday (Canada Day) so it doesnt come with a drink. There was no sign any where that mentioned this. A hot milk tea does not cost much. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Inexpensive hong kong cafe food with a trillion options and decent price point for noon and afternoon tea. Food is average, nothing to write home about. Good place to go if you are in a hurry and looking for cheap, comfortable eats as an Asian."}
{"text":"This is another of the Kenny's Noodle franchise in the Scaborough area. The menu is similar to other Kenny's Noodle Restaurant. The only difference is this place is really roomy. 

We were here for dinner so we ordered the 3 dishes set for $27.99 which you can choose from over 30 different dishes. We also upgraded one of the dish for $2.99 extra for a whole steamed fish.

I have to tell you the fish is huge! 1.5 lbs at least. All the dishes we ordered were quite tasty!

The service is fast and friendly!

They accept Mastercard and Visa (under $30 with 25cents charge)."}
{"text":"Used to be good... But they changed owners and even their names are changed.

None of the dishes we ordered are up to par... the usual Kenny's Noodle's qualities.

I would not go back there!"}
{"text":"Have you ever had something with so much oil it stays on your mouth, lips and lingers in your throat? This is the place for that. 

Every dish we got literally felt like it was drenched in oil. This place serves Cantonese food and reminds me of Keungs Delight but it is nothing like it. The dishes are small and expensive and extremely oily. 

We ordered the giant bamboo tray shrimp fried rice thing and it was really disappointing. The shrimps were small and the rice was mushy and soft. If you looked at the bottom of the bamboo tray, there lies a river of oil enough to fill your car. We got Bok Choy with mushroom and again, drenched in oil. In the sauce, you can see the oil residue build up, and a very clear separation of the sauce and oil. Other dishes included green onion oyster in sizzling pot and a stir fried pork dish with mushroom and celery, all which felt like oil was a major ingredient. My hands are oily now and all the utensils we used were oily, it's everywhere and unavoidable!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok.  We came for the Happy Hour deal.  Order a meal and get a free drink.  Big portions.  The Red bean herb gelatin ice cream fountain was really yummy; much better than the Spanish coffee."}
{"text":"I hate to share negative reviews but here it comes. I was welcomed into the restaurant, I was seated and given some time to review the menu before ordering. 

When it came to ordering, the lady took my order as she was walking by and it seemed like she barely acknowledged my order. As I am waiting for my food, I am noticing other tables nearby are filling up and their orders being taken. 10-15 minutes pass by, these other tables that settled in after me got their food. I wait for another 15 minutes until I finally get their attention and they say that the food is coming. 

With my patience running thin, I gave it a final 10 minutes and the food still didn't arrive. I let the staff know that the service is unacceptable and everyone got their food before me when I was in my seat with my order finalized before everyone else even sat down. I ended up walking out, never in my life have I ever walked out after committing to my order.

Horrible service, not sure what I did wrong in order to be ignored like this. I don't recommend this place based on this service."}
{"text":"Okay this used to be the best of the Kenny's but the stuff I ordered: brisket, oyster and scrambled eggs, and fried shrimp paste served two ways were ridiculously unappetizing. 

The meal started good enough. The free house soup was very good. 

The shrimp paste dish was very ugh. I am not sure what paste they used but yuck. 

Their scrambled eggs with oyster was ridiculously salty. You have to buffer it with so much rice in order to eat it. 

Their beef brisket just plain tastes weird. It's bearable though. 

To finish it, I did get free tofu-fa, which was pretty good.  Won't say super amazing, but compared to the rest of the stuff we actually paid for, it was not too bad.

At least there is free wifi that is why it did not get the lowest rating."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the chilli chicken here. It's the perfect amount of spice and heat, always fresh when I order it. 

The service is always fast when I come here with friends. Have never had to wait longer than 15 mins for our food. The waitresses are also very nice, every single visit. 

Located at old Kennedy and Steeles, parking is sometimes a task in its own, but it's worth the headache for Kenny and his noodles!!

Also, the Hong Kong French toast, sweet Jesus. So good!!! Must try for dessert!!!"}
{"text":"Quick and to the point service.  So glad they have fried intestine. Please don't judge..

Good food, affordable. Lots of choices. The waitresses are always nice"}
