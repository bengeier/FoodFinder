{"text":"Bailey's is a great place to hangout and play some pool and have some great pub food."}
{"text":"The fox and hound is located in the Birkdale shopping center.  They have a good selection of beers on tap and awesome drink specials.  They also have a full dinning room that services until late into the night if your looking for a little more than \"bar food\".  If your looking for a place to watch the UFC fight then this is the place.  It's gets busy on the weekends but a fun place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I only gave 3 stars for friendliness. ......wings were horrid, and if you are going to have all female bartenders make them semi attractive......no one wants to have 3's and 4's serving them"}
{"text":"Went to the hound vallet parking my boys take real good care of me.  Able to watch the Eagles and Redskins right next to each other.  Boy it's weird to watch an Eagles game and see McNabb on the TV next to the Eagles game.  Ordered a Philly chicken steak not as good as a cheese in Philly. Wife got An alpine burger, her usual.  Atmosphere is great, service was excellent tonight.  Ask for Ashley, she is good.  Can't wait for the real season to start.  It will most likely where I'll be for the football season"}
{"text":"As the star rating says, \"meh.\" It's an acceptable sports bar - lots of TVs, but none of them are really big or impressive so go somewhere else if you want to be immersed. The music is way too loud, this place needs to decide whether it's a sports bar or a club. The beer selection is weak. Sure, they have more than the usual AB-Miller selection, but what do they have? The same stuff you can get anywhere: Guinness Newcastle, etc. The only \"highlight\" is stocking two uninspired Great Lakes beers, Dortmunder (their blandest) and a seasonal. And the food was acceptable, but not good, and not really worth the money.  Let's sum up: lots of screens, but they're too small. Music too loud. Food is below average. Weak beer selection. It wasn't a bad experience, just not worth going to. Skip it."}
{"text":"Fox and Hound has better-than-average bar food and a better-than-average beer selection.  The service is efficient and friendly; the high turnover suggests it is not an easy place to work, but that probably goes with the territory.  Being in Birkdale, on weekends it can be hard to find a place to park.  It is usually crowded, and that contributes to a good vibe.  There are enough televisions to be able to catch whatever sporting event one is looking for."}
{"text":"Here for Pool League game.  Most tables are well groomed, balls are shiny and nick free.  Plenty of TVs to keep up with NFL Sunday games.  Food is a bit over priced and nothing to write home about.  Service is good, wait staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Food was cold, didn't get sides until we were finished with our food. Server never checked on us. We have been to a lot better fox and the hounds!!!"}
{"text":"I'll never go back. We had horribly slow service during a low volume lunch hour. When our food finally came out... The ham sandwich had a wad of wax paper that I guess the ham is packaged in,  IN THE SANDWICH!! They did comp the sandwich but I will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Really wouldn't come back here again. Service was awful. Waitress was nice but seemed new. She kept repeating our order wrong and after explaining what we wanted as appetizers and what we wanted as entrees she still brought everything out at once.  I ordered the spicy garlic wings and sweet chili wings. They were below average to average at best.  Chicken nachos were just ok as well.  Wouldn't recommend it here.. There are better places in the area."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the whiners reviewing this place were expecting.   This is a bar in a strip mall...   I went hoping to find a great place for an out-of-towner to watch a football game, and hopefully some decent food and drinks.   The TV's were great, even mapped out as to which game would be on which so we knew where to sit.   The appetizer sampler was tasty (all above average except for the mozzarella sticks which were...average, how could they not be)   Wings were quite tasty, try the Spicy Garlic, not too buttery like most places.   The Mahi Mahi sandwich was cheap for that amount of fish.   Place was dark and comfortable (my personal preference for bars)   There were some very cheap (compared to Nashville, where I am from) drink options.   If you're looking for a sports bar this is a great stop!   If you're looking for something else....well, don't go to bars in strip malls!!"}
{"text":"An average to below-average chain, casual sports bar.  Over-hyped and disappointing.   I visited this place twice recently: first to scope it out, chat with the manager on duty, and access if it would be a good place to bring family for a football Sunday lunch date the following week, and secondly to eat there.   The first visit went fine; the staff were friendly and engaging, the manager assured me that they had plenty of TVs with quality NFL coverage. He asked what games we would be watching and said they'd definitely have them available for 'easy viewing'. Otherwise, the place was mostly what I expected -- short on personality or charm, but large with plenty of tables and space.  I certainly left feeling like the restaurant fit the bill for what I was looking for and I looked forward to returning.   Fast-forward to the following visit and my party and I were instead greeted with a pretty poor experience.  I arrived in advance of my party at the restaurant a little after 1pm the following Sunday. The place was packed-to-the-gills. I expected busy, but they were slammed. I explained to the hostess I was waiting for the rest of my party to arrive, but I wanted to get on the waiting list for a table...    Surprise one: there is no wait list.  Instead, it's 'first-come, first serve and seat yourself.'  Oh really? That was never mentioned during my previous visit, darn. Instead she suggested I 'wander around and see if there are any open tables someplace'. (She unhelpfully motioned in a vague direction).  If I couldn't find a table, she suggested I 'go sit at the bar until you see if a table opens up, or instead I could find a table and ask the people when they would leave.'  Wow... really?  I understand that they were busy, but really.. that's their 'system'?  I checked around and not surprisingly, couldn't find a table that would fit 6 people.  I did curiously though spot a single patron or two, one of whom had claimed a six-top for himself, (maybe the rest of his party never showed?) and a family of 4, with a highchair, squeezed onto a two-top that could barely hold their plates, let alone anything for the kids. Good thing the sippy-cups fit on the floor...  I ended up at the bar, waiting for a table..  In the 30 minutes I waited at the bar, a large table in the main dining room, the one in view of most of the 'prime-game' TVs,  never opened up. Though to be fair, I didn't question or encourage anyone else to hurry up or leave so I could have their table. To compliment this, the bartender on duty never acknowledged my presence while I waited. Once I got up to greet the rest of my party, she did finally notice me and came over to ask if 'I was sitting at the bar because I wanted served?' Uh, well not now. I guess they get a lot of patrons who hang out at the bar in-limbo, waiting for a free table to materialize?  Once my party arrived, the 6 of us started to shuffle though the restaurant to find an open table somewhere that would work. Eventually, with the help of a slightly more helpful waiter, we were able to locate one in the back dining room.   Once our server arrived, I asked if it was possible to change the TV in our room over to a different  game and was told no. Apparently the specific games are pre-set to certain TVs and if you're not in the right spot you might not be able to view the game you want to. While I'm certainly not expecting a restaurant to rearrange everything, in my previous experience, most places are happy to at least try to accommodate you, and switching a channel on the TV is not completely unreasonable.  So much for 'easy viewing' I guess. For the record, the game we primarily wanted to watch was available on only one small TV, located at the very front of the restaurant, near the exit. Maybe that's a sign ;)  We ordered sandwiches a few people got some drinks. The food was okay, not bad, but not memorable or unique.  In general their menu is the same sandwiches, pizzas, and burgers that you see at pretty much any other casual dining chain establishment.  My mother-in-law remarked that her cocktail tasted 'pretty weak' and she declined a second one.  The service was otherwise adequate, and other than my father -in-law getting elbowed by a manager passing by - who apparently was too busy to notice our group, the rest experience was unremarkable.    In the end, it was the not experience that I was hoping for.  The place was certainly 'popular' and busy.  Most people seemed to be enjoying the place, so maybe my party was the odd-ball experience.  My experience though didn't instill me with a great desire to revisit this place anytime soon. I know that weekends are busy for sports bars, but I felt that their level of disorganization or 'ordered chaos' (maybe?) bordered on unprofessional and certainly unappealing to me.  If you do go, I recommended you hedge your expectations, arrive very early during peak times, and the smaller your party the better."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here a lot.  For the most part, I really have a good time.  Sometimes, they have \"events\" going on and that annoys me.  I was trying to shoot pool the last time we went and they had the back part of the place doing some kind of painting class.  It was very distracting.  I wanted to play pool, drink beer and listen to music.  Instead, I had to hear instructions on painting mixed in with the bar's ambient music and then the music the painting class brought along. We ended the night early that time.  As far as food, we liked it better a few months ago when it was owned by a different company I believe?  Food seems to have changed a bit but is still good.  Wings are not as good - they started lightly dusting the wings with flour I think.  Chicken wings should have no flour!!!  They have great chicken fingers, pretzle dippers, burgers..   I love to shoot pool and they always have the beer I like. Food is decent. It's also just a real casual place. I think those things make it deserving of 4 stars."}
{"text":"Beer ski ball is fun. The staff sorta pays attention to you sometimes"}
{"text":"The food is good so I've continued to come back despite the terrible service, however.. I think I've reached my breaking point now. Went for lunch. There were 5 people in the restaurant at most and my party of 3 were the only ones not sitting at the bar. Still waited 15 min for the waitress to take our order after having to ask multiple times to place an order because the was busy.. with what.. I don't know, seeing as the place was empty.  Check came out wrong but paid it anyway since I was on my lunch break and had already been there way too long.  Overall. I won't be going back. There's been too many instances of the same behavior with different waitresses either not caring or not knowing what they're doing."}
{"text":"Went for $4.00 burger night.   Short story. Good food, good beer selection, terribly slow and poor service.   It took some time for the waitress to get to our table. She was pleasant, but seemed frazzled. Our party of 4 (2 kids, 2 adults) ordered food and drinks. The drinks took quite a bit of time to come out. As we waited for our food (again a long wait), a manager (I think came out) and informed us they were out of sweet potato fries. We ordered regular fries and still waited some time for the food to come out.  The burgers were good, but the top of the buns were hot from sitting under the warming lamp for so long (guessing here). Ordered another beer from their good beer selection when the food came out. That again took forever.   Finished our food and had to wait sometime for the check to come. We asked for a box and the waitress took the half hamburger my son was eating. She came back with an empty box and had thrown away the left overs. All we got was a \"I am so sorry\".  Probably will not go back."}
{"text":"I read the reviews before going here, but said \"screw it,\" my buddy was in town and we loved Fox & Hound in Philly, so we went anyway.   I ordered something I thought a restaurant couldn't screw up - NACHOs. Welp, I was wrong. They came out cold with about an ounce of meat on top. Pretty much the worst nachos I've ever had the pleasure of eating.   My fiances got the boneless chicken bites. Those were cold, too.   I'm sure everything was just sitting there considering it took 30 minutes for our food to come out."}
{"text":"It is okay. The best thing to get there is the sampler. Other than that, it is a bar.   The service can be better.  Servers were missing personality which makes the a visit enjoyable."}
{"text":"Place has changed... walked in about a month ago and the manager was real nice and greeted us right away. Sat for 10 min with friends and no waitress came by. The manager came back by again and said someone would be with us. Another 8 min went by, so we ended up walking out. It's a shame because the food is pretty good, service needs to step it up. Someone could of easily taken our drink order!"}
{"text":"Went in the other day and it was my first time hearing that they were a private bar. I've been here about 5 other times through the year. I didn't want to sign any forms for membership that night, I just wasn't in the mood. As I was leaving the staff was kind enough to insult me with saying what kind of a person was I that I couldn't afford the membership. Well with attitude like that I won't ever consider spending my money here again. If the owners let the staff get away with this level of service then I suspect everything else is being neglected. I suggest you visit another bar before considering this place. There's plenty other spots with a lot friendlier staff in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We wandered in about 11:30 last night for some appetizers and drinks. Fox n Hound has a great laid back atmosphere!  I was so impressed with our service. For a busy bar our waitress was really attentive and we did not have to wait long for anything. Definitely a cool place to hang out!"}
{"text":"I'm not a person that takes time out of their busy schedule to write reviews, that is, unless I have received exceptional service or absolutely terrible,  here the service was terrific (hence the 2 star rating) but the food was the most disgusting garbage (which is where they may have fished it from) I have ever been served!  I ordered the Grilled Chicken and told the waitress \"I only want Lettuce, Tomato and Mayo\" she said \"okay, got it.\" and moved on to take my associates order (as if she understood and wrote down what I asked for..) well, let me tell you this thing came out a sopping wet mess! it was sitting in a half inch of some type of juice (not sure why) and it had cheese and mushrooms on it (which I am allergic) I had actually taken a bite and spit it out before realizing they were on there! It wasn't edible without the mushrooms! (wish I had taken a picture to post but didn't want to look like a nut in front of a guy I'm trying to sell a house to)  so.. I asked for a box as not to offend my business associate and threw it away as soon as I made it home!!!!! I love my wife too much to play a sick joke like that on her.. I must say I have always had exceptional service although, we do always have to ask a second time for sauces we order with our meals (ALWAYS!). Word of advice, Dump the Grilled Chicken!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night for a birthday dinner. Let me just say that this is the most disappointing service experience ever! We had a group of about 20 people with one waiter. She we never got any drink refills and no silverware. We had to get up to get our own silverware! But of course she didn't care about giving us service because they automatically charge a 18% gratitude on each ticket since it was a big group. The food wasn't all that great either. My burger was really dry. Overall, I will never go to this place by choice unless someone picks it as an event destination. *THUMBS DOWN*"}
{"text":"Horrible service, trashy enviornment, even trashier staff.... all around FAIL"}
{"text":"We have been going to this place for years. I was hesitant to continue because the last couple times it smelled like someone mopped with a sour mop. It still stinks. We were hungry so. We stayed. There was one other table occupied besides ours. It was 5:45 and this surprised me because they have $5 Grey goose martinis among other drink specials.  I ordered a dirty martini and water. I was brought a regular Martini. Whatever. Then we ordered. I ordered voodoo chicken with no bun and my husband ordered skirt steak tacos.  No where on the menu did it say the tacos were spicy. He does not eat spicy food, but I do. When our Oder came out, his taco \"skirt steak\" looked like the meat you get in those cheap Mexican dinners and it was so spicy it made MY eyes water (I can handle spicy, but this was ridiculous). The salsa that came with the tacos was really spicy, too. The chips would've been good if they hadn't had the equivalent of a salt lick on them. I started eating my voodoo chicken, but it wasn't chicken. It was a burger.  It had so much crap piled on it I didn't even know it wasn't chicken until I dug it out. I had to trade with my husband because he couldn't even eat his tacos. I think he saved me because he was sick from that night till the next day. They also had the music blaring so loud you couldn't even hear each other.  The ladies behind me asked for it to be turned down, but when the next shift manager came in he cranked it right back up and proceeded to walk around singing. No thanks. They have totally changed and shortened the menu in what I think is an attempt to save the restaurant. No way will it last. If you can't pack the place with the happy hour drink specials they have, your fate is sealed.  Waitress was fine but chatty except for messing up my drink and meal orders."}
{"text":"The service was slow even though it wasn't very busy; the floor was so dirty that my feet stuck to the floor; and a salesperson walked around the dining area trying to sell energy drinks. It was an odd experience, which is too bad because the burgers are very good."}
{"text":"Inconsistency is the only consistent thing about Bailey's.  I'm giving it 4 Stars because we have had far more good experiences than bad ones but you don't know quite what you're going to get when you go.  Food is generally good but it can be slow.  If you're hungry be sure to order some starters as soon as you arrive. They still might take 20+ minutes.  Wings, nachos, and other bar food is usually pretty consistent though there are exceptions.  Usually their chicken tenders are outstanding--among the best I have ever had.  However, sometimes they serve a substitute which are among the worst I have ever had.  Service is also hit and miss.  Even with a good waitress we find that they are \"gone\" far more than they are circulating.  They tend to congregate at the bar, particularly when things are slow.  Some are good at their job and seem to be competent and happy that they are in food service.  Others act like they despise being in food service and seem like they'd rather be doing ANYTHING other than waiting on the general public.  The place does need a really good clean-up and re-fresh.  The men's restroom is worse than any bowling alley or bus station I've ever been to.  It's the worst of any restaurant I've ever been to and has been for years.  It needs major repairs and cleaning.  Ideally it should be completely overhauled with completely new facilities, improved ventilation and some sort of deodorizer.  It seems to be undersized for the place and between that and apparent vandalism, it's always in poor shape.    I like the good experiences I have had at Baileys.  If they could fix and maintain the restroom and improve wait staff service they'd have a consistent 4 Star place on their hands."}
{"text":"Once a great place to grab a beer, bar food, and a game but unfortunately that was long ago. Lots of TVs, which is very good,  but that's about all this bar can brag about.  The food is subpar and the service,  though nice, is slow.  With Bad Daddy's, Bradshaw's,  and other places close by you won't be missing anything by passing on The Fox & The Hound."}
{"text":"Hated walking into a restaurant where  all around the entrance was a sea of cigarette butts--yuk! Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited 15 mins before our order was taken. Classic fall from grace. Other locations are far better. Skip this one. Go too Duckworth's across the street. If you like dive bars,  then this is perfect for you. I like dive bars, but they are on a whole different level. # disappointed"}
{"text":"Pool, beer and food. Nice combo!"}
{"text":"I live close and decided to stop by. The bartender was beyond rude and the inside smelled like throw up in a old gym shoe but the beer was cold and the outside seating was decent. There are many bars and restaurants in this area...I would NEVER advise anyone to pick this one."}
{"text":"After playing the \"I don't know what I want for dinner what do you want\" game with my friends we decided to visit Bailey's Sports Grille. We were excited that we could get some good food and play some pool, darts or cornhole. The food was pretty good and the service was great. We spent several hours at Baileys and really had a great time. I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I usually hit this place on Mondays for their lunch special.  The burger and fries are some of the best I've ever had but the wait is what kills it.  I've never been in there and gotten my food in less than 45 minutes, going to lunch here usually takes about an hour fifteen.  The waitresses are also friendly but stay at the bar, a couple times I've had to go up front to get their attention so I can pay and leave."}
{"text":"Bartenders are fantastic food is above average fun atmosphere. Always have a good time when I come here."}
{"text":"Not a bad place of been in Ballantyne forever. One of the original Ballin time hotspots you kick around here decent wings very good beer and the staff is decent parking can be a bad."}
{"text":"Madison and Brittany are the best bartenders you have. You can tell they know what they are doing and have the years of experience in this store. If I don't see either one of them When I walk in the door I leave. You need more people like them and I hope the new Management knows that."}
{"text":"Disappointed in this place. I wanted to take my wife out for dinner . But they charge $10.00 for a stupid UFC fight. Nice way to lose business."}
{"text":"Except for the beer selection and hot waitresses, this place is all around mediocre.  Food, atmosphere, location, prices - subpar.  Redeeming points:  Beer selection. Decent beers on tap, with nice bottle selection. Waitresses. Decent girls I'd like to tap, with nice cans."}
{"text":"That place smells like throw up, bad service, they measure the amount of alcohol if the bartender does not know you, and if they know you then your getting your money worth, horrible food, needs a lot of updates, they are still in the 90's, great beer selection"}
{"text":"Came on Sunday for all day football.  Food was decent but the bartender took forever to refill drinks.  And also not one buy back after being there the entire day.  Also the setup of the TV's isn't good.  No matter where you sit you can only see 4 or 5 TV's so you're missing 3 or 4 football games.  I'm in no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"I have maybe had good service at this Fox and Hound once, and still come back every now and then but this evening was the worst. I waited about 10-15 minutes to be greeted. In that time period the whole staff was ooing and awing over a small puppy in the office. Um aren't pets not allowed in restaurants/bars? I know service animals are but a small puppy that can't even be put down to walk on their own is a service dog?   The food took awhile and according to my boyfriend it was sitting in the window for a very long time.  The last straw was waiting to leave. It took the longest time to get our waitress attention to get the check and then once we did have he check I noticed her at a pool table checking out a male guests tattoos on his back. He had his shirt off and she was touching his back tattoo. I guess he was more important then her guests?   Absolutely horrible. If you like Fox and Hound go to the one in Ballentyne instead."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. To start...we ordered and the waitress didn't write it down so she came back and asked us 5 times what we ordered. When we got our food it was wrong... imagine that! The burger was supposed to be plain and it came smothered in mayo. The manager came over and made some excuses. The burger came out almost 20 minutes later with a cold bun?!?!   I took a chance and tried their philly with cheez-whiz?!? Worst choice ever! GROSS! The manager did take it off even though he definitely didn't have to since I knew what was on it.  This place would be ideal for Sunday funday. Lots of drink specials, pool tables, and a few arcade style games.   To sum it up...don't eat here....just drinks!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop by if you're in the North Lake Area and wanted a bite.  The ULTIMATE PLATTER is a awesome way to venture into finger food. For those of you who's a bit thirsty try the TOP SHELF LONG ISLAND ICED TEA!  If you're not much of a bar sitter try the activity room!  Lauren the server there is awesome!  Exceptional costumer service!"}
{"text":"Service started off a bit slow but in the end it was fairly good.  They also couldn't figure out our appetizer of nachos, but wanting the chips on the side.  They came out with small bowls with each ingrediant seperate.  We ended up mixing it ourselves because they claimed they don't have bowls...  The salads came out in bowls a few minutes later.  I'm also not sure I would call them Mile High Nachos but that could be because we got the chips on the side.  Overall though the food itself was good.  My burger had a ton of flavor.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their tacos, and panini.  Good place to watch a game and get some food or for lunch.  I'd prob go back."}
{"text":"WEAK drinks. Emphasis on the \"WEAK.\" And rude staff. Will not return. Their bitchy bartenders even yelled at my friend as we were walking out because he had told them the drinks were weak. Really? No class at this place."}
{"text":"I live right next to Birkdale and used to go to Fox and Hound but alas, they have elected to post against lawful concealed carry. So now I take my business across the street to the Red Rocks Café."}
{"text":"The bartender on thanksgiving night didn't do last call and ran our card without asking. Man that's what I was looking for after a long hectic holiday.not...I respect you guys for being open but damn....."}
{"text":"Don't sit at a table with employees that are off the clock and drinking. I sat in a seat with a table of some of them, I was asked to leave the table because they had a couple more people coming. There were no reserve signs on the table or on the open seats. One of the servers that wasn't working was really drunk and yelling at me to leave. I told every one I would sit some where else when their other friends showed up. One of the more reasonable employees at the table told me not to worry that they were all going bar hopping any way. I told him I would sit else where if it was going to be a such a big deal, once again he told me not to worry about it.  I was just sitting there watching football and the manager came out, I told him how his drunk employee was yelling at me. Here's the unbelievable part, he told me I was banned from the bar.  Note- I was a regular there, pretty much every night. I believe throwing me out was directed by their district manager who has horrendous customer service skills. Not the manager that was on who is a pretty good guy.  Bottom line. Party some where else. No one should be treated this way!"}
{"text":"By far the worst managed restaurant/ bar in the North Charlotte area. They have a Bartender that will treat you like crap, she rubs off on their other servers.  Management does nothing to control her. There's a reason for that, that I won't get into.  I highly suggest Hickory Tavern off of Harris Blvd,. exit 18.. They appreciate your business and treat you great!  If you want to go to a Fox and Hound, go to their Birkdale location, exit 25 off of I-77 North. It is very well managed and it's obvious they appreciate your business."}
{"text":"It's great to sit here cuz atmosphere to drink... But service sucks.. I was waiting for server after I finish my beer for long time"}
{"text":"Last time I was here was 07' Hasn't changed A Bit Sure nice overpriced place to bring a date but on a Saturday evening the bar was dead. All that was there was a series of bartenders who kept asking me over and over again would I like to order. Not an exaggeration I said hold off 4 times and I had a water in front of me, obviously I'm trying to look around before I commit. On number 5 I asked the bartender would you like me to rent this spot? Then left. Take a hint and use your mind. They were trying to play like they were offering top notch customer service but the undertone was buy something or get out. No its not an exaggerated tale I've never been asked to order so many times ever anywhere."}
{"text":"Best place in Pineville. Great food drinks with daily specials. The bartenders and servers are the best. Luv it here."}
{"text":"Only got a one because the food was good.  Waitress was completely absent and the manager refused to change the game even though every patron on the patio wanted to see a different game.  Lousy time."}
{"text":"10/28 lunch. Bad wings.  Used to be my favorite in town!  Sierra Nevada keg was stale.  Server is non responsive!  I won't come back. Ok gm erik came out and apologized for the visit.  Not sure it sunk in to him.  No offer to credit bad food.  He is short staffed I guess? I'll love to spend 50 on lunch somewhere else."}
{"text":"Service leaves a lot to be desired as we had to wave to get service several times (this happened last time we were here but we just chalked it up to a one off event).  They were all just chatting in the back for about 15 minutes.  We planned on having our weekly meetings here but we are changing the venue.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I ordered \"to go\"  tonight and was stunned at the incompetence of whoever answered the phone. \"I'm sorry\" seems to be THE ONLY thing they aren't out of and may possibly have been the girl's name on the other line. Or....maybe she thought \"I'm sorry\" was my name? I paid $15 and change for a buffalo chicken sandwhich (minus the buffalo sauce????), and two sides. I had been charged extra for bleu cheese dressing (which was actually ranch dressing mixed with a hint of bleu cheese dressing no actual crumbles) as I was told after confirming my order and paying that they were out of blue cheese crumbles..... Ugh. Fine fine fine! Until I get home and find wilted brown lettuce and a slice of gelatinous tomato garnishing this travesty. I took pictures. Eew. In addition to a watered down cola and cold limp fries this overall experience will be completely avoided by me never entering  any of these establishments. Ever. Never again."}
{"text":"The service had begun to lack, but it appears they've hired some new servers and the past couple times I was here, I never had an empty beer. Chelsa did an exceptional job both times I've had her as a server"}
{"text":"I have decided to start writing reviews to restaurants that have come up short....and this place does, consistently.  They need to train their staff, first and foremost.  They need to stop offering football pools to patrons and start concentrating on putting edible food on the tables.  We ordered coffee and it was served cold a couple of times to different people---don't know much about making coffee based alcoholic drinks---not impressed with the food at all."}
{"text":"What an absolute joke of experience. My Fiancé and I came from Montana and when getting checked at the door they said it was North Carolina State Law that they couldn't take out of state ID's. To make it better the creepy door guy hit on me as he looked at my ID. Then we proceeded to tell them that other fox and hound locations have let us in and they told us they didn't want to start on all the other sketchy things other locations do!? What kind of business can't hire managers who have half a brain, let alone have employees that bad mouth other locations of the same business. 2.5 stars is a pipe dream for this place."}
{"text":"Fox & Hound is one of my favorite bar chains in Charlotte, they are geared towards watching sports, offering decent bar food, good drink specials, and entertaining events.  We are regulars here on Thursday nights for the live trivia, also because it is $2 domestic and $2.50 imports night.  The wait staff are friendly and cute, our favorite server at this Northlake store is Fran, she is friendly, fast, and remembered my drink of choice after only my first week there.  The beer selection is above average for your average sports bar, lot of choices in imports, including a couple of my favs Smithwicks and Boddingtons.  Besides live trivia on Thursdays, we have seen Jello Wrestling (check photos), Bikini contests, Karaoke (Sundays and Tuesdays), and various themed holiday celebrations.  Make sure you join the FREE All Star Brew club, after only 50 beers you get half price wings for life.  There are a lot of other benefits as well, including free appetizer parties each month.  It is valid at all Fox and Hounds in the US and Bailey's and Champs restaurants as well.  If trivia on Thursday brings you here come early, it starts at 9 but bar will be filled up by then.  P.S.  The bathrooms have mouthwash dispensers if you find yourself going overboard with the Spicy garlic wings!"}
{"text":"I was there the other day during a game I had an hour to kill, so have a couple beers and some wings and relax before I go home.....I ordered the wings right away...sat there....sat there...Sat there....the bartender short brunette was rude most of the time, I finally said to her (after 45min) I have to go just take the wings off and she gave me attitude, took them off wouldnt get me change I waited (almost just walked out) --then she brought out the wings \"there done\" you want them to go (bitchy voice). I said sure. she charged me for the wings ( I thought shouldnt have happened)  I waitied again to pay -- IT WAS LIKE MY FAULT the kitchen known for wings can not get them out faster than 45min for 10 wings - she acted like it was my fault  I left feeling horrible. She was awful and should not be working in hospitality. Mayfield heights location...BTW -- FYI -- hire people that are friendly not ones that think their hot and their not."}
{"text":"I do not CARE what anyone else may say, and I know that I am just one voice, but this place FEAKN rocks!! comn from LA I can find a sports bar pretty much on every corner, and yes they all serve the same comfort food, and moving here has been a bit of a challenge trying to find 1 a comfort food that's good, and 2 a place that shows the events, in particular, the fights. and this place HAS NEVER LET ME DOWN!!  so i had to write if nothing else to say I LOVE this place!!  I truly appreciate the fact that you guys keep the patron in mind and not act like the rest of the spots out here and show what's \"hot at the moment\", that's how you gain loyal customers like myself. so this is a WOOHOO from me! I haven't written a post in a minute cause nothing has moved me too...until now! Oh and the food is really good!!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that the food is not terrible (nothing interesting or special, but better than wet newspaper.)  The servers are hit and miss, although our last server was actually very good.    I'm giving this place one star because the atmosphere is trashy, loud, aggressive, and dirty.  I went into the mens room, and there was vomit all over the floor.  I told a server, who gave me a nasty look and then ignored me.    So all in all, this is a great bar to watch an MMA fight and drink jaeger till you puke in a urinal, but not so great for adults."}
{"text":"Hey, try not hiring worthless bartenders. Or just close, the area would be better off."}
{"text":"EDIT: The music has definitely been toned down, and we love it!   Fox and Hound has a GREAT menu, AWESOME drink specials, and WONDERFUL service. The one thing that sincerely bothers my and my group of friends is the couple nights (namely $2 Tuesday) that the music is so loud and so full of bass that we can't even hear ourselves think! We unfortunately can't hold a conversation with one another, which is a bummer because we really love everything else about the establishment. We recently left the bar earlier than we wanted to because the music was so loud. It's strange to us because its not as if $2 Tuesdays are advertised as a dancing night. Would love if they toned the music on the nights that they offered irresistible drink specials!"}
{"text":"Lunch on Sunday afternoon was blah. Chili wasn't even warm when it came out and tasted like straight chili powder. The French dip had no flavor whatsoever. Our server was great but that was about it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The wings are very good.  Their burgers are very good.  Their beer prices are fair.  The service in there is very good.  It is a good place for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon to watch football games.  Caroline is an incredible bar tender.  She makes a TREMENDOUS vodka martini  TREMENDOUS"}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to the Northlake Mall area and to Fox and Hound Pub & Grille.   This tavern features typical sports bar food, including chicken wings, fish n chips, and burgers.  Dora here. Early birds again. Instead of closing the bars, we open them. :)  Because of that, service was attentive and the food arrived before I guzzled half my iced tea.  The Biergarten pretzels, two baked and salted Bavarian-style pretzels with a side of queso were soft, not overly salty, and the queso kicked in a good way.  I ordered the Blackened Fish Tacos, cod fillets with coleslaw, cilantro-lime sour cream and pickled red onions.   These tacos were great. The spices on the fish and the freshness of the coleslaw caused the whole taco to work together. My only regret with these tacos is the cilantro-lime favor should be more prominent.   Dora here. I. Love. Chili. So if a restaurant offers chili nachos on a menu, I'm all over it. But these Nacho Muchos were mucho on the cheese, slim on the chili. No layers of flavor, in some spots globs of cheese. Cheese lovers will be in heaven with this nacho platter, but I prefer a bit more...beef. I salivated over tasting the lime sour cream, but that didn't materialize. Overall, good nachos, but didn't quite quench my chili taste bud.    We rate this restaurant 3 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving good food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"The worst. Dont know how this place is still in business. Been there 2x in 5 years and had really bad experiences both times. What are the odds? First time I told the manager my food was over cooked and he said \"your perception is your reality\". What? 2nd time a week ago, we went arly so were one of the few people in there. An hour goes by and the restaurant fills. Still no food. Table that ce after us got served 1st. Half our meals, table of 6, got bad tasting food or just blah. Manager his time, after i complained, was nice enough to take care of our meals. Wish this place would close down so a decent place can"}
{"text":"There are a ton of other places very similar to this everywhere, lots of beer, lots of TV's, lots of bar games, lots of (really) hot girls.  If that's what you're looking for, this place could be a five.  I think it would be perfect next to campus, or in a hip, younger area.  This place gets packed, and I went there for a low key drink after work to find it literally packed at 10 PM on a Tuesday, and this place is HUGE.  Turns out $2 drafts all day really gets the people in the door, and doesn't make them ever want to leave.  I have been here before though, and its usually pretty expensive on the drinks.  There are as mentioned a lot of really attractive girls working up here, which seems to be the main draw on most nights, and certainly hasn't kept me away.  The food is pretty standard, nothing has been terrible, but I've never thought \"man I need to go back and get those...\".  They do have UFC fights, but there's a $5 cover charge usually.  If you can get away with it great, but I think if your drinking, they should kinda stop charging at the door as well.  If you are a single guy or girl looking for someone, you should stop by, just realize its a meat market, might be fun, but thats probably all it is."}
{"text":"Thank you Matt for reminding me about this blah establishment that I had forgotten to review. Not that I have much of anything else to add. I went here after work one day for a \"happy hour\" (although for me, any work-organized get-together where I can't drink is not really happy for me.)  Still, I guess I am glad I didn't waste any money on overpriced mixed drinks or bud light here. They did have a rather good Cobb salad but it wasn't enough to save this place from the general doldrums it represents."}
{"text":"Went to Baileys about a week ago to celebrate my birthday with some friends. There were four of us and two of us got up from the table to use the restroom. When we came back my best friends iPhone was no longer on the table. In a panic, we are looking around the table and around us and looking at the people that were at the tables near us - it was no where to be found. Thanks to \"Find my iPhone\" - the iPhone turned up in our waitresses back pocket. The manager came out and the waitress swore up and down that she had no idea how it got there. The manager let us know that she was going to let her go that night if the story stuck. The waitress got out of that one and still has her job somehow after trying to steal a customer's phone.   HATE Bailey's. I can understand that a customer is not always right - but when a customer's phone ends up in the servers back pocket - some action needs to be taken.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because the food is above average. It's the service that absolutely sucks out loud. I've been here 3 times in the past 6 months and all three times I have had to go find a waitress to take my order. That's a direct reflection on the management (or lack thereof). I paid a $5 cover each for my wife and I on May 5 to be served above average food with almost non-existent service. I liked this place when it was Bailey's. And other Fox and Hound's have been pretty good. Definitely need a change in management at this location and the wait staff needs to be completely retrained on what good customer service is."}
{"text":"I will start positive, the food is always good. But.... the prices are a little much for it to be bar food, also the service is atrocious. If you plan to go during lunch and need to be back within an hour, skip this place! Went today with four coworkers and it took over an hour with two other tables. Poor waitress told it was her second day. She was handling all the tables alone, even forgot to take one of our peoples orders after taking the entire table. The really sad part is that she was not alone, but was the only one working. Two others were too busy playing connect four and talk on their cell phone on speaker. We rarely go for this exact reason. Can't say we will return anytime soon."}
{"text":"This bar is disappointing.  Been to a Fox and Hound in Erie, Pa and it was great.  The food is just as good, but the bar layout is strange and there's only one pool table (only pool in Ballantyne).   Same specials and I can always find a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"I love this location! Everyone that works here is pretty awesome. Great wings (hot extra crispy) $2 Drafts on Tuesdays, DJs and karaoke! The servers and bartenders are very observant and helpful."}
{"text":"I went in yesterday for the first time to watch the UFC fight.  We had a great time.  The chicken and chili nachos were amazing and a huge portion that my boyfriend and I shared and let 2 other people eat!   The pool tables were nice too.  We played an hour worth of pool for $10.  My only problem is the it was so hot outside that the kegs were messed up so we couldn't get draft beers and had to get bottles. And since there was a fight there were a lot of people and service was slow.   Our waitress was working with our table and lots of separate tabs but when she would bring someone a drink she wouldn't think to ask if anyone needed anything. She did a great job other than that because we sat at a table, moved to the pool tables, then went back to a different table and she found us every time and was very kind!"}
{"text":"We wanted to grab a quick dinner and were looking forward to the specials tonight: half price wine bottles and half price appetizers before 6 pm. The food tasted okay, but the service was horrible. They were out of the Kris pinot grigio on the menu, so our server brought out a different wine. When we asked how much it costed, she did not know. She then told us that it was more expensive, but it was the cheapest wine they had. There were several cheaper bottles on the menu, but none were available on half price wine night. Hmm.   She then brought the bottle to our table and didn't even bother to pour the wine into our glasses. Our food was brought to us in to-go boxes. Not sure why?? She said it was because we had said that we were in a hurry. The corn dog appetizer was burned. I ordered chicken nachos, and they came with no chicken. The manager was friendly and apologetic, but I don't think we'll be going back. It's no wonder the bar was empty."}
{"text":"Found out today... another couple we are familiar with attended this same event .       Guess what...They weren't asked to preauthorize anything, nor were they asked    for their method of payment.        SO MUCH FOR CLAIMING THAT IT'S (THE B.S.) POLICY!!!"}
{"text":"Averie Ennis is the best waitress. She is friendly and loved to interact with customers.   Always kept our drinks filled, with a smile on her face. Deff will come to this location again just to have her serve us!"}
{"text":"Is it bad that I have never eaten the food here? Given that fact, my review is based solely on the atmosphere, the beer, and the service. Should I ever have occasion to try the food, I will make certain to do an update.  The atmosphere: Typical sports bar full of the stereotypical patrons. You've got plenty of young girls that get more and more tipsy as the evening goes on, and you've got guys in polo shirts who are there to prey on those girls as they become less and less concerned with appearances. You can tell that many of them are regulars and the place is casual enough that I can see how it would be easy to become a regular.   The beer: Great beer selection with $2 drafts on Tuesdays. You read that correctly. All pints are two bucks on Tuesdays! You can't go to a bar and get a can of PBR for that cheap anymore!   The service: At the bar, very good! Especially considering that the noise level is so high that they practically need to lean over the bar to hear your order.  As a whole: It's hard to beat that Tuesday special. If we find ourselves in Birkdale on a Tuesday, we will definitely drop by but I can't see us choosing Fox and Hound Birkdale as a destination."}
{"text":"Updating from a prior review - this was a favorite spot for us to stop for a couple drinks (lots of TVs, decent atmosphere) with 2 main perks being the All Star Club which we had a high enough status to get tall drafts for the price of small drafts, and their Tuesday special of all drafts $2.  As of this week they changed to the MVP club which has no perks for discounts and the $2 drafts are now $2, $3 and $4.  All the \"good\" beers are going to fall into the 3-4 range.  May not seem like a lot, but it was the draw to come here on Tuesdays.  For reference, you should check across the street for Bad Daddy's or Brixx as they will have better specials.  We will certainly be doing so from now on."}
{"text":"I have visited the Ballantyne location for over a year and I have noticed fewer and fewer people visiting over the last year and I didn't understand why until last night.  Some of the patrons were loud, had too much to drink, and were using a lot of foul language.  It's ashame because I enjoy the food - just not its customers"}
{"text":"The bartender made a passion fruit Long Island iced tea..... super delicious!!!!! I wish I could remember his name because he was awesome. He was all over the place serving everyone and not one person went without a drink for longer than a minute or two. AND the music selection they had going was great too. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Here for a corporate event.  Food was better than expected.  Service was fair.  The place was really loud.  From the hotel pans, the best bite had to be the wings.  The chicken was not overcooked and still moist.  Crispy skin too.  The buffalo sauce had a little tang to it but not much heat.  Bleu cheese dressing on the side was largely devoid of any chunks of cheese.    Honorable mention goes to the spinach & artichoke dip.  A little better than the Costco variety but the chips were a bit salty and that made the dish.  So-so ribs and cheese sticks.  The soft pretzels weren't a very good choice as they dried out pretty quickly on the buffet.  The bar cheese sauce that was with them but this offering may be better suited to table service than a group gathering.  Good beer list.  Lots of draft options."}
{"text":"The food at Fox and Hound is pretty awful, even accepting that its a bar and you typically don't have high expectations. But this food is especially awful -- like microwave dinner-quality. We used to go there to watch football games, but never again. We haven't been back in several years."}
{"text":"Great deals on beer on Tuesdays.  Sometimes the service is a little slow, but the food and drinks are good.  Also lots of pool tables, a ping pong table, and a shuffle board table.  Great place to go with friends."}
{"text":"This is a good bar to go to for a little sports and a few drinks, and the food isn't horrible. I simply would not come here with my main goal being to have dinner. It is your typical bar food, which is expected and the service is a hit-or-miss."}
{"text":"We ordered two appetizers and two side salads on a Sunday when the place was basically empty and we had to pull aside someone (not our server) to ask where our salads were after about 25 minutes. Then received our food, wings were gross dried out little turds and although my friend liked her hummus I thought it was weird and chunky. I was so annoyed by the indifference of the staff here that I would never go back. Drive a few more exits and go to Duckworths, I mean it"}
{"text":"Good place to watch the game and have a burger or salad.  You can watch several games at once if you sit in the right location.  The ice tea is a good drink if you do not want a beer.  Bring lots if friend to gave a good time."}
{"text":"OH SWEET LORD BABY JESUS worst service ever! Understandably it's July 4th and even though the birkdale area was busy, the restaurant wasn't. Majority of the seating in the front of the house was occupied, but the bar and back areas were empty. They were adequately staffed with service personnel, but must have been short handed in the kitchen as food was barely making its way out.  We got our drinks fast enough and then proceeded to wait 45 minutes for food that never came. Nothing complex, 2 kids meals and 2 sandwich adult meals. We watched as other tables suffered the same non-service.  Needless to say we hopefully chucked enough money down to cover our drinks and walked across to Red Rocks where we ordered food, drinks and had our meal within 20 minutes. Great meal at Red Rocks we will bypass Fox & Hound for future reference."}
{"text":"the first thing I noticed when I walked in was that it smelled like sewage. the waitresses seemed bothered that we had walked in to actually sit at table not the bar. when I ordered, I asked if they could add salmon to the Caesar salad and she said yes without hesitation. 5 minutes later she came back and said 'we only have cod. would that work?' I quickly changed my order to buffalo wings. the sauce was mediocre and one wing (boneless) was actually just breading.  my debit card had been deactivated due to fraudulent activity and I was unaware. the waitress came back and handed my friend their check to sign and then turned to me and said 'and yours has been declined, so like, what do you plan on doing?' luckily I have multiple methods of payment but this server just lacked tact or sensitivity."}
{"text":"This place is your typical sports bar... A ton of TVs and pool tables. If you are sports fan, this is where you want to go to watch your favorite games. UFC Fights are shown with a $5 cover. If you are a fan of Fox and Hound and their food, you will live this place as they are from the same group.  We experienced very good service on my most recent trip. Does this place have something that will make me want to become a regular? No, but it's a nice spot to watch a special sports event or share a few drinks as there isn't a plethora of bar options in the Ballantyne area. I'm giving it 3 stars because I wasn't wowed or found myself clamoring to come back."}
{"text":"Menu has improved and expanded in the last few months.  Thank goodness.. I hate to say this but their french fries are insanely good.  Good number of beer offerings although they tend to run out of drafts."}
{"text":"Welp, I live right across the street from  here- I will agree with some of the other posts about this place, basically average menu/ foods found at most chains and service depends on what you get. Many drinks equaled great service, hanging out for a simple bite? Not too attentive. That proved something to me, I haven't ran back to the place because of this. The people seem nice,  they just make it obvious what they're there for... and it isn't you!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service i have ever  seen. I have sat for  30 plus minutes before i was greeted and served"}
{"text":"I guess this is your new typical giant suburban sports bar. There is nothing about this place which is particularly interesting including the beer choices and the food choices. The service was good once we got past the ineptitude and confusion at the front door. They were trying to charge us a ten dollar cover charge because there was some kind of fight on the TV. As if i care."}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be an awesome bar.  Sadly after a few times being there i honestly don't think it would get better. I do give props to 1 bartender but that's about it. As far as music and drinks it's very mediocre, the service from the \"servers\" is extremely horrible. God for bid they'd actually have to pay attention to their customers.  I rarely do  reviews for bars but i feel like I'd have to get it out some way because it was obvious that my server being rude and inattentive was not going to get noticed by the manager. After getting a pool table and waiting a good 30 mins to get food and drink order our server finally came. Placed our drink and food order and completely rushed it out of us as if she had a time limit to get the order in \"10 pm on Friday\". When we finally got our food we realized she forgot our nachos after finishing all of our food. We told her she forgot our nachos thinking maybe it was already made and she can just run it to us but she just went and put the order in. And before that i asked for  simple glass of water she looked at me dead in the eye and said \"sure I'll grab that\", but then continued to go sit at her own table with co workers to eat and dance to the god awful music they had playing. I really wanted to like this place because of the amount of pool tables they have but the servers could use a whole lot of common sense and training."}
{"text":"Do not go here if you want to watch a specific sporting event. Sitting in a half empty bar with one game on 6 TVs (out of 14) the manager refused to turn ANY of the TVs to the game we asked for. Watching a game on our phone in a Sports Bar is stupid. Lousy service."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. I'm surprised it's still open. It has to be the alcohol and location . The food is a mess. Wings deformed with lots of feathers.  You would think living chickens were in the kitchen. You don't get what you paid for either.  The cooks must drink too. Horrible customer service. I'll never get there again. Hope it has changes for the better."}
{"text":"Ahh Bailey's. What was once a solid neighborhood bar for my friends and I to have a few beers, shoot some pool, and socialize has turned into something far different. The drinks haven't changed much, the pool tables are still plentiful, and the servers are still friendly (for the most part). So, you're probably wondering why the sudden change of heart about this place. Well, Bailey's recently underwent a change of management due to the former one getting transferred. Things sure went downhill after that! They are simply trying WAY too hard to lure in customers now. DJs, bands, unnecessary events, most of which nobody cares about are a regular occurrence here. This wouldn't be too big of an issue, but you have to pay a cover for these! And that is just annoying. Bailey's, you just need to keep it simple! Stick with alcohol and pool, ditch the new frills, and I'll be back then."}
{"text":"I mean it's a sports bar/ pool hall....so I got exactly what I expected to get:   Cheap Beer and Bar Food.   As previous reviews have mentioned the service is inconsistent at best but they offer a pretty decent size menu. We only ordered some wings and they were okay. But the good news is that they do have a pretty decent selection of  sauces to chose from!   There's plenty of tv's if you're there for a sporting event and pool tables and dart boards in the back. They've got plenty of parking and daily drink specials so if all that sounds good to you then this is definitely the place to be!"}
{"text":"Other than the beer selection this place leaves alot to be desired. Over the past few years their food has really gone down hill. I used to enjoy having there pot roast sliders but even the sliders have gone downhill. For bar food you really can get much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks, yes.  But beware of your valuables and the staff.  I attended a charity event here over the holidays and left behind an expensive jacket.  Fortunately I was able to have someone find it and place aside with my name attached.  When I came to pick it up, I was told that someone else with my same (extremely rare and ethnic mind you) name had already done so.  Seems to be statistically impossible - but pairing this with another event that occurred within our group this now seems to make sense.  One of the patrons of our group hosting the fundraiser exchanged phone numbers with a female server.  He received a call from a Cleveland area phone number in the AM and to his surprise it was that same server calling him asking if he could bail her out of jail in Beachwood (multiple calls received that morning)!  Unbelievable!  I come here yearly when I'm back in town for the holidays but never again - extremely shady place.  No offer to refund the jacket or reprimand the staff in regards to either stealing or passing along the item to a random person."}
{"text":"Great place to any day and time specially to watch a game We always go there for the best nachos in town (chicken and chill) and BBQ Ribs...We also take advantage of the all star card so every special day free entree reward. Me and my family always have a great time to lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Atomosphere was nice, menu selection was so-so.  Service at the bar was atrocious.  Girls spent more time strutting back and forth (nice, but not when you are waiting to order food) behind the bar."}
{"text":"This place is way overrated. As a group of four, we ordered an appetizer that had mozzarella sticks, tater skins, pretzels, and wings. I will say, the pretzels were really yummy! That was the only good thing about the visit. The rest of the appetizer was average. I ordered the chicken Capri sandwich and found it very bland (what basil pesto?). In fact, I didn't even eat half of the sandwich. And the cheese on sweet potato fries was just weird. The service was AWFUL. We waited 15 minutes before the waitress took our drink order and that was pretty consistent throughout the meal. Even paying the bill was a hassle...she never asked us how we wanted to do the bill, so she spent 20 minutes fixing it. Then after we paid, she took another 20 minutes to come back with receipts or change. Also, I know it's a sports bar type restaurant, however, you don't need to turn up the volume so incredibly loud that I can't hear the person sitting directly beside me. I would definitely not go back."}
{"text":"Was so pleasant with our party of 8 (including 3 kids). The food was good; the sausage dog with onions and peppers looked amazing! Would rec. this for casual dining with kids or a group of adults wanting to see every game on!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to three Fox and Hound's in the area (Northlake, Uptown, Huntersville). This location tries to have a more upscale pub  feel. The service here is always excellent. The food is usually decent. I love getting the balsamic chicken flat bread and the pretzel bites with pub cheese are good. However, the steak salad is kinda yucky. I would avoid anything with steak here as it is very chewy and has a bad texture. 3.5 stars for food, 5 stars for service. This is usually a satisfying option and a good place to drink."}
{"text":"This was a regular stop for me when I lived in Mayfield behind the bar in the high rise apartments. This bar offered a decent beer selection and had pretty good food. They had pool tables which kept us occupied for a while. The crowd was always friendly and every once in a while I would run into friends because this was a pretty popular spot. The place is big so there was always room and plenty of seating. I can actually remember when it first opened to give you an idea when I was a regular. Nice to see the doors are still open."}
{"text":"We were in today around 4 and had courtney as are waitress ! She was fantastic ! Our food was delicious ! Service awesome ! We visit every 6 months when i go to Hillcrest Hospital and the fox and hound is always the best ! Thank You !"}
{"text":"Gross food, terrible service, and a not so great atmosphere. Had to get up and walk to the front to even get our server's attention, she disappeared for about 30 minutes at a time. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a place that opens late on Sundays. We had some friends in from out of town and couldn't figure out what to do aside from the usual eating. One of my friends suggested Bailey's. I've never been, but was pretty excited to play pool again. I haven't played in years!  Bailey's was PACKED! I didn't expect such a big crowd, but it was pretty saturated with what looked like college students. It kinda made me feel old and out of place lol Nonetheless the environment was very relaxed with open mic for karaoke and corn hole outside. The location is very spacious so despite the crowd, the wait for a pool table was not long at all. The food was pretty decent. We ordered wings, chicken tenders and fries (typical bar food) while we played. Prices for drinks/beer were reasonable. They have daily specials so check them out!  Overall, a great hangout place.. especially when everything else closes at 9."}
{"text":"It was just ok. I had a \"Capri panini\" which is basically a grilled chicken sandwich with cheese, spinach, basil pesto, and sundried tomato mayonnaise. The sandwich was decent, but the fries were awful- super soggy. My husband had the wings and he said they were just ok.  I'm not sure that we would come back for any reason."}
{"text":"Great service. Food arrived to table hot and good! Beer was cold! That's a big win! Far too many pubs serve warm beer in warm glasses. Geez! We will definitely be back. Nice variety of music playing in the background. TV's on the walls. Really good atmosphere"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I have eaten at Fox & Hound. I must say it was not a good experience. There were only two waitresses working. The male restroom wasn't clean. The sink area was untidy and low soap. I watched the bar tender run fingers through her hair while fixing drinks. The waitresses along with the manager rubbed their faces, ears, and noses, which I thought was unsanitary. I will give them credit for the food. My burger was good."}
{"text":"was here for a job function.....my managers were told that we could stay and watch the fight for free...they even double checked before they left......then after they left we were then told that we could stay and watch the fight at a discounted rate........was unable to find the lady who my manager spoke with. Then went there a month later only to be totally ignored by our waitress.....we sat there for 10 minutes before we got up and walked out"}
{"text":"The food was okay but the service was absolutely horrible. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich which was good, and sweet potato fries which I'm sure would have been good if they weren't burned and cold. The waitress, I can't remember her name, was one of the worst I have ever had. We should've just gotten a refund and left, but I was there to celebrate someone's birthday. I will DEFINITELY not ever be going back."}
{"text":"Oh black forest pretzel sandwich, how I love you!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Fox & Hound once before for lunch and it was ok.  I have been several times with co-workers for bevvies & appetizers after work and that was cool.  However, the other day, 2 co-workers and I went for lunch and the experience made me wish we had gone to McAlisters or Bad Daddy's instead of F&H.    First off, since the weather was nice, we sat outside. Unfortunately, we could smell the dumpsters from our table, so we asked to move.  After we moved, it took FOREVER for our server to come back to get our drink orders.  Finally she did, and we put in our order for an appetizer and our entrees.  We waited for a ridiculous amount of time before we saw our server again... and the restaurant was not even busy! So, when we finally did our server again, it was for the delivery of our entrees.  (Somebody forgot to put in the order for the appetizer!)  So, I might be willing to overlook the less than desirable service if the food was really good, but when my entree came out, it was meh.    I might come here again for late night drinks after dinner, but I will pass on eating here again."}
{"text":"Zero stars. We came in on a game day . Wasn't too crowded, all things considered. Plenty of empty big tables .... should have been a warning. I ordered a beer and received one the was horribly flat and bitter. Received a replacement which was supposed to be a pale ale but was clearly an amber. I decided not to try again since it wasn't ever going to be corrected. We had some queso which seemed ok but was probably dumped from a jar and dropped into the mini cast iron pan. I ordered a bbq pizza, which was terrible. The chicken was unevenly cooked. The pizza was burnt and SO salty. Seriously, how do you make a pizza so salty???? My friend ordered wings but they came out in the wrong flavor. We had an order of pretzels, which were so so. If we just had beer and pretzels then we would have been fine, overall. This last trip to Fox is a reminder why I haven't been to this place in a number of years."}
{"text":"customer service was not so good. Had 3 different waiters come to the table. One of which didn't put in an order so we waited 30+ mins for food that was never even coming. And no one came back to check if everything was set. When they did come back they didn't take our finished dishes or refill water."}
{"text":"So so sad was one of my favorite places when we came here a couple of years ago really wonder what happen we are here on Friday night no one here sad We sat a bar poor service wine tasteless"}
{"text":"Fun for a drink and TV sports but for food, not so much.   Have tried twice now.   The French Dip sandwich was last time.  And I do mean \"last time\".  Rubbery, over-processed meat (possibly beef) on a bun that had clearly been microwaved.  $13 for this creation that I could only stand to eat less than half of.  My very friendly and attentive bar maid seemed to go out of her way NOT to ask \"how was it?\" when she picked up the plate. I won't say that I won't go back, but it will be awhile and will likely be solely for beverages or bar snacks.  There are so many better choices in Birkdale and surrounding."}
{"text":"Even on a weekend lunch it's noisy, but it's got nice wood, decent tables, extensive pool tables and ping pong, and sufficient TVs to keep everyone happy.  Beer selection isn't bad and the food is more than okay, although it's nothing to get excited about either.  Certainly decent enough to go hangout, tho. And our server, at least on a slow Saturday, was awesome. Drinks arrived almost as they were empty-- I swear she had telepathy or something..."}
{"text":"Felt very rushed on a Friday evening when there wasn't a lot of people. I got asked about a check 5 times before I was ready. Like let me enjoy my evening and buy drinks. Lost out on liquor sales due to the rush. Food was yummy."}
{"text":"I've eaten and played trivia here a few times and I've always had a good time. The jacked up wedges and the wings are awesome. Really enjoyed both of those, and the French dip sandwich was impressive as well. I've only had poor service once and it was obvious our waitress wasn't attentive. Besides that, pretty cool place."}
{"text":"We decided to stop here for a bite to eat last night because most places were closing relatively soon. Once we got there we were seating quickly as it was very slow there. The waitress was polite and did a decent job. She spent a lot of her night sitting at the table next to us discussing her up and coming weekend plans. We ordered our food which was chips and queso (not good at all, could've poured from a jar), wings (so dry that they reminded me of national lampoons Christmas when they were eating there burnt turkey), salad (not too bad), grilled cheese (was good), and tomato soup (worst tasting thing we'd ever received. We didn't even finish half of our food. We would probably not return if it weren't for the 2.50 mini draft beer special. We will go back for the beer but I wouldn't waste time on the food. We wanted to like it but just couldn't do it :("}
{"text":"Warmly greeted by Vanessa upon sitting at the bar. I asked a couple of questions regarding the beer selection and she made a recommendation. They have a good selection of beers both draft and bottles so it is nice to get a recommendation when you first arrive. ( Get the first one poured and then relax and actually READ the beer menu.)  Anyone can be nice when there aren't customer concerns... It is the true judge of a place with their reaction to a negative situation.  They get 5 stars for a great attitude and quick resolution.   Ordered a beer and the flavor was \"off\".  Let the bartender know.   With a big smile she apologized and quickly offered an option for resolution. She also let her manager know. The manager personally checked the situation and verified that something was off and replaced the beer with another apology for the inconvenience.  I'll definitely come back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were a bit high but this seems to be far from a \"pub.\"  Patrons and staff look more like the cast of Jersey Shore moved 500 miles west.  Lots of Guidos and Stellas. Noise level is VERY LOUD. Food was poor at best. I felt like leaving the meal and going across the street to Wendy's to eat.  I sat at the bar to order a dinner on a weekday evening.  Food tasted as though it was just out of the microwave.  Prices were not cheap either.  If this is typical Fox and Hound food and atmosphere, they will not get any of my business at any location."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with my boyfriend, we are from out of town and the bar manager was very friendly and helpful giving us info about local breweries to visit. I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup, it was really good! My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich and said it was delicious. They had a good beer selection including local craft beers on tap. Lots of TVs to watch the games on too."}
{"text":"Stopped by time check it out  and a very nice delicious  lunch. Wife's  bday and she had the Tuscan  flat bread. Very tasty and large portions. I had the fox and hound black forest. Good sandwich. Beer was ice cold and Britney  was delightful  friendly  and informative. They also  have a club  you can join for free. You get a free app on your bday. Price was middle of the road."}
{"text":"Really surprised by some of the less than stellar reviews.  I eat about once a week for lunch and have never had a bad experience.  Not sure if people are going at the wrong times or ordering the wrong things??  Here's what you need to know and do to have a good experience...  Any sandwich can be turned into a wrap and vice-versa.  With that being said, I love the taste and composition of the California Chicken Club - cheese, bacon, avocado, how can you go wrong?  I get that Cali Chicken Club as a wrap with regular fries or sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries are awesome!! I can't imagine a better lunch! I am also a fan of the wings as well.  Listen, its not 5-star food but it is definitely a step above your average bar food offering in the CLT area.    I've had a a few beers here after work and have never had a bad experience as far as slow service or flat beers as I've seen mentioned in other reviews.  I know this review is a bit of an outlier, but I've always had great experiences at this particular Fox and Hound.  Someone please try that Cali Chicken Club AS A WRAP and tell me how good it is!"}
{"text":"Up to this week the place had very good lunch specials, I came in on Monday not knowing the menu and prices have totally changed. I ordered the burger as I always do and instead of fries do a salad and get a tea or coke. In the past was like a 7-8 dollar lunch. Well come to find out after I order and eat ofcourse all that has changed, now its a 2.00 upcharge for swapping for salad and the drink is almost 3.00 so my 8.00 luch now goes to 13.00 without tip. Thats almost double the price without notice. Screw this place i wont be back"}
{"text":"The food is okay, but the service was pretty terrible. I joined our table late and shortly after our waitress checked on our table but never asked if I wanted something, I had to grab her attention as she was walking away to even place an order. Not impressed at all. Food came out in decent time and we ate. A little later the waitress wanted to leave which was okay (I've waitressed before so I totally understand), but she made it seem like we were inconveniencing her. In reality, we were waiting for our checks for over 30 minutes. After her saying she wanted to leave, we continued to wait 30 min for her to come back with our actual checks so she wasn't in a big hurry. Most of the time she was absent and unable to flag down."}
{"text":"Met up for happy hour with some coworkers to have a drink and some appetizers. We tried probably every appetizer on the menu. All of them were good except the balsamic glazed Brussel sprouts were amazing! The service was good and the bartenders were busy but were able to get drinks out within an acceptable time frame. The  atmosphere was more like a sports bar with pool tables and other games. It was good for what we wanted to do. We will most likely go back to watch games and hang out."}
{"text":"Our server was great, we received our first round of drinks quickly and she was sure to let us know all the specials before ordering. It was a while before we were ready to order our food because we were busy catching up and the server was great about coming by to check drinks during that time. Apparently after we ordered our food it took longer than normal because she said for some reason the order did no go through the computer and she took our meals off of our ticket without us even asking or complaining. And the food came out of the kitchen quickly in my opinion. Neat atmosphere, good food and beer and close by my place, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I think this place is relatively new, and it showed because it was super nice and clean. The service was decent and it was a great atmosphere to go hang out and watch a game or shoot some pool.  The food was....pretty basic bar food. Although the burgers were all very noticing visually, and the ingredients they had SHOULD have been great, both my burger and one of my friends were basically flavorless. They tasted like burger meat with no flavoring whatsoever. It wasn't a bad burger, but it was pretty bland aside from the fresh jalapeños on it. The nachos and other appetizers we ordered were pretty good, although the boneless wings were similar to stuff you find in the frozen foods, again not bad - but not great.  Anywho I would still come back here to try something else, grab a beer (selection was good) and watch a game."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends after work and because it's literally down the street from me.  We went around 730 on a Friday night and the back room was in use for a private event so we couldn't play darts (oh well).  Restaurant was maybe half full at best.  We picked a seat and had about 5 people come buy so trying to figure out who the actual waiter was was entertaining.  We got drinks and some of us ordered food.  The jacked up cheese wedges and their sauce was amazing and something I'd go back for.  Chili was decent.  Our waitress was probably one of the worst we've had in awhile.  She forgot a few drinks, I ordered the cheese wedges and she somehow got lemonade and Ice tea out of it.  Our bills were a mess.....not sure I'd go back to be honest"}
{"text":"Been a regular at F&H for many years and had many great experiences. Tbh I frequent the Birkdale location but today I stopped into the Northlake location and the service was outstanding! Megan was my bartender. She was polite, professional & held a wonderful conversation. Being familiar with the service industry I can tell when ppl work hard & when they don't. When I came in the bar was decently busy but Megan took my order and changed the tv for me (even though she was a fan of the team my team was playing against.) F&H has plenty of tv's and a good bar food menu. I'll come back and look forward to it!"}
{"text":"Ok here's the sernerio .. Friday night.. There out of sweet potato fries, salsa for the chips SWEET Tea... Can u believe that... In Charlotte no tea...the ladies at the checkin desk had one idea what's on the menu... Our server seemed to have her mind somewhere else hard to get ketchup here... Cold slaw needs major work.. Hard to give a tip here.."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a zero! It was super loud and had to ask for the music to be turned down (off because it's either off/on). Waited 10 mins to order a drink. Had to ask for refills! Waited 45 mins for food and only got it after asking for it. Had to get our own silverware & napkins. Poor service!!! Waiter had major attitude! Manager was accomadating but doesn't make up for poor service."}
{"text":"What a relaxing time eating the generous portion of the $13 chargrilled chicken skewers (serving size: 2) and their creamy $4.5 homemade tomato basil soup late at night! The chicken was tender and flavorful paired with red peppers, red onions and pilaf rice.  The waitress Sarah was friendly and efficient.  The bustling of the people at the bar and music was lively.  An ATM was available near the main entrance.  It was easy and free to park at this shopping center."}
{"text":"Spiked strawberry lemonade! Ladies you can never go wrong with a nice summer drink. Their cocktails are delicious."}
{"text":"Good place to watch the game. I had a friend from Virginia in town so we went to watch the Redskins game on Sunday afternoon. It gets crowded on gameday. About 40% of the place was Steelers fans and another 40% Packers fans, but we were able to get a TV switched to the Washington game (first come, first serve on TVs). I got the Ranch Hand (burger) and it was delicious. A few of the other customers were rude to us about the game. That put a damper on the overall experience, but I know it's not the restaurant's fault."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here at this establishment and It was a nice place and the atmosphere was quiet. I had a burger and fries.  It was around lunchtime, but there was not a crowd. I was surprised though that they had lemons sitting out on the bar the entire time I was there. The burger was good but it was soggy and sloppy it made me wish that I had ordered something different. The fries were good and they give you a good bit of them. The had the juke box on playing great upbeat songs."}
{"text":"Tons of draft beer to choose from, delicious food, awesome service, and fun entertainment, plus the games are always on. Great atmosphere, I really have a fun time. If you like beer battered chicken tenders, try theirs :)"}
{"text":"I am giving Fox and Hound 3 starts because it is truly hit or miss. The food is always ok ( just your standard bar food from a chain) but the service is what breaks the experience. I work at the mall nearby and like a lot of mall employees the girls from work enjoy going out after work. But it is clear that the service you receive is directly related to the number of drinks you order. If you order bottles of wine your server doesn't leave you alone however, if you are in to have a coke and a meal after a long shift don't expect to find your server for over 30 minutes. Disappointed because I would expect the same service no matter what my bill is this time."}
{"text":"I drive past this place everytime I am on my way to the 485 or coming back.  It seems crazy crowded on certain occasions. I was invited out for some pool and drinks, and I was already curious about the place so here is my review.  For those who love to shoot pool and have some drinks, this is a great bar.  They have 7 full size tables (maybe more), along with a punching bag game, ping pong, darts.  The pool cues were straight (made of fiberglass I think, but felt ok).  There were TVs everywhere, so I am sure its great for games also, and the night I went they had singers getting judged.  Some better than others.  The food was typical fare for any bar, and the beer selection was also typical.  Service was great, with our server walking by just enough to make sure we didn't need anything."}
{"text":"Stopped here between hockey games. Waitress was very slow and went MIA a few times. Food was ok,boys had steaks that were ok,tots were good with my sandwich. Did have a good draft selection,had what I wanted which is a Kentucky Bourbon barrel ale. Price was decent,lots of TV's. Only other real complaint was the music was to loud."}
{"text":"Came for Friday night out with wife and children. This is not the first time I have been to this location. The staff is always very available and friendly and keep you satisfied. The food is good, but I would go more for the sports and service! My order came out with incorrect taco shells, and even though I still ate it, the manager came out and took care of my meal and even gave me my correct order! Always great service! Lots of tv's and music can be loud at times, but overall not bad for a weeknight out, or if you want a place to catch the game with friends!"}
{"text":"Typical sports bar (or should I say Pub) and grill atmosphere and food.  I liked the beer batter chicken fingers I had on my first visit.  My second visit my husband and I dined there we had the spinach/artichoke appetizer and cheeseburger.  The appetizer was reheated dip and bagged chips and my husband said the burger was ok.   I wish the food was made fresh not frozen, but if you are there to watch \"the game\", it probably doesn't matter so much because beer makes everything taste better!  The wait staff provides good service, but they do dress to appeal to the men."}
{"text":"I asked the waitress what would she recommend from the menu, she say the Fish and Chips. WOW if you think that was good then, i could imagine the rest of the menu!! SCARY!!!! The fish was soggy and disgusting. The coleslaw looked like it was sitting in that same cup for a month. I figured how wrong can you go with water, and God knows the water is gross here but geez have it filtered for your customers, it tasted like heavy chemicals was in it."}
{"text":"I've only been here one time since I'm not a huge fan of \"sports bars\". I came here around 10pm on a Friday night to get a quick drink and app. My friend and I had the some sort of girly concoction with strawberries and vodka. Not your normal drink at a sports bar, but it was good! We also shared the hot pretzels with cheese for an app. It was recommended by the waitress and it didn't take much to convince us that it would be worth it. It hit the spot and was exaclty what I needed after a stressful plane ride during the holiday rush. The crowd was the typical groups of men out drinking beer and watching sports. Nothing too exciting."}
{"text":"I give it an \"eh\". For having subpar reviews on Yelp, I definitely saw the flaws as well.  My wife and I were the second ones in the restaurant when they opened, greeted by 3 hostess/servers. We ordered the beer battered mozz sticks for an app and I ordered the beer battered chicken fingers. Sad to say it took 24 minutes before our entrees came out. Not acceptable with only two sets of customers in the whole restaurant.   The food was worth the wait though. The chicken \"crispers\" were great. Thick white chicken meat in a heavily fried crispy outside. Think of Chilis chicken crispers. They were huge! You could get them smothered in sauces such as ranch, mustard, or BBQ but I chose to have the sauce on the side.  The BBQ is very good as well.  A nice blend of sweet with a quick of spice at the end. Also served with fries covered in parmesan cheese crumbles. I didn't understand the beer batter, might just be a marketing ploy, but definitely just tasted like a normal battered chicken. Obviously the beer gets cooked out, but no added flavor or any flavor to make it remotely represent beer.   Our waitress was great, offered us to sign up for their reward program which offers free appetizers. Disappointingly, they were out of cards to give us, so she handed us a piece of paper to fill out and do all the leg work at home by signing up.  Needless to say we didn't. Definitely a lack in management. How can you be out of the cards when the restaurant just opened and we were the second customers in the door?   Overall, a good stop if every other restaurant in Birkdale is busy.  Caution going here if you are on a time crunch. The experience is similar to a Chilis or Ruby Tuesday."}
{"text":"Crap service. Foods not all that great. But they do have ping pong. And decent beer specials here and there."}
{"text":"Love this location of Fox and Hound/ food is great and so is the service. Pool tables , dart boards. Basketball game, boxing game and golf and more"}
{"text":"We've been here several times. And this time wasn't great at all. Our waitress acted like the table beside us was more important than her other tables because she found out they were from the same hometown.   There were 4 of us and all of our Food was cold and not good at all. I ordered water 4 times before our waitress brought it to me. We've used to go to the restaurant to watch games, but we will be choosing another spot from now on."}
{"text":"Finally, we got some food when we went to watch the game after the Carolina Beer Company brewery tour.  This place was picked solely for the game-watching aspect, but they said that the food would be decent as well.  Seeing as how we got there at 2:30pm, there was hardly anyone in the place.  In fact, I think there were more people in the restaurant than at the Georgia Tech coliseum for the GT v. NC State basketball game that we were watching.  We sat at the long table just behind the bar so that we didn't make any of the staff work too hard to push tables together.  We were prompted waited on for our beverages, but seeing as it was a large group, with all the different cars trickling in, it took a while before the server was ready to take our order.  This is bar food.  It's on the nice end of bar food, with lots of entrees of substance to choose from, but don't be fooled, it's Sysco food that's been heated.  I got the Napa salad - grilled chicken and spinach - and against my better judgment didn't ask for the dressing on the side.  Sure enough, it was coated, the way that many Americans prefer it, as my friends told me.  Jimmy got the brisket sandwich with fries.  The fries were decent, the sandwich looked a little rough, but Jimmy didn't complain (though he rarely does).  Some at the end of the table got the chips and salsa.  The salsa was good, but the chips were starting to get stale.    Jon had the worst time, since he got the chicken fingers, and being Sysco chicken fingers, they were about half chicken and half breading.  Jon doesn't like breading, so he proceeded to pick off most of the breading, mutilating his lunch.    I'd go back for a sports event - there were tons of huge TVs on every wall, but here's hoping that if we're driving all the way to Charlotte, we're going to the actual sporting event, not just going to watch it on TV at F&H."}
{"text":"This place is the typical, average bar/resraurant. They have several televisions and the staff are very nice. Food selection is average. If you don't like/eat meat, you're pretty SOL. They carry a few local brews."}
{"text":"I met 2 girlfriends at Fox & Hound before a movie down the street.  This was my first visit to any of the Fox & Hound chain.  There was street parking next to the restaurant, if you could find a spot, or two parking garages within a short walk.  We all arrived around 11:45 to a basically empty restaurant - a little early for the Saturday lunch crowd, I guess.  We were asked where we wanted to sit, which was nice, and were promptly seated in a comfy booth.    We ordered the nachos ($9?) as an appetizer and they were standard bar nachos of chips, cheese, black beans, sour cream, olives, but a very large portion.  For lunch, I ordered the French Dip Flatbread ($10+), which was flatbread topped with alfredo sauce, topped with caramelized onions and london broil, and then topped with fried onions.  Served with au jus.  It was a HUGE portion and very tasty.  All of our drinks were refilled several times (I drink a lot and an empty glass is a tip-killer) and we were given enough napkins as to not necessitate wiping our hands on our pants.  Our server was friendly and attentive.    The restaurant is furnished as the standard sports bar - nice size bar with tv's, dark wood everywhere - typical AppleChiliFriday's type of place.  The only complaint I would have was the music was WAY too loud for a Saturday morning.  When we first got there, the restaurant was basically empty and the music was deafening.  Other than that, it was a fine experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I were spending a casual night out without the kids. I had purchased a Groupon $10 for $20 worth of food.  We visited on a Sunday evening, and were seated right away.  I ordered a Golden Margarita, which was pretty good.  For my entree I ordered the Black & Bleu burger w/onion rings.  I was pleasantly surprised when my burger arrived.  The burger was hand pattied and cooked perfectly.  The patty was seasoned with cracked black pepper and topped with Applewood bacon and crumbled blue cheese on a fresh ciabatta bun....yum!  The onion rings were thick cut, breaded nicely, which made for a nice crunch, and surprisingly, not at all greasy.    I probably would not have chosen this place without the Groupon, but I truly enjoyed the meal, especially while watching the Olympic games."}
{"text":"Tuesday nights are the night here... $2 pints...the food is just typical bar grub. Worth checkin out."}
{"text":"The only saving grace of this place is hat they have beer and it's cold and that the servers are friendly. I have no clue how they managed to mess up such simple food so royally. First of all it took us 20-30 minutes to get NACHOS and when they arrived they were cold. The manager apologized and remade our order. At this point we were happy with the resolution and decided to stay. Then we made the mistake of ordering the chocolate chip cookie. After waiting for 15+ minutes for it to come out, we were informed that the kitchen had burned the first one. Okay, I guess that happens. But then when the second one came out it was RAW. Avoid this place unless you're just coming for a drink."}
{"text":"The fact I have to write this is sad.... It's 1:30pm on October 30th. Sitting at the bar trying to convince a stubborn managers named Sheila (GM) and Jason... to change the huge tv tuned to Seattle/NO game to the Carolina Panthers. Jason claimed that they have huge Seattle following.  He said its on the other side of the bar and we could move....  However, that Seattle group moved to a different bar this year. The only fans here are panther fans!  They will NOT change the channel. I wonder how other cities would handle this situation... would they allow other games on their huge jumbo tron tv with anything but the home team?!?  There have been about 15 people begging them to change it... they won't. They will not even come out of the office. This is unacceptable and I can't believe they are so stubborn.  Don't come here if you're a panthers fan!!!  They don't care.  I will follow the Seattle group and also move to a different bar!"}
{"text":"Do not stop in here. I have absolutely no idea how this location is still open. Went in on Saturday night after work. About 730 pm. My boyfriend and I each ordered a beer, waitress brought that and came back to take our order, and had to come back three times because everything we ordered they were out of. No soup, no tacos, no flatbread, no French dip. All on a Saturday night. Service was mediocre at best. No manager came out to apologize for the inconvenience of having no food to serve with the exception of fried food. Our bill was outrageous and my boyfriend was joking with the waitress and said this is too much and she came back very snappy and rude and was like too bad. We will never go back and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The pool tables were clean, level, and fast.  My big bro and I ordered the Sampler platter it was REALLY good, filling, and hot-honey wings rocked!  GReat flavors, can;t say anything was truly original, but at least the standard bar fare, was above standard for taste!!"}
{"text":"They have a nice menu selection, I just feel that their wings can come out with a little more sauce on them. Great place to catch a game or shoot some pool. Make sure to always ask what is the drink special for the day."}
{"text":"Clean inside, even if the patrons aren't. The noise gets pretty high so be ready to yell. Large selection of drinks, and looks like a full menu but we didn't order off of it. Alot of weird smells float around this place.  It is a good place to settle on if no one has a better idea, but I wouldn't make plans in advance."}
{"text":"The reason it's called fox and hound is because the service is hit or miss.  Been here three times and it's been more miss. The only I reason gave it two stars is because they have a couple cute waitresses.  Food is ok, beer selection very good.  The waitress never gave me napkins, I had to use a wet beer bottle napkin.  Going to the cork and something next.  I am going avoid this place."}
{"text":"This really isn't a bad place for for the price.  Their menu has a nice variety of items at reasonable prices.  My personal favorites are the pretzel bites (appetizer) the bavarian sandwich, and the black and bleu burger.  Nothing extravagant, but all of them have great flavor, and a good sized portion to them.   The wait staff is hit or miss lately... It's ranged from phenomenal service to very sub-par performance.  But the food is always top notch, and there is normally a manager floating around to ask if everything is going good with the meal."}
{"text":"An enjoyable evening out. Manager and staff were friendly and helpful, food was tasty, lots of sports to watch on the 20+ TVs, and plenty of pool tables for fun!"}
{"text":"I came here to grab a drink with some friends while we were in the area. It was a pretty big bar area which was nice because we were a large group. There are several tv's if you are there to watch a sporting event.  We tried their spinach and artichoke dip which was good, but their cheese wedges were delicious with the sweet chili dip. I highly recommend those. My husband also ordered their fish and chips and he was pleased with it as well.  They had a nice outdoor seating area with heaters which made it comfortable even though it was later in the evening and a bit chilly otherwise."}
{"text":"I stopped in here one evening to have a quick beer and ended up getting a couple of appetizers.  It is mostly a bar atmosphere with lots of TVs everywhere, there were tons of people watching games etc in there.  We had the pretzels and beer cheese which was actually pretty good. You could taste the beer but it wasn't overwhelming. We also had the jacked up cheese wedges, I had them before at another Fox & Hound and they were much better there. These had too much breading and not enough cheese. It may have been a one time thing.  Most of their beer selection is standard beers, not a whole lot of local options but a few."}
{"text":"Had reservations at the Red Rocks Cafe across the street. I was meeting friends for dinner and is was closed due to a fire. I even had confirmed reservations from Open Table. Not wanting to buck Christmas traffic we walked across the street to the Fox & Hound. If I knew what I was getting into I would have driven to Atlanta.  The waitress was very pleasant. We were there early at 5 so she had only one table, us. She didn't rush us as we looked over the typical sports bar menu. The two women ordered half rack of ribs. I ordered fried chicken/fries/coleslaw/ honey mustard dipping sauce. The other gentleman ordered French dip. Ten minutes later the server returned informing us they were out of ribs. Five o'clock on a Friday evening and out of ribs. I don't get it. Being early the place was maybe 5% occupied. It took us about 40 minutes to get our food.  My wife ordered a dinner salad no peppers. There were peppers when she received it. My fried chicken wasn't terrible but a bit greasy. The fries were absolutely terrible. Shoe string cut way way over cooked so they were more like potato sticks. The coleslaw had no taste. I think it's a great place to get drunk and watch a game. The food may even be eatable after a six pack."}
{"text":"Prototypical sports bar, lots of tvs. If there is ever a tv shortage in stores, I'm gonna make a raid on this place!  Birkdale location keeps it front & center and busy. Front dining room gives way to a large bar area, with round tops congregated in front of a long bar, with huge row of tvs above.  A third, back room contains more tables and tvs, and some video games in back left corner.  Definitely a busy place on weekends and for big games during the week. Can also get kinda smoky.  When its nice out, the front patio area is a great place to get away from the smoke inside, watch some tv on the outdoor screens, and people watch, as there are always crowds wandering around Birkdale.  Food is typical bar food, nothing too fancy, but they do serve late, which is nice.  All in all, great place to go for a sporting event, to drink, or late-night if you've already been drinking."}
{"text":"We own Above Board Flooring and take our clients here all the time. A great place to take clients too. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Our server, Cyanne, would probably screw up the greeter job at Walmart. We had to ask for a straw 3 times, she screwed up a super easy order, and when she brought the bill she failed to bring a pen. She never asked if we wanted more drinks either and I am pretty sure servers tips are still based on quality of service and a percentage of the final bill. The food was just \"ok\", a little light on flavor.   We used to love Fox and Hound in Ohio and Texas. We won't be back to any of the ones in NC."}
{"text":"This place has some greasy nights.  I mean greasy in the way Bubbles from Trailer Park Boys uses it.  They do dirty stuff here.  There is a picture of Jello wrestling.  They have wet t-shirt contest type events.  The meat market for women stuff.  It is a free country and most of the time these events aren't going on.  The mediocre food, sub-par service, and limited beer selection don't redeem this place that is calm by day and sometimes burlesque by night.  I don't like the feeling of seeing all these flyers for all these flesh fest events they have.  I don't like the Hooters experience and this place gives off more of that side of sex vibe.  Hide your wife, hide your kids, this isn't a family place."}
{"text":"I'd say more like 3 1/2 stars would be accurate.  I wanted to watch my NY Football Giants on Monday at a bar, so I convinced my brother-in-law to meet me here as I thought it was 1/2 way between our respective homes.  It was not, 25 min trip for me, 15 for him.  No big deal, my sisters ended up joining us too for a little while, and us girls split 20 wings since they were $.45 each on Monday nights.  You can order them in any denominaton, the server said you could get 2 if you wanted, that's weird I would never order 2 wings.  They were decent, but they were fried and I haven't had wings that were deep fried in a while and I prefer them to be grilled or smoked now.  Our server was pretty good for the majority of the night, but for the end of the 3rd quarter and most of the 4th she was no where to be seen.  And all I wanted as I nervously watched the game start to change, was one more delicious Guiness!!  She finally came around and I got my drink, but still, nobody likes to be kept waiting so long for beer.  A while after my sisters had left and my BIL devoured his own order of wings, we got some more food.  He went with nachos, I went with the Black Forest sandwich, with no bacon or ham.  But I think they left off the cheese too, no big deal.  The pretzel roll was soooo good, it was soft and warm.  I could have ate it on its own, but the turkey, lettuce, tomato and honey mustard were all great on it.  I opted for no side as I wasn't really that hungry, so the sandwich alone hit the spot.  Overall, besides the Cowboys fans that I was ready to jump after the beginning of the game, it was a solid option for a sports bar.  Plenty of TVs, good bar food, reasonable prices and plenty of drink specials daily.  I've been to the University and Uptown locations as well, and they seem to be pretty standard all around."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. They have great daily food specials and pretty decent drink specials. It being a Thursday, I got the 4 dollar cheese burger. It was well worth it. It comes with your choice of cheese and all the fixings. The only downside I saw, which is pretty consistent with the other reviews, is the service being really slow."}
{"text":"The best food ever! I love it here! My server is great. I think everyone should come and try the pretzel bites and local craft beer selections!!"}
{"text":"Down in South Charlotte, This place is where u would want to go for a night of pool and beer. this place host regular events, like Pool tournaments, Poker nights, UFC PPVs, and even karaoke contest. the crowd that comes here are generally respectful. not the kind of drunk bar guys u will meet in Moe's bar in The Simpsons.  Pool is very reasonably cheap they have bout 7 full size table and i think 3 - 4 smaller ones, but the also got Darts,  Foosball, Corn holes and even a Punching Bag Machine (which im not a big fan personally)  they have differen't pool rate per hour according the day of the week that ur playing, ranging from $5-10 an hour,   They do have drink specials or even a meal special which is good, people always wants a deal lol.   i have to say the place has undergo some big changes in the last 5- 6 years, things on the menu,  staff, the atmosphere, i have to say now its much better than before, except the food cause they dont have my God Father Melt no more ='(   PS their chicken fingers were really tender and juicy tho.... O_O"}
{"text":"Ordered the fish & chips and the batter so over fried and super crispy that I think I chipped my teeth.   Needless to say I took only 1 bite and that was enough for me. I did eat all the fries though"}
{"text":"i go here every now and then for wrestling events and rarely if im in the area.  on more than three occasions i have walked in, sat down, and waited easily over 15-20 minutes to be served.  waitresses will walk by and either not say anything to you, or, will smile and say hi in a manner that is standoffish.  once you get someone to wait on you, then the service isnt that bad.  i do realize on certain nights it gets busy but they should have the common sense to know who needs service.  a few reviews have mentioned tabs being wrong, overcharged, etc.  this has happened to me a few times and yes, it is aggravating to get them to correct the mistake.  a tell-tale sign that there is a problem: last month i went thru all of the above, got my check, tipped between 15-20%, and when the server came back she grabbed my arm and said, thank you so much for that tip.  that tells me that bad service and bad tipping are prevalent here.  overall:  good food, but dont expect much."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good! Id give it at least 3-4 stars however heading here on a Saturday night messed up our entire night. Destiny our server was nice but this place was actually one of the worse places I have been in Charlotte on a Saturday. The place was filthy we sat down at a dirty table (once I told the server she cleaned it off for us) and it took almost 2 hours to actually receive our food when the place was not slammed at all. Our server seemed like she got it to us as fast as she could since it was still warm. The bar looked less than 1/4 full and it took about 50 minutes to receive our adult cheer order. The most disturbing things that need to be noted 1) ridiculously under staffed 2) awfully dirty 3) poor customer service 4) wait time for food 5) atmosphere created 6) no mgmt was present so it seemed like it didnt matter that everything was a mess 7) dirty bathrooms 8) hostess stand had dirty dishes stashed there 9) no sign to seat yourself or wait to be seated 10) poor dress code   We watched four employees walk by 4 tables that were dirty the entire time we were there...people came in and would not be seated for 20 minutes but it was because all the tables were so dirty but empty. Suggestions...get a attentive manager. One who cares. Staff properly. Train your staff. Floors were not picked up and this was just unheard of in Charlotte! Not cool at all. Never going back here...the people working seemed miserable and unhappy to be there...overworked for sure and negative.our server seemed to push through all that but the rest of the folks seemed annoyed to be working."}
{"text":"Being a budget-friendly, better-than-domestic beer seeker and connoisseur, Fox & Hound is one of my oldest friends for a decent pint night with $2 drafts on Tuesday and Thursday. (i like when servers say small pints are on special...i thought a pint big or small meant 16 ounces) They have a pretty decent draft selection including New Castle, Old Meck Copper, Shock Top, Fat Tire, Sweetwater 420, and others.  Our first round was slow to arrive. Our server checked on us a lot, but always gave the feeling that she was getting sent home soon, surprisingly she stayed with us the whole time we were there.    The Black Forest sandwich was pretty tasty. Turkey on a pretzel-like bun. The Queso is always a favorite for us here.    They had Tuesday night karaoke, but didn't really have the crowd for it.  i should mention they do have a beer club card and although i don't actually remember what i can get with said card, the combination of their beer special and rewards for drinking beer will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst bar I've been to . After about 5 drinks I realized they purposely made their drinks extremely weak. I spent so much money and barely got tipsy. I told the bartender I was disappointed with my drinks and she literally screamed at me as I walked out of the door ( I still left her a good tip!) I will never ever go there again. Trashy, nasty and extremely rude staff. There was even a fight with some dude broke glass and almost hit us with it and there was no real bouncers- just a few people who worked there who barely stopped him from attacking us. Completely ruined my night-especially the rude bartenders."}
{"text":"Good fresh food, amazing drinks and u can't go wrong with free pool if you spend $15 or more. Service was attentive will come back in the future."}
{"text":"Went here with some colleagues for a drink after work. Seemed like a great place for 20 somethings looking to get drunk and have a night at the bar; however was a bit noisy and too much like college for us."}
{"text":"Fox & Hound in Pineville has to be my absolute favorite location! The staff is always attentive and happy to help. Teki is fantastic and always goes out of her way to make sure my husband and I have an excellent time! The food is not your typical bar food but acceptable for any foodie palate because the food is made up to par. I just can't explain how much I love this place! Great food, staff, and bar games! Highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"7/17 of the tables were empty which seemed to be a moderately slow night... I'm not sure what took so long for a Long Island and beer but the drinks alone from the bar took about 12 mins and the food was even longer... it's been well over 35 mins and we have still not been served... I am seriously over this spot.. I really want to just tell the waitress , \" no thank you\" and leave but I'm trying to remain kosher."}
{"text":"Food for Pub Food was above avg ok for a return but I asked for patio seat to later have a smoker set beside me. Told non smokers under canopy. BAD POLICY. No Smoking means NO SMOKING"}
{"text":"Came to play pool and drink a beer. I saw lights out, carpet missing, bartenders eating behind the bar (which may have been allowed but I don't care to ever watch my server have food swishing around their mouth) and bus boys chewing on the floor as well. Thought about food because we were hungry but the food they serve is either fried or processed."}
{"text":"We should have known this place wasn't going to be good, it was dead for a Saturday night.  My wings we ok, but soggy not crispy at all.  My husbands fish tacos were bad and his broccoli was cold.  My daughters chicken sandwich was stiff and gross.  Service was lacking.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is one of the few in Charlotte NC, that does NOT have an all flats up charge for all flat wings. I absolutely detest the fact that if I'm going to spend my money in your establishment, I should absolutely be able to order what I want. I asked to speak with a manager. Fuck it, I can't, this place fuckin sucks! Management is a got damn joke, for real. Do NOT Come here."}
{"text":"Best place around to relax in after shopping at the nearby stores or just for taking a break . The bartender is awesome. I think his name was Shayne. Conversation is engaging and others at the bar loved him. He was attentive to all. I had a cheeseburger, parmesan fries and an Angry Orchard beer."}
{"text":"Good drink specials depending on the day. Good service is hit or miss. Televisions are definitely a plus. The food menu was definitely better before, but they changed it about 6m-1yr ago and removed about half of the entrees. It's a nice bar to grab a few drinks and keep it moving."}
{"text":"Decent spot if you want to play pool or watch live music but other than that it's nothing special. The food isn't bad but the service is very inconsistent. This is not a go to bar for me but they occasionally have live music which is always a plus. If the service improved this would be a much better sports bar."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Always fast service, and the food and drinks are always on point!! The bartenders are always on their A game and management really seems to care about customers and the restaurant. As a bonus, the place is super clean!"}
{"text":"Yes I am a fan of this particular restaurant. First they have plenty of TVs for game day and they will put on a game we request. The restaurant is usually half empty when we go in which is usually a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. Now that is in way a bad thing. We get better service, faster food, and like I said better game day viewing. They also have huge booths which are great for large parties or a typical family with kids.  I have to say I can't review the menu because the only thing I ever get is the Black Forest sandwich and fries. I love, love, love that sandwich. I never get anything else. You just can't go wrong with a pretzel bread sandwich."}
{"text":"Onion rings were really good! Drinks weren't prepared the best I had to send it back. Service was great! Clean bar. Several menu items. However do not attend their events! I went for fight night and they advertised free it was 10$ they packed the place out where there was standing room only and a fight broke out in the bar!"}
{"text":"Been here a million times over the years. The bar food is solid. The games are good and you never have to wait. The staff if swift and the beer is always cold. I have put my name is the fish bowl and won a party for 10 it was a huge hit! I recommend trying this place out. The parking is not bad either and it's in a great location and east access off the freeway for people living on the east side or west side."}
{"text":"Awesome service and friendly, upbeat staff"}
{"text":"Manager and staff need to realize that all forms of government ID are proof of age. In my mid 40's and accidentally hand them an ID other than my drivers license and they refused to serve me a beer even though the ID provided carries considerably more weight than an ordinary state issued drivers license.   When I realized what has occurred I provided my drivers license and the they were ok.    Still, education is paramount!"}
{"text":"Pros: Very sports bar like atmosphere.  It is well kept, and lots of programs on TV.  I had the wings and a mushroom burger.  It was a really good experience.  Our waitress was really friendly, food is great, and serving time for 4 people is fast. Cons: not much that I can write here.  Conclusion: I really like eating here.  Also she carded us for drinks. We had different state IDs, but gave us the drinks anyways.  Later on she saw our credit cards, and saw that we were all from different states, She told us she thought we had fakes and gave us the drinks anyways."}
{"text":"Had been here before place changed names and had enjoyed it. Lunch time today and very few people there. Staff and especially management seemed put out that they had to be bothered to be of service. Terrible experience. Won't return."}
{"text":"good burgers, sorta \"hot\" wings, cold beer, lotsa tv's and sports."}
{"text":"Above reviewers made the point,  this's average sports bar, food is too salty, and greasy, I had the grilled spinach salad, it was too salty, the grilled chicken was no where to be seen, they chopped it and probably quarter of a chicken breast, ...."}
{"text":"We are not ever, ever, ever, EVER going back to this place. This was our first visit and that was enough for a lifetime. We should have picked up and left as soon as we saw the lack of cleanliness of the bathrooms. If the bathrooms are dirty in a restaurant - the kitchen isn't much different. Take it from me, I know this. I sell into this industry and visit restaurants all day long. Good clean restrooms=good clean kitchen.  So the place is as dark as dark can get in the middle of the day. All the blinds are closed so TV viewing is best, I guess. Our waitress Emily L takes our order with little enthusiasm but that's ok. 20 minutes later I'm asking where our sandwich and bowl of chili are. She says,\" It will be out in a little while.\" WRONG ANSWER The correct answer is \"I'm sorry, I will check for you.\" I expect hot food to appear in 15 minutes or less - in any restaurant. That's the correct wait time. That's all! Emily L got a $2 tip...and that was generous. Never again.  Or yeah, the food wasn't very good either. There are better places."}
{"text":"Visited Sunday morning before the football games started up.  Had six children in tow, so they were able to accomodate us by putting together a couple tables in the back dining room.  Our waitress was pleasant and attentive.  The place has three large dining areas, two of which have pool tables and other pub games.  They also have a large bar, and TVs all over the joint.  Good beer and liquor selection.  At this point, I'd give the place four stars...and if you were coming for beer and sports, you'd be very happy.  The food...overpriced for what you get.  The all-you-can eat chips and salsa for $4.95 is a solid deal, but the boneless wings were sparse in quantity.  The beer cheese soup was bland, and for $4.95 for a bowl, I was again disappointed by the quantity.  The kids seemed happy with their selections (kid's menu available).  Lastly, my burger (guacamole burger) was cooked to order and probably the best thing I ate.  My guess is the burgers are the best food option here."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't get the bad reviews.  Ive lived in the Birkdale area since May and come here all the time.  The food is fantastic, the drinks are cheap and the outside seating area is great!  1 ding in stars because the carpet smells inside, but that could be an easy fix for them if they chose to reinvest in the place - my wife can't stand the carpet smell  Everyone ive brought here, which is a lot of people, has had a great experience as well and have enjoyed the food.    ** get the drunken chicken tenders rolled in their garlic parm sauce - life changing!"}
{"text":"Great service...Staff is really friendly and love to get to know the regulars....pretty much the only reason I go back.  That and the great draft beer selection."}
{"text":"Let me start this off by saying I'm a very forgiving customer. I've served in restaurants from the cheap, under $10 meals to high end fine dining in DC so I get that service is not always 100% at times. But let me say that the service I had today was awful. We saw our server Chante a grand total of three times... Once for drinks, once to order (\"what do you want,\" she asked us without even a hello) and once when she ran our cards AFTER someone else brought us the check when we asked them.   We finished eating at 5:08.... we got our check at 5:28. In those 20 minutes, we watched her dance in the kitchen, stand at the bar, check her phone at the hostess stand numerous times, stand with with her coworkers on the floor and walk by us more than 5 times with no acknowledgment.   With only 5 tables in the place (and 5 servers) I can't imagine she was overwhelmed.   On the food side- very mediocre. Nothing I'd go out of my way for again."}
{"text":"Just left there.  We have been the quite a few times.  The service has been consistently getting worse.  They apologized saying they were busy and it was the slowest I have ever seen it.  Could not even find a manager to say anything."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner. Got the fish tacos and unfortunately, although we got 3, I could only eat one. The sauce they put on the fish was very strange, and not a good compliment. Way too many onions on them as well. Had to take them off. From looking at the reviews here, I don't think food is their specialty, but they sure have a lot of screens for sports fans."}
{"text":"This place is it's own worst enemy.  It's a good sized sports bar with plenty of pool tables and a couple dart boards in the back.  They've got a wide selection of beers and a pretty nice menu.  However, this was the rudest most uninformed staff I've seen in quite some time.  Apparently they are very compartmentalized in their duties and WILL NOT SERVE YOU outside of their job description.  For example, I wanted to order a drink and a meal.  The bar tender ( after looking in my face and ignoring me for 7 minutes) would take my drink order, but not my food order because we were 12 people at a table.  In the 3 hours we were there I saw my waitress twice, both times upon specific request.  Also, I asked if they had Lambec and the waitress told me NO.  Ten minutes later I went to the bar and could see it sitting in the fridge behind the bartender.    I will not be going back here EVER!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this location.  The Beer Club event once a month, from 5pm-7pm, is a good look.  Its worth joining.  Going today after work."}
{"text":"Had a private party here so didn't really experience the food- just the beer. I can say without a doubt that the highlight of the evening was two of the most attentive and impressive servers I have experienced in a long time. Amber and Miranda were absolutely fantastic. They played the crowd perfectly learning everyone's names like they were old friends, mixing it up just enough and always keeping an eye out for nearly empty pint glasses. These two wonderful people made the experience significantly more enjoyable and I am grateful that they were our servers."}
{"text":"The food is awesome the rosemary chicken is the bomb. Their drinks are delightful and so is their staff i have a great time going here and it is now my home bar. Missey is my fave server/ bartender she takes awesome care of you! Come to fox abd hound they have excellent  deals and it feels like home."}
{"text":"It has been a few years since I've stepped foot in a Fox And Hound Bar...some things have changed while others remain the same...the service was great and the food was good, they were not the reason for my three stars...my complaint is the lack of low level seating. I am a handicapped individual so the high seats are a little bothersome for me...we went on a not so busy night and there were no low seats available..only high chairs and high booth seats, so I was a bit uncomfortable...also the seats are rather torn apart..floor was rather sticky and/or slippery depending on where you stepped...same with our table, just wasn't cleaned with much care..  As I said service was great, the food was good not great...I ordered fish and chips, something I've ordered a lot at other fox and hounds....I was able to sub out my Cole slaw for a second order of tater tots..instead of fries...fish was great and the tater sauce is good, may not be house made...tater tots were cooked poorly on some and good on others...crunchy or soggy, depending on which pile you took from...it was a TON of food..more than I could finish, but they had these mason jar desserts that I could not pass on...they were limited time so I am not sure how long they will be around for...  We will be back, I can't not come back because of seating...but I hope in the future this is something that can be addressed"}
{"text":"I would hate for you to order food late at your local Fox and Hounds in Huntersville."}
{"text":"Ok for a place to drink a few but nothing special.  Went with a friend.  We had beers, chips and salsa, and wings.  Again nothing special.  Sat in the patio area outside, sorta narrow."}
{"text":"As a recently legal 21 year old living in Huntersville for the summer, there aren't too many options when it comes to grabbing a beer in the area. Fox and the Hound has served as the local watering hole for my friends and I this summer, mostly by process of elimination. Drink specials, especially for beer, are pretty decent. $2 domestic drafts and $2.50 import drafts on Thursday. Thursday is also karaoke night...you were warned.   I guess the biggest beef that I have with this place is the atmosphere. Everytime I come, I feel like I'm drinking in an Applebees. Yes, I realize this is a chain, but after coming from the splendid pub scene in London and even the college bar scene at Indiana University, I naturally expect my drinking establishments to have at least a slight bit of character.   Service is decent, depending on the waitress you get. As far as food goes, I've only had some of the appetizers, which were just so-so. Nachos were the best, wings mediocre, and pizza pretty god-awful. With all of the other dining options in Birkdale, it seems a little silly to choose to come here solely for the food.  In the summer they charter a boat every Saturday to take you out on Lake Norman. For those who don't have a boat, it's a nice way to see the lake and go for a swim on a hot day. You can get free \"VIP\" tickets from the waitresses, otherwise it costs $10. Did it once, and it was fun, but not something that I'm aching to do again.   Overall, not a terrible place to grab a drink, but don't expect too much out of it."}
{"text":"Ordered french dip and the meat was tough and dry. The Aju seemed like it may have been previously frozen, like the stale bread.  Bozena got a burger and it was dry even though it was ordered medium. The fries were kind of crispy (a good thing to me), but flavorless.    Perhaps this experience was an anomaly or maybe what we ordered is not what this location concentrates on.  When paying for food at a restaurant, I don't always expect it to be better than what I can make, but I do expect it to be satisfying or better than average.  I normally like to leave funny reviews; the the only thing funny about this evening was how I ran into the grocery store after dinner to get some dessert."}
{"text":"Only ok with the one star because the people working there were nice. Other than that....I still have a weird taste in my mouth from the food and the bathrooms were super gross. For sure not interested in going back except maybe to the location in Ballantyne. It is MUCH better."}
{"text":"Take the kids in the day for free pool. The waitstaff is always friendly and attentive.  The food is pricey for bar food, so we usually just get an appetizer."}
{"text":"Unfortunately they must be very short staffed. Over 1 hour after being seated and still no food. Not recommended.   On a good note, the management apologized and gave us our food for free."}
{"text":"My husband has frequented this location for at least 7 years and a currently has an All Star card. With an All Star card you get 50% off wings. Ordered 20 wings on 12/31/16 and card was swiped incorrectly for $21.10. A few days later I checked my account and noticed that 2 charges had posted to my account. One charge of $12.45 and $28.40. I've called Fox and Hound and spoke to several managers which include Jeff, William, and Scott, and Taylor. They blame it on their computer systems and they haven't tried anything to refund my money. The first day they claimed it wouldn't post to my account, 2nd day oh it will be refunded by 4am, 3rd day it takes 24 hours and now they tell me it will be 4-7 days. Totally unprofessional and unethical."}
{"text":"As a Michigan Alumni (go blue!), I come to Fox & Hound almost every weekend to watch the football game. And since I work near the area, my coworkers and I go there often for happy hour.  That being said, the food at Fox is pricey for what its worth. I've had undercooked Fish & Chips there before and I've had many of their dishes there before and nothing has ever really stuck out to me yet. The food is your most typical bar food except it's hard to find a decent dish, except maybe their hot and honey chicken wings.  The only props I must give Fox is their Tuesday dollar beer night and their party specials (If you get a group of 10 or more, they give certain amount of free wings and unlimited chips and salad).   Des[pite their food, Fox is a great place for a get together and for a sports night."}
{"text":"I've been to this Fox & Hound plenty of times. It's an average sports bar. Average bar food. Average prices. Average beer selection. It's nice if you want to get together with friends and watch some sports (their back room has a huge TV, with smaller flat screens scattered throughout the rest of the place) or just hang out when there's nothing else going on. You can also play pool, table tennis, or darts.  Every time we show up with a bigger party (10+) they usually accomodate with no problems, and the service is rarely off, which is impressive considering how confusing our bills can get.  They have decent daily specials, especially on Tuesdays where it's $2 for any drafts they have.  There really isn't anything that makes this bar stand out, but then again, there isn't really anything that has turned me away. I guess it's kind of our ol' reliable."}
{"text":"Walking around birkdale wanting to try a new restaurant we passed fox and hound. It was a nice day outside and saw they had plenty of outdoor seating.  We were greeted by 5 employees all standing around the front. Ok great, plenty of people to help.  We were seated outside ordered food, it took forever to get our food. With all of the people working and no customers you would think it would be a little faster.  The food was good. My husband got the drunken chicken tenders with bbq sauce.  I had the buffalo chicken sandwich.   The portions are large so you get your money's worth!  Can't say if we will be back due to the wait. I guess next time we don't need To be anywhere else this place would be fine."}
{"text":"Great food except I had to continuously remind our server to bring everything out. Even had to pull the menu back out and explain to her what came with our meal. After working in the service industry for years menu knowledge is a MUST. Our server also sat down a few tables down from us and chatted it up with her friends and was playing on her phone. Just not very professional in my opinion after being in the business. Food was excellent once we got everything but service could have been much better."}
{"text":"We had horrendous service here on multiple occasions. Our server Cyanne messed up the price on our check 3 times. Each time we sent it back at least 30 minutes elapsed before she returned. No manager apology was given. Bathrooms are typically disgusting. Not impressed whatsoever."}
{"text":"The food here is your typical bar and pub. Bar food thats pretty good. Just remember its a bar with food. Young children would not fit in after 5 or 6."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit here after probably like 11 years.  The restuarant interior is centered around a large bar and there a couple of pool tables, but the pièce de résistance is the over sized jenga wood blocks that is set atop a wood table so when it crashes down as kids play it...well, you get the picture.  Just targeted for certain types patrons (3.5/5).   Now, the burgers we ordered were excellent (5/5) as were the fried Brussel sprouts with balsamic glazed and parmesan cheese (5/5). Service were not bad albeit they forgot to get me water once (5/5).   It was a good experience overall and it won't be 11 years till we try again."}
{"text":"Nice area for a party. Plenty of pool tables and fun. Drinks are reasonable, not too overpriced. Food is good. I especially liked the Southwest Chicken Roll Appetizers."}
{"text":"This place is a middle of the road bar. Nothing to special but they do have a lot of tvs for watching sports and some pool tables. I stopped by to grab some wings and catch the end of the playoff game and was half greeted by a hostess(if that's what she was) while she was on the phone and she silently mouthed that she needed my id. Then she said have fun so I just went off to seat myself. A waitress came over and took my wing order. I asked if they could do all drums and would even be fine paying an upcharge but she said they couldn't do that. They only had 2 wing size options: small and shareable. I got the shareable and received 12 smaller sized wings so just a heads up that you won't be sharing these with many people. Really surprised 12 wings costed me almost $17 so I was a bit disappointed. The Caribbean Jerk wings were good. The parm garlic wings had no flavor so I just requested some additional Jerk sauce and made them jerk wings as well. If I visit again, it'll probably be just for beer and watching games."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Fox & Hound in a while, and stopped in on Memorial Day with my gf & two out-of-town guests. It was really quiet in there, which was actually what we would have preferred for that night anyway.  Service was prompt and friendly, which based on my other visits here, is always the case regardless of level of business - although be reasonable, if it's slammed your food/drinks are going to take an extra minute.   We had wings (.45 on Monday nights) that were a little crispy for my taste, but still pretty good. Everyone's entrees arrived at the same time and hot, and the burgers were fantastic. Cooked just like we had ordered. There are plenty of TVs for live events, and this place is just as good as BWW/Hickory Tavern/etc for games in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"On a Saturday evening the place is not even half full, but a bar similar to Fox and Hound is packed to capacity to the point, they have ppl waiting to get in is literally in the same plaza.  This was the first time in years me and my wife ate there and it was a waste of our time and money....Revert back to my first sentence and it should have told us why it was hardly anyone in there...drinks over priced and food was a disappointment. How can you mess up a salad?  By drowning it with salad dressing. What restaurant/ bar doesn't give the dressing on the side? This place! Enter at your own risk. At least you can play pool."}
{"text":"I just got charged 9.50 for a single bottle of beer. Never again! You can see my receipt in the photo section. No wonder she tried to get me to start a tab. I would have had several before I knew it. Ripoff city. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Lots of Beers. Lots of TVs w/Sound. During football games, they have 2 rooms, each with 1 game's sound on. Raffles on game days. Free wi-fi. Great service. Food choices aren't too bad. I mean...what's there not to like about this place."}
{"text":"I usually visit this location for lunch or grab couple of drinks (after work of course) since it's very near to where I work in Ballantyne. So far, they have always welcomed us with big smile (real one). I am big fan of big smile if you don't know me by now :) I was here just last week with a good company for couple of drinks and they were great. We were just talking through out our time here and we ONLY ordered drinks but they didn't mind at all, most places wants you to order since servers get tip based on how much you spend. Server was friendly and she kept checking with us every few minutes.  I didn't gave it five star is because our server didn't close the deal right. She didn't thank us for visiting them when she left the bill."}
{"text":"Me and my friends often visit this location to watch our Panthers game. They have all flat screen TVs and couple of huge LCD TVs right on top of their bar. There are few tables out on their patio for out door lovers or smokers. This location has two private party room for groups or private party. I think meet-ups group had their last super bowl party here.   They have great beer special and they have few options for vegetarians which is one of my requirement to go out for lunch or dinner. Their veggie and chicken items are pretty good.   Their service is usually great but it depends on which server you get when you get seated. Most of the time we have had good service."}
{"text":"Convenient location and great initial impression. The ambience is entertaining with lots of televisions throughout the bar. This is a good place to host happy hours with coworkers and friends. The food was simply mouthwatering at a reasonable price. You must try the wings and other appetizers as you divulge into the spirits."}
{"text":"The food is ok noting out of the ordinary. Try the fresh baked great cookie blitz"}
{"text":"So you charge admission cause ur showing the UFC fight, but your playing a college FB game on the big screen and on the overhead audio. STUPID! Then the Mgr comes over (per my request) and politely offers to refund my money explaining that the \"football crowd\" will leave if he changes the game to the fight, & that they've been there since 7pm. Well as I scan the room, there are 5 empty tables & 3 empty booth's. 3x he offers a refund to which I reply that I don't want the money, I want what I paid for. The fight. He refused so I took the refund & gave it the the waitress since my 6 top was leaving right behind a 4 top that just left. Lol I called Hickory up the street. They had a 20 min wait for a table. They have something figured out."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best. Staff is not great at all. They seem very overwhelmed with the amount of tables they had on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Service was not good tonight even tho it was slow the waitress was 10xtimes slow. Menu has changed the wings were over cooked and I'm not impressed with the new french fries they are salty as hell!"}
{"text":"People, English Pubs are good fun, but English FOOD is CRAP.  So, why you would decide to add in the \"Grille\" feature to your cool English Pub is beyond me.  And true to form as an English Grille, the Fox & Hound's food was, well, pretty crappy.  I was given the choice of Subway or Fox and Hound for lunch today, and, admittedly, I would choose Fox and Hound over Subway again, but I'd probably just order a Guinness (Irish, I know) and call it lunch.    In *concept* the food at Fox and Hound sounds fine, \"a grilled turkey sandwich with apple smoked bacon, cheese, and a honey mustard dressing on a pretzel bun\" sounds pretty good.  In *practice* the bun was soggy and not so good, the \"bacon\" had the texture and composition of Bacos and grilled turkey had something so unpleasantly unappetizing in it that I just swallowed it and prayed.   My dining companion seemed to enjoy her meal, so perhaps the execution of my sandwich is sometimes better.    As a Pub, maybe the place is great, there were a few pool tables, several dart boards and the place had the dimly lit feel of your favorite pub in London (everybody has one of those, right?) although the cavernous space is distinctly American.  I can't imagine that this \"English\" pub, in a strip mall, ever gets really fun, or rockin'.  But, maybe, occasionally it does get a drunk old man humming a sea shanty or two.  Just as if it was a real English Pub.  Because the Brits are our allies, and the Pub serves Newcastle, I will give the Fox and Hound the benefit of the doubt here and go with two stars.    However, Fox and Hound English Pub & Grille (what's up with this faux-English spelling?) I will leave you with some wisdom from a man who spend much time in an actual English Pub, Sir Winston Churchill: \"However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.\"  Toodles."}
{"text":"Guacamole burger was JUICY! Lots of TVs."}
{"text":"Good bar with good Tuesday and Thursday beer prices. The fish and chips are horrible. Took some visitors from Boston there and I was embarassed. I will go there to drink but never to eat. I have heard that the wings were good though."}
{"text":"This place has a nice look and feel.   It really could be cool but my first time tonight just....wasnt.  There were scowls on the staffs faces, the service was slow and the place was a ghost town.  Will try again maybe it's an off night but its a friday night , woah ..."}
{"text":"Came here tonight I didn't know what to expect however this was a really cool sports bar it was nice and clean the atmosphere was good I was surprised to see how many people were here on a Tuesday night I didn't try any food just played pool but I definitely will be back to try food and drinks"}
{"text":"This place had many empty tables and we were seated quickly. Lots of tvs with different channels. Ordered the black bean burger, fish and chips, and a buffalo chicken sandwich. Apart from the fish and chips being a little bread-y and extra fried, the food was great! Fries are hot, chicken is cooked perfectly, NOT squishy, soggy or over sauced. Don't be afraid of the Brussels sprouts, they are super delicious. Fresh corn on the bean burger-yum!"}
{"text":"Gross! Worst food ever! Ordered a French dip, why was my meat bleeding so much that my bread became soggy?! That is beyond gross! Will never be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very good food, very good service and good atmosphere. Was looking for an Irish local pub, and this was the closest thing nearby. Ordered the grilled cheese with bacon sandwich, and substituted the tomato soup for chili. The grilled cheese was great, well above the average. But the star of the show was the chili. It was loaded with flavor, and spicy too. One of the employees indicated the one of the ingredients was Guinness. It is a no-bean chili with lots of beef and jalapeno. Also, they have quite a few draft beers, some unusual ones."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out after work..They have a pretty good selection of beer and food.  Especially the appetizers :P   Check out their happy hour specials !"}
{"text":"The second bite of my pizza was 70% uncooked dough.  Mushy, nastly, slimy dough.  Although the environment is cool & the beer is reasonably priced for the area, every meal I've had there has not been good.  On top of that, you have to pay to rent the ping-pong paddles & darts.   Although probably not relevant to the service, every member of the help staff is an attractive woman with a low-cut shirt.   The pizza, the wait staff & the pay-to-play ping pong are what I remember most of this place - not worth recommending."}
{"text":"This was my second stop when i came into the area.  Moved up from Greenville SC.  I got there and all the tv's were a big plus.  The servers are all different and as there some rude ones, some are super helpful and friendly.  The specials are good Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Friday and Saturday night also good but the other weekdays without football are really slow."}
{"text":"We visited this location with a group early one Saturday night. After reading the more recent reviews we were reluctant to eat here but this is where the group was meeting so we didn't have a choice. Well we should have went with our gut. This was our 2nd visit to this location. The first visit was just for drinks late one Saturday night approx 3 months prior to the last visit. At that time it was very clean, we had good service and more importantly good drinks and food. This time we found this place to be very disorganized, dirty, bad service, bad drinks and just okay food. Walking in there was no one at the hostess station as we waited there for about ten minutes we had to go in and ask for someone. When we were seated we were next to 2 large tables of about 12 people each which were leaving. It took another 10 minutes for a waitress to show up to take our drink order and then another 15 minutes for our iced down drinks that the whole table said that they didn't think there was any alcohol in our drinks. Again this was a Saturday night and it was dead. The 2 tables of 12 people that left were left dirty with dishes and glasses for over 3 hours as we sat there. The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting. The only reason for 2 stars is the food was the only fair thing about this place even though half the table said their food was delivered cold. Needless to say we will not be back unless we see an \"Under New Management\" sign. A couple words for this location as a previous owner of a small Restaraunt. Clean House! Fire current management! Can someone say it's time for John Taffer before it's too late!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Heated patio, dining area, bar area and a backroom. It has a place for everyone! Awesome drink specials especially on Tuesday, $2, $3 and $4 drafts!! Staff is great and very friendly! I will definitely go back! Best late night in Huntersville!"}
{"text":"Cool spot.. come here often with friends to have a few drinks and sometimes dinner. This is nested in Birkdale village, and the only place open faithfully until 2am.. so if your looking for a night cap they are there waiting on you!   Sometimes they have live music, which is cool but can be a bit noisy if your just trying to relax. The food menu is decent and you can get bar food, or a a real decent meal. I'll be back to hang and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"We go there several times a year. The service is very good. Like the Tuesday $2. beer night.  Today we ordered the baked pretzels with our beers.  The beer was good as usual  but baked pretzels were dripping with grease. By far the worst ever. We did not complain but would not order again. Pricey base on value."}
{"text":"This is a sorority ran facility. I was uncomfortable the majority of the time I was there. Lots of pool tables is nice. The clientele is all male and I'm not surprised with the staff they have. I will not go back to this Baileys/Fox and the Hound."}
{"text":"Fox and the Hound has a great, standard beer selection.  You're not going to find any crazy/cool beer on draft, but they do have a very wide selection.   Food is standard bar selection, but generally good.  Try the pretzels - they are best thing on the menu.  I prefer the food for lunch, but happy hour works too.    Tuesday night is trivia night, which is very fun and pretty challenging."}
{"text":"I've been to the Fox & Hound a thousand times. Well, not literally speaking this location or even this exact franchise, but I've been to plenty other bars eerily similar to this exact establishment a countless number of times.   I've seen this same setup before; big screen TV's, pool tables and dart boards. The same unoriginal faces having the same boring conversations. I've seen the same Valley Girlish bartenders before with the same spaced out mentality. I've even seen this menu before. It's been done over and over again all throughout this country. There is nothing ground breaking here. No one is changing the world or inspiring new ideas here.   It goes without saying that the company you keep or the people you come here with will ultimately define your experience at the Fox & Hound. Just don't expect anything over and above your original expectations. It's mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Went last night to watch the game with some friends.  Showed up at 8:30 and there was a decent enough crowd.  Sat at a long, high top table on the restaurant side.  Waitress showed up quickly and was attentive throughout our visit.    We ordered a sampler platter of food which was basic bar food.....boneless wings with hot BBQ sauce were decent.  Friend cheese triangles were pretty gross, pretzel sticks were eatable. Nothing fancy, but I didn't expect it to be and it met my expectations.  I'd go back to watch a game.  I'd probably order something different off the menu though."}
{"text":"Considering I lived in Mayfield Heights for two years, I feel like I've been here a million times. It's just so damn convenient.   Unfortunately, that's pretty much the only reason I have been there so many times. The menu consists of typical bar food and I can never really seem to decide on anything that I really want.   For alcohol choices, a little word to the wise - be wary of mixed drinks. They are definitely not strong and sometimes even seem watered down. It takes way too many drinks for me to even begin to feel any effect of the liquor. I have to remind myself to stick to beer here. They have an okay selection and you definitely get more bang for your buck.   The biggest plus - they have drink specials every day (we usually stopped in on $2 draft night - especially when Great Lakes Christmas Ale is on tap!).   Although usually nice and attentive, the servers are not typically very knowledgeable.   They have table games (my friends love the ping pong!) and 3 separate rooms, which helps keep some of the noise level down. They have karaoke a couple nights a week in the back room - it gets pretty loud then.  All of that said, it's a pretty comfortable atmosphere to get together a small or large group of friends. Just don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"Had a blast tonight!! Love love love Laura!!! She took such great care of us!!!!! Amazing server!!!! Definitely ask to sit in her section if you're fortunate enough to make it there!! Good food and cold beer!!! What more can you ask for!!!"}
{"text":"Ok food. Slow service. Table was dirty and silverware was dirty also. Very limited food menu. Plenty of other good choices in the area. It's really just a bar with bar food."}
{"text":"Definitely a bar for the young ..... despite reviews on the poor service we figured we'd give it a try anyway - the service was painfully slow!!!! Let me repeat painfully SLOW!!!! It was nearly 25 mins before our water arrived and that was only after flagging down any waitstaff in sight to help us.    We ordered the tots (average at best); the Tuscan flatbread pizza which was good and the Barbacoa  tacos which were delish! We originally ordered the southwest chicken rolls which they were sold out of but tried to charge us for them anyway   Our waitress Simone apologized profusely for the slow service but never really picked up the pace ---- I asked for ketchup for our tots n they were half eaten by the time she brought it after asking her again    Josh the manager listened patiently to my feedback and promptly discounted our food bill by 50% - go Josh and then he promised it would be better our next time!   Hmmmmm not so sure we'll return but thanks anyway.     The big take away is this if you are in no kind of hurry at all then yeah try em out but if you have things to do people to see and places to go keep moving past this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Birkdale....the cornburbs version of Southpark in Charlotte.  Nice, upscale...pretty people and pretty places.  The Fox and Hound is your typical \"Oak and Brass\" type bar....with worn carpets and slow service.  The menu is lack luster and probably not very healthy.  This place is a bit \"mainstream\" for such a nice shopping place, but serves as a big watering hole for the locals.  I ate here and wasn't impressed.....hopefully I'll never get too plastered and fall down on the carpet which looked VERY scary.  Good luck folks with this one........"}
{"text":"I stopped in to watch a game one Saturday afternoon. It was almost empty. The waitress was extremely nice.  The food was good for bar food though it was kind of pricey for bar food. The portion sizes were decent but not large.   One thing that bothered me is they changed our TV with only a few seconds left in the game.  With only a few people in the bar and that many TVs, you think they would have asked us before changing anything."}
{"text":"It feels like the beginnings of the end. Our initial greeting was poor at best and we waiting a few to many minutes to be seated in the empty vestibule. We learned there was a private party in the dining room so we were seated at a high top without any explanation. The decor is dreary and barely meets a poor expectation of a sports bar. The ladies restroom was dirty and there were puddles of water (I hope) on the floor. There was a game on and the bar was busy. The bar had no wine glasses and my wine was served in a dirty water glass. I tried to speak with our server about it but she dropped it and bolted. I was looking forward to my order selection or i would have left. I ordered the dilemma chicken sandwich and i must say - it was good!  The Brussels were a little soggy but still tasty. The fish and chips were sad; they used to be large hand breaded and delish. Now they seem like the Gordon's Fisherman delivered them from the frozen food section of the Harris Teeter. Our server informed us that she was training so she and her trainer would be visiting. Ok - no worries, everyone learns sometime. Yet we didn't see either server for the majority of our meal. She returned once but only because we made eye contact. The chicken sandwich was good, sadly not worth the hassle and gross bathroom."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place for late night grub. I love that the kitchen is open late and serves the full menu! Service was pretty good even though they were out of grilled veggies. I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I have a good time here. Shoot pool, drink beer, eat decent bar food. The dj always sucks"}
{"text":"Truly and sincerely want this place to improve; it's got such potential! Love going here due to its convenience, atmosphere, and menu.  Staff is friendly.  But there are never enough servers, service is slow, crowd is often shady, and what could be a delicious menu is poorly executed.  Potentially excellent food often arrives cold.  I keep going to show support for this business that I want to see thrive, but always leave underwhelmed and frustrated."}
{"text":"Omg,another meltdown at fox Ballantyne ..servers getting own drinks and washing glasses. . Peeps waiting 10 15 mins and not even spoken to and walking out. Joe only bartender as poor Mary is in shift change. 3 more just left... who runs /manages this place?Do they not know it's St.Patrick's day ? Not a manager to be seen assisting. Shd be a \"all hands on deck\" day. My glass has been empty for 14 mins now. Nobody to see it...so sad... Server washing glasses got me a beer in hot glass. Great ...lotta peeps cashing out....6 more gone. Now they have 3  bartenders on hand, little late I guess...."}
{"text":"This is now a fox and hound but really just a name change everything else is the same. It was empty in there but service was still a little slow. I got the naked tenders and a side salad. My girlfriend got a burger and fries. After a lengthy wait our food came out and mine was all wrong. The gave me fried tenders and fries oops! I said no fries and naked tenders means grilled. Back they go and after another lengthy wait I get the tenders with more fries no biggie. My side salad had a half frozen tomato and the Italian dressing looked like a giant snot ball(yummy) the tenders were ok and the buffalo sauce tasted great but very spicy. My girlfriend said the burger was just ok and the Parmesan fries not very good. When getting the check of course it was wrong, they tried to charge me for the drunken tender entree. I told them this and they fixed but the manager said to make up for it they took half the cost of my side salad off(it was $2). They didn't but at that point I didn't care and it was time to go. So no I won't be going back."}
{"text":"It's an older styled sports bar with a strong selection of 100 beers.  3 types of Chimay is awesome.  Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale is my favorite beer.  The service is average.  No major issues.  It's also fairly dark even during the day.  Maybe they can brighten it somehow.  I didn't have any food so I can't comment."}
{"text":"Sorry, very poor service.  Over an hour for nachos. We cancelled and went elsewhere for food."}
{"text":"The ULTIMATE BURGER is absolutely amazing!!! My experience at fox and hound Ballantyne was great!!!!"}
{"text":"Just your typical American style pub, with average food, and lots of beer. If all you want is a giant burger, some fries, and a cold beer, all while watching 12 TVs, this is your place."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything bad about this place, but I cant think of anything that's really good either.  They have decent drink specials and a decent atmosphere, but sometimes the beer can be not so cold and the liquor can taste mixed (i.e., rum tastes like someone poured cheap tequila in it on accident when consolidating bottles).  Service is hit or miss, but always a miss when you sit outside.  You'll see the waitress maybe 3 times an hour, and never when you really need him/her.  The service inside is much better usually.   Overall, this is a decent place to stop in for a drink or quick dinner if you're walking around Birkdale, but the other restaurants and bars surrounding it have more to offer. Average."}
{"text":"It's pretty bad. Been a few times to watch games (the back room has a good TV setup) and the food is subpar. Our most recent trip we were served raw chicken so we won't be back."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here but knowing I have a spine injury and my companion is completely disabled they would only allow high top bar seating. The low tops were completely open. We left without being able to eat. They simply declined to assist us."}
{"text":"I am usually not this dissatisfied with restaurants, even if I have poor service, but this place is an exception. Our waitress acted as if she were intoxicated, asking us several times to repeat our order without writing it down or repeating it back to us to confirm.  I then caught our waitress in a lie. I specifically ordered corn tortillas for my chicken tacos and flour tortillas were what came out. When I asked about it, she then told me \"the ticket definitely said flour tortillas, so they're probably flour\" I responded with \"I ordered corn tortillas because I can't have flour\". She went to the back to ask the cook what he made, and came back out saying \"I definitely put corn on the ticket and he made it flour tortillas\".  To top it off I also ordered chicken nachos, and they came out cold. My chicken and cheese were cold and hard. I will not be coming back here. Sorry Fox n Hound."}
{"text":"I wish I could have taken photos, but unfortunately I was there for a meeting and did not want to look unprofessional. I did get to try all these items from the appetizer buffet: Tower of Rings, Jacked Up Cheese Wedges, Chips & Salsa, and their basic pizza (can't find the menu name). It was all typical, nothing outta this world.  The real downer was my the Reuben sandwich. Presentation was nice, but really? $10 for cold pastrami, a tablespoon of sauerkraut, and un-melted Swiss cheese? No thank you! What I've learned from this one visit is to only go there if you have too, and only munch on appetizers if you do."}
{"text":"Look, I love this place. I love the vibe, the setting, the beers, people that come here. I wish they would invest a little more in their food and customer service. My coconut shrimp was served with ranch dressing, it was over-fried and had a weird hot sauce dressing to it. Wings were ... eh. The waitress also acted really annoyed with every interaction. Hope for a better experience next time, cause again I do love this place!! One in Northlake rocks. Hopes for another good one in Pineville"}
{"text":"I had one of my best nights in any bar here.  They have stepped up the game.  I can't comment on the food as I haven't eaten any."}
{"text":"This was an awful experience. If I could give less than 1 star, I would. Upon placing drink orders, we were rushed. My hubby asked if Budweiser was available and was told NO and ordered an alternate. After looking at the drink menu in depth, Budweiser was available so that was ordered and brought. Outdoor tables were dirty and sticky. Service very slow. The Southwest Cobb was soo spicy (and I LOVE spicy food) yet it was too hot to eat. Zero reference was made to a heat factor on the menu. My hubby ordered sweet potato fries with his yet regular fries came. My meal was replaced with a suitable non-spicy version after another long delay. My hubby, ever the gentleman, sat waiting with his food getting cold. Sooo... we were compensated with one round of drinks on the house and a coupon for a free appetizer to return. Who would return for this? AWFUL!! So not worth it at all!!"}
{"text":"Met up with some co-workers after work for happy hour recently.  The space is quite large offering a few different rooms and theme nights on certain weeknights.  The one thing I did notice upon entering was the musty odor that filled the entire place.  It was almost as if I was going back in time to a dive bar during my college days.    The drinks were average for happy hour specials and I ended up trying the southwest rolls off the appetizer menu.  It was quite an odd arrangement of sushi like pieces when it was served and had an odd texture to it. Many of my co-workers swear by this place, but I don't get the appeal."}
{"text":"Sports bar with usual bar type food, although they have a large menu with a lot of variety. Plenty of beer on tap and the staff is very nice. Must be that southern charm I am not quite used to. The manager Mike is pretty cool too :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. Not so crowded during the day but usually packed in the evening.  Great waitstaff. Food is decent. Portion size for fries could be bigger. (Fill up the cup!)   If you sit near either of the doors on a cold day, you WILL be cold.   Sports fans, there are enough televisions around the room to have you covered no matter where you sit.  If you drink alcohol, they have you covered. Big bar with lots of bottles.  Parking on the front isn't my cup of tea. If you're good at backing in, you're good to go. If you have to pull into the space, you'll have to back out into the driving area, where cars are driving in both directions and there are cars parked on the other side of the lot.   The lot is really too narrow for all that action and I wonder how safe it is at night, when visibility might not be as good and folk have been drinking.  I prefer to park on the \"back\" lot, where there's more space in the driving lanes (but you still need to be careful of those driving back and forth)."}
{"text":"I can't believe this company still has business .  Never can have a good eating experience here.. Food service is sub par...."}
{"text":"A great place to go play pool in Charlotte.  Always friendly staff and great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat and hang out in Birkdale! The GM Chris is awesome! Staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"An exceptionally awful experience. I wish I could comment on the food or drinks or any of it, but we simply didn't receive any.  I also find it difficult to comment on the service, because we never actually received any. We sat ourselves, which was fine. Eventually, a young man brought us water. About 10 minutes later, a waitress showed up to take our drink order. Another 15 minutes later, she came back to see how we were doing. I told her we never received our drinks. She apologized, made some sort of excuse and then completely disappeared. We gave it another 15 minutes before leaving. A complete and utter waste of time, and probably the worst \"service\" I have ever received."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon. Not alot of cars in the parking lot so we were not even sure if they were open. When we walked in no one greeted or came over to direct us. A customer on her way out actually stopped and said \"I m pretty sure they would tell u to just sit any where\" . So we wandered around dodging the construction and found a table. A male server finally came up to us and said someone will b right with you.  About 10 mins later a female came over to take our drink orders.  She was friendly. I took the opportunity to go ahead and or an appetizer. Thank goodness!  It took longer than I would have expected to get our drinks considering the place wasn't busy.    Our appetizer and waitress? took forever to reappear. I almost went looking for her. She did finally come back and dropped off our ap and then ran away without taking our order.  My husband was not happy but I told him maybe we should take this as a sign and just get the check and leave.  She finally came back once we were done with the ap and at that point I just asked for the check. Again it took longer than it should have for the place to be empty. We almost left cash and walked out.  Not sure what was going on so after we paid and left we found another restaurant to actually have lunch at..We had much better service."}
{"text":"I'm watching your staff pet dogs. Smoke cigarettes on the patio. Management sat down with them. And then go to a table to serve them.   Disgusting. Raise your standard."}
{"text":"The entire experience was mediocre at best. They seemed to be out of every liquor or beer I wanted. It took at least 20 minutes to get every drink I ordered. The server was somewhat pleasant, but I could tell she was overwhelmed. The place was severely under staffed."}
{"text":"This fox and hound is just like any fox and hound around.  There's beer pong, darts, billiards, and a great selection of beer!  The food is definitely delicious and goes well with a nice cold glass of draft beer.  The high top tables are pretty close together which would be annoying on a busy day.  The server we had was very nice and accommodating to all our needs.  He kept coming to our table to make sure we were ok and to see if we needed anything to go with our delicious meals.  I usually get the drunken tenders bc the beer battered chicken always tickled my fancy.  It was so crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  Over the years I've noticed that the tenders did get a bit smaller than usual.  The Parmesan fries were also very tasty that came with the drunken tenders dinner meal.  My husband and friend got the fish and chips and they said it was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside as well.  The filets were quite large which was exciting for them since they got to take some leftovers home. The only thing that kind of sucks is that they no longer honor the all star cards so if you had a lot of points at one point, say goodbye to al your previous perks. Other than that, great service, booze, and food!"}
{"text":"To start off with the positive, my lunch was pretty good. That was the only decent thing about our trip. It took at least 20 minutes to be acknowledged, and once our waitress took our drink orders, it took her quite some time to come back. I had to get up from the table and ask her to take our orders, because at this point it was already at least 30-40 minutes into our 1 hour lunch break. We never got water refills. We had to ask for straws. One burger came without mayo. It was never mentioned that sides were an extra charge, and she put all 7 of our orders on one check. So as we're already late to get to back to work, she comes back and asks us all again what we ordered. Our waitress might have been in over her head, but for only having 6 full tables and maybe 5 visible staff, they should know how to turn tables during the lunch hour within 30 minutes. Again, the food was enjoyable, but I definitely won't return again to this location for lunch because it will take 1.5 hours. Very disappointing service."}
{"text":"Dirty, dirty, dirty. This place needs a good scrubbing, from the bathroom to the booths this place is gross.  The main dining room smells kinda like urine and the food is nothing exceptional. Two star because the staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Half of martini's on Wednesday!! Mediocre food. Definitely a flavorless spinach and artichoke dip!!! Burgers and fries normal franchise taste."}
{"text":"This is a tough one. Mixed between 2 and 3 stars. Went with three I guess because I'm a nice guy and I'm a member of the All Star Club and I get free stuff...  My buddies and I typically stop by on Tuesday nights since the draft beers only cost a crisp two dollar bill. The food is pretty good. One friend had a bit of an issue with the bacon on his burger not being cooked well enough, that was disappointing... The shredded chicken tacos I had recently were pretty tasty.  Not a fan of the bathroom, sort of a mess. The outside facade was done well by the complex, but the inside still seems like the same ol dingy Bailey's."}
{"text":"I know I'm a minority here, but I hate bars with TVs everywhere.  What ever happened to simple human interaction?  I also was unaware that they were a chain.  Where have I been?  On the upside, the beer is good with lots of local and craft beer options.  The food is typical bar food but is tasty.  I've had their Jacked-Up Cheese Wedges and Pretzels with Beer Cheese.  Not bad.  If you want good beer and food this isn't a bad option, but there are better, LOCAL places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"It's not that often that I'll get up to the Birkdale area.  In fact, I probably wouldn't have been there this time if we hadn't been meeting some friends.  I even had to - gasp - Google the address to try and find the place.  Good thing I knew we were going to Birkdale or I probably would have ended up at the other Fox and Hound.  Anyway, I will say that Birkdale is pretty cool, as far as shopping centers go.  It just has that vibe to it.  Of course, I don't live anywhere near it, and the best thing I have for comparison is - gasp again - Eastland, which is about shuttered these days, so what do I know?  The restaurant itself suffers from a split personality - much like a Hickory Tavern if you've been there, but it's actually more split here, with a real split between the bar and the dining areas, where Hickory Tavern is a single open concept.  Fox and Hound gives you a bar and a restaurant, which is nice if you want one or the other and not both.  While this means that you can enjoy your food without quite so much noise and smoke in your food, it also means that the service can suffer, and I'm not just talking about on game day.  I'm talking on a lazy Saturday afternoon.  Keep that in mind.  The food is pretty average, so I'd agree with others who say that you would probably be better going elsewhere for that and coming here for the bar or the game."}
{"text":"To whom it may concern,  I am appalled by tonight. I have been a patron for 3 years at your Birkdale location. I have come to know many of your staff (BOH to FOH) and like to think of it as the \"Cheers\" of the area. Huntersville is a very tight-knit community and in saying this, everybody knows your name.  I visited tonight, as I do, once a week for Trivia. My server couldn't have been better. I've been in the service industry for years on years. I know guest service. She was PHENOMENAL.  Unfortunately, that's not the case...  To be totally transparent, one of your servers is an ex-girlfriend of a close friend of mine. As we all know, things don't always work out for the best. Regardless, I've stayed true to my local pub and continued to give my support, time, and money..  While in your establishment, I was assaulted!  Enjoying a fun night, NO. A server, by the name of Stephanie Taggart, threw a napkin towards my table. She then proceeded to throw a beer on me in passing! Thank my lucky stars, I wasn't in business attire. Humiliated and very upset, I notified to closest manager..Dan (I apologize for not knowing his last name). Dan informed me that Stephanie said there was some 'back n forth'...I'm guessing we had spoke to one another or something to that effect. No. Dan, did not apologize for the actions that took place and he didn't so much as offer me a napkin/towel to dry my back or my seat, which was saturated with left over beer. Instead, made me feel totally uncomfortable being there.  I regret to inform you, I can't put myself in this situation again."}
{"text":"Chose this location the night UNC played Syracuse to watch the game and have some food. The drink specials were pretty good and decently priced. The service was slow which was understandable because they were kind of busy, our waiter tried his best. The food was just average nothing to write home about and the atmosphere was good. We will definitely go back to this location again."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and the beer is cold. Have to give a thumbs down on the food though. I had the mahi mahi, chicken & rice soup, and macaroni and cheese. The fish was ok but the mac and cheese was warm on top and cold in the center. The chicken & rice soup was pretty bland. A friend of mine had a Philly cheesesteak that used GROUND BEEF. This place may be a great venue for watching sports and drinking beer, but the food needs improvement."}
{"text":"I always come to fox n hound and have never had a problem with the service until last night. I came in with my guy friend and was ignored by our waitress jackie. She was rude and didn't even acknowledge me sitting at the table. Being someone who works in the restaurant business there is nothing more disrespectful than ignoring the female and hitting on the guy. And on top of that we would wait like 15 minutes for her to come back to refill our drinks again asking him first and barely acknowledging me until I spoke up!   I'm very unsatisfied and disgusted with the service; because of Jackie I will not be in as much especially with my guy friends. I will also be telling my friends about this because I wouldn't want them to be disrespected as well! If you are taking your boyfriend or guy friend into fox be cautious if Jackie is your waitress you will be ignored if your the woman.   Fox should also invest in teaching the servers proper etiquette."}
{"text":"Its a lively bar that picks up later in the evening.  Did not eat anything here, but came to enjoy a few drinks on their patio.  Smoking is permitted on the patio, so perfect time to light up a cigar. Beer and cocktails abundant but lacking in the single malt selection.    The highlight of the place is the service, the crowd, the late nite DJ ..and the patio for us cigar smokers..."}
{"text":"Food was not fresh, like out of a box frozen. Cold, hard stale bread. Cold fries. Rude server and slow service. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Your staff is horrendous to say the least. I will be filing complaints to the BBB, health department, and whom ever will listen (or watch the videos). I have a Video of all of the following. Your bartender completely ignoring our party of two, as we are speaking directly too her, and her making us repeat ourselves 3 times and still didn't answer our question. I confronted her about her lack of attention and being disrespectful. She stated it was busy and that other people needed her attention too we weren't the only people there. There were 6 people total sitting at the bar including our party. Even then she continued to have her conversation with the manager about (Facebook, instagram ect.) One of the employees at the establishment knew my friend who I had come to pick up from there. She (the employee) left without paying her tab. The bar tender proceeded to tell us that someone needed to pay it and it wasn't going to be coming out of her money. I explained to the bartender that if she made an arrangement for her co worker to come back and pay that is not our responsibility. After about ten min of conversation and the bartender speaking to us like we were animals I asked to speak to the manager. The bartender refused to close out my friends tab until either her co worker came back or we paid for her drinks. The manager never came, the bartender continued to be excessively rude. Slamming things around ect. Finally after being stuck in your establishment against our will for 45 min with the manager no where in sight.. the employee who left her tab open arrived. On the way back from using the filthy restroom, with a hole in the wall where there used to be a urinal and the sink that looked like a crew of diesel mechanics came through, I saw the manager on my way back to the front of the restaurant. I stopped and asked her if she was the manager. She was in the process of asking the cook to make her food stating. \"You know I'm a good person ill pay you back.\" Also at this point the employee who had left is now standing there and so is the bartender. I asked to speak with her and ask her if this was normal practice for your bartender to say to a guest who has never been to the establishment before (or even someone that knew the employee) has to pay for an employees drink who walked out on there tab. After I said that I had never visited the establishment before the bartender who is standing to the side says \"YES YOU HAVE\" and I again told her that I had not at which point she has thrown her arms in the air and storms away. At that same time the cook who the manager was just bribing sticks his head out of a service window and says (he also sounded intoxicated) \"I've heard him being very disrespectful the entire time\". Now don't get me wrong I was not very pleased that we were forced to stay there while the bartender withheld my friends credit card, but i was not disrespectful. At that point I had informed the manager that I had been recording this circus act unfolding in front of me. Her response was \"awesome\". As she sputtered making no sense something about the bartender and it being her friend, she proceeded to tell me \"I didn't have time for this or you right now, I appreciate that so go back and watch your video\". And walked away. I've tried to explain in the best of my ability what had transpired that night but the videos are unbelievable. I will never again visit a Baileys, I frequent Fox and Hound regularly with work functions and your bartenders there are less than favorable but bearable. I would appreciate a rapid response to this issue, preferably a phone call, and I never want anyone to have to deal with such barbaric people as my friend and I have. You might want to think about new staff. Especially the manager stealing food from your company. I believe her name was Lisa."}
{"text":"Service isn't terrible but could be worked on. Drink specials are good, they have lots of TV's for game day! Fox and Hound is much MUCH better than the sister CO. Bailey's."}
{"text":"Went in last night with my wife and 22 year old son. The only tables available where in the bar, so we checked them out. Unfortunately, my wife has a bad back and the bar chairs where built to dangle ones feet.   We asked to wait for a booth in the dinning section and where informed by the hostess reluctantly that \"people are eating and stuff.\" Go figure.  Well, hardly hiding my giggle, we all couldn't get out fast enough. One waiter offered graciously to bring out a handicap bar table, but we just left.  We went to Red Robin and enjoyed wonderful service. Tipped the waitress $20 on a $65 bill. I made sure to tell her she's the best server I have had in months."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here at Fox and Hound trying to enjoy their $2 drafts and try some of their food. I have been here for over an hour and our waitress has come to our table 3 times. Once to take our drink and beer orders, once to deliver them, and once to get us a refill. I had to call her over to our table to tell her my food was cold when she brought it. Then, after she took it back and the manager brought out the re-cook, I had almost finished my food before she came over to ask how it was and to offer me another Guiness. I had an empty glass for at least 15 min... She hasn't even told us her name but, she has maybe 3 tables. I watched her walk to-and-from one of her other tables 4 times before she came to check on us after I got the re-cook. Not too sure about coming back here again.  After writing this review, the server completely changed within less than 5 min and both managers were on the floor. Complete 180 of how it was before. Still not sure about this place if it takes posting a review before getting proper service."}
{"text":"Went in this afternoon, and after watching Bar Rescue Im much more aware of things. First, took 10 mns to get the server. Ask for drink recommendation and was served in the same glasses I bought at Walmart with a white straw. No drink glass or drink straw..thumbs down. Ordered the boneless buffalo wings, took 20 mins to get the food. It comes out in a stand that you serve fries in. Food was awful, and was more like chicken nuggets. The drink had no liquor in it.  I wont be going back. Its too bad because I have had food there before and drinks and it was decent.  Oh yea, the cherry on top is that Ive had gas for 5 hrs since eating there. UGH!!!!"}
{"text":"The place was clean with friendly bar maid. The F&H also boasts nice pool tables and good food BUT in July how do you not have A/C??? Would have stayed but sweat running down my back is not where I can relax!!!."}
{"text":"Food was decent...definitely gone down over the years BUT service was better than in the past. Our server, Taylor K., was so sweet and wonderful; would come back to have the staff that was here tonight."}
{"text":"This is a fun spot for a game of pool or to grab some beers.  The atmosphere is that of a bar and I was happy to stop in for dinner and some drinks.  The service was pretty good.  The food was decent - I had a cup of chili and a grilled cheese sandwich and both were pretty tasty.  I can't say I'd be a regular here, but it was a decent spot for an after work happy hour in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Walked in and asked for a table outside. I sat down immediately and watched 5 young workers ignore me for 5 minutes. So, I walked inside and it was freezing cold and there was no one available to seat me. A business networking event/meetup was going on and I walked out. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  Monday nights, at least last night was, buy 10 wings get 10 free so that was a pleasant surprise.  The women working behind the bar are very easy on the eyes and pretty cool to talk to.  The food here is probably par for a pub, nothing really stands out.  The liquor prices are about $4 for well and about the same for a draft.    Tuesday nights are draft night which equates to $2 any draft.  The two pool rooms tend to be a sausage fest / tool chest, but I guess thats why they built a room to remove them from the general drunk population.  It's definitely a lot bigger on the inside then it appears from the parking lot.  I frequent this place during the college football season because U of M Alumni Assoc. meets there for the games."}
{"text":"I have been going to Bailey's for two years to watch the UFC pay-per-view events.  Their food is good, beer selection is good, they have good specials, and the atmosphere is good.  They have tons of TV screens, too.   So, why did I only give them two stars?  The bathroom.  The men's room is the most filthy, disgusting, poorly-designed atrocity I've ever seen.  It reminds me of the \"TOILET\" in Trainspotting.  There are two urinals that are six inches apart.  Two people cannot use them at the same time because they're too close together, and there is no divider.  The last time I was in there, the dividing wall around the toilet had been pulled almost completely out of the wall, too.   I will overlook a lot of things, but this is just the worst ever."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, it's a very convenient place for me and friends to meet for lunch and catch up.  The food is always great, service is good.  Unfortunately I have had to remove them from places that I can eat at as they have chosen to post against lawful concealed carry.  There are many other places in the area that I will patronize.  Hopefully they will see their error and change their minds."}
{"text":"Great local sports bar with plenty of TVs to watch sporting events on.  I love there black and blue burger combined with a blue moon.  Been here with large parties as well and they are very accommodating and quick with service.  Can be a bit loud but what would you expect for a sports bar.  They have outside seating which is nice in the summer so you can bring your pets if needed."}
{"text":"Went to watch a game and found the place to be a nice place to watch a game.  The service was pretty decent, but the food came out all at the same time (appetizers and meal) so that was awkward.  Manager did offer us a free appetizer next time we came in, but it was still poor timing.  Waitress said \"Want me to put in in the window to keep warm, or just have them remake it?\" but it felt awkward to say \"yes\" so we just packed up the apps in a to-go box.  Ugh.    So, our table had artichoke dip appetizer, which comes with tortilla chips and salsa.  The salsa tasted fresh, but somewhat sweet.  The art dip was just ok, didn't taste homemade.  The chips we had were burnt and brown.  Very acrid tasting.    For dinner I had the tomato soup and bacon grilled cheese.  The sandwich was good, but the soup tasted like tomato sauce, thick and spiced with Italian spices.  I'll not do that again.  My friend had Fish and chips and said it was really yummy.  We had to ask for drink refills and look for our waitress a few times.  I still enjoyed watching the game, and will go back to see if it is better the next time."}
{"text":"Nothing really special about this place.  The bar food was probably a little subpar but I wasn't expecting much.  Thought the pool tables were pretty well maintained aside from the fact that there isn't very many pool tables to begin with.   If you're looking for a typical place to hang out, this looks like it. Beer, bar food, pool, and some huge tv screens to watch games.  dmo out"}
{"text":"Forgot this place was there... And will forget it again.  The boneless wings taste like McDonald's chicken nuggets.  The grilled cheese and tomato soup wasn't bad and the small beers were only two bucks.... It wasn't enough to make up for the dreadful service and disgusting boneless wings."}
{"text":"I liked this place, some of the food is just OK but other food here like the Stacked burger tastes amazing (its a burger that has bacon on it and some blue cheese). The onion rings here are tasty, and you can go here and watch a game on any one of their multiple TV's. My one negative on this place is that sometimes it gets busy (they have a cheap beer pitcher night on Tuesday I think) to the point where it is overly crowded. The other thing is that some of their TV's like their big screen projectors just look so outdated; like you can barely see anything.  Pros:  Great Burgers Pool Tables Ping Pong Table Multiple TV Screens Price (this place is relatively cheap)  Cons: Can get crowded at times Servers are sometimes too busy where it takes you a while to order"}
{"text":"Bartender Jessica is awesome. A true asset to the bar! Super friendly, patient, offered up some great advice and let us try a good selection of beer before we ordered, since we felt like having something different.   The food is also reaalllyyy good.   I would give this place 5 stars, excpet the fact that a tall bud light is $5.50, which is overpriced in my book. Better off getting a more expensive/ stronger beer for $7.   I recommend the place."}
{"text":"I went here after playing laser tag.  Seating was quick, but there was about 12 of us in our group.  The drinks took forever to serve and when mine didn't come out, (an easy draft to pour), I inquired.  She said the bartender at the bar was busy, but there wasn't many people sitting at the bar and the place wasn't that packed.  (she forgot and didn't want to fess up to it). When I expressed my unsatisfaction,, she just said sorry and didn't even act like I was a big deal.  I advised I didn't want to order food if it was going to take that long to get a drink alone, asked for my check, paid, and left."}
{"text":"The pineapple upside down cake cocktail was super FAB,  for the entree tried the Jamaican chicken which was good.  But the cocktail made the evening."}
{"text":"Usually am happy with this location, but the temperature of the restaurant definitely makes me wish I had a jacket. brrrrrrrrr. We asked them to warm it up, and for about 20 minutes it was fine, then the temperature dipped again."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and it's never been a good experience. Food is blah and the service is not great. It's just one of those restaurants that don't have anything special, it's just there."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience, the manager was extremely rude when we asked for credit back on New Belgium Winter beer when we are in June! This is un acceptable and I'll never go to a Fox and Hound again. We ordered a New Belgium beer in June that turned out to be a winter beer and was 4 mounts past the beers expiration date. We didn't drink the beer because it tasted so horrible, but the manager Chris Davis still would not give us a credit and called us \"rude\" for asking for a credit on old beer that tasted horrible and was expired. This is ridiculous and I will never go to Fox and Hound because of our experience with Chris Davis."}
{"text":"A live sports bar at night. Stopped in to watch a basketball game (UK v. ND). Very live sports bar atmosphere with a crowd that came to cheer. Despite there being several open and clean tables, there was a 15 minute wait. I assumed there weren't enough waitresses, but 15 minutes later, we were seated at one of those same tables. We only ordered appetizers, I having the bacon cheese fries and spinach artichoke dip. My fries were good and the cheese was melted and stringy. The dip was cool, so I asked if it could be heated. The waitress obliged, but they probably spit in it. I'll never know. Overall, not a bad experience. Come here for sports and drinks, not food."}
{"text":"Great food and location but the service could use some improvements. The servers are nice but don't come by very often to see if you need anything. After being seated it takes a long time for someone to come and wait on you, even when it's not busy. If the service could be improved, I think this restaurant would be even better."}
{"text":"Tried twice. Might try a third, which would be once every two years. If it doesn't impress this time, I'm giving up on it."}
{"text":"Been here a few times over the past few years as we visit. The people leaving negative reviews must be people who can never be satisfied or have unreasonable expectations.  Staff is always kind, service is good and food is decent."}
{"text":"If your young and live in the Ballantyne/Pineville area this is a great spot! I reccomend Sunday Funday (a collaboration of karaoke/beer pong/pool/darts and great drink specials).  The staff is why I come back! (Jillian/Melissa/Lindsay/ Colleen and many more) The staff is friendly and personable.  It's honestly the Cheers bar of Charlotte. Super laid back and safe!"}
{"text":"I have visited this Fox & Hound many times in the last three years, but I have not taken the time to write a review.  I've always thought Fox & Hound was a little pricey for what you get, but it's still a nice bar.  If you want to grab a good draft beer, play darts, and catch a game all at once, this is a great place to do it.  Today, I stopped in with a group of co-workers to formally say goodbye to our summer intern.  We each ordered meals from the lunch menu while we play pool and chatted over root beer.  Soon, our meals began arriving one by one delivered by friendly waitresses.  We were pretty much the only patrons in the bar, so we were given a lot of attention.  I ordered the lunch portion of chicken tacos.  Upon arrival, the tacos looked small and malnourished.  I was hoping for a little more toppings to make them appear larger, but the taste and texture was still good.  I also ordered sweet potato fries, which were cut too thin to enjoy the great flavor that is deep fried sweet potatoes.  All in all, the meal was okay, but nothing great.  The price was great at $7!  This venue is very good.  There's lots to do here and its good for large groups."}
{"text":"Was there on a Saturday.  Waitress was Leann - she started great, then faded.  Wife ordered a burger (no problems).  I ordered a cup of chili & 10 med wings, lightly sauced.  Chili not delivered first.  Wings had no sauce!  I don't like them dripping in sauce, but I do want sauce.  Leann was terrible refilling drinks.  Temperature was extremely cold for August.  Would probably not return."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service and experience I have ever had in 53 years of eating at restaurants across the nation and the world! Do not attend this restaurant!! We set 15 minutes before being able to order. Our food was brought out one meal at a time taking approximately another 25 minutes there were five of us I receive my food five minutes later I got my tater tot's two minutes later my mother got her food. Four minutes later my sister-in-law got her salad. Three minutes later my father got his sandwich. My brother salad arrived 10 minutes later we had to get most of it to go as we were attending a movie which we already had tickets for. We arrived at this restaurant over an hour before the movie and we're still late there were only three other patrons in the restaurant. Again stay away from this place!!! Management did nothing repeat nothing not even apologize! Stay away again stay away again stay away!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to watch NFL games on Sunday!! The food was always good and the Service was great!! Somewhere along the line, service became an after thought. They always seem to be short handed and theservers who are working are not that friendly.  My last 2 visits have actually caused me to not want to visit any longer. Waiting over an hr to get food is unacceptable. (When it's not that crowded) At least come by and refill my iced tea and say \"Oh the kitchen is behind a little\". Did I mention that my Burger was cold?"}
{"text":"Do not waste your time or money here. The reviews have a history of more bad than good experiences. We had terrible food, service and watered down G&T's.  I only wished I would have read the reviews before going.  Never again."}
{"text":"This is such a wonderful experience. Jeremy and Rick are the local feel and so welcoming. The entire staff is fun and the service is great. Home!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time last night around 10 pm. Went out to have a few drinks after thanksgiving and get a couple snacks. We had buffalo chix and southwestern chix pub rolls, and let me tell you they were AWESOME. Had a few beers and lemon drop shot, which were yummy. Our server was good, couldve been a tad more attentive, but overall had a good experience. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service is slow. Waited 45 mins on a takeout order for wings when there was only maybe 20 other people in the restaurant who were sitting at the bar. Saw numerous servers leave several times out the back door to smoke cigarettes instead of tending to customers. The server informed me that the reason my order took so long is because they forgot to put my order in when I called, and didn't inform me of the issue until I had already been waiting for an additional 30 mins on top of the 25 that they had estimated after I called in. If you are wondering why your tips are struggling and you can hardly maintain 400$ a week at your job, you should probably take into consideration the value of work ethic and pride you put into your job. The reason that no one takes you seriously is because you can hardly take yourself seriously and complete the simple task at hand."}
{"text":"Cool vibe. I used to come here for trivia, but my team broke up and that was that.  Food wise, haha...don't kid yourself! You only eat here to burn off the booze! The drinks are decent, but i'd have to take another person's word since I don't partake of the spirits."}
{"text":"Bailey's is now Fox and Hound. Don't expect much of a change. The bathrooms are still disgusting. The interior was updated and looks a little cleaner but it's nothing special. The drinks are so weak it's appalling.  Here's why I am really unimpressed... came here on a Friday night for a friend's birthday.  Arrived slightly before 10pm. It wasn't overly crowded, but it wasn't dead either. At exactly 10pm the lights above our table turned off. That was different. Dealt with it .... and then the DJ appeared.  This dude was BLASTING what I would describe as club music.  The bass vibrated my unmentionable areas.  I had to scream to someone a foot away from me to be heard.  Bro, it's PINEVILLE not uptown Charlotte.  If I wanted to have music vibrate my insides I'd haul myself to an actual club. What made it especially awkward - NO ONE was breaking it down. A few head bobs, the occasional arm wave,  but no one seemed to enjoy it.  One woman actually plugged her ears and looked like she wanted to die.  Seriously,  lose the thumping music and remember what you are, a low key bar/restaurant with pool tables.  Don't try to pretend you're something else. Plus side,  our waitress  (Kim) was pretty awesome."}
{"text":"I really like the Fox and the Hound. It's a great casual American restaurant in the heard (literally, in the center) of Birkdale Village. They have outdoor seating as well. They have great beer specials, and can make almost anything you can order. Their food is quite good for American- bar-type food. Great burgers, wings, appetizers, pasta... And if you're a sport's fan, this is a perfect place to watch sports and kick back with a beer!"}
{"text":"Went here for St. Patrick's Day.  I had business in Charlotte and frequented the Fox & Hound at least six times.  If you're in the mood for a fantastic steak.  This is the place.  Friendly staff and the manager is very attentive to his customers, the establishment and the service.  This tops my A-list of places to go in Charlotte..."}
{"text":"I have been here a few different times. The time or two that I have had food it has been pretty good. The times I have drinks they have been pretty good. It seems to be hit or miss as far as crowds. The times I have come the crow has always be medium size. The staff is average and the music you never know. I like it when they have a live band however I have not figured out what days the live band is there. Will I return yes."}
{"text":"Last time I'll visit F&H.  Never been overly impressed but tonight was the worst. Bartender never smiled, slow with beer order, and didn't notice my glass was empty while her friend at the bar managed to get 3 entrees while we waited for our appetizer (free offer thru Yelp - brussel sprouts). When they finally arrived, they were cold. Within ten minutes, the cold ones were replaced with another order of cold brussel sprouts. Never mind our entree was nowhere in sight.  I realize the bartender can't control the kitchen but all we got from her was that she was \"frustrated with the kitchen\". That made three of us. At this point, I had finished my second beer and was done with trying to have a decent meal. The bright side - I saved $12.50 on an overpriced salad."}
{"text":"I live in Birkdale Village, so it's hard for me NOT to stop by the Fox and Hound for a drink every now and then.   The service is off and on. I've had really great servers, but I've also sat at a table and had no one wait on me for 15 minutes. All depends on the day, I suppose.  I come here mostly to watch the UFC fights. They have a private room in the back where you pay $5 to watch the pay per view fights. It's a pretty good deal, and you get a good group of UFC fans together!  Also, I'm a Pittsburgh girl and this bar is a Pittsburgh bar! (You can see plenty of Steelers swag in the back room!)"}
{"text":"I love Fox and Hound! They have music bingo on Tuesdays, it was so fun and we won gift cards. You will have a great beer and yummy food:)"}
{"text":"Fun place to hangout Sunday night. Pool, beer pong tables, karaoke and nice bar."}
{"text":"Surprised to be seated immediately on a Saturday evening! Our waitress was warm and friendly and very nice to our boys which always means you win with me.  I was torn between a burger and wings and ended up choosing wings. Wonderful choice. I typically like hot and sweet so I went with hot honey and Thai chilli. The Thai chilli was WONDERFUL. Hot honey was also good but next time I will get my whole order of Thai chilli. I did add a side of tater tots that were cooked to perfection.   Hubby ordered a burger. Didn't get to taste it but it did look good and his plate was left empty.  We will definitely be back. And they're having a fundraiser for a worthy charity so we might support that!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night for the playoff game with the boyfriend. I really enjoyed myself. It has an at home vibe.   Service was great. Our server brought out the food quickly, grabbed beers quickly, and was really personable. It was busy the other night so I have to give the server thumbs up for managing the craziness.   They had a ton of drink specials. We just stuck with NoDa beers on tap. The beers were cold, delicious, and reasonably priced.  We didn't order any entrees. We went with the mozzarella sticks and the chicken quesadilla appetizers. The mozzarella sticks were great. The chicken quesadilla was one of the best I've had. I would come back just for that quesadilla. It's pulled chicken and not chunks of chicken which completely changed the flavor profile.   Overall, this is a great place to venture out to if you just want relax with good company."}
{"text":"Run-of-the-mill sports bar complete with plenty of beer on tap, lotsa TVs, and pub style food.  It's located in the strip mall with the Harris Teeter, which offers patrons a bunch of alternatives to wander off too before or after the visit.  They do have some drink specials which are utilized by plenty of folks who work around the location, so there is usually a manageable sized crowd.  The BBQ flat bread pizza I had was tasty, actually, I would order it again.  The atmosphere is okay, pretty generic really.  The problem I have, and the reason for the low rated review, was with the service.  The gal who waited on me was visably sick.  I mean, c'mon management.  If one of your staff, who is GOING TO HANDLE FOOD, is obviously, visably, noticeably sick - SEND THEM HOME.  Long story short, I got sick the next day, same symptoms as the waiter who served us.  Completely unacceptable.    Too bad really, because the food was decent for what it was, but I can't justify the experience now that I have to deal with this illness."}
{"text":"So we went to fox and hound last night and it was awful. When they sat us down my waitress asked everyone what they wanted to drink but me. When I finally told her it took her 25 minutes to bring it to me because she said she forgot. Next the people that I was with ordered fish and chips, 15 minutes later they come back saying they do not have any fish and chips. So me and a friend ordered a burger. When it finally came the fries were old and cold. So I sent the fries back and my friend sent back the whole meal because it was cold. 15 minutes later they bring me some hot fries and bring my friend the same fries from earlier. He asked for the manager and when he came the manger just the food doesn't get any hotter than what it was. I will never come back here and I suggest that no one does."}
{"text":"Not a very healthy menu - I struggled to find good options. I ended up getting the Napa Valley Spinach Salad which I have had before and was very good - it has chicken in it. I also ordered the Chicken Sandwich sans bun and got a side of broccoli (which as healthy as that sounds wasn't as they were swimming in what I'm guessing was butter). It is a cool place to hang out tho. Lots of bar and high top seating. Good seating for groups. Lots of TVs and separate rooms to eat in, one of which has pool tables."}
{"text":"Honestly the service is a hit and miss and when it misses the only thing you can do is getup a leave. I stop going to F&H because if the slow and terriable service for two years. Well nothing  has changed.  All I wanted was a drink and all the Bartender wanted to do was play on her phone. I had to walk out after waiting 10 mins. They havr no respect for uour time or money!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to go for beers and hanging out, but time and age have not been kind to the place.  The interior looks like a dive bar, but the location and prices say it should be a upscale tavern.  It's dark, dirty, and old.  You shouldn't bother with food here, it's not that good.  Servers are ok, and bartenders are fine, but they still try to charge for pool, but the tables are garbage now and the place was dead on a Friday night.    It's sad to see a former local bar fade to a status below Hickory tavern, and that might be the worse thing I say about Fox & Hound"}
{"text":"Went to the Fox & Hound a couple times this weekend, visiting my buddy who lives in the area. I am familiar with Bailey's, a related chain but have never been to a Fox & Hound.   During the weekend, we went here twice. Even during a Cav's game, the service was great, and it is a great, clean and fun atmosphere. They even offer billiards and other games, and a ton of seating.   During both of the visits here, we got great service, and even got a free cheeseburger. Beer selection is up to par, and so is the desert. Had their new S'Mores desert, and it was also great. If you're in the area and looking for a place with a great selection of food and beer, with great service from waiters and managers, check this place out."}
{"text":"A hungry stomach led us to the restaurant.  Fortunately, on Christmas Eve after the Panthers game, the place was not crowded with a few tables occupied and folks sitting at the bar.  We sat down, ordered drinks, appetizers, and food.  Our waitress was well informed and prompt in checking in on us.  I ordered the chicken tacos. There were three adequately proportioned tacos with cheddar and Monterey jack cheese (not too much) and pico de gallo, served with chips and salsa.  I thought this was a pretty good meal for $10.  For dessert, we shared a S'Mores Parfait.  Even though it was dark, the parfait had far too much chocolate but I enjoyed it. I had no idea the restaurant was at Northlake and am glad we stumbled upon it.  They had 18+ television monitors - I found it a bit difficult to maintain focus on one game.  However, I look forward to another visit."}
{"text":"Cool place. Nice for playing pool. Good for weekends spot.  They have this special discounts for weekdays too, They have one of the great chicken wings grill I ever had."}
{"text":"Went to Fox & Hound on Friday night for Paint Nite, a canvas-painting class that travels to different locations around Charlotte. There was plenty of parking, so I had no trouble getting parked and inside. When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by a staff member who directed me to the area where Paint Nite was set up. This was great!  The restaurant itself is huge, but the bar area is pretty small. Once I got situated for Paint Nite, I went to the bar to order a drink and it was a solid 7 minutes before anyone was able to help up. The designated Paint Nite server approached us and took our drink order so we could take our seats and start painting. I appreciated that. But it was about 20 minutes until we got our drinks, and they actually lost my drink order so I had to reorder and wait another 10 minutes for my beverage.   When I did get my strawberry watermelon margarita (that was only $6, BTW), it was delicious and refreshing and not too sweet (thumbs up). They were much more efficient with bringing our checks and closing our tabs. I did not try any of the food, but it looked and smelled really good."}
{"text":"Had lunch here again today.  I think I've been over a hundred times in the last few years and I've never written a review.  Probably because it is never anything stupendous.  Just a good solid lunch spot near my office.  Sandwiches are all pretty good, service very good too.  Very solid beer list although I never partake at lunch.  So if you're around Northlake mall and need a beer and a bite, this is a very safe bet."}
{"text":"I've made it my mission in life to go to every restaurant in Birkdale Village, though I have to say that going to a pub/grille is not always something I look forward to. I needed a little extra motivation, and a Groupon was the thing that pushed me over the edge. We visited Fox and Hound on a rainy Friday night and while it's not a timeless classic like the Disney film of similar name, it was slightly better than I expected.  We took a seat on their outdoor covered patio so we were able to enjoy the slightly cooler weather even though it was rainy. They had some surprisingly decent rock songs playing in the background, and that's always a plus. The service was kind of slow, in terms of our booze and appetizers coming out, but the waitress was ever-present...almost to the point where she checked on us too much. Still, I'll take a server that comes around too many times as opposed to not often enough any day of the week.  I was instantly drawn to their tall $4 Sam Adams draft special. Having been born and raised in the north east, there will always be a place in my heart for Sams, and when I saw Fox and Hound offered a Sams hard cider I just had to give it a whirl. It was pretty sweet, light and tasty, just like other hard ciders. I wouldn't drink it again, since I prefer beer to hard cider, but it was nice to get to try it.  We went with the \"Chicken Billard Sticks\" as an appetizer. It wasn't on the menu but was the special of the night, and since it came with six sticks for $5 we were sold. A better name for them would be \"Southwest Chicken Eggroll\" because that's exactly what they were, and that's not a bad thing. These eggrolls were stuffed with chicken, cheese, corn, peppers and beans and served alongside some kind of creamy dressing/sauce. It definitely made for a tasty, and affordable, appetizer.  For dinner I got the 1/2 rack of ribs, and they were just what I was expecting. These aren't you're southern BBQ ribs but more steakhouse ribs, like something you would get at Chilis. They weren't too meaty but the meat was super tender and came right off the bone. The sauce was a bit sweet for my taste, but the quality of the rib itself is what I would expect at a higher end chain restaurant, so it's better than it could have been.  The miss' ordered the basil pesto chicken pizza and that was tasty as well. While not as crispy or tastetacular as Brixx pizza across the way is, Fox and Hound's flat bread pizzas are not only a decent quality (for a chain pub) but also a decent quality. While it was a big soft and doughy as opposed to crispy, the pesto, chicken, mushrooms and feta all played nicely together as far as flavor goes. She only finished half of it, so there are plenty of leftovers for all!  Fox and Hound barely surpassed my expectations. I expected a bland chain restaurant meal but instead got served a decent chain restaurant meal. There are better places in the area to get booze, crispy pizza and BBQ ribs, but I wouldn't be opposed to returning."}
{"text":"It sadden's me to bump my 5 star review down today, we are frequent customers of Fox and Hound as my bf loves to come here for Thursday poker nights. The food is good and the drinks are priced ok for a place like this. What really brings my update down is the service.. or lack there of. We've been coming here for months now I'd say and its always the same story (excluding the first experience I wrote about). I sit down to do some work and have a beer while the bf goes for the poker tables. It takes MORE THAN 30 MINUTES for someone to even acknowledge my existence! Simultaneously, there are about 3-4 servers weaving around my table to help their other customers. Is it a crime to come in as a single customer?... I'm ordering drinks and food here for myself and my bf people. Cmon...    Today, I finally got sick of this recurring treatment and called the manager out. She understood and was apologetic about it, which was nice. She sent out a server right away who kind of joked it off like.. I'm not sure what happened here. But, there server put my order in right away and everything came out in a prompt manner following the confrontation. They put forward awesome service afterwards but, its not cool if it comes after all this trouble.   I hope this is a wake up call for Fox and Hound. Maybe have a meeting to enforce seating arrangements between servers or something.. The ball can't be dropped this many times. We will be returning for Poker nights but, I hope the service improves after this. I hate to be the Negative Nancy here, I really do."}
{"text":"I will NEVER come back to eat here. This place should just be a bar and not serve food. Which the food was bad. The service was just as bad. I sat at the bar. I watch One bartender sit at the register and text on her phone which was sitting at the register then another bartender dance and singing really loud and calling customers that she was friendly with all types of different nicknames.  The Bartender who took my order basically pointed at me and said what do you want gave and I gave her my order never check if it was good I think I ate 2 pieces out of the whole entire order and she looks at me say so you're done your bill is such such amount never even gave me a receipt or check to show that amount until after I paid. Super unprofessional...."}
{"text":"This is my third time eating here and I'm just... Meh. It's good food but nothing special and the service is always just okay. Today, I was clearly still eating my fries and the waitress just took my plate! She wasn't rude but just very absent minded and didn't pay attention to what we were saying. It's a good sports bar but just bland overall, nothing special."}
{"text":"11 o'clock on a Friday night and the place is hoppin'. Music is loud. Lots of talking.  Sports games are on the big screens. Looks like people are meeting up. Not much food coming out, as I don't see any waitresses at the moment. Holiday parties have broken up. Seems to be a good neighborhood type bar. Fun meet-up spot. Been here many times for dinner. Good food. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite local gastropubs to hit up... food has been consistently good (chili cheese fries!) and the beer selection is enjoyable too.  We had a great conversation with one of the managers during a visit and he was clearly a huge fan of beer, which shows in how well the place is run.  Service has been good and there are plenty of TVs for catching multiple games/sports at once."}
{"text":"I was here waiting for a friend to pick me up after work since I was traveling in the area.  I was here on Tuesday June 16th around 3:30pm.  I walked in to a bar the had some of Ballantyne's finest here if you know what I mean.  I sat at the bar and the server took my drink order and asked if I wanted food.  I let him know that I was all set.  A few minutes later he asks me again.  No big deal.  Shortly after that again he ask me. I was like what the F??  I didn't know if he was trying to pad my check.  But I already ordered my second drink so it wasn't like I was just sitting at the bar not ordering anything.  What really upset me was that I went to play Golden Tee(IO had to kill an hour and a half).  I tried to get another drink.  He just walked by me 5 or 6 times and ignored me.  THEN...serves the two people on each side of me and continue to walks by again.  It might have been the rudest person I have ever dealt with at a bar.  On the good side of things.  The bar is a nice set up.  A lot of tv's.  Good set up of table.  They also have pool tables.  But that is it."}
{"text":"Been a while since my last Fox & Hound experience so I was pretty stoked for trying the new location (to me) at Northlake.  It is a bit of a haul for me but peer pressure prevailed and I ended up having a decent time here.  Our server, Meghan was super nice and friendly.  It did get a bit busy with the Panthers game on a Thursday night - also simultaneous trivia on the same night made for an interesting time.  We didn't stay for trivia but I would have been a little peeved since the game sound was interrupted by the shrill, way-to-excited voice of the woman who runs trivia.  Atmosphere is similar to a lot of the other Fox & Hound locations in Charlotte:  dim with tvs all over the place.  The tables in here are very small!  The 4 top we were sitting at was totally full once all of us ordered drinks.   Then the food came out and it was a shuffling, puzzle match as far as finding places to set things.  It worked out though.  Fish & Chips came out for me with 3 huge, honking pieces of beer battered/fried goodness that a proceeded to scarf down like I had never eaten fish & chips before.  It was nice and crispy.  The fries that came with it were okay - slaw on the side wasn't really anything to write home about.  I'd say this is a solid hangout place if you live in the area.  Unfortunately for me, I had a nice lonely 40min drive home to Matthews, but I can see myself doing it occassionally."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service. DISGUSTING food. I went here to try out a new spot in Birkdale and it was the worst dining experience I have went through. I ordered a burger and there was a long hair in it. I tried to tell a staff member and he was annoyed to have to deal with the situation. They were extremely rude about it and not accommodating about it. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service. DISGUSTING food. I have never in my life met a more rude staff. I found a hair in my burger and when I reported it they were completely annoyed at having to deal with the situation and in no way tried to accommodate me for it. It was hard enough to get a refund. Not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"Got carded twice here... since I was an out of towner, they wanted to really make sure I wasn't sporting a fake ID... I guess the receding hairline wasn't enough to prove that I was over 21!  SHOCK TOP... TALL please... times 2!!! Unfortunately the service here was too slow for me... and on a Monday night when nobody else was around I thought to myself, what is this place like when it's packed to the brim on a Thursday/Friday?  I did enjoy the fact that music videos were playing on the big screen and the music was routed skillfully through the loud speakers.  Actually made me reminisce about the days when MTV did have music videos and not just Teen Mom and Jersey Shore.  As far as the food went, I had the Chicken Wrap which was tasty, nothing special and at times I had to make sure I had enough salsa on there to offset any potential blandness.  The ingredients sometimes reminded me that the whole burrito was processed vs. fresh.  On this night, the food could have been whatevers because I wasn't there to eat, I was there to relax after a long day of travel--I wanted to drink!  Again, it's hard to stay relaxed and maintain a good buzz when it takes the waitress 10-15 minutes to process a round of beers (again, the restaurant and bar were at a 10% capacity).  I've been here before on prior visits to Ohio and I feel that there's so much potential for a place like this to succeed--decor, ambiance, beer selection and pool tables.  HOWEVER, until the service improves, the Fox & Hound is begging for the opportunity to disappoint you."}
{"text":"This place has been our go to bar hangout area for a few years. Bar area is setup nice with the long tables, lots of seating, good number of TVs, and great local and premium beers available. Likewise specialty cocktails if beer isn't your thing.  Contrary to the bad food reviews, of the two dozen or so times we've been here, our food has actually been good to very good.   For appetizers, we almost always get the buffalo chicken pub rolls. I've had the pizzas, fish & chicken tacos multiple times, and have been satisfied. On our stop last night, I had the chicken quesadilla. Great flavor with a good amount of chicken, cheese, and sides of sour cream and guacamole for dipping.   One person in our party ordered the California Club. It's not your usual looking club sandwich - looked more like a grilled chicken sandwich. The chicken was pretty tough, and chewy. Our waitress gladly took it off the bill. Again maybe I'm just getting lucky on the food! But no complaints from me.  Service here has always been good each and every time we've been. Polite and friendly servers no matter how busy they've been.   Still a fan until they show me otherwise."}
{"text":"I was here for drinks.  Bartenders were great waitress was never at our table. I think she was more into socializing. Lots of screens to watch games . The atmosphere was friendly and fun. The game we wanted wasn't available here, so you may want to call ahead to see if they have the game on. Appetizers were pretty basic. Menu is bar style food."}
{"text":"There are many places to watch a game, so many choices in a town this size.  I give this place high marks for the number of HDTV's, the quality and selection of food and the professional staff and one of the most important, flexibility of seating for large groups, this place scores on all accounts.  I was there to see the Panthers whip up on the 49'ers! Lot's of fans wearing their game day colors.  Emily was nice, pleasent & professional and took good care of us. They also have daily drink specials and daily $4 Blue Moon's."}
{"text":"You know how the food trucks around town are working to rally support, get signers on petitions, etc. to change the local laws governing their business?  I would love to do the same thing for Fox and Hound only the rallying of support would be to shut the place down and bring in something with decent food and service in this price range.  It's just great reading reviews from 2010 giving the place comments and talking about how the food has gone downhill and yet here we are in almost June of 2011and really nothing has changed.  And, when your food goes downhill from a starting point of yuck, that's a really bad thing.  Birkdale Village deserves better but, because their bar business seems to thrive on weekend nights and there are enough people up here willing to accept and even support mediocrity, the doors are still open."}
