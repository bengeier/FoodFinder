{"text":"Eaten here a bunch. Good food friendly staff, the only complaint I have is it is a little pricey for what you get. 10 dollars for a club sandwich fries and a tea isn't what I'd call a bargain, however it's not ridiculous either. Overall good place with standard diner fare."}
{"text":"Cheap, whole in the wall place.  Food was ok.  Not worth returning to.  It's good for all the businesses around that area in what appears to be food desert.  I just wouldn't go out of your way to go there.  

The restaurant was clean and the people were nice."}
{"text":"That was one of the BEST Rueben sandwiches ever!!! Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu!! Everything smells so good.  #comfortfood #charlottesgem"}
{"text":"Tried the Wednesday spaghetti special. Disappointed. Came with a brown meat sauce, almost no flavor. Needs a tomato based sauce with seasoning."}
{"text":"The Cobb Salad was a disappointment.  The blue cheese crumbles were NOT fresh and had that funky-cheese taste that indicated it needed to be tossed out rather than tossed into a salad!   There were only 3 or 4 paper thin slices of avocado, and some the lettuce was what you would get when you're at the core of the lettuce head. The bacon and egg were pretty decent.  But for 7.95?  It's not worth it to me.  
Amazingly, I had this same salad about a year and a half year ago....and it seemed to have a WHOLE lot more to it - tomatoes and such.  I ordered this particular salad as a takeout order, and went on my recollection of the cobb salad that I had previously.  I don't foresee ever returning there for anything else."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch and left pretty disappointed. 

It was my first visit so I was pleased to see the daily specials and variety in their options. I went with the turkey burger and fries. Meh. The burger was white meat, which I'm not a fan of and was very greasy. I didn't finish it and that's very unusual for me. The fries are crinkle cut and could have been sent out from the kitchen hotter. 

So it's a 2 star joint for me. I'll pass on a return visit."}
{"text":"I work just across the street from here and my co-workers and I go here constantly. As others have said, there really isn't much in this area. It's a small diner with a basic home-cooking type menu. Burgers, sandwiches, salads, meatloaf, fish, hamburger steak, etc. They also serve breakfast in the morning.

CCC really hits the spot when you're starving and only have 30 minutes to grab lunch and get back to work. They also do call-in/pickup ordering which is easy. The ladies working behind the counter and the owner are all extremely nice people and quickly start to recognize you as a regular once you've been there 3-4 times."}
{"text":"This is a local place with a lot of variety. Breakfast, burgers,  soups, salads, hot plates and daily specials. Order at the counter and wait for your number to be called.

This place is packed at lunch time. It took us a while to find a table. I ordered a veggie plate with a side salad, black-eyed peas, collards, Mac and cheese and it came with a corn muffin. 

Service was great. The manager came around to make sure we got everything and when we were leaving, they took care of clearing the table. 

I wish the food was better. I enjoyed the black-eyed peas the most. Seasoned well and slightly firm. The corn muffin was outstanding, moist and had pieces of corn inside with the right amount of sweetness. Salad was small and basic. The Italian dressing had no flavor. The macoroni in the Mac and cheese was overcooked. Collards were bland. 

I bumped up the rating for the service, but the food was just okay."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy...just good, filling diner food.  Recommended for lunch.  The fish plate is a good bet."}
{"text":"I see this place when I look out my office window. That and a mound of grass. Coffey Creek Cafe is a much needed lunch establishment in this office park area. The food is greasy and filling, but nothing to get really excited about. My typical order is a fish sandwich, which is pretty much the only thing I can get here, but it does the job. It's bland, but nothing a bit of condiment lovin' can't take care of. 

Place is clean and more modern looking than the name suggests. Plus you get a punch card that gets you $5 off after 10 meals. 

(Interesting note: the building across the driveway has a solar PV installation on top of the building that you can see as you're taking off from CLT airport!)"}
{"text":"My daily lunch spot for month. Tried all their salads and I still love it. Nice services and the cash ladies are so nice."}
{"text":"Staff is really nice. I got the fish sandwich when I went which was good to me. Lots of options. Fast service"}
{"text":"We went for brunch and the food was just ok. I had a pimento grilled cheese and I've had better. Fries were average. People were super nice but overall it was nothing special."}
