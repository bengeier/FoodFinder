{"text":"Markham had been sorely lacking quality Indian food for a while. No more! Ambiyan has all of your Indian favourites, from Chana Masala and Aloo Gobi to Dal Makhani and Saag Paneer (can you tell I'm vegatarian?). Those who have gone with me have also raved about some of the more carnivorous dishes.   Atmosphere is great, but depends on what you are looking for. Inside is quiet dining, while in the summers the patio is great to people gaze and catch up with friends. The only caveat I will add is that it is close to a 4-way stop so there's some street noise, but if you are that uptight you have other problems."}
{"text":"This place is great! The environment had my favourite triple-c's: clean, calm and charming. Our waiter was with us instantly, getting our drinks and water within a few minutes of us sitting down.  All four in our party ordered on the fixed price menu. It was really worth it! I got the chicken samosa. It was pretty large, warm, crispy and slightly spicy. The sauces that accompanied the dish were incredible.   I got the chicken vindaloo. I gotta say, it wasn't as spicy as other places I've had. The dish came with basmati rice infused with saffron. My favourite part of the rice was the hidden little crunch onion pieces. I got the butter naan bread on the side. It was all really good, and I have enough for leftovers the next day.  This place would be really cute if you are the type to share! My friends and I sometimes turn into hungry monsters and don't even consider (I am the guiltiest of them all)!!!  This is a short and sweet review, but the place kinda speaks for itself! I'd go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic indian food.  very aromatic and flavourful.  I like how the foods were served on silver stainless steel plates and bowls, felt formal and respectful.  large servings, had leftovers for take out.  Service was good."}
{"text":"We ordered from Ambiyan for a party at our place. The owner was wonderful to deal with. We ordered a bunch of dishes - the chicken vindaloo was great! They even threw in the raita and exttra naans and gulab jamuns! Overall experience was awesome.. everyone loved the food and we would definitely order food from these guys again!"}
{"text":"This is the best indian restaurant i've been to. And I've frequented very many  indian places but the service, atmosphere, location and food puts this one at the very top. The staff is NICE and makes good recommendations, there on top of everything, including filling up your water glass cause the food can get spicy. I've had pretty much everything on the menu and apart from a few things, I liked it all. All the chicken dishes are yum (chicken korma, and tikka masala) and im not a huge fan of beef but they have some good ones.  All the apps are absolutely delicious. I recommend this place wholeheartedly."}
{"text":"Best Indian food ever. Upscale and priced thusly but it blows your average Indian takeout out of the water.  Will update with a more detailed review!"}
{"text":"We thought that it was a village pub with wings and the usual pub fare when we walked in. But wow were we surprised with an amazing Indian meal - saag paneer, chicken vindaloo and butter chicken and garlic paan bread. It was awesome! I would highly recommend this restaurant. And we will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Indian cuisine, great service and great atmosphere. We sat on the porch and it was very romantic :)"}
{"text":"I'm Indian but i don't like at home and nor do i cook Indian so i was really craving Indian food.  Since my partner in crime and myself were headed to Unionville Street Festival, we decided to check out Ambiyan based on good yelp reviews.  After walking around for a few hours, we were exhausted and hungry, which in turn makes me hangry.  We were greeted by the hostess and she was amazing at catering towards our needs as we requested to be seated by a tv so we can catch the end of game 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals.    Downhill after that...  We both ordered from the prefix menu as we felt this was a better buy.  For apps we had Chicken Pakora and Chicken Samosa.  The shell on the samosa was too hard & Pakora was too bland for a indian joint.  My girlfriend thought she was eating chicken fingers, wow.  For the main we had the Chicken Korma and Lamb with Garlic Naan.  After the apps it took almost 30 mins for the food to come out, mind you this is closing time and they are not busy.  While waiting on our food we even witnessed two staff members in a disagreement (real professional).  When the food finally came, it would've been nice to have heard a \"sorry for the wait\"  or something to acknowledge our long wait but noting.  At this point i have already decided I'm never coming back to this restaurant plus i have a really bad expectation for the main that is about to get man handled because i hangry :)  To my surprise, the food was actually really good and flavourful and thats why i still gave them one star.  Everything else was disappointing and never will i go back.    When the bill the waiter mentioned \"you guys came on our busiest day of the year\", my reply \" i guess thats why the service was so slow\".  After that you'd expect anything except am awkward silence... now i think back at it and it was pretty funny.  They also had an extra charge on the bill because instead of the regular Naan i opted for the Garlic Naan.  I did make that request so i have no problem paying it, just wish it was communicated to me at time of ordering instead of them being slick and adding it onto my bill without explanation.  Again i have no problem with the charge, my problem is with the principal behind it.  There is actually noting wrong with saying \"theres an extra charge associated with substituting that\", instead of trying to be slick and me feel like you're shoving extra charges down my throat....Fraud :("}
{"text":"I love Ambiyan. The mango lassi is yummy and everything I have ever tried has been delish! My fav side is garlic naan... but you probably shouldn't order this on a first date.  My husband isn't so fortunate.. hah! So we always garlic-it up!  Portions aren't large, but we always leave full.   I also tote along a 4 year old and a 1 year old."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with my girlfriends. One of them was there before and she really loved it. I was eager to try good Indian food. Before I only tried it cooked by other people in their homes, but had very bad experiences with other restaurants.  This place is delicious. And the best thing is that they can make it non spicy and truly mild. Naan and samosas are the best. For lunch we had pre fixed menu for $18. It was a great deal. Very lovely patio and super friendly waitress. The best Indian food experience so far."}
{"text":"4.5 - I've never thought I'd find such an authentic yet classy and modern Indian restaurant in upper Markham, especially in Unionville. The service was perfect and quick, our server was so attentive and the food came quickly and fresh, despite it being one hour before closing. The atmosphere is spacious with a beautiful patio, open doors which really brought in the summer night breeze.  We ordered the chicken pakoras and it was amazing. They came with mini chips and a zesty/tart sauce. The chunky chicken pieces were deep fried but not oily at all. There was no grounded meat and with the sauce, it left me feeling full but not greasy.  The lamb biryani was seasoned a bit on the lighter side, but we had it with butter chicken so it was perfect. The lamb pieces were huge and well cooked they came apart in your mouth. The additional peppers, cucumber, and lemon slice helped lighten our dish. The portion is a regular size, I think great for 1-2 people depending on how much you eat.  The best would have to be the butter chicken. It came in a silver dish with yoghurt sauce on the side. The butter chicken was tender, meaty, and light compared to the sauce. The sauce was very zesty, you could taste the tomato immediately, it wasn't buttery or overly salty - the tomato was truly a great touch. The yoghurt sauce had a mixture of diced tomatoes, pomegranate (which was surprisingly pleasant addition), and herbs. It mixed well with the butter chicken and helped keep the dish from being overwhelming heavy.  I would definitely come back here when I'm craving butter chicken in the future!"}
{"text":"The food is good and it's nice that it's on Main Street. However, unfortunately the food took forever to come out. We waited for the appetizers for half an hour and the mains took another hour. The time for food to be placed on the table is unacceptable.  The kitchen needs to be a bit more efficient."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the heart of Historic Main Street Unionville lies one of Markham's best kept secrets- Ambiyan! Went here October 11th with the family: We ordered the Hummus appetizer, butter chicken, naan, basmati rice, saag paneer, chickpeas! Food was incredible, super clean, service was what you would expect at some fancy place in Yorkville, and the price was very reasonable! Also, if you like your Indian food spicy (like I do) you'll need to request it (I recommend spicy butter chicken with Garlic Naan)! Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"I ordered the butter chicken with naan, chicken samosas, fish and crab tiki, and a mango lassi. The serving sizes could have been bigger for the price I was paying. The butter chicken was really sweet and not so spicy which I didn't really like. The naan was too thin and crispy. The chicken samosas were average. The fish and crab tiki was nothing special. The mango lassi was too tart and not enough mango flavor. Your paying for the atmosphere it's a cute place. But not really the most authentic Indian food."}
{"text":"The check does come quick. The food takes awhile, a little too long. The food, well if you are expecting authenticity, not here, you get a nice some what Indian meal. To be clear, the food is not bad, just not real Indian. It's  all about location."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER! It took 20 mins to be seated. The server never came to get our order.  We had to call a server and he didnt know anything about the restaurant promo. We asked for water. We waited for more than half hour and the server never came back with the water or to ask for our order. Will never return to this restaurant. Their service is crap."}
{"text":"Went: 6:00 pm Sat Mar 21 2015 Ordered: will have to look up Cost: incl. tax and tip $35-40 Comments: I am reviewing restaurants that I've been into in the last 3 months, but I'm forgetting the details. This will be the earliest of the restaurants I try to recall. My apologies. I remember the service being excellent and very attentive. The food was delicious. Bottom line: I definitely would come back and probably will as this restaurant has some significance to me. This is 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Overpriced ... Awful service ... Small portions ... Never going back and hoping to save a few people from wasting their money"}
{"text":"It was a busy time went we went to try Ambiyan.  There was a Downtown Unionville festival happening on the weekend. We were seated on the patio.   To start we ordered a unique house specialty brie filled pakora - that was fantastic with the accompanying tamarind sauce, ooey gooey goodness. :)  Also had  Butter chicken - very fresh pieces of chicken breast but could use a hint more spice.  Rice - served is a nice vase container.  Naan - excellent wouldn't change a thing Aloo Gobi - excellent wouldn't change a thing  I've eaten at my fair share of indian restaurants and I'd say Ambiyan is a pretty solid choice. The quality of ingredients, presentation, freshness and taste all rank high."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever, we booked ahead when we arrived the restaraunt was half empty and the owner insisted to sit us near the entrance when the door is opened all the time and it's very cold we were with kids and couldn't accept this. When we said we booked the table ahead and we would like to sit inside the restaraunt he told us take the place or leave. We turned around and left and this ruined our evening for Tonight. Thanks for nothing, very bad service will never come again to this terrible place!"}
{"text":"Really tasty! My boyfriend and I split the vegetarian trio supreme to start (spinach pakoras, onion bhajis and potato tikka). I had the shahi paneer and he had the butter chicken. We split a side order of garlic naan and it was so fresh and tasty that we ended up ordering seconds :)"}
{"text":"OMG, I went here with my mom recently for lunch. The food was so good - I don't eat a lot of Indian food, but this place has me hooked. The restaurant itself was very nice too, and the service was great. The server clearly explained each dish, and we were both happy with our order. I will definitely be back. We also had enough leftover for another meal at home."}
{"text":"Takeaway has never been so complicated. Alas.   On a cold near-winter's night I rang up Ambiyan, having heard good things about it.  The very-youthful-sounding girl on the line wasn't sure about the things I was ordering, and I had to repeat each item. Her voice wasn't confident she knew the menu. Oh dear. Equally disappointing, the lass didn't have a price ready once I'd placed my order; upon asking, she went to check & *poof* I was inadvertently hung up on. Thank goodness I'd provided my number -she did ring me back, let me know the price, and confirm the order.  Twenty minutes later, I went in to Ambiyan to pick up my food. My order was smartly packed in a flat-bottomed paper bag with a handle. The food was in sturdy, reuseable, biodegradeable containers. Very posh, very practical. Alas, it wasn't so easy to just pay and walk off with my nice bag full of heavenly-scented Indian goodies.   A server -the same I assumed who asnwered the phone -didn't note I was paying with interac (despite my confirming over the phone that they took it & telling her when I handed over the card) -and she kept returning to me saying, \"It's expired.\" Ummm. Try again. Soon it was discovered their interac line was down (?!). It took a full 20 minutes to resolve.   During this time I was not offered anything, nor was any apology given.   It was a bustling Friday night, true, but surely servers at a professional establishment should be able to handle the traffic volume? I counted at least four servers, plus the bartender, on that night. And the restaurant wasn't full. This makes me wonder if Ambiyan's staff isn't quite as experienced as they need to be. The bartender thankfully got the wireless technology in order, but not before saying \"It's been doing this all day.\" Really? They why leave it to fix on a busy Friday night? It was kind of shocking, and reflects badly, I think, on the restaurant. That's a shame. Their food is quite good.   When I finally did get to the contents of my nice posh bag, everything was near-cold, of course. But after a quick heat-up, it was the perfect thing to fend off the late-November chills. Dhal Makhani was rich, gingery, and had a nice texture with creamy lentils and veg. Saag Paneer, one of my all-time favorite food dishes, was considerably more runny (and spicy!) than I'm used to it being, but it had a good spicy-spinach taste and generous chunks of tender paneer. Eggplant Bharta was chalk-full of veggie chunks and had a nice ginger-garlic zing to it. Kudos to the kitchen for very nice (if safe) spicing.  The naan seemed rushed -it was not fully cooked but puffed up very nicely with five minutes or so in the oven on high.  Ambiyan's food is good, not great for the price, but solid, and certainly a nice introduction for those not used to eating Indian. I would caution Ambiyan to those who a/ use interac; and b/ phone their orders in; c/ have a really low tolerance for incompetent service. A bit of training, a bit more professionalism, perhaps a slightly more experienced (and educated) wait staff... and a less timid hand in the kitchen would all work in Ambiyan's favor."}
{"text":"Food is authentic and of excellent quality. Great atmosphere. Would definitely recommend if your after the best Indian cuisine north of 401."}
{"text":"Could this place be any better?!! I've been to Ambiyan twice, both for business trips to Toronto, and it is by far my FAVORITE Indian place of all time. Seriously. The food is so delicious, and I just love that it's located in the heart of Unionville. This town is definitely a must see; it's a cute small town with a ton of character.  The first time I went to this restaurant I sat on the outside patio. The music pavilion is directly across the street and there was a band playing Beach Boys songs. Too fun. I LOVE the Vegetarian Navaraton Korma. 2 of my work colleagues ordered the Butter Chicken (wow) and the Beef Masala (which I didn't try but he loved it). This place is amazing. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went here for a private party.  Food was excellent.  All the Indian dishes have a unique flare.  The chilli mushroom was amazing. The service is great as well.  Price is average.  The best thing about this restaurant is that it is in the heart of union ville.  Very unique Indian dining experience.  I would go back door sure."}
{"text":"Just ordered Lamb Roganjosh through SkipTheDishes. Extremely disappointed with the food. It's swimming in oil. Couldn't taste anything but oil. Such a disappointment seeing that this was my first time eating their food. Never again"}
{"text":"Bringing a baby here makes you second class. The server gave us attitude because we had a stroller. We ended up leaving. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Overall score: 3.5/5  One of the few upmarket indian restos in the GTA....food, service and value:3.5/5. In relation to its Indian peers I'd say 4/5 for ambience. While overall everything was decent to good, felt it was a little overpriced.  Repeat: Maybe"}
{"text":"We came here, based on Yelp reviews as we were in the area for the Unionville festival and well craving Indian food as well (who really wants to drive to Brampton from Unionville) sad to say I kinda wish I had taken the drive.   We got to the restaurant in time to watch the end of the 3rd period of the Stanley Cup Finals - I was quite happy about that as I didn't except the restaurant to show the game.  now onto my review:  We were seated and mostly served by (who looked to me) like the owner. She was kind and answered the questions we had.  We appreciated the jug of water that came out as we would have been disappointed otherwise as the service was VERY slow.   we ordered the prefix non-veg menu which was $25/pp. It came with an app and a main.   it took quite some time to get the food in between.  Apps: the Chicken pakora and samosa. Okay so my opinion may be a bit biased as I am of Indian decent but the pakora tasted like chicken fingers and I've had better Samosas at the Cheesecake Factory in Buffalo.   Mains: Lamb & Chicken curry - again nothing to wow me- and I felt flavour was actually missing from the lamb dish. the naans we got were good.  We waiting a while to get our bill as well, we were the last customers left inside so I thought service would have been better but I felt everyone was more rushed to go home. we even heard a disagreement with (who I think is) the owner and one of the staff.  when we were paying the bill is when another individual said \"you guys picked the busiest day to come on\" to which we said \"is that why the service was so slow?\" and to which he has nothing to say, not even an apology.   to be honest - i wouldn't return."}
{"text":"WOW has the customer service gone down since then. I went there last night for a night out with girlfriends, Ive been there about 20 times in the last 5 yrs as Im a neighbour and the waiter immediately recognized me so that SHOULD count for something, plus the fact we were all dressed up and affluent looking and not teen riffraff off the street.....but I guess not. Because we were DEFINITELY treated like penniless homeless people who they never want to see again. We ordered our meals and wine and the food was good as usual but also as usual FAR OVERPRICED!!! NO meat entrees less than $19. Most appetizers $12 to $16. PLUS worst of all, when you order your entree (ie usually a curry or a meat or fish sauce based entree, the vast majority which are $20 to $30 which is VERY HIGH even for downtown Toronto and this is just out in the boonies suburbia ) it never comes with rice or naan. THAT is $5 extra. Ridiculous. Anyway when its time to pay I had a 15% off coupon (it applies to food only, not wine.) The 15 yr old looking waiter studied it for about 12 minutes of wasted time for us just sitting around and then came back with a variety of excuses why we cant use it which ranged from ; - this coupon is only good for Monday to Thurs (it doesnt say that ANYWHERE, including in the fine print. In fact it clearly says Dinners from 5pm SEVEN DAYS A WEEK) - this coupon is from a summer booklet full of coupons, its only good for summer (doesnt say that anywhere)- its expired ( no expiry date on the coupon) - my manager isnt here, I just send over another waiter (FINE)- then we go through all the same excuses again. Meanwhile Im a regular. The exasperated waiter said \"Just come back for another meal next week Monday to Thurs and you can use coupon then !\"  \"AH- Im moving out of province next week but my girlfriends who are remaining here just a block away I promise you will NEVER come here again. Why dont you just save yourself the embarrassment and give us the 15% off?\" \"Theres no embarrassment!\" \"Yes there is, there are about 15 OTHER customers here trying to have a nice quiet meal but everyone has stopped eating and talking just to be lookyloos and easedrop on this horrible customer service!\" Eventually they finally honoured the stupid coupon, even though it probably cost them only $8 but it DEFINITELY cost them future customers. Very short sighted ! Anyway, lesson learned, the next time I use a coupon anywhere I present it BEFORE ordering any food and if they give me a hard time I take my money elsewhere. Problem solved. If looks could kill all three of us would be dead by the time we left the restaurant from ALL the staff. A really horrible experience."}
{"text":"Ordered take out first, dined-in next with friends and then we were impressed enough to have our little guy's second bday here. The chicken vindaloo, the mango lassi shots , samosas, kulfi were standouts but everything we got was better than your ordinary fare Indian experience. Raj, thank you for looking after us and our guests :) we will see you more often for sure"}
{"text":"A recent adventure to Unionville Main street had my taste buds singh-ing. The evening was beautiful everything was perfect, not too hot, not too cold, an off high traffic night to visit Main street and a great friend from out of town to enjoy some of the best reviewed Indian food on the east side of the GTA. Ambiyan.   Given the wonderful evening temperature we decided to have a seat on the patio which at dusk in the summer is absolutely lovely - it overlooks the busy walking streets of Main street and being in the relatively quiet village of Unionville you quickly forget that you're about to dine at an Indian restaurant because of the cottage-y feel of this building and its patio. Pure Relaxation!  Immediately upon being seated our server brought over glasses of water and complimentary shot glasses of freshly made Mango Lassi's! Talk about adding in the little extras, it was thick, fresh and refreshing, a perfect way to start a meal. Yumm-o!  They had a great selection of beers on taps however on this night pints of steam whistle beer were the drink of choice for my companion and I.   Our waiter was a magnificent help and made strong recommendations for our meal, the best of which was suggesting that we go for the garlic Naan over the regular - well played sir.. well played (WAY BETTER). We decided to have 2 mains to share between myself and my yelptastic companion, here is what we ordered:  1) Lamb Vindaloo - beautifully made and taste with just enough heat to make us sweat but not quite enough to make it painful.   2) Prawn Curry - buttery, a flavour that filled my mouth, there was so much delicious sauce that I wished I had 2 or three other pieces of Naan to go with it to mop all this amazingness up  This place was all about the little details - you know the extra touches. The most noticeable of them aside from the free mango lassi was the unique was the basmati rice was presented. In a tiny metal bucket with a lovely and decorative scoop.  Awesome all around! Rice came in a cool little bucket of to serve your self.... very cool"}
{"text":"I love coming here during warm nights with friends or family. I love Indian food, like love it. Here, I won't say the food is the best ever, but it's a good 7/10. The flavours are good. The Brie pakoras itself have me going back.    Big tip: if you like it spicy tell them- it had no heat whatsoever - none!   Pros: location, live music if you're lucky, location, flavourful food  Cons Price- it's steepish for Indian food and the quantity --- but it's an Indian restaurant catered for non- Indians so I guess the usual family style of splitting dishes that I would do at your typical Indian restaurant doesn't happen here. It's more a curry per person   Don't forget to stop by for ice cream Or sweet treats in the area at old firehall!"}
{"text":"This place is an Indian restaurant and pub all in one. First of all, the location across from the bandstand on Main Street Unionville is fantastic, and the patio and large windows really take advantage of this. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is pretty cozy as well -- lots of wood and stone.  For a restaurant that seems to be emphasizing its pub aspects these days -- there is a sign that says \"...and neighbourhood pub\" or something similar -- there isn't a huge beer list, but what's on tap is certainly respectable. They also give you shot glasses with mango lassi when you arrive. They really prepare it well -- my wife ended up getting a full glass of it and really liked it.  For an app, we had the \"vegateable trio,\" which is spinach pakora, potato tikki and onion bhaji. All three were great and were accompanied by different sauces. Lots of spice and flavour!  For the main, I had the chicken vindaloo, and it was well prepared with lots of flavour and heat. The basmati rice and garlic naan were also great and complemented the meal well. This isn't really the most authentic Indian food, but I don't think that really matters. The menu seems really well thought out and a lot of care seems to have gone into the smaller details. For example, my wife's main had a few maraschino cherries in it, which was a nice surprise that somehow worked with her meal.  The service is excellent and helpful, and this seems like a very well run establishment.  Like all restaurants on Main Street Unionville, you're paying a bit of a premium for the location. If you just want straight-up Indian food, you can find it for a cheaper price at any number of plazas, but you won't get atmosphere like this."}
{"text":"Yes Im brown so I know my Indian food.  This place caters for the white folks.   The flavours are dull and where is the spice?????    We ordered the lamp chops.  Lamps chops are always a little pricy but always worth it right?? Not here.  They were ok and were worth five bucks, maybe then I wouldnt feel ripped off.  Then we ate the tandoori chicken.  Just by looking at it it didnt seem right.  The colour was off and the taste was even more so.  We mentioned this to our server but he didnt care.  He said this is just how they made it.  I was tempted to leave at the given moment but I had my wine to finish.  We continued to order our main: chicken tikka masala.  We asked for the 'brown version'.   I wanted a lot more spice and flavour and they listened.  They got it right!!!  It was delicious.  Maybe I should have said that for all the meals I ordered.  Oh and the naan bread, was white fluffy and freshly hot!  I found this place ok.  The service was good but some of the staff was rude.  The food can be better.  The drinks were great.  This place is over priced.  I dont think I would go out of my way to come back here.  I had heard great things about this place but it was from a non indian friend.    Ambiyan needs to spice it up!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best restaurants on Unionville Main. Great outdoor patio with umbrellas to spare, quick, excellent service and welcoming atmosphere. Ordered briyani, naan, variety of meat curries...all which were quite delicious. Their chicken samosas are a must try. Added a last minute salad to our order and our hostess was able to get it out with the rest of the appetizers. Really happy with this restaurant and their service!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE 2: just lost a customer! The manager is rude and disrespectful. I will never be returning"}
{"text":"Sometimes I just wanna go out for lunch/dinner, but have absolutely NO idea where to go. This is always a great choice when you're wandering Main Street Unionville.  A great place to go for some Indian food, as well as beautiful day on the patio. They have a nice are inside with booths and tables spread out, but a large patio that is fit for a nice summer day.  The food here is absolutely amazing, with all the different choices all being very tasty. One recommendation is to order different dishes and share, especially for the curries. I would recommend the naan bread with it too! My favorites would definitely have to be their appetizers through!  The service here is definitely on the slower side. They don't have many servers through most of the day, so it slows everything down a bit. However, if you're on the patio, it would be good just to enjoy your time there.  Definitely a recommended choice if you're in the mood for some amazing Indian food with a patio!"}
{"text":"The food there are pretty good.It's a nice place to meet with friends and have a relax afternoon. The waiter is so friendly as well."}
{"text":"A unique taste of Indian food on mainstreet Unionville! Do make reservations as they were barely able to squeeze our group of four in during dinner on a Saturday. I was happy with the variety of flavours that was in the chicken pakora; paired with a subtle chutney that was good on its own as well. The butter chicken was full of big cubes of chicken, with a smooth curry on top that paired well with the naan and rice. The curry lamb was slightly tough but the flavour was great. While the prices are slightly on the higher end for slightly smaller portions, the food was truly amazing; flavourful, well prepared, and good!"}
{"text":"I don't mind giving two start just because of location , otherwise just one for taste and service . If you need real Indian food and taste this is not the place to go . It's for some one who never had Indian and no spice ."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with some friends. The appetizer was chicken samosas served with two mysterious sauces. Now don't be put off by the word \"mysterious\". They were very new flavours to me that I ended up really appreciating. Also, everyone was served mango smoothie shots to start, which were nice and creamy.  For the main I had the lamb vindaloo with basmati rice. I came to Ambiyan looking for bold flavour and in your face seasoning, and that's what I got! Beware though; the spiciness of this dish will creep up on you. Not unbearable at all, but not a \"comfortable\" meal.  Everyone else at the table really enjoyed their meals as well.  For Indian food, I'd definitely go back and suggest it to others."}
{"text":"Came on July 3rd around 2pm. Service was horrible and all the waiters were super rude. I said \"umm\" to a question they asked and they responded with \"decide quickly so we can serve the next customer\"   Their food and drinks are on the expensive side. Happy hour is a joke. Their happy hour beers are a Molson Canadian and Coors light that are 50 cents off the regular price. Might as well go somewhere else on main street for drinks instead.   Service was slower than any we have experienced lately. We were sitting and waiting for almost an hour without any drinks or appetizers. The only good thing here was they had a patio and the weather was good that day.  Otherwise, I would have walked out after the first half an hour of sitting with water."}
{"text":"Cute Indian spot on Main Street unionville. I went there at night for Indian dinner ordering butter chicken, vindaloo lamb as well as garlic nan. Very flavourful and decent portion size. It is a bit on the pricier side but that's what you should expect on Main Street unionville."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and great food!  We were welcomed with smile as soon as we walked in and our server was friendly and professional. Deco is nice, sittings are comfortable.  We ordered non veg and veg prix fixe menu :   Appetizer + Dhaba Traditional Curry with Chicken, Muttar Paneer  +  rice and naan.  Food: Good and authentic   Service: Excellent  Price: Reasonable  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A unique restaurant when considering this is an Indian restaurant.  The owner is Punjabis and the food authentic.    What makes this restaurant differ is the ambiance.  It's located in a heritage type home on Main Street in Unionville and the inside is a modern feel and quite high end.    Further, it has a full bar area, uncommon for an Indian restaurant.  I even ordered one of my favourite beers on draft, Mill Street Tankhouse."}
{"text":"This restaurant gets 2 stars only because if it's ambiance. From an authentic indian food taste quality, it certainly is a poor one.  Despite ordering a hot and spicy what I got was a bland tasteless food.  It is not an authentic indian food."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years. They have a great amount of vegetarian options. Would totally recommend the Chana Masala and any paneer dish. The dish itself is usually around $15. But with nan bread, rice, drink and tip, be prepared to spend around $25+. The food is very filling, prepared fast, and tasty. Would recommend giving this place a visit."}
{"text":"Before East Asia decided to invade Main Street Unionville, a small part of South Asia had quietly moved in and taken up residence. Years later, as the restaurant landscape ebbed and flowed on the street, Ambiyan still confidently stood its ground, luring passerbys with spicy aromas.   Oh yeah, it's expensive. There's no doubt about that. $19 for entrees that come out as little silver bowls filled with saucy meats. But if you don't think those saucy meats will fill you up, you're wrong. I've tried the butter chicken, chicken tikka masala (curry yogurt sauce) and lamb saag (boiled seasoned spinach). All were fantastic. I alternated between shoving more in my mouth because it was so delicious and taking a long break because my tongue was on fire.   Extra $5 for rice or naan, which might be a rip off but damn it, you will absolutely need those overpriced carbs. Seriously, you can't just eat the entrees by themselves, they're practically spicy sauces. No wonder lassi drinks were invented. Nothing kills the burn better. On top of the fiery main dishes, they serve a range of appetizers. I personally think the spinach pakoras are delightful.   Yes, there may be better, cheaper, more authentic Indian food out there. I wouldn't know, I'm a noob. But there sure is something special about walking into this beautiful restaurant, looking out onto scenic Main Street, and enjoying some delicious curry. Walk by Ambiyan and take a whiff. That's the smell of amazing food...and the American dream (Okay, Canadian).  (13/100) - 2018"}
{"text":"I stepped in here just to have a light snack on a beautiful sunny weekend day.  The patio was open and I had a nice taste of one of their appetizers!  (Food:) VEGETARIAN SAMOSAS: Oooo I've really come to love samosas ever since one of my colleagues brought them to work!  And these ones were great!  WIth potatoes and peas on the inside, they were arranged artistically, but having each half split open and having a green/brown sauce on the side.   (Price:) VEGETARIAN SAMOSAS: $7    I think my Tamil friend would say that that's too much for a samosa, but I don't eat a lot of Indian food anyways haha.   (Ambience:) I didn't even step inside, but the patio was nice.  (Service:) Fine.  (Overall:) I liked it!  Vege samosas are the best!"}
{"text":"Food was ok Service was terrible Did not bring the food on time and when they did, they forgot to bring the whole order. We could not enjoy the meal together On top of that, they will charge you a 18% tip!!!!!  I would not leave them a $ for such a poor service."}
{"text":"I can not stay away from their delicious vegetarian friendly selections! My go-to place for Indian food and the lunch specials are an amazingly good deal. I can't wait to bring more family and friends there to eat. The service is friendly and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"GONNA PUT A TL;DR HERE: 1/5 - amazing food - off the chains amazing, but service is absolute garbage. Avoid.  Been here a couple times and every time I have hope that it'll be better. Please refer to previous review. Yesterday was my absolute last time coming here because of how trash the service is. Sure, your restaurant is nice and it's a perfect location on main street unionville. BUT LEARN MANNERS??? I believe they were understaffed and the hostess was the owner's wife because she was taking orders and running around too. She also wasn't in any uniform so I didn't even know she worked there to begin with.  We had our meal and then we had to ask for the bill 3 times and after saying 'seperate bills', she asked \"is that two? Or one?\" ..UMM?? Then she asks how to seperate it.. when there are only two items on the menu.. ?? Huh?? When my receipt came out of the card machine, I ripped the cardholder copy off as I normally do when the waitress decides to ditch the table mid-transaction. However this time, the top of the machine came loose and the roll of receipt paper fell out. She rushed back and said sternly \"WHY DID YOU DO THAT????\" and glares at us and pretty much yells (or says in a voice definitely louder than your indoor voice) \"Do you know you're not supposed to open this?? Now I lose my copy\" before slamming down the machine and my copy on the table. Yes, slamming. She thought I opened the machine for fun and kept glaring the entire time as my friend paid for his meal.   A. When these kinds of situation happen, are you not supposed to be nicer about it to the customer & say something like \"next time, please refrain from asjdskdjhfkshbfalsjdlasd..\"  B. Pretty sure you can go to functions and print out another receipt. Prettttty sure ambiyan isn't from the 1960's and doesn't have the option to reprint.   After my friend paid, she grabbed the machine and didn't say a word before turning on her heel and stomping away. Not a thank you, not anything .. kinda wanna take my tip back?   So not going anymore and unless you want SHIT service, I advise you to spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love Indian food but usually don't get the chance to eat it often because it's not my fam's typical meal. So if I ever get to eat out with friends and get Indian food, I get excited.   Going to Ambiyan was a really nice experience. Even though we weren't able to get outoor seating on the patio because they were super busy and there was live music on the bandstand, their interior was decent - not as nice as outdoor seating on a nice cool summer evening, but at least we were nice and fresh away from outdoor heat.   Ambiyan has a Prix Fixe Menu (if you don't want to order a la carte) that comes in either vegetarian or non-vegetarian options.  Vegetarian Prix Fixe Menu ($21): Appetizer - choice of Spinach Pakora or Aloo Tikki Main: Choice of one Veg main course from their veg section of the menu Side: basmati rice or freshly baked naan (you can have it buttered or plain)   Non-vegetarian Prix Fixe Menu ($26): App - chicken samosa or chicken pakora Main - choice of one main from either the poultry or meat section  Side - basmati rice or freshly baked naan   My friend got the non-veg prix fixe and ordered... Chicken pakora - chickpea battered and deep fried chicken breast served with tamarind chutney. This was my fave app out of the two we ordered. The crunch from being deep-fried alongside the juiciness and dense texture of chicken breast was perfect. The tamarind chutney was a nice more sweet than sour accompaniment.   Dhaba chicken curry - traditional spicy street food chicken curry from Northern India. She liked it a lot. Not heavy and won't leave you feeling greasy or bloated. Great flavours.  Side of basmati rice - delish. She was given a good portion.  There was a lot to eat - she had to take some of it home.  I got the veg prix fixe menu and got... Spinach pakora - seasoned baby spinach pucks lightly battered and deep fried. These were yummy and soft and slightly crispy. I do prefer the chicken pakora though but this is a good vegetarian option.  Navartan Korma - a mix of seasonal vegs in a cashew cream sauce with pineapple, mushrooms, paneer, and cashews. I really really liked this dish. Packed full of yummy veggies in a creamy warm sauce... it was delicious.  As a side, I ordered naan (buttered) and it's got to be one of the best-tasting naans that I've had.   I would definitely go here again and do recommend it to anyone looking for good Indian cuisine. The prices are higher than what you would expect from a smaller store-front that caters more to the takeout style and sharing food style. The dishes here are intended per person but don't let that stop you from sharing the flavourful bites with your friends and family. I really like how the prix fixe menu is set up - it's a great way for first-timers to sample their menu. And don't worry if you might not understand some of the culinary terms on the menu (like naan, roti, paneer, etc.) - there are definitions listed throughout the menu as a guide."}
{"text":"What a warm and friendly food haven! The food is delicious, served in healthy portions, prices are fair and you will feel well taken care of. AMBIYAN is one of the best places to experience delicious Indian food in Ontario. Thank you Raj & the staff!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Ambiyan for about 5 years now after trying out a bunch of Indian restaurants in Unionville & Markham. Service is really good, food is excellent. It's the only place we go to for Indian now. I have taken so many friends & colleagues and they love the food! Once you are seated they bring you a refreshing mango & yogurt drink (complimentary). Some fav items: Butter chicken, Chana masala, Chicken korma & Beef tenderloin masala - they're fresh made naan is out of this world! Love that they have a patio and they are in the heart of main street Unionville!"}
{"text":"One of the best patio places to eat on Unionville! It's right at the core and it isn't cramped like some other places. We were also fortunate to eat at a time where a lady played the electrical violin. Upon seated, we were given a mango shake sample. Boy was it yummy! I think this drink is suppose to compliment their spicy dishes. We ordered their chicken korma, butter chicken poutine, saffron rice and garlic naan. To our delight, everything was delicious. They give a good amount of chicken in the korma and the cashew cream sauce is amazing with rice or na an. We thought the poutine would come with cheese, but it actually didn't. When we asked the waiter, he said it should have, and returned our poutinewith fresh pieces of Parmesan. We still don't know if it was suppose to be like that or with just the butter chicken sauce and fries. Anyways, the butter chicken sauce is also amazing. We were able to eat our sides with the butter chicken sauce as well; instead of ordering the meat dish and spending extra money. I highly Recommend getting their naan. The garlic naan is amazing!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Decent service and decent food. This used to be a steak chop house over several years ago. Now it's half Indian cuisine and half traditional bar food. Great taste with their SouthAsian dishes."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I ventured up to this place. The meal was very nice. Typical Punjabi North Indian fare. Everything was hot and fresh with pretty good service considering the place was jam packed for Saturday night. Will return"}
{"text":"Respectable Indian food but not the best.  There are some creative dishes, like the the Brie pakoras and the presentation is nice. But they miss the mark on the value versus quality.  Plus there is no Korma on the menu... Unforgivable. The best thing I tried was the lamb biryani. Give that a shot!  Overall not bad and worthy of 4 stars based on ambiance and quality ingredients."}
{"text":"5/5  Location: Main Street Unionville - great location, parking available behind the restaurant or down the street  Menu: Lots of great options for Indian food, and also a menu for Western food, so something for everyone. I tried the lunch prix fixe menu where I chose the vegetarian samosa, butter chicken (freaking delicious!), and buttered naan (next time I'll opt for plain). The food was so flavourful and delicious. Portion sizes were as expected.  Price: A bit on the pricier side, but worth it.  Service: Amazing service - very attentive, not very long of a wait, and great recommendations on the menu items."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here. Probably the best north Indian food that I have ever had.  Food was delicious and the presentation was inviting. We got a few dishes from vegetable biriyani, navaratan kurma and butter chicken. My friends loved the butter chicken and I savored every bite of my vegetarian food. I was delighted by the raita that was served for us to share. It was decorated with pomegranate seeds and was delicious.  We stayed almost past restaurant closing hour and they did not come disturb us or ask us to leave. Service was wonderful and the whole place was very cozy. I would love to come back here some time."}
{"text":"Great location in unionville. The butter chicken was good. Everything else that came out was a bit cold and below average. Do not order the chicken pakora... it isn't very good. Nothing unique here.  I had a great time with my friends on the patio, having a few drinks. I'd come back to order the few dishes that are A-OK , grab some drinks and enjoy the weather.  Service - probably understaffed that day but they tried their best. 4/5"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a full 5 star if they could have chosen more comfortable and better designed high-chairs for shorter persons.  I am 5'4\" but I had both my feet landed on nothing the whole time during my meal.  My legs were numb when I left my seat.  I love those high-tables and high-chairs setting at the covered balcony level next to the patio.  However, I wish I were at least 2 inches taller lol.  Alright, other than the high-chairs, everything was perfect for me.  The service was very friendly and attentive since we entered the restaurant.  I enjoyed my Mojito.  We ordered food to share.  We had Chicken Samosas to start with (it tasted good but the pastry was a bit too dry), Garlic Naan (yum...), Beef Biryani and Lime Lamb (heavy but yummy).  There were basically too much food for two persons.  We ended up packed home half of the beef biryani and lime lamb.  The restaurant is located just opposite to the Square on Unionville Main Street.  Their patio is certainly a nice spot to have some food and drinks while enjoying a festival performance at the Square, if any."}
{"text":"Was the Main St. Unionville and wanted to grab something to eat. Three of us ventured in for lunch.   My friend ordered a Chicken Naan Indian Style Panzerotti. She enjoyed it.  My hubby ordered the set lunch menu for $25, you can an app & main. He ordered Chicken Paroka and Chicken Korma, came with Naan and a Yogurt Pomegranate Sauce. I tried a bit of his and it ok. The naan bread was really fresh and soft!   I also ordered the the set lunch menu for $20 (vegetarian menu). My app was Potato As miss. It was 1 huge samosa with 2 sauces on the plate. It was also ok. My main was Paneer Biryani, it was delicious! They sprinkled a lot of fried onions on top, it added an extra texture to the rice. Flavour was full and portion was quite big.   Overall I enjoyed my own Biryani the most. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent butter chicken and lamb rogan josh. Good samosas. Overall a very nice indian spot."}
{"text":"The location of this place makes it  awesome. At the historic Unionville, you can sit out in the patio and enjoy the view. It's very relaxing. The food is expensive but made very well. We really enjoyed the veggie appetizer platter. Service is quite good and free parking is at rear. I'd give it 5 stars only for the location (and not for the Indian food option)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Indian restaurants anywhere. Food is always fantastic. Service is always very good. Nice big patio when the weather permits. I definitely recommend this restaurant for delicious Indian food."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but a nice change. This place has great Indian food, plus offers some pub favourites for those that don't like Indian cuisine ( this is a great compromise for my family). The non meat options are plentiful and so many things on the menu I want to try. Had the Korma, and really enjoyed it. The garlic naan was nice, and the pompodoms very nice. My wife also enjoyed her Tikka chicken. Parking is a little tight, but worth the effort. We will return."}
{"text":"Third time here and food was great once again. The patio is nice for the summer, close to live music on certain nights. Inside had a cozy feel to it. They currently have a $25 non vegetarian and $20 vegetarian deal which includes an appetizer, main dish and rice or naan. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with two coworkers, one of them is an Indian, on a Friday.  Ours was the only table for the entire time.  I ordered a Lamb Vindaloo with rice from the lunch combo.  The Vindaloo curry was the spiciest I have ever had.  I knew that Vindaloo curry was a really spicy curry. Yet my Indian coworker agreed that the Vindaloo curry here was too spicy even compared to the version in her homeland.  On the positive side, my coworkers said their food tasted good.   The venue was beautifully decorated.  The services was fine.  The waiter was polite and effective (bear in mind that we were the only customers the entire time).  And echo other reviewers, the food was expensive.  A non-vegetarian lunch combo costed $20 per person.  A vegetarian lunch combo costed $15."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food, some of the best I've ever had. Loved the variety of Vegetarian options. So many authentic and tasty plates to choose from, great flavors and spices. I am a fan."}
{"text":"I found this place to be over priced for the amount of food you get. You are paying for the nicer \"fine dining\" atmosphere as opposed to quantity of food. The kicker was the 18% already added gratuity on the bill. The waiter was not around much, to warrent an 18% gratuity. If you want authentic, more quantity, better quality Indian food, I would not suggest this place. However, if you want fine dining Indian food, and you don't mind over paying, then come here."}
{"text":"Short version of the review - food is good but value is missing.  $25 for shrimp in curry sauce is a bit overly priced if you ask me. The shrimps were fairly large and you get about 5-6 pieces of shrimp included. Sold separately is the garlic naan at $4. The flavor of the curry was decent but lacked in flavor in comparison to the butter chicken. The curry was not spicy at all which I thought was a big miss especially when dinning at an Indian restaurant. There should at least be an option if you want to add some hot sauce.   The butter chicken was part of the lunch special and for $18 you also get one vegetable samosa and the plain naan was included.   Flavors were good overall but I keep comparing to other places I have had Indian food. Bombay Bhel definitely better flavor overall and although the garlic naan was good it doesn't compare to the one I had at The Bombay Grill and for half the price too.   I know Ambiyan is a higher class restaurant and it shows with the service but its not worth the money when I can easily get the same quality food for half the price at other Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"Good food but poor service and a little high on price but would still recommend if your not in a hurry.  Came to this place with three other friends when the place was almost empty. There were maybe 2 other tables occupied when we got there. There was three of is to start so we figured we'd order and have the food ready for when the 4th got there. It took prob half an hour for our 2 samosas and one other app to come. But luckily we were in no hurry and enjoyed good conversation. It took prob another half an hour for our three dishes and rice to come.  With ordering when the restaurant was almost empty I'd expect a much faster meal then an hour. By the time our mains came the restaurant was almost full and we never saw the waiter again accept for the very odd beverage fill. Even when we were done eating and finished our beers at the end it took another half an hour for the waiter to notice. A table of 10, beside us, came half way through our meal and had paid before us.   On top of that I thought the prices of the dishes were on the high side for the size of the dishes. We were full by the end but up to $25 for a single dish seems high especially for the size of it, compared to other places I've been to.    Overall, if we had been in any sort of hurry instead of catching up with friends, I probably would have been even less happy with the restaurant. However, the food was tasty and we all left full. Looking at other reviews this appears to happen every so often with certain waiters so I would still recommend trying it yourself and either hope for a good waiter or be ready to constantly flag one down."}
{"text":"We went on a recent venture on one of the most beautiful weekends this summer.  I really wanted a patio, and Mr. really wanted Indian food so we...compromised and went to Ambiyan - and I'm so glad we did!   We ordered two prix fixe's - a veg and a non-veg one.  We tried the chicken korma and the paneer and they were both fantastic.  Their appetizers with the prix fixe's were small so it made me wonder if I had ordered a real appetizer, if their portions would have been bigger.  However, we both walked out with bellies extremely full.    The service was alright - it seemed like we were sort of being rushed to order and rushed to leave and there wasn't actually hoards of people waiting.  So I was a bit confused about that.    Overall, I would come back again for the food :)"}
{"text":"good food, good service. the place don't look like your typical indian place. they play who's bad (MJ) music. I ordered a standard indian dishes, butter chicken and Beef Tenderloin Vindaloo (extra spicy) but it turned out the beef wasn't spicy enough. but it was good nevertheless. the chicken on the other hand is too dry. but the curry was quite nice. So the dish left with Chicken only. (lol) side of garlic nan. the food come out in 5 min (very fast), but again, probably most of the food has been cooked anyway. (typical curry). the mango lassi was thick and sweet. great place, but need to find another better restaurant."}
{"text":"Ive been to this restaurant a few times because of their high quality food and service. Great lamb biryani! Also loved their saag paneer. Naan was also fresh and tasty. Their lemonade though (tasted a bit powdery) went down like juice but dangerously loaded!"}
{"text":"Mmmm, I want more!  Visited this location without a reservation on a Monday evening with some girlfriends. There was no need for reservations. Our server was friendly and patient. He brought up this mango yogurt stuff which was actually so delicious (and on the house).   I ordered chardonnay and my meal from the veg pre-fixe menu. Spinach pakoras & saag paneer with rice and a side order of butter naan ($4). My bill came shy of $40, tip+tax included. It was worth it!  My pakoras were delish. The sauce they serve along side perfectly compliment the appetizer. The four of us were raving about it. The saag paneer could have used a bit more spiciness but all in all, very flavourful. I liked the big pieces of julienne ginger. The naan is where it's at. Be sure to get that. I tried to stay moderately healthy with my rice but didn't even touch it in the end. I was so obsessed with the naan.    I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"fabulous high quality Indian food. The meat is divine, the sauces delicious and variety is very good. This is a place we frequent often when we go out for dinner in the area. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Start your evening off right with a mango shot at Ambiyan. Add in a lovely summer evening and the patio, delicious food, an equally interesting dinner mate and you're all set!  We ordered the coconut prawn curry and lamb vindaloo with sides of garlic naan and rice. The prawns were just as prawns should be... a decent mouthful. And the curry... smooth and coconutty. Go figure! The lamb vindaloo, now that was my favourite - mostly because lamb anything is my favourite. It was a bit spicy, but my spice tolerance is incredibly low. Mix that up with a bit of rice, scoop it all with a piece of that naan bread... mmmm, I'm drooling at the memory!  Expect to spend a wee bit more, this ain't no cheap Indian buffet. But the \"ambiyan-ce\" coupled well well cooked food and service to match the higher-endishness of this resto make this a solid 4 stars in my books."}
{"text":"Yeah so for some reason we had a horrible experience here and spontaneously decided to try this place again because the patio looked poppin while driving by.  Ordered a bunch of stuff like beef curry, samosas, kebab, fake tandoori chicken , lamb racks, biriyani.  Nothing was authentic, im almost 100% sure they dont have a real tandoor oven, the chicken and kebab had no flavour.  The samosa was supposed to be chicken but it was mixed with so much potato you would never know.  I got a pretty strong stomach but i had to vomit after i came home, and this is the second time after eating here this happened.  They have really good service though if you wAnt to hang out on the patio and have a drink, and if you want to test your immune system try the food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian restaurant with a look and feel of a traditional pub. Right in Unionville my wife and I popped in on a cold January afternoon for lunch and totally loved it. Service was fast and very friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Ordered it for takeout and dreamed about it for weeks after!  Loved the butter chicken, Korma, Tikka Masala.  Will order again for sure!"}
{"text":"Good food. Came here on a sunday night restaurant was dead had 3 tables. Server was good and friendly. Explained some of the dishes well. Pretty authentic indian food.   Just a turn off on how they made two restaurants \"\" and menu \"\" in one place. The authenticity of the Indian vibe fades away."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times before and have not had a bad or even mediocre meal here. They are consistently impressive here.   The quality of ingredients and prime location makes it a top choice in the area. Being at the end of historic Main St Unionville it's a nice spot to walk around while digesting the meal.   We were a table of four, we had the butter chicken, beef vindaloo, saag paneer, and beef tenderloin masala, 2 orders of basmati rice and 3 orders of naan bread. Everything was so flavorful and perfectly cooked. The whole experience was great, the server had a good sense of humor. When one member of our group wanted to verify the rice was done before he took it away, he left the dishes on the table which came across as odd, but didn't pay much mind to it. Another member of our group asked for a beverage and they didn't have 2 out of the 3 ingredients, the server told us that they don't sell a lot of alcoholic beverages, and they no longer keep many options stocked.   Overall we enjoyed our meal, and would definitely recommend it to anyone and we will be back again as well."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised about the taste and ambiance of this place. Nestled in Main Street Unionville, is this cozy gem offering extremely tasty Indian cuisine.  I came here for lunch and ordered chicken pakoras which were flavourful and just the right size....veg samosas which were fat full of potatoes and peas filled served with tamarind chutney, malai kofta, chicken korma, matar palao, and plain naan.  All items were extremely tasteful, especially the matar palao (peas and rice pilaf) it was buttery, sautéed in brown onions and drenched in gheee...just the way I like it.  Their mains are on a bit pricey side, but I guess that's what one pays for, being the venue is in a \"touristy\" spot.  Great food!"}
{"text":"This classy Indian restaurant in charming Unionville has great ambiance and good food.  Nestled in quaint little downtown Unionville, Ambiyan delighted us from the moment we first saw it. The outside of the restaurant has a homestead-y kind of feel to it: a wooden picket fence, outdoor tables, and a porch leading up to the front door. The inside was equally delightful, with artwork on the walls, stylish furniture, and lots of seating room.  We weren't sure what to order, so we got the four-course tasting menu. The first course, the appetizers, was mediocre and didn't strike us as very authentic. The second course, sorbet, was just a palate cleanser, but a good one. The third course, the main meal, was the star. We got to pick up to 6 dishes to try and share, and they were all delicious. Our favorites were the rogan josh, the spicy seafood curry, and the palak paneer. The garlic naan was also divine. Finally, the fourth course, the desert, was also wonderful, but we didn't eat too much since we were already stuffed.  The whole experience was tasty and relaxing. The service was quite slow, so we spent more time here than we wanted to. But if you have time to spare and want a classy meal, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"I would have loved to give this place a higher rating but the kitchen was unbelievably slow on a Friday night. We waited close to an hour for our food to arrive. Would have felt better if they gave us some naan or our drinks that we ordered. The server was friendly and apologetic. The garlic naan is a must order. The vindaloo we asked for extra spicy and it did have plenty of heat (though supposedly there's another heat level above ours). The mushroom and beef curry is also very tasty. Again, we enjoyed our food on the patio but will not return on a prime time evening unless we had all evening to lounge and not hungry."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for Valentine's Day. We really enjoyed the idea of having a special menu for the day. It was a set menu, other than having a choice for vegetables (we ordered lentils) and 2 meat dishes, all of which were delicious. I ordered the beef tenderloin with curry and mushrooms and she ordered butter chicken and both were not too spicy. It included an appetizer (samosa and chicken), Nann bread, rice and 2 different desserts. Overall, the environment was very cozy. The only drawback was the waiting time before each course, but then again it was Valentine's Day, so it was expected to be busy."}
{"text":"Beautiful place tucked in the main street unionville area. Not an overly extravagant place, but nice and down to earth. The restaurant itself isn't crowded in the same area with the other ones so even if you sit on the patio you won't really hear/see other diners.  Yes, the food isn't the most flavourful but not to say its bland either; just not as strong as you would imagine it to be, especially if you grew up with Indian food. The ambiance is nice and quiet; they also have a bar section at the front of the restaurant. Service wasn't the most efficient but the waiters were nice and patient with your orders. They also have patio seats available, which would be nice in the summer to have a drink or dine with friends since the area isn't super busy or loud.  Upon being seated, you get complimentary shot-sized glasses of mango lassi's, which was nice to sip on while you look at the menu. If you're not familiar with Indian food, the waiters/owner is pretty helpful, and won't try to recommend you the pricier dishes. If you're at an Indian restaurant, naans are a must! They came fresh and warm (the garlic one was definitely more flavourful); the rice was quite fragrant and went well with their sauces.  Presentation of the dishes also had bonus points. Everything was neatly prepared and carefully placed on your table so no spills or splashes anywhere. Price is a bit steep for the quantity and somewhat quality but for the area this place is in, it's pretty understandable."}
{"text":"If i had to rate them based solely on dining in, i would give them 4.5 stars. Food is always fresh, warm, good sized portions and the service has always been consistent and good.  Delivery (Skip the Dishes etc.) on the other hand: 2 stars! Many items were wrong, all the curries were watered down with barely any meat of chicken, some items were even missing. I felt like i had ordered from a completely different restaurant than the one i had been frequenting for over 8 years.  Note to self: no more delivery from Ambiyan!"}
{"text":"Excellent flavors.  Nothing is overstated.  The lamb vindaloo was amazing.  The vegetable samosas were also great.  The icing on the cake was the service.  I've eaten there twice and had a young gentleman serve us both times.  He is very accommodating and  always smiling."}
{"text":"The flavors were very good. The best indian food i have ever had and the staff were so kind and gracious. It had a family feel and was very clean. It was also the most expensive indian food i had. For what you got it was a bit overpriced"}
{"text":"Stopped for some cold drinks at their village pub on a Sunday afternoon. Sweet service and highly recommends the chicken and vegetable samosas the food but will be back for a bigger bite.  Definitely a spot to hit in Markham as there does not seem to be too much entertainment in this laid back town.  Only downfall was there was street food being served and sold but if you bought it you could not eat on patio.  Very off so this was the only eyebrow raise."}
{"text":"chicken pakora and tandoori sampler tasted bland. Fish had a very potent taste (not pleasant). Very little chutney and it had too much food colouring. Not authentic  long wait for appetizers. They should serve papaddum during the 15-20 min wait.  the mains were good (lamb vindaloo and butter chicken) but not enough naan was served  overall it was a little pricey for the quality and amount given"}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the photos taken up-close of their food. Be prepared to lighten your wallet for a meal that wouldn't even fill my dog.  Since I was taking a park walk nearby with my puppers and my best friend, we decided to drop by a restaurant on mainstreet as most of them offer outdoor seating, suitable for enjoying a meal and not having to worry whether your puppy is allowed to stay with you :)  The service is a little absent. When i walked into the restaurant, I was practically ignored for a few minutes, and after being seated, the waiter was quite unavailable for the rest of my stay. Well, he did offer a seat for my puppers and give them a water bowl at my request, which was fairly appreciated.   We ordered their non-vegetarian prix fixed meal ($25) with lamb kebob (appetizer), butter chicken (main), and garlic butter naan (substitute side). A chicken pekora appetizer was also added ($10) to our meal.   The portions are very small for the price as I mentioned earlier. The lamb kebob was more like a small sausage, sliced and pieced through the centre with a skewer but served with the skewer removed. It comes with a light, citrus green sauce which compliments the rustic lamb taste quite well.  The chicken pekora was served with small fried bits of wonton skin. Evrything in this dish seemed as if they left it in the fryer and completely forgot about it, causing the chicken to be hard and dry.  The garlic naan was flat with garlic butter spread on only one side and having completely charred on the other side. The butter chicken wasn't special, wasn't the best I've had. Dry chicken and a curry sauce, not rich enough with butter.  Mainstreet had a nice atmosphere to it, but taste is king: and despite my lack of expertise in this cuisine, I've had much much better."}
{"text":"Rating is based on 3 and higher = I will go back, under 3 = I won't.  So that's my premise for rating this restaurant as a 2.  PS. It was a Friday night dinner with my gf.  First and for most, I found the service to be kinda lacking which is weird after seeing all the good reviews.  We requested a booth seat and was denied.  Only to have another couple within 10 mins be seated at a booth.  Hmm... As well, during dinner never once did they check in with us to see how things were going.  However, I did see the GM/owner check in with almost every table but ours.  Weird right?  As well, we found the server to almost treat every table better than ours.  How do we know, we had tables of 2 surrounding us.  Maybe seeing a young chinese couple = bad tip?  Too bad for them, I'm not of this stereotype... but too late.  Looks like they made that decision based on appearance right away.  We got the veggy samosas which was okay, not bad.  But at $7 for 2, it's gotta at be okay or else it's a rip off.  For our mains we ordered the butter chicken and lamb vindaloo.  The butter chicken was a pretty big disappointment for me.  It was dry and there weren't a lot of chicken pieces.  Paying $17 and I count 7 pieces?? that's not good considering not all pieces were even big ones.  The sauces were alright but nothing special.  The Lamb Vindaloo was good and spicer than other places I've been.  But it was definitely the winner out of the two dishes.  We got naan and basmati pilaf.  The naan was standard but the rice was done pretty well.  So overall, why the 2?  The dishes with tax came to 57.07.  For me, it just wasn't worth it.  I'm willing to pay for good indian and after all the good reviews, we thought Ambiyan would be a good choice.  It wasn't.  And for this price, there's just too many options.  Even for uptown, I would much rather go to Bombay Bhel at hwy 7.  Or if you're downtown, the options are plentiful.  Host over at the Annex.  Unfortunately from what I saw and experienced, Ambiyan, I won't be back.  PS.. service matters, sucks maybe we came during an off night?"}
{"text":"Went there with my boyfriend for Valentines Day dinner & the dinner fab!  Best Pecora! Butter chicken & beef vindaloo to die for & as always service is great.  This is our second time there & we will be back.  Great idea to go on valentines day as they had a prix fix menu which we took advantage of as was able to try different things we have not ordered before.  Also their samosa's were to die for!"}
