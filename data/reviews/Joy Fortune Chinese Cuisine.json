{"text":"Was here for lunch 
Food was good at a ok price for Chineese. 
The menu is TOOO long 

I think the flavours were a little bland as I have had better elsewhere. 

But the nice staff made up for the slight blandness."}
{"text":"Whenever I have cravings for 'Steam Crab with rice in a bamboo basket' I come here. For $20 you get a whole steam vancouver crab on a fried rice style. Its very like flavour infused with garlic and some egg in it as well. 

Another good add-on with this dish is also one of my fav is 'Steam egg & green onion'. The egg texture is very smooth and soft like a jello style, but its so tasty it really goes well with the rice. I have tried the double lobster special for $24 with vermicelli as well. This is a bit better than the standard green onion & ginger. Anyways this place is worth a try and definitely a nice try if you go for the dishes I have mentioned...

3.5 Star overall for this place...And its open late until 3AM...Good for nightowls!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with my girlfriend hoping to experience the same level of service and food quality that other Yelpers have been raving about.

Sadly, my experience was not as great as the other reviewers, and I'll explain below as to the reasons why. 

It does seem like an authentic Chinese restaurant, and the menus and signage leaves little help for their English speaking patrons. While this is not a bad thing, the waiters have difficulty expressing the dishes to those who can't speak Cantonese or Mandarin. 

There are so many menus. I counted at least 4 and needless to say this is a bit overwhelming. I'm sure there is considerable overlap but in the future the restaurant would be wise to consolidate their menus into one or two to make it easier for customers. 

The food was bland, especially when compared to other Chinese restaurants and I wasn't thrilled with any particular dish. The food was prepared quickly and brought in several different plates so you can tell that the restaurant basically uses whatever dishes they can find. There was absolutely no uniformity, and it reminded me of when I used to eat in the school cafeteria. 

The restaurant location was not the best but was in a plaza with extremely limited parking. It was a real struggle to find a space but this can't be blamed on the restaurant. What the restaurant can be blamed for is outright lying about their merchant terminal. The restaurant is open till 3am which is nice for late night eating.

When presented with the bill, I asked to pay by credit card. The gentleman serving our table boldly said no credit card. So I asked to pay by debit and he said they only take cash. I know this isn't true because I saw others paying by their cards but he refused to let me pay either by credit/debit. I had to leave my girlfriend at the restaurant and drive to a bank in the rain to take out $50 to pay for the meal. 

Needless to say, this last point is where the restaurant lost me forever as a customer."}
{"text":"I am disheartened to hear that this restaurant has closed, because I enjoyed their beef noodle very much. The price was really good for the portion, which was a huge portion that I would not be able to finish if I was half full."}
{"text":"I came here for a family dinner last week. We ordered a variety of items: Peking duck, deep fried crab, lobster, etc. Portions were large and pricing was very reasonable. 

10 of us shared 8-9 dishes not including dessert, and it was ~ $17 per person including tip and tax. Oh how I miss Toronto Chinese food."}
{"text":"Reliable joint for reasonably priced Chinese comfort food.

Food (3: Good)
Generally, the food is good; we have been here many times and have not had a reason to complain about the food. The menu is huge with focus on Cantonese cuisine.

Service (3: Good)
It seems that they have loyal serving staff who have been with them for a long time. And, they are knowledgeable about the menu. The service depends on how busy the place is; it ranges from great and personal during quiet time to inattentive during peak time. This place also handles high volume take out which could slow down dine in customer orders during peak time.

Ambiance (2: OK)
Casual and is extremely noisy during peak time. There is a waiting area which prevents or limits people waiting in line from hovering over tables near the entrance.

Surroundings (2: OK)
Located at a small strip plaza nearby residential area in northwest Scarborough. The small parking lot is quickly filled up during peak time which would force diners to park at neighbouring plaza parking lot."}
{"text":"Good place to grab some casual Cantonese food in Scarborough. Note, that the staff do not speak much English, so ordering might be more difficult if you do not speak Cantonese (I speak from experience). That being said they do have some menus in English, so if you are comfortable with a more limited selection, and pointing at the items you want then you would do alright.

This restaurants like many Chinese restaurants is best when going with a crowd. I always find it hard to eat dinner at a place like this since most of their dishes are made for sharing, with a large crowd.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Scarborough. I always enjoy coming here for the great food. Always get the same thing, although they have a menu that is as long as the bible... I think they have over 100 menu offerings. When we go here, we tend to share the chicken chow mein and a beef hotplate (which was recommended by the staff) and it became my favorite food on their menu. The bill is usually around 20$, and the portions are huge! 

The staff speak very little English, so sometimes it takes a few minutes to get the order in. Also, I recommend you ask the staff to read back your order, or you might end up with a few extra plates (it happened). They're not too happy to take the order back."}
{"text":"We had the Spicy Eggplants with Pork on rice and the Spicy Fried Noodles...Portions were more than generous for the price at any Chinese restaurant that I've been to in the GTA...not very spicy, and when enquired they said it's spicy enough for the patrons in the area, and that could make it more or less spicy is requested...also we had 4 servings of the green onions with ginger(free side in most Chinese restaurants), and again the portions were quite generous even though it was free...with food and drinks, it was under $15...!!! And unlike a lot of the Chinese restaurants, these folks work hard to please you and should be rewarded with a minimum of 20% tip...Bon Appetite...!!!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, tried it in the dead of night (2 AM) and was served within 10 min of ordering.  Owner was extremely polite and accomodating, creating our custom vegetarian dishes without any fuss.  Restaurant had a low scale feel but is clean (washrooms included) and has decent prices and quantities.  Good spot for informal meal with friends - especially late at night!"}
{"text":"Bullet Pointing this place:
- They have your Cantonese fare, which ranges from fried rice, rice noodles, to stir fried seafood in XO sauce..mmmMmmm
- They have like 4 menus for you as soon as you sit down, so they have a pretty large menu full of variety
- Their lunch specials are pretty decently priced. $6.50 for a noodle or rice type dish plus a drink.
- The flavours are okay - a little bland. I much prefer Congee Wong for things like Yeung Chow Fried Rice, and garlic stir-fried vegetables
- They cook intestines in five different ways. The one i got with garlic leek flowers and bean sprouts were REALLY good."}
{"text":"Really a 2.5 for late night nibbles.  Being late and not much to choose from at 1am, we settled to give this place a try. Having no one else in the restaurant we had the choice of any table and expecting undistracted service.  We were given menus and tea and the servers disappeared...  They emerged at 125 and asked if we were ready?!?  Placed an order for 1 hot and sour soup, fried noodles and chili salt shrimp.  The soup came out 10 mins later and smelled a little fishy (yes they had shrimps inside but not very fresh ones mind you) and lots of peppercorns (not my cuppa tea but hey, I have been called strange), the noodles come out and while the plate of noodles was huge the toppings were few and far between.  Must have been a busy day. And after a half hour wait our shrimps came out, all 7 of them. They were OK but the bed of fried vermicelli was largerbthan the serving of shrimp.  We also ordered a few beers that would set you back 5.00/ bottle, kinda steep for a Chinese joint. At 215 they said they were closing and gave us the cheque.  We gave plastic and waitress automatically enters all the numbers and presets your tip at 15% and taps your card for u. Wtf?
At that point I was just not pleased and will definitely not return with that type (or lack of service and expect a 15% tip for sub par food and non existent service."}
{"text":"When I'm here, I usually go for their Egg & Sausage Fried Rice and the Hot & Sour Soup. It's quick and easy to eat. And hey, what can possibly go wrong with this combo?! 

Costs is reasonable, portions are big and a very friendly/humorous staff. I was quite disappointed with one of their dishes though. My boyfriend and his friends came for the Cucumbers and Black Fungus in the past and they said it was pretty darn delicious. We ordered that and it looked nothing like how it was served to my boyfriend and his friends. It literally tastes like what it looks like. You don't even need too much imagination for this... so imagine a plate, half of it is covered in thick sticks of cucumber while the other half is just covered with the black fungus. I was drizzled with a tangy sauce on the side which I believed it was red vinegar with chili peppers... The black fungus tasted like nothing... it was pretty much just bowled and served and as for the cucumbers... it tasted like cucumbers! Nothing special in taste. The sauce did not do much justice... Yeah, pretty disappointed.

However, if you're looking for some quick and decent chinese food, this is a good place to start."}
{"text":"Mega Sized?! 

Joy Fortune Chinese Cuisine's lunch special is huge! For $6.50 that includes a drink that can feed 2 of me! 

We shared Beef with Rice Noodle and Congee with Oyster. I have no idea how we finished both?!  

Food is not bad but I had better version of both somewhere else. 

Staffs are friendly and nice. 

All these alcoholic drinks: wine, shoju, sake, rum and beers lining up on one side of the shelf?! Apparently beers here are $3 tax in... 

Maybe I should be here having midnight snack instead!"}
