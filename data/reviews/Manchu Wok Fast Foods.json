{"text":"Awesome food, awesome customer service, my favorite is the sweet and sour pork and their noodles. I highly recommend this place if  you want a quick and quality Chinese food."}
{"text":"I've been to several Manchu Wok franchises over the years. Are they five star restaurants no, however usually you can expect yummy Asian fast food. This place deserved my first ever 1 star rating the chicken was like rubber we couldn't even eat it! Although the mall has very few choices for lunch your best to avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"When I was a teenager I used to work for a Manchu Wok.  I seem to remember the quality and quantity of food being far better back then.  We used to serve a generous mound of rice with two sides for $5.  Yes inflation.....  20 years later you now get one item with steamed rice for almost $7.  Rice is chunky and stale with a tiny mound of veggies on the side of the plate & it's a tiny portion.  And it doesn't taste all that great sadly ...."}
