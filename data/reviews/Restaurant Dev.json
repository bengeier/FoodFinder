{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurant in West Island. Service and taste is really good. All food prices were really cheap and best."}
{"text":"Solid tastes and very family oriented Indian cuisine.  
Dollar's to value is excellent. 
We will return."}
{"text":"Subtly flavored, expertly made. Better than the Indian food I've had in Manhattan and equal with that in Queens. Driving through the area, we found this restaurant and ordered carry-out. The mint sauce had a little extra kick to it; the samosas were light; my cauliflower was fresh and the seasoning had depth. Can't wait to be in the area again so we'll have an excuse to eat the lovely food, and this time we'll eat on the porch.The service was amiable. Excellent value. Glad to find high quality food in a quiet neighborhood."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian cuisine served up in a nondescript converted house off the main strips on Ile Perrot.  Like many restaurants of this type or category, you aren't going here for seductive ambiance, but rather the food (confirmed by the fact it does a brisk takeout business, at a 10% discount, to boot).  The menu is expansive but the offerings are all fairly unique in terms of seasoning, type to type - curries will be distinct from vindaloos which will be distinct from kormas, which is how it should be - and they will adjust the heat/spice level on any given dish to your preference.

Be sure to give their mulligatawny soup, channa somosa, and chicken tikka a try, as all are standouts and very good values for what you get.  I haven't really had a dud dish yet, so couple that with the overall affordable prices and quality of ingredients used, and that merits full marks in my book."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant, well priced for the portions you get with friendly service."}
{"text":"Although the decor is simple, this little gem makes amazing Indian food! My husband is Indian so he knows... our 2 yr old daughter loves the butter chicken (we ask for it mild for her and they accommodate ). Tonight we got a Thali, some pakoras, butter chicken and naan... so much food and so flavourful!! Definitely one of our favourite local spots!"}
{"text":"It's taken me 3 years to finally try this place, as we see people zipping in and out for take-out. I'd always pass by and was curious. 

Took my in-laws out and was surprised by the charm of this place. We parked at the school next door and walked over on a busy summer Sunday evening. The business is run by a small family, originally from Rajasthan, and seems to have a pretty tight ship. The interior is spacious and able to accommodate several large tables. In the summer, patio seating is available for smaller parties.

Service was warm and friendly. We had IPAs to start. Palak paneer, yum. Aloo gobi, yup. Everything was good. I couldn't comment on the shrimp platter but the in-laws wiped the plate clean. All pretty standard Northern Indian dishes here that are sure to please.

There were four of us total and the bill was $79. Reasonably priced and great food."}
{"text":"Amazing butter chicken, friendly and good staff. I have eaten the Samosas,Chilli Chicken,Chicken Curry, Fish pakora,Vegetable Pakora, Tandoori chicken leg,basmati rice,freshly hand made naan breads. The dipping sauce with samosas is a tamarind sauce and the other one is a green sauce very interesting herbal flavour and spice. As a chef i can tell its home made and made with love. I always go to \"Dev\" and when you pick up your food you get 10% off and i usually call in my order and when i get there its all nicely packages and ready in a box. Amazing place!"}
{"text":"À l'Ile Perrot, voici un excellent resto indien situé sur le Grand Boulevard. Les plats offerts ici respectent la tradition toute en saveur de l'Inde. Nous avons opté pour un poulet au beurre et un buf Madras, accompagnés de légumes mélangés, de riz basmati et, bien sûr, de pain nan. (Voir mes photos pour les couleurs). Le poulet était tendre et savoureux, mariné dans une belle sauce crémeuse. Le meilleur plat était de loin le buf Madras, préparé avec des cubes de viande mariné si tendres qu'ils se coupaient à la fourchette. Il s'agit d'un plat relativement relevé. D'ailleurs, une note au menu averti le client à ce sujet. Pour ma part, j'ai déjà connu du Madras plus piquant. Sur ce point, j'ai été légèrement déçu, mais le tout reste quand même balancé et délicieux.  

Le resto offre quelques sortes de bières, dont la Cobra India Pale Ale, brassées à Bromont qui accompagne parfaitement les plats relevés du Dev. Je vous la recommande 

Un conseil : Ne vous laisser pas décourager par l'apparence snackbar du resto. Il semble que c'est une philosophie chez les restaurateurs d'origine indienne et pakistanaise de ne pas mettre trop d'énergie et d'argent dans la décoration et l'ambiance Le Dev ne fait pas exception à la règle.  Ici, comme dans bien d'autres restos de ce genre dans le grand Montréal, tout est dans l'assiette."}
