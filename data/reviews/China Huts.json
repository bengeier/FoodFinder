{"text":"Love ordering food here! Their chicken chop suey is our favorite! We're always satisfied with whatever we order. I highly recommend this place! Yummy food!"}
{"text":"I don't think I'll go back to this restaurant anymore , ordered family dinner B  for pick up , when I got my order there were no appetizers, then I was told there is choice of the appetizers, you don't get all of them , that's not what they have on there menu . After discussing with the menu , they made decisions to give me 2 egg rolls and 4 shrimps ( cuz they don't have crab Rangoon) so I waited another 5 minutes just for my appetizers and I have to took my one year old inside of the restaurant from the car , seriously , the owner don't know what they are doing , they said they charged ownership, but come on , no matter what , you should know your menu well right ?and here is my lemon chicken and moo goo gai pan , I've never seen these before , oh , don't forget they put eggs with wonton soup"}
{"text":"We ordered almost $70 in food with the tip and after finding out they were out of crab Rangoon, butterfly shrimp and bbq pork, we altered our order. After finishing that, they called back to say they were out of sweet and sour pork! We altered our order again and waited. We've been eating here for a few years now and it's always been delicious! After our food arrived, I called back to see where our soy sauce and hot mustard was, I noticed that the complimentary soup they sent us was cold! That's when I realized there were NO fortune cookies! The lady on the phone said they were out! This is NOT right! They were out of everything and then tried to blame the chef for the poor meat choices the owner made! All of the meat was chewy and had a lot of gristle. Disgusting! I asked for half of my money back and the excuses started flying! I will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"The food was very fresh and the people were very nice and friendly... The Hong Kong chow mein wasn't my favorite but it's probably just a different style than I'm used to.... The fries rice wasnt fried enough but it was tasty and the sweet and sour pork was excellent... Oddly no soy sauce on the table, the cups were small and drinks o lyrics came in cans.. This would be a great take out place as well. It seemed to be a family place.. Ill be back for sure..."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. It looks like a hole in the wall place serving generic Chinese-American food, but they have a Sichuan menu and it's outstanding. I can't stop ordering the water boiled fish (I think it's called), which in Sichuan style comes in a hot pot style oily broth of chilies and peppercorn and it's always very good. (Not as good as from a place like Chengdu Taste, but at $13 is $10 cheaper...). My wife has ordered a couple other dishes, like a lo mein dish and something else from the Sichuan menu I forget what, but they were both very good and the portions are large. It has entered into our rotation of go-to restaurants."}
{"text":"So I went here on a whim on a Monday night... And it started off bad. They were out of chow fun... And string beans... Eggplant... On a Sunday night I might've understood this since alot of
Vendors do not deliver on Saturdays and Sundays but to be out on a Monday??? It was weird. 

But I gotta say that the service was decent. The lady was on the phone but she gave me a smile to acknowledge me and greeted me as soon as she was off the phone. And my food came out quick! I ordered it to go and I'm eating it while I write this review. Service 5/5 

Ambiance... It looks the same as it did when it was 3 other restaurants in this same location.  Still very clean and pictures of food on the wall. 5/5

Food was ok. I had to get the pad Thai since I was craving rice noodles and they were out of chow fun noodles. And every other Noodle dish they had besides pad Thai was egg noodles which I was not wanting to eat. The pad Thai was surprisingly decent... Was it a true pad Thai? No.. But it was cooked well and had a slight sour kick to it which tastes like lemon and not tamarind. The portion size was decent as well. I'm giving this dish a 4/5... Only because I asked for our extra spicy and they added in Serrano peppers to spice it up. I was afraid that they were going to overload it with Chinese hot oil but they did not. The Serrano peppers added a decent amount of heat and that is why I have it +1! :) And it came with a decent amount of chicken and 6 decently sized shrimp and lots of egg. 

The combo platter is something that I always like to get at Chinese restaurants just to be able to try most of their popular appetizers. It was decent. The egg rolls were very crispy but not much flavor. And the shrimp tempura tasted vet much like old grease. And though I could see the tiny amounts of shrimp in it...I could not taste the shrimp at all. The BBQ pork was very fatty but the flavor of the sauce was decent. The crab rangoons were good tho. And paper wrapped chicken just tasted like soy sauce. 2/5

For a quick bite... I'll probably be back. It wasn't the best Americanized Chinese food but neither was it the worst. And you gotta count in the convenience factor....:) it's literally walking distance from me.

So overall, I'm giving them 3 stars... The food was decent and the service was quick!"}
{"text":"Straight up and simple. The food was a 3 out of 5 (as of now, 1 dish tried). The service was 5 out of 5. So this place gets a 4 from me, for now.

I will not return for the same dish I ate (Hong Kong noodle). Butt! I will return because service was Friendly & to try a few other dishes. 

The menu is fairly large so I will need to try at least 3 or 4 more dishes. I'd love to give this place"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I have ever been tasted in Las Vegas  since I moved here, the shrimp was so delicious with the appropriated condiments, also the beef  was so exquisite I could not resist to come back again. Really recommend all the people come to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"New management and very nice people. They have a lot of different spicy food!!! Spicy food is my favorite food. I loved my food very much which I ordered there today."}
{"text":"The dish taste Excellent! Not very spicy, I can accept. It is savory. Good  customer service and environment. I will go again definitely."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here.  Food was delish! Delivery was fast.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for Chinese food and thought I'd try this place out since it's near to where I live. Staff was friendly and the place was decent. I ordered Mapo Tofu (pork and tofu) and it was pretty good... not the best but it satisfied the craving. Also ordered the spicy chicken wings .. again not the best and probably won't be ordering it again it was soggy and not much flavor. Lastly I ordered the chicken string beans in black been sauce ( PICTURED) and when I opened it I barely saw any chicken just a few SUPER TINY pieces ...they should rename it to just string beans in black bean sauce. Surprisingly the flavor was very good minus the fact that it was 99% string beans to 1% chicken. Lastly- they ran out of Chinese hot mustard!!! What Chinese restaurant runs out of hot mustard... smh"}
{"text":"I've ordered here previously always great food. Always order the same thing family special A. When I got the food it was cold and wasn't even edible. The hunan beef was chewy and bland. When I called back lady said new owner and so change recipe. Orange chicken, cold, chewy, bland. Chicken chow mein Bland. Suppose be spicy 7 not one chili flake in the whole thing. So when I called back there excuse new owner. So I highly recommend no need to waste your money here. There's a lot of other Asian places in the area that have same menu and will be way better."}
{"text":"Edit: Everyone deserves a second chance, and China Huts is super polite and their food is consistently good.

I really adored the Chinese restaurant that was here before this place. Their house special chicken was amazing and they were very clean. China Huts as it stands is very generic and doesn't have any dishes that stand out amongst the competition. The staff is very nice though. 

It's a shame that this place was shut down by the health department for over 20 demerits."}
{"text":"Veggie fried rice, veggie chow mein, and veggie egg rolls were so good! Fresh veggies with the perfect level of spice and not too greasy. I am so glad I found this restaurant. Delivery was quick and food was hot. Everything was perfect! Will be ordering here for Chinese in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp fried rice and veggie fried rice with crab rangoons and veggie egg rolls. Food was excellent and large portions for a reasonable price. Made fresh and pretty fast. We were able to add broccoli to both dishes at no charge. We also were given ice water and some wonton strips to munch on while we waited for our food."}
{"text":"The food of this restaurants is delicious,so I was order the shrimp chow noodles,it takes good :) And the services was nice too,I will defiantly come back!!"}
{"text":"This place is ok, new management so they dont accept the offer for free ragoon when u check in, no sweet and sour pork what a joke.. just giving it a try now maybe not coming back, doesnt know how to use chip?? lol lights are off maybe due to lunch only.. i dont know lol"}
{"text":"I good flavor, service was good. Definitely one of the better ones as far as fast food Chinese. Fair prices. Clean  restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is not recommended for a go back. For a dine in restaurant, they used foam places. I ordered from a lunch item and even though it was cheap, the flavor was not at all Chinese. Mongolian Beef was the worst I ever had. The meat didn't even taste like beef. The flavor was just too sweet... horrible, not worth going back."}
{"text":"This is probably my  favorite Chinese restaurant in the town! If you are  thinking where to eat asian food, this is the place u should choose. The  waitress is polite and quick . The  Chinese food that they serve, it is so delicious! Cant stopping have the whole food . I was told new owner  takes over the restaurant. But who care? The food taste is more important than everything! I recommend you to try China huts."}
{"text":"Blahhhhhhhhh. It's pretty dirty they have a B rating. I went and ordered the lunch special because that should be something you make and can't mess up. First I order the sweet n sour pork but the waiter said sorry were under new management they don't have it. Weird excuse but ok. I said sweet and sour chicken that we have. When I get the styrofoam plate of food first I try the fried rice not bad. But not cooked though lots of white rice in between the chunks of fried rice. Then I try the sweet and sour chicken now the first thing I notice is the ratio from chicken a other veggies was 90 other things 10 chicken. Ok whatever I use my dirty metal fork and it won't even penetrate the hard over fried chicken sweet and sour breaded section. Ok so I flick that one aside and try the next one my fork almost bent trying to stick it into so I'm 2 down and haven't even ate one. I do my best with the 3rd one and can only eat the softer half. By that time I only have 2 pieces left and I tried to eat what I could but I was left with a plate and I showed my waiter how am I supposed to eat this I can't even get my fork through it. So again he tells me sorry were under new management? WTH so I asked him how long have you been under new management and he stands there smiles and nods. I was like \"uhhhh\" ok whatever. Never again stay as far away from this nasty China hut as you can. Awful food and awful service. O yea I read the reviews and there is one review from 3 years back that said they were under new management.  How do these places stay in business so long!?"}
{"text":"We ordered the Chicken Chow Mein, the House Fried Rice and the Vegetable Egg Rolls. 

The Chicken Chow Mein was good, but very garlicky. When we ordered, they were out of white meat chicken, which I thought was odd considering it was Friday night. Prime time for takeout! The hostess did call me though to make sure that dark meat was ok, so kudos for the customer service!

The House Fried Rice was very tasty! Our favorite part of our takeout! The vegetable egg rolls were very good as well, we'd get both the egg rolls and the fried rice again!"}
