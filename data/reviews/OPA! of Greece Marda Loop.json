{"text":"Ever since this Opa! was renovated the service and food has been fantastic! I order my fries extra crispy and the staff have always done them to perfection without any hassle. Most Opa! Restaurants I go to have a lack of consistency associated, but this one recently has been bang-on every time. Hopefully they keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"OPA!! Have enjoyed OPA everywhere, to me it's my comfort food, when I doubt I get OPA, the chicken wrap with fries is my usual, but occasionally the Gyro wrap is great especially when you add the jalape√±o to it. But must be with fries, well I do like the Greek Salad too. And on a special craving, the Calamari is outstanding! With a lot of onions of course. The staff at this location are very friendly and good."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Greek food today and ever since I ate at Opa in the Market Mall, I settled for visiting this location in Marda Loop.  The place is quite large, with seating by the window and some tables in the back.  Nothing incredible special about the decor to mention, I just sat by the window so I could eat and watch the traffic go by.

I ordered a lamb pita with a Cesar Salad and a baklava, everything with a medium coke fell in around $12.  Staff today was preoccupied with some in house thing, so although they were serving me, they were distracted.

My meal was okay, but I found the lamb a little dry than the tender juicy morsels I had at the Market Mall location.  The salad was quite large and the baklava was stupendous."}
{"text":"This Greek food restaurant is delicious. Very healthy if compared with other fast food franchises. And everything is just great!. I can't wait to go back there!!.."}
