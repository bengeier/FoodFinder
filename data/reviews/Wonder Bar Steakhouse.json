{"text":"Just amazing.  The cowboy is the biggest and best steak I have had in Madison.  Cooked to perfection.  We had a sampling of appetizers and everything was just delicious.  Half of our group went with the seafood offerings and couldn't say enough about how great they were.
The restaurant has a really neat history and a lot of character.  It is expensive, but worth every penny.  Service is excellent and very professional.
I would also recommend this as a great place for a cocktail and appetizers."}
{"text":"First off, Luedtke's Wonder Bar is in the same location as the previous establishment known as \"The Bar Next Door\". The decor is much the same...but that is where the comparison ends. 

I will always prefer to spend my dollar at a small business vs. a chain. I respect what it takes to make good food and make it consistently when you are working from scratch every day. For reference, some of my favorite spots in Madison are Otto's, Louisianne's, and The Tornado Room. Luedtke's Wonder Bar is a notch above that dynamic trio if you can believe it. 

I have dined at Luedtke's Wonder Bar twice in the last two months. The latest meal being this last Friday night. I had seared tuna as an appetizer. The tuna was fantastic. The next thing I had was the crab bisque. I am not sure if this is on the menu every night but the two times I have been there, that has been the soup...Let me just say if it isn't on the menu every night, it should be! My goodness that is a great tasting soup. For my main dish I had a 9 oz fillet and garlic mash. The fillet had the consistency of sushi grade tuna. It was full of flavor and practically melted in my mouth. My only regret was that I didn't order the 12 oz! My wife had a crusted halibut fillet which she proclaimed was the best food she had ever had in a restaurant. That is high praise coming from her. 

So, the food is definitely 5 star, the atmosphere is quaint and cozy, the wine selection is nice and the prices are definitely in-line with what you get for the money. 

Hat's off Mr. Luedtke, we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal. I almost took a second filet mignon to go. A must eat in Madison!"}
{"text":"Our favorite steakhouse in Madison. We've been back several times - the steaks are to die for. The rest of the menu is pretty standard; surf'n'turf, lobster, shrimp, etc. Their drinks are solid - highly recommend \"The Godfather\" - and their wine selection is pretty decent. A small gem in a sea of steakhouses; my only real complaint is that more people are finding out about this place and it's becoming more difficult to get a seat on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a great steak house and the Wonder Bar NAILED it. Our food was exceptional and the service was top notch. We had the scallop appetizer, and both had steaks for our main entree. Everything was DELICIOUS. I also had the peanut butter dessert option = to die for. The price was steep, but worth it. The decor and the bathroom could use some updating, but the historical value made the imperfections easier to overlook. Go There!!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at the Wonder Bar with my companion and we wanted to share an entree.  The waitress didn't say anything about sharing when we ordered and I thought she was nice enough to bring us an extra plate.  When the check came, there was a $5 \"plate charge\".  What an unpleasant surprise... It costs $5 to have an empty plate?   I'm against this type of sneaky underhanded way to generate revenue.   I did not feel like ending my dinner with a complaint to the manager.  But needless to say, I will not return."}
{"text":"The Signature Steak is as good as it gets!!! Best Steak in town. The service was excellent considering they had a table of 30+ to deal with, but didn't look like they lost a step on the others."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoyed the atmosphere.  Service was as expected.  Food was good.  Steaks were a little under done.  I would come back just for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This has become one of our favorite places for steaks.  Unique ambiance is really special when seated by the roaring fire in winter.  I recommend the ribeye and the hash browns.  Drinks are made well and plenty strong."}
{"text":"Wow! This is the best steakhouse in Madison. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for. Nice wine selection, great steaks (go for the Cowboy) and bring your appetite. Four of us ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell, fresh and delicious. We also ordered the seared scallops, again delicious.  My wife ordered the surf&turf and loved it. Service was excellent, attentive but not intrusive. 

Overall we rated our dinner and the overall evening at The Wonder Bar a 5 star experience. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"My sisters and I really like Wunderbar BUT be sure you are NOT seated on the ground floor by the kitchen/waitstaff stn./restrooms!  Worst table in the place and the coldest, especially when you have to eat with your coat on!  Request a table on the second floor.
My sisters love the steaks and I love the crusted halibut filet but it wasn't available this evening. I was very disappointed. My petit filet was excellent but would have preferred the halibut!
Please put it on the regular menu."}
{"text":"One of the few excellent places in provincial Madison.  Bone in Rib-Eye is fabulous.  Apps are great.  You have to try pretty hard not to enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Here's the short of it:  Outstanding food with even better service, at a great value for the top-notch quality.  Highly, highly recommend.


I first started hitting this place before it was the Wonder Bar - at the time, it was the Bar Next Door.  The cozy ambience with a hint of historic edge, hit me.  Well that and the uber friendly clientele.  Fast forward a handful of years and it became the place I met my now husband.  Awwwwwww... 

Now initially, I was bummed when the Bar Next Door closed down.  That is, however, until I stepped in to the redone Wonder Bar.  Oh. My. Gawd.  They took the ambience of the old bar and shot it through the roof.  There isn't a bad seat in the house, either upstairs or down.  With a fireplace on each level, turrets and tasteful artwork, every corner is pleasing to the eye.  The tables are tastefully appointed.  Classy without being fussy.

When you arrive, start with a cocktail.  A nice selection of top shelf liquors line the back of the historic wooden bar.  And they make them strong.  Don't forget about the nice wine list for the winos - there's a lil' something for everyone.  Even if you're just thirsty and not hungry, this place is worth a stop in.  

The food is just... WOW.  Delectable steaks with good portions at decent prices.  The seafood and poultry dishes are also excellently prepared.  Thanks Chef Shawn!  Each dish comes with a salad and side, so you won't leave hungry.  Be sure to try the desserts, as they come in large-sized portions, perfect for sharing.  (their creme brulee is so, so good.)

Overall, this restaurant is better than other 'famous' steakhouses in the area, hands-down.  Just be sure to place a reservation - or you could be dining elsewhere that night.

So back to my story - I loved the place so much, I held my wedding upstairs.  Imagine that, a dining addict getting married in a restaurant - crazy, right?!  Lol.  Yeah, not so crazy when you see the intimate setting of this place.  The crew nailed the event with impeccable service and over-the-top-amazing food.  Every guest LOVED their selection and said it was the best wedding food they'd had.  Needless to say, this establishment holds a special place in my heart and I'll be back, time and time again."}
{"text":"The service was good, but the prices were pretty expensive. I ordered the $60 lobster tail and it tasted like nothing. Now, I know that the restaurant cannot control how flavorful the lobster is but if I let them know you would think they would help me out in some way. Compensation or an apology, but no, the manager said they couldn't do anything for me and walked away. Couldn't even take off $5 or something. We dropped almost $150 there and I felt pretty ripped off. We will never eat there again, and that's all I have to say about that."}
{"text":"Very intimate. We had been told that the steaks were amazing. I ordered my  steak medium.  It came out very rare.  I sent it back and it came back cooked nicely but they had poured butter all over it and the plate was full of butter. We were a party of 7 and no one else had butter on their steaks. My friend had broccoli and said it was very gritty like it hadn't been washed.  Appetizers were good. Service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Great steaks, terrific bar, very good value.  Not as pricey as Fleming's or Ruth's Chris and much better than Smokey's. The outside seating is not quite so charming with a not-so-great view of the air conditioning unit for the sports bar next door, but eat inside for a great, reasonably priced steak dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to the Wonder Bar two times. We cannot get over how tender and perfectly prepared the steak is. The atmosphere is quaint and charming. 
Highly recommend a date night to the Wonder Bar...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really, really want to like the Wonder Bar.  Bar area is cozy and they make a good cocktail.

The problem starts one you sit down for dinner.  The service (at least the last 3 times I went there) is marginal to poor, which is not what you expect when you are paying 30+ for a steak.  We ordered appetizers and once we finished the dirty plates sat on our table for 10+ minutes.  Finally we stacked them up and forced them on a passing waiter. Same with the salad/soup plates except no waiter passed so we had to juggle them once our entrees came.  You would think the waiter might check in at least once during the course or possible clear dirty dishes before you bring out a new course!  
Well a trip to the restroom taught me that the waiters hang out by the kitchen and talk to each other until orders come out.  Obviously no one is managing the place.
Food was good.  I had a filet and it was done perfectly (medium+).  The crab bisque was salty and it came out in an oversized bowl so it looks like there is not much in the serving.  I think the bowl was the reason for the lukewarm temp.
Sorry guys but I can recommend it for cocktails but not dinner.  I gave it 3 chances over the year or two it has been open and service is still (to be nice) severely lacking. There are lots of other places in town to get a good steak or seafood."}
{"text":"Man that is some good steak. Kansas City medium rare. Wife had bone in filet. Serious meat. Crab bisque flavorful but not much crab."}
{"text":"Review is just for bar! We didn't eat here, and not gonna lie, they don't have much for a vegan to eat.

We found this place when we were visiting Madison, and my husband simply typed \"bar\" into my Yelp app from our hotel room. We were both stunned to discover such a cool place so near to us! 

This is exactly the kind of place I like. Old school. Cozy. Classy. Older Clientele. If I lived in Madison, I would spend many of my nights in their tiny bar.

The bartender schooled me on what exactly goes on with a brandy Old Fashioned. Hey, I live in LA, where Old Fashioneds are made of bourbon, and no one ever asks how sweet you want it! But I rather liked my brandy version. I moved on to my signature drink, the Manhattan... and they wanted to maybe make that with brandy as well! What is up with you WI people and your brandy?!? :-D And while I admit I was taken aback that it was served on the rocks, well, I embraced that and celebrated cultural differences. :-)

Anyway, great spot! Great service! And as far as I am concerned, very cheap prices on drinks. We got 2 cocktails, 2 glasses of wine, and 1 glass of beer, which came to $40 with a generous tip. In LA, I would expect to pay over $60 for that!"}
{"text":"This place is probably the best value for a steakhouse in Madison.  If you are familiar with places like The Tornado Room, Smoky's, Johnny Delmonicos', etc. the Wonder Bar is on par with those, but probably 2/3 the price on average.  The steaks are phenomenal, the accompaniments are good, and the service is excellent.  Would recommend this place to anyone who wants a good steak."}
{"text":"I dunno. Not a steak person so I got the walleye. It was pretty boring, not a lot of flavor. Hash browns are pretty tasty though. My husband ordered the same dish as me and had twice as much fish on his plate. I think he liked his, because he ate all of it! 30 bucks for a tiny piece of bland deep fried fish, nope, don't think so. 

On the plus, our server was really nice and others at the table enjoyed their steaks quite a bit.

I really wanted to like this place ;("}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  The staff is so incredibly nice, the atmosphere is awesome.  It's very Wisconsin.  The food is amazing.  Good cocktails, good wine.  They have the best soup and crab cakes in Madison."}
{"text":"A great steakhouse with old school Italian charm. Known for steak and seafood, your meal will not disappoint. Had the crab bisque to start followed by the salmon special. Was an amazing meal and my husband enjoyed his sirloin and crab legs too. Overall a great choice for a night out in Madison."}
{"text":"We tried calling ahead on a recent Saturday night, the phone just kept ringing and ringing... I even facebook messaged them to see if there was a wait and how long it was, thinking they were swamped and maybe we would be better off to dine elsewhere.

Deciding to chance it, we arrived to a nearly empty lower dining area with no host, and no barkeeper. I finally flagged a waitress and she was quickly to seat us to a table. When I asked if their phone line was down, she replied that they were probably just busy and didn't hear it. I'd find that believable if there were customers to suggest otherwise.

Being somewhat of a regular here, the food is consistent. You order the steaks, and they arrive cooked to your liking and we rarely leave disappointed, or hungry. I appreciate the side salads that accompany the entree, as they are almost as big and filling as an entree on its own. The price point is not bad considering you get a warm bread basket, side salad, and a choice of side."}
{"text":"My wife and I had driven to Madison from the Twin Cities, originally to celebrate Mother's Day, but couldn't get reservations here due to Graduation celebrations also going on that weekend. So when we returned for Father's Day we were sure to book dinner reservations for Saturday as a combination Mother's Day make-good & Father's Day warm up, very much a win-win for everyone. 

The dinner, the atmosphere, our food and the service were all perfect. Our server, Cierra, couldn't have been nicer or better. My wife raved about her wine, a Malbec, and we both had the Wedge salads to start. My wife loved hers with Roquefort dressing and I had mine with blue cheese, also very good. For entrees we had Sea Bass and Shrimp, both delicious but I think next time we both agreed we'd both get the Shrimp. Prawns actually, they were unbelievably good. Thanks again to Cierra for the suggestion! Sides were just right as well, both equally delicious, the loaded baked and hashbrowns. 

We were too full for dessert but who doesn't love a good Creme Brulee or Cheesecake, perhaps to share... Maybe next time.

The atmosphere is what makes the Wonder Bar special, along with the people, the food and the history. You can't define it because there's nothing else quite like it. We just hope it keeps going the way it is and we're thankful for the experience."}
{"text":"I thought the food here was pretty good, solid but not outstanding. Very good martinis. Waitress was super friendly, but hey, this is Wisconsin. What I didn't understand were the prices. 

I cannot recount a single restaurant I've been to in my life where the prices were more out of line with what I was eating, the location, the building all that. At first I was like \"oh nice, this place is old school, it has character for sure. Food must be insane based on what they're charging.\" And it was all good, definitely not great. Definitely not memorable. $65 for a 22 oz ribeye?! That better be the best cooked cow I've had, because those are Mastro's prices, and definitely not Mastro's quality. I'm still unclear why I paid $100 for a steak and two drinks. Oh, and a wedge salad which had...French dressing. Huh? Not terrible, but what in the f. 

Anyhow, people are friendly ;)

Btw - changed from 3 to 4 stars because I realized everybody here was super friendly and I enjoyed the food, I was able to look at the menu ahead of time and know what I was paying so that should not detract a star."}
{"text":"The top steak in madison. Balances value better than rare steakhouse (also excellent) and the tomahawk steak is to die for. A very traditional feel in a building with a rich history that you'll hear all about. Must visit and you'll be back."}
{"text":"My only complaint about this place is no Don Julio tequila.  Food, drinks are on the money."}
{"text":"We wanted to go to a unique restaurant for New Year's Eve.  We found it! Small restaurant with a past rooted in the Mob of the 1930s,  when Chicago mobsters used to head North.  

They have a large wine list.  The filet almost melted in your mouth and the lobster side dish was awesome.  Baked walleye was delish.  The service was excellent.  One of the owners, Steve, stopped by our table to see if we were enjoying our meal.  We didn't have room for dessert, sadly.

NOTE:  This is a small restaurant.  Tables are almost all in close proximity to the door.   If you are going in the winter DRESS WARM. This would say is the only downside to the restaurant.   We were lucky and were able to move to the table by the fireplace.  Staff were most helpful.

The restaurant is closed on Sundays unfortunately.  A great find!"}
{"text":"What Happened to this restaurant?  New management?  This used to be our \"go to\" steak place when celebrating birthdays, holidays, anniversaries or just wanting to impress someone.  But, not any more.  The steaks have shrunk in size by at least 50%, and are now small, flavorless and tough.  The tasty Carpaccio is not on the menu any more, neither are they sauteed button mushrooms, which in my opinion, were THE best I've ever tasted!  Instead of those mushrooms, I was given a plate of long stringy Chinese type black mushrooms, which ruined the flavor and were very chewy.  The water glasses we filthy, as well as the table wear.  You don't EVEN want to know what was on the floor under our table!  It was not busy at all, and our waitress forgot my husbands dressing on his salad (french rocqueforte, she forgot the blue cheese crumbles).  Also, his \"medium rare\" steak was well done.  They used to have the largest size steaks, but not now.  For $65.00 each, we expected a large steak, and received extremely small ones.  Like I said, nothing like they used to be!  We mentioned about my husbands well done steak, and were given  2 \"free\" desserts, we'd rather have had our steak done right!  So disappointing!  We will NOT be back!  We will miss what this restaurant used to be, and are out to now find our new favorite steak place!"}
{"text":"If you want a great steak AND great service, then go to Delaney's. Wonder bar has the worst service I have seen in Madison (and they consider themselves fine dining).  Too bad because I was looking forward to eating here, but you folks lost my business."}
{"text":"Valentine's Day date night!  We arrived early for our reservation, and was seated right away.  I was slightly disappointed with our table because it was right by the hallway for the kitchen and I could hear the servers chatting and things clattering around.  Our waitress that night, Colleen, was phenomenal.  She checked on us just the right amount and kept the conversation light, friendly and funny.  Ask for her the next time you go!
I had the Merlot with dinner and my husband had Johnnie Walker Black on the rocks.  Both were generous pours.  Our meals came with \"warm\" bread--the bread was good, but not very warm.  The honey butter that came with made the bread better.  We started with the crab cakes.  Pricey, but delicious!  We both ordered the signature steak, which came with a side salad and side dish.  We both got the mixed greens, I got the twice baked potatoes and husband got the mashed potatoes.  The salad was good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the oil and vinegar dressing.  The twice baked was good, but the mashed potatoes were better.  Both our steaks were cooked the way we asked.  I was a little overwhelmed by the size of the steak.  It was 14 oz, and it was a tall cut of meat.  
We finished the meal with the creme brulee--one of the better ones in town that I've had!
I left the restaurant feeling VERY full, probably too full!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the Wonder Bar for the most part.  There have been times when I have stopped in without a reservation and they are so busy they hardly are able to greet you at the door to tell you it is a two hour wait.  So use common sense with that.  My most recent visit is why I want to review it today, it seems like the kitchen has improved.  The Cowboy steak I had was stunning.  Ordered \"Blue Rare\",  this steak was prepared to perfection.  Everything else, service, side dishes (included with the meal not at an extra cost) were fine but the star was that steak.  They really nailed it.  Of course the place has ambiance to spare, love or hate that, but it is a one of kind and unique for sure.  And it is even haunted.  Yep, no lie, look that one up.  Otherwise the bar is solid and great place to hang after or before a meal, friendly bar keeps and strong drinks.  It is a cozy place with a small parking lot but well worth the trip and worthy of the money they charge, great value for the dollar."}
{"text":"What started a bit rocky ended up a really nice experience here.  Yelp! (of course) led us to this place and I had to give it a go.  I made a reservation and there I went. 
The building is old and you'll get the story about the history and the alleged hauntings.  All well and good.  Dining area is really broken up due to the building, which isn't bad at all if you can handle feeling closed in.  
We came to try the steaks, so those were ordered.  The kitchen made an error on the order and both the server and manager were quite apologetic about it.  I'm very tolerant of mistakes.  They happen to everyone.  Not a big deal.  They handled it professionally.  
The food arrived and that's where this place overcame the error and earned it's five stars.  The steaks were cooked perfectly and were of great quality!  Yes, the pricing is a little high, but I never mind if I'm receiving a good, quality meal.  That is what happened!  
As recommended, I ordered the hash browns as the side.  These were perfect!  A little cheese and onions mixed in made for a great side.  I could order these things with every meal - forever.  
Overall a really nice place and a great meal.  That's what I was looking for and that's what I got!"}
{"text":"Amazing steak!!! I can say at this point of my life it was the best steak I have ever had. Nice quiet spot with great service and food. Highly recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"Wonder Bar was great! We came here for my Dad's 61st birthday. I called and made a reservation about a week out. The hostess who made the reservation seemed so excited that we had chosen there to dine for the celebration. 

They bring out bread and butter for a appetizer. There is either honey or cinnamon in the butter, makes for a sweet hint of flavor. Loved that. I had a green salad to start (very good!)...but i did share some of the lobster bisque going around the table, and it was amazing. Great choice. I would get some of that, if i went back.

My mom had the scallops, my dad (filet) and boyfriend (signature) had steak and i had the sea bass, from a recommendation from our waitress. All of us, TRULY enjoyed our meals. All would be great options to chose. 

For my dad's birthday, they offered us a free dessert but we got two :). Creme Brulee for my dad, and then the rest of us shared Peanut Butter cheesecake. So good. Yum Yum. Highly would recommend the cheesecake. 

Unfortunately, our waitress did not share the unique history of this establishment with us. If you have not already heard, this restaurants building is pretty historic, has mob ties and also is supposedly haunted. I was super disappointed that she did not include that in our experience. I had high hopes. Additionally, she was still very friendly and when we had her attention, attentive. However, i could never waive her down when she passed by, unless she made plans to stop and help us. 

I would say this would not be my first recommendation for a steak house in the area. If you have not been to Tornado, i would go there first. However, it was still enjoyable, and is nice that is a little out of the busy downtown area/has it's own parking."}
{"text":"I can't say enough wonderful things about this place! My husband surprised me with dinner here for our 1 year anniversary. When we arrived we were welcomed as soon as we walked in the door. They gave us the option of having a drink first or going to our table. We chose to have a drink and when we were ready they showed us to our table. The decor is very classy and charming. It is not a very large restaurant but there is additional seating up stairs which is very nice with two fireplaces. The service is very nice and everything comes out just at the right time. Wine list is wonderful and the food is excellent!! My husband had the ribeye while I had the stuffed trout. Good place for a group of no more then 8 I would say but very nice for a dinner with the person you love!"}
{"text":"I am torn between three or four stars....   I found too much fault with our experience to go higher.  I had looked forward to our visit for a few weeks and they didn't live up to my expectations.  First and foremost I was not impressed with the service we received.  We waited too long to be greated and were sat at the worst table even though the main floor was nearly empty.  The silver ware and glassware at our table was spotty and I could see a faint lipstick stain on my wine glass.  I also didn't feel our server was up to par for a high end restaurant, though she was mostly attentive to us I didn't receive regular refills of my beverage and had to ask to be refilled.  When the food arrived we were very impressed, even for the high price of the menu items I feel they were still a good value.  My wife had the fillet and scallops and our friends had lobster and fillet and a steak Oscar.  Their food looked terrific but I had an issue with my steak.  I had ordered it medium and it was somewhere between rare and medium rare, by the end of the meal my steak was cold.  The desserts were beyond terrific, it may have been the best cheesecake I have had in years.  Over all this is a mixed review because they didn't deliver when compared to Ruth's Chirs or Flemming's.  I don't mind paying for fine food but I want the complete package in all aspects of my dining experience."}
{"text":"Ate here to celebrate our anniversary. The food was delicious.  I had a fliet and husband New York strip.  Steaks were cooked perfectly and were very flavorful and tender.  They did run out of the wine we were drinking (only had 2 glass) so that was slightly disappointing, but the food and service more than made up for this.   We will definitely return here."}
{"text":"WOW what a disappointment! I have dined here several times and often recommended this restaurant for its steak. The last couple of times were not the best, but tonight 10/12/17 was the worst. Food came out at the wrong temperature twice and instead of correcting the situation, the manager tried to say what their definition of steak temperatures were different from other steak houses. Umn well it must be different from night to night because Inhad previously dined here and the steak came out at the appropriate temperature. He then tries to act like we wanted something for free... I'm on a business trip so my company pays for this, but I didnt even argue. Just paid the check and know that I will not be back. Quality, service and experience is just poor. I will go to Rare or the Tornado Room for my steak moving forward. They need to go out of business."}
{"text":"The staff was great but the food was just ok.   The steaks are fried so they lacking that rich flavor that you get from being grilled.   You also only get one side item.   When the meal shows up it kinda looks plain like its missing presentation value.  Also if you go there when its cold out you'll end up wishing you wore boots and two pairs of socks because the kitchen must keep an outside door open which creates a river of cold air in the dinning area adjacent it.  I'm not a picky person but I have to say I considered giving this place two stars.  Its expensive and even at half the price I will wouldn't recommend it.  Do yourself a favor and find another steak place."}
{"text":"Very overpriced for starters, but that would be fine if the food was worth it. Many of the patrons were drunk and loud, so have a feeling this is a place for rich lawyers to call home and throw their money at. That's fine, just not looking to throw $35 for a mediocre steak and have to deal with profane-laced loud conversations and hooting and hollering that belongs in a sports bar. Totally overrated."}
{"text":"We visited for our first time last night.  The crab bisque was Amazing!  The service was top notch.  Overall one of the best dinners we've had in Madison in a long time.  Finally an upscale restaurant doing it right."}
{"text":"I've lived in Madison my entire life, so the fact that I had not been to this establishment before last night is shocking to me. From the moment we made reservations, to when we were walking out after dinner, the staff was so incredibly friendly and attentive. 

We started out at the bar - which, is still the original bar from 1929 (with some refurbishing), where Al Capone and John Dillinger and some other gangsters used to hang out. 

We had \"The Godfather\" martini (vodka, pineapple juice) and the \"Tommy Gun\" (bourbon, cherry juice) - I recommend both.

We were seated upstairs for dinner. Our waitress told us a well-rehearsed history on the Wonder Bar, and added that it is now considered a certified haunted establishment! (This is a thumbs up in my book!) Our steaks were made perfectly, the salads and sides were just as good. Try the cheesy hash browns. Oh! And as an appetizer, get the crab cakes. 

The prices are decent for the amount and quality of food you receive. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant on a Thursday evening.  We had a reservation and were seated promptly.  Place wasn't full at 6pm.  Service was truly excellent and caring.  We had a nice bottle of wine with dinner.  Wine was a little expensive but not outrageous.  Food was very good overall; well maybe all but the dinner bread.  Kind of uninspiring.  Steak was cooked as ordered.  Crab cakes appetizer was also good.  I would probably visit again when looking for a steak and my wallet is full."}
{"text":"Very good food. I got the st Louis steak. Now I wasn't expecting how huge this cut of steak was going to be. It was one of the best steaks I have ever had. The wedge salad substitute for blue cheese was very very good and large too. The hasbrowns were a good side item to get as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried out the Wonder Bar last night because we had a $10 off coupon. We had a 6:30 reservation and were promptly seated upstairs, which we appreciated because the bar, although a cool atmosphere, was loud and wasn't quite the \"date night\" we had in mind.

Service was ok, but we expected better at these prices. You can't eat here for less than $25 a person -- average is more like $30-35 each. My husband's wine glass had a lip print on it so he had to ask for a new one, and the server never brought me my side order. We also felt a bit rushed through the salad course -- I wasn't even finished with my salad when our food came out and there was very little space on our small table for me to slide it over.

That being said, the food was pretty good. I loved the iceberg wedge salad and could not get enough of the dressing they put on top (French with blue cheese crumbles and real bacon bits). The scallop entree was delicious and very generous (seven scallops with lots of pasta, yummy sauce).  On the other hand, my husband ordered the crab bisque and we both found it extremely salty. He did enjoy his salmon. 

Overall, we judged it to be a decent place but overpriced for the service and quality of food."}
{"text":"After twenty years of study, this place has the best dining in Madison. I had the Kansas Strip, and my wife had a filet. Both were done to perfection. Salids were fantastic. And don't forget, you must have the hashbrowns. I want to go back for more."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Manager is a dick though. Not pleased with how he treated two women in our party of five... Once dude (I won't name names..R-¢¥) learns some manners, maybe I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to enjoying a meal at Luedtke's Wonder Bar since I was there this fall for a cocktail with a group of friends who get together to go out to eat several times a year. We are usually looking for something of an adventure and included the Wonder Bar at the last minute, but only for a cocktail - more or less to confirm rumors that the painting that used to hang over the fireplace was back. As soon as we arrived, I wished we had chosen the Wonder Bar for our main destination - vowing to come again soon for dinner. 

The ambiance had me immediately - the intimate bar area, the turret rooms for privacy, the incredible stone fire place with, yes, the famed charming painting of a 60's era pinup beauty back in place. Every place that my eye rested registered satisfaction and perfection in my mind. We ordered cocktails - I felt compelled to go with something supper club - esque and ordered a brandy old fashioned - which, besides being perfectly mixed, complimented the atmosphere so that I felt like we were sitting there during the heyday of the supper club era. All too soon my first visit to the Wonder Bar ended - without so much as a taste from the menu. 

Finally - my husband and I returned for dinner last night with his parents and our young daughter to celebrate his birthday. Upon our arrival, everything was just as I remembered - but, I think possibly even more magical. My husband ordered his favorite martini and I chose something bubbly - neither disappointed - in fact, my husband's blue cheese stuffed olives were promptly accommodated (a rarity in this land of cheese for some unfathomable reason). 

After the rest of our group arrived and settled in with a cocktail, we were led upstairs to a turret room for dinner. It couldn't have been more perfect for our group - cozy and quiet. We ordered a few side dishes for our daughter to keep her comfortable (they were brought out within a matter of minutes) and some oysters on the half shell for the rest of the table. Within moments we were enjoying those lovely little briny treats while contemplating dinner choices. Our server advised us of the dinner special - a salmon filet, Oscar style - sounded delicious except that we had just had salmon at home the night before. We all settled on steak (probably not that surprising as it is a supper club), but, what was surprising to me was the range of sizes and cuts - something for everyone. Finally, a 6 oz tenderloin - the perfect size. 

The salad choices were consistent with the usual supper club fare - but that is not to say they were boring. Our table ordered one of just about every side salad on the menu - and we all raved that our choice was the best. 

Our steaks arrived unanimously perfectly cooked to the correct temperature, with that perfect amount of crust - my mouth is still watering remembering it. We ordered a range of side dishes - potatoes and vegetables - all exceeding our expectations in flavor and portion size (though not so grossly oversized that you leave feeling like your leftovers could feed an army). 

Since it was my husband's birthday, I wanted to end our dining experience with a birthday cake. I didn't wish to bring something in - seemed unfair to the Wonder Bar. So, a few days ahead of our reservation I asked whether one of their deserts could be made as a whole cake rather than separate pieces - just seemed more special. Of course they were more than happy to accommodate - so, after dinner and perfectly on cue, the server brought out a delicious chocolate torte covered with berries - and with a few birthday candles to boot! The presentation was an excellent surprise - the cake was divine. I'm looking forward to a little sliver tonight when I get home. 

In all, our experience at the Wonder Bar left absolutely nothing to be desired. Frankly, as far as steak houses/supper clubs go, Luedtke's Wonder Bar is my new favorite. I believe I might have actually enjoyed it better than Gibson's in Chicago which has been my No. 1 since I first went there about 10 years ago. 

Pros: Ambiance, service, food, local flair, historical relevance, price. 
Cons: None (ok, to tell the truth, my husband would like it better if his steak would have come out on a sizzler plate). 

Quote of the Night (from my 6 year old): \"My meal was better than anything I could have gotten off a kid's menu.\" (This has significance given the fit she had when she found out they didn't have one.)"}
{"text":"We tried the Wonder Bar last Friday night. We'd made reservations but it really wasn't that busy. We were warmly greeted when we arrived. The downstairs where you enter seems intimate and cozy. It has a bar and a few tables. As they ushered us up the stairs to our table, I was concerned as the temperature in the stairwell seemed overly warm but it was nice and cool once we got upstairs. The upstairs is open w/many tables. It does show some wear and tear.

Our server was friendly, courteous, and entertaining. When she learned it was our first visit there she told us some of the history of the restaurant and shared that it is supposedly haunted. I admit I looked over my shoulder a couple of times hoping to see a ghost.

The prices at Wonder Bar are not inexpensive. However, the portions were large and everything was well prepared. My sirloin was HUGE and perfectly cooked. Twice-baked potatoes were delicious. The rolls and herb butter were amazing and she brought us a refill. The oysters were delicious and one of the more reasonably priced items. I was somewhat disappointed in the crab bisque. Our server had talked it up, but the flavor was overwhelmingly tomato soup versus crab bisque. The surf and turf combo was tasty and large but we should have asked what market price was as $85 seemed rather high.

In all it was a fun experience with great service and good food. I definitely want to hear more about the ghosts. The price-point means it will be reserved for special occasions for us."}
{"text":"This place made a bad day turn out great. I walked in from a cold, dark, and windy Wisconsin winter and was promptly seated next to their fireplace.  Instantly I felt much better.  After a glass of wine, a very pleasant server was kind enough to offer suggestions for the menu.  Atmosphere is relaxing and the food was delicious.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow. This little restaurant serves delicious food without question. I checked this place out with my Aunt who had been there before. She recommended we go with Carpaccio for the appetizer because it will 'melt in your mouth.' Well, that it certainly did, but I don't know if I could get a distinct taste from it. I enjoyed it, and made it into a mini open sandwich with the piece of bread, parmesian, and salad it was served with. It grew on me more and more after each bite, it was also quite an elegant cut, very thinly sliced.

I also had the Loaded Wedge salad, this was the most confusing dish to me. It was literally a wedge of salad. If you wanted an easy go at it, you needed to cut it up prior to trying to eat it. For the entree, I went with the Filet Mignon. That too 'melted' in my mouth. I have never had a piece of meat executed so well. It was so easy to cut and filled with so much flavor (juicy too). For my side, I tried the Wonder Bar Signature Hashbrowns. The only thing I had to compare it with was George Webbs hashbrowns, which in hindsight, makes me laugh now. These blew those out of the water. This is a must order side for anyone.

Best part of the meal was that I left full. My biggest worry about restaurants like this is that the portions are smaller, which if they have great dessert options, good. But usually, you're not interested in a dessert as well.

Dear Wonder Bar,

While I doubt to visit often, I do know that I will have to come back again and I will tell my friends about the 'wonder-full' time I had.

Sincerely,

You're new fan

p.s. I heard The Wonder Bar is haunted, I will have to explore that more the next time I visit."}
{"text":"If you ever go to the Wonder Bar, take my advice and PAY IN CASH. 

Five of us went there for dinner last Tuesday. We were 3 minutes late getting there and they promptly gave our table away. So, we patiently waited about 45 minutes for another table. 

The food was good: we all had the petite filet. It was a good value at $26. Mine came with a somewhat wilted and small salad and a side. My total bill was $40 (including a glass of wine and tip). The waitress was very nice and offered to split up the bill for us, and we all paid our share (about $40 each) and went on our way. 

Three days later I checked my credit card activity to find a $169 charge on it from the Wonder Bar (aka Coliseum Bar). I alerted my friends who told me they had already been charged the correct amounts on their cards. I contacted the Wonder Bar, and Rick the manager double checked and informed me they had put the entire bill on my credit card, and that they would correct it on my card and charge the others in my party. I informed him my friends had already been charged their correct share. He apparently didn't listen b/c today several of them were charged AGAIN. 

So, what had been a semi-nice experience has turned into a huge headache. This was an awful customer experience, and I don't think any of have received an apology for all these errors. There goes your positive review, recommendation, and any repeat business from us."}
{"text":"Boo.  I have been to The Tornado room quite a few times as well as many other Wisconsin steak places so that guided my expectations going in.  Had heard great things, many said this place was better than Tornado.

But it was not.  It was significantly worse.  Service was just fine, quick and polite.  But the food was very standard steakhouse stuff at a price as high as the best places in town. 

Our drinks were hit and miss, good Manhattan, competently incompetent Gimlet.  It was not even cold, did not seem to have been shaken, just some gin with lime in it.

We noted the shrimp cocktail was outrageously priced but thought maybe they would be some really impressive shrimp.  They were pretty average size, only 4 of them, and there was no horseradish and they had zero flavor themselves.  Worth 4 bucks maybe, we spent 20 on it.

The wedge salad was not a wedge.  it was a thin slice of iceburg with an enormous amount of dressing that tasted like sugar and oil and nothing else.  I am not super into wedge but my wife loves it and she said this sucked as well.

There were rolls.  Two to be exact.  They were like brown and serve whitebread, flavorless wads of dough from the grocery store.  Compared to the bread sampler at Tornado you get it was a big bummer.  Also, no veg garnish to snack on.

So up till now it had been disappointing but the whole time we were hoping the steaks would be the star of the show and pull this one out.  My wife got the house special and I got the cowboy streak, similar to the bone in ribeye I have gotten many times at Tornado and make at home.  We both ordered them medium rare, which is usually a safe bet for well seared on the outside, hot pink insides with somewhat rendered fat.  You know, a good steak.

What I got was full on rare in parts, bloody and cold inside without much sear.  The connective tissue and fat around the rib eye was completely un-rendered and gross.  The main part was better prepared but the meat was not seasoned very much, standard bland steakhouse steak.  The steak was large but that was the only thing going for it.  My wifes filet was also 80% cold and uncooked and not very flavorful.

We did like the hash browns though.  If you want a place to go and have a drink and eat a hash brown you should definitely consider the Wonder Bar.  If you want a great steak, or just a fine dining experience where you don't feel like you were ripped off there are so many places in Madison that will serve you better:  Pig in a Fur Coat, Tornado Room, Muramoto, Lombardinos and many others that are considerably less expensive but offer much better food."}
{"text":"This place has been a Madison favorite of mine, for years. I can't believe I haven't written a review yet! 

If you're going to eat here, you MUST do two things. 
1.) Get a table downstairs near the fireplace. I suggest reserving the table directly in-front of the fireplace. 
3.) Come hungry.

The staff is great and the food is generally perfect. 
It's the perfect spot for an anniversary dinner or any romantic setup."}
{"text":"This is a great place for steaks. I had a filet mignon and my son had the Kansas City strip. Both had a lovely crust. My son ordered his with caramelized onions. For sides, we ordered the hash browns and asparagus. the hash browns are along the best I have had. This place has a very interesting history too. Thanks for a lovely evening!"}
{"text":"I had to send my steak back twice only for it to come back still medium versus medium well. Emily the server lack zest and the desire to please. When I addressed the steak temperature still incorrect...she offered to recook for the the 3rd time and asked if I wanted it compensated. The baked potatoe was overcooked and appeared to be sitting all day. Considering it was 830pm I kept the steak partly because I had waited long enough and hungry...go figure. Steve the manager came over to explain why the steak was medium well and blood red. Pitifully inadequate service....very disappointing. Steve asked how he could enhance my dining experience ...I said your waitress mentioned comping the steak....he became very uncomfortable. They tried a free dessert...no thanks. Ultimately Steve credited the shrimp. There was a table that was EXTREMELY loud and roudy.....just an overall POOR dining experience. Never again!!"}
{"text":"Best meal we have had in Madison in a while. Went last night. Seated at once in their upstairs dining room. Very attentive service. Food was VG. Our party had cowboy steak,Chicago pork chop,petite filet and another steak. More food than you can really eat,unless you skip meals for the rest of the day. With crab cake appetizer,four dinners, 5 drinks and tip we were still under $200.00. We will go again and would recommend to others if they want a great steak in Madison."}
{"text":"We have heard wonderful things about this place and have had great experiences in the past BUT last night was an exception! 
The ambience & wine was lovely but everything wise was subpar. I was looking forward to yummy food there all week and it was a HUGE disappointment. The bread was mushy and the butter was hard as a stone.  The wedge salads were drowning in dressing and the tomatoes were tasteless.  The carpaccio was frozen and covered with a Caesar salad, very strange. The \"Signature  Crab Cakes\" were mushy and the \"Housemade remoulade\" was tartar sauce.  VERY disappointed! The service was slow and not great. .."}
{"text":"My wife and I use Yelp constantly, but more for reading reviews rather than posting them. After our most recent visit here, I felt compelled to share our experience. My wife and I decided on this place after hearing numerous good things from friends, as well as reading good things on Yelp and Trip Advisor. Boy, I'm not sure what restaurant all those folks went to, but it sure wasn't this one.

Upon arrival, you will notice that the parking lot is extremely small, which was fine as we were one of only a handful of cars there. When we walked inside, we were met by a very friendly gentleman who showed us to our table. We were located on the main floor, and unable to see the upstairs or downstairs that we have read about in other reviews. Our waitress was very friendly and knew all the specials without fail. We ordered some drinks and decided to peruse the menu a bit longer.

While waiting for our drinks to arrive we analyzed the décor. I have to say, it is nothing more then subpar. The main offenses were that the ceiling tiles were bowed/warped and falling off the ceiling. The floor was extremely dirty and worn. Not dirty from food or anything the staff could alleviate, just from age. Overall it is extremely outdated.

My wife decided to order the filet (topped with mushrooms) along with the signature hash browns. I ordered the signature New York strip with a side of Broccoli Hollandaise. We began with the signature crab cakes.

The crab cakes were decent, but nothing spectacular. The Remoulade sauce that the crab cakes came with was very tasty. We also received side salads which were nothing more then plain spinach on a plates with a few veggies on top. Easily something you could have made yourself at home.

The real shame was with the main course itself. To start, the signature hash browns (with onions) were very bland. The broccoli was undercooked and the sauce, while decent, still had the shape of the piping bag it was piped from. My wife's filet was solid, but slightly overcooked. She said it was just \"alright.\" My strip was the real dud of the meal. I ordered it medium rare, but found out that is not how it was cooked when cutting through the middle. Not only was the middle the rarest of rare, it was ice cold; not room temperature, ice cold. To this I have to ask: why is a place dedicated to steak cooking a steak from an ice box/refrigerator? Meat is supposed to be room temperature when you begin to cook it, is it not? What a let down.

Overall, this place was not \"bad,\" but it was sorely disappointing based on all the positive things people told us about it."}
{"text":"Dined here the other night with my family for my brother's birthday. They were able to host a party of 8, including a baby, with no problems and they were delightfully helpful. The food was exquisite and the drinks strong. The waitstaff was kind and patient, and the host even came over to compliment my one year old's behavior. They thanked us for choosing their establishment, and we left full and satisfied! The history behind this restaurant is fun and exciting, and the ambiance is classy, yet relaxing."}
{"text":"I called ahead and made a reservation. When i get there I am immediately greeted by the server. She sits me down and I wait about 10-15 minutes without anything to drink nor a menu. I finally lean towards the server and ask \"do you have a menu?\" She says \"oh yeah am sorry\" she brings me the menu and ask if I would like anything to drink. I order water and it comes out. I ask for a straw and never get it. It's now 30-40 minutes and i am ready to order. The waiter bypasses me to take the order for a couple who was seated after me. Now i look around and realize, i am the only hispanic well am the only what the world would call \"minority\" wow... I got up and left. You can't have my business treating me like that. Their restaurant has a very pricey menu therefore I will like to be treated very well. Never ever going back!"}
{"text":"My parents took me to this place 50+ years ago [they had nickel slots in the back room,,].Decided to return when it became the Wonder Bar again.This place is intimate/romantic complete with fireplace,a great place for a date or that special night.Both myself and companion had the petite filet which was excellent. Suggest bisque and hash browns[ with cheese/onions] as sides.Service was attentive friendly and very good.Recommend giving the Wonder Bar with its food and history a try!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Madison. The filet is fantastic. Great service. Great atmosphere. Great food. The triple threat..."}
{"text":"We had reservations for Thursday night and when we walked in, the place was quite busy. Hungry for steaks and hearing great reviews about the place, we stood by the front door eager to be seated.

Tick tock. Tick tock.

The bartender took a quick glance at us and said we'll be seated in a minute.

\"In a minute\" turned into never.

Two servers walked by and made eye contact with us and didn't acknowledge that we hadn't been helped. We were the only two standing by the front door, so we weren't hard to miss.

After 10 minutes of standing there and looking around the room for SOME kind of help, we were fed up and decided to leave.

First impressions are very important, Wonder Bar. Sadly, you failed."}
{"text":"We waited 25 min before someone cane to our table.  Food was good and they acknowledged that we did not get good service.  Free drinks and dessert but still the experience was not good."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place.  The story behind it is cool, the nostalgia box was checked, and the bar area was kitschy.   The margarita was very basic- not bad but not good.

Then upstairs to the dining room- really run down and not inviting.  We started with the oysters Rockefeller which might have been good if they didn't contain half the sand from the beach.  Shame.  And the wedge salad cake with French dressing.  Wait, what???  Never before have I seen that and hopefully not again.  The bone-in filet was good.   Prob the only thing I enjoyed.  The asparagus also had sand/dirt....please rinse!!  I will opt for tornado!"}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent food, we had Chilean Sea Bass and Kansas City steak with pasta alfredo and marinara.  

The bar has the original name from when it was a gangland hangout with characters like Capone and his henchmen frequenting the place when it was a little too hot in Chicago.  The place is pretty much original along with the round corner eating areas so nobody had a back to the door.  The original escape tunnel to lake has been cemented over and gunfire was not an unknown quantity here.

Service was superb.

Had a great conversation with the Manager."}
{"text":"This was a pretty delicious steakhouse. Super cool ambiance because of the history of the establishment and the building it self. I ordered the Sirloin steak medium rare and it was beautiful. My friend also ordered the Cowboy Steak Oscar style and it was epic. I will say that the service wasn't the best as we had reservations at 8:45 but they didn't have a table ready until 9:10. Not that big of a deal since the food was so good!"}
{"text":"For the money, this place is an great value.  It has a nice old school charm and they make the best martinis! Martinis are $9.50 and beers were $5.00.

Unlike many higher end steak houses, Wonder Bar's steaks come with your choice of one of three salads (Warm Bacon Spinach salad, Wedge Salad with French Roquefort, or House Salad with house made oil and vinegar dressing) and a side.  I had the Asparagus Hollandaise and my dinner partner had the double baked potato.  The asparagus was a little small, but really, I'm there for the steak so I didn't mind.

I ordered the Cowboy Steak (rib eye) and my husband had the Wonder Bar Signature.  I also added mushrooms.  I love a place that gives you the option of \"Blue Rare.\"  The steaks did not disappoint.  They were huge (seemed larger than even the portions described), cooked perfectly, and nicely flavored.  

Because it's by the Alliant Convention complex it's busy.  The tables are four tops but with all the food you get and drinks, four would seem a bit cramped.

Will definitely come back when we come through Madison again."}
{"text":"This is the second time visiting wonder bar, and probably our last. It was fine, but a little underwhelming. The service was good.Steaks were just OK, soup lacked flavor, Shrimp and salad's we're good.The breadbasket was terrible."}
{"text":"Started with the oyster Rockefeller. Wasn't a bad choice. Ordered the filet as my main course, along with the hash browns.  The filet was the best part of the meal. Cooked well and tasted great. The hash browns were nothing special, but still tasted good. The Manhattans were good and strong and our waitress really knew her drinks. Didn't knock my socks off, but for the price, it was well worth it."}
{"text":"It's a rare to go to a traditional style steak house and have the older men as hosts and young women as the servers. I was excited to see a seasoned man greet us and was hoping that would be a good sign for great service to come. I would feel the same if I saw an older woman btw. Instead we had a young woman who giggled out the specials, slacked on drink delivery and simple clearing of dishes. It may seem like I'm nitpicking but when you are spending 32 - 50 bucks on your entrees alone, I expect concise service. Also the large tray service is just stupid for a two top in a small dining room with a support beam positioned in the middle of the small dining room. It seems a bit pretentious and unnecessarily forcing the servers to work harder than necessary. I could go on and on, basically they need a new trainer or training system. 
     I enjoyed my crab bisque. The oysters Rockefeller were a sure sign that we are in WI. Way overdressed with way too much cheese which led to never tasting the oyster. (If there was Pernod, we didn't taste it). The wedge was perfect. My spinach salad was disappointing, I expected the warm bacon vinaigrette to actually have bacon in it, or a nice chunk or two on the salad itself. My crab legs were perfect and delicious. My twice baked potato was quadruple baked at least, aka: dead. My dates cowboy was under cooked but the flavor was great. 
     I expected more from The Wonder Bar considering the rich history of the place, and also considering the prices. I may go again but perhaps sit in the bar and split things with a friend."}
{"text":"My disappointment with this experience is one I don't find often. I'm hoping it was an off night for them but for the cost of the visit I expect much better. For starters, our service was slow and nobody even offered to tell us the story of the history of the restaurant. Seeing past that, I ordered a dirty martini...not hard to make. It came out missing the dirty...which then took me 20 minutes to get a waitress so I could get some olive juice. 

Then we get to dinner....I was excited for the lobster bisque since so many people rave about it. Unfortunately it lacked flavor and I was far from impressed. We had a group of 8 and 4 of us got the filet with king crab legs, more like leg.  Of the 4 of us, 3 ordered medium rare and one ordered medium. Considering they put the temperature chart on the menu there was no consistency in the doneness. My medium rare steak was more like medium well. Honestly, I can cook a way better steak at home for a fraction of the cost. And finally, the side of asparagus was 5 tiny little Spears that shouldn't even count as a side. 

Personally, I won't be back and I would recommend having a nice dinner and spending your money somewhere with more consistency. That way you know your hard earned money will be spent on something you'll thoroughly enjoy."}
{"text":"What a Great find during the Dairy expo!  Food was amazing and Steve the manager couldn't have been more accommodating!  Don't miss the scallops!  Can't go wrong with a steak..  with a dirty martini   Enjoyed it so much went twice!!  Thank you.."}
{"text":"Had dinner reservations at 5:00 12/27/2016. Walk in and ignore by all staff members. When Rick came by acted like total a ASS. Took us up stairs with out a word and left. Dinner was ok. I ask the waitress if Rick was in a pissy mood and said yes. We've been going to the wonder bar for sometime not sure if I'll go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. I really did. 

Madison has so many good steakhouses, and I was hoping this would be able to break into my normal rotation. However, the meal was just mediocre. 

We had two appetizers, the bbq prawns and the stuffed mushrooms. The mushrooms lacked flavor. The prawns were good size and had a good flavor. I would recommend those as a good option. 

I ordered the ribeye, which is my favorite cut and what I get everywhere I go. My fiance ordered the filet. Both were cooked very well, but the flavor was just missing something. It lacked the melt-in-your-mouth, ohmyfreakinggod experience of Delaney's or Tornado. Overall both steaks were adequate.

For sides, definitely go with the hashbrowns, they were far and away the highlight of the meal. double baked potato was bland. 

Price is one thing this place has going for it, because their steaks come with a soup or salad and side dish included.  

Overall, I find it hard to say I will ever come back to this place with so many great steak options in Madison. Just didn't do enough to put it in the same discussion with the best this city has to offer."}
{"text":"If I could give this 5 stars for the steak and 0 stars for the atmosphere I'd do that, but I can't so I'll split the difference, even though you can't really divide by zero in a case like this.

First visit was on my birthday, my friends and I ate downstairs at 6 on a Saturday and the place was busy, but quiet, the food was awesome and the waitstaff very nice.  I ordered a special aged prime rib and it was fork tender and delicious, and they even brought me Bearnaise sauce (even though that is not traditionally served with prime rib) without a weird look.

Chose to come again for a second event a few months later.  That time we were seated upstairs and wound up next to an extended table of guests who clearly had a huge bar tab running and were getting louder and more obnoxious with each course.  We asked the server if we could move or he/manager could ask them to tone it down a bit but no luck with either, so we got some to-go bags and took most of the food home where we could eat in peace.  

Hoping that this was an isolated event,  we came back for a third trip and asked to be put in the \"quietest\" part of the restaurant.  We were led upstairs and put into an alcove.   The restaurant itself was quiet, we were there ahead of the bar crowd, this was also 5:30-6:00 or so on a weekday, but the alcove had audio speakers mounted in the ceiling above us and whatever generically bad \"music\" was coming through them seemed to be turned up to 11.  We asked the server to get them turned off or turned down to no avail, we then asked again and it got turned to 10.5. because, as it was explained to us, the \"music\" is for everyone and everyone must be able to hear it over the increasingly raucous bar crowd that was assembling.

My dinner companion actually reached up to see if the wires could be disconnected but they were hidden, so he wrapped my ski jacket around the speakers and that muffled it to about 8.5.  That appeared to get the manager's attention because they rushed over with a concerned look and asked us why there was a jacket hanging from the ceiling.  We explained that the \"music\" was overwhelming us and it was either them turning it down or us leaving the jacket floating up there like that.  The \"music\" got turned to 6, at best, and we ate our meal, (which was not as good as the first time) quickly and then left.

So my 2 star recommendation to diners is this:  If you want a good expensive steak and don't mind a loud atmosphere, check this place out."}
{"text":"A classic steakhouse and supper club combo located in a small historic house that they claim was a hangout for Chicago gangsters back in the 1930s.

We made reservations for a celebration dinner on Friday night of graduation weekend, there were 7 of us dining at 8 pm.

Most of the seating is upstairs and there were several large groups like us.  Service was pretty good although I felt a bit sorry for the wait staff who had to climb the back stairs with full trays all evening (kitchen is on lower level).  

Despite the gangster folklore, visually this place isn't anything special inside but they make up for their lack of ambiance with the quality and presentation of the food.  Almost everyone at our table got a steak -perfectly prepared-and one ordered shrimp (and was disappointed).  Your meal comes with choice of potatoes (recommend the hash browns) or vegetables and soup or salad (get the classic wedge).

They have a decent wine list and the markups aren't too aggressive (I got a Caymus cab for about $100-retail price typically around $75).

Bottom line, great steaks, nice service in a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had an amazing late dinner on a Monday night. Monday is a slower night so it was very quiet and intimate. I had the filet with hollandaise and twice baked potato. It was amazing! So much flavor and the sauce was perfect. Our server, Coco, was fun and friendly even though we kept her there a half hour late. My boyfriend got the signature steak which was also incredible. The bartender made a great martini also! It was a great time and the place has a cool history which made it even more fun. Highly recommended if you got a little extra money to spend, loved it all!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. I love that they not only take reservations, but allow you to reserve either of the two turrets for a more private dining experience. Our family has reserved a turret on 4 different occasions and have always been obliged. 

The service has always been fantastic. The servers are friendly and outgoing and do their best to make sure your experience is perfect.

The menu itself is pretty much exclusively steak and seafood. They took the Chilean Sea bass off the menu which is kind of a huge bummer to me. I loved that dish and I'm a pesketarian, so a good fish dish is always a good find. Despite my disappointment for the lack of sea bass, I was pleasantly surprised by the other fish options. I ended up choosing the pan seared scallops which are served with penne pasta in a cream sauce. It was delicious and definitely ended my sadness over the lost sea bass. My husband always gets the signature wonder bar steak and he absolutely loves it! The steak is cut SO thick and is definitely worth the price tag.

They let you choose between several different salads and sides to accompany your meal. The salads aren't just your run of the mill salads either. They have delicious wedge salad and also one that has a signature bacon dressing.. And I believe one other one as well. The sides are also plentiful, more than just potatoes served different ways (although they do have lots of potatoes.. Lots of different ways.. And all are delicious..)

I have also had all three desserts that are offered and the cheesecake in particular is the best I've ever had! Yum.

Save Wonder bar for a special night, reserve a turret and prepare to be very happy and very full."}
{"text":"Very cool restaurant at the edge of town. They were very accommodating as my wife wanted something not on the menu, but used to be. They were able to make her something similar. Food was good, not NYC good but generally good."}
{"text":"Lots of good things about this place. First one, its haunted by gangsters. That is hard to beat. Second, it has really good steaks. Third, if its your birthday you get a free dessert. And not just some dry ass stale cupcake - you can pick whatever you want! I recommend the Creme Brulee. Lastly, there is a fire place. 

Never been upstairs but I hear it is mediocre."}
{"text":"It was an amazing meal and the atmosphere was really nice ...enjoyed it much more  than the some of the other steak houses in the Madison area...the staff was so friendly and informative about the menu items...we were seated in the upstairs dining area and was very quiet and personal...will definitely be going back soon...thank you for a great experience"}
{"text":"Best steak I've had in Madison! Ambiance was great. If you're looking for a fancy date night this is the place to go! My bf and I are avid restaurant goers and we absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by the Holiday Inn and they were right. I travel internationally and know a great restaurant when I see it, THIS IS IT. The pork chop was great! They have a unusual mashed potato, hard to describe but it is really great. Service was spot on, clean and tidy inside. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"An appealing Gangster Style Steak House. 

Small and intimate. Nice bar area serving cocktails as they are meant to be!

Our server was attentive at all times. Unknowingly we started out ordering yesterday's dehydrated oysters. Sad day when restaurant's do this and feel no guilt! \"I needed another cocktail\"!

My sweetie-pie ordered the 16 oz. Bone-In Filet...\"cooked to order & tasty.\"

My 23 oz. Classic Bone-in Ribeye was no match for the steak knife. The overly seasoned steak tasted like a salt lick while taking forever to chisel off a piece! I worked on the \"Cap\" for about 10 minutes with no reward! Basically a $65.00 piece of grizzle going straight to the dumpster!"}
{"text":"We make an effort to try new or different places when dining out, and the standard to which they are compared is the Wonder Bar. Southern WI has a number of fine restaurants, but in years of research, it hasn't been bested."}
{"text":"Took my wife and mother in-law to Wonder Bar Steakhouse tonight. For $53 per person this should be a good steak and good service, but it's not. One of our steak was raw when ordered medium. Showed the manager the raw steak and he he said \"we make mistakes\" and didn't apologize or offer to do anything besides \"we can throw it back on the grill if you like.\" We told him it was a very expensive mistake. The server was new and told us she didn't know the differences between Ribeye, Kansas, or New York cuts. This is management's issue, she might be new but at less train her to know the different cuts of meat since she works at a steak house. The quality of the steaks was not worth the price they charged. It was not aged for flavor and not a good quality meat. I experienced a bad service, bad management, and bad quality meat. I will not be returning to Wonder Bar."}
{"text":"Yelp helped me discover this place. Before yelp I had never heard of it. My girlfriend and I gave it a try and were very happy with the meal. The decor of this place is very much like a small supper club. A small bar with a few tables. We started off with Beef Carpaccio and Crab Cakes. Both were very good. The crab cakes were big and crispy with a great sauce. For Dinner we both had a filet with crab legs. The Steak was just OK. The crab was cooked to perfection. Overall, I was satisfied with the meal, because everything other than the steak was exceptional."}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouse supper clubs in Madison. 

My husband made reservations for my birthday and requested the table by the fireplace. We arrived early to have a drink in the bar. The bar was packed and our table was available so we opted to have our cocktail there. 

They make one of the best old fashions in town. Muddled orange and cherries in the bottom of the glass with brandy and 7 up.

Our waiter was very professional and friendly. Dinners include salad and a choice of potato or vegetable. I'm not a fan of ala cart menus and appreciate these inclusions.

The house made crab bisque is excellent. It can be ordered by itself or subbed for the salad for a small up charge. It's served in a large bowl. The soup is tomato cream based with a good amount of shredded crab. The croutons on top add a nice touch. 

This is a steakhouse and you should definitely order one. These are large steaks, aged for 21 days and very tender. We ordered rare steaks and they came out perfectly seared with a warm red center. 

The waiter offered me a complimentary dessert for my birthday and served it with a candle. Very nice.

As dinner was wrapping up the manager stopped by our table, wished me happy birthday, and thanked us for our patronage.  Very classy.

This was the best service we've had in Madison."}
{"text":"I'm going right in with 5 stars. I had high expectations but was still doubtful this place could compete with Tornado. Drinks weren't quite as strong but the food was excellent. I had the bone fillet and they cooked it exactly as I requested (charred rare). The steak is enough for two. The wedge salad was outstanding and they weren't shy with the blue cheese. Do they use bacon grease to make the vinaigrette? Crispy cheese hash browns are recommend as a side. Hot buns and honey butter round out the rest of the strakhouse food groups. Tornado is a bit more fancy but on my first experience here the food quality was right up there and the prices were a bit less. Service was friendly as well and as prompt as can be expected considering the flight of stairs."}
{"text":"Don't let the name throw you off, this is one of Madison's best dining establishments. It has a unique atmosphere, a fine menu selection, excellent service and an overall great experience. You can't go wrong if you pick this spot for dinner. Try the chef selection dinner special or the house steak."}
{"text":"Interesting, I walked in to this restaurant at 10 after checking the reviews on Yelp. Yelp says they are open until 11. I just got off work after a 16 hour day (in heels) and I just wanted a glass of wine and some real food.

Bartender looked at me like I was a  piece of trash and told me they close at 10. 

Awesome."}
{"text":"Very good steak. I love their creme brûlée. Just stay away from their crab legs and lobster. Way over priced."}
{"text":"We dined at Luedtke's on 04/24/10.  We were in town for a convention.  The place was great.  The prices were reasonable, the service top notch.  Nice that the owner was at the bar, enjoying a cocktail and mingling and conversing with the customers.  We had oysters, oysters rockefeller, Carpaccio appetizers.  The oysters were ocean fresh, the beef sliced perfectly for the carpaccio.  My companion had a tomahawk bone-in ribeye.   I challenged him, doubting he could finish it, but he did.  It was done to perfection.  I had a filet and crableg combo.  Nice portion size at a very reasonable price.  The rolls were fresh baked and hot.  The hollandaise for the asparagus (included) was a bit thick but very tasty.  Cocktails are good sized as you would expect for Wisconsin.  Cozy atmosphere.   Not certain how they could improve upon the experience."}
{"text":"I don't understand the infatuation with this place.  The atmosphere is meh.  We ordered the Porterhouse, mashed potatoes, signature hash browns, and broccoli hollandaise.  Nothing was great.  The price, if I recall correctly, was around $45.  
For the ambience (lacking) and the presentation, serving me a $45 steak on a hot plate (black plate with a metal insert), I just don't understand it.  The steak was ok, but I've had better steaks at Texas Roadhouse for 1/4 the price.  I really had hoped for more out of this because it was my wife's birthday and she was disappointed.
I definitely will not go back and I'll try another place the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Made a yelp account finally because I feel like it is my civil duty to inform interested parties if they should buy into hype and spend 30$+ a plate at restaurants such as the wonderbar. 

The first time I went to the wonderbar there was seemingly no space available so we sat at the bar. Big mistake. The bartender doesn't want to entertain you and knows nothing of the menu with any depth whatsoever. Pretty shameful when the guys been working there for over twenty years. I imagine he was just mad two people were sucking up his tips at 6pm...

We ordered a drink anyways. I had a lemon drop and could not believe what I was drinking, some sour patch type of drink with massive amounts of alcohol, I wanted a refreshing cocktail not a tank of gas. Suffice to say I did not finish the drink or order another one.
What I ate:

The soup is good I'll say that. The wonderbar steak was bland, terribly bland, and I know with a little training ANYONE could make a better steak. How this is signature I will never know. 

My partner had walleye and did not believe it to be fresh.

The second time I went there i came more prepared ( I wasn't paying either time and I'm so thankful I never gave this business a cent.) it was for a birthday (which they have zero 'specials' for)

They did not even recognize it was someone's birthday, nor did they give up a free drink, what they did was sit us next to a bunch of incredible vile and loud drunks which nobody told to shut up besides US. The food once again was all very mediocre and COLD. I would recommend getting the filet over the signature ANY DAY.

with this terrible bartender, slow and deprived waitstaff, a cook that has zero clue about quality of consistency I digress saying this was one horrible experience , a waste of money and a certified ruined birthday

Never wonder about the wonderbar!"}
{"text":"AMAZING steakhouse! I lived in Madison for a year and a half and had never heard of this place, but it is definitely the best steak I've had in town.

The place has been around since before prohibition. In fact, behind the bar, they have a framed certificate that says the \"This Establishment has been Closed Due to Violation of the National Prohibition Act\" Pretty cool. It also has the original menu framed, from the early 1900's. So, very classic decor.

The food was OUTSTANDING! We had BBQ Bacon Wrapped Prawns as an appetizer and their Crab Bisque is right up there with the best I've ever had! My steak was also cooked to perfection. We had an amazing experience, intend to go back and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great steak in a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cool dining experience. 

Ate lobster & steak for dinner, cooked to perfection. Drinks we're great, bar tender was quirky and informative. The server was professional. 

It's a swanky joint, the history of the place is awesome & having the opportunity to learn about it while you wait on your table is what makes the dining experience so cool."}
{"text":"There is no better place to hang up your coat and take a seat on a miserable and cold day. Food is thoughtfully prepared and best enjoyed slowly with a good glass of your favorite beverage. Very nice staff who make you feel comfortable. It's definitely worth taking a special someone to for a meal."}
{"text":"Usually my favorite steakhouse in Madison. The service and food is always beyond expectations. Tonight I am sorry to report it was not the usual. Service was great but my steak... a 9oz filet was destroyed. What was served to me (minus the whiskey peppercorn I ordered) was less than what someone would expect from a roadside truck stop. The plate was presented with what appeared to be two dried up medallions of meat and a small side plate of mashed potatoes. The rest of my table of 8 had the true example of what wonder bar can do. Their meals looked delicious and properly cooked and served. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Standard steakhouse menu, excellently prepared.

The price is about right. Some people are talking about it like it's a budget steakhouse -- it's not. Maybe it's not as pricey as some other steakhouses in Madison, but if you want the full treatment (three courses with drinks), you're going to spend around $70-100 per person. I would suggest not skimping, because the appetizers and dessert were as good as the main course.

A lot of reviews are saying the service is bad. Maybe that was true a year ago. My experience was quite different. Our waters were refilled frequently, empty plates were cleared promptly, our food came out with perfect timing, and our server was friendly and attentive.

Highlight of the night was probably the crème brûlée. I also had crab cakes, chilled prawns, scallops, filet mignon, and lobster. It was all great, but I could have eaten a gallon of that crème brûlée."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Such amazing food , staff and atmosphere! Love the fireplaces and mobster theme throughout the place. Very cosy! Highly recommend!! Perfect date place"}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointed in the quality of food and service at Wonder Bar. I had the salmon special and the seafood was not fresh, I think I would have preferred the seafood at Red Lobster over Wonder Bar. When I told the server that I was disappointed in the quality of food, he nonchalantly shrugged. If you're looking for seafood, go down the street to Sardine....the food is exceptional."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best steaks I've ever had! The service was top-notch the food was awesome, and reminds you of an old speakeasy. The place is decorated with memorabilia from the prohibition era and it was a frequently visited place by Capone and Baby Face Nelson!  Make sure you go, we sat at the bar which was an awesome experience. The waitstaff was on point the whole night.  I opted for the crab bisque (very very very tasty) and had the filet mignon which was melt in your mouth and had a fantastic flavor. This place isn't your $10 steakhouse, you get what you pay for and you get great service with some excellent excellent food. Very impressed I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Best steak I've had for a while and the service was super friendly, fun, knowledgeable and helpful. It's a place that was formerly opened and owned by Mafia folks so there is a lot of interesting history about the place and they have cool paintings that are on theme with the whole Mafia vibe and I thought that was pretty neat. Had a cocktail named 'The Godfather' to stick with the theme of the place and it was really good. I had their signature steak which was huge and delicious and was $65 but it was worth every penny. If you have the money, treat yourself to this awesome place. If you don't have the money (my girlfriend and I are not rich in any way whatsoever), this place is still worth treating yourself to for special occasions. Awesome!"}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant.  Service was attentive and pleasant.  The food is very delicious and portions are generous.  But it has to be a restaurant you go to with a thick wallet.  The specials are just that... special to the night you arrive, not discounted.  I had a coupon and I still paid well over 60 dollars for my dinner and drink.

If you are trying to impress your date or you are feeling real flush with cash, Wonder Bar is a great place."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food. Great atmosphere. I like it better as a steak house than the old Bar Next Door, which was just a bar. They've done a great job of keeping up the old mafia bar feel without being tacky.

What I really want to say about the steak is that I love steak. I also don't make all that much money so going out to a steak house is not a common occurrence for me. Therefor when I go to a restaurant for steak I want it to be great. I would never expect the Wonder 
Bar to disappoint.

Decent wine list. Also seems like it would be fun to just hang at the bar."}
{"text":"Our server Katie was very helpful in recommending our meals she had good opinions that matched our tastes.. we ordered the stuffed chicken breast which was amazing and cooked perfectly. We also ordered a steak with crab legs which was their special and both were excellent. Their homemade dressings for the salads were equally as impressive.The atmosphere was really nice. We were lucky to get a seat in front of the fireplace. This was our first time there but we will for sure go back the next time we are visiting Madison."}
{"text":"We went here for a date after I was away for almost two weeks after a trip to Germany to bike cross around the Hamburg. I was ready for a great american steak.

I came to this place because it was pretty close to my place. I really liked the story behind the old building being gangster related. I love those rat facts about capone and a tunnel to get booze in from the lake.

I ordered the cowboy steak, It was totally awesome, the side salad and the side you get were pretty basic but the entree was huge and delicious. I went on a Tuesday the waiter didn't know  the market price of the lobster or crab legs which makes me think they must not sell too many of them. Stick to the \"famous for..\" dishes like the cowboy steak. (I can vouch for that one)"}
{"text":"Roaring fireplace, cozy bar - what's not to like?! Food rolled out on par with the atmosphere. Excellent. Great service too. Old school feel - opened in 1929 by a Chicago mobster. HIGHLY recommend the 14 oz Wonder Bar Signature Steak. Never seen anything like this... It's cut double thick, maybe 4 inches thick. I have no idea how they cook a steak like that to temperature but it came out perfect. And I mean perfect medium, juicy, and a nice char crust too. Starter went with a wedge, different spin on the wedge - served with homemade French dressing. Homemade! Mushroom side. DONE. 

You will love this place. The folks to either side of me had a ribeye and a lobster tail app. Both looked incredible. Enjoy. Entrée prices (which really weren't bad) include salad and a side."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food! Had scallops for app, seared to perfection and tasty sauce and greens. My wife and I both had the 6 oz filet, and with the salad and potato it was the perfect amount. Add the mushrooms and onions to the steaks, sets it apart from others. Good drinks and friendly staff, will continue to eat here a few times a year."}
{"text":"What a great experience. I had a craving for a good steak and found this place on Yelp. Some of the reviews made it sound like it might be hard to get in so we called ahead and they cheerfully said no problem. We were seated right away near the very cozy fireplace. Our waitress was great- I think her name was Briana? She knew the menu and made great suggestions. I had the Cowboy steak, my daughter had the filet. Both were outstanding! Be sure to try the hot bacon dressing on your salad.  I am from Chicago and these steaks were as good as any I have ever had at any of the famous downtown steak restaurants. 
I will look forward to dining here the next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times on business trips. It usually is a quick trip to Madison. But, even if I didn't have to be here, I could see myself driving to Madison to come to the Wonder Bar. Every time I have stopped in the staff is above and beyond with service and smiles. They tell you what's good and they are right. All the time (don't tell them that, lol). The steaks are hand-cut and cooked to perfection. Have I mentioned the wine list and the very sweet waitress who suggested the Bordeaux and was spot on!!  Well done!  Prost!

With servers like Jaycee and the pretty waitress, this place is bound to be a great time!"}
{"text":"Poor quality $37 steak. I understand that a ribeye has marbling but this was full of gristle. Check out the plate of fat and gristle.  Couple that with a chewy lightly flavored steak and it makes for a disappointing dinner.  Bartender/ waiter shrugged it off and stated that's what you get with a ribeye. Had he shared that you're going to get a poor quality piece of meat I would have reconsidered my dining options."}
{"text":"This place used to have pretty good steaks, but I wasn't that impressed with last night's dinner. My steak was covered in a peppercorn sauce that looked like thick mucus. The chocolate torte cake was dry and plain tasting too. If you want a n ok meal at a high price, go to this place."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner on Friday night.  There was a table open and we waited right at the front door for the host.  We waited and waited.  The two waiters could have easily sat us.  The bartender kept looking over at us and nothing.  I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"We came here Saturday night and there was a huge crowd from the badger game. With reservations it took about 15 minutes before we were seated, but we weren't in a rush.

Everything was great from the cocktails, the wine selection, and the perfectly done steak. We were glad to be seated upstairs because the downstairs area seemed a bit cramped and noisy."}
{"text":"The ultimate supper club steakhouse experience!  This small cozy quaint spot didn't disappoint.  We went on a Wednesday evening and the pack was packed!  The bar is great for waiting for a table, the gigantic fireplace in the dining room is fantastic!  Our table was a few spots away from the door...which unfortunately given the small restaurant meant we froze every time someone came in the door.  A bummer with our seasons and when we go back we will surely request a table by the fireplace!

Aside from that our food and service were outstanding.  We had the sea bass special that was cooked to perfection and my husband had the cowboy steak that literally was the size of an entire dinner plate...which was also delish.  I had the steamed broccoli and I could take it or leave it, but my husband had their hash browns and they were out of this world!!!! Cheddar, onions, potatoes...divine.  We also both had the wedge salad that was a classic steakhouse wedge done to perfection!  Definitely going back, when the weather isn't quite as frigid or when we can get a table by the fireplace!"}
