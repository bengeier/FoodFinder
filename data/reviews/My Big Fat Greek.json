{"text":"Came here with my friend before our trek through the mall. He got a gyro wrap with a pesto wrap and enjoyed it. The fries were okay, nothing to shout about.  The employees work fast so the food came out pretty quickly. Because of the store's location, you might have people walking through you if there's a long line. This place isn't bad, I have no complaints."}
{"text":"If you've never ate here you owe it to yourself to at least check it out...it's in the arrowhead mall and we make a special trip to the mall just to get a gyro.  I usually get the chicken with the pesto sauce with French fries...I love French fries and they make them quite well...you know they are completely done crispy on the outside and tender potatoes on the inside...I never had them burnt or not done...always perfection for me...  I quite impressed with the employees they are very friendly, courteous, helpful, and fast we rarely wait more than 5 minutes maybe 7 minutes, but they are fast.  Being they are in a mall many people tend to not necessarily visit it...or maybe they think there will be long lines...but there isn't long lines my guess is because they are fast...we have eaten there many times and watched as we eat...there are no long lines but there is steady business...there is usually two people waiting to order...and it amazing how when those two are gone more walk up...I enjoy their food so you eat there and check it out for yourself..."}
{"text":"Got the Aegean Pita, added fries for a dollar, great value and absolutely delicious!  They have sweet potato fries if you're into it, and did not charge for extra tsaziki sauce.   $7! Will have again!"}
{"text":"In the mall to pick up some stuff,  thought I would give this place a try. Ordered the gyro pita with salad for $1 more. Next to no tzazki sauce on it. Seriously?   Next time I will stick with a real Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"What exactly happened to my big fat Greek? Not only did the name change!Now it's called Opa Life. I ordered the same as usual Mediterranean chicken salad and it was a disaster! They literally put it on a soggy paper plate and didn't give me dressing nor pitas. The staff had no clue what's going on and it's still $9 plus tax and the fries were under done because they are rushing . It used to be my favorite."}
{"text":"this place has recently changed its name to OPA life greek express. its menu is similar but updated. i love eating here for lunch, this time ecspecialllyy it was made perfect! the new guy with the cardinals hat was very attentive and double checked the orders while preparing, which i loved because i am lactose i usually get no feta and theres been times people will still add it, so thank you to him i appreciated th extra attention to detail.i didn't catch his name. they also call out your name now when your order is ready which is nice :)"}
{"text":"Place is good for a food court counter. They have the typical gyro and lemon soup. Service was good and efficient. I didn't wait too long even though there was a long line."}
{"text":"Pretty good for the food court. I ordered a Mediterranean chicken salad and it was decent. I was a bit disappointed because I though the chicken would be freshly grilled, but it was premade and a little tough.  I did like that they were fast in putting the order together. Despite the line, I didn't have to wait too long to receive my order, which was probably contributed by the chicken not being grilled to order."}
