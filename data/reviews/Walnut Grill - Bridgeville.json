{"text":"I've always enjoyed Walnut Grill but the last few visits have been disappointing.  Tonight was the last straw.  My son came in from out of town to take me to dinner for my birthday.  I suggested Walnut Grill.  We were seated around 8:00 PM and with very little interaction from our server, our meal finally arrived around 9:15.  We both ordered the filet mignon and it was not worth the wait.  It was flavorless and not prepared as requested.  The server was apathetic at best.  Honestly, we both agreed that we have had better at Outback. It was a strange experience.  We were the only customers seated in the one section and it felt like we were forgotten about.  Our server was one of the least engaged I've ever had.  I wont be going back.  There are way too many other decent restaurants to visit."}
{"text":"Don't go for the Sunday brunch. The server Mike was great but the food was dreadful. Looked like leftovers they couldn't get rid of during the week. Much of it was inedible. At $17.95 they have nerve putting that stuff out"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, very pleasant waitstaff, and delicious food.  I had the Blackened Salmon BLT with sweet potato fries and my wife had the Fish Tacos with a fresh field greens salad. She raved about both and I was very impressed with my meal as well. I will definitely be back again to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I went there with my girlfriend on Sunday afternoon and was seated in the dining room. It was pretty empty. Carrie was our waiter and she did a good job. 
I ordered the chicken lettuce wrap appetizer. It was ok but nothing noteworthy. 
I ordered the veal special. The veal was tough and chewy and the breading made it greasy. The mashed potatoes and carrots were good. 
My girlfriend had the chicken alfredo over pasta. She said the alfredo was ok but the pasta was overcooked and starchy. 
This was my 3rd visit to this restaurant and the first time we were not totally satisfied. The manager came out to apologize and gave us a $20 deduction off our bill."}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff is friendly and food is delicious. Recommend the chicken with mushrooms, strip steak or gnocchi.  We have never left disappointed!"}
{"text":"I just hosted a surprise bridal shower for my sister at this location. I did it all over the phone since I don't live in town. They were very easy to work with and very accommodating. I called the hostess before we arrived to go over everything. They helped us pull off the surprise! We had a few selections on a personalized menu to choose from, and the food was good and came out very quickly after everyone ordered. For a very reasonable fee they also cut and served our cake. The waiters were extremely nice and efficient and took care of the many drink orders throughout the night quickly. We left behind balloons and other decor and they told us they would take care of it. We stayed about 20 minutes past closing and we were never rushed out of there. I would definitely host an event here again. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Went for Mothers Day. Made reservations 2 weeks in advance. Total disaster.  We did not get seated  for 20 minutes Service was the worst ever. Food took 1 hour.  Manager was called over to complain Manager had lost control of restaurant. Food was awful on menu and buffet. I had been there once before and it was ok. Never again"}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. great, extensive food and drink menu. Clean place. They also have great specials for each day of the week!"}
{"text":"We went for happy hour this weekend and we were greeted instantaniously as soon as we sat down. Our bartender Dan was super helpful with the beer selections and all of the specials that were going on. All of the other bartenders were on the ball as well, making sure we were never in need of anything. The food was out of this world. Major props to this business for being on the ball right out of the gates. We will definately be back!!"}
{"text":"There's a reason that the other local Walnut Grill's have closed and based on my recent experience, I firmly believe this one is on the fast-track to follow suit.  First, it must be disclosed that on Mother's Day 2016, our party of six did not have a reservation.  With that said, our decision to visit the Walnut Grill was based upon an earlier phone call which confirmed the wait would be no more than one hour.  This was acceptable given the circumstances, and would give our party a chance to meet at the bar for cocktails anyway.  Upon arrival to a near-dead-empty restaurant, we were advised by the hostess that the wait would be 3 hours, unless we wanted to eat outside.  We saw that the patio (also empty as it was 60 degrees and falling) was equipped with heat lamps, so we opted to sit outside.  The hostess advised that we could simply let her know when we were ready to be seated after our cocktails at the bar, which we did approximately 30 minutes later.  The hostess then led us to a table on a different patio at the opposite side of the building near the front parking lot.  This patio offered no space heaters.  Despite these setbacks, we decided to stick it out and make the best of the situation, after all, we made it to a table at a restaurant on Mother's Day without reservations.  It's worth mentioning that we could see countless tables inside the restaurant that remained vacant throughout the duration of our visit.  After a brief wait, our waitress arrived with menus.  We spent about 15 minutes perusing the \"special\" Mother's Day Menu, which is different and dissimilar to the traditional Walnut Grill menu.  The waitress arrived and took our orders: 2 cedar-planked salmon and 4 NY strip steaks.  Approximately 20 minutes later, the waitress returned with a basket of bread, which she set on the table and again disappeared.  We had no place settings or plates so we were forced to wait for her return to ask for these items.  When we did, she brought 4 plates and 2 place settings while at the same time advising us that the kitchen had run out of NY strip steaks.  Disappointed, we all chose the next-most similar (but more expensive) menu item, the filet.  The waitress disappeared again, this time for around 45 minutes.  When she finally re-emerged, we politely asked how much longer we could expect to wait, especially for the soup that was ordered (over 1 hour ago).  She lazily advised that the wait would be at least 20 more minutes and that the soup for some bizarre unknown reason, would arrive with the entrees.  How she came up with the 20 minute estimation is anyone's guess.  At this point, we decided to re-evaluate our options and considered leaving, but believed we were close enough to the finish line that we opted to stay.  20 more long minutes later, our meals finally arrived, which in this case one would think would be a blessing.  I can only speak to the quality of my own meal, but will attest that nobody appeared overly excited about the food on their plates.  Unfortunately, my filet was cooked \"medium\", as was the preference when the original NY strip steak was ordered- my fault, I guess for not re-specifying, but nonetheless it was a bland slab of meat.  Nothing special about the baked potato or garden slaw.  Word about our table's long wait and unrest must have made its way to the restaurant's manager, as he arrived at our table to offer an apology- and a price reduction on our bill- a nice gesture, for which most of us were appreciative, but which was too little, too late.  This restaurant is a total mess- from the awkward, separationist floorplan to the bartenders' avoidance-of-eye contact policy to the trash-strewn restrooms- just an overall pretty terrible experience.  Not sure how long this place can last in it's state of mismanagement.  The waitress who served us was unacceptably untrained, which is a disappointment at a restaurant asking $26-38 per entrée.  In my opinion, Walnut Grill has attemped to position itself as an \"up-market\" restaurant without first taking care of the small details that are to be expected of comparable restaurants.  No place of business can operate in the manner which the Walnut Grill does and expect to stay in business long. I predict this restaurant will be closed in the very near, if not immediate future.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Went to Walnut Grill tonight because its local and was a favorite until tonight. We brought a special guest from out of town. The place was not busy and we sat in the bar (party of three, sat in a booth) 
The waiter was in SLIW MOTION  we ordered drinks and then watched him wander around before calling him over to take our order. 
When our drinks were empty we called him over twice before he placed our drink order at the bar. We saw the drinks sitting there but no Bobby. 
Two other wait staff came out with our meals and had to ask Booby which table to serve. 
We asked them to grab our drinks from the bar. 
So, not sure we will go back let alone take our out of town guests for poor service and food that was just ok, not great. 
Giving one star because fewer was not an option."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner at the new Walnut Grill last night.  I usually wait a couple months until the bugs are worked out of any new restaurant, but my friends said the food was great and to give it a try.  We weren't disappointed. The the balsamic and wild mushroom chicken dishes were fantastic.  The table service was excellent.  The only snag was waiting a short time on a reservation.  Again, we eat out regularly and have experienced nightmares going to new restaurants.  This was a minor issue for us since they were extremely busy.  I gave them 5 stars based on what they accomplished in a short period of time.  The food and table service are worth the wait, but make make reservations on weekends to avoid longer waits."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Walnut Grille. We have actually been there a number of times. Food was good. Drinks are great. Great red and white sangria. The dining room was slightly chilly."}
{"text":"Just left the place because the service was horrible. This place used to be good. The beer selection also used to be good but now it seems they want to get rid of their winter beer and don't have any other micro brew selection."}
{"text":"We live nearby and have been to this location quite a bit. Their Sunday dinner specials are excellent. Very good food for the price. We have been surprised a few times by the quality of the food. I would recommend WG to anyone looking for an above-average dinner."}
{"text":"Love Walnut Grill. Great happy hour spot and I've enjoyed dinner here before but the new brunch is aweful! Worst brunch I've had in some time...most items were store / warehouse brought vs being made in-house and lacked flavor, no omelet station and desserts weren't good either. Sorry  Walnut Grill :("}
{"text":"Worst brunch in Pittsburgh. The baked eggs looked and tasted like a fisher price kids kitchen toy. No one should feel comfortable serving something like that. The waitstaff was friendly, though, and kept the breakfast drinks flowing, so that's a plus, I guess."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner this Friday evening. The restaurant was busy as there was a nhl playoff game on. Upon arriving, we waited for two hostesses to finish their conversation before noticing us. We were told (or more accurately shown with a waving hand) that the bar area was open seating. After sitting at a table, we watched 15 minutes of the game before being approached by a server. The wine my girlfriend ordered was not available due to an upcoming menu update. I ordered a domestic draft. Another 10-15 minutes passed and the server came back to inform me they were out if the beer. 

We then ordered our food. My girlfriend got a strawberry salad which was fine, I ordered the chicken spiedini and was told they were also out of this due to the menu update. The server quickly offered to actually check the availability of the item and I offered a back up selection.  The dish was well prepared when I received it.

Throughout the evening we experienced 20-30 minute gaps between our server stopping at the table. The only factor which made this passable was the game on the tv's. 

Overall, the food was good when we did eventually receive it but the overall experience was horrid. Our server was very nice and helpful, but she appeared to be the only server working a crowded bar area during a home team championship game on a beautiful Friday evening. If the restaurant is planning a menu change, they may want to transition their meals more efficiently to avoid large amounts of the current menu not being available.

The preparedness of having one of the most popular domestic drafts out of stock 10 minutes into a game night is laughable as well. Simply one of the most disappointing dining experiences I have ever had, the only positive was our servers ability to remain upbeat despite the hurdles she was forced to overcome."}
{"text":"Their food is great. I had the chicken and mushrooms in a light cream sauce and was pleasantly surprised. I only wish they had coupons or discounts, as their food is somewhat pricey."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Sunday and sat at the bar. While it took several minutes for us to be acknowledged, the bartender was very attentive and kind going forward. 

My gripe was with the food. I started with the chili that had two pieces of meat in it. The taste was good but it all tomato sauce. For my main course I ordered the California turkey wrap with sweet potato fries. The wrap came out with all the wrong ingredients on it. The \"fries\" were literally a sweet potato sliced in quarters. Because we had already been there for some time, I asked for it just to be taken off the check and taken away. Instead the kitchen brought out a new plate even though the bartender asked them not to.

All in all the kitchen was a mess, but our server was very sweet and apologetic."}
{"text":"What is the point of making a reservation online when you get there and they tell you that they're sorry they can't seat you for another 25 minutes. Awful awful service. I'm sorry you're busy, but I made reservations, so you should seat us first. Never again. Their food is average at best too."}
{"text":"Garbage. An hour and a half to receive our order, meal was cold and terrible. The manager stated that they had a large party come in and that was the reason for the late service. They were nowhere near capacity in the restaurant at that time, which should be the goal of the business, also limited people in front at the bar. Slob manager offered deserts for the trouble. I'm sure that's the go-to for his life problems, deserts. Do not patron this location. Excuse making joke in charge trickles down to garbage experience."}
{"text":"We had a great experience. Our waitress was so nice and our food was so good. We got the pulled pork nachos and it was so huge that we didn't order anything else. We were very pleased and we will be back !"}
{"text":"First visit to the Walnut Grill for a birthday party.  I was impressed by the décor inside.  It was fresh and modern.  I really liked the variety on the drink menu.  The service was good at the bar and liked that they had a special even though it wasn't happy hour ($4.00 Long Island).  I ordered to go \"Chef Randy's Gyro\".  I got home and opened up the bag and was really surprised.. this wasn't your typical 'to go\" quality or portion size.  It was amazing.  The gyro was fresh and bursting with flavor and there was no shortage of fries.  

Looking to my next visit.  Cheers"}
{"text":"It was better than I expected. One of the few places that have a good brunch on Sunday morning. I had an omelet, specially prepared the way I like it, and with fruit and apple cobbler. There was
 a wide range of other food on the buffet ,which I did not partake of, but I could have over eaten easily. It was a little pricey but not too."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight at WG Bridgeville to celebrate my sister's birthday.  The food was great and the service was top notch from the moment we arrived.  Our server, Diane, paid attention to details and met our special requests to accommodate the celebration with a smile.  Everyone in our group enjoyed the evening."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Walnut Grill
Location. I've always received great service when dining here."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and decor.  Bar is a good place to meet with friends and colleagues.  

Food is pretty good and our kids enjoy their meals as well which is always a challenge.  I would recommend for a variety of experiences from hanging out, happy hrs, to family dinners.  Service is friendly and prompt.  Waiting for summer to see what its like on their patio."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch!!!  Our Server, Ann was excellent. She gave us great suggestions and she was attentive! Food was great! Nice atmosphere! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I love Walnut Grill and this was the first time I was at this location. There were a couple things that happened that I decided to rate a 3 Star. The food was pretty good. I had the California turkey wrap. I thought it was really good! It had candied bacon, honey mustard and goat cheese (which I love!). Our waitress was very nice, however, she seemed to be focused on the fact that it was busy and I felt that she had her mind on other things. While taking my friend's order, another customer asked if they were to pay up front or wait for her, and in mid order she apologized and left to get the other woman's check. We just found it odd since only one person out of the 4 of us had given our order. Then, someone else brought out our food but completely forgot my friend's salad. It was about 5 minutes that our waitress came back and we told her that her food was missing. Overall, I was pleased with my meal but probably wouldn't go back during such a busy time."}
{"text":"My husband had my 50th birthday party there one week after it open. All I can say is the food was very good. The private room was set up so everyone could mingle. The service was outstanding!!! We had over 50 people there and we never had an empty glass and the food was continuously replenished . We will definitely be regulars.  Markus the manager was so accommodating, He has a great staff. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come here often and it's probably our go to restaurant right now. Food is always good as is the service. Reasonably priced, great atmosphere, and perfect location with plenty of parking."}
{"text":"This place just opened last week so a coworker & I decided to try them out.  We were seated in the dining area.  The decor is quite nice.  The staff was very upbeat & friendly but, as my coworker put it, they have some kinks to still work out.

Shortly after we were seated, we had two different servers attempt to take our drink order.  There seemed to be some confusion over who was supposed to be handling our table.  After it was figured out, I ordered the flat bread chicken sandwich.  The flat bread was burned rather badly on the edges and underside.  Also it really did not resemble much of a \"sandwich\", it was more or less just piled on to the plate.  I was also told I'd have a refill as soon as the iced tea was done brewing but it never happened.  

On the upside, the sweet potato fries were very good and my coworker's burger also looked very appetizing.

If you do visit, I would suggest trying to get seated in the bar area as it looked very open with a lot of natural lighting but would recommend you avoid the flat bread chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"this experience was amazing, I have absolutely no complaints at all. the food was amazing and the restaurant was clean and the bathrooms were fantastic. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great dining experience. Amber our server took very good care of us. everything came out in a timely manner and looked delicious. again I would recommend walnut grill to anyone looking for a great dining experience. definitely a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went for dinner this past Sunday expecting the usual great food & service as we've had many times before but  were very disappointed! .  Started with onion soup  (great flavor but was  topped with lump of mozzarella cheese, awkward to enjoy) & also did chicken  quesoadilla. Huge portion as an app (plan to share! ) and is tasty but not great,  not a typical quesoadilla. For mains had the red snapper (ok but salsa way too spicy) and crab stuffed flounder  (crab stuffing  good but fish way over cooked.)  I had ordered the flounder & instead of usual sides requested  a small salad and veg special  (grilled asparagus.) Server nice but fussed, said asparagus would  be extra  $2.  Duh? Gee ok, fine...that's  what I'd like.  What  was very upsetting is when my entrée arrived I was given a plate with the flounder, a baked sweet potato and something that looked  (and tasted ) like lawn clippings. Server said sorry, forgot the asparagus but can put that order in,will take  5 min.  I asked her to not bother,please  make sure we weren't charged. Upsetting because she didn't  offer  to correct my order  even when she noticed it was totally wrong &  darn,  never  got my salad!  Overall, very dissapointed  in the service & food. Have had good there in the past but do not plan to return."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Walnut Grill for so long. Now I'm kind of disappointed I didn't go sooner! First of all, the swanky atmosphere of the restaurant is very cool. We sat on the heated patio - which I'm actually grateful for since the \"inside\" restaurant seemed a little loud. You still get the atmosphere on the patio, but being able to visit with everyone at the table was nice.

We ate here on a Saturday, and it's really nice they still do a happy hour on the weekend. 5-7 is $3 drafts, $3 house wine and $5 Long Island Iced Teas. The drafts even include some craft options which was very nice! 

The menu itself had so many unique items on it, it was hard to choose from. The meat and pasta entrees on average ranges from $15-$20 so i was a little tempted to choose a sandwich since that was a little cheaper (parents were paying and I always feel bad getting something on the pricier side) but I just had to try the Thai Pork Mac n' Cheese. It was delicious! Don't be fooled by the mac n' cheese title though - it's much more of an alfredo pasta dish. So delicious. I was full but kept eating because it was so good.

Everyone at the table was very happy with their food - some other dishes people got were the sweet & spicy chicken, fish tacos, gnocchi, greek pasta and sun-dried tomato pasta . The service is also super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! The food is upscale bar food with a great atmosphere in either the dining or the bar areas. Good drink specials as well! Parking is a little rough on Fridays and Saturdays as it is Ina busy busy plaza."}
{"text":"The service was top notch. You must try the pork nachos.  Dressings are all made in house and are very good."}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  Where is our waitress? Has anyone seen our waitress? I ordered the crispy chicken BLT wrap ... one small piece of chicken for whole wrap! The portions seemed like we ordered of kids menu!
Beer was NOT COLD! NOT A REPEAT CUSTOMER!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!!! Very nice place and will definitely be back!! Pittsburgh flat bread was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This is basically somewhat-upscale diner food.  We ended up here on New Years Eve (long story, but an emergency prevented us from getting to the restaurant where our original reservation was on time).  I was surprised at how many people chose to eat at this very casual establishment for NYE and the staff was slammed.  Our server had a terrible attitude.  My friend found a very long hair in her food and the server was very rude about it.  The manager came over and was appropriate.  I'd go back for a casual lunch or dinner but this is definitely not a special occasion place."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Sunday around noon for lunch and the restaurant was at about 25% capacity.  We asked to sit outside and were informed the only outside seats were on the patio with no shade.  We agreed to sit there even though the sun was bright today, not expecting to be waiting 1.5+ hours for our food service.  After ordering our drinks, we waited up to an hour for our food.  We noticed the patrons around us receiving gift cards because the \"kitchen was so behind today\".  Our server offered us a punch card for breakfast/lunch where we would each purchase another lunch then be able to receive a free meal. Ok, not great but nice gesture.  
The food here is not fresh and mostly it is a bar type menu with fatty foods.  I ordered the \"chicken and artichoke\" sandwich which was basically spinach and artichoke dip on a flatbread.  There was oil pooling on the \"sandwich\".  It was listed as grilled chicken with spinach, tomato, artichoke and asiago atop pita bread.  I was not expected to have spinach and artichoke dip slapped on a flatbread.  Gross. 
After waiting an hour for our food, we finally ate, and my fiancé asked for one more beer.  It took 20 minutes to actually get our beer and then another 20 minutes to get our bill cashed out.  This was not because the kitchen was \"going through some changes\" as we were told, it was just plain poor service. 
We eventually moved from the patio to the outside bar area.  While there, a group of people walked in with a small dog (not a service dog) and took the dog right up to the bar.  The bartender went out to pet the dog, which is clearly a health code violation.  This dog shouldn't be so close to the food service area.  Obviously if they allow dogs right at the bar, there are likely many other health code violations that we aren't even aware of!

According to the Allegheny Couny Health Department:
326.6 Animals
A. Live animals shall be excluded from within the food facility operational areas and from immediately adjacent areas.

C. Animals accompanying physically challenged persons shall be permitted in customer areas. Patrol dogs accompanying security or police officers shall be permitted in offices, storage areas and the outside premises.

D. While on duty, persons employed in the food operational areas of a facility shall not care for or handle any animals."}
{"text":"Arrived at 5:50 for a 6 PM reservation.   Was told at front desk they did not have any tables available that we would have to wait 35 to 40 minutes.  I then reminded the hostess we had reservations and she said oh ok let me look again.  They took us back and there were open tables all over.  It took us over an hour to receive our entrees.  I ordered a wedge salad and I received a chopped salad smaller than what I would normally receive at any other restaurant as a side salad.  I have had better food at Eat n Park.  I will not be patronizing this establishment in the future."}
{"text":"Updated review ! We went back for happy hour. Same friend and I wanted to get drinks. I showed up early and got a table. I was sat immediately and my server came over to me offered to get me a drink. She was super nice and funny. 

My friend came and we had drinks. We got happy hour which was 3 dollar drafts , so we had a few. We picked tuna, stuffed peppers, tots, and boneless wings to eat. Everything was so good! It was my birthday so our server brought me ice cream too. I will definitely be coming back to this location !!



I want to go back at a different time in the day to see if I have a different experience. 
I went with my best friend. She waited sometime to get her first drink. I showed up and we waited to get our drinks. Our server came up and asked if we had been waited on. 

The meals were good. We really enjoyed our food. We both had the pick a pairs I had shrimp pasta and a strawberry salad, it was good. It was a little bland but with some hot sauce, it was good.

Our server was good and  as very nice. The restaurant I think was just crowded today.

I will definitely come back because the food was good and happy hour was better."}
{"text":"We started off with a couple drinks and the sangria was on special as was the bloody mary. We were told that the sangria has less alcohol in it when on special. It was still quite tasty though as was the bloody mary. 
We ordered a flatbread as an appetizer and at 12.99 we expected it to be good. It never came out until entrees did and on top of that it was mahhh. 
We did the pick two at 16.99. My wife got a chicken dish and her portion was very small. The beet salad was fantastic but was brought with dinner which makes no sense.
Overall way too pricey for what you're served. One and done..."}
{"text":"Food was ok had chicken and waffles.. when I think chicken in waffles I think waffle wit 2 or three wings... this was a waffle that was under cooked (could have been more crispy ) and chicken was jus a sad little pattie but the orange and jalapeño sauce was the best part and saved the dish from being horrible. Potatoes where best thing and they were basic. But I'm sure they have other tasty dishes"}
{"text":"I was so surprised and disappointed with the Sunday brunch. The food was lukewarm at best and we could not eat it. We ordered breakfast from the menu and it was still not very good. The scrambled eggs were watery and the bacon had been cooked earlier and was reheated. The pancake were the worst, they were dirty (had been cooked on the same surface as sausage and tasted like sausage). Usually WG is very good and has good food but they need to work on their brunch and breakfast. One good point, our waitress was outstanding in fixing the situation the best she could."}
{"text":"Arrived early for dinner. Quick seating. House wines are fine. Chardonnay and Cabernet. Cod with Crab very tasty. Filet was way undercooked but they took care of it quickly. Filet was only OK in my opinion. Cole slaw as a side is average and fries are quite tasty. They really need to step up their game for side orders. Overall I would rate this as average for the price paid. Waitress very pleasant."}
{"text":"Had a disappointing experience this evening after sitting for 20 minutes without a visit from waitstaff.  A couple seated in the booth across from us seemed to be struggling with a billing dispute and a coupon, but we were trying to be patient, but no one seemed to care that we were never asked for drink choices or brought bread.  We were looking forward to eating a nice meal as the menu had some interesting items, but we moved on because we were celebrating my mother's birthday and didn't want our evening spoiled."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with the family. Have been waiting to try Walnut Grill having heard good things. Walnut Grill did not disappoint. Everything was great, from the staff, to the decor, and the food was very good. Tasty and fresh, perfectly done and very nice portions. The group tried a variety of dishes from burgers, to fish and pasta. Everyone was happy and it was delish, can't wait to go back!  Great menu! Great food! Great place! Cheers"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Walnut Grill!! I hardly ever do this, but I always get the same thing here...their Brie & chicken quesadilla & chopped cob salad.

The quesadilla is one of my favorites. The grapes are my favorite part.

As a huge fan of chopped salads theirs is one of the best. It's all about the ratio, and they do it so well! The dressing is my favorite part. 

I will always pick WG over the chains that surround it!!!!"}
{"text":"We visited at 5:30 on a Sunday. It took 50 minutes to get food. When our food finally arrived, the Parmesan crusted gnocchi that we ordered showed up as Parmesan crusted chicken on a bed of pasta. As the plate was being served, the waitress says apparently we are out of gnocchi and that wasn't on our 86 board. Here's the problem, pasta IS NOT an acceptable automatic substitution for gnocchi and therefore, we should have been notified before the plate arrived at the table. We absolutely should been notified prior and. given the opportunity to charge the order, which we would have done. If I order a mixed green salad, you can't just give me a Caesar salad because they are both called salad. At this point, sending it back and waiting another exorbitant amount of time for a new entree just wasn't a feasible option, so we ended up eating something we didn't want...and paying $18.00 for it. 
To top it off, the French Onion soup was so salty, I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Wow very disappointed. We've been here a few times and it was nothing memorable. Food was ok but pricey, service fair. We went last night for dinner and asked to sir outside. They sat us next to a table that was pulled high with seat cushions and to make matters worse, never even came to our table for 20 minutes. We saw about 4 servers, not one even acknowledged us, even as I was trying to flag her down. We did speak to the manager who apologized and gave us a gift card. Truthfully doubt we will go back though."}
{"text":"It's just ok and very overpriced. I've tried 3 times because I wanted so badly to love it. I tried the balsamic glazed salmon in my last visit and it was dry and bland. My bill was over $30, for 1 meal and no alcohol. Way too expensive for a piece of dry dish."}
{"text":"While I do like that they offer the pick a pair meal deal - both of the times I've been here to have the filet choice - the meat was over cooked.  While this is a convenient location, I do wish the staff was a bit more timely in delivering check and returning your card, getting to your table to order drinks and food etc.  

I prefer the Wexford location.  Food is better there!  Staff is more efficient!"}
{"text":"Just left after waiting 20 minutes for our waitress to return and take our order.  Went to front desk to complain but they seemed not too concerned that we were leaving.  Have been to this restaurant for dinner at least twice a month in the last year and always enjoyed food and good service.  That will change as there are plenty of good restaurants that value a customer's time.  I will now go to the Walnut Grill once every 3 months.  Why patronize a restaurant that must not care about good service?"}
{"text":"I've been to Walnut Grill several times and it has always been on point whether in terms of quality of service, food, drink or ambiance. The have a nice wine selection including some local options I usually like to go with what the server recommends. The flash fried brussel sprouts are my favorite. I'd also recommend the vermicelli with white wine garlic sauce. For lunch, they offer this \"pick a pair\" combo, where you can pick from salads, soups or half a sandwich. It ends up being a really filling meal. Walnut grill hasn't failed to consistently provide a satisfactory experience on different occasions whether with friends, colleagues or on a date, but it's been just that - satisfactory. I haven't yet had my mind blown with any aspect of the experience, whether something I've eaten or something else. I also don't think their menu has changed in the past couple of years. It's just that I like this place.. but I think I've gotten bored with it."}
{"text":"Overpriced for bland food. Service was extremely slow. The hummus was completely flavorless. Best part of the meal was the complimentary bread which they didn't remember to bring out until we were almost finished. Never tried this place so I was looking forward to eating there because of the menu, only to be utterly disappointed. I gave 2 stars only because our server was nice and the restaurant itself, was clean."}
{"text":"The place was dead as expected on a Sunday afternoon. So you'd think the service would be great. But not the case. We had to tell the hostess twice that we needed our waitress.

Waitress returned 15 minutes later. We were told she was taking another table's order.

We did finally order. But waitress never came back to refill our drinks. We had to ask the server when our food came. Everyone's plates had obviously say on a warmer for awhile since the plates were very hot.

My flatbread came out way over cooked around the edges and gooey in the middle.

Pretty disappointed with the experience and will not be back. Funny that my in laws said that this location was better than the one in Mt. Lebanon. I'm glad we didn't go THERE!!"}
{"text":"Walnut Grill- An over-priced and under-serviced eatery in Pittsburgh.

I came here with two friends a few weeks ago when I came back to Pittsburgh for a visit.  Walnut Grill looked like they had a decent menu, and the vibe looked cool.  We came in around 8:00 on a Friday night and were immediately seated.  Our server was nice and kept the drinks full, but that was the high point of the meal.

The one food item that we ordered and really enjoyed was the Pulled Pork Nachos ($14).  It easily fed three people, and the sweet sauce and toppings were unique and delicious.  I wish I had just gotten the nachos, as did the rest of my party.  Our table also ordered the Salmon BLT ($14), Beer-Battered Cod ($13), and I ordered the Parmesan-Crusted Chicken and Gnocchi ($18).  My meal was passable, but my friends ate less than two bites of theirs.  The meals were just not very good.

The lowest point was the service as it got later.  Our meals took a while to be prepared by the kitchen so we were one of the last people in the dining room.  Once our plates were cleared, one of the servers turned out the lights in the dining room and walked out.  First, if you wanted to leave that quickly, at least ask us to move our seats to the bar.  Second, maybe you should admit that if your kitchen is slow, you should not be additionally rude to the patrons.

Overall, I was not impressed and would not recommend Walnut Grill.  Leave the suburbs for dinner or look for a local and better casual sit down place, like Mad Mex."}
{"text":"Happened to be nearby for business and was taken here. Definitely a solid option. Lots of flavorful and healthful options. Nice patio area for pleasant days (which this was). The service was nothing to write home about, but no real complaints. Basically exactly what you'd expect. I'd consider returning if I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"Just take a look at the photo of the salad....the photos tell only half of the story.   The food was as good as it looks.  We ordered one Caprese Salmon Salad and one Cobb Salad.  The Caprese Salmon Salad came and it looked like a work of art.  A large piece of grilled Salmon, grilled and lightly season, fresh, soft, Buffalo, mozzarella cheese, sliced, Heirloom tomatoes with a Balsamic sauce drizzled around everything.  The Cobb Salad was a mixture of sliced chicken, bacon, sliced egg, tomatoes, lettuce....chopped to perfection.  I love a salad that I don't have to cut.  Both salads were amazing...I rinsed my salad down with a glass of Pelligrino served in a Wine glass with a slice of lemon and a slice a lime....yum...
Our server Courtney was sweet and attentive and gave us the Veteran discount...every Tuesday every Veteran gets a FREE meal with a purchase of a meal.  So 
calling all VETERANS....come on Tuesday for your free meal.
We both had a great lunch and a great time.
We will be back..."}
{"text":"We have given this place a few tries and we are done. The service is the worst. Our server disappeared for huge chunks of time and our meal ended up taking 1.5hrs. It wasn't even busy. Our kids food came out first and they were done eating and getting antsy while we waited another 25 minutes for our food. During this time we asked for ice cream for the kids. She eventually brought our food 15 minutes later and the ice cream 5 min later. Then I asked for a couple boxes. Apparently she thought we were done with our app and kids food because she took it away. I was going to box it up. She said the kitchen could remake it but that probably would have required another 35 min wait. We complained to the manager and they didn't seem to care. No apology at all. Food was only decent. NEVER going back."}
{"text":"Its really good for happy hour. Stuffed peppers was really tasty. Pinnacle vodka. Drinks were great! Citrus and orange flavor"}
{"text":"The hostess and the waiter seemed like nice people. Too bad that the appetizer and entrees came out slowly and tasted mediocre at best. The pulled-pork nachos could have used more cheddar cheese and more avocados in the guacamole. My crusted Atlantic cod could have been cooked a bit longer. It was difficult to cut with my butter knife and fork, and I kept poking it with my finger to make sure that it was not cold and raw. I left half of it on my plate, and I commented to my husband that I was still hungry. My husband's chicken and gnocchi tasted just OK according to him, and he said that we would never return to this restaurant. The waiter did bring drink refills."}
{"text":"The place was pretty good. I think it wants to be slightly higher end than the average location. It was clean and nice ambiance. I had a top shelf margarita and it was much too sweet. I switched to beer after that. People behind the bar were not exceedingly friendly but that is ok. Had some appetizers and they were pretty good. Overall a place you should try at least once. I think our experience may have been on a bad service day."}
{"text":"My fiance, future mother-in-law, and I attended dinner here recently. We were so impressed that we ended up booking our rehearsal dinner here! The crabcakes were delicious, my fiance had an out of this world steak, and my MIL had the balsamic chicken, which is my new favorite dish. The atmosphere was very friendly and the waitstaff was super attentive. They do have certain specials on different nights, and we happened to get the $15 bottle of wine night. Being it seems as though they switch up their wine selection, that is the only thing that the waitress wasn't 100% sure about, but she checked on our questions before bringing our bottle out.

As for the private space, there is a large back room that will fit a very large group of people. It can also be split into two separate rooms which is a very nice feature for smaller groups. One of the rooms has access to the outside patio and we have been told that by the summertime they may even be offering live music outside.

All in all, this place has a great vibe. It is modern without being over the top and the food was phenomenal. Not knowing all of the restaurants in our area, it had been extremely hard booking a rehearsal that everyone would like that would also have a relaxed vibe and would also be under $40 per person. After eating at Walnut Grill, the choice was an absolute no-brainer."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with friends. Highly recommend making reservations as it is a new restaurant in bridgeville.

Great selections and I highly suggest the tomato basil salad dressing. It is so good! Serve warm bread with specialty butters and always have drink specials. Saturday nights are $4 Long Island iced teas. Desserts are not too large and shouldn't be skipped over. Hoping to go soon for brunch! Oh and they have a take out menu!"}
{"text":"I remember when this was a Damon's. They've really changed it inside for the better. Bright blues and wood touches, but I didn't go into the dining room. 

I was impressed with the draft list and there were some interesting cocktails on the menu, but we were only in for a quick lunch.

The Pittsburgh chicken salad was okay but not interesting. The lobster mac and cheese and deviled eggs were awesome appetizers though. They didn't skimp on the lobster. I also tried some of the cod entree and it was good.

The lounge has a lot of TVs and it seems like an unexpectedly good place to watch a game. Actually, better than Damon's ever was!"}
{"text":"Ate here recently with my daughter, son-in-law and his parents.  We were in town for a visit. We thought we were going to have to have a long wait since it was busy and there were six of us, but they got us right in on the heated patio.  I ordered fish tacos and chose a baked sweet potato as my side.  They were delicious.  It was so much food.  I got three tacos and the sweet potato was HUGE. Everyone else at the table really enjoyed their meals.  Drinks were good and we were able order at happy hour prices for dinner. Waitress was very friendly and professional  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a beautiful summer evening and sat outside at the bar.  The atmosphere outside was very cool.  They also had heaters and vinyl enclosures for colder weather.  

Dan was my bartender and server and was very good and had a great knowledge of the menu and various beers.  It didn't hurt that we liked a lot of the same beers. 

I had the Tuna appetizer which was good but would have been better if the tuna was cooked less.  It should be barely seared and almost cold in the center.  As my entree I had the fish tacos which I thought were very good.  

I would come here again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"A Valentine's day tradition that never gets old!  We make a point of eating here every year for Valentine's day (and other occasions) just because we know the food will always be great and we won't be let down.  We order a variety of food normally but you can never go wrong with their filet.  Great flavor and cooked perfectly every time!  Happy hour deals are great and the service overall is also."}
{"text":"I visted the Walnut Grill in Bridgeville recently for dinner with my four friends.  I ordered the crab cake dinner with green beans.  It was very tasty!  The server brought our bread after most of us were finished with our meals which was unfortunate.  My crab cake dinner was $24 which is a little pricey for Bridgeville and the portion size.  My total bill was $54 before my 20% tip.  While we were signing our bills the manager walked over and asked us to leave. He said he was just trying to make everyone happy.  He offered us free drinks at the bar which we declined.  This was an uncomfortable ending to our visit to the Walnut Grill.  I could understand if we ordered waters with lemons and side salads.  However, we all ordered drinks (except one friend who ordered lemonade) and two of my friends ordered dessert on top of our meals!  Strangely, we never saw anyone waiting for a table when we left!  So thanks but no thanks!  We are a group of professionals and stay at home mothers who will not be returning to this estsblishment!"}
{"text":"...had a function here with individuals at work and it turned out to be a great time. The food was excellent and the holiday beers flowed. We were positioned outside in a tented area which I thought was initially odd, but it was well heated and was a good barrier from the other patrons."}
{"text":"We ended up here because we thought the menu had options for everyone.  We were wrong.  We ordered the Brussel sprouts and they were under cooked. The kids ordered wings and were charged an extra 50 cents for a very small side of bbq sauce - (it's just the point). We are still waiting for a flatbread - 
Really not a great place and we won't be back - ever.  I will say the waitstaff was friendly and nice."}
{"text":"I haven't had this great of an experience at a restaurant for a long time. I have no complaints whatsoever. Our server was attentive, our food was excellent, the food was priced well, and I was surprised especially since it was so flavorful and the presentation of it was excellent, and I really enjoyed the whole atmosphere! I will definitely be back, and will recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Decent ambience. Friendly staff. Great selection. However, my dinner was a rushed race against time. We sat down at 7:45, and salad, soup, bread, and main courses were on the table by 8:05. I personally hate when your eating your salad and your main course shows up. Give me a second to digest. I ordered soup, my wife, salad. Neither of us were close to finished and we are fast eaters. Do I let my main course cool? Do I leave my soup unfinished? 
Side note: I felt we were the only table in our section that that happened to. But geez. Pace yourselves."}
{"text":"This place sucks. The food is bland, the menu is unimaginative and the staff is clueless bordering on inept. I have tried repeatedly to 'get into' this place and I have decided to quit. There are so many options in Mt. Lebanon or the city that are way more interesting and have consistently great quality and service that I'm done bothering with this want to be chain restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Walnut Grill, but my Sister's first go. I got us a bottle of Italian Riesling to share (FYI - Wednesdays are half off bottles of wine) and started out with sharing the large Greek salad - very fresh & great dressing. 

Dinners ordered were the crab stuffed jumbo shrimp & chicken spiedini  - both were fab. We ended our meal with their vanilla creme brûlée, which is one of my personal favs. 

A big shoutout to our server, Rachel, who was awesome & I'll absolutely request to be seated in her section on my next visit!"}
{"text":"To start I was there several times love the food love the crabcakes what I don't love is a bathroom that stinks like no other.    Men's bathroom stinks so bad every time I go to I tell the manager but nothing seems to happen wow who would want to smell that stinch,beware men stay away from the Restaurants men's bathrooms .......


Restaurants clamminess gets a negative negative -100"}
{"text":"Service was slow and inattentive. Waiter appeared to know he was lost, but was not particularly apologetic about it. For example, he took our glasses to refill them and forgot to return them. Other staff worked hard to avoid eye contact. Vegetables and fruits were wilted, brown, and/or had freezer burn. Confusing to me how food in such bad shape could be sent out of the kitchen. One person's entree had hot spots and dried out parts, making us think it had been microwaved. We used to like this restaurant, but something has changed. Now I wish we had chosen to eat at the Moe's next door, where at least the food would have been fresh."}
{"text":"One thing I've come to appreciate about localized restaurant chains like Walnut Grill is that they provide a reviewer like myself a chance to try various items on their menu by going to different franchises, thereby (hee hee) racking up more Yelp reviews. I kid. Partly. 

For example, I'd been to Mount Lebanon's Walnut Grill a few times and had been meaning to try their burger, but honestly,  I generally don't like to go back to the same places over and over again. So, when I learned that a Walnut Grill had recently opened in Bridgeville, it gave me an excuse to get Kay-- who'd just returned home from a cruise-- to take a ride over with me. After all, it was my birthday, and as per tradition, she was treating.

All I wanted for my natal night meal was a fantastic burger, and WG's Classic Cheeseburger was a wish from a blown-out candle come true. Living up to its name, the patty's luscious, sophisticated, well-seasoned, freshly ground chuck/steak blend (I tasted some sirloin and perhaps ribeye)  had an ideal char on the exterior and an equally optimal mid-rare (as requested) interior. Lettuce and tomato were par for the course, but my choice of gouda (I seem to be going with that a lot of late) added a bit of twang and creamy mouthfeel. The almost artisanal bun was elegantly molded and had a texture and buttery flavor that was nearly akin to a croissant yet was surprisingly sturdy and absorbent. The fries that came with the burger were nearly flawless as well, approaching The Original Hot Dog Shop's crisp-meets-fluffy watermark but with a seasoning that vaguely smacked of Old Bay. 

Our appetizer was a bit trendier as well as more gourmet and less conventional, WG's Chicken & Brie Quesadilla proving my theory that tapas are often the most interesting dishes on any given bill of fare. Drizzled with a tart raspberry puree (I'm thinking of a certain Prince ditty from the 80's right now), the insides of the floury tortilla barely contained that nuttiest, lardiest, lustiest of cheeses as it attempted to ooze itself all over the plate and onto our fingers. Halved grapes were a uniquely sweet, crunchy, juicy twist and complimented the perfectly supple grilled chicken breast. Sour cream reined in the cilantro as best it could but not without allowing that ornery, controversial herb to make its aromatic presence known. With some kettle chips, this would make for a nice, light picnic lunch on its own. A thimble of watery salsa was also included, but sadly, it was neglected entirely.

For dessert it was the dance-hard-or-die ethos of the aptly named Chocolate Decadence Cake. Calling it \"cake\" is a misnomer as far as I am concerned. Place a piece of kitchen tissue underneath it, and stick it in a candy store's glass case, 'cause this was a thwacking wedge of absolutely malicious fudge with a star of chocolate syrup marking the middle of the plate like a pentagram scrawled in the dirt during an occult ritual in a forest. A tuft of whipped cream and a cold, wet strawberry shivered on the sidelines acting as frightened bystanders to a spectacle of purely evil confection. Mildly smoky and thicker and more saccharine than a shoofly pie, the cotter of cocoa also possessed a subtle brimstone bitterness to it that haunted my palate for hours to come. 

Suburbanites have welcomed Walnut Grill's New American swing into their community if the overflowing attendance during our visit was evidence of anything. Patrons laughed and wholesomely blew off work-week steam as they noshed on nimbly prepared food in environs that were at once homey, sports bar-ish, and discothèque-like without being exclusionary. Single, middle-aged people mingled with each other while families with small children enjoyed themselves comfortably and gaggles of twenty-something colleagues gossiped about office politics. A large group celebrating an anniversary dined across from us as a mother and her adult daughter were able to have a deep conversation over a serving of hummus. No matter which trail you take on the walk of life, Walnut Grill has a booth, stool, or table for you.

P.S. This Walnut Grill has live music and trivia nights. Check their Facebook page. 

P.P.S. The service was exceptional in every way. 

P.P.P.S. I believe Walnut Grill's menu still varies slightly depending on location, but I have not been to all of them yet."}
{"text":"Another from the local group.  Recently opened with two dining areas and a large bar.  The bar is large and has about 10 TV's. 30 beers on tap.  Looks like a good bar to go to with a group.
Ordered from the lunch entrees.  Parmesan Crusted Chicken & Gnocchi that has a tomato basil sauce with some chopped tomatoes.  The chicken was good, cooked just right with some nice taste of the Parmesan.  
Waitress was good.  The place was not real busy since it just opened recently."}
{"text":"Feels friendly and comfortable upon entering restaurant. Hostess very welcoming with big smile. Waitresses helpful and patient. Brunch was a very good variety and the food was very good. It was our second holiday brunch at this location and we would recommend going there."}
{"text":"Giving the four stars purely for the chicken spinach artichoke flatbread. It is one of my all time favorite flatbreads. It is pretty big about 8 slices and is covered in a creamy spinach artichoke dip, topped with lots of mozzarella and provolone, and bits of chicken. If you love spinach artichoke dip, then this flatbread is calling your name. Have also had the vegetarian flatbread, which was nothing special. Typically get this for take out and am always satisfied."}
{"text":"Such a good experience at Walnut Grill in Bridgeville! We went around noon for brunch and walked out an hour or so later feeling caffeinated and full to the brim of breakfast heaven. 

Our server was attentive and bubbly, helpful and heavy handed with the coffee!

I ordered the Country Breakfast Bowl with the eggs scrambled - the ham wasn't overly salted, it was a skillet and the sausage gravy was served in a bowl on the side (I couldn't finish it all, but I didn't mind).

My friend got the chicken and waffles and was very pleased - there were lots of flavors involved, mainly because of the candied jalapeños and chipotle orange maple syrup. 

At $11.99 and $12.99 I thought the prices were reasonable & I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Slow slow slow service   No concern at all from employees about the length of time to have meal served.  I sat at the bar on a quiet Thursday evening and ordered dinner and a draft beer.  The beer was warm and I waited over 45 minutes and my meal never came.  Not one employee seemed concerned that I was sitting there with no food and was never even offered bread.  I finally asked to pay for my beer and ended up leaving without eating.   I shall never return to the Walnut Grille. I asked for the manager and after another five minutes he came over.  We spoke, he offered to buy my meal and I passed, he offered to buy my next meal and I passed.  I ended up leaving without eating and will not return.  Stopped at Sonic drive thru on way home and had my dinner in the car.  At least the food was hot and quick and the drink was cold."}
{"text":"Always delicious, great service, and a nice atmosphere.  My girlfriend and I have become regulars.  We're never disappointed"}
{"text":"Decided to check the new one out in Bridgeville with a friend for dinner. Made a reservation but found the place fairly empty that it really wasn't needed.
The ceiling appears to be unfinished and now and then a \"heater\" would blow for a small time to try to warm the room.
The menu specials are misleading. They advertised a stuffed shrimp with crabmeat for only $12.00 but in actuality that was really an appetizer.
We ordered French onion soup and salads. The soup was very good. The salad I had was fair.
On the plus side we received prompt and courteous attention.
The menu appears to be overpriced so we decided not to go with the high ended dinners. Please note this is a \"chain\" restaurant. Dress is casual.
Chances are we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Place was very friendly . I made a pit stop right after arriving in Pittsburgh from Houston . I had the crab cake with a side of sweet potato . Nothing too fancy but it did the job . The service was great and so was the butter that went with the sweet potato :)"}
{"text":"My review does not stem from the service or the food.  They were certainly adequate.  However, after settling the bill $17.66, and leaving, I checked my bank account on my phone and found they had charged me $17.66 and $82.66. (My Bill was for $17.66) 
When I called the restaurant, TAD the manager could not have been more rude or arrogant. . I was told he didn't see it on his end so it wasn't true.  After nearly 30 minutes on the phone arguing my point, he found out through a call to his credit card company, I was indeed charged both of these amounts.  Upon checking with the server, he told TAD that he charged another person's bill to my card.  This was a debit account and these fund were missing from my checking account for nearly three day.  As a courtesy, TAD was to send me a gift card. This was on Tuesday, as of Saturday still no gift card.
And again, the arrogance of TAD \"well I don't know, I put it in the mail must be the post office's fault\" was his reply.
Seriously, there are many respected establishment in our city where you do NOT have to go through this type of inconvenience.  Reputable, restaurants who would not argue with you for 30 minutes, but would check, apologize, and make thing right.  Very disappointed in the very poor management of an otherwise nice restaurant
."}
{"text":"This is my third time coming to Walnut Grille. I used to go to the Mt. Lebanon location often. I can say staff was friendly and I enjoyed my loaded baked potato, but my main entree, the Parmesan crusted chicken and gnocci, was lack luster. The sauce was kind of bland and the chicken tasted fairly plain. Also, as we received our food, all three of us had our dinner come up at the same time, but our fourth friend did not receive hers until about 5-10 min later, and this went unnoticed for a very long time until we were able to alert the waitress. Food is a bit overpriced and as they do have decent happy hour deals here and there, I can't say I've had an experience that makes me want to come back for more unfortunately."}
