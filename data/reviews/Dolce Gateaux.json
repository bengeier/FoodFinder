{"text":"very good cupcakes, especially liked the nutella one and also the tiramisu one. The stuffing inside the cake is really tasty!"}
{"text":"I find cupcakes are all about the icing. I have tried many types, but never one satisfied me until....Dolce et GÃ¢teaux. It's a cute shop in place Ville Marie, with a good coffee machine. All I can say, these cupcakes are sinful but... man so delicious. The icing just melts in your mouth, and flows into my belly. The cake itself is also amazing. The perfection here is that it isn't too sweet! I have also tried their macaroons; they are addictive!!! So please enjoy them ..."}
{"text":"I've been working near the central train station this week, so I was walking past this place twice a day. After three days, I couldn't resist its charm anymore and went in. 

The place is super cute!! It has a very clean, modern interior, with a candy bar, a gelato station, a cupcake showcase, a cake fridge and plenty of sitting area. During lunchtime, it also opens up a coffee station at the shopfront, where it sells arancini (stuffed rice balls). 

It's 3.50$ per cupcake, the same price as Les Glaceurs. Not really cheap, but you do get a better price if you buy more. The selection of flavors is rather conservative, with mostly crowd pleasers (chocolate, vanilla, nutella, red velvet, etc.). I went for the chocolate and salted caramel cupcake. I think the icing was meringue-based, as it was way less sweet (thank god) than american buttercream. The cake itself was moist, with a little dollop of delicious salted caramel in the middle. Really good!

Dolce Gateaux is adorable for cute bakeries and other treats, but flavors are a bit less interesting than what you might find at other places."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the corner of Place Ville-Marie Dolce Gateaux features a small area for ordering hot drinks at the counter. The front is a very quaint, cute space with a clean, cafe feeling. There's a small sign with the daily specials each day (Monday-Friday) where the specials are $2, except for a large coffee on Wednesdays for $1.50. The baristas are very patient and really try to make your drink personalized and to your liking. 

The inside is also a very clean, quaint, almost minimalistic environment with cakes and cupcakes for sale and a small table with 4 chairs, perfect for enjoying a dessert with a cup of coffee after walking around. Off to the side, they also have a few boxes of chocolate for sale - maybe it was just for Mother's Day though, not entirely sure about that."}
{"text":"My place to go when I want coffee during the week. You'll always see a line up from people who works around the area. 
Before this place opened the coffee options were either Starbucks or the average coffees in the food court, nothing in between. Until this place opened! The coffee specials are amazing and change according to the date of the week ($2 for a latte on Mondays, $2 for cappuccino on Tuesday...) 
Staff will always smile at you no matter how busy they are.
 The deco of the place is so cute even tho is a tiny place. 
I indulge on the cupcakes or pastries once in a while and they are delicious! They also have very pretty cakes. I just love this place !"}
