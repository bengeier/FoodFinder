{"text":"I've been a regular customers of the old \"nickels\" they changed the location and kept the old staff i like their burgers and my gf seems to like their salade. sometimes the food takes 15 min to get surved etven if the restaurant is empty ,the prices are fair for saint Catherine restaurant the only downside is if you don't tip much they give you a dirty look wich make me and my gf uncomfortable"}
{"text":"J''ai lu les avis....   Un peu surpris de les lire parce que j'y étais déjà aller dans le passé.  Nous y sommes retournés.  Au menu, 2 smoke Meat de Montréal et brochettes de poulet.  La nourriture est arrivé chaude, la serveuse était polie, nous n'étions pas sous pression pour sortir du restaurant.  Nous avons aimés, en passant les smoke meat etait excellent avec de bonnes bières froides.   Bonne atmosphère et propre. En prenant en considération ce genre de restauration, ce fut à la hauteur de mes attentes.  Je ne crois pas que ce restaurant mérite un deux étoiles, mais bien trois étoiles."}
{"text":"Le service est vraiment long, on a ete servis apres 1h d'attente et 2 reflexions faites à la serveuse.
Pendant l'attente la serveuse ne venait meme pas checker si on avait besoin d'eau ou de popcorn pour patienter!

Les plats n'en valaient pas la peine non plus!.Les côtes levées etaient fades et les frites trop grasses. La seule note positive va à la salade de chou."}
{"text":"Poutine was somewhat cold, made me lose all appetitive. I got the omelette jardiniere - vegetables were over cooked, and I bit into some eggshell pieces. 
Wait staff was friendly and useful, but just from the eggs tasting somewhat like powder and the bread soggy and not crisp with light butter- I would never return."}
{"text":"Had the famous smoked meat sandwich Montreal style.  Very good, felt the effects until the next day.  Good sandwich, server once again focused to much in upselling rather than what's good at midnight."}
{"text":"******* AVOID AT ALL COST *******
PLACED ORDER AT 1:00AM---3:30AM COMES AND I GET A CALL THAT MY FOOD HAD ARRIVED... 
-the longest \"35-40 minutes\"

WOW.. I DONT KNOW WHERE TO START
First experience was overpriced steak and dry hamburger in the dark windowless restaurant. 
Would rate 6/10 comparable to a highclass mcdonalds costing about $50

This gets interesting when I had to order late night delivery.. 
Placed an order at 1am.. didnt have a choice and was interested to see if they can cater to the late-night crowd. Surprise. They cant even do that right. I recieved a call at 3:30 am saying my food was ready.. 2 hours and 30 minutes is a bucketload more time than the \"35-40 minutes\" specified on the phone.

ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN THIS DUMP.. CHEF ON CALL, MCDONALDS.. EVEN THE HALF EATEN WEEK OLD STEAK IN THE DUMPSTER."}
{"text":"Food is pretty normal Greek for white people and deli stuff. Service could go better if the bus boy didn't slack and eat pop corn. 
Time to lean time to clean"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and selected it for the lovely indoor/outdoor patio and beer special (20 oz Canadian for 4.50). I ordered the meat pie,  because I have a weakness for meat pie.  Here's what really gets me: this *could* have been a good meal. Unfortunately, rather than heating my vegetables, potatoes, and pie in the oven or over a flame as might be expected for a $14 dish, it was microwaved. A lot. The pie \"crust\" was soggy, the vegetables half disintegrating. Overall, a bit of a disappointment."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with my parents. This was the first meal in Canada for all if us and it was pretty disappointing. The service was okay, our waiter would always come over but then leave in the blink of an eye. She should be a magician. I ordered the French onion soup. That was very good! I also ordered the fish and chips; gross. The fries are thin and cheap, and served cold. Along with the fish, the crust fell off because the fish was so slimy. So overall only come here if you are really dying."}

{"text":"Avoid this place, the food was terrible the only thing that was good were the jalapeño poppers. 
The bbq chicken was very dry and didn't have any BBQ sauce AT ALL. 
The buffalo wings did not taste like buffalo and the drink were the worst, the mojito tasted like rubbing alcohol & my margarita tasted like tequila mixed with water. So bad I had to return it. 
Our server was nice though"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch and just got some poutine, which was pretty decent. Service was okay at the bar and prices were reasonable. Might be better during a Habs game or something."}
{"text":"Avoid... At all cost.
The delivery guy tried to rip us off 10$ over the bill.
They delivered 1h45 mins after the order. 
The poutines were served with igredients we didnt order.
The pizza wasn't even room temperature, it was cold."}
{"text":"We needed late night food and our hotel concierge recommended delivery from here.  What a mistake!   It took over an hour to get an old stale pizza that tasted like socks.  On top of that,  it was like 35 plus tip.  Overpriced and terrible food.   Double whammy :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a Joe's Burger, which on the menu comes with bacon, dijon and sauerkraut. The burger arrived with bacon and dijon only. After I inquired, the waitress brought me a side dish of grilled cabbage. Sauerkraut, by definition, is marinated so that it becomes, well, sour.

The waitress tried to ignore me, then finally inquired with the kitchen and said, \"This is the way we make sauerkraut.\" Which makes as much sense to me as if I'd ordered a steak, they'd brought out a meatloaf and said, \"This is the way we make steak.\"

I could live with an ignorant chef or a rude waitress, but not both at once. The waitress grudgingly asked if I'd like to order something else, but by that time the rest of my party had been eating for 10 minutes, so I just settled for a rather dry burger. Ketchup helped."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch after spending the morning walking around town. We were seated at a table outside which I always prefer. I ordered the grilled chicken Cesar wrap which came with a side salad. The wrap was tasty could've had more chicken. The best part of this dining experience was our funny and delightful server :)"}
{"text":"Food ok... The service is a little inexperienced... The worst thing is when they labelled they have wifi but it was down..."}

{"text":"The service made up for the food. It wasn't horrible- but not impressive at all. My crepe was a bit cold and over cooked. But the service was fast and friendly and the environment was cute and very clean"}
{"text":"The Westin recommended Zesto Resto as a pizza place that would deliver to the hotel, so I tried to order from them. The person who answered the phone interrupted me multiple times while I was trying to place the order, and then proceeded to tell me he had 4 lines on hold, and put me on hold because I wasn't ordering fast enough (kinda hard when you keep interrupting me). I called back until he took my order, waited 30 minutes, and then called back to inquire about an ETA on my pizza. He hung up on me 3 times before I gave up trying. 

Literally the rudest person I've ever encountered in my life. If I could give them less than one star, I would."}
{"text":"We only came here for drinks, so I can't speak for the food. They have a lot of different options and the drinks are cheap. The location is also great being right down town.  For a cheap beer, I have no problem at all with this place. They do separate checks which is great."}
{"text":"Bar was good, food was ok.  I ordered a pizza and it was very dry.  Prices seemed fair for the area.  Our waitress wasn't very attentive."}
{"text":"We are staying in a hotel close by and began to look for something to eat. We came across Zesto since it was on the main street and has a nice looking outdoor patio. 

The service was horrible throughout. We waited about 30 minutes just for our drinks to arrive. The only reason why we didn't leave is cause I had someone who was a picky eater (no... not me). So we waited. When the food came, another 15+ minutes, we didn't have any utensils or napkins for another 10 minutes. Even when we were done eating, the bill took 30 minutes. We didn't mind much because we ate and were on vacation, but it was getting annoying.

The food was okay. I had the grilled chicken pizza which was good and filling. A couple beers too.

If you're hungry and not pressed for time, sure eat here... But yea \"Meh. I've experienced better\"."}
{"text":"Place assez agréable. Menu de brunch assez divers et avec du choix. Les assiettes sont arrivées peu pleins, on avait encore faim après le repas. Le service était efficace."}
{"text":"One thing I learnt from this place is that the waiters have no idea what they're talking about and what goes on in the kitchen. 

Last time I walked by I asked the server handing flyers on the street how the ribs were cooked (smoked, grilled, baked, etc). She went in to ask the kitchen. Then I asked for how long they were smoked. And she walked back in to tell me the ribs were already cooked and all they do is reheat. A week later, I asked how long the smoke meat was being smoked, she was as clueless as always. You can call me a bully idc.

Waiter didn't know if ribs were spare ribs or baby back ribs.

So when he told me the pizza and smoke meat were well known at this restaurant, I ordered ribs and bbq chicken. 

Ribs: baby back ribs, fall off the bone tender, blablabla, accompanied by a 1/10 rib sauce. The sauce has been brushed onto the ribs after the cooking, so the flavor didn't blend in, instead it had a strong acidic taste that covered up the porkiness of the ribs. It literally killed the meat. 


BBQ Chicken: surprisingly better than Romados' chicken. The breast was juicy while the skin was not gelatinous, the chicken was well seasoned overall, but it did need a bit of the fake St-Hubert sauce to give it a boost. 

Fries: thin cut, no potato skin, had a very light color, and not very crispy. Save-able with a bit of ketchup.

Coleslaw: White mayonnaise like, wouldn't touch it even with the tip of a knife.

Bun: Half a brioche served with chicken sitting on top, so the 'jus' rendered it edible. 

Popcorn: undercooked (not joking)"}
