{"text":"Was eating in the food court beside this place after it was closed. There is a window that looks into where they prepare their food and seen a mouse climb the plug wire onto the table. Won't be trying this place anytime soon or any of the places in gare centrale."}
{"text":"They're located in the Bonaventure train station, so it can get really busy during breakfast and lunch hours. I normally go here for lunch since I work in the tower next door.

I love their selection of food - mainly because they prepare everything in front of you. I usually get their omelettes, club sandwiches, pannini's and salads. They are well-priced for the amount of food you get as well.

The do need an upgrade to the seating areas that are around the restaurant. I've never sat down to eat here because it feels kind of run down in the sitting area.

Overall, I would recommend this place to those who work in the area / travelling through Montreal."}
{"text":"Location: In central station. If you're using transit then Bonaventure is the closest subway stop unless you're on the green line - then you can get off at McGill and walk over. Street parking is hit or miss in these parts, though there's indoor parking - that'll probably cost you an arm (or a leg).

The place: If you skip breakfast, then this is the perfect place to stop in at. They have a ton of breakfast options - from bacon and eggs to waffles. It's pretty simple fare . If you just want toast, a bagel, a slice of banana bread, juice - or a banana, apple or orange - they've got you covered.  Oh, and they've got coffee but I don't know if it's any good. 

The goods: I've had full breakfasts here and I've always been very satisfied. They prepare everything right in front of you so you know sh*t is fresh. I've also popped in to grab random fruit or just a quick bagel. Really can't complain from a price/quality point of view, or the location. 

Service: Friendly.

Price point: I don't remember the cost of breakfast but I'm pretty sure it's under $10 depending on what you get."}
{"text":"I was in here to pick up some lunch before boarding the train.  It's very conveniently located in the gare central.  They seem to have a good selection of hot and cold items, although not everything was open on the weekend when I was there.  I took a selection of salads from the bar, there was quite a good selection and they were pretty tasty.  Salad bar is priced by weight, and a modest selection cost $15, which I found a little on the expensive side.  I took a few pictures to include in the review but got a very stern lecture from the cashier about the restaurant being \"private property\" and I shouldn't be taking pictures of it.  So no photos to go with this review, alas..."}
{"text":"We stopped for breakfast and were impressed with the the variety, freshness and speedy preparation. Very friendly people and a most pleasant surprise.  A great unpretentious breakfast or lunch spot."}
{"text":"Salads, soups, sandwiches, paninis,  and various hot dishes to eat there or take out; all laid out as to hot or cold,  Vegetarian friendly, comparatively-priced fare. Good for those on the run."}
{"text":"Bel endroit, bonne variété. Repas chaud, buffet salade, coin casse-croûte, déjeuners, collations, boissons, café et thé. Produits dérivés. Le service est toujours sympa aussi. Pour un repas rapide, c'est l'idéal."}
{"text":"Walk in.  Keep walking to the back where they best burger in town.  The place is fresh, clean and filled with excellent serve-yourself drinks and salads. Yum."}
{"text":"I've become a fan of this place far from my home back in Dallas, Texas...at times it reminds me of home when they cook a breakfast for me early in the morning.  Not because of the location...but, because they actually seem to care about what they serve their clients which is a quality home styled cooked meal..., and that's why it reminds me of home at times.  So, if you're at the the Train Station...stop by and give them a visit prior to going on your voyage.  :)"}
{"text":"At the train station in Montreal underground,  yep underneath the Queen Ann Hotel enjoying breakfast  with my wife before boarding to go back to the states."}
{"text":"Stopped in this place for breakfast after arriving in Montreal early in the morning.

This place has quite a hefty supply of breakfast options, ranging from omelettes, sandwiches, salads, paninis, etc. In fact, it somewhat reminds me of Marché in Toronto.

I went for the omelette with brown bread. It was okay, however my omelette had a lot more green peppers than ham, and I'm not a huge fan of green peppers. The brown bread tasted quite good.

Considering I paid about $8.50 for this after tax, I can't really complain (omelettes cost about $10 alone). It's a good place for a quick breakfast if you need to catch a train or just are out of ideas on where to eat."}
{"text":"Pas si mal, un peu cher mais acceptable. Un peu comme une caféteria assez santé dans l'ensemble avec des jus maisons. Ça me fait penser à un Movenpick (dans le temps). Ma patrone m'a offert un jus de fruit, j'étais venu ici une fois auparavant manger un sandwich, pas si pas. Rien de wow mais je comprends pourquoi ça fonctionne bien: c'est un bon menu pour les voyageurs et vraiment une bonne place pour la personne pressée.

Not so bad, a bit expensive but acceptable. A Little bit like a classy, kinda green and healthy in general with some nice home made juice. My boss bought me a juice, loved it! I had came here in the pass to have a sandwich and it wasn'T wow, but still pretty ok. Good for a quick lunch with some ok options for travelers (as it's in the Halle de la Gare)"}
