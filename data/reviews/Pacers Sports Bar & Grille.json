{"text":"I've been to Pacers in Mentor and love the food!!  So far I've tried a burger and the barbecue chicken.  Both were so good I can't wait to go back!  The burger was the best burger I've ever had, and the barbecue sauce is the original Pacers sauce.  They also have the original Pacers chef cooking there!!  I highly recommend eatting at Pacers whenever you're hungry!!!!"}
{"text":"Not that great prices 25% higher than online menu . Ribs on a 1to 10  4 service 4 ambiance 3 backed beans 0 iced tea was water. No selection of BBQ sauces would not go back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and it is ok.  The food is really pretty standard bar, nothing special.  I tried the ribs and they were not really very good, the wings were up to snuff, but not especially good.  It has a pretty nice bar and the staff is friendly and attentive.  If your looking for a bar in mentor that is not a dive, this is yet another addition to the milk toast world that  we live in.  At least it is a local chain and not another fast food joint."}
{"text":"Well they now are open in mentor. Food is about the same as their Euclid location prices are little up there but the food is good not great but good. The location has had some updating since the last place was in here.  Staff was friendly and prompt so i hope they last at this location. The last 3-4 places had a rough go. Stop in and try them out Pacers has been around a very long time."}
{"text":"Arrived @ 6:30 pm on a Sunday evening. We were promptly greeted by the hostess & requested patio seating. The table was a bit grimy from the traffic but our server promptly cleaned it upon request. Though the patio borders Mentor Ave., the traffic noise was not as bad as I anticipated. I did forget that outdoor dining still permits patrons to smoke.  Our beverages were quickly served & I ordered a cup of gumbo for an appetizer which was very good. My dinner consisted of the 8 oz. sirloin steak, home fries, & baked beans. The steak was tender though on the rare side of medium as I had ordered. The serving of home fries was huge but nearly had too much seasoning. The baked beans were average.  Service was very good throughout our meal and the price point was excellent. ________________  Follow-up to my original review:   I received a message from the management thanking me for my 4-star rating & requesting I return to provide the opportunity for Pacers to earn a 5-star rating. In my opinion, this tells me Pacers has a GREAT CUSTOMER-FOCUSED ATTITUDE which seems to be lacking at most businesses today. I certainly WILL return & encourage my fellow Yelpers to try Pacers for this reason alone to form your own opinion."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Slow service and marginal food.  I was excited to try ribs, but they were a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Tried them tonight for the first time. Great feel and service. Had their new sauce wings 5 garlic Parmesan and5 super hot. They were good. My son had 15 hot and enjoyed them as well. Waitress was kind and attentive. I would definitely go back. Nice to have a goto place close by"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time owner is only interested in taking care of his friends. Queen of hearts drawing here 3 hours prior to have dinner half of the tables empty but you can't be seated.  Saving for the people that have been here every week.  Is this a restaurant?  I think not!!"}
{"text":"Been going to their other locations for years and happy they opened in Mentor. Went for lunch and was not disappointed. Good food with nice ambiance and good service. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I came here for a late lunch on a Friday around 345. The place wasn't too busy but trust me it started to fill up quickly. This seems to be a hangout for the regular locals. Immediately a good sign, I like those places.  I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by the bartender Mary, who was such a delight! It was below 20 degrees outside but she made me feel so warm and welcomed there. You don't see that too often. Thank you Mary!! I ordered the big triple burger which has bacon Swiss and mushrooms. I added grilled onions. Omgggg one of the best burgers I've had!! It was cooked to my liking medium rare. I Love that they use brioche buns and not seed buns or kaiser rolls as I'm not a fan. The sweet potato fries are very good too. Thicker cut with the right amount of crisp! No soggy limpy fries here . My food came out so quickly which is a bonus because I was starving. I plan to be back soon and frequently. So glad to have a nice bar and grille closer to my hometown with great food for great prices!!"}
{"text":"Happy to see Mentor has a new restaurant that's not another corporate chain. Had the ribs & mac n cheese, really great comfort food! Have a nice size beer list and happy hour. Ton of tv's, I see Cav's watch parties in my future...highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It just opened 2 weeks ago and is a great addition to Lake County dining.  It has the same delicious barbecue food at reasonable prices.  Service was friendly and good.  This is a place that deserves repeat visits."}
{"text":"Tried this place out this afternoon and had a great experience! The menu isn't very big, so not really a restaurant destination,  but it's a nice sports bar where you can grab something good to eat. There are burgers, pizzas, sandwiches and appetizers. There were 16 beers on tap and about half of them were craft with a few that change seasonally. There was a good selection of spirits including flavored whiskeys and vodkas. I was VERY impressed with the number of TVs. There's not a seat in the house without a view. The atmosphere was comfortable casual and the staff extremely friendly and talkative. We ordered a total of 6 rocks pour whiskeys, an order of 10 garlic parm wings and a beer cheese burger with fresh cut fries. The bill came to $49 with tax. I think the pricing is just right. The burger was on special as on all Mondays. It came out cooked to order at medium with a slight pink center. We ordered a side of their house BBQ sauce to add to the burger and the whole thing was FABULOUS! The fries were nothing to write home about... but weren't bad. The wings were large, meaty and juicy. The skin had a slight crisp on some parts, a little more crispness would have been preferred, but they were definitely good. The sauce was a bit butter heavy, but deliciously flavorful. This place is close to home for us and I hope they are able to be successful at this location. They've only been open 3 weeks. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice draft selection. Have the shock top pretzel beer on tap- which is a big plus. Wings are solid. Have tried the garlic parm and Asian Chili- both tasty. The Asian Chili has a nice balance of heat and sweet. Service is great. TVs everywhere- any seat has a good view of a tv. Good place to watch a game. This place is located in the spot previously occupied by the Avenue and then Cabanas. In nice weather, the patio will be fun."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on 12/17 before heading downtown for a concert. My daughter had the rib tips and sweet potato fries-she said both were good. I had a rack of baby back ribs -they were good too. Sauce was flavorful....although ribs weren't as meaty as I like. Coleslaw was creamy and the baked potato I had was also tasty. Our waitress was attentive and took care of our needs promptly.  Will return -glad there's still a rib place around since Damon's and Burgers N Beer no longer exists."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight. Used to frequent the one in Euclid 20 years ago, so was excited to order their wings to see if it's what we remembered.   Not much has changed as far as the decor from what was previously the Avenue.  Not a bad thing - sometimes you just like to get a new feel to an old place that was quite popular. Service was exceptional - even the manager was attentive making two stops to our table to see how things were.  A+ in that department.   For appetizers we ordered (10) garlic parm wings (extra crispy) and chili cheese fries. Wings were good, but not as much garlic parm as we like. Others might like them that way, so it's a matter of preference. Fries were good, but chili was thick and heavy w beans. Again, matter of preference, but was too thick for our liking. Wouldn't order those again. We decided not to order burgers and instead got the wing/rib appetizer combo. This time was teriyaki wings and they were good. Ribs were also good (sauce was excellent). Not the best wings or ribs we've had, but no complaints.   Overall, typical bar food with excellent service. Probably wouldn't make a special trip to go back unless it was just out of convenience. I hope they do well in their new location."}
{"text":"Wanted to like it -- service was good, friendly. Food was marginal. We both had baby back ribs -- since this is a ribs place, after all. Expecting meat that fell off the bone... what we got was dry and fatty. Small amount of sauce on top, but was tasty . Sides were good. Also, oddly, a guy in hoodie and shorts stopped by and asked how we were doing . It occurred to us later that maybe this was the manager (?). If so, perhaps grown up clothes (or at least a Pacers shirt) , a brief self introduction and a relevant question regarding food would have helped. That said, we'll try again..but not the ribs."}
{"text":"I actually love this place, the outside patio is nice in the summer and the steak salad is delish and decently priced!"}
{"text":"I didn't eat the food, we were just there to see a band Saturday night. So review based solely on that. Hostess very nice, service decent (they were busy), drink selection decent. Clean, band was good. Older crowd."}
{"text":"Made reservations ahead but when we arrived there was still a 30 minute wait.  Ribs were very chewy, not good at all.  Both of us left more on our plate than we ate.  Can't recommend, maybe the pulled pork would be better."}
{"text":"Food is good, beer is cold and the TVs are in abundance. Great place to bring the family and enjoy the game at the same time! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is mediocre. Was disappointed in the ribs I got. Service was okay. Nothing about it made me want to go back unfortunately."}
