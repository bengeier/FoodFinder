{"text":"For what this place is, it's amazing. The Banh Mi is better at other places, but the Baos, squid taco, grilled chicken papaya salad and the kimchi fries are unique items that set Banh Mi Boys apart. Try the secret menu \"Club Bao\" (with pork belly & fried chicken). Staff are always high energy and the vibe is good. (There seems to be a West Coast hip hop bias here though, I'm more of an East Coast guy but whatever) If you live or work in urban Toronto this is a place you should frequent often."}
{"text":"Go and try it - the food is delicious, you won't be disappointed.    That said - it's Banh Mi.  Go to any mom and pop Banh Mi shop in the city and the sandwich is $2-3 tax included.  Here it will set you back $8-10.  My 4 stars is for the pricing of what in Vietnam is a humbling and cost friendly experience of cross cultural fusion.  At BMB it's just a little too pretentious for my taste.  Everything is delicious, but you're paying for an environ designed to cater to the Western consumer.  I suppose you cannot blame them for their business sense, but it just rings off inauthentic.   Amazing kimchi fries, even if it's a day's worth of calories in a bowl- you gotta get those.  Don't get it as a side on your own unless you are morbidly obese or like to throw away food."}
{"text":"I visited BMB on a Thursday evening with friends. We asked the girl at the counter for 1 fried chicken bao, 1 pork belly bao and 1 kimchi fries. I asked to confirm whether the kimchi fries can come with tofu instead of meat and the girl snapped at my friend and I to an unacceptable level. She was rude and hostile only because we did not CLARIFY that we wanted \"tofu kimchi\" because apparently regular \"kimchi\" means it comes with meat. She ripped out the order and started pointing at it and saying \"YOU ORDERED 3 THINGS AND YOU NEVER SAID BLA BLA BLA\" and my friend had to tell her \"sweety calm down...its ok\".   Terrible attitude. Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"good sandwiches! try the lemongrass one its good spicy but don't plan on kissing anyone after.  Service is fast even though they're really busy most of the time."}
{"text":"The go to place for late night studying at the slc. The banh mi always taste great and the service is fast."}
{"text":"First time having banh mi, even though I eat a lot of vietnamese food.  This place is amazing, and I dunno what it was like before the recent reno, but I'm pleasantly surprised.  I got the kimchi fries (hallyu is still pretty strong in me) & a grilled chicken banh mi. So good!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of the original Spadina & Queen location. Loving that it's the same menu at both locations. Items that I've tried at both seem consistent and amazing.  Definitely get their squid taco. Amazing!  Seating's obv limited, but me and 2 friends were able to commandeer a table on a busy week night. Seems almost like a ditto copy of the original location, which is pretty hard to do and I give the owners huge props for that."}
{"text":"Best lunch ever.  I have this at least once every two weeks and I've never had a bad meal here.  Don't be discouraged by the long line. These guys bang out orders like they're on the coco and they're always swamped with customers. You won't regret it.  Kimchi fries are good enough for a meal I'd say. Very filling but amazing. Although you have to eat them hot and as soon as possible. Once they sit out and get old they get mushy and cold and heavy and the fries get dried out and you'll want to throw them on the ground.  Any of the banh mis are killer, but thats a meal in itself as well. Kalbi beef tacos, fried chicken baos, five spice pork belly baos, kimchi fries and five spice pork belly banh mis are always my go tos."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is solid. It's Burger Priest solid. And by that, I mean it's a place you can go for lunch or dinner and not have to worry about making the wrong choice. Ingredients are always fresh and they're very consistent with the food they put out. I've tried probably 75% of the meats on the menu in various forms (tacos, buns, banh mi) and have not been disappointed. When you have more than one favorite on the menu you know it's a good spot.  My go-to is still the pork belly banh mi but I have recently fallen in love with the kalbi beef and squid.  Go. You won't be disappointed.  Protip: They have an In-N-Out style policy with their menu and let you get creative with customizations. Want Kimchi on your pork belly? No problem. Onion Chutney on your squid? No Problem. Mayo on everything? No problem."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good sandwiches. I love the tofu lemongrass! Staff are nice and the old school hip hop music makes me dance!"}
{"text":"New location but I always go to the gerrard location.   But since the is around my office I come here more often.   I alqays get the  five spice pork belly.  Nice Flavourful meat.   I tired the duck confit on my most recent visit .  It is a not Thier strength when you compare it the the pork belly or REAL confit which is biased in duck fat for three hours.    Good kim chi fries  And the lineup and wait is very long.  I go after 1:30  when it gets more quiet."}
{"text":"Kimchi poutine!  Poutine is pretty awesome already, but the combination of kimchi, mayo and starch does amazing things to your taste buds. I'd go for this menu item alone.   The bao's are ok, pulled pork or duck is the best.   Their banh mi's are decent, but if you want the real deal, go to Chinatown. I can't justify paying more for a bastardized version of banh mi."}
{"text":"Kimchi Fries were awesome! Sandwiches were delicious too. I prefer this location to the Yonge location, better quality too."}
{"text":"Really good food! Been here a few times. The kimchi fries are so good, as is the pork or chicken buns. Sometimes the line-up or wait can be long but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I tried the pulled port sandwich, it was good, but wasn't AMAZING. Not sure about the hype..."}
{"text":"LOVED.  what more to say than what's been already said? NOM NOM.  - kalbi taco and banh mi are delish - yes to kimchi fries!!! - 5 spice pork belly bao was ok - love that two people can get full for less than $20 - SO WORTH IT"}
{"text":"Delicious! Love their tofu tacos - lots of bright, colorful veggies. They tend to put an excessive amount of mayo, though."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something you don't know. If you haven't been to Banh Mi Boys, you deserve a  reminder that only the purity and innocence of their sandwiches can bring you peace.   Let me explain... Their five spice pork belly hit me hard with an enormous and rigid state of wood in desperate need of a morning romp. Their Kimchi fries, three pints of blood rushed to my loins. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Addicted to this place. I definitely enjoy these versions over the \"authentic\" banh mi everyone seems to be comparing these to (which are not but I'll try not to get snide). Pork belly is definitely my favourite and go-to but since I've tried the beef cheek and the squid, too, which are both excellent.  A few things... seriously, Subway sanwiches and $2 banh mi's? I am not sure if you really get the concept. Think it's too expensive? Just stick to the crappier (mind you I still think what some of you consider \"authentic\" banh mi's pretty tasty) $2 banh mi's. If you like subway better... well, I won't even go there but different strokes for different folks, I guess.  I think these guys do an excellent job of making these fusion sandwiches. I guess I do end up comparing the food out here with the food I used to get back home in Vancouver in terms of quality and price - maybe it's not so fair given the differences in economy of the two cities - but the bottom line is under $7 for these sandwiches are an excellent deal."}
{"text":"Loved it! I think next time I go I would get the bahn mi instead of the bao only because the steamed bun, although delicious sticks to your teeth!"}
{"text":"Simple - Cheap - Flavourful  Tried them all and the best flavour profile and texture Is there initial offereing the pork Bahn Mi - it's perfect - Siracha Mayo - Cilantro and Crusty French Bread  The KimChi Poutine is a little too top heavy  One of the best streetfoods of toronto"}
{"text":"I'vve been here a few times and had an amazing, quick and cheap meal each time! The duck confit salad is a nice blend of asian and euro flavours, and at under $10, it's a great healthy meal. The galbi and beef cheek Banh Mi sandwiches are also really yummy: a bit of spice and some really unique flavours that work together great. I always do takeaway, the food stays fresh and salads crisp for my 20 minute walk home. I would totally recommend this for a quick pick-up dinner when you're in a rush or just craving something asian :)"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and am always impressed. The ingredients are fresh, the menu is well-developed and the price is right!   You simply must try each variation of the steamed bao. The flavours work together wonderfully and the crunch of the veggies contrasts well with the soft steamed bun. For a unique (and calorie-rich) treat, try the kimchi fries. If you want something light and refreshing, get the jicama papaya salad. You can also get an entree salad that has chicken or duck confit.   Of course, you can't go to a place called Banh Mi Boys without trying the banh mi! These Vietnamese sandwiches are flavourful and filling.  The restaurant itself is quite small and has a casual diner feel. There isn't much seating space, but most people seem to take their food out anyway since the banh mi are perfect snacks for eating on the go."}
{"text":"I love their Kimchi fries, that alone constitutes as its own meal. There Banh mi subs are flavourful, served steaming hot and their bread fresh. You really get the most for your money, meals average out what you'd probably spend on a Subway meal or Mc Donald's, but it's a million times better than going to a chain resto. They have limited seating so get ready to take it to a stoop and eat it there, lines can be long during lunch from the work crowd so hitting them up a little earlier than 12pm can make all the difference. Service is fast, efficient, polite, can't ask for more such a high volume to-go setting."}
{"text":"Been here several times and even recommended this place to my friends and they all love it! The food is consistent, cashier is always polite and wait time is reasonable. Highly recommend the kimchi fries and for vegetarians the panko crust tofu bao is delicious!"}
{"text":"Hurts me to do this - I'm sure it was just a fluke but today my fried chicken was legitimately burnt and the wrap to my taco was beyond stale, it was so hard it wouldn't fold. Really disappointing lunch experience.  Who am I kidding though, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Dropped by for the first time today for some take out lunch after morning errands. It's a tiny little place just off of Queen and Spadina and it was packed to the rafters. Immediately inside there is a small eat in area then towards the back is the kitchen and cashier area. There was a bit of a line up but I was impressed with how quickly and efficiently the staff took our orders while remaining courteous and friendly. I was initially not going to get anything to drink but I saw they had cans of Vanilla Coke (as well as Cherry Coke) and since I'm sucker for it, I quickly grabbed it. I decided to order the grilled chicken Banh Mi sandwich and a side order of the kimchi fries. They took my name and I waited across from the kitchen line for my order.   While I waited with about 6 or 7 other customers, it was really nice to see the staff lightly bantering with each other while  working on their orders. There were a little over half a dozen young employees packed into the small kitchen and they all seemed to be enjoying themselves. So often when I get quote-unquote \"fast food\", the staff seems miserable (which I don't blame them for) but these guys were bright eyed and bushy tailed for such a busy place. BTW: There was a notice that they were hiring if anyone is interested. There was also a helpful poster displaying the range of spiciness, from mild (no spice) to medium (siracha sauce) to hot (siracha with jalapeno peppers) and very hot (habanero peppers).   It only took maybe ten minutes before my name was called (and about four or five people were called before me). She asked me what spiciness I wanted, and I opted for medium. She quickly finished the last touches on the meal and then wrapped it up in a paper bag and gave it to me with a quick smile. The whole thing: sandwich, fries and coke cost me $15.25.   Now for the taste: The grilled chicken sandwich was wonderful. The perfect sandwich size for me with slightly picked carrots and cucumber. The grilled chicken marinade really makes it special and elevates it from being a plain jane chicken sandwich. It was more than enough for me on its own. Buy the time I was finished, I had almost no room for the fries.  I did have a couple bites of the fries before I packed it and saved it for later. SO GOOD. I normally don't eat poutine because of the greasy heaviness, but this was to die for. I wish I had enough room in my stomach to eat it all. If you are only going to have one item to start with, I suggest this one. It has all the decadent goodness of cheese, pulled pork, kimchi and the fries remain intact but drenched with all the packed in flavour. The spiciness was also perfect for me, as I like a bit of a kick but not too much.  This will definitely become a regular take out destination for me, although from now on I know that ordering one sandwich is more than enough for me to eat. Too bad, I'm a little out of the area. It would be great if they brought a location to Parkdale/Roncy/High Park area. Give it a try if you haven't already. There are a couple locations throughout the city."}
{"text":"During lunch, the lines there are insane and you end up waiting half and hour for the food, but even when people walk in and are shocked by the length of the line, nobody leaves. They just mutter bitterly to themselves or just start a conversation with each other of their crazy long line experiences.   I'm a vegetarian so I had the Kimchi Fries and the Tofu Banh Mi...Both were fantastic but the Kimchi Fries was ESPEcially tasty. Even my friends with the Chicken and Porkbelly sandwiches agreed they enjoyed the Kimchi more. Not saying that the sandwiches were bad, but it's that the fries are that good."}
{"text":"My friend and I call the kimchi fries 'crack fries' and have gone back three weekends in a row to get our fix."}
{"text":"I love this place.  So busy at lunch; very hard to get a seat.  I try to go around 11:45am to beat the crowds b/c the line can be out the door during lunch rush.  Food is excellent.  Service is good.  Pricing is fair.  Go with a friend - order a bao each and share kamchi fries; you'll be full and satisfied."}
{"text":"My favorite bao in the city!!! try the fired chicken and the pork belly ones, to die for! the only down side is probably the line up..."}
{"text":"I always order a braised beef steam bao and i don't regret it. Not expensive. Tasty (just wish there was a bit more carrots in it) Very busy and popular place. Not a lot of seating places but I recommend it."}
{"text":"pretty good! but i prefer my viet buns ;)"}
{"text":"I salivate at the mere thought of the five-spice pork belly bao. Pulled pork banh mi is also great according to my friend, and kimchi fries are real legit."}
{"text":"Best sandwich I've had in a loooonnnng time. Steamed bao with pulled pork, carrots, pickles and cilantro, medium spicy.  Place was hopping busy, even though it was in between lunch and dinner, so I ordered it to go.  Service was fast - order was up in less than 2 minutes.  Lucky I hadn't eaten it there or I would have been back at the counter ordering more.  Will definitely be back to try the squid tacos."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. There is no flavour and you're basically just eating bread. Not bad, but not good."}
{"text":"Not bad, not vacation food worthy. Kimchi fries are a gimmick. Kalbi sandwich and pork sandwich taste the same. Meal was decent, but not something I go to again if I was visiting the toronto area again."}
{"text":"Yummy food that's decently priced. I've visited the location near Yonge & College."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches in Toronto. Everything is amazing, the Baos, tacos, and banh mis. I am not sure I can pick favourites. Highlights are the chicken or tofu baos and the beef taco. Great flavour and value. Line moves quickly."}
{"text":"This place is alright. I had huge expectations because there was a lot of hype around the pork belly sub. I learned after having it that I'm not a fan of such a fatty meat. The kimchi fries are undeniably something you need to try if you've never been before!"}
{"text":"We always enjoy everything we've ever ordered at Banh Mi Boys. How they keep it so reasonable and fresh each and everytime is wonderful and will keep me coming back anytime I am in Toronto!  Now the It's a Bao Time which is a take on Banh Mi Boys IMO can take note that it will never catch up. There is always a line up to place your order. Don't be discouraged by the small premises and with just a few seats along the wall and along the order area and the few tables in the front part of the restaurant, we are always able to get a table within a few minutes of getting our food."}
{"text":"Pork belly, as the best of all the bellies, makes for a fine sandwich. Plentiful and very delicious, and cheap at twice the price. Get there at least 20 minutes before noon to avoid a totally-worth-it lineup."}
{"text":"This is my snack place, not really my meal place. Portions are delicious but smallish for my rather large appetite. My favorites are pork belly sandwiches and the kimchi fries. Be prepared to wait, but will just mean the food tastes better when it finally gets past your lips!"}
{"text":"Love it. Tofu fries & all the sandwiches rock!"}
{"text":"Killer. Went here for the first time today on a recommendation and was blown away! Go. Just trust me, go now - order the chicken steamed bao, you won't regret it. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"first visit had the pork belly  and the Kim chi fries  I asked for both of them spicy. The pork belly was  very tasty , the Kim chi fries, their version of poutine,  had  shredded meat in it,  interesting but I probably would not order it again.  When I go back I will  order  everything spicy hot."}
{"text":"Quite expensive for the bun or a baguette but it is  delicious...definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"For take out and eat in, it is gourmet fast food.  I would go all out with the bau buns, rank the taco's 2nd and the sandwiches 3rd.  The bau buns are at least twice the size of the Momofuku ones and probably more delicious.  Kimchi fries all the way.  This place is a freakin hit!"}
{"text":"Last week I went there with the friend ate kimchi fries,taste was really good. That's why came back again to try another food on today.  I choose spice pork belly steamed bao, the cashier girls even recommended, but very disappointed, the pork belly is hard ,not juicy and soft at all, not taste. The one name of 'mean bao' make much better than here. But the Kimchi Fries was good. I think I will not go back again. Because those cashier girls service was not good either in both my visit experience. Bad services."}
{"text":"I expected more from the kimchi poutine than just kimchi on top of fries, but it was tasty and for the price, it was loaded."}
{"text":"I don't think you can find any better korean tacos in the city. The kalbi beef tacos never fail. They are juicy and delicious. I'm not a huge vegetarian fan but the veg kimchi fries and tofu tacos are amazing.  I had never tried the Bao before but now I love them, they taste fresh and just the right size for a quick bite.  The sandwiches are great too, the portions are just right and fairly cheap. I love this place and would recommend it for a quick lunch if you're in the area.  It gets pretty busy there so your're not guaranteed a seat especially if there are more than two eating in."}
{"text":"I was reluctant to try Banh Mi Boys at first because you can get the Vietnamese sandwiches in Chinatown for $2.50.  I thought Banh Mi Boys' fusion version of this Vietnamese sandwich would just be basically the classic Vietnamese bun + fusion toppings.  My friend took me here and I have to agree, the sandwiches are a lot better than the classic versions!  I had the Kalbi Beef Banh Mi and it was delicious.  I would go back but it's always packed!"}
{"text":"What is there to say about this place? Except that it's awesome food at an incredible price. I need my hit of the chicken banh mi every week!   It's filled with flavour and the slaw? OMG- I could just eat the slaw on it's own as a side! The chicken is tender and moist, the sauce is perfect. I wish I knew what was in it and the bun...oh the bun. Perfect, warm and toasted.  Don't change a thing..including the price!"}
{"text":"Kimchi fries is indeed the star of this place! Large portion and good price. Gonna try some pork belly next time:P"}
{"text":"Not particularly a sandwich person, but this place has changed that! So glad I have discovered a delicious place to eat near my work. Banh Mi Boys is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, delicious. What else could you want?   A friend and I split two bahn mi sandwiches (pork belly and one beef) and the sweet potato fries. Staff were friendly and helpful and it's even got a few seats to sit at.    Also, the have Vanilla Coke which is AMAZING since I can't seem to find it many places in the city.   Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Forget the Banh-Mi here, the Kimchi fries are where its at! Incredibly delicious, mixture of fries, gravy and kimchi and pulled pork. What a combo! Very savoury and highly addictive. Definitely worth going to over and over again."}
{"text":"Kimchi fries - tasty toppings but the fries were pretty brown/overly well done and didn't survive a few minutes' walk as takeout  Pork belly banh mi - very good, nice crispy vegetables and tasty pork belly  Pork belly bao - definitely the star, good balance of the vegetables and meat to the soft bao"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's quick, cheap, and yummy! I love viet subs to begin with, and this place puts a delicious spin on banh mi. I got a kalbi beef taco, my friend got the beef cheek banh mi, and we got kimchi fries to share.  I was really skeptical about the kimchi fries when I first got it. I don't like mayo to begin with and I couldn't imagine kimchi (so korean) and french fries (so western) going well together. But I was so wrong! The combination of fries, kimchi, spicy mayo, pulled pork, and green onions went so well together. I basically licked the bottom of the box cause I couldn't get enough.  The kalbi beef taco was very flavourful and pretty filling, considering I only got one. The meat was kind of chewy, but it's kind of expected since the beef is from the kalbi rib, and you're kind of eating the tendon part that wraps around the bone.  The banh mi was really good as well. The bread was fresh and soft and the pickled veggies were crisp. I think the meat was a bit old, because it had a hint of flavour that reminded us of beef jerky... which implied that it might have been sitting around for a while. Maybe next time we'll try another meat filling.  The only downside to this place that it is pretty small and there's not much seating."}
{"text":"Great excuse to go to Toronto!  Make a stop every time for the Chicken Bahn Mi and Kimchi fries."}
{"text":"I recently visited Banh Mi Boys again, and I was left feeling disappointed.   It was last Wednesday evening around 5:30 that I dined here with my friends. It appears to remain quite popular, particularly for take-out orders.  Since it had been some time since my previous visit, I wanted to eat Kimchi Fries and a Five Spice Pork Belly Steamed Bao again.   The only complaint I have about the Kimchi Fries was the very small amount of kimchi that laid on top of the fries.   My biggest letdown was the bao. \"The bun is always soft, and tastes hot-out-of-the-oven fresh\" is what I mentioned in my first review last May. Unfortunately, the one I had last Wednesday was the total opposite! I was surprised because the restaurant was far from busy when we first arrived and placed our orders, so there was no apparent reason for them to be rushing our orders and serving cold baos. Unless...this is how they serve them now? I really hope not because those soft, hot-out-of-the-oven fresh buns (with pork belly, especially) were delicious."}
{"text":"Banh mi Boys makes some incredibly tasty sandwiches.  I'm not a fan of the asian white buns, so I have never tried those.  However, the banh mi and the kimchee fries are really tasty.    Banh mi Boys does a high-quality spin on the classic Banh mi (vietnamese buns). They create pork belly, chicken or pulled pork banh mi sandwiches with fresh veggies that are very delicious.  The best is the kimchee fries.  If you cannot handle spicy, ask for it to be mild. If you almost never have spicy food but can handle a tiny bit of heat, get medium and mix the kimchee, meat and the fries in together.    There isn't a lot of seating.  What little seating they have is cafeteria style and a couple of stools at the cashier/bar.  You don't have to wait long for food, which is great, but if you want to sit and enjoy your meal, available seating is a hit or miss."}
{"text":"it was good, but not as great as everyone says.  i like Ginger much better and the price is better also."}
{"text":"This place is just incredible, and so close to the heart of Queen & Spadina that I'm suprised it took me two years to know about it.  I had the chicken sandwich and their only salad option - it came to about 10 bucks, and I must say was the best $10 I've spent on lunch near my office in months.  Incredibly delicious, big line ups but very fast service. If you're a spice fan, you'll get to request your heat level from the friendly meal craftspeople. Best of all, the food is fresh and healthy, nothing like the greasy other options in the area."}
{"text":"As a vietnamese food addict, I was excited to try Banh Mi Boys,  Overall the food was good and cheap.  I ordered the grilled pork sandwich, it was everything I wanted until I said yes to the \"habanero peppers\"  It turned my sandwich from heaven, to a an inedible fireball.  The tofu fries are also misleading, the name suggest fries made out of tofu.  In reality it was soggey fries oozing with large tofu chunks? I let my boyfriend eat that, he's a bottomless pit.  Overall would come back again and hopefully learn from my mistakes."}
{"text":"When you first enter you know you've entered a establishment that has a Korean grill. Once you open the door it immediately smells like smoked meat, and you can see a cloud of smoke coming from the back where the grill is. Needless to say I ended up smelling like barbecue after, but this was a small price to pay for the food that we  had.   Kimchi Fries ($5.99) -- First up, Kimchi Fries. Whoever came up with this idea is a genius. I wasn't too appetized at the combination initially, but the combination of vinegary kimchi, sweet hoisin sauce, tangy mayo, savory pulled pork, and cheese, over a bed of crunchy hot fries would quickly banish any doubt. Its a big portion, but the four of us finished it without a problem.   Braised Beef Cheek Steamed Bao ($3.49) -served with cucumber, pickled carrots, and cilantro -- The steamed bun ended up being a bit sticky from the condensation as a result of all the attention we gave the Kimichi Fries. But if you can look past that or resist the urge to neglect it over the other items, this was a great order. The beef cheek is really tender, and it quickly melts together with the soft steamed bun. I think I prefer the steamed buns at Swish By Han more, but these are a good alternative when you just want to grab and go.   Kalbi Beef Taco ($3.99) - served with purple cabbag slaw, kimchi, pickled carrots, and cilantro -- Starting off with a chinese pancake, it is topped by a mound of intensely marinated beef, and its companion toppings. It's a deliciuos combination, and I love the slight chewiness of the pancake \"tortilla\". But be warned --it will be a lot of dripping sauce, and spillage of overflowing ingredients!   Five Spice Pork Belly Banh Mi ($5.99) - braised pork belly, pickled radish served on a baguette with house mayo -- The last order was a no brainer. I mean we're at Banh Mi Boys, so how can you not order banh mi? The Vietnamese sandwich comes out on a warm crusty bun, filled with a balanced combination of pork belly, radishes, and sauce. It was definitely a different experience having banh mi warm, since I usually have the chilled ones from China Town. I have to admit, this ended up ranking last on my list of things we ordered. Not that it wasn't tasty, it just couldn't compete with everything else that was more spectacular in comparison.   If you don't mind your hair, clothes, and skin smelling like smoked meat, Banh Mi Boys is a great spot to hit up for any meal or snack. Two thumbs up from me! :)"}
{"text":"SOOOO GOOOOOOOODDDD! I get the pork or chicken banh mi and it is delicious and super filling. The price is also really great the sandwich is around 5 bucks so its cheaper then a Mcdonalds burger and much better quality."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is a well deserved addition to the Toronto food scene. There steam Bao's is perfect blend of warm bao( Vietnamese steamed bun),meat and refreshing  cucumber and carrots. The sauce in the sandwich is amazing  and blend perfectly with the soft meat and makes the whole sandwich taste lot better. Not a big fan of their tacos but a trip for the steam bao's alone is well worth it.."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot, I've ordered an array of items but seem to gravitate towards the 5 spice pork belly banh mi and kimchi fries which are greatness, sort of like an asian poutine sans fromage! I've had the fried chicken bao which is good too. As a general disclaimer this really isn't Vietnamese food, it's pretty watered down version for the office tower crowd (of which I'm one don't freak out).  Place gets very busy at lunch, I tend to be there either before 12:00 or well after or else you're 10 deep in line watching others eat kimchi fries.  My only complaint: their hot peppers are odd, habanero's just don't go with banh mi's. Years ago at the Queen location they used to serve you the little red thai chili's that go way better with the asian fusion than mexican habanero!  Recommended: 5 spice pork belly banh mi, kimchi fries, fried chicken bao"}
{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews I have to try the place out. Like everyone else, I was impressed with the food. We ordred fried chicken pao, squid taco, pork belly banh mi and kimchee fries. The ingredients were fresh and all the food is flavourful. The price is very affordable consider what one pay at the fast food outlet. This place was packed the moment it opens at noon on a Sunday. Kudos to whoever created these food. A place worthy of repeat visits. Impress your visiting guests from out of town. Who knew Toronto would turn out to be such food heaven."}
{"text":"Wanted to have a casual lunch before walking around Queen Street and Bahn Mi Boys certainly made it possible! Had the Duck confit Bahn Mi and Kimchi fries which were both extremely delicious. The Duck confit was juicy and it paired well with the freshness of the cucumber and the carrots that were stuffed together in the sandwich. The Kimchi fries was very interesting as it came with a generous portion of kimchi together with lemongrass braised tofu which gave it a lemony essence that paired well with the sourness of the kimchi. You can opt to change the bread to either a taco or a bao with the different flavours. Overall, It is a good place for a casual and cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Wow I thought banh mi could only be so good but I was wrong. This place is tasty!!! I got grilled pork banh mi and a pork belly bao. You order, pay, they call your name and ask you how spicy do you want it and if it's to go or not.   The pork belly and bao were seasoned well. It has a good size of pork belly for the price. Wasn't too greasy, the bao was nice and light. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"CHEAP MEATS, CHEAP EATS, LOW GRADE INGREDIENTS  This is always my concern when I head into Chinatown and I order meat, which is, dear god, where did this come from?, and at what prices so that they can charge this price for the food.    We've all had our share of banh, young, penniless, it's the go-to.  I still get the occasional urge and once a year I may get banh off Spad, the second one north of Dundas, ya know, the busy one, yeah, that one.    I trust that quality more than I trust the food-handling and food-purchasing at Banh Mi Boys.    I take issue with the braised cheek, I get the feeling they just add to it, and it never gets cleaned, it just kept on warm forever and forever.  If you do go, get the pork belly, it's popular and it's fresh at least.  I came down with sth after the braised cheek, slow cooked and kept warm on that burner beside the cash.  Right away, auto-reminder, why am I eating Chinatown, it's Mother's Dumplings all over again.  SERVICE  Brisk, friendly, young, really upbeat, up tempo, sweet little cashier, good looking kids in the kitchen, happy to be there, think it's a hip job, people like ya, people pack the place, they're rock stars, ya know.  Good, good kids."}
{"text":"Place is very good at what they do.  Everything is good, but I would recommend the Kimchi fries, Pork Belly Banh Mi, Squid tacos, and deep fried chicken taco.  Need to forewarn, you should probably reserve this for the days where you could care less about calories"}
{"text":"Kimchi fries - that's what you want. With 5 spice pork belly sandwich. Order ahead if you can or else be prepared to wait a long time esp during rush hours."}
{"text":"First time trying banh mi boys and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. Our table of four tried a variety of Bao, banh mi and tacos. Our favorites were the pork belly Bao and kimchi fries. Would definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"I've held off on trying it as I believe in the Vietnamese subs you can get at the super market. But boy was I wrong. I ordered the grilled pork sandwich and it was delicious. The pork was seasoned perfectly and it was cooked to perfection. The bun was warm and toasty and the best part of all was that it was served with a smile. I couldn't finish my sandwich and wasn't expecting smiles for asking for a take out box since I only ordered $6 worth of food. Thanks to them my husband got to try it and now he is a fan too!   Perhaps it's how cozy the tables are set up, I didn't feel weird asking to share a table with a stranger since there were no more open tables and I was by myself. Everyone in there was relaxed and having a good time.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not too keen on paying that much for banh mi especially when you can walk down the street for the something just as delicious for about half the price.   but the kimchi fries are bomb dot com. I mean I could eat this stuff all day every day. the idea might sound strange ...but it works and it's a beautiful thing   the beef cheeks I did not like (bao & banh mi) but the pork belly and kalbi was magnificent on everything."}
{"text":"Had the kimchi fries and the 5 spice pork banh mi. Both are really great. Service was fast. I think it's a little pricy for what it is tho. Total came up to around $17. No complaints otherwise. Will come back."}
{"text":"Incredible value for your money. I've tried most of the sandwiches on their menu, but my go to are the kalbi beef and five spice pork belly (both of which I believe come to ~$7 after tax). They provide a generous portion of deliciously flavoured meat topped with pickled veggies. You can order it as mild or as spicy as you like and they are very accomodating and free of attitude, despite how busy it always is, if you have any questions regarding the ingredients or would prefer something left off.   BMB operates like a well oiled machine. They have clearly done their homework and have an efficient system in place and hire people who can keep up with the pace  and the quality never suffers despite how quickly they turn their food around.   This location is always spotless and despite it having a fast food restaurant type model, the food is not \"fast food\" The staff is professional and friendly which translates to a very  pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"There's a guy called michael there who always remembers the thing I like because I can never remember the name if it. I say \"Mike! what's that thing I like\", and he says \"________, with mild hot sauce\". and damn is it ever good. I thinks it's called Panko something. yum."}
{"text":"We were only in town for a couple days and we ate here twice!  It was that good.  We had the grilled pork banh mi, kalbi beef taco, kimchi fries, pork belly banh mi.  My favorite was the kalbi beef taco.  tender meat marinated in a sweet salty sauce grilled to perfection.  The veggies, carrots, cabbage added a nice crunch.  We could have skipped the kimchi fries.  It was fries, with kimchi, pulled pork, cabbage coleslaw and a drizzle of their house mayo.  The flavors didn't mix well.    The wait is a little long.  They look so busy on the other side of the counter, but you don't know what they're doing because you can only see their heads!  And there is limited seating, 5 tables."}
{"text":"The newly-opened space is still shiny and spartan; a gleaming coke fridge and a coke-themed clock gives the space a slight diner-esque note. But it's far from diner-fare here. This shop has opened its doors for Toronto to taste their take on that cheap-eats staple: the banh mi. But man can not live by banh mi alone! Rounding out Banh Mi Boys' menu are pork buns and tacos. Since I was a stomach of one, I went for the basic grilled pork banh mi.  Now, $5 for a sandwich isn't that expensive, but given that banh mi is usually in the neighbourhood of $2, my first thought when ordering was: is it worth the price hike? I guess that's what I was there to find out.  I asked for them to dress it as they feel it a banh mi should be dressed and watched them assemble it. On the visual scale, Banh Mi Boys' version is slightly bulkier, with lots of pork and none of the mystery meat. Toppings looked fresh and aren't stingily placed on. So far, so good. But on to the important part: taste.  Biting into the sandwich, I was happy to note the bread was crusty, but soft - no need to worry about cutting up the roof of your mouth here. All the veggies had the right pickled taste and crunch. But the biggest difference to me was the pork. Nicely sized chunks of meat and well-seasoned to give it a really good rounded-out flavour. It made the sandwich just-warmed - a nice touch as the weather gets colder.  Was it worth $5? I think so - but it may be borderline for some.  Overall, a promising first visit. I would return to eat this again but would explore the rest of their menu first."}
{"text":"Between their pulled pork, chicken and kalbi beef, the kalbi beef sandwich has become my favourite over the past year. You can get a sandwich and fries for under $15, and it has an awesome, unique taste. The fries are OK - definitely had better ones in other fast-food places, but their sandwiches are great.  They get really busy during the lunch hours (expect a 15 - 30 minute wait)."}
{"text":"Tasty as hell sandwiches for 6 bucks. Enough said."}
{"text":"Yummy Viet and Korean fusion sandwiches. Fast service, good prices. We ordered Kimchi fries, fried chicken steamed bao, kalbi banh mi and grilled chicken banh mi, with two drinks, the bill came out to $28. My favourite was the steamed bao, loved the Asian bun. The banh mi buns were not as crispy as I thought they would be though. Fillings were all very flavourful, the veggies also gave it a really fresh taste and dressing/sauces were just right. Flavour of the Kimchi fries was really good as well, a must-try! The pulled pork in the fries were so good! Only criticism is that the place is small so the tables are cramped and not comfortable. Will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Bao sandwich with pulled pork was filled with crisp, fresh vegetables and it had slightly sweet flavor. The beef taco was lean and tasty. The pork verses the beef was a good balance of sweet and savory. I will return try the Kimchi fries."}
{"text":"Consistently good Vietnamese comfort food at Banh Mi Boys. Lots of classic Vietnamese sandwich offerings plus some Viet/Asian fusion surprises. It's excellent value for your money, which would explain why the place is always rammed. Great staff and definitely cleaner than your traditional Vietnamese sandwich shop. The fried chicken bao sandwich is a personal favourite and a must for any fried chicken aficionado."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time (I know...about time!), and it was sooo good. I can see what all the hype is about!  Came here at 3ish on a Saturday afternoon, and it was super packed! The line up was crazy, but the alluring smells convinced me to wait. And it was definitely worth the wait. Between my friend and me, we got a kalbi beef sandwich and grilled chicken sandwich. I thought the grilled chicken was a boring option, but when I took a bite of it, I fell head over heels for the tenderness of the grilled chicken and that amazing Asian barbecue sauce. The kalbi beef was also finger-lickin' good. Deliciously marinated beef complemented by the spicy kimchi -- to die for!   It was very busy, but the service was very pleasant and efficient. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite place to grab lunch or a snack. Everything is reasonably priced and the portions are decent. There are very limited seats, but turnover is usually high as it takes no time to scarf down a couple tacos or a banh mi.  My favourites so far are the five spice pork belly bao, the squid taco, and the kimchi fries. The soft baos are the perfect vessels as they soak up all those delicious juices. The five spiced pork belly is full of flavour and tender too.   A squid taco sounded scary and not very appetizing at first, but I'm glad I conquered that fear because it's seriously delicious. The crunchy breading, the sweet squid, the tangy mayo along with the pickled veggies and cilantro work so well together.   Lastly the kimchi fries were so generously portioned, and only $5.99, I would have been satisfied just eating them all on their own. Again there's a great blend of flavours (spicy, salty, sweet, tangy) and textures (crunchy, creamy) that make this a winning option.  Definitely stop by if you haven't already, but be prepared to do some waiting as the kitchen gets backed up during peak times."}
{"text":"The pork belly is a MUST try. It's not too heavy and spiced to perfection. The service was fast and easy even though the place was packed. There was no where to sit once we got our food so we simply ate it standing by the counter. The portion is large enough to split between two people. Fav place to grab a quick bite on Queen W."}
{"text":"Pork belly bao,  fried chicken bao is delicious.  Try the kimchi poutine as well.  Small joint with very little seating.  Best to get take out."}
{"text":"Awesome dishes! Have the Club Bao you will not be dissapointed"}
{"text":"This attempt at a hipper, younger version of the traditional Vietnamese sandwich shop seems to try hard, but still doesn't cut it.  We ordered a couple of Pulled Pork sandwiches, with one of them spicy.  It turned out the spicy sauce were just a couple of blobs of Vietnamese hot sauce dripped onto the sandwich after it was made.  The bread was soft and squishy and not the the nice crusty French Baguette that is the foundation of the traditional sandwich.  Furthermore, one bun was almost 2 inches smaller than the other.  That sort of inconsistency is ridiculous when you're paying the same price for both sandwiches.    The Pulled Pork was drier than expected and we could see why as the rather unskilled cook behind the counter seemed to overcook it.  For around $5 a sandwich you can do much better.  Just go north on Spadina to the REAL Bahn Mi places just north of Dundas on the west side of the street and pick up some sandwiches for $2 a piece.  Then pop over to one of the meat or cheese places in Kensington market and add it to your sandwiches for what will inevitably be a much better sandwich experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing line up. Completely worth the wait. Limited seating so plan to take away."}
{"text":"We ate there today for the first time . We split the Kimchi Fries . The portion is quite generous for $6.50 plus tax. It definitely fills you up .The ambiance of the restaurant is cool .  IMHO - I would rate the Kimchi Fries a 5/10 at best . I found there was a weird overpowering salty taste that ruined the meal. I'm not sure what it is . Maybe the fries are seasoned.   Way way too salty  !  Next time, I will return and try the sandwiches, hopefully they are much better than the KF."}
{"text":"Portions seem to be a little on the small side, but nonetheless the dishes are simple, convenient and tasty. The only thing that didn't blow me away were the kimchi fries - extremely soggy."}
{"text":"How could anyone give this place less than 4 stars?? Are you serious? Banh Mi Boys hits it out of the park, everyone knows this... And you see as soon as you eat there. I thought it was a lot of people who never ate banh mi before who were saying how good it is, because it's such a simple dish that why would people be talking about it.  But... then you show up and the line up is out the door...  Bah!  I hate line ups, and being crowded. That's why I minus 1 star on this place. It's a five star experience, but it's so, so small.... Crowded, frustrating.  It's worth facing the line up and being shoulder to shoulder, but I found no point in trying to eat in, keeping it only as a take out place in my book.  The reason its better than other places for banh mi? I think because they focus only on this dish, they are making so many of them, all their stuff is fresh, it's not sitting around for any length of time.  They have more variations than other places, etc.  The fries and add ons are good. The drink selection is any standard fast food type place. I say try it if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I decided to take up a friend on the offer to get food at Banh Mi Boys this past Saturday, their last before closing for renovations. I am glad I did.  The wait was a little longer than I am used to (compared to, say, Ginger), but I am a strong believer that good food takes time to create.  I ordered their pork banh mi and my friend ordered the chicken banh mi. Both were absolutely delicious. The meats were seasoned as to not make the meat itself unrecognizable and I liked the fact that I am able to choose and moderate the sauces and toppings on the banh mi. Portion size is just enough to fill you (or me, anyway) without feeling bloated. Victory!  I am hopeful that when they reopen after renovations they have not decided to increase their price points or portions. Nothing is more frustrating than a place that increases prices and decreases portions, banking on their clientele to not notice (cough-Gandhi's-cough).   I would have rated the place with 5 stars, but having not tried other items on their menu and feeling a tad apprehensive about the forthcoming renovations, I will reserve the 'As good as it gets' rating for another day."}
{"text":"A must eat in toronto! definitely get the kimchi fries and the five-spice pork belly taco - your belly will thank you. I only wish this place has a liquor license.   Am I the only one who isn't into the 'bao' craze? Give me good old fashioned steamed chinese bbq pork bao any day."}
{"text":"I love to eat Vietnamese sandwich. This place used traditional recipes with a modern twist which creates uniquely flavoured buns. We ordered fried chicken steamed bao, kalbi beef banh mi bun, and kimchi fries. The ingredients are so fresh and tasted delicious. A MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Just past Spadina on Queen West sits a small sandwich shop called Banh Mi Boys. Serving up Vietnamese street food, the restaurant follows a long history of similar underground global eats in the city, and hosts another location near Yonge & Gerrard.  Bánh mì is actually a Vietnamese term for a variety of breads, and is a cuisine that has been adopted as a tiny niche market in Toronto's cross-cultural food scene. With fillings like five spice pork belly, braised beef cheek and duck confit sandwiched between soft \"baguettes\" and pickled carrots, cilantro and cucumber, Banh Mi Boys manages to elevate this strand of Asian food to new levels.  The shop is bright and popping with colour, and while the seating is cramped, a high volume of people are constantly moving in and out of this popular restaurant which makes it possible to get a seat every once in a while.  The star standouts of Bahn Mi Boys include their fusion dishes like the Americanized Kimchi fries and Vietnamese-style tacos; the spin on poutine comes loaded with perfectly spiced, fermented napa cabbage with small dollops of house-made mayo on top of pulled pork and a smattering of green onions. The dish is reminiscent of a New York fries concoction, but the mayo proves to be a little exorbitant for this already heavy dish.   In a city that is receptive to multi-cultural, fusion cuisine, it only makes sense that Banh Mi Boys will continue to thrive considering its location on the verge of Chinatown, and its creative re-imagining of cultural delicacies."}
{"text":"Got a squid bahn mi, with max hot seasoning (there are 4 ratings, in increasing spiciness from no spice to siracha, to jalapeño to habanero).  Ingredients, which included various veggies (fresh and pickled), were all very fresh, simple and very flavorful.  Enjoyed it so much I went back for a recreational tasting of a steamed 5 spice pork belly roll (jalapeño).  Also superior.  Both set me back $10.  Among the best fast food I've had."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall, but clean and friendly.  The kimchi fries and squid taco were on my tray and I was not disappointed.  I will definitely go again and try some of their other offerings!"}
{"text":"Ordered their kimchi fries based on all the good reviews and recommendations. I had no complaints the first time I got them, but during the second time I found a hair embedded in my fries when I was more than halfway through the box. I felt disgusted right after and threw the rest away. Never going back to this location"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place! I have tried all of their baos and bahn mis and have yet to be disappointment. Only advice is that it's best to eat while it's fresh and hot -although a cold soggy bao isn't as good, it's still pretty darn tasty.  Must try for everyone! I promise you won't regret it! :)"}
{"text":"Omg we loved this place!! The kalbi beef tacos are so good and cheap! Great place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Grilled chicken Bahn Mi was ok, as were the kimchi fries. Seats are limited so be prepared to take food to go. Nothing special about this place.  I have had viet sub at other family owned Vietnamese which allows me to compare, which in my opinion is better."}
{"text":"Their Kalbi Beef tacos are addicting with the perfect ratio of meat to veg and any of their steamed baos are the perfect cure for you hunger or hangover pangs.   I've only every gotten takeout but they have me hooked! delicious but no cheap eat"}
{"text":"As a vegan I was limited to a handful of items on the menu but what I tried I loved.   Had the tofu tacos and the papaya salad. Went for the highest level of spice on the taco (so it had habaneros instead of jalapeños) and I was impressed. I love my spice and my mouth was pleasantly smoldering.   The tortilla was very interesting. Fresh and doughy with a naan/dosa taste and texture. The tofu was very rich and meaty. Didn't taste like tofu at all (a good thing lol).  The papaya salad was fresh and tangy. Perfect accompaniment for the spicy, meaty taco.  Very good food and quite inexpensive. Lots of variety for the omnivores. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys had initially opened for a little while before closing for renovations in mid February. The renovations ran longer than expected which left me eagerly waiting its re-opening.   This sandwich shop, situated at Queen and Spadina, is ideal for take-out as the food is served quickly and there is limited seating inside. Despite being there around 2 for a late lunch, the place was still busy with many folks standing around hoping to snag a table.  What went in my belly:  Spice Pork Belly Steamed Bao ($3.49) - topped with cucumber, pickled carrots and cilantro which contrasted the fatty, melt-in-your-mouth pork belly nicely. one of my favourites!  Kalbi Beef Taco ($3.99) - topped with a purple cabbage slaw, kimchi, pickled carrots and cilantro. Super saucy and drippy...but in a good way! Not served in a traditional corn tortilla. It was slightly thicker and chewier, similar to a Chinese pancake.  Braised Beef Cheek Banh Mi with slow cooked, onion chutney ($5.99) - Loved the soft baguette it was served on (I hate eating banh mi on a hard, stale bun. you know what I'm talking about!). The beef cheeks were tender and the texture was similar to pulled pork. This was just okay. I wish I had ordered another banh mi instead...  Kimchi Fries ($5.99) - The fries came served in a large box topped with Japanese mayo, kimchi and spicy pork. The tender pulled pork was a welcome addition and the combination of all the flavours was delicious. I'm someone who only enjoys kimchi in small doses so I was glad the kimchi flavour wasn't overwhelming. Highly recommended!  Sure, the prices are a high compared to the other banh mi joints in the area but the prices here are still reasonable and the food is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Not a banh mi expert but this is pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, tacos and steamed bao with the pickled veggies. Quick and fast paced. Restaurant is busy all the time so cleanliness is an issue sometimes"}
{"text":"went to the one on yonge with a friend - fairly small, but not claustrophobic in my opinion. i ordered tofu steamed bao and it was so good i went back and ordered another. they have tofu options for every type of sandwich so you have good options even if you're vegetarian, which is a nice change! everything in the sandwich had lots of flavours, vegetables included. only thing to note is that the person making your food may or may not have a heavy accent so just listen closely to the name they're calling"}
{"text":"Was really hungry and deciding between this place or Burger Priest. Deciding to give this place a try. The seating is very small with a few 4 tops and a few 2 tops. The menu is very simple with a few choices for Banh Mi, Steam Bao and another selection. Few meat selection as well. They do have duck confit and kimchee fries that is quite popular.  We opted to try the Pork Belly Banh Mi. Nice and tender with some simple toppings. Good taste. Second Banh Mi was the Kalbi Beef which is boneless. Those who love short ribs would enjoy this. I thought it was good as well.  Last we got some sweet potato fries. This was standard. All for the price tag of about $18. I guess it would work out cheaper than Burger Priest. I believe I would come back and try something else next time."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto, Banh Mi Boys was the first place our host took us for lunch. Immediately I was put off by the 25 minute wait at lunch rush. However, once we received our sandwiches, I was hooked. Pork belly was my friends favorites, but I personally enjoy the squid. Don't expect quick service, but the food is great and relatively cheap. Avoid the lunch rush and you should be fine."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Convenient, simple and yet tasteful.   What to expect: 1. quick, fast food style service 2. healthy enough to not feel guilty 3. cost you $10-8 4. you will come back again"}
{"text":"Not only do I love it here, every person I have ever introduced to it, is also hooked.  Don't be afraid of the big line, it moves quickly and everyone is so excited to get their sandwich, even the line has a great vibe.    I can never decide between the Kalbi beef taco and a Banh Mi, so I always get both...  and end up with half a sandwich in the fridge for a late night snack.  Trust me, you will be craving it again soon, so this system works really well!"}
{"text":"Not sure why it took so long for someone to deliver on this concept. Bahn Mis have long been tasty, but never tastier than with duck confit. Round off your visit with a fried chicken bao and a kimchi pulled pork poutine to share and you're set. Okay, and maybe a grape or orange Crush, too."}
{"text":"There is a reason why everyone talks about this place. Because it rocks your taste buds and makes you happy! Kimchi Fries are a must try."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot.  The value is amazing,  6 bucks for a delicious,  filling sandwich.  Hands down this place is worth going just for the price point.   The food is actually very delicious,  everything is made fresh.  The venue is pretty small and feels even smaller with the lineup.  It's definitely a to go place.    I love the braised beef sandwich,  but I hear that the bao is very good as well.  I'm not much of a fan of the kimchi fries,  but then again I'm not a huge fan of kimchi in the first place.    Definitely a place to check out. Be prepared to wait in a fairly long line (especially at lunch)."}
{"text":"D-LISH!  You need to try this place.  I have not had any other banh mi sandwiches to compare to, that is why this is only a 4 and not a 5, but I love what they have to offer.  I have tried always every sandwich on the menu, and I have never been disappointed.  The  kim chi fries are great too, and definitely worth adding as a side.  Make sure you go with at least one other person so that you can trade half of your sandwiches so that you get a chance to try a couple different kinds at a time.  I have never had their steamed bun sandwiches, but they look great, and I will be ordering them next time I go.  It is quite small in terms of seating, so be prepared to take your food to go, in case their aren't any seats available.  If you are looking for a tasty lunch, and you are in the area, (even if you aren't if would be worth going out of your way), you need to check this place you."}
{"text":"It's cheap, it's delicious, and you can get almost anything on a bao (like the outside of a steamed pork bun) or as a soft wrap taco or as a banh mi. I'm in love."}
{"text":"Been craving for Kimchi Fries for a long time, saw a post about the place the other day, decided to have a try since it's really close to where I live. Food: really good, good portion, good tasting, good combination of texture. Would like it better if it's more spicy.  Service: Polite and friendly, but out of no where, felt like they've missed something. But after all, food was so cheap and good, what more could you ask for?  Others: That's how this place didn't make it to 4 stars. Small stuff, but enough to make you feel less comfortable.  I don't really understand the crumbs on the table, because it was 5pm in the afternoon, they had more than 5 staff behind the counter and 5 customers eating or ordering. Only thing I want from them was for one of them to take 1 minute to clean those 6 or 7 tables they have. I had a tiny piece of foil in my kimchi fries, wasn't a big deal considering its a small and affordable place so I just spited it out, but I would be much more appreciate if it was not there."}
{"text":"I love the baos.  Fluffy bun filled with simple delicious flavours.  I find the pulled pork lacks flavour but everything else I've tried is great."}
{"text":"Great eats. Not something you can find just anywhere. I recommend the 5 spice pork belly."}
{"text":"Love this place. I don't understand how McDonald's is still in business with so many other fantastic fast-food joints like this open. (Fine, fine. I do understand how, but it just isn't right!)   One banh mi is really probably enough food, but you definitely need to try the bao (steamed buns with several different filling options). I've never been disappointed with any of the banh mi, and the same goes for the bao except for maybe the tofu.   The service is really fast, but this is actually problematic (assuming you want to eat on site), because there is rarely a table free at this Queen St. location. Part of the reason is that people will save tables while their friends order, creating a bottleneck for other customers whose food is already out. I'm for a no table saving policy here, given how few tables there are and how small the dining space is. (Dining is a bit of a stretch, given it's cafeteria/fast-food style, but you catch my drift.) One guy actually refused to give his seats up, even though his friends were pretty far back in line. Not cool! So I guess that would be the only deterrent to going here. Otherwise, I'd suggest getting your order to go.  That said, I'd still opt for the Queen St. location over the other Banh Mi location over on Yonge St., just above Dundas, because the employees at the Queen St. location are so much friendlier."}
{"text":"Filling and satisfying, I usually get the braised tofu banh mi and it's hearty and delicious."}
{"text":"Reviews don't lie. We came based on yelp recommendations, and were not disappointed. The queue went fast, and the five spice pork belly bahn mi was soooo yummy. Try it!!!"}
{"text":"OMFG. I went to this place after reading delightful reviews in the local TO weeklies and it was everything I was hoping for and more.  I had the pork belly sandwich and was in heaven from the first bite to the last. Want to move my way around the menu....and with the incredibly reasonable prices, won't be breaking the bank in this mission.    With such delicious and unique fillings and fresh baguettes they're served in, I honestly have no idea why people would frequent the usual sub sandwich joints."}
{"text":"I don't know about this place. I tried the Five Spiced Pork Belly Banh Mi and thought it was alright. The prices though are a little steep as you can just walk up Spadina to get a Banh Mi for $2."}
{"text":"Seriously, a tasty, filling sandwich in a trendy Queen West restaurant for the same price as fast food?  Pinch me, I'm dreaming about sandwiches again.  Except it's really real!  $5.99 will get you your choice of most of the sandwiches on the menu board--I had the galbi, beef short ribs, and the meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The toppings complemented it well--fresh carrots and coriander, spicy kimchi, a nice balancing sour tang from the marinade.  Even though it was crowded at lunch time, takeout was fast.  This place might become a regular lunch stop."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is an absolute gem when you're  craving something tasteful and simple. I always order the fried chicken steam bao along with the pork belly steam bao. I've  been here multiple times and they have never let me down. They also have this special called the \"club bao\" which is a combination on the fried chicken along with the pork belly.  I'm telling you it's absolutely amazing.  Also their kimchi fries will leave you thinking about it all day long even after you've had it for lunch.  The only complaint i have is the fact that there aren't enough tables and chairs if you want to eat inside but obviously this complaint does not reflect on the quality of their food. If I could give them 6 stars out of 5 I would. If you're ever around the area of Queen and Spadina I would definitely recommend you trying this establishment out."}
{"text":"The best way I can describe this is place is if someone described what banh mi is to a hipster foodie, and he just went, \"Yes, we can make that.\"  I had the beef cheek banh mi.  The pickles, very much a defining characteristic of banh mi, were close to tasteless.  The meat was under seasoned.  There wasn't enough mayo or butter.  The kim chi fries were limp and no good. Apparently they double cook (blanch, and then fry), and I had to wait a long time for them.  I cannot explain the terribleness.  Just walk 10 minutes to the real Viet shops and order from the ladies who don't speak English.  Much better food for 1/2 the price.  I joke about the hipster fandom of this place, but if you really think this place is \"amazing\", definitely try out a real banh mi.  EDIT: Originally, I gave this a one-star, which was an emotional response because I love banh mi so much.  Two star is more appropriate - edible, but would not come back."}
{"text":"The food here is tasty and service is quick. The bahn mis are pretty good, the baos are yummy but get soggy if left in the wrap for too long and the kim chi fries are interesting... it was basically a kim chi poutine. I doubt I'd ever order the kim chi fries again, it was a little bit too salty for my liking.  Overall a yummy place for lunch!"}
{"text":"I had the duck confit banh mi for lunch and I fell in love on first bite. The duck was so moist and tender and with the combination of pickled carrots, cucumbers and coriander and the flaky baguette, the sandwich is a perfect blend of sweet, crunchy and savoury. At only 7 bucks and change it left me feeling completely satisfied in my stomach and in my wallet. There was a long line-up but I ordered using the Ritual app and it felt so sweet passing all the suckers in line to pick up my order."}
{"text":"I had the beef cheek banh mi. Perhaps I heard so much about this place from my husband, I had high expectations. Well, sorry to say, It was not worth what I paid for! :( I think I'll stick to regular banh mi down the street for less than half the price and bigger portions!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying Kimchi Fries - it was definitely interesting. It gets very crowded fast so go early!"}
{"text":"My first bite in Toronto! Yelp has never let me down and this hole the wall joint is another satisfying find. Seating is limited even though seats and tables are generally clean. Best option is to take the food to go. Ingredients are as fresh as they can be. Meats - I had their 5 spices pork belly and duck confit - are tender and well-loved by whoever cooked them overnight. The best part about this experience is how individual ingredients combine in your mouth to give you a food-gasm."}
{"text":"Finally got around to checking out Banh Mi Boys recently and glad I did! This is definitely a new lunchtime spot for me.  I got the Grilled Pork Banh Mi Sandwich ($5.50) and the Kimchi Fries ($6.50). It was a ton of food and I couldn't even finish it! The Grilled Pork Banh Mi is smokey, juicy, and full of flavour. The Kimchi Fries are really good as well and come in quite a large serving.   The wait time is about average for the food itself and the lineup can be pretty long around lunchtime. Seating is limited to, but you can get the food to go."}
{"text":"I still prefer the traditional banh mi over these ones. They have a nice twist to them, yet I find them a lot greasier than the traditional ones. Because of its popularity, it is a bit more expensive than the trad. banh mi as well (~$5). A notable mention though is their kimchi fries, never tried something like that before and that was definitely an amazing twist. The only drawback is that you need to split it with someone as it is quite a lot of fries to down yourself.   Lineups are always long and very limited seats available, so I highly recommend going before lunch hour and get it to go if you can."}
{"text":"For the sake of conciseness,  Pros: Friendly Staff, Good Food, Good Prices. Have Vanilla Coke. Can go eat in Alexandra Park.   Cons: Limited Seating, intense lunch rush. Very narrow place. Would be great if they were open very late.  Also all that cabbage is going to wreck havoc on you later if you're not used to it (cramp-city population: you)"}
{"text":"Thanks yelpers! Your reviews saved me when the original place I was planning to visit was closed.   Although the banh mi is not as good as the one at Niagara Seafood in Buffalo, it was a great shop!  Lots of choices, good ingredients, modern twists and classic ideas.  Nice job! Everything we ordered was yummy and hit the spot!  I only wish I lived closer because I would eat here often!"}
{"text":"Just awesome! Coming from Maryland, we have had the traditional banh mi. However, this place took it to whole different level! From the grilled pork to the lemongrass tofu, all were spectacular. Also, the tofu kimchi fries added a nice touch to our meal. Next time we're in town, we will certainly make a stop at this place."}
{"text":"LOVE the grilled pork.   Really did not appreciate the guy at the cash today who was wearing a baseball cap, talking on his cell phone, and texting on his cell phone in between customers. Super unprofessional and shows a major lack of customer service."}
{"text":"You know when you're hungry and looking for something quick but you're not in the mood for burgers or pizza....and you can't figure out exactly what's going to satisfy your hunger without making you feel all greasy and fat af? Banh mi boys is the solution!  Their kimchi fries are to die for (their kimchi actually tastes legit), as are their pork belly baos.  The chicken banh mi is also very good.   They get quite busy so I would recommend getting takeout as opposed to dining in, as the space is quite small and gets crowded pretty quickly especially during peak lunch/dinner hours."}
{"text":"Food is good: fresh veggies, meat is not super high quality but not bad either, and quite inexpensive. Cute little place!!!"}
{"text":"I love Bahn Mi. I love that I can walk five minutes from my door & pick up a tasty Vietnamese sub for $1.75, chalk full of mystery meat cold cuts, cilantro, garlicky mayo, picked daikon/carrots & burn my face off chilis. It's a full meal under $2!  Enter Bahn Mi Boys at Queen & Spadina. Or as I heard a staff member in the fast foodish resto say \"Bahn Mi for Westerners\". Funny, we were the only two white people there, other than one of the guys behind the counter.  I'd describe Bahn Mi Boys more as elevated asian-inspired street food (sorry for sounding like a pretentious tit). All the classics are here: Chinese BBQ pork buns (stuffed with pork belly, just like Momofuko), Korean BBQ in the form of tacos & their namesake Bahn Mi (multiple versions available including beef cheek, pork belly & pulled pork).  We tried the Beef Cheek steamed buns ($4.95), the Pulled Pork tacos ($3.99 each) & the jicama slaw ($4).  The buns were very good, Beef was succulent & the toppings were super fresh. A bit too much \"steamed bun\" though, buns could be a bit smaller to let the stuffing shine. Pulled Pork tacos were great, just enough spice and not too greasy. Also loved the grilled corn tortillas. Jicama slaw was a great substitute to fries, the acid was a great way to cut the richness of the other items.  A great, cheap meal (under $25 with sodas)."}
{"text":"I wasn't thoroughly impressed by the banh-mi and I have honestly had better in China Town for much cheaper. However, the kimchi fries (although not my favorite) are quite a unique concept."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place because I am addicted to the Banh Mi sandwiches in Chinatown.  This was a big disappointment.  I have the pulled pork sandwich, small and overpriced at $6.20.  The pork was dry and tasteless.  I found the place impersonal and slightly unfriendly.  Those high counters make it seem like a fortress and you cant see your sandwich being made, it just appears without any question about what you might want on it.  I won't return till they improve the quality and increase the size of the sandwiches for the price."}
{"text":"To pricy for the insufficient ingredients stuffed in the baguette . The sandwiches definitely need more stuffing to make it worthwhile the price of a sandwich and that of Vietnamese nature. In addition, the baguette needs to be more crispy and crunchy , in order to make it more Vietnam like :-)"}
{"text":"So I was in the area and decided to try this place out after hearing all the hype.  My \"plan of attack\" was to try the kimchi fries & the steam bao \"sandwich\", then if I had space maybe I'd get the banh mi to go and take a bite.    First impressions like a lot of places along Queen St West it was long and deep once you enter, with kitchen/ordering counter in the back.    Have a look at the one inside pic in the photos area, there literally like 6 two seater tables (4 of them put together in twos close to the entrance).   Thats all the seating they have and standing bar/ledge to eat for the rest.  So don't bother bringing 4-6 people to chow down here and hope to find seating - I hear it gets real busy.  My \"plan of attack\" failed due to the generous and deceiving looking portions.  I'm telling you look at the photo section before going down (which I didnt)...the steam bao sandwich is a good solid portion though it looks deceivingly small -- especially for a guy lol.  I got the fried chicken steamed bao since I read blogTO , bad move...it was moist and krispy but not a game changer.    I really liked the steamed bao \"bun\" its soft and fluffy texture made for a really good bun...and if the filling had gravy it would soak it in real good too.   So I suggest being more adventurous with the filling choice...  Onto the saving grace and star of the show....the kimchi fries.   This is da sh*t.  I was a little apprehensive in ordering it, since I'm not a big kimchi fan .... at least not the hard core kind of kimchi with massive amounts of garlic and chilli sauce.  But to my surprise this was a clash of worlds in terms of taste and texture.  Okay get this the kimchi was a lighter version (as I suspected as to not turn away non asian clientele) ; with cool crispy cabbage with hot sauce heat of like say sriracha which is more savory than hot.  For the kimchi think along the lines of pickled veg, now mix in pulled pork with some rich gravy almost like poutine gravy, on warm fries garnished with green onions.   This my friends is my new go to comfort food.   Its runs along the lines of eating poutine or taco bell fries supreme.   Suggestion mix it up good then dig in.   The Kimchi fries are a huge portion too, I was expecting more of side serving in their faux NY Chinese food containers.  Its like getting a double order of taco bell fries supreme.  Easy for two girls to share this, can serve as a meal for a guy with a good appetite.   Oh and they also have old skool glass bottle coke, which for anyone that knows tastes so much better than the canned or plastic bottle kind once ice cold.  I will update the next time I try the actual Banh Mi...I got my eye on the duck confit one.... these guys are taking something traditional and amping it up.  And yeah a shout out to the banh mi that I grew up with (and also being sold at T&T) the Nguyen Huong on 322 Spadina Ave.....still a classic, but no longer a dollar but two now lol."}
{"text":"Had a lunch here. Definte asian fusion sandwich. Food was really good. Only minus is place is really busy and packed. Well, it shows they make some good food."}
{"text":"Belly Banh - Fresh clean flavours, not over-salted. 1 sandwich for a light meal, 2 if you're hungry. Kimchi fries - Fries topped with mayo, green onion, kimchi and pulled pork.  very tasty and heavy - helps fill in the gaps when starving Chicken/Beef/Calamari Banh - all very good too  Very affordable.  Long line (usually) but moves fast.    Final Verdict: Must check out if in the area."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Every time I am in the area I can't resist going in there. I haven't ordered much of the items of the menu because I keep coming back for the pulled pork bao. The pulled pork has this great sweet bbq sauce that it's to die for! The bao is so soft and so delicious I could eat so many of them. and the cilantro and cucumber  just make everything taste so light and fresh. Honestly, I can eat so many of them and I'm craving them as I type this. So delicious. Honestly, can't go wrong with this if you like pulled pork. And it's just so inexpensive which makes it 10x better. Totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  + Polite and prompt service + Delicious food (cheap too!) + Vast array of Vietnamese lunch items - Wish they had more seating"}
{"text":"They do a lot of take-outs as it is close to a lot of businesses on Yonge Street. Don't come by around lunch time as they are super packed. You might not get a seat if you are looking to sit down and enjoy a nice lunch.  I love their Kimichi Fries and Five Spice Pork Belly Steamed Bao. These are my go-to selection when I come here for a quick lunch. A nice twist to the otherwise regular Banh Mi."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 4-5 times now. Food is always great, tables in the place could use a quick wipe down otherwise this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Yummy and cheap! A little oily but I guess that can't be helped. The pulled pork sandwich is great and the Kimchi fries are also deeelish!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!!!  Very happy to see when there are plenty of vegetarian options -  I got the pank tofu Bao. Person I was with got pulled pork - galbi - pork belly and chicken bao. Everything was tasty as hell, staff was really nice and place is clean. Everything is well priced, and the size of their bao is really good for the price!  This location is really nice, lots to do in the area and there is a green p parking garage around the corner. TIp for anyone going in June -  the parking garage on 30 roehampton is free for the first 2 hrs until June 30th 2017  I'm sold for life, this is my go to Bao-Taco-Banh Mi place now."}
{"text":"I use to think that people only come here because they do not know about Nguyen Huong up at Spadina and many other places. But I tried Banh Mi Boys for the first time and by surprise they actually have a variety of very delicious sandwiches. My top favorite would be the Kalbi Beef one. They also have steamed Bao which is very delicious as well. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Tables after us got their orders before us. We were told different orders which is why ours was taking 15 minutes longer. Not sure why they would lie when the neighbouring tables  had similar orders. I was also told fried chicken takes longer to make? Table next to us got that too! Disgruntled and annoyed that there wasn't even an apology. Worst Banh Mi Boyz service ever experienced. Maybe the staff here needs customer service training."}
{"text":"We stumbled into the area accidentally and after the many reviews, I had to try it for myself to find out what the commotion is all about.  We decided to order: -Kim Chi Fries 5.99 - Kalbi Beef Taco 3.59 - Pork Banh Mi sandwich 4.99  Everything was fresh and tasted awesome.  The Pork Banh Mi Sandwich consisted of a pork coated with sweet sauce served with Fresh pickled carrots/radish and cilantro, inside a soft yet crisp bun.   The Kim Chi Fries were my favorite. A geneous heap of premium quality kim-chi overtop fresh hand-cut fries and pieces of shredded pork sprinkled with what looked like a mayo sauce and fresh green onions. To die for!!!! yum...  The Kalbi beef taco was awesome. A serving the size of a large fist, the kalbi was well seasoned, cooked right, and super tasty. This was served inside a fresh tortilla along with pickled carrots/daikon and purple cabbage.   The damage was $18.90 ordered with a bloody orange san pellegrino.  Overall very s-a-t-i-s-f-y-i-n-g....! Left with my stomach full but not an empty wallet.  Try it, you'll like it.  Next time, will try the steamed buns with deep fried chicken."}
{"text":"A great option for people who want to eat Vietnamese subs, but don't trust the ones sold in Chinatown. I like that their sandwiches don't have suspicious cold cuts or weird meat. Also very affordable and fresh compared to other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Craving some good banh mi? For a good price? this is the place to be. While the place is a bit small, the food is delicious. Although they specialize in banh mi, the Kimchi fries is worth a try!you can add pork or tofu if you are a vegetarian. A definite guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"Only tried a couple of things, but they were delicious!  Had the pork belly banh mi, and some thing else...  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The kimchee fries are phenomenal, and the pork belly banh mi was awesome.  Fairly fast service and friendly people. Long lines at peak times."}
{"text":"Food is merely ok.  Certainly not as good as authentic Banh Mi."}
{"text":"Yummy steam bun with pork belly."}
{"text":"This location I have been going to for a long time. The food is one of a kind. The food is prepared to order fast. The staff seem to be like a family, like they enjoy coming in and it translates to the food. I also recommend you eat there; the kalbi tacos do taste better immediately after they're made. Then ten minutes later when I get home.  I've had the kalbi tacos, the pork belly bao and the fried chicken bao all amazing. I would hazard a guess the other dishes are great too."}
{"text":"Yum! My friend recommended this place to me for their kimchi fries, but I ended up only trying their kalbi beef taco. Oh my gosh, yasss!! It was so delicious! I loved the mix of beef, pickled veggies (ones you usually find in banh mi), cilantro, and kimchi. The fusion of it and their sauce is so good! Just be very careful when eating! The sauce will drip everywhere! lol   Also, $4 for this delicious taco? So worth it!"}
{"text":"I visited this place based on the good reviews, but was a bit disappointed. The food is priced cheap, but they also give small portions, so it's relative. I ordered the steamed bao, which was alright, but it wasn't anything spectacular. Sitting areas are also very limited."}
{"text":"The Kimchi  fries are good, and definitely an item  to share. It is quite a lot for one to eat alone since it is piled with pulled pork.  My other favourite item is the steamed bao items. Preferably the braised beef cheek! This is flavourful and the beef is really tender."}
{"text":"Will definitely go back! Great cheap eats. I recommend the steamed bao (filled with whatever you like)."}
{"text":"I'm an ex-Calgarian and assumed that hot Vietnamese subs were prevalent in all cities. When I moved to Toronto, I found this to be untrue.   But then I found Banh Mi Boys and was blown away. The quality is better than anything I had in Calgary, and this second location is a lot closer to my house, which makes me happy."}
{"text":"Delicious, spicy, fresh and hot!  Good price and great friendly service.  I will be back many times!"}
{"text":"I've never had a meal here that wasn't completely delicious and very reasonably priced.   I typically go for the grilled pork bahn mi ($4.99) (--a seriously great deal) and a steamed bao ($3.49) though last time I opted for the Kalbi beef short rib bahn mi ($6.99...that's cheaper than most sandwiches at Subway, the size is comparable, and it has the added perk of actually tasting good) & a pulled pork taco ($3.99). Both were incredible and packed with flavour. I've also tried the squid bahn mi as well as the pork belly.   Seriously, I have never eaten anything here that I haven't enjoyed immensely. Also, the staff always seem very efficient. There's usually a decent sized lineup but everytime I've been in it's moved quickly.   Do yourself a favour and try it out. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Swung by quickly on my way elsewhere and tried the beef cheek bahn mi. The meat was incredibly tender, and the bread they use felt so fresh and soft! I wish there had been more sweet carrots and cucumbers but that may have been because I asked for it to be \"super hot\" and my mouth needed the refreshment! I said I was only going to eat half, but before I knew it I'd finished the entire thing!  Will definitely go back to try another."}
{"text":"For the price, this place is great.  - Bahn mi We've tried a few, overall these are just ok  - Steamed Bao These are great. I would recommend these over the bahn mi. Definitely get the fried chicken.  - kimchi fries Definitely need to order these."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and ordered pork belly banh mi following others reviews. When I came in, there was a long queue but I didn't wait so long until my sandwich was served. It was so good! The bread was warmed up unlike other Vietnamese sandwich places. I would come back again and try other sandwiches and sides."}
{"text":"Updated review based on Foodora delivery. Soggy soggy mess. Sweet potato fries were all soggy, had to waste 3/4 o lf it. Banh Mi itself was pretty soggy as well. Good to eat in, terrible for delivery."}
{"text":"Same quality every single time, which is awesome and hard to come across. Tried them when they first open, awesome .. went this afternoon, just as awesome. personal favs would be the pulled pork bao, sweet potato fries, kalbi beef taco and banh mi and kim chi fries !"}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for \"10 stars!\"  Banh mi boys is absolutely the bees knees. The pork belly bao can't even be described in words, more so in sounds. \"Mmmm...oh my god...what is this?!?...ahhhh\"   I was told to try the kimchi fries and the pork belly bao and sub and man oh man I couldn't believe my tastebuds, I thought they were lying to me.   Awesome food, cool vibe, efficient service, totally franchise-worthy...(hint!!! Come to Ottawa!)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Lemon grass tofu Banmi. It comes with crunchy julienned radish and carrots, which I reckon was soaked in vinegar and sugar. The flavor is further accentuated with a couple of slices of cucumber and mushrooms. It is all about the lemon grass sauce with this sandwich.   It is one of those places that ask for your name when you order. My mom gave me one of those weird names, so I tend to give them a fake one to make it easier. It tends to backfire on me, when I don't respond to the fake name I give them. Learn from my mistakes!"}
{"text":"This place has become my favourite joint to stop in for a quick bite downtown. The vibe is awesome: Old School hiphop playing, friendly counter staff, and line cooks who seem like they are having a very good time at work. It's a bit of a cramped space, so if you go during peak hours be prepared to wait in line for a bit (they are pretty quick actually, considering there is usually a large line), and you might not find a table.  But no matter! The food is what takes centre stage here: Flavourful meat of many varieties (meatless options are also available, but I am a carnivorous fellow so I know not of them), excellent choice of garnish, different and equally delicious delivery systems (ie. Taco, Bao, Bahn Mi, Fries) and delicious sauces are what sets Bahn Mi Boys apart. I really can't think of any other restaurant quite like the experience here.  I usually get the Kalbi Beef Taco (So good!); a mashup of Korean style beef, Kimchi, Traditional Bahn Mi garnish, served in a soft taco shell. Amazing combination.  Also good are the Baos; I like the fried chicken Bao, which is a flavourful nugget of fried chicken served in a steamed rice bun with bahn mi toppings and mayo.  I know their name is \"Bahn MI\" boys, and I have also tried their synonymous sandwiches. I like a Bahn Mi as much as the next guy (especially the ones on Spadina for $2.50!), and theirs are very good, and offer more choices than most traditional Bahn Mi places. But the tacos and Bao are far superior in flavour and construction and I would highly recommend them.   The Kimchi fries are also delish."}
{"text":"We ended up here because a friend and I planned to go to Lucky Red (the bar / resto from the same folks as Banh Mi Boys) and found a note on the window saying \"closed for renovations\" (Thurs Aug 4, 2016).  Weren't they just under reno last year?!?  Anyhoooo, we walked from Lucky Red to Banh Mi Boys cuz I had talked up the steamed baos and my friend from out-of-town really wanted to try them.  We got there during a small lull (~730pm), so were able to nab a table after we placed our order:  2 x steamed pork belly baos;  1 x kalbi taco;  1 x fried chicken bao;  1 x yam fries.  Their large fridge was down, so only 1 cooler had cold drinks.  Hopefully they fix that quickly!    I've had the banh mi's and baos from here many times, but this is first time trying their taco.  Really enjoyed it;  it wasn't a true tortilla, but instead, reminiscent of an indian roti, but a little more crisp.  It was really good.  The baos were all delicious, although my memory of past pro-belly baos saw thicker cuts of pork belly.  The only disappointment were the yam fries;  processed fries that I can buy frozen;  nothing to write home about.  Should've gone for kimchi fries which I've enjoyed in the past.  The place is busy, but people don't linger, so tables churn over relatively quickly.  It's a great stop for a quick bite that's definitely a step above fast-food!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and it's been quite consistently good food wise.  My usual is the the grilled pork banh mi($5.50).  Generous portions of grill pork. The squid banh mi ($6) is quite good too.  Of course, Kimchi fries ($6.50) is a must try here."}
{"text":"Their vietnamese subs are unpretentious, filling and easy on the pocket. And their store at Queen and Spadina is the perfect pit stop on my shopping excursions.  The Kalbi Beef Banh Mi (short ribs, kimchi and Asian bbq sauce) was delish and the combo of flavours and textures was spot on!  One note of caution: be prepared for long line-ups because this joint is popular! It usually takes me about 20 min to order, pay and get my food. But it's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Prior to eating at Banh Mi Boys, I had high expectations and was excited, as considerable hype surrounds this establishment. I had heard that it was \"the best\" The place is very narrow and tiny. Even on a non busy day, it evokes feelings of claustrophobia and it was almost unbearable when we went on a Saturday afternoon - everyone was packed like sardines. The place is relatively clean and the decor isn't offensive.  My group and I ordered 2 kalbi beef tacos, 1 squid taco, 1 order of kimchi fries and 1 order of regular fries. The prices are more than reasonable as the total ending being in the low to mid $20 range, which is good for all the food we ordered.  However, the food is mediocre AT BEST. As previously mentioned, the place is small and as a result, seating is extremely limited and near impossible on a busy day, so we just asked them to bag our food. Our bags quickly became drenched and soggy due to the greasy nature of the food.   I am ethnically Vietnamese and I know that this place is Asian fusion, so I'm not expecting authenticity at all... but I wouldn't even classify the food as even partially Vietnamese. I'd say it's barely even Asian food.  Now for the food itself:  1 squid taco - The highest compliment I can give it is palatable and marginally above intolerable. The taco was too dry and salty, particularly the squid. It seemed that I was the one out of my group who tolerated the food the most.  2 beef kalbi tacos - I also went with 2 people who each ate a beef kalbi taco. They said it was very disappointing.  1 order of regular fries - If you go, don't order them. There is seriously nothing special about them - they're soggy, floppy and poorly seasoned. Just go to McDonalds.  1 order of kimchi fries - 2 people who are avid fans of Korean food didn't like them.  With all of the aforementioned in mind, I probably would have given this establishment 2 to 2.5 stars - while the food wasn't very good, it wasn't completely awful and we finished our food.  The catalyst for the 1 star review, which I've never given a business on Yelp before, was the terrible customer service which cemented us never coming back.   The girl at the register wrote down our order incorrectly. She hadn't waited for us to finalize our order and wrote down what we had initially ordered (but later changed) while we were still deliberating. So when they were actually making the food and called us, she read off the wrong order. I obviously was confused and questioned her.   I didn't want to trouble the employee (even though we paid for the food) and told her that whatever they made would be fine with me... but one of the guys in the back was really aggressive and said very audibly (we heard him loud and clear), \"NOW WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE\"   First, we didn't actually ask him to do that. Secondly, this wasn't our fault as it was the error of another employee. Finally, his attitude and demeanour was irked us. I don't expect people to be bubbly and super friendly - as long as the experience is polite and smooth, I won't ever complain. But to act like we were personally inconveniencing is egregious - that's your job.  Finally, the last nail in the coffin was when he very patronizingly ordered us to not do \"that\" again. We still don't know what we aren't supposed to do again (except come back). The situation is attributed to one employee making a mistake (one that I honestly wouldn't have minded) and then another one escalating the situation.  I know that my review is an anomaly among the majority, but I did want to share my experience in hopes that the management will read it and implement much needed change."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot, But someone really needs to tone down the femnazi line cook bitching about men and her job at the top of her lungs..."}
{"text":"Yumsters ... I had this huge smile on my face throughout the time I was there    Quebecoise + Korean = Kimchi fries Vietnamese bun ... Super filling, fresh and I loved that I could customize what I wanted in my sandie. Ie... No cilantro and spicy level.   On another note... There's no good fast food options in the vicinity. So. That's another reason I like bmb."}
{"text":"Tried Grilled Pork and Braised Beef Banh Mi, I liked the Grilled Pork Banh Mi more.  It is juicy, grill to perfection, but a bit on the salty side.  On the other hand, the Braised Beef Banh Mi is a bit dry and not very tender (it is more expensive too).  The Banh Mi is about 7\" long, perfect size for a lunch. There is always a long lineup during lunch hour,  better be there before noon to avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"The bao and the kimchi fries are delicious. I've eaten here at least a dozen times. The only issue I have is the last 2 times I ordered it delivery there was a hair in my kimchi fries. I know it's impossible to completely avoid hair in food service, but twice in a row is a turn off."}
{"text":"Sometimes I dream about this place. I can imagine the taste of a pork belly and pickled veggie sandwich even at this moment and I wish I they had 24 hour delivery. The most delicious fast food in Toronto. Try everything on the menu. Only downside is it is so busy in here it is more fun to get take out than to eat in and they are only open 12pm-10pm, which rules out late night cravings (which you will have once you try this place). I would be happy to eat here everyday and I find excuses to go to this neighbourhood just to stop in here. I pray/dread they open one closer to me. Love it!!"}
{"text":"I ordered two kimchi fries with tofu, found out there were no kimchi in both of them! The quantity seem less than other location too. Wasn't what I expected at all..."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful option when you want a quick lunch or dinner.   I've had the grilled pork and grilled chicken and they are delicious.   Not a lot of tables in this place and best for takeout!"}
{"text":"I don't think I can say enough goods things about this place. Since visiting yesterday, I've been talking about it nonstop - my friends are getting sick of it, but I want to get the word out!!  I first learned about BMB when I walked past their restaurant while they were still under construction.  I made a mental note to stop by one day for lunch since it's so close to my work... I was not disappointed.  They take simple, pedestrian food and elevate it to appeal to a broader audience.  Their menu consists of  banh mi (Vietnamese subs), steamed \"bao\", soft tacos and fries including a Kim Chi poutine.  Pricing is also very reasonable starting from $3.50 for a bao.  On this particular visit, I ordered a beef cheek bao and a pork belly bao.  Both were seasoned very nicely and the steamed boa was perfectly soft with just a hint of sweetness.  The soft and juicy meet was offset by crisp and lightly pickled carrots and radish and a slice of cucumber.  A great balance of flavours and textures.    Will definitely be back as I eat my way through their menu... Duck Confit Banh Mi, I've got my eye on you!"}
{"text":"God I love, love this place. Like, its a bit of a problem. For the price point, its the best meal in the city. I swear by the pork belly banh mi, the grilled chicken taco and the fried chicken bao. And don't forget the kimchi fries! Best to go there outside of prime lunch hour - either before 11:30 or well after 2. I've been to the Yonge St location too and don't think the quality has suffered there."}
{"text":"I love this place! My only feedback is that the line up is always way too long and the space where you wait for you food is very cramped. The kimchi fries are worth it."}
{"text":"This is a perfect food place combined Asian food and western.I am surprised the young generation can actually do this restaurant good! Keep it up ,boys! I keep my eyes on u!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. I was looking forward to a luxury version of the banh mi's I'm accustomed to in Chinatown. However, I got a lackluster toasted bun, hardly any cilanto, no interesting veggie toppings, and fried pork with a strong spice aftertaste. The layout of the restaurant is a bit weird: you can't see your sandwich being assembled on account of a 5 foot tall wall."}
{"text":"Love their baos and tacos. I had their sandwich a couple of years ago so I can't remember if I liked it or not. However, I just had their baos and tacos a week ago and was impressed. I tried the pork belly bao and the fried chicken bao. On another day I also tried the squid tacos. I liked the flavours especially the pork belly bao. Since it was a take out order, the bao became a little soggy by the times reached the office to eat but it still tasted great. For me, it was good in terms of price and size too."}
{"text":"Came here last week and tried their Clubhouse Bao (not on menu) but if you ask for it, they will serve it in their soft white bahn buns with crispy chicken and grilled pork belly...so good! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Good value. Nice to have options other than subway sandwiches in the ryerson college area. Had the spicy pork belly sandwhich, which was a bit on the salty side. Tofu sandwhich was delicious and didn't need any additional mayo. Fried chicken bun was the best. Cannot go wrong with fried chicken on a bun."}
{"text":"Bahn Mi Boys is done well: clean, contemporary, and they pay homage to big Vietnamese flavor.   Fries are fresh and not over-salted. And the meat is cooked fresh before your eyes.  Bottom line: you get what you pay for: $5+ per sandwich and they're delicious ($2.50 for fries) and it will fill a regular human. If you want to cheap out? Go to Chinatown!"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!!!! Great cheap and quick bite to eat. This place is my go to spot when I'm shopping in the area and I need a quick snack to tie me over. The duck confit is by far the best !!! I highly recommend anyone to try this place.   Happy eating"}
{"text":"Ordered meatball. Super delicious. The meatballs are huge. Really fulfilled. It is tender, yet solid and chewy. Great sauce. Good complement. You won't feel disgusted after finish all the meat.  The cucumber, carrot and another kind of veggie are superb too. Fresh and sweet"}
{"text":"Finally ate here on a Friday night after reading pages and pages of hype in local papers and on the Interweb.  As expected, it was crazy busy but it only took about 10-15 minutes to get my food after ordering - five spice pork belly sandwich and sweet potato fries (came to just over $10 without a drink).  Seating is limited and there were no seats available. Be prepared to scramble for a seat that becomes available or eat outside on the sidewalk or in a park a few blocks away.  The sandwich was good - a nice mix of spices, tender meat and pickled carrots, and a warm baguette - but nothing to go nuts over. The fries were OK.  I'll be back to try some different combinations."}
{"text":"This has been one of my bookmarks for awhile.. And today I was able to go!  I wasn't disappointed and this place lives up to the hype.  I tried the pulled pork and beef tacos with medium spice.  Probably could have used slightly more spice but it was delicious.  The kimchee is a nice addition and makes it unique.  I liked it and I would recommend.  I would like to return to taste a few more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Had 5 spice Pork belly sandwich with sweet potato fries. Didn't expect this restaurant to be so good! Was recommended and will recommend to others! Will have again next time in Toronto!"}
{"text":"So good! Every sandwich I have tried here is very delicious and I keep going back for more. Definitely a staple on my food rotation.  The Spadina store is a little cramped, but other than that, a very enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Some of my favorite food in the city. The kimchi fries are so good. The chicken bao and pork belly bahn mi are delicious. I always bring friends and family here when they're visiting the city. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"1 star off only because of seating. Very limited but I guess that's what keeps the price down and the service moving. Super efficient and extremely tasty junky greasy food but offset with fresh slaw and pickles. Kimchi fries were the boom, Asian style chilli fries elevated to new places. Bao, soft and sweet. Forget, momo- something franchise and head over to this local joint."}
{"text":"This is the most satisfying $8 or less you can spend on food in Toronto and I go here like it's my job.   I've tried pretty much the whole menu and it's all good (I even love the lemon grass braised tofu tacos and I'm not a vegetarian).   This place is already a Toronto institution."}
{"text":"Kimichi Fries ... BOMB! I also love the spicy squid taco! I restrain myself from coming here because its just so unhealthy but food is amazing and good price!"}
{"text":"Went in for a grilled pork Banh mi, my regular pick, and also decided to try the fried chicken bao. The freshness and quality of all of the ingredients push this banh mi well above the ones you can get up the street in China town, and for only a couple of dollars more; well worth the price if you are a fan of this type of sandwich/sub.   The fried chicken bao is something I will certainly go back for. The bao bun/dumpling was steamed and heated to perfection. I was very nicely surprised at how good the chicken was! Not too much breading, and not overcooked. These guys have very high standards for what they serve.   As other users have mentioned, it's great that you can choose your spice level-ranging from, sriracha, jalapeño (my personal favorite for the banh mi), and habanero.   The only reasons I did not give a perfect rating are firstly, that I cannot find any nutritional information on their website.  Secondly, the banh mi sandwiches occasionally come with a little bit too much sauce, which I find delicious yet too salty in higher quantities.   The service and efficiency at both locations is top notch. These guys take what they do seriously and based on the food alone, with a lot of passion."}
{"text":"Really love the pork belly banh mi and the grilled beef one is good too. i don't like jalapeno peppers so i normally get it \"medium hot\" which isn't very hot at all."}
{"text":"Kimchi fries are a must!! And the 5spice pork belly was an amazing mix of flavors. Enjoyed every bite."}
{"text":"This place is always packed. There's limited seating space, so if you wanna eat there, you pretty much have to stand in front of tables to wait for a spot. This is more of a \"grab and go\" place.   Now on to the food. Grilled Chicken Taco = must try! Chicken is flavorful and juicy, a perfect combination with the Taco.   Kimchi Fries are pretty good too, i would recommend sharing with someone tho. Its really filling...  Duck confit banh mi was also pretty good, but i'm not a big fan of the pickled carrots, so i pick a lot of it out."}
{"text":"Awesome little place at Spadina and Queen W. Had the Duck Confit Banh Mi sandwich with sweet potato fries. Very tasty! I'd had been looking forward to trying Banh Mi Boys for quite some time and finally had it today. It didn't disappoint! We need more places like this in Toronto."}
{"text":"Very good selection of fusion vietnamese sandwiches and buns. Price is very reasonable and taste is delicious.  Would recommend the five spice pork Bao at a cost of $3.99. Very good deal.  Will be back for the Kimchi French Fries soon.."}
{"text":"No stop to Toronto should be complete without a good banh mi and these boys know how to serve them up. They have three options for sandwiches- taco, bao and traditional baguette and oh man are the filling options heaven. You can't go wrong really.  My favorites are the spiced pork belly bao with Sriracha or jalapeño, braised beef cheek bao with jalapeño or even the fried chicken bao with Sriracha. On the traditional side I love me some meatballs, pork belly or duck confit. All come with pickled carrots, some with cucumber but all paired perfectly.  Don't forget the kimchi fries, it's not a small portion but Mmmhmm mmmm, yummy.  Need I say more about this place."}
{"text":"Late on Wednesday night we had a huge feed of boas, tacos, and salad. It was busy and like all downtown joints there's not much seating. I'm in love with steamed buns filled will delicious things so the boas were my favorite. Don't forget the sriracha, jalapeno, habanero heat scale."}
{"text":"I have never tried any Vietnamese food before and my friend had made sure we drop by Banh Mi Boys and I'm so glad! For someone who has never tried Vietnamese style food before, I would call the restaurant a perfect and simple way to introduce the taste! Especially for those who don't like to try new things.   Located in a popular area on the Queen West strip, the restaurant is placed conveniently around subway stations and streetcar stops. So if you are coming from out of town you won't miss it as it is very easy to find!   The service was outstanding and the staff was very friendly. I especially enjoyed the service of the cashier who was extremely welcoming and professional! In addition to this, the service was efficient and timely and the food was great. Prices are amazing too as my meal, chicken banh mi and an ice tea, had only cost me $9.04 including tax. The food was filling and the presentation was very simple and nice. The restaurant itself is very clean and offers a fair amount of eat in space.   Overall, my experience here was fantastic and I would totally go back, definitely a must!"}

{"text":"pretty good takeout or sandwich joint. busy at times. I am not a big big fan of the Kimchi fries, but that's just me. everything else i have tried there is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Kim chi fries are amazing! Great and unexpected combo of pickled and fried. Also had the beef sando, par for the course."}
{"text":"Damn,  another 5 stars!  I think this is my second one.  However,  it really only gets 4.5 stars.  Food was excellent,  I had braised beef cheek Bahn Mi with a kalbi taco.  Holy beef cheek!!!  So tender and most.  Tacos were awesome, they use roti instead of a tortilla... Genius!!! The roti is a perfect vessel for Asian style tacos!  How come more shops don't do this!!!??  For real, this is how good it was, I went back for dinner only after 3 hours after we ate lunch there."}
{"text":"One of the best fast food places Toronto has to offer. I'm partial to the banh mi and the bao, but you can't go wrong with anything on their menu."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place after hearing so much about it!  We had the pork belly banh mi, which was extremely tender and flavourful throughout. This was my favourite dish that I tried.  Second was the kimchi fries, which contained a sweet pulled pork and mayo sauce that was to die for!  I also tried the Kalbo taco, which was good but nothing to rave about. This one had a mixture of sauces and kimchi inside.  Overall, I would definitely come back to this place whenever I am in the area"}
{"text":"Yet, another quick lunch with JW in downtown. I love seeing him in the middle of the day.  We went to the very popular Banh Mi Boys for a quick vietnamese sub lunch (I love my viet sub, especially those available at asian supermarkets)! Banh Mi Boys is famous for its fusion vietnamese sandwiches and we really wanted to see what kind of magic Banh Mi Boys has to offer!  Arriving around 12:30, the restaurant was packed with people lining up to buy food. It took us awhile to find a seat, order the food and wait for them to be ready.   We ordered the Kimchi Fries. At first, I was a bit skeptical about how the Kimchi would go with fries, especially when neither of us really like Kimchi b/c of its taste and spiciness.  However, I am surprised to say that they went together like peanut better and jam! I believe that the Kimchi was a modified version; hence, it was not crazy spicy with a reduced taste of the ordinary strong  Kimchi flavour. When mixed with the mayo, it became a very creamy sauce with a hint of kimchi that went harmoniously with the fries! Love it! Also, the fries came with pulled pork which added another dimension of flavour. In our opinion, there were too much pulled pork and we could not finish all of them.   Next, we had the braised beef cheek steamed bao. The bun was really really soft, softer than the cha shu bao available at dim sum places. It felt really good at first, both in the hand and in the mouth. However, it was too soft that it quickly absorbed the sauce of the beef cheek and became very soggy. The bun was sort of unbearable when we were half way through... Nevertheless, the beef cheek was flavourful and tender.   A trip to Banh Mi boys is not completed without trying their Banh Mi! So We ordered their Five Spice Pork Belly Banh Mi. Unlike the vietnamese sub I always have where the bread is severed cold, Banh Mi Boys' baguette was slightly toasted which I actually like more! The crispiness of the bun echoed with the crispiness of the picked carrots. Pickled carrots is one of the reason why I love viet sub so much and Banh Mi Boys did it just right.  Moreover, they added japanese picked cucumber into their Banh Mi which was a good twist to traditional vietnamese sub. But I think it overpowered the pickled carrots.  On the other hand, JW really liked the pork belly which was very tender because of their generous amount of fat.   conclusion:   not roasted.   Although this conclusion may surprise most of you, I believe that Nguyen Huong vietnamese sandwiches are actually better like I mentioned in this post. I might return to Banh Mi Boys for their kimchi fries but it will not be my first choice for vietnamese sub. However, Banh Mi Boys is still a great alternatives for those who normally have ordinary sandwiches for lunch in downtown!  visit http://theroastedacorn.com/2013/02/05/banh-mi-boys/ for awesome pictures of the food i mentioned :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The line up out the door at lunch time tells it all.  I have not had a bad meal here ever.  Five Spice Pork Bao's and Kalbi Banh Mi's yum yum!!  Top it off with Kimchi fries."}
{"text":"Like the kimchi fries, not a fan of how much banh-mi costs. Still tasty though."}
{"text":"I loved the Kimchi Fries ($5.99) the first time I tried it. Fries were good, kimchi not too overpowering, and the pulled pork, mayo, and green onion made the taste even better.   The second time around, though, the fries tasted awful. It ruined the overall taste. I ended up just eating the pork, kimchi, etc. and dumping out the fries.  I had the bao before too. I think it was the 5 spices version. It was pretty good. A bit small, but it might be just right for those with small appetites."}
{"text":"It's been over a week since I went here and I'm already missing the kimchi fries... They were sooooo gooood! I wasn't really sure about the combination of fries with kimchi, but Banh Mi Boys NAILED it! The (Vietnamese?) mayonnaise, (Asian spiced) pulled pork and garnishes really made this dish complete. I went twice here during my five day stay in Toronto and ordered the fries both times.  The Banh Mi sandwiches are delicious as well. I tried a grilled chicken Banh Mi.The chicken was marinated very well and was really tasty. The slightly pickled vegetables made a nice combination with the savoury flavour of the chicken.  The place itself looks very good! Both times I visited it was full and there were lots of people taking out.  Would definitely recommend this restaurant as it offers delicious food for a low price!"}
{"text":"rumours are true! kimchi fries are da bombbbbbb - said by true Korean"}
{"text":"Get the Braised Beef Banh Mi and change your life forever. I love you Banh Mi Boys"}
{"text":"Had the grilled pork bahn mi and the kimchi fries. It was super tasty!!! :) service was quick and the lady at the counter was very friendly!"}
{"text":"I shared the pulled pork banh mi and kimchi fries with a friend for lunch and they were delicious! It was pretty packed but it didn't take too long for us to get our order. Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Banh Mi Boys the other night.  I must say the service was great, super friendly and helpful staff.  We got the kimchi fries $5.99, the kalbi beef taco $3.99, a pork belly steamed bao $3.49 and a braised beef cheek steamed bao $3.49. The kimchi fries (I think there was pulled pork on them) were okay . I really thought the steamed baos would be the highlight of the meal and they were good but the kalbi taco was hands down the best part of the meal.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yea Banh Mi Boys is amazing. Really this is the end of the review. The combination of spices, flavours and textures in unmatched, the kim chi fries are one of a kind and their baos are to die for. The sandwiches are also very good. Just go, this place is awesome"}
{"text":"5 stars for the kimchi fries. Kimchi fries is a misleading name, really this is more comparable to a weird fusion take on a poutine, with pulled pork, kimchi, mayo, and some other stuff piled onto fries. I don't like to think about what the calorie count on this bad boy is, but something keeps me coming back...  The banh mi are also really good, especially the pork belly. It's always full of people eating alone so you know it's that good."}
{"text":"To anybody in Toronto who hasn't tried this - get in there NOW.  There's plenty of places that do cheap Vietnamese sandwiches but these guys kill it.  Their kimchi or chill fries are a must to go with whatever you get, I never strayed far from the pork roll myself.  It's a cool little place, it gets super busy, but it's so worth it.  Living 100 metres down the street was dangerous and what I wouldn't do to go back!!  Highly highly recommended."}
{"text":"Tried 2 of their locations within a span of 24 hours and the consistency in flavours and presentation was on point! I tried the fried chicken bao, 5 spice pork belly boa and sandwich and the duck confit bao. Not one disappointed. The flavour of the lemongrass with the duck; cilantro with the pork; the sweet pickle with the chicken - all amazing! A must try"}
{"text":"Cheap affordable eats that's ready in a relatively fast pace.  Although it's cheap, one does not really fill my friends up. Lots of them get extras to share.   Another down side is the limited seats, sometimes we hesitate to go, as we don't want to eat on the street."}
{"text":"**** 1/2 stars!!  I'm not sure what's taken me this long to visit this place since I knew about it before it even opened. I ordered the pork belly bao, kalbi beef banh mi and the ever-so-famous kimchi fries. I ordered waaaaaay too much for one person! Reading the reviews, I knew that people said the kimchi fries are enough to be a stand-alone meal, but I guess I didn't take everyone seriously enough. Sorry fellow Yelpers...I will trust you guys next time! Needless to say, I had a bit of take home as I only ate half the banh mi and fries. My favourite was the pork belly...so flavourful, tender and just fatty enough without making me feel dirty about myself.  Next time I'm around the area I think I'll have myself another order of kimchi fries....those things are addictive!   Oh, and I would have definitely given this place 5 stars if the food was a little bit cheaper and they had a bigger space with more seating."}
{"text":"This place is great. I had the pork belly sandwich. It was so good. I'm a huge fan of Asian grocery store sub sandwiches and this is along the same lines but with a lot more options and much higher quality.  The sandwich is a great mix of sweet, spicy and crunchy. The bread is amazing and freshly made. The prices are fair, though if they were a bit lower or the portions were a bit bigger I would go more often.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday afternoon, and the tiny store was packed. My friend and I had to take our food to somewhere else so we could sit down and eat.  I tried the kimchi fries and the five spice pork belly bao with extra cilantro - both were awesome, especially the pork belly bao. The pork belly was marinated well, with the refreshing cilantro and pickled carrots, it was  just perfect. Will definitely come back for it."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is generally very irresistible and this location is particularly a killer since one invariably ends up at Queen and Spadina after a night out.  What should one eat? Hm, good question but hard to answer. When I'm with friends, my lazy pick ends up being kimchi fries with pork for the table and individualized sandwiches for the patrons. The sandwiches aren't big enough by themselves, so the delicious fries come in to fill the void.  Tip #1: For the first timers, I'm going to repeat what has been said many times already -  YOU MUST TRY THE KIMCHI FRIES!  Tip #2: If you wanna try the Tofu sandwich, ask them to serve it on a steamed bao - in my opinion tofu tastes much better on bao than on the crusty baguette.  Tip #3: Assign one of your friends on grab-a-table duty since seating is elusive in this perennially packed restaurant."}
{"text":"Arrived ten minutes before noon opening, already a line. We ordered a range of sandwiches-the pork belly bao (wow!), the fried chicken bao, the duck confit and meatball banh mi. Also tried the jicama salad and kimchi fries. The baos were fantastic, the condiments and sauces accented perfectly. All portions were generous and priced fairly. I have to admit I was drawn to the meatball banh mi due to the peanut butter, however I could not detect the taste in the sandwich and was slightly disappointed. The duck confit sandwich was super, enough meat to balance the bread. The fries were tasty however a bit overkill considering the other items we ordered. Jicama salad was refreshing. Really hip place, packed with fans. Loved the retro rap blaring overhead, too. These boys know what they are doing, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Average. They aren't bad but they aren't amazing. It's totally over hyped in Toronto."}
{"text":"I came here with 3 other people. They all ordered the Kalbi beef banh mi ($5.99). I got the grilled pork ($4.99). We also got a side salad ($2.99).  These sandwiches are BIG on perfectly warmed bread, bursting with meat and sweet/sour carrots - they don't skimp on the fillers. When we all started eating I was blown away and immediately said this is the best banh mi I've ever had. My friends thought their sandwiches were just pretty good. Then they all had a bite of my sandwich and were converted.  My review is based only on the 3 items I tried: Grilled Pork Banh mi: best tasting banh mi I've had. Incredibly juicy meat. Possibly there was more sauce on my sandwich than the others for some reason, but the pork itself was juicer and better prepared than the beef. The sauce that results from the meat and whatever spicy thing they put on there and the ...mayo?? (possibly) is phenomenal. I got medium spiciness.  Kalbi beef banh mi: The sandwich I tried was low spiciness (which I don't recommend) and the beef was much drier and less flavorful than the pork. This banh mi is better than most but compared to the pork it was a step down.  Jicama papaya salad (may have gotten the name wrong): Is it worth 3 bucks? No. But it's a crunchy cool complement to spicy meaty food and comes with a sweet dressing.   Loud music, limited seating for how busy it is. A narrow space that gets pretty cramped with the long line. Be aware that when they call your name, they don't have your order ready quite yet - they ask for the spiciness level you want (low-med-high) and I guess put the finishing touches on your food."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is absolutely delicious! My favorites though are pulled pork tacos and kimchi fries! Prices are just right too!"}
{"text":"I pass by this place everyday on my way to school. I have been meaning to give them a try and I am so glad I did. I ordered one of their grilled chicken banh mi sandwiches and regular fries and both were awesome. I'd say that the price of $4.99 for the sandwich and $2.75 for a generous portion of fries were fair given the quality of the food. The sandwich was a nice, large size that will satisfy your appetite. I'd also say that the fries are great because they make them from fresh potatoes, not frozen. (I'm not into spicy food, but apparently they are known for their kimchi fries.)  Staff are all super friendly and fast."}
{"text":"When I moved to Toronto, I was actively looking for a Bahn Mi place that can replace Bahn Mi Saigon in NYC for me and Bahn Mi Boys is it! Love all the Bahn Mis here but my favorite is definitely simple grilled pork (hot).  Pork is nicely seasoned and the baguette is fresh with a crisp exterior and soft interior with enough \"bite\" and the pickles are crunchy enough. The baos are decent too, the bun can be softer and more \"pillowy\" but it is definitely decent."}
{"text":"We finally came on a day when they were not closed or super crowded.  We got the pork belly banh mi and beef cheek bao. We have been to the original Bahn mi boys on Queen St before and expected a similar experience at this Yonge location.  The pork belly Bahni Mi only had 2 relatively small pieces of pork belly, so it was more like a pickles Bahn mi, if they had just added a bit more meat then it would have been good, also the pork belly is called five spice pork belly but it tasted pretty bland. The beef cheek Bao had a nice soft bun, and ample meat so points for that, but the meat was cold and not well seasoned, I think it would have been better hot.  I don't know why it would be different between the two locations, I was soooo excited for Bahn Mi Boys to open in my neighborhood, but it disappoints :(."}
{"text":"My first time tried Vietnamese sandwcih! Must try their kim0chi fries! the food is really fresh and clean!"}
{"text":"I'm always delighted when I am around a Banh me boys and have a hunger. This place is in my wheelhouse, a combo of fresh as heck vegetables/toppings to delicious, salty meats. I absolutely adore steam buns and the ones here are effing satisfying. Like eye rolling oh that's good style. I love pork."}
{"text":"Delicious and inexpensive sandwiches, what's not to love! The kalbi beef is my go-to."}
{"text":"Solid place for lunch. I got the spicy grilled pork banh mi; the meat was succulent, the vegetables were crisp and cold, the baguette provided a nice flavourful vessel. Relatively filling, decent value, got my food quickly. My only gripe however, is that the tables are not that clean.  Overall, was a pleasant experience and I would definitely recommend coming here to get a quick bite."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place, had heard a lot of good things about it.  I've tried vietnamese subs before but always with Vietnamese friends who know the little hole in the wall places that I would never be able to find, this place does a great job of bringing them to the masses.  I had the pork bely gua, teh pork was soft and had just the right amount of fat. I got medium spicy and it wasn't bad at all. I LOVE the radishes on everything and the bun is soft- like the pork buns you get at dim sum. My friends got the baguettes and they were huge. They preferred the beef to the pulled pork as its flavour overwhelmed the sauces etc  I already want to go back to try the 'Tacos' - theres a squid one for under $4!"}
{"text":"Everything has been said but here is my take. I thought this would be a huge rip off, but wanted to try them out for the novelty. Totally worth the price.   I cannot stop thinking about the Kalbi Bahn Mi. At all. I am obsessed. The Pork Belly is decent, has Chinese five spice. Chicken was bland.   Seriously making excuses to go to the west end now.. JUST because of these guys."}
{"text":"Great bao, great banh mi's. Reasonable price. Also love the kimchi fries - such an original dish, but best eaten fresh. We've come back here more than a few times, and definitely felt like it tasted more boring and 'normal' the more used to it we got. However, if you haven't tried this place, you should definitely go check it out. Even though its a small shop, service is friendly and there is a decent amount of space."}
{"text":"Always tasty, reasonably priced, never compromises on quality.  Try the kimchi fries"}
{"text":"I loved Kimchi Fries! Wanna try again~ (FYI I'm Korean ^^)"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is fast food at its best. Cheap & tasty like my women. Love this place."}
{"text":"Keep coming back! Can't get enough of this place. The kimchi fries are to die for. But the baos are just fantastic. Soft pillowy baps with a tiny hint of sweet and crunchy veg made fresh to order. The pork belly with 5 spice is tasty albeit a little fatty (go figure). The fried chicken was a little bland for my taste, even made \"hot\". The braised beef was absolutely beautiful. So full of flavour and meltingly tender. I cannot recommend enough.   I will definitely work my way through this menu. It is so tasty. Fast and fresh. Staff are pleasant. A very enthusiastic thumbs up from me! It is really good value too. 6.50 for fries. 4$ for bao and about 6$ for bahn mi. You can't go far wrong at these prices"}
{"text":"Firstly wow.  Secondly wow.  This place really deserves the credit it gets.  It's so simply yet so delicious.   I got the lemongrass tofu banh mi and tofu fries (same as the kimchi fries but with tofu instead of pulled pork).   For the sandwich the tofu was seasoned great.  And I was a little worried because the bread to ingredients ratio seemed off (too much bread)  but nope!  It's perfect.  The freshness of the toppings are great and the cilantro gives such a great pop.   The tofu fries are exactly what everyone is taking about thought!  The kimchi is such a great topping and the mayo really gives it a nice creaminess,  so good.  I only wish I got the fries sans tofu (with just kimchi,  mayo, and green onions)  since I was pretty stuffed after the sandwich.   I was lucky when I went since it was raining and the place wasn't crowded so I got served right away.  The staff were terrific.  Friendly,  fast and helpful.  A great quick bite.   Can't wait to try the tacos,  they look amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered the regular pork and my date ordered the pork belly. Pork belly was awesome, I highly recommend it. There was a healthy amount of radish and carrots too. The place was clean and happening.  Great for sit down quick bite."}
{"text":"BMB deserves all the great things written about them. I've been close to a dozen times and am usually very content. One time there was simply too much sauce on the sandwich, overwhelming the meat and dripping everywhere - but it never happened again. A few people seem to take issue with the pricing, but for a skillfully prepared hot lunch downtown, it's totally reasonable. You can't compare it to the prices of traditional Vietnamese sandwiches because it isn't one.  Favorite things: Pork Belly Banh Mi  Squid Banh Mi Jicama Salad Kimchi Fries Any of the bao... seriously.  Have yet to try the tacos. Next time!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich.  The place is a minute away from my office and I really would have like to visit more often, but the line up during early afternoon lunch hour has always been discouraging.  The positive thing is they move the line rather efficiently and their assembly line has done a decent job moving the order forward.    The concept is quite clever, Vietnamese banh mi with mixed Asian twisted.  My personal favourites are kalbi beef and five spice pork belly, both are prepared well with delicious filling packed with flavour.  The food is always hot as comparing to traditional Vietnamese banh mi and the sauce is literally dripping.  It is also well seasoned and there are many variety to choose from.  I've never tried their taco or bao but maybe I will try those in the future.  The price is higher than traditional banh mi but I think it's still affordable."}
{"text":"I wanted to be cool and not like this place but I can't help but admit that their food is SO TASTY.   This place is really genius. The food is simple, and easy to make consistently. Their ingredients are fresh and everything is made to order. It's a great place for a meal less than $10. Definitely a fan!  It definitely gets busy, but it's a great place to grab a quick bite - they work really fast behind the counter."}
{"text":"My first time having bao (steamed bread) and have to say it was just as filling as baked bread. The gentleman at the counter recommended that I try the 5 alarm pork belly bao, his recommendation was a good one. It was delicious, and for $3.50, how can you go wrong.  The second decision I made on my own; a pork sandwich on a baguette, this was better than the recommendation. The only thing I would do differently now that I know the place, is try something off the side menu.  They use parsley and carrots on their sandwiches, which is unique, but the taste wasn't overpowering.  This will become one of my regular stops when I visit Toronto; the prices are good and the food tastes great."}
{"text":"Been there for so many times already. The food was great, their kimchi fries and pork/chicken sandwich are highly recommended."}
{"text":"I always keep coming back for their kimchi fries and five spice pork belly banh mi or bao."}
{"text":"What a nice change it was to get a steamed bun with crunchy tofy (my fave and I dont even like tofu!). Their buns are pillow soft and filling, anything on them tasets great, even the beef cheek that is super tender, but seriously go for the crunch tofy steamed bun. Yhe service is good for a caffeteria like lineup, which can get a bit congested as it is all the way in the back of the store. All in all worth a trip."}
{"text":"I've never had a $2 banh mi sub because mystery meat is repulsive. So, I'm comparing this to what you can expect to get in the neighbourhood for $6--hence, the five stars as Queen & Spadina sucks for cheap lunch spots.  They have cherry and vanilla Coke, which is nice. The guys are super friendly and enjoy recommending how to dress each particular banh mi or taco. Three of my coworkers and I were in and out in ten minutes with our take-out subs but that will likely take five or ten minutes longer once this place inevitably blows up and the lineup starts to stretch out the door.  The five spice pork belly was amazing, with three large chunks of fatty meat crammed into a fresh, crunchy baguette. The kimchi was a perfect compliment (obviously). The pulled pork was given two thumbs up all around. I was the only one to not get it. One of my coworkers got the sweet potato fries, and they were not bad and the portion was enormous for $3.  I'll be eating here twice a week until it becomes unbearably busy. Next time I'm going to destroy two kalbi tacos, and I apologize in advance to anyone who will bear witness to that gruesome spectacle."}
{"text":"simple and small restaurant. I live close by and we had lots of expectations about this place after high praises from some of my fiancee's co-workers. I have never been to the store in Queen West, so I cannot compare with the original but my experience here was just OK. I was easy to find a table to seat despite the small room. the menu is simple: 4/5 different types of meat served on Bahn Mi,  Taco or Steamed Bao. We decided to try the beef cheeks and the pork belly. The beef cheeks order was wrong and they gave me pulled pork, we were late so I decided not to complain. the pork was tasty but the spices were a bit overpowering. The pork belly was delicious, juicy and with a good fat component. In both cases the bread needed more spread to be a bit softer and it was covered with cilantro (way too much!!). We also ordered the Kimchi fries and the sweet potato fries! They are the only reason I value my experience on the positive side. The Kimchi fries were crispy and covered with pulled pork, kimchi  and mayo (a bit too much mayo), perfectly salted. It was a magical bite: the crispiness of the fries combined with the spiciness of the kimchi and the meaty flavor of the pork. There was a party on my taste buds! The sweet potato fries was very crispy, which is rare to find. Kudos for that! On the negative side, I should mention the service: after placing the order at the counter no one told me that we had to wait for the sandwich on the side. Before they serve you they should ask you how spicy you want your sandwich but no one did it. Overall, a (relatively) cheap, tasty enough restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been thinking about this place for a while now...and I am starting to salivate.  If you've never had banh mi -- then you'll want to try this modern version of the traditional vietnamese sub!  Must try: Kim-chi fries! If you have a craving for french fries that are savoury, crunchy and have an asian-zing to it...then this is definitely worth trying! It is best shared amongst friends or significant others!"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys has a wide selection of banh mi to choose from, and a good variety of sides. The space is inviting and the staff is friendly.   I was not impressed with the Kalbi Beef banh mi that I ordered. It was alright, but seemed a little dry and I've had better banh mi elsewhere in Toronto.   Try the:  - Kimchi Fries: It's almost like Kimchi poutine. It's heavy, but the flavour is good."}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese and I never really like \"banh mi\" in Toronto. My sister recommendation \"kimchi fries\" and I should said \"Wow\". The crispy of fries + sweet and spicy of Kimchi are turning out amazing. It is a must try for every visit. I also had grill pork \"banh mi\" which I feel is ok. Two orders cost me around $13.56. Would love to come back again to try the duck \"banh mi\" soon at this place. I give it 5 stars because of the price, the cleanliness, the fast and friendly of the cashier. Good place for something quick"}
{"text":"I dig this place hard, even though I became vegetarian/vegan recently.  Lemongrass tofu and sweet potato fries are super tasty-delish"}
{"text":"I've finally gave this place a try even though it is so close to me. No line ups during dinner time. I ordered the pork belly bao and the kimchi fries. My food came pretty quick.  I love these bao that are half bun and not the entire thing covered. The sauce was good, I just wish there was more pork belly fat on the meat. The kimchi fries was amazing with the pulled pork. It was a very satisfied meal. Good place for a quick and good meal."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot!  Kalbi Beef and Duck Confit Bahn Mi are my two favourites with a side of kimchi fries.  Better than any other sub or sandwich joint in this area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always come here when we want something fast and yummy. He's tried everything here and loves it. I usually go for the duck salad since it's a bit more healthy. The duck is amazing and I love their salad base. Not the typical lettuce leafs. Overall, 5/5 considering its cheap, delicious, and fast :)"}
{"text":"Fried chicken bao and the kimchi fries have become a weekly staple for me"}
{"text":"Top Notch! Despite 2 attempts and find the place closed (even though the sign said it's open on Saturday!) I was a bit peeved about that. Finally, I get to try this place this weekend. All is forgiven. It was awesome. Quality Banh Mi."}
{"text":"We are lucky to find a car park right in front of the store.  There is a line up and almost no table left.  The Five Spice Pork Belly Banh Mi is delicious though I can't tell all the 5 spices. The Kalbi Beef Banh Mi of course is also yummy.  One item not to miss is the Kimchi Fries which is a bit addicted.  Eating Kimchi and Fries as an item doesn't know that the blend mix of these two can be so attractive.    Lot of people and lot of garbage.  The garbage is totally full and split out on the floor.  From the start of my meal till the end, no one is going to clean it.  Just let the garbage sit there.  What a store !"}
{"text":"I've had better Banh Mi in the city. However, the kimchi fries are incredible. That being said, eat them in-store or they can be soggy."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!! We bring our friends that are from out of town to this place every time!  So different and unique! Quick, great price and GREAT food!"}
{"text":"Their five spice pork belly steamed bao is one of my favourite dishes. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"BEST Kimchi Fries ever! Ingredients include some pork I think? They're listed as sides but the portions are pretty big, probably enough to feed 2 people for lunch."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, especially this location!  We go back for their baos pretty often. Favourite is the fried chicken bao, but the tofu and beef are some other great options. It's a great snack for a very reasonable price. The banh mi are tasty and filling. Bonus: the employees who work at this location are always friendly.   Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Overrated and overhyped.. I had better Banh Mi from Chinatown.  1st thing the bread is too big and they put more of the pickled carrots and stuff than the meat.  Go easy on it. Also the baguette they use is too big. The only thing I like is the kimchi fries."}
{"text":"Really love their food. Ordered the Lemongrass Tofu Bahn Mi, Kalbi Beef and Tofu Tacos, and Panko Tofu Steamed Bao. Wished I could order by phone, had to show up in person to order and pickup. My team loved the food - vegetables and all. Super tasty!"}
{"text":"I love the food here! It's always fresh and tasty. You can go lighter with their grilled chicken and tofu options. The calamari taco is my favourite, the pork belly and chicken bao are delicious! I don't love the fries, too gooey. Staff is awesome, there this one girl at the cash that makes an effort to remember every customers name - she's great, very friendly folks! This place is a must!!"}
{"text":"Fairly priced, fast service, and absolutely tasty! I ate the Five-Spice Pork Belly sandwich and my taste buds exploded. Sweet, salty, tangy and spicy - all in my mouth at once...it was glorious. I can't wait to go back to try the famous kimchi fries soon!"}
{"text":"Hungry for some Vietnamese sandwich  We took the famous Kimochi fries And braised beef (tender) banhmi  Ouf the banhmi fills you up so much , crazy tasty  The kimchi fries really creative and unique, I like.  Must go back for the steamed bao  Really nice decoration"}
{"text":"Spent the entire morning looking forward to trying some of their renowned gourmet banh mi! Their lunch line wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, still took about 15 mind to get to my order but it was worth it! Got the panko tofu bao definitely worth it though for most people it would not be enough, I suggest the banh mi which are generously sized =D.  Expect to take your food to go as there are very few tables."}
{"text":"I remember having Vietnamese sandwiches as a child, and I was always a fan even though I didn't know what type of cold cuts were used. But now them with kalbi beef or lemongrass chicken they are great.  The bao sandwiches are also great if you want something smaller. Just don't forget to get the KIMCHI fries, try it and you will see."}
{"text":"An update to my previous review:  I guess other people made the same complaint I made, about naming something \"veggie\" when it is not vegetarian, as they have renamed the \"Veggie Kimchi Fries\" to \"Tofu Kimchi Fries.\" It is still not vegetarian. In my opinion, since it's posted next to the regular kimchi fries, clearly suggesting it as the vegetarian alternative, a little asterisk that says \"kimchi contains fish ingredients\" would be nice.  Anyway, tofu bahn mi remains tasty as the only vegetarian main on the menu.  UPDATE: I looked at my receipt and saw that there was a 4 cent \"rounding fee\". This disturbs me for a number of reasons: 1 - yes, we did away with the penny, but the formality is to round UP or DOWN a maximum of 2 cents, whichever is closer - this way, everyone gets a fair shake. Rounding UP 4 cents? That's a little uncouth. 2 - MORE IMPORTANTLY, I paid on credit card. The non-existence of pennies should not affect card purchases AT ALL.  Do they charge every single patron 4 cents for literally nothing? Seriously, that could add up to a few grand in a year of transactions. A few extra grand for literally nothing. If you want to charge more, raise your prices, don't put silly needless fees on every transaction."}
{"text":"My friend has been telling me about this place for about 2 months now.  She works in the area and goes at least twice a week.   So last night, just before we went to the movies, we finally tried it.  We were in a group of 3 girls.  Seating is very limited, so your best bet is probably to get take out and eat it on a nearby bench.    That is my only \"negative\" for this place, hence the 4/5 rating.  From here on in, it's all amazing all the time!  My mouth was watering as I stood in line and checked out the menu.  I'm obsessed with Korean food, so the Kalbi beef Bahn mi caught my eye immediately...as did the Kimchi fries.  My heart hurts a little as I write this, because at the very last second, I opted to get the sweet potato fries instead!  I know...shocking!  My reasoning for such a heinous act?  My two girlfriends don't eat meat...so I figured we could at least share them.  The Kimchi fries have pulled pork on them...totally unshareable with Veggie Friends.  i wil get you next time, Kimchi Fries...oh yes...I will!  Each bite was delicious!  And for a person who loves spicey food like me, thie kalbi beef bahn mi had just the perfect amount of kick to it.  My mouth is actually watering as I write this and it's only 9:42am...I think this might what the beginning stages of a drug addiction must feel like!  I digress.    For first timers gearing up to visit The Boys...here are a few little things you should know...that I didn't...and kinda felt like a very green \"rookie\".  First of all, don't call it a sandwich...it's a Bahn Mi....  So call it that.  I  felt like I kind of insulted the guy taking my order when I almost said \"can I get the Kalbi Beef...sand...\"  He promptly corrected me (not in a rude way at all...just totally informatively) that \"it's called a bahn mi\".  Also, they ask how spicy you want it just before they make your order...  I got the Thai Red Chillies....DELICIOUS!  Next time, I'm going to tackle a couple of the tacos.  And then the time after that I'm going get the Steamed bao...then, the time after that...."}
{"text":"Had the Banh Mi Five Spice Pork Belly sandwich.   Sadly like many sandwiches in Toronto it suffered from a serious meat to bun ratio problem.   The sandwich was ok flavour wise don't get me wrong but it wasn't anything that I would go running back for due to the lack of filling.   It didn't take many bites to run out of pork belly and then it was all bun with some shredded carrot topping and cilantro. It drives me nuts when places skimp on the meat.   Maybe I got someone who doesn't make the best ones or maybe as someone told me I should have tried the other location I really don't know.  All I can say is where's the meat yo!?"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere.  Lineups get busy at lunch and dinnertime but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"My go-to restaurant for a quick and delicious meal. Never fails to disappoint!  The staff are very friendly and fast at taking orders. Both the baos and banh mi are absolutely delicious! The taste is always consistently delicious. Large portions and good quality food at a great value."}
{"text":"Tired this place out this past weekend.  Very unique tasting sandwiches. We had the grilled chicken sandwiches.  Zesty and full of flavour! Also, yes, try the kimchi fries for sure."}
{"text":"This is amazing fast Vietnamese fusion food! The kimchi fries are always a must for me; they come packed with lots of puled pork and kimchi. The portion is huge for the price and definitely worth it. I normally go for the bao over the bahn mi, but both are good. The pork belly is to die for and the fried chicken is amazing. The food never disappoints and the prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"The layout is a bit awkward when the place is full but the food is amazing. It would be helpful if the staff could implement some sort of table system so customers aren't quarelling with each other.  Love the food nonetheless!"}
{"text":"On a recent visit, I came around 11ish for an early lunch and specifically to beat the lunch crowd.  This location may be slightly larger than the flagship location at Queen and Spadina, but seating is still quite limited.  And I can only imagine how busy it can get because of the location at Yonge & Gerrard.  Cashier was friendly, fast and efficient like always.  I like the fact the cashier takes your name instead of giving you a number to remember from a receipt.  Plus who doesn't like to be called by their name as it's always nice to hear your name being called instead of a number.  My food was ready in a reasonable amount of time and the food taste just as consistent each and every time.  I think I tried most of the banh mi, steam baos are great (especially pork belly and braised beef), but I have yet to try their tacos, so I will have to try those next time.  I would definitely recommend the kimchi fries, it sounds unappetizing, but it really is so delicious and the flavours just mix so well together. The sweet potato fries and jicama papaya salad is also tasty too, so if you have an appetite, order extra sides as you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. Bathroom clean.  Extremely busy at lunch time.  Must have:  fried chicken Bao Kim chi poutine fries Five spice pork belly  Nothing to complain about. Just good food at very reasonable prices.  Must go! I mean now!"}
{"text":"My favourite menu modification: order the grilled chicken inside the steamed bao! It's flavourful, sweet, savoury, and the bao isn't as heavy as the banh mi baguette.   Order two of these, and this is one of the best quick lunches you'll have in Toronto!"}
{"text":"After the temporary one opened up and I got food poisoning, I was hesitant to give this place another shot. But everything I heard about the place after it re-opened was amazing...so I had to go! Ok the duck confit banh mi won me over, the duck was freaking amazing...along with the comforts of the rest of the Vietnamese sandwich. The kim chi fries is over the top, share them if you don't want to become uber fat :)   Great job BMB, you really pulled off delicious banh mi with new combinations. The pork belly baos are great, I can't wait for more restaurants to have these in Toronto (though baohaus will always be better in my heart)"}
{"text":"Great flavors but I found that there wasn't enough meat in the sandwitches."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I found it thanks to Yelp and am so glad I decided to come here. I went for the 5 spice pork belly band mi and I loved it. Every bite had just the right amount of pork belly with picked carrots, cucumbers and other veggies. I also got the tofu kimchi fries and it's like a healthier and super interesting take on poutine. The prices here are very very reasonable and the portions are not too small either."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place while I was in Toronto. I went for an early lunch, after hearing that it could be crowded. I ended up getting the grilled pork  banh mi, amd the jicama papaya salad. The salad was much better than I would've expected, with plenty of flavour and fresh ingredients. The banh mi was good, but not great in my opinion. There was definitely plenty of meat and sauce, but it seemed to have much less influence from herbs that would normally be in a banh mi. I think next time I will order the steamed buns."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong at Banh Mi Boys. These people know how to run a restaurant!  The place is clean, friendly and the pricing is pretty fair for what you get. Most of all; everything on their menu is quite good. I've been going here regularly since it opened.   You might have to wait a bit but that's only because the place is pretty damn busy at lunch."}
{"text":"I was super stoked that BMB was walking distance from where I was staying while visiting TO.   Reading all the reviews and looking at the mouthwatering photos, I couldn't wait to try this place out and contribute mine as well.  Torn between the bao and banh mi, I went with the pork belly bao so I could also have the tofu fries (which by the way is more than enough for 2 people, I clearly was thinking with my stomach when I ordered)  The bao was perfection. The pork belly was crisp & savoury and the crunch of the cucumber, carrots and pickles added a nice texture to the pillowy soft bao bun.  You guys, these tofu/kimchi fries are the bomb.com. Kimchi, tasty tofu, mayo and green onions are packed on a pile of crispy fries. It's a lot though, so like I said, this one is best for sharing.  I wish I had the opportunity to try their banh mi, but that just means I have another reason to visit TO again right? :)"}
{"text":"seriously?  maybe just call it a hoisin sub love in!  bleh"}
{"text":"Solid Viet sub place. Kalbi beef tasted great and their house sauce really adds a kick. For less than 6 bucks it's a sweet deal. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I opted to try this place because I've heard it's delicious, but also because it was on You Gotta Eat Here. The food was so good!  I took my sister here when she was visiting and she loved it too! I ordered the Grilled Chicken bahn mi. The ingredients on my sandwich tasted fresh, and REAL. Nothing fake here! And the amount of fries you get in one order, is enough to share with two people! Good prices too, not too expensive for the quality of food you get. Will be coming back here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Very average. I tried pork sandwich with kimchi fries, honestly nothing special don't know why the ratings are so high. Also when you order for in, you have to pick it up from kitchen which is annoying. Don't believe the hype."}
{"text":"Perfect sandwich shop. I'm a double stuffed grilled pork kinda guy. So consistent and reasonably priced. The buns are good, too! If you really want to over do it, you should order the club banh-mi, which is pork-belly and fried chicken. It is very crowded so I order it ahead on ritual and pick up....no nonsense !"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is one of the most incredible spots to grab lunch! The prices are great, the staff are young and energetic, and the food is incredible! I recommend grabing a grilled pork bahn mi and the kimchi fries."}
{"text":"Best banh mi sandwiches I have ever had... I kept coming back. Perfect baguette with bbq pork, spicy, tangy perfection"}
{"text":"I swear this place puts crack in their food, I can't get enough of it and keep going back for more. Everything is delicious and always a line up although they move it quite quickly."}
{"text":"This is the better of the two Banh Mi Boys. Less busy, a bit more space (or so it seems - the former may feed into the latter, or vice versa). The staff is friendly and know how to put together a banh mi sandwich or bao. I am partial to the fried chicken bao, which has all the salty protein and sweet bao you want, topped with cucumber, sweet pickles carrots, and mayo. These take longer to make than other bao but it's worth it. The kimchi fries make a nice addition to share it otherwise just get yourself two fried chicken bao, a vanilla or cherry coke, and call it a meal."}
{"text":"I will 10000% be back! One of the best things I've ever had! Ordered the chicken bao bun and the panko tofu bao bun (my favourite) and both we amazing. Definitely recommend!!! Thank you for making such delicious food"}
{"text":"Oh so tasty!  I know its got be a million calories but I don't care! Favs are the kimchi poutine which is phenomenal and the pork tacos.  The bahn mi sandwiches are good but not the best.  Prices very reasonable so prepare for long waits."}
{"text":"Some friends and I were searching for food late at night when we stumbled across this place. I ordered Kimchi Fries, not sure what to expect. They were fantastic, and better than any poutine I've ever had (sorry Canada). The staff were amazingly friendly and looked like they really enjoyed their job and chatting with customers. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Got three orders of Kimchi fries to go one night. I had bragged about how amazing this shit was to my girl and some friends like a million times.   I shit you not, I get all the way down to the Harbourfront, sit down and we open the boxes. No fucking kimchi on any of the motherfuckin fries! NONE!  I went back a few days later and just mentioned it to the bitchy girl at the counter while I was ordering. She says,\"Why didn't you just bring it back? YOUR TOTAL is...\" And that was it. No apology, no fuck was given. A simple apology would of been great, but she didn't give a fuck. You're fucking lucky I like your god damn food so much or I would of raised hell.   MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR TAKE OUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE"}
{"text":"I went with a friend and we ordered: 1 grilled pork banh mi 1 duck confit banh mi 1 five spice pork belly steamed bao 1 kimchi fries  Banh Mi The grilled pork was very flavorful and definitely suited the taste of banh mis. The vegetable toppings are similar to the traditional banh mis so nothing too special there. I really wanted to try the duck confit, but alas, I should have known better that duck confit and banh mi do not go together so well. The duck confit was very tasty but was not very suited to a banh mi sandwich. The size of the banh mi is also REALLY big, so if you plan on ordering something else, I would share.  Steamed Bao The five spice pork belly was delish! But my steamed bao was cold - very unexpected. :( I would definitely try the five spice pork belly banh mi next time and skip on the steamed bao.  Kimchi Fries TO DIE FOR!!! THEY ARE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOD! they are topped with kimchi and pulled pork, and big enough to share with someone!! DEFINITELY MUST TRY! The pulled pork was made perfectly and the fries were really crisp.. YUM!  Do note that the store isnt' very big, so during lunch hour, it's VERY busy there.. I noticed most people get take out. I went around 1:30 and was lucky to get a seat."}
{"text":"Generous portions of meat and fast service. Location was a bit cramped near the cashier, even when it wasn't busy inside.   Everything else about the ban mi was about as expected from an average vietnamese sub."}
{"text":"Awesome place for a casual quick lunch. They play good hip hop here and the staff is friendly. I love their pork belly Banh mi and sweet potatos fries. If you want something a bit less calorie dense go for the Jicama salad, it is fresh, spicy and surprinsingly filling. I've heard the kimchi fires are super yummy.. I must try them soon..,eat all the FRIES!"}
{"text":"I come here for one thing and one thing only, Grilled Pork Banh Mi.  Perfectly grilled lemongrass pork that is tender and juicy, pickled cucumber and carrots, house made Asian BBQ, and cilantro.  It is just pure heaven in a baguette!  The Banh Mi Boys team is always friendly and personable.  No matter how busy, they always make you feel welcome and get your order out as fast as they can.  Although the place is tight, but customers are generally courteous and understanding when waiting for a table.  Tasty and reasonably priced.  This is one of the best joints in town, in my book!"}
{"text":"When I heard words swirling around about Banh Mi Boys' second location, I was hoping it would be somewhere in the downtown-Yonge street area.  Next thing I know, I was walking from home toward Gerrard and Yonge for BMBs soft opening day.  The menu is the same.  More importantly, the Grilled Pork Banh Mi still tastes as good as ever.   The overall interior design is very similar to the first location, with more seatings (about 30?) and a small patio.    What a great addition to the Downtown Yonge area!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch. The line is always long, so expect at least 15 minutes wait in a small claustrophobic place. I got the kimchi fries and kalbi bahn mi on my first trip. I love the house made white sauce on the kimchi fries, but not really digging the overall sogginess of the dish because of the kimchi. Perhaps they could drain the kimchi more? The bahn mi is outstanding. The bun is perfectly baked. Not too tough crust with an overall soft texture. The beef was a little bit tough, but it was okay overall.  I tried the duck on my second trip and I have to say that I like this more than the beef. It's softer, so I don't feel like I'm fighting with my food when I bite it. The sauce also taste smoother. Probably cause it's easier for duck meat to absorb it.  Overall, I would definitely come back if I'm in the area. I'm so happy that there's more choices for foodies around the queen-spadina area. No more fast food burgers and overpriced all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"Very yummy! Cafeteria style...flow from ordering to food pick up a bit squishy. I went with a big group. We managed to grab 50% of the seats. We were lucky. Really set up for a 15min quick munch or take out. You choose a taco, bao or bun \"vessel\"  to fill with a good selection of meat fillings with crunch veg! I had a 5 spice pork ban mi. Liked the pickled daikon. Very fresh and tasty. Had all the necessary components for a good ban mi. Sauces were there but not noticeable. I was most impressed with fried chicken bao for less than $5?! Wow! Good portion size...will go back just for that again...and again. Tacos looked sloppy...but were a popular choice for a less \"bready\" option."}
{"text":"Loved it! I tried Kalbi Beef which comes comes with kimchi in it. I got medium spicy which was just exactly the right amount of spicy for me."}
{"text":"I decided to try BMB due to all the good reviews on yelp..   Well, I'm not 100% convinced this place is amazing as everyone says.. I ordered the braised pork belly sandwich and the jicama and papaya salad. While the sandwich was pretty good, I wouldn't say it's THE best sandwich I've ever had.. I've had these Vietnamese sandwiches before, and they've been so tasty and flavourful. I couldn't taste the five spice that the pork belly is braised in. The pork belly was a bit tough and chewy.  The jicama and papaya salad wasn't anything special.. It was essentially just shredded jicama and papaya with some coriander (cilantro) thrown on, and the dressing consisted of sweet chilli sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, lime / lemon juice and sugar.. Didn't really do it for me.  So while everything I ordered was good, it wasn't ah-mazing.."}
{"text":"If I had to describe Banh Mi Boys (BMB) food in one word, it would be AMAZING! BMB offers up a menu of common lunch items found in both western and eastern cuisine but with the added twist of combining them together to form its own unique and original brand of delectable fusion cuisine.   To put it simply, BMB revamps common lunch items such as french fries and sandwiches. Examples include Kimchi fries which can be regarded as a delectable alternative to poutine or chili fries. Another example would be the meatball banh mi sub or pork belly steam bao which are similar to sandwiches found at local fast food restaurants, but with an added Asian flare.  I remember the first time I stepped into BMB restaurant, I was a bit apprehensive about trying the food as I wasn't sure if I would like it and thought that I could possibly be wasting my money. But the second I sunk my teeth into a banh mi sub, those apprehensions quickly turned into delight as I realized that I have just found a great and new restaurant that I would become a regular of.   With money in mind, I need to mention that all food items come at bargain prices with lunch goers being able to purchase a filling meal for $10 and under. If you are looking for a great, and dare I say, better alternative to the usual burger and fries lunch fare, be sure to check Banh Mi Boys out, I'm sure you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I'm so glad they opened up near work. It's great for a quick and cheap lunch! I could eat bao every day! Bbq pork belly is so delicious. I also like the fact that they have vanilla and cherry coke."}
{"text":"I've driven and walked past this place so many times and finally decided to go in with a friend one day after I had a craving for some Banh Mi. Place was small, and looked trendy. Service was fast and polite. It was busy as hell when I went so we didn't get to sit down. Kim Chi fries were alright, a lot greasier than I'd like. I had the Chicken and my friend had the Pork. It wasn't as \"breathtaking\" as my some of my other friends described it.  I guess this place caters to people who never had good Banh Mi before...It's was worth a try for my craving, but I'm not gonna go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  I really enjoyed the pulled pork kimchi taco and the kimchi fries!   Yum."}
{"text":"Great prices and large portions. I like the grilled pork banh mi the best. The pork belly banh mi sounds good in theory but ours was kind of dry."}
{"text":"This little shop, famous for its Vietnamese Sub Sandwiches, also called Banh Mi has been making waves in Toronto since it opened its first store in 2011.  Their menu is simple with three different items - Banh Mi, Steamed Baos and Tacos with various ingredients.   They have an open kitchen, which we personally like as we can see how everything is made.  It's also a sign of a honest restaurant that's proud of their fresh ingredients and transparent cooking.   Five Spice Pork Belly Banh Mi, is braised pork belly and pickled radish served on baguette, house mayo, picked carrots, cucumber and cilantro.  The pickled veggies really bring out the flavours of the main ingredient - pork belly.  The baguette is very soft and easy to bite into.  It is unbelievably delicious.  Galbi Beef Banh Mi, which consists of marinated short ribs, kimchi and asian BBQ sauce with pickled cucumber, carrots and cilantro.  This was really tasty as well!  I usually HATE cilantro (people usually love it or hate it) but I didn't mind it at all on this sandwich.  These sandwiches are priced pretty low and you get a good portion out of it.  The marinated galbi was my favourite of the two as it had more flavours, probably from the marinated galbi!  We had to get the Kimchi Fries to share.  It's basically fries with pulled pork, kimchi, green onions and mayo.  Sounds simple enough but the combination of flavours really entice your taste buds.  It's a must-try at this place!  We would go back just for the fries."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Banh Mi Boys Cuisine: Asian Location: Queen West Address: 392 Queen St W Price Range: ~$10  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellen  Food: 3 Service: 3  Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3  Everyone seems to rave about Banh Mi Boys. They've been open for awhile and I remember being intrigued by their menu selection. With the Banh Mi/Bao/Asian Taco still going strong in food trend, Banh Mi Boys were first few to jump on the train specifically for those items.  First thing I noticed when I walked in is how smokey it was inside. Maybe there is something wrong with the ventilation but I felt like something was burning in the kitchen. I already knew I would end up smelling like what I ate even before I put in my order.  They have limited seating area so it might be best to just grab and go which a lot of people seemed to be doing. They have lots of drink options inside the cooler across from order table you can choose from. There were couple of us and we divided Banh Mi, Taco and Steamed Bao with few side options.  Ordered: KimChi Fries 4/5  * French fries served with pulled pork, sweet mayo, kimchi, green onion and cheese for $5.99 * Reminded me of baked potato toppings plus kimchi * This is labelled as a side, but it's pretty big in portion * Would be good to share between 2 people * It is fusion dish, but the flavor stays true to all components of the dish * Overall it is a strange combination, but it went very well together * Must try when you visit   Ordered: Braised beef Cheek Steamed Bao 2/5  * Served with cucumber, pickled carrots and cilantro for $3.49 * Bao is quite big but it doesn't have much filling * There wasn't much sauce to this so it lacked a lot of flavor * It didn't help that the bun was soggy on the bottom * Overall very dry, I didn't enjoy this very much   Ordered: Five Spice Pork Belly Banh Mi 3/5  * Braised pork belly and pickled radish served on baguette with house mayo for $ 5.99 * There wasn't much pork belly inside the Banh Mi * Bread was pretty good, but just not enough filling (even the vegetables) * Overall very dry Banh Mi   Ordered: Kalbi Beef Taco 3/5  * Served with purple cabbage slew, kimchi, pickled carrots and cilantro for $3.99 * They use chinese pancake instead of the tortilla taco which was def interesting * Lots of vegetables topped with spicy sauce * It was good in terms of flavor but kalbi beef was nowhere to be found  Summary: I love Banh Mi, I love Korean tacos....but Banh Mi Boys didn't really do it for me. Maybe it's because they just opened? I felt like their food lacked quality even for a casual restaurant. I would go back for the KimChi fries because it is something different but if I was craving Korean tacos, I am spending few more dollars and going to Swish by Han."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants of all time! If I could give them 6/5 stars, I would. The duck confit banh mi is SO GOOD. The pickled vegetables add a perfect tang and the meat is really tender  with a nice fatty flavour without being oily. And the kimchi fries?! A MUST. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I go here when I feel like it. Most of the time for take out.  Food: The kimchi fries are quite yummy, I don't eat a lot so I prefer to share them with another person. It is amazing how the light mayo, fries and kimchi work out together, for some it may not be the most appetizing mix. I got sweet potato fries from here before, I am not very picky on greasiness so no opinion on those, you have the option of dipping them in the light mayo or ketchup. Often I would order the steamed bao, I prefer the fried chicken and five spice pork belly. I have never tried the banh mi from here, I like to stick to the regular kind for cheaper somewhere else.  Atmosphere & Service: The staff give off a hip hop vibe and work very efficiently. After ordering, you move to the inside where they prepare your food behind the counter and wait for your name to be called. The graffiti artwork on the wall is colourful and cool to observe. When your name is called, they ask how spicy you want your food to be.   Pricing: The contents in their banh mi has more variety so I guess it is understandable that they are priced more than the regular ones you find else where. Prices for other items are reasonable."}
{"text":"Must add to your lunch list!  I have been to this place 2 times now. Both times I had Kimchi fries, and now crave them on a regular basis and have got other gals at my work hooked too.   I have only got takeout here which has  been quick, cheap and delicious. I don't think I would sit here unless I needed to, as the restaurant is usually quite noisy and packed with people getting take out.   All of the items are made fresh and are very reasonably priced. They customize your orders based on how spicy you'd like it.  The tacos are also lovely and full of flavour.  Staff are always friendly and they get the orders out fast.   Will be going back again getting Kimchi fries for myself and the gals I work with!   Many locations around the city, check them all out."}
{"text":"Had kimchi fries and pork belly pao. Was so good went back in and tried the duck confit sandwich. Cannot go wrong. Will be making the hour drive to get again real soon"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan! I'm so glad they opened at Yonge and Gerrard!  At this visit, I had a squid taco and kimchi fries. Squid was fried and had some kind of amazing mayo-sauce, with cilantro, pickled carrots, cabbage, in a soft corn taco. It was on the small side, but I was satisfied (I have a medium appetite, but wasn't that hungry that day).   I also had an order of kimchi fries which was...decadent. Salty, sweet, spicy, and fatty all at once. That's all I have to say. It's really a meal in and of itself. This is what I look for after a late night out!  It would be spectacular if they extended their opening hours!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite spots. I love the KimChi Fries and the Pork Belly Bao. Great for lunch and there is speedy service."}
{"text":"Delicious food, hits the spot for a quick snack. The staff are all young, and friendly, and seem to fit the vibe that banh mi boys is going for. Not somewhere I go too often, it is delicious none the less and is definitely worth a visit.   The club bao is delicious. Absolutely go for it if you are there. I always get mine Mild, as I can't take any spice, and it's great because they put sriracha on the mild sandwhiches, which is delicious."}
{"text":"The one negative that is a positive is the fact that I live at East Scarborough and I'd have to go downtown to eat here.  If it were easily accessible, I'd be morbidly obese.  Whenever I am near the area though, and especially when I'm with someone who hasn't been here, I make it a point to take them here.  Service is always good and food never disappoints.  Fried Chicken Bao: A great starter for the noobs who aren't as adventurous when it comes to food.  This was actually the first thing I tried here on my very first visit and it was very good.  Though it looks small, it's pretty filling.  The chicken is perfectly fried to a crisp while the meat is still juicy.  Bao is always nice and fluffy.  5/5.  Squid Taco: Alright, so this taco is the TRUTH! My boy told me about this after I mentioned to him that I went here and loved it.  A must-try for any seafood lover.  You get a good amount of fried squid and the shell it comes in is also very delicious and not overly greasy.  This is my go-to item off the menu at every visit. 5/5.  Kimchi Fries: I'm personally not a big fan of kimchi but these fries are also a must-try.  It's a big serving so 2 people can share this.  Just writing this review is making me want some. 5/5."}
{"text":"Went here on the weekend with a friend of mine who has been dying to try the place and I'm happy to say that she enjoyed it very much.   Service here is always pleasant which makes the trips even more enjoyable.   Kimchi Fries - Although I'm not supposed to have potatoes, I couldn't help but order this again just so my friend could also try it. It's a great portion for its price plus it's damn good! And I'm not even a big fan of kimchi! 5/5  Fried Chicken Bao - Had this the first time I came here and enjoyed it very much. Chicken was perfectly seasoned and fried. Bao was also steamed to perfection. 5/5  Kalbi Bao - My friend ordered this one and it was also really good. For its portion, though, it could've used more meat. 5/5  Squid Taco - After my first visit, a friend of mine told me to have this next time so I ordered it. And I must say that it is one of the best things I've ever had. The taco \"shell\" is very similar to Indian paratha which was great since it didn't break while eating. The squid rings/calamari were nicely breaded and fried to a crisp. Was also not oily as I was expecting. The taco was also garnished with a nice type of coleslaw and was also drizzled with Sriracha. I would definitely drive out downtown just get to this. I'll definitely be ordering more than just one next time around. 5/5"}
{"text":"All the hype is not enough, outstanding!  THE FOOD The pulled pork and grilled pork were outstanding, but nothing in life can prepare you for how awesome the pork belly is. We only tried it in the bahn mi, and the bread is near perfection...light and airy and just the right about of crustiness and tooth.  THE ATMOSPHERE Urban, modern, hip. Very tastefully done.  THE SERVICE Super busy, long lines, very efficient."}
{"text":"This grilled pork sandwich, wow. It's like eating a standard plate of Vietnamese food (rice, grilled thin meat, side salad of radish and cucumber) in a baguette and tossing the rice.  The location is clean and small and they have a lot of staff to keep it running quickly. The menu let me know they were out of meatball that day, so I didn't have to ask and be disappointed (wasn't thinking of having it, but it's good to know).  The girl in front of me didn't know what to get and the cashier was very helpful and knowledgeable in advising her to get chicken.  After you pay, you move off to the side, where the setup really lends itself to efficiency. They call your name when your order is ready and confirm what you ordered and the spice content.  The sandwich itself? So tasty. So good. And the thickness of the bread is necessary for all that juicy sauce. Yum.  If my calorie count can handle it, I'll be back every week."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  We had the pork and pork belly banh mi and the flavora are out of this world."}
{"text":"OMGosh, I hope this place never goes away. On my next trip to Toronto, I promise I will eat here every day. My girlfriends and I dined here on our last day in town (or else we would have come back multiple times) and couldn't get over how great their sandwiches are! What makes them so special? Who knows, but they are incredibly delicious! It's easily one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  I ordered the Duck Confit Banh Mi with Kimchee fries. The Banh Mi was inhaled. The Kimchee fries were also delicious, but the banh mi is the star of the show. We still cannot stop talking about it! Hands down, worth a try!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that has not been said already!   Up until Banh Mi Boys, my experience with Vietnamese food was limited to just Pho and Fried Rice.   Upon the recommendation of a fellow Yelper and my sister, I ventured out to the busy Queen West with them.   I am not sure if it was because I listened to the Yelper's recommendation of if all their offerings are just that great!  Their 5 spice pork belly & grilled chicken banh mis are just inexplicably good! :) So glad I got to open my Vietnamese cuisine's horizons.  Price: Really affordable and wallet friendly Ambiance: Not meant for intimate dinners...very casual and extremely busy  Service: Friendly & Fast :) Food: Considering its fast food, its amazingggg!   The experience itself is worth it :)"}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Interesting Asian fusion food to-go.  Layout of restaurant is very poor.  Massive line up at peak.  Layout  made restaurant very crowded with long line up to order & to pick up food."}
{"text":"Bah mi boys offers incredibly flavorful tacos, poutine, bao, and bah mi sandwiches. I have tried pretty much everything on the menu except for the bah mi sandwiches.     Must try #1: five spice pork belly bao! It's a flavor bomb. The bao is soft and warm, and the five spice pork belly is tender & juicy.   Must try #2: kimchi fries. Their Kimchi fries are so flavorful and crispy !   I did find the tacos to be on the drier side compare to the baos. But their price points are reasonable. Most people are satisfy with two tacos / bao + a kimchi poutine to share"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure if I wanted to give 4 or 5 stars, but the insane cheap prices makes it an easy decision to give this 5 stars.  We each got a banh mi sandwich, one pork belly, one kalbi beef.  I preferred the pork belly!  We also shared one order of kimchi fries between the two of us, but it was too much food!  We couldn't finish the fries.  If you're each getting a banh mi, I suggest you share kimchi fries between at least 3 people.  So much food for so little.  And so good!  I'll be back any time I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Line up for anything on the menu is well worth the wait during the lunch hour.  Amazing flavors in the sandwiches, the buns and especially the kimchee fries :)"}
{"text":"Great value for the sandwiches. I've visited on multiple occasions however have yet to try the taco's or kimchi fries. The bao's are quite small but make for a good snack. If you are hungry, go for the Banh Mi's! One is enough. I recommend the duck, the kalbi beef, or the pork! You can adjust the heat level with sliced jalapeno's and siracha sauce! If you are around Queen and Spadina, and looking for a quick bite, this place in my opinion is healthier and cheaper than Burger Priest located across the street."}
{"text":"Food out of this world. Good price, clean and friendly casual staff. Aww the food is soooo good! I'm going back tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"I had BMB today for an office lunch. We used The Hurrier delivery service. The food wasn't as good as when I eat it at the restaurant. But it was still quite tasty and flavourful. I always enjoy eating at BMB. The food is very tasty, unique, fast and healthy. I got the lemongrass tofu banh mi and the panko tofu bao. Both were very tasty!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me this long to review this place. i LOVE banh mi boys -- they have amazing ratings for good reason! You can choose from a variety of bahn mis, tacos, and baos, as well as some delicious side dishes. The portion sizes are very generous and the prices more than reasonable. My personal favourites are definitely the squid taco, kimchi fries, and jicama salad. They have this delicious slaw that goes in the tacos that I would definitely recommend trying. The kimchi fries is a generous serving of fresh, crispy fries topped with pulled pork and kimchi.. It's soo good. The jicama salad is a light and refreshing side dish. Overall, HIGHLY recommend! It's a perfect place for a little snack if you're not that hungry (just get a taco or a bao! bahn mis are a bit bitter), and a bahn mi or two tacos with some sides if you're ravenous."}
{"text":"Service is fast, food is delicious and affordable.    We got the Kimchi fries which was a wonderful fusion of my favourite things! Kimchi and french fries."}
{"text":"Oh so good and generous portions for your money's worth. Flavours are simple yet delicious. Go Bahn Mi Boys!"}
{"text":"I can't imagine fusion viet subs being any better than this! Having grown up on viet subs, I wanted to try their taco instead. As I  was waiting for my order, there were trains of subs passing by on fresh, crispy baguettes with the perfect amount of inside to crust ratio. My heart sank at my own disloyalty...until the taco comes, and omg it's not a soft flour taco, rather a flaky pancake! Sweet, crisp at the bite with a chew finish - perfect for the savoury meats. Duck confit, grilled pork, kalbi beef, five spice pork belly, are all phenomnomnominal. Biggest dilemma now is wanting to re-eat what I loved or trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"The pork belly bahn mi was very flavorful and they packed a lot of carrots and turnip, but I forgot to tell them to hold the coriander which they chopped up so it was hard to pick out.  A bit overpriced for banh mi, but it's a whole lot better than subway!"}
{"text":"Love the kimchi fries ! The prices are great .... the place is small and you dont always get to eat there but you have to get their subs and take it to go...its definitely worth it !!!! No Subway for me anymore :-)"}
{"text":"Short and sweet:  Interesting sandwiches. Kind of a novelty.  Not something I'd want all the time.  On the pricey side.  Perhaps a little overhyped, but worth trying once."}
{"text":"The only thing I really love at Banh Mi Boys is their kimchi fries! I've tried the pulled pork sandwich and it was really just meh.   My sandwich experiences here have always resulted in hard submarine breads with small sandwich fillings. I'm not a fan of the subs and excessive carrots but I should try the Bao variety next time.   The kimchi fries are delicious! The portion is large and I have never seen anywhere else offer this poutine combo. I do wish that there were more cheese curds in the fries.. Maybe because I love cheese..    This place is super busy during weekday lunch hour so be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to spot by Banh Mi Boys on weeknight and I was surprised to see a line-up.  I happily placed my order and waited for my yummy selections, Tofu Panko Crusted Boa Bun and Squid Taco (I was in a non-meat mood that night).  Service took about 5 minutes before I got my order in my hands.  I think I ordered with my eyes as both the boa and taco were bigger in portions that I expected.  The boa bun was delicious even for a non-meat selection; it was sauced well and each bit was a different flavour profile.  The taco was also great, a little more difficult to eat but worth the mess.    I will definitely be back to try the other items on their menu - KIMICHI FRIES!!!  PS. They are opening up a second location in the Yonge & Gerard area!"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious, every time. I always get the baos, those are so delicious. The one at Yonge/Gerrard is also great."}
{"text":"Really excellent takeout for a very affordable price. Good ingredients, fairly well executed sandwiches, surprising diversity of tastes yet very accessible.  Don't expect huge portions if you have a big appetite, may want to order more than one item, it's still cheap. And watch out for too much hot pepper sauce and kimchi if those are not your thing. Braised beef cheek is amazing, perhaps liking it better on steam bun than on sub which is more bready although interesting toppings.  This place is a McFastFood Killer. Good for Bahn Mi Boys setting the bar."}
{"text":"I think about Banh Mi Boys all the time! - Banh Mi grilled pork sandwiches ($4.99) - Banh Mi Bao ($3.49) - Banh Mi Korean Tacos ($3.99)  I also just like saying the word Banh Mi (schoolgirl giggle).  The sandwich was huge! Way bigger than expected. Impressive.   The pork belly bao was savory, flavourful, chewy perfection. I ate one of them and half a sandwich and I was full!  I'll be back for Kimchi fries, that's a promise! =D"}
{"text":"I love the panko steamed bao and the kimchi fries. I usually order through Ritual and it's always been fast, cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"Very good- nothing else I can say. Banh Mi Boys made great sandwiches, of which I had squid, and topped it off with a nice black cherry Canadian soda. This was my lunch, and it left me feeling light and ready for some hot chocolate at Second Cup.  The only downside of this nice place was the long line that stretched outside into the bitter Toronto cold. With a bigger restaurant, Banh Mi Boys will leave people feeling warm after an amazing sandwich and/or Asian burrito."}
{"text":"Quick service even when it's packed. My absolute favorite item on the menu is the five spice pork belly which is always delicious, and very reasonably priced. Will be back to try the kimchi fries and one of the many other tasty looking sandwiches on offer. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great option for lunch or fast dinner. Vietnamese done right. Friendly and fast service + great food = a must experience in T.O"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  Pretty good stuff.   A bit pricier than your regular banh mi you'd buy at a sandwich shop. Could probably get 3-4 regular cold cuts banh mi's for the same price.  But the ingredients are what makes theirs unique.  Had the braised beef banh mi, fried chicken bao and pork belly bao.  Came up to about 15 bucks. The regular person could probably get full on a banh mi and fries.  I've tried the kimchi fries on a previous occasion and they were pretty good. Portion size would be good enough for a meal on its own.  I would recommend the fried chicken bao and kim chi fries."}
{"text":"This was my first Banh mi Boys experience, so I can't compare to the original location.  I can say however that they serve tasty and fresh banh mi!  Got there at 12:05pm, with about 10 people ahead of my friend and I.  We placed our orders quickly and joined the queue to wait for our banh mi.  The line-up was out the door by 12:15pm.  I ordered the 5 spice pork belly, extra spicy.  Pork belly was tender, crisp vegetables and delicious sweet/spicy sauce.  As this location is a close walk from my work and a great price for the quality and size of the banh mi, I intend to come back to sample the bao!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Being predominantly Vietnamese you know what real bahn mi is.  So if you come here then just only go to try something different.  So it's a fast take out spot. You walk in and line up to order from the screen. It's divided by bahn mi, steamed Bao and tacos. Each with pretty much the same toppings and selections. They kinda mix in Chinese, Thai,  and Viet cuisine to the menu. So don't let the name Bahn Mi fool you.  I ordered the 5 Spice Steamed Bao. The bao was delicious. The 5 Spice Pork Belly was amazing. Portion was a good size. I also ordered the Kimchi Fries which was delicious fresh but very soggy after a few mins. It consist of fries, pulled pork, Kimchi and some mayo. Not too bad.  One thing I do like is sadly the choice of beverages. They sell black cherry soda and specialty cokes. I know its not a big deal but it does matter to my meal.  Overall it's ok and for me needs special cravings."}
{"text":"This place is a definite must if you're in the Toronto area!  I love cute little restaurants like this because they are so creative.  I wish they had a location in NYC!  I think they would be a definite hit here for sure.  We tried the five spice pork belly banh mi and it was delicious!  I loved the Korean and Vietnamese fusion.  It wasn't too spicy which was great.  It had just the right amount of kick to it.  I definitely recommend getting this.  We also tried the kalbi beef banh mi and that was delicious as well.  You can't go wrong with kalbi.    The banh mi's were perfect size and I thought they were reasonably priced unlike some Asian fusion sandwich spots we have in NYC.  Yes, I am calling you out Num Pang!  If you like Num Pang, you will definitely like Banh Mi Boys.  If you like Banh Mi Boys, you will like Num Pang, but I warn you, Banh Mi Boys is way better because the sandwiches are regular sizes and you get your moneys worth.    We tried the kimchi fries too and that was delish!  Man, just writing this review is making me hungry.  If you ever find yourself around Queen Street, definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"This is my favourite and my go to Banh Mi place! I don't necessarily come here for their banh mi sandwiches but more for the kalbi beef taco, the fried chicken bao and the kimchi fries! I love all three items and have added a new secret menu favourite to it as well. Today I came by around 6 or 7pm with my brother and his gf. I remembered about the secret menu item that my cousin had told me about and just had to try it. It was the \"Club Bao\" it was basically the fried chicken bao with pork belly for a bit over $6. When I recieved it I thought to myself \"great pick!\" It looked beautiful! The pork belly sure was worth it, especially when you cant between 2 baos but dont have enough stomach space for both cause you just had gelato next door at Kekou. I know what you're thinking... dessert first? Doesn't bother me one bit having sweet before savoury I can have gelato any time of the day in which ever order I wish. The club bao was meaty, salty with pickled veggies, kimchi and mayo to tie it all together. The chicken was juicy and crispy on the outside and the pork belly was flavourful and cooked well and the fat was just melt in your mouth. Next time Ill come on an empty stomach and my bf so we could share the kimchi fries, I love the pulled pork in it! Definitely always recommend this place to family that visit from out of town and never ever disappoints!"}
{"text":"Great bahn mi! Definitely a step up from the usual cold cured meats and worth the step up in price.  I can't decide if I like the grilled pork or the five-spice pork belly better. I think the grilled pork is more flavourful, but I love pork belly when it's done nice and tender the way banh mi boys did it.  Sure you can find a cheaper sandwich, but I felt like I got my money's worth for the amount of meat they put in it, plus the bread was extremely fresh and delicious.  My only complaint was that I two other things I wanted to order, tacos and kalbi bao, were both sold out by the time I got there at 8pm.  But the guys behind the counter were super nice so I couldn't be mad at them...  If this place were neater/cleaner looking (I'm down with bare bones take-out style, but the counters and food prep area looked like they belonged in a back kitchen, not at the front of the shop), it would be a five-star for sure.  Maybe they'll take care of that during their renos."}
{"text":"First time trying the Banh Mi Boys and I love it; reminds me of the Vietnamese sandwiches back in Vancouver. I had the 5 spice pork belly sandwich and the kimchi fries. The sandwich was perfect, fries are like pouring but with pulled pork, kimchi, mayo and green onion. Both were recommended by the girl at the cashier. Great food!"}
{"text":"The Bahn Mi's here are absolute dynamite. The restaurant was a bit small and very busy, but well worth the wait. The sandwiches begin with a crispy fresh baguette topped with your choice of meat and filling. I went with the Kalbi Beef which was a marinated steak with kimchi and traditional bahn mi toppings. Everything about this sandwich from texture, to filling, to size was absolute perfection."}
{"text":"Yeah I am a fan, so far. I tried their Duck Confit Banh Mi today with a side of their fresh cut fries and a bottled water (are they freshly cut? because they were so yummy) which came up to $13. The duck was sooooooooo good. The \"sandwich artist\" guy asked me if I wanted it spicy, but he didn't put enough, but did not ruin the overall experience really. The food was good. But if you come to think of it, it's really pricey. I can just go to the  Nguyen Huong banh mi place in Chinatown or here in Scarborough and pay less than $5 dollars for one, but then again, I had it with Duck Confit....and it was sooooooooo good. I can't wait to go back and try their kim-chi fries and their other stuff."}
{"text":"Dropping by to get some takeout for the hubs - preferable, anyway, to trying to nab one of nine two-person tables here which are currently unfilled but usually packed to the max at this tiny shop.   Today I'm getting the duck leg and five-spice pork belly Vietnamese sub-style sandwiches, though I personally prefer the soft and pillowy baos filled with pork belly.   It's not quite like the original banh mi sandwiches: it doesn't have the French-style pate or sausages in the traditional type, but these are yummy nonetheless.  Plus, at under $10 per 'wich, it sure as heck beats sad frozen burgers from a fast food chain.   I hear a lot of raves about the kimchi fries, but I personally find them passable. I mean, it's kimchi. On fries. Meh.  That being said, it's not like I would say no to my kind, sharing companions...yoink!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I had the Banh Mi Grilled Chicken and my husband had the Banh Mi Duck Confit and they were so good. Very filling at such a great price. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"$6.99 for a banh sub might be double price of the $2.75 Chinatown viet subs up the street but the bread is fluffier and by size they're larger. There's also more choices on fillings but I'm not particularly excited by any of them... The usual hipster pulled pork and such. It's definitely not as spicy as the \"authentic\" banhs . I've had the squid and panko tofu filling. Both were ok but if you're ravenous you'll need to order a side... Kimchi fries sound good. Service is fast though."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys can do no wrong! There really isn't too many places that can compare in flavor, convenience, and awesome value (especially with how expensive restaurants are in downtown Toronto). Took a non-Toronto friend here, and they were impressed by the fusion of flavors.   I can sum up my go-to's in 2 words: KIMCHI FRIES and BANH MI (not surprisingly). I love this combo so much it's basically the standard as soon as I walk in. For a first timer, I'd recommend popular favourites - kalbi beef and 5 spice pork belly - but all of the flavors seem tasty. Banh mi + fries combo is more than sufficient to fill you up also.  If you need a place to grab a quick bite in a casual setting (or even takeout) without your wallet crying, coming here should be a no-brainer."}
{"text":"I LOVE Banh Mi Boys and been making this my go-to \"quick lunch\" spot for years. For around $10 you get a fresh baguette filled with delicious, fresh ingredients that will satisfy your hunger regardless of which sandwich you choose.   My favourite is the fried chicken banh mi which comes with pickled carrots, cilantro, cucumber, mayo and BBQ sauce. It's not the healthiest sandwich in the world but damn it tastes good!  Other favourites are the grilled port (the cheapest at $6.50) and spicy pork belly ($7.50). They also have more adventurous meats on the menu such as squid and duck confit. Vegetarians don't despair - they have tofu too! Most of the items are also available in a bao (steamed bun) or a taco. There really is something for everyone!  I've only tried their fries once or twice and they were pretty good, but let's face it - you're here for their sandwiches!  Pro tip: I usually skip the line and order with Ritual, my sandwich is always on-time and ready to eat while walking along Queen Street."}
{"text":"My new go-to place for cheap eats when in the area. This restaurant is always busy and the staff are friendly. I have tried the five spice pork belly, grilled chicken and grilled pork, all of which are really tasty. I found the kimchi fries a bit of a let down as they were a bit soggy, but I have never tried them anywhere else so don't take my word for it. $20 for two sandwiches and some sweet potato fries is reasonable enough, although you can get the same sandwiches in Chinatown for half the price (but nowhere to sit and the service isn't half as good)."}
{"text":"Great subs take out place near Yonge and Eglinton. The steam buns and veggies taste average but the meats are very well cooked, such as the five spice pork belly."}
{"text":"So yummy!!!!   And affordable!!! :)   Overall very pleased with the place. Heard a lot about it but never had a chance to check it out till today.   They take orders super fast, bit of a line to pick up food but overall pretty quick.   The pork belly steam bun is sooo good! The pork belly is very flavorful and one portion is already quite filling for the price.   If I'm back in the area, I'll definitely come back!!!!   PS. Two of my friends got the kimchi fries and both said it wasn't great.... It didn't look appetizing. It's better to stick with the buns :)"}
{"text":"This place has nice buns.  My first Banh Mi Boys experience! ...yes. my first. Let's move on.  Partner and I split two buns...one was the chicken, the other was the beef. Both were very delicious! I love the addition of cilantro to the buns. It's such a unique taste. Couldn't really decide my favorite - but think it might actually be the beef.  Excited to go back and get kim chi and sweet potato fries!   The Good:  1. Food. The food is delicious and doesn't seem OVERLY unhealthy or sodium filled. 2. Staff. Quick staff and they seem to handle the enormous lines fairly well.  The Bad:  1. Size. This place is small small small! So if you intend to eat there, get one person to stalk a table while the other waits for food. 2. Lines. There are always lines at Banh Mi Boys, so be prepared to wait wait wait!  Recommendation: get 2 or 3 different buns and try a variety. Always a great way to try more things at a new place."}
{"text":"Where there is pork belly, I shall find it!!  While I was researching my trip to Toronto on Yelp, I came across Banh Mi Boys and was overjoyed to see pork belly on the menu. I'm ashamed to say that I have never tried a Banh Mi, but have wanted to for years. Well, I still have not tried a Banh Mi...hehe.  After watching Burger Wars Toronto, we wanted to try Burgers Priest and P&L Burger which are on the same street as Banh Mi Boys, so, having limited valuable stomach space, I had to opt for the much smaller pork belly bao. While small in size, it was big on flavor. Tender delicious pork belly with crisp veggies on top. I ordered mine mild(without siracha) and with mayo. The other was with the siracha. My son who enjoys his spice really liked it and was immediately sorry for making a face when I said we were going to go here before getting burgers. He is now a bao fan. After our burger binge, we went back and got another pork belly bao and a chicken taco. The taco was good, but can't compare to that pork belly in a fluffy pillow of deliciousness!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious but overall experience was so so.   I'm in the service industry and I know it's not fun serving people all day long especially during the afternoon rush. I've been here on 2 separate occasions during this time and have been turned off by the staff's attitudes. It seems like the staff are far more interested in talking to each other and rolling eyes when you ask for them to go light on toppings on the bahn mi sandwich than just saying \"OK no problem\".  First visit, I don't know the circumstances of what they may have had to deal with before I walked in. Second time is a trend and I'm not a fan.  Very unfortunate."}
{"text":"Love it here. Great cheap veggie options with lots of flavour. Love the tofu tacos/banh mi."}
{"text":"The pork Bao was real good!!!  Kimchi fries are a must tooo!!  Wasn't as big of a fan of the beef brisket banh mi - it was a bit tough, and the bread was too chewy for my liking.    Line ups out the door and very little seating space - which is fine w me because I usually order take out here for lunch.  Would def recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is like a food truck in a store (that's a compliment). They serve gourmet food truck style food that's great. I always loved this type of food. I had the braised beef cheak on a steamed bun, That was perfect! I also had a grilled chicken taco. It was also great, the chicken was a tad bit on the dry side, but nothing to get upset about. Overall great place, that I will be eating at a lot. Finally the prices aren't too bad. Usually a place with this concept would overcharge for their \"works of art\", but not here."}
{"text":"First impression was \"there's nowhere to sit\". Seats are hard to come by since there are only a handful of tables and chairs. They do have a standing bar in the right wall which is convenient if you're on the run or just grabbing a quick bite by yourself.   PORK BELLY BUN -- The pork belly was so good! I can appreciate me a really good, nice piece of pork belly & fat - and oh my. It wasn't dry at all and wasn't too fatty. The bun wasn't too doughy either which I liked. It had a nice chewy texture rather than being too soft. In my opinion could have been a little bit sweeter, but good no less.   PORK BANH MI -- I don't know if they put crack in the mayo, but it is so good. The marinated meat had a good flavor on it's own. With the mayo...forget about it. Greatness. The pickled veggies are usually my favorite part of Vietnamese sandwiches and the cilantro. I'm glad they weren't skimpy with it. Nice thin layers/cuts of cucumber were great. I prefer it to those thick cuts normally serviced in banh mi. I think the bread is what makes or breaks the banh mi. The baguette was nice and soft. Little bit of crisp, but not to the point you're shaving off the roof of your mouth. Thumbs up.   Overall enjoyable. I was from out of town and my friend always wanted to try this place so we thought we would give it a go. It was really reasonably priced. I thought it was pretty interesting their fusion type approach with korean and other Asian flavors. Recommend giving it a try when you're looking for something easy and quick."}
{"text":"I've never gotten a thing here that I don't love.   They have an assortment of baos, banh no sandwiches, fries and even salad. Everything here is fresh and delicious.   The service here is great, everyone is friendly and efficient and they get the job done.   Great take out for lunch dinner any time! :)"}
{"text":"This review is specifically for their kimchi fries, which were SO FREAKING GOOD! They had so much flavor and the toppings were perfect. I can't wait to go back and have the banh mi with kimchi fries. It's a small shop, but there is seating."}
{"text":"Love there kimchi fries. I've been here twice in this month. Every dish is so delicious and not expensive at all. Definitely will come back soon. And the background music is very cool too."}
{"text":"Not as great as I hoped but still pretty good.  The Kalbi banh mi was okay (I have a high standard for korean/korean-fusion food), papaya salad was solid, but the Kimchi fries are amazing!  Perhaps the baos or tacos may be more impressive but I'll at least give it a try solely to get more kimchi fries!"}
{"text":"Gourmet Banh Mi!  About time!  It is funny how the Spadina Banh Mi places seem to always raise their prices at the same time.  I figured it was about time someone came in and said \"ok, I'm going to charge a little more but the sandwich is going to be bomb\".  Banh Mi Boys did just that.  I had the 5-spice pork belly and tried the beef dahbi taco and both were perfect.  Great flavor, everything was high quality and the price was reasonable ($11 for both dishes, tax-in).  I will be back! Way better than what you get for $3 on Spadina.  YUM!"}
{"text":"It's pretty decent as far as banh mi goes. I wish the bread had more of a crunch. Other than that, they have a pretty big sandwich for the cheap price."}
{"text":"I dropped by here one day after work with my best friend and it was my first time. I actually know one of the guys that work there!  I ordered the kimchi french fries and I have to say that it did not disappoint! It was amazing. It also had some shredded pork.  I like my food fairly spicy so he also add sriracha sauce. The whole thing was about $6-7  Definitely going here again! It gets very busy so look out for the lineup!"}
{"text":"Insane insane, hard to describe what just happened. Super juicy and slightly charred Pork belly bah mi, loaded with cilantro and fresh chopped veg, habaneros and spicy mayo. A clear 10/10. Also friendly service and patience to explain the menu deeply.  Take my money now. Must walk the menu end to end. We also tried the steamed bun with fried tofu, also ridiculous. Go now. Go!   Why are you still here?"}
{"text":"The Club Bao on the Secret Menu is the tastiest, juiciest, delight ! Double decked with fried chicken and pork belly it really is the best of both worlds, complementing each other with two tasty but different flavors.   Depending on how hungry you are get the Bao vs. Bahn Mi as the Bao is about half the size for 3/4 of the price.   This place is very busy during the lunch rush and for good reason, so be prepared to wait ~30 min. They have Ritual so you can order ahead and wait in your office and arrive when it's ready which is very handy !"}
{"text":"This was my lunch spot when I worked at Just Eat!  Never had a bad experience here. Great food, service and prices! I've had the Fried Chicken Steamed Bao, Braised Beef Banh Mi, and the Squid Tacos (Not all in one sitting mind you). They were all amazing! I regret not trying the Kimchi Fries but one day. If you are going for the steamed Bao's make sure you get two as one will not be enough. Or you can always pair it with a fries or something.   All in all, I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. I give it two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is a great place to drop by for a quick lunch. I went there with my friends because of the great reviews and it did not disappoint! I got the Kalbi sandwich and the kimchi fries. The were both packed with flavour. This place does a great job putting a new twist on traditional food.  The only thing I would have to complain about is the lack of seating. They were only a few tables and me and my friends were squished to one table. Other than that, you can't go wrong with Bahn Mi Boys. They do an amazing with the Asian fusion. I recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm usually very skeptical of these kinds of fusion places, but I thought we should give it a shot.  If you're looking for traditional banh mi, turn around and go up Spadina and pay half the price for it.   But if you've come here, you gotta be a bit more adventurous. I loved my squid banh mi! I was afraid it was gonna be a bit chewy, but there was no problem there. Feeling a bit indulgent we also ordered the kimchi tofu fries... it was a meal of its own! But no regrets here!"}
{"text":"I would have loved to give this place four stars but my experience today was not so great.  I went in to order kimchi fries for take out and mentioned to the girl who takes the order that last time the fries were burnt and could she check it before they pack today. She says nothing about my feedback and continues to bill me, doesn't even acknowledge it with a 'sorry about that' or 'I'll check that for you this time' or even a nod!  She bills me and I ask her, 'so could you check they aren't burnt this time before you pack it?' and she asked me if i want it undercooked?! No I don't want it undercooked I want it cooked the way fries are supposed to be, just not burnt. To which her only response is that I should call the next time if its burnt (and rolls her eyes..) I mean what good is that going to do, won't it be easier to check before you pack?  I know its a small place and I shouldn't be expecting red carpet treatment but I do pay for my food and don't get it for free so please spare me the eye rolling and I-don't-care-if-you-buy-or-not attitude. Unfortunately I had already paid by then but I will not be going again. I would rather take my money to where people are happy to get it.  PS: I made a mistake when I posted the review first. It ended up being on the Queen Street store address."}
{"text":"Visited them last week for the first time.  I had a Grilled Chicken Banh Mi and the wife had a Lemongrass Tofu Banh Mi, and we both loved our sandwiches. The veggies were very fresh and crisp. The chicken was very flavorful, so were their dressings.  The location is very convenient. Prices are very reasonable. Portions size is good.  Great taste. Amazing value for money."}
{"text":"Loved my first taco hard to choose on first visit I went with as best spicy I could feel and enjoy Want to try the pork belly next visit"}
{"text":"We were here for an early dinner so it wasn't yet packed. Service was quick and we got a table, which was relatively clean. I had the fried chicken bao ($4) and the braised beef bao ($3.50) and they were really good. The crunch and sweetness of the veggies work really well against the savoury meat. However, I've been to both locations and I distinctly remember the fried chicken bao having thicker and juicier chicken at the queen west location. I'll have to go again to see if that's a one off or if I'm better off getting my bao on Queen St."}
{"text":"Definitely some awesome banh mi right here.  The duck confit is my favorite and I like their baos too.  Kimchi fries are so good and come in a great size.  If duck isn't your thing then check out the pork belly.  Every time I come here I need to get two things because I want my regular and I want to try something new.  Ok, I'm going there for lunch.  You happy, Yelp?  You asked me if I've been here and now I have to walk from King and York alllllllll the way back cause now I'm hungry.  *smh*...  Btw, check out their drink fridge cause they have a selection of unique Cokes i.e. Cherry and Vanilla.  Haven't had those in years."}
{"text":"This place is simply delicious. I'm from Jordan and I've had plenty of Vietnamese food in the US and in Asia before but this place has THE BEST BAOS I've ever had. The fried chicken bao is really good and their hot sauce options are awesome. I spent only 5 days in Toronto and have eaten there 3 out of those 5. It's a must-visit restaurant if you're a tourist"}
{"text":"Bahn Mi reinvented!  Bahn Mi Boys is a great spot for cheap, yet filling, eats in the downtown core.  They do Bao, Bahn Mi, Kimchi ries and tacos.  The Bahn Mi is fresh and delicious, a generous helping of meat is topped off with fresh crunchy picked carrots and radish with fresh cilantro.  Though I do miss the mayo and pate that authentic Bahn Mi has I am sure this version is much healthier. For $5.50-8 the sandwich makes for a great lunch.  The bao is an exceptional value.  Unlike many other places that offer bite sized bao, Bahn Mi Boys offer up a heafty bao with your choice of meat (or tofu). For around $3.50 to $4 you can sample quite a few varieties or just have one or two as a inexpensive snack.  I also tried the Kimchi Fries, I had them in the past on the Yonge St. location and totally fell in love with the taste of the sour pickely kimchi and the creamy mayo and spicy siracha sauce. However, this location seemed lacking, not sure if it was the Kimchi that lacked Korean chili flavour or something else but it just wasn't as delicious as I remembered. But it was still tasty nonetheless.  Highly recomend trying for a quick, cheap bite if you're hangry and in the area!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars!  Cheap good quality food, great value and you get pretty large portions for the price.  Need I really say more?  Everything on the menu is good but my personal favourites are the pulled pork bao, pork belly bao and kimchi fries. They usually make everything fresh and hot to order.  I also love the carrots and fresh cilantro they add to every dish.    You can't go wrong at Bahn Mi Boys!  Go. Eat. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Bread.  I love bread.  It was nice and chewy.  I got the Kalbi bahnmi. Only thing was the meat was lacking good flavor.  Again. I think the Toronto food scene is very lacking."}
{"text":"I had the pork belly sandwich with sweet potato fries, and it was very tasty! I'm looking forward to trying the different options."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and it never disappoints. This place is often packed but the line moves really quick. The grilled pork banh mi is solid as are the kimchi fries. This is the place to go if you want a cheap and tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after reading it was the best place in Toronto to get a sandwich... I guess my expectations were a little too high since i've ate out almost everywhere in Tdot and im really particular with my sandwiches.   I ordered the Five Spice pork belly Banh mi and kimchi fries.   After eating almost half the sandwich I felt like i was just forcing the rest into my mouth because I didnt want to waste the 6 bucks I paid for it. It's not horrible but it gave me the same satisfaction as the $1.50 banh mi I can pick up at chinatown. Nothing different about it.   the best thing about the kimchi fries is the name \"kimchi fries\". Its pretty much another s'okay dish but definately not worth the cash. It tasted like New york fires with kim chi on it.  Dont get me wrong, I dont mind paying a premium for great food but this place did not live up to the hype in my opinion.   There was however a cute cashier chick and thats the only reason im giving this rating 2 stars."}
{"text":"Downtown? Looking for a quick bite? This place will do the trick. Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon, there was no line and we were able to order right away. We both ordered the Braised beef sandwich, and an order of fries and one coke. Came to just under 20.00 for the both of us. Just a tip, if paying with USD, they take it at par... After we ordered we sat down at one of the few tables in the place. The place is small and has about 7 tables. The fries were great and plentiful. The sandwiches were alight. The beef was very tasty but there was more bread and veggies then anything else. They veggies were crisp and flavorful, I just felt the sandwich was lacking meat. But for the cost of the sandwich, this place is not bad for a quick bite. Not a place I would frequent but, if I wanted something quick and cheap and I was close, I'd stop in."}
{"text":"Never fails to be delicious. My go to pregnancy craving. My go to regular life craving. Banh mi boys forever!"}
{"text":"Good food, decent price. The kimchi fried are really good. I don't eat pork so i got the tofu version. I'm also not a big fan of mayo and the fries were great without that too. Bread is soft and warm and they make the sandwiches to order so you have to wait a bit. The staff was okay-- not friendly but not bad. Seating is pretty limited. They also have a jicama papaya salad, sweet potato fries, buns, and tacos. Worth trying and would probably return if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great service, and the pork belly banh mi that I ordered was good, but I'm giving it 3 stars because...my name is Sue and I'm a banh mi purist. Coming from the Sacramento area and having eaten in the San Jose sandwich shops, I couldn't help but miss my \"special combo\" banh mi, the one with the pate and Vietnamese cold cuts covered with the perfect ratio of sweet pickled veggies and fresh cilantro, all on a beautiful crunchy French baguette.  Would I recommend this to a friend? If they were looking for interesting fusion flavors, then yes."}
{"text":"Been here another two times. Regardless of the lineups or the time of day, service is always friendly and helpful. Food is fantastic, especially for the price.  Can't go wrong with anything: To date have tried 5 Spice Pork Bun Tacos: Pulled Pork, Beef Bao: Fried Chicken   Everything is good to very good."}
{"text":"Great place to pick up a snack in-between meals. We got two pork banh mi and a kimchi fries. Their banh mi's are overpriced compared to those in Chinatown but their kimchi fries were great! I have yet to try their bao's."}
{"text":"I would give 6 stars if I could. Hands down the best cheapest lunch in town!! All locations are excellent."}
{"text":"Bahn Mi and I have been friends since there was a $2 fake meat bahn mi available from one of the Chinatown posts.  As a vegetarian, I've had a hard time finding anything meal-worthy since that one closed.  Since then, I occasionally stop by and eat a dried out bun with fried tofu and whatever sauces they put it on it. Even though I'm super close to BMB, I didn't get to try it until they were open for real with a full menu of options, several of which I can safely eat.  Now, I could seriously ear here every day. The Panko-crusted tofu Bao is off the charts good. It combines crunchy tofu with soft rice-flour bread, spicy sauce and veggies. Cilantro is one of my favorite foods. The bahn mi with tofu is also a great, full meal on it self. The tofu is softer and the crunchy vegetables on top are a perfect combo.  Finally, the other veggie option is the green papaya salad. Also, a perfect complement of spicy and sweet.  Service has been great so far, as well. The guys and ladies behind the counter want to make the best food they can, just for you."}
{"text":"The foods great except felt ripped off ordering the 5 spice pork banhmi when it came with hardly any meat in it. Might as well have gone for the steamed bao.  The staff aren't smart enough to help a disgruntled customer either, when we handed the dish back they just stared back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to go! (Especially on a budget.)  I usually get the grilled chicken/pork banh mi which is delicious. I highly recommend the braised beef banh mi as well. Kimchi fries are also great. It's very affordable and even though it's quite busy I never have trouble finding a seat."}
{"text":"I love going there. So cheap and so tasty! I always take the buns, all of them are good so you can pick any and you'll be satisfied. The salad is also good. It's so much better than the American fast food around."}
{"text":"Two words. Yummy and cheap!!  Fast service. Great fusion of sandwiches. Come here all the time"}
{"text":"Only been here once and I'm already dying to come back.. They serve fresh viet food that leaves you satisfied and longing to want more. In love with the aroma that the food brings out and how convenient it is to quickly grab it for lunch or a quick snack.  They don't have much seating so I wouldn't recommend eating there because it tends to be quite busy."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place and decided to give it a try. Was okay but definitely overrated. I had the duck confit sandwich and the bread was disappointing. Not crispy at all, soft througout (but maybe that's how you like it). the duck tasted okay but nothing amazing and the pickled vegetables were a tad on the bland side. Overpriced for what it was at $7.50 a sandwich. a traditional banh mi sandwich would trump this any day."}
{"text":"I will start this review off by saying I am not really a bahn mi  connoisseur...my husband really likes them so I was willing to give this place a go.  He got the five spice pork and I got the chicken and we both really liked them.  He said that theirs weren't as traditional as hes had in some hole in the wall type places, but quality was there nonetheless."}
{"text":"I grab a squid Bahn Mi once a week, it's awesome.   Tofu fries sound tempting, but aren't my thing. Limp tofu = gross. Deep fry that s***."}
{"text":"On our last day in Toronto we decided to come here for quick lunch before driving back to the U.S.  The place is small with limited seating. Consider taking your lunch to go and eat somewhere at a park. We were lucky to get a seat for all of us. Service was quick. We bought mahi-mahi $7.99 banh mi, braised beef banh mi. Llittle kids had the squid taco, fried chicken bao (no complaints) also kimchi fries.  All for $31. The banh mi is good for 2 if you are a small eater. They will ask you the level of spiciness - mild/none, medium (sriracha) & hot (jalapeños). I think my husband liked everything he had especially the kimchi fries.  Toilet in the basement."}
{"text":"Live broadcast live broadcast!  First time anyone has possibly ever yelped live but i am here and on my jack jones so my one free hand needed to be productive.  Small joint, easily missed if you were not looking for it specifically.  Could do with more seating so high tables and chairs would be more efficient.  Ordered the Duck Confit $7.49 and although the place is busy I had it within 5 minutes.   First bite - caught the vege side of the sandwich, tangy and sweet with that familiar viet flavour  Second bite - oh yeah duck in a sweet and slightly spicy (because i asked for it that way) type sauce, total yumminess  Third bite - holly molly baguette sex in my mouth! The combination of the previous two bites meant I was no longer able to comprehend a life without banh mi boys at least once a week.   It was not filling but it has given me enough reason to come back here after costume hunting and on the way home and give the kalbi beef a try."}
{"text":"Where to begin? I first walked into the doors of Banh Mi Boys a little over a week ago, and I've been back three times since. I literally cannot get enough!  Located just a stones throw west from Queen West and Spadina this little Korean style sandwich shop helped me to rediscover what it meant to achieve a Food-boner! inappropriate? Go there for lunch and you tell me  Don't be discouraged by the lunch line, the staff is working at Mach-3 and the turn around is really quick. And with the combination of the menu board and the smell of different orders cooking, the line up is a blessing in disguise as you watch order after order being turned out.   What I've had thus far...  - Duck Confit sandwich - I wanted to try something different and I went for it with this sandwich. Tasty, filling, affordable (10/10). If you like heat I recommend adding the red chilis and the hot sauce. Not a killer heat but one that makes the taste buds sing  (Stops...reflects...salivates). Ok moving on...  - Kalbi Beef Taco - Cooked perfectly tender, not chewy at all. Sauce is BAWSE!! Their soft tortillas may look small but they can pack a whole lot of yumm into those little things. And at $3.99 a piece, your silly to not by 2 or 3  - Pulled Pork Taco - Unreal smoky flavor, I dont know where they have put a meat smoker in that little place but I'm happy to assume that the flavor on that pulled pork is the product of some sort of immaculate smoke-ception. Tortilla and sauce with all the fixings (same as above) make for a fab-tastic meal  Whats next..  My next trip will see me attempting the take down the Kim chi fries (review to come)."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the hype with this place. I tried every type of thing off their menu. A bao bun, a taco, the kimchi fries, and the chicken Banh Mi. I found the food to be overly greasy and lacking flavor. Maybe I ordered totally wrong? But I didn't finish anything I got and with the fries I only had 1 bite, they were soggy. If I had to pick something I would say the taco was the best and had the most flavor. I can't say I'll be back to this place."}
{"text":"If only I could be the brand ambassador for Banh Mi Boys.............  This place is beyond, beyond, beyond amazing! Its a small shop, nothing fancy, but the food is oh-my-gosh.  I have had the kimchi fries, chicken bao, pork and grilled chicken sandwiches, and pork belly bao. ALL have surpassed my expectations. All are priced very reasonably which make it a go-to spot for many of Ryerson students.  If I could eat here everyday without comproming my waist, trust me I would! Oh, and they sell Vanilla Coke! That's a bonus in my books."}
{"text":"The Kimchi fries were really good. It's located in a nice spot--lots of local musicians come out to play. I had the pleasure of watching a great band rock out right from my spot inside Banh Mi Boys. Their sandwiches aren't actually my favourite since they just taste so different from traditional banh mis, but maybe that's a good thing. An enjoyable spot--worth a try at least once."}
{"text":"Been to Banh Mi Boys plenty of times at their original location, so I was pleased to find that this new place serves food just as good.  The infamous Kim Chi fries are indeed worldly, I recommend to share this item as it is a tad large and heavy to eat it alone.  Personally, I always get the Baos (white sweet bun) over the sandwiches.  The best tasting are the Five-Spiced Pork Belly Baos and the Beef Baos.  The combination of the spices and the soft texture of the bun is heavenly!    I should mention that the mild almost had no heat, so I would ask for the hot as it's not too bad.  This location is bigger than than the original location on Queen,  it has about double the seating capacity, although you'll still have wait around for table to open up."}
{"text":"For what it is its quite perfect.  Cheap food, great for lunch. Perfect price points, food is always made perfectly.   My go-to food options are always the fried chicken bao, and the five spice pork belly. I prefer the fried chicken bao more and at around 4 dollars you can't really beat it."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Banh Mi Boys and it was awesome! Based on the Kimchi Fries and the Secret Menu Club Bao (Pork Belly and Fried Chicken), it gets a 5 star from me. The girl at the register was very efficient, but then it was a decent wait once I ordered my food. Luckily, in this time a table opened up so me and my sister sat down to kill some time and secure a spot to eat. I know I should try other things on their menu, but I was so impressed with my meal that I don't know if I want to risk it. Also they will ask you how spicy you want your sandwich. I went with medium which just means Sriracha sauce, hot adds jalapenos and I believe extra hot was habaneros. Overall, I can definitely see why they are so popular and keep expanding. They offer quality sandwiches with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Not a fan of their buns, but the rest is great, especially the spicy Kim chi fries!"}
{"text":"Really disappointing the last two times.   Banh mi sandwiches are fine, but it is IMPOSSIBLE to get the boys to make them spicy.    Extra hot (habaneros) is the mildest sandwich that I have ever eaten.  They don't get it.   It makes me sad."}
{"text":"Very good stuff.  I had the grilled pork banh mi and the kimchi fries.  The pulled pork on the fries were tender with a nice bbq taste to it.  Kimchi was good.  Good enough portion that filled me up.  I would definitely go back again for the food.  Not enough tables or chairs so you either take it out or stand inside during the winter."}
{"text":"I find this location a little bit bigger and less cramp than their Spadina and Queen location.  The food at both places are equally tasty.  Usually its quite difficult to get a seat but we didn't have a problem when we went because of the parade happening outside. The Kimchi fries was a tasty delight as usual with kimchi, green onions and pull pork over fries.  The pork belly in the bahn mi was nice and tender and went great with the bun.  I wished the grill chicken in the bahn mi were in bigger whole pieces rather than in the small chunks. However the taste of the grill chicken was still okay.  I'll come back to this location again if I'm close by.  It's a nice quick eat!"}
{"text":"Top notch stuff coming out of this small and usually very busy spot off Spadina/Queen. This was one of my favorite places to grab a quick lunch since the portions were just right.  I haven't tried the sandwiches, but I absolutely love the bao/steamed bun. The fried chicken is a without-fail choice for anyone who is going for the first time. The sandwiches all come with a bit of picked veggie goodness. I like extra cilantro on mine for that peppery kick.  I'd recommend for lunch to get a sandwich/bun or two tacos (they are a bit smaller) and a side order of kimichi fries or the jicama salad. I'd say unless you have a big appetite 1 sandwich, 1 (maybe 2) buns and 2 tacos is more then enough. The full order of fries is ridic plenty."}
{"text":"(Afrika Bambaataa's \"Planet Rock\" begins to play)  \"Party people...Party people...Can y'all get funky?\"  (I take a heaping forkful of Kimchi Fries)  \"Soul Sonic Force, can y'll get funky?\"  (I stand up, clear space.)  \"The Zulu Nation, can y'll get funky?\"  (Take a bite of Kalbi Banh Mi)  \"Yaaaaaa...Just hit me.\"  [Uprock into Air Flare into Windmill...Halo, Halo, Headspin...Freeze.]  I open my eyes.  As a kid, I always dreamed of being a REAL breakdancer. A breaker. A b-boy. I wanted to go by the name Chris \"Crazy Legs\" L. I practiced every day in my driveway on a sheet of linoleum and showcased my moves at school dances. Although I was never able to do a real \"power move,\" my aspiring b-boy years were one of the highlights of my nightmare of an adolescence. So, when Planet Rock came on yesterday at BMB, I was immediately transported to a different time and place, only this time, I had a pile of delicious Viet-Mexican fusion food in front of me.  Since my initial visit last winter, Banh Mi Boys has become one of my must-gos whenever I come to Toronto. I've been to many of Toronto's great restaurants, but this is the only one I would be truly sad about not visiting while here.  Everyone knows that the food here is awesome. The kimchi fries, kalbi everything, pork belly buns...all amazing. The drinks are diverse. The seating is endearingly limited.   But it's the atmosphere that makes this place special. Sitting here eating this food, listening to this music with my hot Asian fiancée represents the life is always dreamed of as a child.   Thats why I will always come back for more."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this place despite the high yelp ratings.  I tried the Grilled Chicken Bahn Mi and Steamed Bao.  Both were just ok as I've had much better elsewhere.  The bread should really make a Vietnamese Sandwich but the bun it did have that high quality French roll-type flavor.  The toppings were also not right both in proportion and quality.  There was just something about this sandwich that just didn't come together nicely. The Steamed Boa was relatively better but still in ok-land, I honestly don't remember enough of it to comment with more detail.   Now if I need a grease fix, I would come back to this place to try the Kimchi Fries that everyone is raving about but not for the Bahn Mi because you can find better.  I think this place is popular because it's reasonably priced for the amount of food you get so it's deserves a 3 on this basis.  It could serve a cheap, quick fix type of spot at best."}
{"text":"Everytime i come here to get a cheap and quick meal that satisfies my cravings. the price is so good for what you get when you compare it to other place that sells a similar style of food such as Lucky Red and Mean Bao. i usually get the five spice pork belly steamed bao and of course my beloved vanilla coke!!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich.  Fast service.  Good pricing.   Wish the meat in the sandwich was more spread out and not smushed into the corner of the bun."}
{"text":"Finally one on the innumerable Top 10 lists that's actually worth the hype. Very reasonable prices and you can tell the ingredients are definitely a notch above in quality from the more traditional banh mi shops north on Spadina. The baos are delicious - I've tried the pork belly, beef cheek and fried chicken and all are awesome (maybe the last one wins by a hair). I like the concept of the duck confit baguette but found it too heavy on the sauce without the delicious crunch of a well-executed confit. The poutine was a bit heavy, soggy and salty but it could be because I had it for takeout. Bit heavy on the cilantro on all the sandwiches but hey you can always take it off or ask to go light. Overall very tasty."}
{"text":"I dont know why this place has such high yelp rating..we ordered duck confit sandwich and pork sandwich..the sandwiches are way salty..and meat are so hard..the meats doesn't taste fresh at all...I could not even finish half the sandwich because it was just so salty and the flavor are not good....the sandwich esp for the duck confit is over-priced..  I have tried many vietnamese sandwich in the past, the sandwich are not authentic vietnamese sandwich ..they just taste aweful!..i would not come back again"}
{"text":"Whoa. So so good.   I had two tacos, tofu and pulled pork. The were amazing. Lots of cilantro, well seasoned fillings, holy moly.   There was quite a line when we got there but it moved quickly and was well worth the wait.   Great prices, excellent food. Need to head back to try some of the other tasty looking menu items!"}
{"text":"A good mix of fusion and authenticity. The fusion comes from the Korean kalbi and duck confit in a bahn mi form as well as the menu item that turned this place famous, the kimchi fries. The authenticity comes from the five spiced pork belly, which tastes just like braised pork my mom would make at home. If you're in Toronto, this is a must-try. Even if you're not into novelty fusion foods, you'll still enjoy it a lot. Whenever I'm bringing a friend here for their first time, I ALWAYS get the kimchi fries because I think that's the only way to get the full experience at Banh Mi Boys. At one point I was eating kimchi fries so often that I had to stop bringing people here haha. Not gonna lie though it was kind of worth it tho ;)"}
{"text":"Oh my god, so good. So very worth every great review that they have.  I got the Kalbi bahn mi and it was delicious. Huge portion with lots of meat inside. The meat was flavourful and juicy. I do wish that the baguette crust was a lil bit crispier, but overall the break was also nice and fluffy and yummy.   I also got the Tofu Fries, which were french fries covered in tofu, kimchi, mayo, and other good stuff. They were delicious! The portion is massive though, so I would recommend splitting it between people or ordering just the fries.  The storefront isn't too large, but there is some seating inside. If it's busy, you might have some difficulty grabbing a spot. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I finally remembered to drop by this place for the great banh mis I keep hearing about. Ding ding ding everyone who advised me to go deserve a gold star 'cause this place is seriously serving up good food!  The kalbi beef I ordered was so tender, juicy, and flavourful. They don't skimp on the meat at all. The toasted bun was crunchy outside and moist inside. The chopped veggies were cool and perfectly marinated. Biting into this thing was like getting a mouthgasm. I was taken through a journey of bursts of balanced flavour and texture (...am I still writing a review for a banh mi shop?!).   OMG can I go back and grab another one right now?! My mouth is seriously salivating too much."}
{"text":"Awesome, love this place. Best fusion food. Get the beef taco!!   Really like how they recycle so neatly."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the downtown locations of the Banh Mi Boys franchise. I think this uptown  location is the best out of all of them.   The food is what you can expect from. You can never go wrong with a pork banh mi sandwich and of course top it off with the kimchi fries.   The modern interior is what gives this location a slight edge over it's downtown locations. Its spacious, tables have a black finish so it makes it a lot sleeker and cleaner, lots of tables (good for bigger parties), and great ceiling art.   Very pleased that they opened this location at Yonge and Eglinton."}
{"text":"This is my go to place to eat banh mi and steamed bao.  Can't go wrong with a grilled pork banh mi with a 5 spice pork belly steamed bao. Yum! You can also choose your spicy level which I always go with mild at the cash register. You can also omit any topping that you do not like which is great.  From time to time, it takes a while for them to make it (really depends if they are busy or not). At least we know that everything is prepared fresh. Seating is quite limited as it gets filled up pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Had lunch (take-out) here a few weeks ago and heard the food was really good so we just had to try a few of their menu items. Lineup was long but the service was quick.  Food (4.5/5) - Kalbi beef bahn mi - Pulled pork bahn mi - Pork belly steamed bao - Beef cheek steamed bao - Fried chicken steamed bao - Pulled pork steamed bao - Kimchi Fries Service (4.5/5) Price (5/5) Ambiance (3/5)  I've since gone back a second time and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time Saturday night and I'm a big fan! I think the price is very reasonable for the amount of food you get. I had a 5 spice pork belly steamed bao and shared a box of kimchi fries with a friend. The kimchi fries were a great shareable snack food and the steamed bao was pretty good too. I can see myself coming back here for a quick and filling lunch."}
{"text":"The first time I came here the line up was out the door, but thank god I decided to wait it out because I discovered my new favourite cheap eat in Toronto. By now, I think I have tried almost everything on the menu (except the salads) from the melt-in-your-mouth pork belly bao, incredibly filling kimchi fries with pulled pork (fab for sharing), and delectable kalbi beef banh mi - all for a little more than $5.   As a long time lover of Vietnamese submarines, this place takes the cake. These are not your typical Chinatown subs -  I simply love the fusion of different Asian flavours (I mean, they love their kimchi here, but who doesn't?!) and despite the small space and long waits, the atmosphere is upbeat and the staff are efficient and friendly.   Hmm... maybe I'll go here for lunch today (again!)"}
{"text":"L'institution pour les sandwichs viet à Toronto. Allez y et commandez !  Best place to go for vietnamese sandwiches in Toronto. Go there and order!"}
{"text":"Bahn mi boys never disappoints. My favorite are the pulled pork bahn mi, crispy chicken bao, kalbi taco, and the kimchi fries. The calamari was alright but subpar compared to the rest  Get the fried chicken bao with pork belly, it's AMAZING (and caloric, but you gotta try it once).  HOWEVER, they're constantly busy all day, and the line is insane during lunch hours. Not even Ritual helps. And you probably won't find seating. It calms down a bit towards the end of the day."}
{"text":"Solid sandwiches for a great price. They really hit the spot. The bread to rest of ingredients ratio was too heavy on the bread side though...I think the sandwiches would be better off with less bread going on and charge $0.5 less."}
{"text":"Awesome Asian Fusion Fast Food place! Very good service and of course very good food there  Even though there is a small amount of food on the menu, the taste and the amount given is amazing!   Best of all! It's in Toronto! I love going there and experiencing all of food in he city and every corner you go to there is always something different.   But what I recommend is the pork belly baos. First time I ever had pork belly there and at first when I thought of pork belly, I thought of the food being really fatty, so I tend to avoid pork even though it is pretty awesome. When I first had the five spice pork belly Bao, it was amazing! It wasn't fatty at all and it was like pulled pork when you bite into it. Very savoury and I can identify all the items inside the Bao, from the sauce to the pickled daikon and carrots. It's phenomenal!  Second favourite is the Banh Mi. I first asked for the pulled pork Bao at the beginning but there was a communication error that happened between the clerk and I but it wasn't a bad move! The Pulled pork Banh Mi was equally amazing just like the Bao but bigger and with a baguette! (I love Baguettes!) After getting my sandwich, I went out and ate upstairs in the barbershop above to watch some Fresh Prince of Belair lol. But the food was amazing never the less and I would continue to go there every time I'm in Toronto"}
{"text":"really glad to see something like this open up, combines the \"ghetto\" bahn mi like nguyen with the attention of a real restaurant ..  meal: kimchi fries, pork bahn mi, pork belly cha su, five spice bahm ni. rib bahn mi (I wasn't alone so hence all the sandwiches) medium spice.  bottom line: get the kimchi fries here, and run up the street to nguyen or the other shop for a sandwich because while the fries are unique, the sandwiches are not worth the price.  taste: bahm ni: rating is 2 this was alright but in all honestly (and maybe its because the two times that I got my order were just not representative) the bahn mi does not portray the usual qualities of the other bahn mi shops, they bbq pork is not a flavourful, the cilantro and carrot are lacking, the bun is definitely not as crispy and fresh and was stale.  for kimchi fries, the rating is 4 as the taste is definitely unique in terms of both contents (who knew to mix kimchi and fries together) and texture : found the crispy/soft texture unique, the toppings are fresh.   portion: rating is 2 hands down the other places are better in terms of the amount of veggies and, cilantro, and carrots you get, maybe its just me (i've only been here twice), but the portion sizes of the sandwiches, particularly the stuff inside them, is not as good. The bun is the same I think?  kimchi fries are decent in terms of portion, so its a 3.     price: the rating here is 2. Compared to the regular bahm mi, of course this place is pricier at 5-6$ a sandwich, but even when considering the \"added\" value in terms of their attention to food and the new restaurant decor, I find this too high.  service: 4: I though service was quite good.  so get the fries and run!"}
{"text":"Great place if you are in the mood for a quick bite and craving a great bahi mi sandwich. My husband and I have been here at least three times and absolutely love this place. The beef bulgogi is my favorite bahi mi, the bread is always fresh baked, and the veggies are tasty. The only downside is getting a table since the space is pretty tight."}
{"text":"The Kimchi Fries and the sandwiches makes this place a must try, even if the seating accommodations don't meet the large, loyal growing fanbase."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Quite possible the best bang for your buck in Toronto in terms of quality, flavour, and portions.  Why: It's a staple and ultimate go-to when you want an affordable meal that feels like a steal  Who: Myself  What: Five Spice Pork Belly Banh Mi + Fried Chicken Steamed Bao  The Story: Bao: Moist, flavourful, and the fried chicken was light on the fry and heavy on juicy poultry.  The best part of my meal without a doubt.  Banh Mi: No slouch itself with melt in your mouth pork belly and veggies that were the right proportion with the bun.  WTF Moment: Walked in to see no lineup to order food and easily got a table to myself... at 7:30 on a Wednesday... WHA?!?  Next Time: I would do this all over again... with less mayo"}
{"text":"Pork belly sandwich is great, and the squid one is also good. The sandwich size is very good as well and ingredients seem fresh. Good combination. We also ate the fries with meat and kimchi - apart front he kimchi it was very good - but I do not like kimchi, so not a problem with the restaurant. Great little place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place is great! My sister and I both got the pulled pork. For a sandwich that also comes on a baguette, it's a great price. $6.20 (after tax) makes me prefer this place over Subway any day!"}
{"text":"A must goto stop in downtown Toronto. All the food is fresh and so tasty! The Pork Belly is flavorful and tender. I still need to try the KimChi Fries but I am already hooked on this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Toronto and that's after traveling there weekly for a year. They have two locations and both are consistent and equally good. The staff are young, hip and friendly even to older folk, like me : )    Grilled Pork Banh Mi and Duck Confit Banh Mi are both decent and okay to try and I never tried the taco's . The Steam Bao are best here and some of the best bao's that I ever had. The Pork Belly bao and Fried Chicken Bao are each remarkably good.  Everyone loves the KimChi Fries and for good reason but I preferred the Jicama Papaya Salad.... just outstanding.   Bouns: Unadvertised, you may want to try the \"Club Bao\" is a secret menu item that is steamed bun loaded with fried chicken and a slab of pork belly. :)"}
{"text":"Bang Mi Boys is a more modern twist on your traditional Banh Mi sandwiches. It's a no brainer to like a place that offers tasty food for the budget conscious. Anything from bahn mi sandwiched to steamed bao, to tacos, to fries and salads. My personal favourite is the kalbi bahn mi, five spice pork belly, and  the kimchi fries. You can change the level of spice from mild to habanero! Being the spicy food lover that I am, the habanero is too hot! It was worth it to suffer through consuming it but the after affects were not so hot. Haha!  Service is fast and efficient. They are quick to bring out your order. One critique I would say is that the staff needs to also focus on wiping the tables once In a while. Especially if the table is filled with used tissue and kimchi stains. For good food, your table should always be clean.  Other than that, I would recommended this place if you are looking to try out a more Canadian twist on Vietnamese cuisine. It's not authentic, but the flavours are delicious enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"Came in from the cold and found a warm and energetic atmosphere- cooked to order with friendly service, we ordered the duck confit, club bao and kimchi bao. The club bao was amazing - fried chicken and pork belly with a nice Korean kick using the spicy pepper paste. Interesting as the food is viet but with strong hints of Korean - kimch, gojujjang in several of the menu items :) nice touch for sure.  Limited seating and can get cold during the night but inhaled every bit of food.   Excellent for on the go food!"}
{"text":"So after hearing tons of hype, my friend and I decided to check this place out. We went at 2PM on a Friday afternoon and it was packed. Most people seemed to take this stuff to go, but we waited around for 10-15 minutes for spots to clear so we could sit down. There is limited seating so you gots to be swifter than T-Swift.  I got the fried chicken steamed bao. Asked for extra spicy but it seems all they did was add two slices of jalapeno peppers which did nothing for it. Basically like a chicken nugget in a bun. I didn't think there'd be so much veggies in a tiny little bao, I mean if I wanted a salad, I'd go to Fresh. Fries on side were good but not as impressed with the bao so wouldn't come back. My friend got the kalbi beef banh mi and kimchi fries, but she wasn't impressed by either of the two items either. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favourites around Queen and Spadina. My order is always super quick and though there isn't a lot of seating I always manage to grab a spot as someone is leaving :)"}
{"text":"(3.5 stars) after a long jog on the school's track, decided to come by for some of the recommended picks. I had my premonitions about this place because I've eaten traditional banh mi since childhood from Nguyen Hoang in China town, so I anticipated the banh mi was going to be different since this place seems very Americanized. We ordered the kimchi fries, the five spice pork banh mi, and the five spice pork bao.  Kimchi fries 5/5--damn. This is something that I didn't expect, yet it was a pleasant surprise! Something about the onions, mayo, pulled pork, fries, and kimchi.. pulls the poutine together at the end and leaves me with a lasting impression and craving for more! This is a must try for those who haven't been here before.  Banh mi 2/5-- like I said, this is very different from the traditional banh mi. There was the pickled carrots and parsley which was similar, but they added this radish. Not sure how I feel about it. The pork belly also didn't go well with the dry baguette. We got medium with sriracha hot sauce, so that spiced it up a bit. This banh mi is too dry. Traditional ones have lard spread on one side and meat paste on the other side. They also have \"cha\" which is also a type of pork that was previously wrapped in tree leaves to season. Definitely like the cha more. Overall nothing too special.  Bao 3/5--this was like a steamed white flour bun. I thought the bun itself was done well, moist enough as well. The five spices pork goes much better with the bao.  Overall 3.5 stars. The kimchi fries were innovative!"}
{"text":"A great vietnamese place. My friends and I totally love this place, it is our usual food hangout after skating. My favourite is the kimchi fries."}
{"text":"Long day of meetings, dazzled by too many dinner choices at Yonge and Dundas and starving, I found myself in Bahn Mi Boys.  They take the traditional vietnamese submarine sandwich and sex it up in all the right ways.  I had the kalbi beef sandwich:  Korean short rib, kim chee, grated carrots, cilantro and magic sauces.  The hot options were: not, mild, spicy and very spicy.  Next time I'll opt for very spicy. Just spicy had bark but no bite.  Nearby tacos looked terrific, kimchi fries looked like a must-try, at least once. Service was fast and friendly.  Big sandwich and a drink came to less than 10 bucks.  Way to go, boys."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Where do I begin?!  The place is a hole in the wall and there's very little seating so be prepared for that.  I had kimchi fries and the kalbi taco - AMAZING. The ingredients are so well fermented and seasoned. The fries and kalbi came out hot - not scorching hot but definitely not lukewarm, which is hard when running a specialty fast food joint.  I like to add a lot of hot sauce to my foods (especially tacos) but with the burst of flavored in this taco, there's no need! Both dishes were seasoned so well, I didn't feel anything lacking. Everything is so affordable too!  The only reason I gave this place 4/5 is because of the cleanliness. The tables are dirty and the previous groups food droppings are left all over the chairs and floors. But I'm ok because the food is bomb! When I go back, I'm gonna try the pork belly taco and of course the kimchi fries again. :)"}
{"text":"Best deal in Toronto. Delicious food for under $10. Get one Banh Mi sandwich or two Bao buns and be good. Awkward flow for ordering and pick up, limited seating, but it doesn't matter in the end because the food is awesome and the price can't be beat.   I had the sweet potato fries, lemongrass tofu banh mi, and panko fried tofo bao. All good."}
{"text":"In a time where even a burger and fries costs over $8 it's great to have the BMB around. Although its hard to find a seat it's worth grabbing something here if your in the area for cheap eats and a nice change from the usual hotdog/shwarma fix.   The staff are always friendly and lively and are more than happy to help you decide if your unsure. Kimchi fries are a nice touch and easy to share."}
{"text":"Greatness can't live without trying these at least once in your life and after trying you can't live without, the fried chicken bun :O ..... Plus a visit to Toronto can't possibly fail. Great ingredients great portions and haven't had anything close to this good else where.      Bump"}
{"text":"I love this place -- perfect for a lunch pick-me-up that's not too expensive, filling, and delicious! It does get busy at peak hours, so the line up to get your order can be filled with a lot of people in a tight area. It's a little annoying just waiting for you meal with a bunch of people pushing and trying to get by.  Having said that, their squid tacos are amazing. If you go there, definitely get one of those with a side of sweet potato fries + mayo."}
{"text":"It used to be good, but now my senses tell me that they buy their vegetables and kimchi from Costco and its really had a negative impact on the taste of their food. Let me know when they go back to home cooking."}
{"text":"Make sure you come before the lunch power hour because this play gets packed very quickly! Amazing kimchi fries, the sandwich is not that impressive, but definitely in a touristy place. Great for visiting from out of town! Not a lot of space to sit down and eat"}
{"text":"The fried chicken bowchicawowow is Delicious!! Tasty tasty food!  Cheap, quick and damn good!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken bao is delicious and should always be on your list of things to order. I have been here a few times and tried a variety of other dishes but they are always just ok. I don't get what everyone loves about it!  but the fried chicken bao ... that I understand!"}
{"text":"based on reviews....made an effort to try this place.  Worth the long walk.  Very fresh food, good service and amazing sandwiches.  Any chance they want to open a place in Boston??? :)"}
{"text":"Damn. This place is the bees knees.   I'm Vietnamese so I have an idea what a good banh mi sandwich is comprised of. Although this is more of a fusion banh mi place, it's still bomb dignity! It brings a modern twist to the traditional. We ordered the grilled pork banh mi, five spice pork belly bao and the kim chi fries. Each of these were so well-balanced in flavors. The meats were rich yet sweet and savory, the picked veggies added tanginess, the cucumber and cilantro added freshness. And the kim chi fries. Brilliant idea.   The thing is, this place is super small! If you wanna eat in, come in with a buddy that will save you a seat while you order and wait for the food. Otherwise, I love this place! Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food - really big portions that are very fairly priced. The staff were friendly as well! It took a little longer than I thought it would with it being empty but it was so fresh and delicious, I'd wait all over again!"}
{"text":"Conflicted on the rating for this place. The selection of sandwiches is pretty limited, and while tasty, only a few of them are good enough to draw you back. Three stars would be reasonable, if it weren't for the kimchi fries (a crazy concoction of fries, kimchi, pulled pork, mayo, and onion), which deserve a star on their own. 4 stars it is then."}
{"text":"Korean - Vietnamese Fusion that is to die for. Honestly some of the tastiest sandwiches in the city at prices you can't beat. Standard sandwiches are served on a long baguette, nice and crisp bread with fresh veggies and delicious meats no matter what you choose. I really love that they started serving smaller slider style sandwiches on baos, the sweet steamed Chinese buns you often find at dim sum. The sweetness goes well and is a little easier to munch on than the sandwiches if you have a smaller mouth. Really great flavours and great prices. Very convenient as well, you can order beforehand to skip the lines if you want to avoid the lunch rush. Kim chi fries are delicious and they also have nice selection of beverages with cold coffees and some other nice touches. Definitely worth a try if your ever in midtown area or down near their queen street location!"}
{"text":"The service here was pretty slow, but I guess that's to be expected when the place is this busy and popular, which is ultimately a good thing. I got the kimchi fries, my first time trying them, and a pork belly bao. The fries were really good but I've had better bao for sure. They also didn't offer up or have available any extra sauces, a must for bao imo."}
{"text":"So cheap and so good! We loved the friendly people working there, the food quality, the old-school hip hop playing, and the whole vibe. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time at Banh Mi Boys, and I'm usually not a fan of Banh. I ordered the duck confit sandwich and a friend ordered some kimchi fries to share.   The sandwich was okay, the pieces of duck were tasty. But overall, I found it a bit bland. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, I know these guys are legends in the Toronto food scene. The kimchi fries were solid though, I really enjoyed them.   The store is a simple and unassuming place, you place your order, grab a seat, then go get your food when it's ready. Quick and efficient, it's a good place to stop by for a fast bite that's different from your usual fast food offerings."}
{"text":"I went here the other day with my friend and it was good! We had the porkbelly and the kimchi fries."}
{"text":"Been here several times and I love this place! I've tried the pork belly bao, the kalbi taco, and the beef cheek and pork banh mis. my favourite being the pork belly bao and the pork banh mi. Surprisingly I wasn't a big fan of the kalbi taco since the meat wasn't as tender as anticipated, and it was messy to eat in that the juice kept spilling out. For the beef cheek bahn mi, I liked it, but for some reason the marinade used for the beef cheek just wasn't as delicious compared to the pork bahn mi in my personal opinion. Pork belly bao was great, really flavourful, and though it looks small, I actually found it surprisingly filling. (BTW, if you guys haven't caught on, I did not eat all these in a single trip, though I would if I could). The combination of flavours in their food is so well thought out, where ingredients that I usually hate (ex. kimchi and parsley/cilantro/corriander..you know what I mean) becomes acceptable and even delicious when coupled with the other ingredients they use to flavour their food. In addition to the amazing food quality, and reasonable portions, Banh Mi Boys is definitely the go-to place for lunch if you're in the area. My only complaint would be the somewhat long wait time for the food (even when they're not busy), and the lack of space, but the food generally makes it all worth it in the end :) ."}
{"text":"Their kimchi fries were AMAZING. The fries were crispy from beginning to end. It has pulled pork, bbq pork bits, mayo, kimchi and green onion. Super delicious!"}
{"text":"Soooooooo good! I always love coming to Banh MI Boys because it isn't that expensive (well compared to other university options nearby) and it's so tasty! I got the Pork Banh Mi (I think....., it's been a few days) and the Fried Chicken Bao on the side. The Banh MI was delicious as usual but the Bao captured my heart. Yet again, SO GOOD"}
{"text":"I had the grilled pork banh mi which was ok. The meat to vegetable ratio was off with the amount of meat being overwhelming. Not to mention that the seasoning on the meat was nothing exceptional.   Mediocre."}
{"text":"The food here was a refreshing change. I tried the Kimchee fries,  the grilled chicken sandwich and a taste of the pork belly sandwich. I guess I'm an outlier but didn't feel it was 5 star worthy.  I enjoyed the sandwich, the buns were nicely toasted and I loved the pickled veggies. Fresh Cilantro was generously added and a good fit. I was not too crazy about the mayo, I will leave it off next week. The grilled chicken was just average in my opinion - not enough meat either (especially compared to the pork belly sandwich). The Pork Belly is a little more unique and I will get this next time.  The Kimchee fries were good but had the mayo on them again. I thought the pulled port went really well with the fries and the Kimchee added unique flavour. I would get them again.    Service was a standout. The cashier was so friendly and when your sandwich is ready, they ask you about spice level. Given how crazy busy it was, Kudos to the staff for not loosing their cool and staying upbeat.  The place was a little small though. My food was ready and had to wait for a table as the wall stands and tables were all full. I was a little annoyed as everyone was squished into a corner waiting for their orders. This cramped busy atmosphere resulted in one less star for me.   I will be back when I'm in the area to try some other menu options.  BK"}
{"text":"The bao buns were amazing as was the kimchi and pork fries.  I've had better banh mi, but this place wasn't bad. The Asian tacos dishes were really unique. I would definite come here again and eat the bao buns and tacos with the side of kimchi fries."}
{"text":"The place is packed, so unless you are ready to hang around for a while to find a place, you may want this to go.  Anyway - its damn delicious. All of them."}
{"text":"TL;DR - Service is very fast and the food is very good, awesome bang for the buck. 5 spice pork bao, fried chicken bao, and the squid taco are A+  Long -  From Vancouver, so asian food is my jam. Went here twice in one week. #1: had the 5 spice pork bao and the kalbo beef banh mi. That bao was amazing, hands down. Tender and juicy and the right kind of fatty with perfect pickle:meat:bun ration. SO GOOD. The kalbi beef banh mi is apparently their most popular, but it was meh compared to what I can get from other Vietnamese restaurants.  #2: got the 5 spice pork bao again, still amazing. Also got the fried chicken bao - also SO GOOD. Moist and wonderful crunch and great sauce. Final item was the highly recommended squid taco. Yes. Good. Do it. The squid taco taco part was more like roti and so tasty."}
{"text":"I would have posted more pics if I didn't eat it so fast. The fusion of Vietnamese, Chinese and korean cultures perfected into a pillowy bao is just too good.  I've tried the kimchi Fries (fries, spicy kimchi, green onions and a tasty mayo) has a combination that just works. Trust me get it, but maybe split it with a friend so you can enjoy a bao .  I tried so far the tofu taco (trust me get it with the slaw), Panko tofu bao, calamari taco and chicken bao. All so good. The baos are my favourite. It's a soft pillowy 'taco' like thing that holds the delicious fried chicken, pickled veggies and a sauce are have that perfect balance of flavours.  Ironically I haven't tried the banh Mi here. You can choose your spice level - I usually go for 'hot= jalapeno' the next level to try is the habanero.  It's a tiny place with limited seats, but they do take out!  For dessert there's plenty of options nearby!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food, the concept and the execution! I love banh mi and knowing that Toronto has a large Chinatown, I was very excited to see what they had to offer. When doing my research, I found a lot of potentially great establishments but the Banh Mi Boys concept just popped off the list as not only having a quality banh mi with a strong selection of meats, but also Asian inspired tacos and steamed bao.  The roll on the banh mi was top notch and even held up well to the meatballs with a generous amount of tomato hoisin sauce we had. The meatballs were tasty and tender and everything I was hoping for. Despite there being a bit too much sauce, I really enjoyed the combination. The 5 spice pork belly bao had a generous, thick slice of pork belly and was surprisingly well balanced. The pork belly was nicely seared and had some fat on it but was plenty meaty and 5 spice wasn't overpowering like it can be sometimes. The pickled veg cut through the richness and made for a pork belly bun that is one of the best I've had.  The best one of the bunch though was the kalbi taco with a roti pancake replacing the traditional tortilla and banh mi style toppings along with kimchee and cabbage slaw. Reasonably spicy with jalapeno sticks, the short rib was perfectly seasoned and we devoured it quickly.   I walked out of the busy restaurant hoping that something like it would come to Rochester and loving the concept so much that I found myself dreaming of opening a similar establishment. Must see!"}
{"text":"I expect more than that!!! Nothing special for a 7-buck banh mi. It is ABSOLUTELY TASTELESS!!! Also, the recommended Kimchi Fries is tooooo sweet. They gave me a bunch of sliced meat in my banh mi and Kimchi Fries, which I couldn't recognize it. Overall, this food store is overrated. I'd rather have a Hero Burger nearby then."}
{"text":"This was by far the best food I got to taste while I was food touring Toronto. I love me some fried chicken and it did not disappoint. The chicken was juicy and full of flavor. On top of that you get these crisp julienne veggies that add texture and freshness. Kimchi fries are a burst of flavor. I love french fries. Its like french fries and kimchi had a baby in your mouth. The kalbi beef bahn mi was so good. Kalbi beef, veggies in between this crunchy yet soft baguette. Pork belly just melts in your mouth. You get some fattiness and you get a little of the pork meat all in one. I'm sure everything on their menu tastes delicious so you couldn't go wrong. I highly recommend the fried chicken baos (get as many as you can), the five spice pork belly baos and you better not leave without ordering some kimchi fries. Inside is small. You're either ordering to go or dining in (if there are seats available). Nice spot to chill with friends."}
{"text":"This was my first visit with a friend here. When you walk in, you are hit with such flavorful aroma - makes everything seem so appetizing. There was a lineup, but it moved fairly quick. There  aren't a lot of seats available - but this isn't a problem if you are taking it to go.   At first glance, I was so surprised at the pricing - it is very decent considering what they give you. We ordered the Kimchi Fries, Pork Belly Bao and Braised Beef Bahn Mi. My favourite had to be the Bao. So delicious. My only regret was having to share half of it with my friend. The kimchi fries were alright. It's good, but perhaps a bit on the salty side for me. I am quite particular about my kimchi - so Im biased here. However, my friend who visits from time to time tells me that the Kimchi Fries are his absolute fav. For the Bahn Mi, everything was good except the meat. Perhaps we shouldn't have ordered braised beef. Instead we really should have tried pork belly or pork Bahn Mi. I found the braised beef to be a bit tasteless, so it didn't go that well with the rest of the ingredients.   The service is actually pretty quick considering how many people there were. There were a lot of staff in the cooking/prep area though. Overall, I'd go back again, and this time, I'm getting my own pork belly bao!"}
{"text":"Steam Bao sandwiches are cheap, filling, and delicious. Choose any flavor and you will be happy. Kimchi fries are dynamite too, love this place."}
{"text":"Both locations are good, this place should franchise across NA. People love good cheap eats."}
{"text":"Cheap and Cheerful is how I would describe this place. The food is cheap and the tastes are cheerful. I've never had a bad experience here. This place is great if you're like me and get sick of eating a plate of one thing because you have the option of ordering a variety of items that won't break the bank.   I tend to steer towards the steamed Bao.. (I've had the chicken, the tofu and the beef cheek.. all of which, delightful). I usually pair it with some sweet potato fries.  Don't be intimidated by it's packed appearance, the line moves fast and they take real pride in the food they are making so although it's quick, it's never rushed in quality."}
{"text":"Very heavy on the smells, so not the best place to dine in.  The duck sandwich is my favourite, but then again it's the only thing I've had here.  Be prepared for a small line up, but the excitement and taste of the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Love the banh mis here. My fave is kalbi baguette sandwich. Kind of sweet, spicy, filling, kimchi, nom nom nom  Not a lot of sitting, more for takeout or a swift eat and go, I think.  Mannn and the kimchi fries, so good."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Cheap and great quality. I had beef taco and pork belly steamed bao. Everything looks great.  Hip place."}
{"text":"Consistently great. Love coming here. Friendly and efficient staff."}
{"text":"Kimchi Fries!  That was a neat combination that worked really well.  Taco's are pretty good too but smaller portions than I would have liked.  I guess all taco's are like that though.  I only dropped 1 star because the place wasn't that clean, felt like they never wiped the tables and there are soooo many customers so obviously it will be a bit messy.  But the food was great!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in over a year!    I had the club bao yesterday.  The pork belly was a bit dry.  I'm still a fan of the fried chicken though.  I will order each separately next time."}
{"text":"The kimchi and fries (especially with pulled pork on top) is a combination made in heaven. It may sound a bit odd, but your taste buds will thank you for opening its senses to this delicacy.  Personally, I think the steamed baos complement the juiciness of the grilled meat better than banh mis. Pork belly bao YUUUUUM."}
{"text":"I was expecting excellent, but all I got was OK. The slaw, rather than the main filling, made up most of the flavour and the wrap was too dense for me. Overall, decent take-out but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Bah mi boys is delicious without a doubt and the great part of this place as opposed to others is the amount of meat you get in the sandwhich- definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite fast food restaurants in the GTA.  They offer great food at a very affordable price and the service is top notch!  Everytime I come here I am left satisfied and wanting more.   My personal favourites are the pork belly and duck banh mi.  I also love their kim chi fries and nice selection of sides.   The menu is nice, short and sweet, but gives people enough selection for many more trips to come.  Be sure to add a little of that hot rooster sauce to yoir banh mi for that added kick, with peppers on the side!  Can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is legit and here's why:  1. Extremely delicious and as close to fusion authentic Vietnamese Banh Mi as you can get.  The pork belly, beef and duck Banh Mi are all great and it's hard to choose just one each time I visit.  2. Sides are great, especially the Kimchi fries, which come in a healthy serving enough to feed 2 people!  3. The service is friendly and fast.  From the time that I get my order in and pick up my food, it's less than 10 minutes.  The staff are friendly and answer all your questions quickly and efficiently.    4. The place is clean!  You would expect a place right at the downtown core to have a bombed out washroom assaulted by the homeless, but not here.  The washroom is spotless and I don't have to hold my nose and close my eyes when I go inside.  Awesome place with great food, staff, music and overall atmosphere.  Thanks"}
{"text":"I've been avoiding this place as I figured it was overpriced Vietnamese food.... And I was right.   Wasn't the biggest fan of the banh mi. The baguette itself was fairly average, as were the contents. The \"pork belly\" was only okay. I'd rather go to Chinatown and get one for a lot less $.   The bao was pretty mediocre too, but the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --  I couldn't believe hubby had never tried banh mi in his entire life. Since Banh Mi Boys is one of the best Banh Mi places in Toronto, I decided to bring hubby here for his first Banh Mi Experience. The store was quite narrow and there were a limited number of tables. I was surprised by the price, everything was priced reasonably and there were plenty of options to pick from. I was lucky enough to find a table there. I found the store was not very clean and the table was kinda sticky.   -- Food and Drink --  After checking fellow Yelpers' reviews, we ordered the following items:  1. 5 Spice Pork Belly Banh Mi - This was one of the best foods that I have ever tried. To me, the portion size of the banh mi was very huge. The pork belly was very thick and crispy. For some reason, I found the pork belly tasted like Chinese Peking Duck! The fat melted in my mouth and it wasn't oily at all. There were plenty of veggies on the banh mi. The pickled carrots, cucumbers, cabbage and parsley were very fresh! The banh mi was toasted to be very cripsy! The siracha sauce and mayo went well with the bun! This was definitely one of the best buns I have ever eaten! :)   2. Braised Beef Banh Mi - The braised beef tasted liked beef jerky, but the texture was definitely softer than jerky. My husband liked this banh mi more than the pork belly one.   3. Kimchi Fries - This is one of the top 5 poutine I have ever tasted. I never imagined kimchi would go well with fries. It was so cheesy! After eating the banh mi, I was very full and had to take out the kimchi fries.   -- Overall --  I never had such a wonderful experience eating vietnamese banh mi. I would love to come back to try their tofu fries and duck confit banh mi! :)))"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for some time now and am so glad they opened up a second location closer to the office.  I ordered the five spice pork belly banh mi with kimchi fries to share. My friend ordered the grilled chicken bao and the beef cheek bao. It was all tasty!  Once in a while I get that craving for banh mi and this place definitely satisfies it!   There are limited seats here so I do recommend getting there right at noon before the crowd comes in. But it is definitely worth the wait.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't consider myself to be a vegetarian but I would say that 3/4 of my meals are meatless.  One thing I've noticed about most vegetarian banh mi sandwiches is that they're usually really nasty!  They tend do be an afterthought.  Most of the time, it seems like they're filled with leftover veggies from other dishes.  However, I was very happy with my lemongrass tofu banh mi!  It was delicious and one of the best meals I had in Toronto.  The rest of the menu looked really good as well.  I would have gone back to try more but I wanted to try out other restaurants.  I'll definitely come back for another banh mi if I'm ever back in Toronto."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches and friendly staff.  We both had the grilled chicken on a baguette. Everything was perfect. Homemade French fries. Definitely will return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is a must-stop location in Toronto if you're looking for affordable, fast, flavourful food. I'm vegetarian so I always order the Tofu Banh Mi *and* the Panko-Crusted Tofu Bao... it's honestly too much food for one person but it's rare that I get to visit Banh Mi Boys so I can't help myself!  What I love about Banhi Mi Boys Banh Mi versus other restaurants (mainly ones in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where I live) --- THEY'RE NOT DRY! Sauce is plentiful, especially if you accept mayo on your sandwich. Your sandwich will drip a little if you get mayo & sriracha (the medium spice level). No one likes a dry Banh Mi which is why Banh Mi Boys will always reign supreme.  Service is quick so don't be discouraged by long lines. If you see a table, grab it! Space is limited so be prepared to get your food to go."}
{"text":"My first experience of Bahn Mi Boys was good, but it wasn't amazing.   Beef Brisket Bahn Mi - I felt the beef brisket was a little too sweet, athough I do like sweet things, but it was a little too noticeable for me.   Kimchi Fries - This was surprisingly really good! I highly recommend.   5 spiced pork belly steamed bao - This was alright, but the pork belly was a little slim to what I've had at other places. The pork wasn't highlighted as much as I would have liked with all the other delicious pickled veggies inside"}
{"text":"Flavourful sandwich but at a high price point.  We arrived at Bahn Mi Boys just before the lunch hour. Efficient and friendly staff but I'm not sure how I feel about the high counter while your sandwich is being prepped.  I had the grilled pork Bahn Mi but I found the meat very chewy. My friend ordered the chicken steamed bao and that was pretty good.  I think for a quick, take-out lunch, Bahn Mi is OK, but for over $6 a sandwich, it seems a bit pricey for the quality."}
{"text":"Well, I've lived in Toronto my whole life, and I've worked in the restaurant industry for over 3 years, and I just finally made it to Banh Mi Boys.    Have you ever seen the Futurama episode where everyone has that glooby globy thing attached to their heads, and it sucks at their brains, and makes them zombie-followers?  No offense to the tastebuds of all the Yelpers I love, but I felt like that at Banh Mi Boys.  I felt like the only one without the glooby globy on my head.  I had the pork belly bao.  It's interesting, because I've had the pork buns at Noodle Bar, and I have only read very mixed reviews about them on here.  But to me, they were leaps and bounds better than what I got at Banh Mi.  The bao was falling apart, the pork belly wasn't soft and buttery, but hard and charred, and (admittedly, I'm a cilantro hater so I had it without cilantro!) the topping seemed to not go so well with the rest of the tastes?  The bathrooms were beyond gross, you could smell them from a top the stairs...  So why 3 stars? Well, I could see promise.  I could almost taste the Kool-Aid, and I finished up my bao, so it wasn't terrible.  But I need a revisit for my final decision."}
{"text":"Came here last thursday for lunch. I had the beef cheek Banh Mi and the Steamed Pork Bao. They were both good and very hearty but I just felt like the spicing wasn't quite up to par. I'd go back to try the tofu fries and some other things.  Rerate as of yesterday: 20/02/ 14. Came here last night with the Girlfriend, had the Pork Belly Banh Mi and the Chicken Taco. Spicing was better and the pork belly quite soft. My girlfriend had the Kimchi Fries. They were amazing.  It was super busy in there last night, but we managed to snag a seat."}
{"text":"Great fast eats! Visiting toronto for the first time from a place not too keen on Asian food (I.e. no LA). Had three bahn mi sandwiches and the kimchi fries. Both great food to munch on, and the fries are worth the hype! Must try and pretty fast service despite the line being out the door during lunch hour. Hoping they can expand not just their franchise more (with two locations already) but the locations themselves as they do get crammed."}
{"text":"5 Stars for the grilled pork banh mi! - These are not your grandfather's Banh Mi sandwiches, there's no pate nor mayo, just caramelized grilled pork deliciousness, with sweet pickled veggies and your preferred level of heat. Perfect!  3 stars for the kimchi fries, - I love kimchi, I love fries, the combination, with all the sauce and everything, is just too busy for me.  2 stars for the porkbelly bao - the meat was not as nicely caramelized as one would hope, and the bao is too doughy and bland, and personally just doesnt do it for me. Stick to the sandwiches on their outstanding panini/baguette style rolls.  I found this location to be just a half-step behind the Yonge & Gerrard location, but still great, the wait isn't anywhere near as bad, plus there is street parking here, so its a winner overall.  I've tried all of their sandwiches, most are great, but with balanced flavours, yummy carmelized meat, and overall deliciousness, for me, their #1 grilled pork banh mi is always a winner, plus it's also the cheapest sandwich on their menu!  Go for it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  I have only had the banh mi, but I have tried every version on their menu, and they are all pretty great. Surprisingly, my favorite is the cheapest one too, the grilled pork banh mi, because it has more meat than the pork belly, and a nicer overall balance of flavours than the beef.  The chewy, crusty, yet soft roll, the crunchy sweet-pickled julienne carrot and daikon, the fresh cilantro, a shot of heat, and the sticky-sweet-and-savoury tender pork, grilled-to-order, it's just about sandwich perfection.  This is not your typical $2 banh mi, which I love as well (Hello Nguyen Huong Scarborough!) but Banh Mi Boys is a totally different delicious fusion of chinese, viet and korean deliciousness.  5 STARS for the food - no question, but minus -1 star for the minimal cramped seating, the location that has no parking within 1000 miles, plus the far-too-early closing time.  I wish there was a northern location open late for perfect after-party eats, or something suburban with some seating and parking, so maybe I could sit and relax and even  try those kimchi fries with my banh mi. :)  Regardless, just go, it's worth risking the parking ticket!"}
{"text":"I have seen this place featured on TV a few times and had been wanting to try it for a really long time and I have to say, I was pretty disappointed.  I ordered two bao, the pork belly and the fried chicken and the wait was quite long. I probably waited 15 minutes while at least a dozen people behind me in line were served their food. They said it was because the fried chicken takes longer to make so I was okay with that but when I opened up the fried chicken bao I realized the reason it took so long was because they obviously used a square, chicken patty that they just dropped in the fryer from frozen. Not like some of the pictures here! It was luke warm and flaked oddly, which actually made me wonder for a second if I was eating fish.  Really disappointed with that; if I wanted frozen chicken like that, I would buy some frozen chicken from No Frills and eat it at home. The pork belly bao was pretty good but I ordered both baos spicy and didn't get it. Also saw a bunch of staff standing around, joking and not doing anything while there was plenty to do because of a line of people and a bunch of tables that needed cleaning.  Long story short, not the worst but definitely doesn't live up to expectations. Maybe the Queen St location is better?"}
{"text":"I didn't think a bahn mi sandwich place could impress me so much. I was actually in disbelief at how good Bahn Mi Boyz was--in terms of food, service, price...it seems they've got everything down pat. For $6.50, I got their braised beef bahn mi--it was huge, filling, flavourful, juicy, tender...and soo worth it. I got my order in under 5  minutes--the fastest i think I've ever been served at a fast-food type place. Unfortunately was too full to try their kimchi fries, but will definitely be coming back here for that...and more!!"}
{"text":"When I visited Toronto for the film festival, my group of friends and I ate here for dinner one night. I've had Vietnamese sandwiches before (from where I live, which is NYC) and I am obsessed with them! They are so tasty. I was very excited when we decided to eat here. I ordered squid tacos which were so good! Definitely recommend getting them!   However it is very narrow and small in here. The line was long and we had to fight for seats."}
{"text":"After a long drive up into Canada, all me and my friends wanted was a nice, hot meal somewhere. We came here because my friend vaguely remembered the place during his last trip to Toronto.  The place was the basic definition of modernized Asian cuisine. The interior of bright colors, graffiti, and LCD menus like decorations gave it a young hip vibe. The menu had a bunch of banh mi (a traditionally Vietnamese submarine sandwich), tacos, steamed bao buns, and assorted appetizers. I went with the Five Spice Pork Belly Banh Mi with a side of Kimchi Fries.The wait was really short and the staff was super nice, asking me exactly how I wanted my sandwich.   The food itself was what I kinda expected: not as good as the real thing but still has the basics down. The bread was nice and toasty. The pork belly was cooked well, but was more on the fatty side and didn't have too much distinct flavoring to it. I asked for jalapeños because I like it spicy, but unfortunately, they added nothing to the spiciness. Overall, a well put together sandwich of a good value. The kimchi fries were bizarre and a nice fusion side dish. The kimchi on top was a little mushy and you get BBQ pork sprinkled on top was a little too sweet. There were also patches of fries that had too much mayo (read: drenched). However, everything came together in the end and I enjoyed my relatively inexpensive dinner. Just make sure if you order fries, share them!  Pros: friendly staff, innovative interior, quick service, lots of choice Cons: limited seating (7 small tables), loss of authenticity for modernity  Dishes to try: Kimchi Fries"}
{"text":"Well... all their food is under 10$!! So for some cheap food that is tasty and delicious, I would definitely recommend this spot. Unfortunately, if you're vegan, their bread buns and steamed buns contain milk *sad face*. So this meant that they only had one vegan option- the Tofu Taco! I ordered one tofu taco ($4.50) and some sweet potato fries ($3.75).   So the taco was really delicious!! Lots of veggies and delicious flavour. Very interesting take on a taco! The tofu was juicy, tasty, and smokey. Then the vegetables brought some freshness to the mix! All in all, I enjoyed it a lot! Will definitely be coming back when I feel like eating out.   I ate my food at the restaurant as there was a fair amount of seating space!   Super recommend checking this place out if you get the chance!! Hopefully they come up with more vegan options of find a way to make their buns vegan!!! I hope to try some one day!"}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Banh Mi Boys ever since it originally opened in the winter of 2012. As far as I know I have had every item on the menu. So when I say that this place is 5 stars you know I'm not fucking around.  I vividly remember one particular meal during March of 2012. I was working at an agency in the neighbourhood on a particularly troublesome account that was giving everyone headaches. After working until 4am the previous evening I came in at 8am to get an early start. I proclaimed to everyone that I was ready to, \"kill it\". I then went ahead and put in a morning of work so half-assed that it would make Wally from Dilbert jealous. At exactly noon I went to Banh Mi Boys to meet a friend for lunch. Filled with frothing rage I decided to go big and ordered a Pork Belly Banh Mi, Fried Chicken Bao and an order of Kim Chi Fries. I went back to work, vomited everywhere and took the afternoon off. It was kismet."}
{"text":"When I lived nearby, I came here rather frequently. I would recommend the basic pulled pork banh mis and kimchi fries. Note that the kimchi fries are pretty filling, so only on days that I was super hungry would I get kimchi fries + a banh or bao."}
{"text":"Went back for a second time to try the takeout and the food was meh. I don't see the hype of this place its overly priced and the staff isn't all that great. The cashier couldn't spell my name properly. For the price I have to pay to go there and order its ridiculous. Never going back. Service was medicore."}
{"text":"Great place to have a quick bite that will keep you full for couple hours. Which ever sandwich you choose, you won't be disappointed. They are all good. My favorite is the chicken and pork belly bun."}
{"text":"I used to regularly visit this establishment with my friends and while the food is great the customer service is really lacking and leaves much to be desired. Example: Let's say you are the restaurant owner and you offer delivery services via UberEats or SkipTheDishes however for whatever reason you forgot to include ANY drink options on the delivery menu for purchase despite having two fridges full of drinks available in store, so a customer who doesn't have access to cold refreshments in the hot summer months is either forced to go out and buy the drink separately or contact the courier/restaurant for purchase of drinks over the phone. However you are told by the restaurant that they will no longer be allowing customers to purchase drinks and this is the last time they will be doing you a FAVOR! My friends you are in the business of providing customer service and you should not look for ways to make it harder on your customers but rather strive to provide the best possible service to set your self apart from the competition. At Banh Mi Boys clearly this is not the objective as inconveniencing customers and giving ultimatums are the more preferred approach of doing business and I have concluded that no matter how delicious their food tastes I will never order food from this place again since they believe in ultimatums instead of looking for solutions to make the customers happy. I don't care if you want to charge me $5 for drinks but to purposely refuse to sell refreshments when you are in the food industry is quite frankly absurd! Thank you for the delicious food Banh Mi Boys but I am really disappointed in your approach when it comes to customer service and I have accepted your ultimatum and won't be making anymore purchases or referring anymore friends to eat at your restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to Bahn Mi Boys a couple times now and the food is delicious! The staffs are friendly and the place in general is pretty nice, sometimes its really busy and you might not get a seat but eventually you'll find a spot once someone is done (or not). The place has some pretty good music too. Overall the food is pretty cheap but good quality and has lots of flavours, love it!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Thursday.  I ordered the soft bao (pork belly) and the kalbi beef sandwich.  I cannot believe I have lived in this area for so long without ever eating here.  The food was amazing.  How do they get the bun so soft?!  It's the perfect perfect bun! The pickled vegetables are a lovely accompaniment.  I can't stop talking about how good this place is.  Note: If you like spicy - order it extra spicy."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE RECIEVED 4 STARS FOR THEIR KIMCHI FRIES ONLY.   If you want real banh mi go to Nguyen Houng at Jane and Wilson lmao this places' banh mi is okay; like their flavour was directed towards more white people than it was towards actual Vietnamese people.   Their cashier that day was really really nice and the enviroment seemed very relaxing to be in except for the door that would occasionally bring in the cold af -20 air everytime someone opened it. The kimchi fries are so fricking filling and delicious (if the kimchi was like actually spicy at all it wouldve been 5 stars but the flavour was enough for a 4 stars) for the price (omg the price yes).   This is legit drunk food, you dont really want spice when you're drinking lol. I also love how they give it to you in a box for takeout like lmao  best decision ever for kimchi fries of this caliber."}
{"text":"SQUID TACO! $3.95 Best snack going! I will experience the love again and again!"}
{"text":"Tried a few items here but my fav is the pork belly bahn mi or bao. The meat is cooked perfectly and I usually add the jalapeños for an extra kick.  I usually hit up the Queen West location but I find both locations quite busy. Never had an issue with the service either, they're always quick and friendly.  Price is cheap, you could easily grab a couple items for less than $10. You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys was truly love at first bite. Their grilled pork banh mi was tasty and flavorful. Their fried chicken bao crispy and fresh. Their grilled chicken taco is the perfect way to start off any meal. I'm truly a fan.  Although Banh Mi Boys maybe be tiny with only about 6 tables it's definitely worth a trip. Food is spectacular and pretty cheap. You can order your meal as mild or spicy as you like.  Only regret here was not ordering the kimchi fries. Oh well. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Kimchi fries are the bomb!!! I've tried the grilled pork banh mi and the 5 spice pork belly banh mi, both of which were amazing as well. A bit more expensive than the traditional banh mi, but reasonable and definitely worth every single penny. As with most fast food restaurants in the area, this place has limited seating and because its so popular, there's almost always a lineup (especially at lunch) but luckily its on Ritual so it may be wise to order ahead on the app. Again I have to emphasize, if you can't decide what to get, Kimchi fries are always on point ;)"}
{"text":"Very sweet spot, modern twist on the Banh Mi sandwich.   No need for a super long review but I got the grilled pork banh mi and it was great! Super juicy and tender meat, nicely toasted bread with fresh veggies. I love how they use Sriracha for hot sauce and jalapenos because it compliments the flavors well, those classic places uses habanero which is waaaay too much for spice.   The space is clean, bright and very lively. The food was made at a decent time too. The price of it is very affordable for what they put inside. They even offer baos and tacos and fries.  Great place, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys are not boys... but the King on Queen! :) (Queen street that is.)  Their Kimchi Fries are GREAT!!! The pulled pork gives it the smokiness and sweetness, the kimchi are spicy and tangy, the fries are crispy! Love it! (Had it 2 times in 3 days)  First time was with a Grilled pork banh mi, it's pretty good, but nothing really NEW to me. I guess it does lost a bit of heat from the walk back to work. Don't get me wrong, it's on the top of my list as lunch option.  Today I had Grilled chicken banh mi, I guess because they use the same \"asian bbq sauce\", it tasted pretty much the same as the grilled pork. but the dine in experience is better, they help you cut up the banh mi in to halves, so you can get right into the goodies! and the fries stays hot and crispy which is GREAT!!  They have Cherry Coke and Vanilla Coke, it's a great addition to the GREAT fries.  (Working my way down the menu)  I should try the tacos next...  now may be I should work at the corner of Queen St. & Spadina Ave...  PS. they accept credit card, which is great...  6/15"}
{"text":"When you're craving a fresh and flavourful banh mi... the kalbi banh mi is the way to go. I love how their ingredients always taste fresh and bright. If you're looking for something to eat on the go or if you want a small lunch/snack thay packs a bunch, get one of the very unique and delicious banh mis."}
{"text":"Lemongrass Tofu Bahn Mi is just ok. Needs more lemongrass, more flavor, more toasting. Tofu fries were pretty good last time. Can't say I'll be back to try it a third time."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Banh Mi Boys, I always get their Kimchi fries. They're a little spicy and there's some mayo in it, which I love. I've also gotten some of their baos and those are great too.  Overall, I haven't had a bad experience with them so far. Good quality food and good quality service."}
{"text":"I love sandwiches, and I've eaten sandwiches from so many great spots in TO.  BMB is, hands down, the best!   I must have sampled everything on the menu and I'd have to say my 2 favorite items are the grilled pork Banh Mi and the Pork Belly Bao (if ever given the opportunity to pick my last meal, the Pork Belly Bao will be on the list)."}
{"text":"I'd been hearing about Banh Mi Boys for a while and everyone was saying good things.   I finally had a chance to go when I noticed that they had a location open up at Yonge and Eglinton. If you read my reviews, you know that I eat a LOT of different Asian cuisines so it's not like I went into this place without knowing what I was likely to get myself into.  That being said, based on all of the great reviews I'd been hearing, I expected more. The food wasn't terrible but at the same time, it really didn't impress me at all? The sandwich seemed to be more bread than filling and that's a real problem for a place that specialized in Sandwiches.   I'm sure I'll get a lot of flak for this next comment but I'd almost say you'd be better off going to Subway. Sure, Banh Mi Boys does offer some interesting and somewhat unique options but for what you get at the price you pay, I think there's better value elsewhere.  I wish I could have given a better review this time but honesty is most important here on Yelp. :)"}
{"text":"I had the kalbi sandwich. It was ok, but I really enjoyed the kimchi fries.  They recently posted the health facts for some of the food here.  Lets just say I ate about 1200 calories consuming the sandwich and fries!  Was it worth it?  I'd get the fries again.  The novelty behind the sandwiches doesn't really do it for me... Mind you, I'm a big fan of regular banhmi's that can be had for $2 in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Yes, get the baos!!! The chicken bao was definitely the highlight instead of the kimchi fries. The chicken was fried perfectly, topped with cilantro, pickled carrots and mayo. I was a little disappointed in the kimchi fries. It came out looking a little sad. It looked and tasted burnt, it wasn't that great overall. So, skip the fries and get the baos."}
{"text":"Delicious food, steamed pork bun is a must try ! Also love the tacos ....   Service is excellent - helpful and efficient! It was my first time here and the guy really took his time to make sure I understood how their menu worked and made some great suggestions."}
{"text":"So looking at the reviews for this place, I knew I just had to go! I actually watched an episode of \"You gotta Eat here\" and Bahn Mi Boys looked so good. I found this place very easily and was super excited. My friend ordered the braised beef Bahn mi and grilled chicken taco and I got the kalbi beef Bahn mi and the pulled pork bao. We got our Bahn mi spicy, can't go wrong with sriracha yum! The service was still fast and friendly, considering that they were training new staff. The restaurant was small and had limited seating. We found a table that was messy, so I had to clean it before sitting down. Now this is where it all went down hill, I took a bite out of the bao and the steamed bun was so soft but the pork had this weird taste and it was cold, I couldn't continue to eat it, since I was afraid I may get sick. I then went on to my visually appealing sandwich and the beef was cold and dry. I don't like to waste food so I forcefully finished half of my sandwich. My friend also complained about the same thing and said his tasted weird. I took a bite out of his sandwich and it tasted the same way as mine. My stomach was still growling and my friend offered his chicken taco to me .. Haha (sorry that just sounded wrong) ... and it was delicious. I took two bites since it was small in size haha.. (sorry again) I wanted all of it.. Haha..okay let me stop here, can't keep my composure! *Straight face* My friend devoured it in one bite, leaving nothing behind. Damn.. We were still hungry, dissatisfied and in search for something to eat. We ended up going across the street and grabbed a poutine. I really want to give this place a second chance, so I will give it another go, hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Amazing music, friendly staff and they do Viet subs justice. I always bring out of town guests here as a quick stop to refuel, everyone loves it. Kalbi beef sub is my favourite"}
{"text":"Deliciousness from start to finish. Fusion food at its best. They really should open a store uptown in the yonge and finch area to spice up the traditional Korean and Vietnamese flavours that Dominate that area.   FOOD: Amazing! You can't go wrong with anything on this menu. The sandwhiches come with a fresh carrot slaw which adds a nice crunch to the cooked meat and soft bun. Every bite is bursting with flavour! Personal favourites: Kim chi fries with tofu and the fried chicken steamed bao. The baos are deceptively filling, so order one if you're a light eater like myself.   SERVICE: Always packed, but service is quite fast.   ATMOSPHERE: No comfortable seating, generally a take out spot. A few tables and chairs but good luck finding a seat, especially during lunch and dinner rush."}
{"text":"Lunched here for first time and sorry I didn't try this place earlier. Great food! Had a beef \"taco\" and pulled pork fries - a bit much but so delish! Loved the extras - kim chi, shredded carrots, green onions - made me feel I was eating healthy! Maybe I was, but the excellent tastes make the question moot for me! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious, fast and very friendly. This is exactly what you should expect to get  for a quick and effing tasty lunch on the streets of this amazing city of ours. Woop woop!!! Keep it up."}
{"text":"Oh this place is soooo good. Very affordable as well! I would always come back here if i am in Toronto.   A must try for tourists!!!"}
{"text":"The chain of Banh Mi Boys is definitely getting more popular. I went to the restaurant at 10pm with my friend and we were able to get fresh taco and bao.  This restaurant is mainly a fusion of Vietnamese/Korean/Chinese food with western style burger/taco. There are three main entree dish: Banh Mi (vietnamese bread with beef/duck/pork filling), Taco (with tofu/kalbi beef/pulled pork) and Steamed Bao (which stands for \"bun\" in English). I had Kalbi beef taco for my dinner and the food was great. The chef allows you to choose difference level of spiciness from 1 - 4. In order to bring out the Vietnamese culture, each dish has fillings of vietnamese mint and carrots.  For side dish, they have kimchi fries which is basically fries with lots of kimchi on top. I strongly recommend this side dish.  The greatest value proposition of Banh Mi Boys is the price for each dish. For a decent size dish, my Kabi beef taco was only $6. This is definitely worth your money and economic for students nearby."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I love this place. We can't get enough of the Fried Chicken Bao, Kalbi Beef Taco, Tofu Taco and Duck Banh Mi sandwich.   Some of the dishes seem to have a similar flavour but overall I really can't get enough of them - so much flavour at a great price. We go back all the time."}
{"text":"This place is like a glorified Nguyen Huong.  Yeah, they have more gourmet meats to put in the vietnamese sandwiches but I just found it mediocre at best.  I ordered the kalbi banh mi and the pork belly banh mi.  The fillings were good but I think they put too much of the pickled carrots in there compared to the other stuff. I didn't get to try the kimchi fries the other yelpers were raving about.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"A must-try for Toronto's meat-eaters!  Tip - I would order a couple of baos because they are pretty small :)  Banh Mi is a place that won't break the bank but offers exceptional-tasting food. I'd heard about this place for years but always hesitated to give it a try because the menu seemed a bit limited. Eventually I gave in and I have no regrets. I had the entrée chicken salad - the chicken was by all means the star (the rest of the salad was pretty good too). In retrospect, I might have wanted to try the fried/grilled chicken bao which I hear is a real winner, but the taste of it that I had in my salad left me convinced that this place was really good! Some of my co-workers ventured into the more meaty dishes and their reviews were universally positive. If you're looking for a great sandwich shop, I'd recommend that you stop by - I hear the kimchi fries are a real winner too (and if you have dietary restrictions the restaurant is quite accommodating of removing certain elements that you can't eat, at least in my experience!)."}
{"text":"Yes the food is delicious, I admit that. I had the steamed pork belly bao and kimchi fries on one occasion and a tofu banh mi with kimchi fries on another. My friend recommended me this place when I visited her in Toronto.   The reason I gave 1 star is because of their service. I saw some very terrible service, one happening to my friend and another happening to a visitor from Quebec, I suppose from their accent.   With my friend, she wanted to double check her order before paying since she does not eat pork so she changed the kimchi fries with braised beef. At the same time, she got braised beef bao so she wanted to make sure her kimchi fries are replaced with braised beef (and replacing the pork with braised beef costs an extra dollar). What she got instead from the cashier was a rude remark and attitude saying that she can't change her order and looked at my friend like she was stupid. She didn't even pay yet. We knew we can't change the order after we made the payment.  On the second occasion, one of the workers behind the counter making the food calls names to bring you up to see what condiments you want and what not. For the Quebec visitor, she couldn't catch her name clearly since I'm assuming English isn't her first language. That's fine. But the person behind the counter, when she did walk up, gave a rude remark saying how she has to speak up, how he can't understand her, when he calls her up to see which spice to put in. That's some pretty rude service to new clients and reflects how you treat people. Even though you apologized, you just blew it off saying it was a fast food chain and it has to go really fast. This was while I was waiting in line for food and honestly, no matter how great your food is, this experience definitely ruined it and I would never come back to this fast food place, maybe the other one on Queens would have better service."}
{"text":"Fried chicken, beef cheek, and pork belly bahn mi were absolutely delicious; these would be irresistible if I lived or worked close by.   Conveniently located.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is one I just cannot miss.  If I am lucky enough to work in the area I go here.  I feel bad for other restaurants near by.  I wish is hungry for two meals, so I could visit them as well.  I highly recommend the steamed baos.  The fried chicken is the best.  The amount of chicken is quite ample.  It will change your religion, if not it will change your gender!!!  The kimchi poutine they have is the bees knees.  It is quite substantial. It can really fed two people.  Order and share with a friend.    Outta 10:  Food - 12 Ambience - 8 Experience - 9  The only con is of the line is back to the door , you will starve to death before getting your food.  **** you can call ahead an order for pick up!!!"}
{"text":"Went here in the summer for the first time. Tiny location and hard to get a seat. I came with my friends whose a regular and we split steam fried chicken bao, squid tacos, kimchi fries and it was all great!"}
{"text":"I want to start this off on a positive. I came here and ordered all the choices of their buns. They have a great roster of stuff and options. Always best part about Banh Mi is that you make one choice, and that's it! No picking anything else ( for those whom are especially indecisive) but that special one sandwhich. The meats and variations of ingredients inside blended very well, with strong bold flavours.   However for Banh Mi it is very expensive unfortunately.   I was unlucky to get food poisoning from eating their buns, mind you I was starving I scarfed them down anyways so that why I am quite sure it was from them.   The service was a bit lacking and slow. But I will definitely try back again another time so I can hopefully turn this review around for everyone."}
{"text":"Really great take on banh mi, obviously a bit more expensive than traditional banh mi but still so good the extra couple of dollars are worth it. Sometimes the line up can be insane but generally they move through it at a good pace. I've never had to wait more than 20 mins."}
{"text":"When I first walked into the restaurant on Queen St West, I was a little skeptical about the fusion aspect...mostly because I've been scarred by so-called Asian fusion in the Midwest.  It's not straight up Vietnamese food, but it is GOOD! We got the most traditional banh mi (the grilled pork one) and the meat was delicious. The bread was also excellent - probably the best part.  We also tried the pork belly bao which was soft and flavorful. The Kimchi fries with pulled pork was a hit since we all love and crave fries - it's the best comfort food. It was the perfect combination of savory, sour, and fatty. Mmmmmm.   Definitely worth a stop in here for a quick bite. The place fills up quickly and there aren't too many seats so keep in mind that it's not good for big groups! The atmosphere is casual, urban and trendy with murals on the wall and Square."}
{"text":"The tofu fries were out of this world good. Fries covered in a sauce, kimchi, mayo, chives and tofu. It might sound crazy but it is amazing!!"}
{"text":"We listened to the suggestions on Yelp and were not disappointed. My friend and I ordered the Kim Chi fries, the five spice pork belly sandwhich and the pork belly bao. All 3 were delicious and packed with flavours. The Kim Chi fries is a combination that works surprisingly well. If you are someone that isn't too adventurous, you should still try them . Very good food for a very good price"}
{"text":"A little over-hyped if you ask me. *3.5 stars  Don't get me wrong, I liked the food I had here - BBQ pork belly bahn mi and a beef cheek steamed bao, but I suspect that a lot of the \"amazing\" reviews were written by people who aren't experienced in the world of bahn mi.  I'd definitely give the steamed bao two thumbs up, but the bahn mi was merely good and, at $5.99, I'll take three tastier ones in Chinatown instead for the same total price.  There's still plenty of good stuff on the menu that I'd like to try, so hopefully my review update will bring it to a full four stars."}
{"text":"Won't lie best banh mi place I've ever found! Great location but service a tad bit slow. The price is cheap for the size of the banh mi and they really pack in the meat and veggies in there! First time tasting it and I'm definitely coming back for lunch next time I'm in TO! (Ask for some jalapeños on the side gives it a good punch)"}
{"text":"Ordered through foodora.  I had the Club Banh Mi and the Kimchi Fries.   The club banh mi comes with both fried chicken and pork belly, which is a great option if you want to try both types of meats at the same time. The kimchi fries come with pulled pork, mayonnaise, pulled pork, green onion, and regular fries. Both were delicious.  The sandwich itself was already quite a lot of food, and these fries aren't really a side as advertised, but is pretty much a meal on its own, so plan appropriately if you're thinking of getting multiple items.  Wonder how the buns are like."}
{"text":"As good as it gets!  Had their chicken sandwich.. Flavourful and delicious.  Line up was long, but moving quickly.  Took my food to go, as there was not much seating... Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"After my usual and yearly 10km+ Spring Urban Exploration Tour... For real, I do that every Spring, a few friends and I go out there and we re-explore the city.    This year it all started at Yonge and College, meandered through Little Italy to Roncesvalles, then back downtown through Queen and up again from Queen and Yonge to College.   After 12km+ we were starving and decided to drop by this local joint on our way back and oh yes, they are delicious!  There was quite the lineup and the place was utterly full, however we waited for less than 5-6 minutes and those damn pork belly and beef sandwiches really hit the spot.   The food is tasty with a good amount of veggies like carrots and cucumbers, and on top of that they are quite inexpensive and healthy when compared to the quality of other fast food (I am looking you McD's) you would get for the same price or more.  I highly recommend almost every sandwich but do yourself a favour and try the pork belly. You will thank me later.   PRO TIP: Do not go easy on the Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce as it really compliments almost all sandwiches, except for perhaps the beef ones.   PRO TIP #2: On a beautiful sunny day, take your order to go and walk a few minutes Northwest to the AGO/OCAD park and make a mini-picnic of it!"}
{"text":"Delish...go there just for the kimchi fries...1100 calories of tastiness!  It's always busy, due to cheap prices, fast service and amazing food."}
{"text":"I love this place. Friendly, upbeat staff!  My recommendations:  - duck confit banh mi - kimchi fries"}
{"text":"ummm okay been wanting to come here for awhile now and HOLY well worth the wait. I had the beef cheek steamed bao. There was coriander in it, which i HATE but it was fine because I picked it all out.  The beef was kinda sweet like beef jerky you would get from an asian supermarket.  They do not skimp out on the beef at all.  The pickled carrots complemented everything so well.  okay SO onto the important part - the bao.  It is soft, sweet, and smooth like a babys ass.  I wanna go just to order 5 baos to eat plain.    I also shared the kimchi fries.  There's kimchi, pulled pork, green onions and some special mayo on top. Not sure what the mayo is made of but it's amazingg and everything combined together works really well surprisingly.    I'm obsessed with this place and I hafta come back and try all the baos!"}
{"text":"Hands down amazing bao and banh mi.  Tacos were meh. And kimchi fries the fries were soft and not crisp.  Wouldn't order it again but will come again for banh mi and baos"}
{"text":"When you have some money to spare and want to upgrade your already good but too traditional Banh Mi, THIS is the place to go. Come early or be prepared for a long line up."}
{"text":"Amazing place for a quick bite but be aware seating is always difficult to find. Braised beef is my fav but chicken is good as well."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I learned that Bahn Mi Boys had opened up a new location!   At the Queen West location, I had originally tried their kimchi fries and fell in food heaven. This time I tried the five spice pork belly sandwich. This was delicious. The pork belly was nicely spiced and had great flavour. I also love the radish, cucumber, and pickled carrots they put in the sandwich, it adds a nice crunchy element. I asked for extra spicy, which added a nice kick to the sandwich.  I'm already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"On the corner of Queen and Spadina, it was only a 15 minute walk from where I was staying so I wanted to walk over for a quick bite. I thought I would avoid a line or any sort of a lunch rush going around 2-3pm but I still had to wait about 15 min.  I wanted to try a variety so I opted for the Grilled Pork Banh Mi, Kimchi Fries, and the Five Spice Pork Belly Bao. Everything was good and quite decent but my favorite actually turned out to come from the one I was least expecting - the Pork Belly Bao. What a pleasant surprise. The bun was larger than the usual bao and really soft. The pickled vegetables were just right and still crunch and worked well with the accompanying sauces.  The Grilled Pork Banh Mi was okay. The bread was a bit too hard for me but nothing stood out of the ordinary. I would say to opt for a cheaper and better banh mi elsewhere.  The Kimchi Fries is a good idea but the execution wasn't quite there. I found the balance to be too sweet, which stemmed from the fries being seasoned that way. They tasted like cajun fries or almost like the BBQ flavor on chips, which I'm guessing comes from five spice. I think it would have worked better just being unseasoned fries because there's already a lot going on with the kimchi and the pulled pork. The mayo is needed to mellow out the flavors but it didn't do enough. I actually threw in some avocado I had at home and that really brought the dish together. The Boys should really think to add that to the fries because that's what would really make this dish an amazing one."}
{"text":"The pork belly is a must have. The acidity in the pickled vegetables cuts right through the rich and fatness of the pork creating a perfect flavor and texture explosion. The beef cheeks for the bao is better served on a baguette or a taco. The fried chicken boa is done with white meat yet still remained juicy as ever.  Best sandwich shop in the city for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Good quality food, great value, friendly service, clean restaurant.  This place has it all.  I had the kalbi banh mi and it was delicious.  Good amount of meat, and veggies were fresh.  My son had 2 spiced pork belly baos and he loved them.  Was fun watching him spit out the cilantro - it was his first time tasting it and didn't know what it was.  I take nothing away from the restaurant though as I'm not sure cilantro is universally loved by kids.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Frick. Years later and I'm still loving these sandwiches and bao The fried chicken bao is sooooooo good. And the price hasn't even really gone up in this entire time they've been open- minimal inflation, still delicious product. I like how they don't do a basic cold cut so it's not like this place outshines regular 2$ viet banh mi places- it's just a really good supplement.  I have to say though, they really need to get on cleaning the place more often- it gets filthy here. Tables are full of crumbs and food droppings, sauces, etc. even the seats are dirty sometimes. I get that when it's busy all staff are dedicated to the lineup. But perhaps provide some cleaning solution, wet wipes and large paper towel so people can clean up the tables themselves? I've also seen people liberally throw napkins and stuff on the ground and not care to pick it up. Like the girl beside me today cleaned the table with a napkin, but then just pushed all the food to the floor and then tossed the napkin on the ground too. Stop being filthy, people- that behaviour wouldn't even be acceptable in a foodcourt ."}
{"text":"I loved everything about it! I got the kimchi fries and the Pork belly banh mi and they were both delicious. The place has limited seating but the atmosphere was great, especially since they were playing great 90's hip hop music."}
{"text":"Normally I hate sandwiches, especially Banh Mis when I see them at the grocery store sold in refrigeration.  Bahn Mi Boys has definitely opened my eyes to the world of this great sandwich which was inventive and heavily delicious.  Ordered the kalbi bahn mi with kimchi fries and made the huge mistake of sharing it with three other people.  The sandwiches are properly portioned for one person.  Crispy, not soggy bun with the true meatiness inside the sandwich which collides with the pickled vegetables, the sandwich comes together in a perfect symphony of flavours.   The kimchi fries are also a standout.  It's unique take on a poutine, it's tossed with mayo, scallions, pulled pork (but not the typical pulled pork, more like the Korean BBQ flavor, which was ingenious) and sriracha. Recommended to anyone who enjoys Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the pork belly banh mi and kimchi fries. Both were awesome. I've had banh mi at a couple other places in TO but BMB does it best.The only complaint here is the hours of operation....they close relatively early on weekend nights and I have made the trip there a couple of times only to not make it before closing. If they were open later I would give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place isn't the largest restaurant - it's better catered to the takeout crowd. However when you walk in there are 4-5 tables and you walk straight to the back where there is the desk and kitchen to order.   I've never had their Banh Mi's because their Baos are so good. I was turned on to them once and never had anything else since. My favourite is the Pork Belly, it's just so soft and it has to be the most popular but the Fried Chicken and the Pablo Tofu are also delicious. I've never had the Beef or the Pulled Pork but I imagine that would be delicious as well, they'd be the next on my list.   The service is quick, they ask you for your spice levels which are reasonably standard - no varying spice levels, I think they nailed it when they say hot is hot and mild is mild. If you can get a table then grab it and hold on to it, but they turn people over so quickly that it shouldn't be long for a table to open up. 5 stars, I just need to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here, and kudos to them for putting out quality food for a good price and for how busy they are. I had a spicy pork belly sandwich, and there's nothing to criticize negatively about it since the bun was fresh, a nice homemade spicy mayo, well seasoned and perfectly meat/fat balance pork belly, and pickled veggies. Will certainly come back when in the area and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys always deliver great sandwiches! Their five spice pork belly is my favourite, but I'd also recommend the grilled chicken, lemongrass tofu and fried chicken bao. The sandwiches are small, but reasonably priced, packed with great flavours! Your choice of spice level is available.   The service is fast and friendly, even when they're swamped with orders, which is almost always. The space is small, but I always seem to find a place to eat and run.  I'd recommend them if you're in the area and in need of a cheap, fast, good eat!"}
{"text":"I really like this location. My favourite is the secret menu bao.  Staff is always nice, and the keep the place clean.  Food is ready pretty fast.  Cheap, fast, simple and delicious!"}
{"text":"Kimchi fries-not a poutine since there's no cheese and no gravy-turned out to be quite palatable. The combination of mayo-kimchi-green onion isn't half as bad as it sounds, in fact the flavours worked quite well together if only on the more salty side. The pulled pork was really good and they were generous with it. The Kimchi Fries ($5.99) are listed as a side dish but the portion's large enough to be a meal on its own. The line started at the door but there was remarkable efficiency behind the counter. While waiting for the food you ordered, you can see the Banh Mi Boys at work, similar to Five Guys. Finally, I learned that in Toronto there's no shame sitting in an open spot at someone else's table."}
{"text":"Skip the Banh Mi and go for the steamed Bao and Kimchi Fries!   The Banh Mi are good - but so are the $2 Banh Mi you get at Spadina and Dundas"}
{"text":"Delicious food. I especially like the Bao and the Banh Mi. The fries are decent, as are the kimchi fries, but neither one really stands out for me, and I'd probably always pick a bao over a taco.  They are busy during most mealtimes, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"This place is many people's favourite, thus the line up is usually long but the service is fast and the food is amazing! Simple and delicious, great for take out."}
{"text":"the kim chi fries, tho.  I'm not even that into kim chi.  They're so good, I'm gonna go dream about them.  Service is pretty quick. Loud to sit there at lunch, though. The layout's not really good."}
{"text":"Quick, easy, and affordable snack just an intersection north of Yonge and Dundas Square/Ryerson. The bao was soft and plump, the braised beef was flavorful and tender, and the carrots added a nice crunch to the overall texture. At $3.50, it's a considerable option for a fast and tasty treat but don't expect to get full from just one."}
{"text":"I just can't say enough good things about this place. I have travelled from Vaughan by subway just to eat the pork banh mi and go back up. I don't know how they marinate the meat but it is beyond perfection. The fresh veg in the sandwich adds a new dimension to food as I have ever known it. I want to put raw carrots on everything now. It's never as good as banh mi boys. I have considered working here just to learn the meat recipe. 10 stars*"}
{"text":"Third time trying Banh Mi Boys and this time through the Foodora app.  Ordered two 5-spice pork belly banh mi, a kalbi beef banh mi, three 5-spice pork belly bao and a sweet potato kimchi fries.  Delivery fee was down to $3.50 with a larger order.  Estimated delivery time was 1/2 hr. and it was on time, impressive!  Pork belly anything is highly recommended - so juicy, moist and tender.  Kimchi fries come in a sizeable portion and are a definite share.  We would order again!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this a try after the numerous rave reviews I've heard these past few years.  Opted for a takeout order of grilled chicken banh mi, pulled pork banh mi, pulled pork steamed bao and kim chi fries.  As a disclaimer, it was all eaten about an hour after a walk outdoors so def not the optimal sampling.  The banh mi is very sizeable, although makes sense for its $5-6 range.  I love the loaded pickles carrots, always a banh mi fav.  Grilled chicken banh mi was surprisingly very moist and flavourful.  Pulled pork banh mi was a disappointment, all samplers agreed it was dry and in need of some extra sauce.  Pulled pork steamed bao was ok, nothing special; I've had it before when they were at the CNE Food Building.  After hearing the most about the infamous kim chi fries, it was just...mediocre.  Kim chi tang was a nice twist, pulled pork was not as dry as in the banh mi but it was a bit too salty for my liking.  Again, eaten not at its prime so cool and softer fries was a bit of a damper.  Overall, cool Asian fusion concept.  I can see the appeal.  I think I prefer the classic spin on the banh mi but def nice to try!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place but I gotta give it a 1 star this time for the \"service rating\" because I found the service is terrible, especially the lady at the cashier with multiple piercings on her face. I order \"bao with fried chicken and pork belly together at the same bao\" (apparently this is on secret menu, and this is what I had when my friend brought me here last time). The cashier lady put it as 2 separate baos in the order. I realized it when I saw the receipts. I told her I wanted one bao with fried chicken and pork belly together. She replied me with \" I repeated back to you while ordering and you confirmed it. YOU SHOULD PAY ATTENTION.\" And again she repeated \"YOU SHOULD PAY ATTENTION NEXT TIME!!!\"  Excuse me, I did pay attention to my order, but all I heard was \" Bao with fried chicken and pork belly\". Of course I said YES to my order. She said she read back to me that I order \"2 Baos with fried chicken and pork belly\". To my defense, if she showed me 2 with her fingers while repeating my order back to me, I would have caught that. Just like all conversations, we only hear the \"key words-bao, fried chicken and pork belly\", especially she did not emphasize 2 while speaking.  Anyhow, she went back to the back office to speak to the manager and came back to tell me that \" we will do it for you this time, but next time YOU NEED TO PAY ATTENTION\". I should feel grateful that they are WILLING to put fried chicken and pork belly at the same bao for me. How about the price? I confronted her again \" isn't there a difference in price for these two orders?\" She seems angry and went back to her manager again. After disappearing for 2 mins, the manager came out and said to me \" we normally don't do refund once orders are in. You ordered 2 baos so that's what we put it in\". I repeated that I did not hear she said 2 baos. In fact, it is the cashier's fault that she didn't PAY ATTENTION TO MY ORDER. The manager taught me that next time I should order \"club bao\" but not fried chicken and pork belly at the same bao. Hello!! Since club bao is the secret manu, who would know the name? The Manager did end up refunding me the money by asking the cashier lady to give me back the difference. I swear she did not seem happy. I think I will never walk into this place again. I don't even care about the money they refunded me or not.  It is the fact that I needed to fight for what I ordered. The cashier refused to do so right from the start by lecturing me that I did not pay attention to her so I need to take the order she put in. On top of that the cashier did not acknowledge that there is price difference when they clearly know so.  There was not even subtle signs of smile on cashier's face the whole time.  I would have accepted the whole situation if the cashier simply said \" Sorry, there must be misunderstanding. The order is in so there will be no refund but we will make your order for you\". Customer service is nowhere to be seen among the staff at this place. Never, never again for me!"}
{"text":"Probably the best vietnamese sandwich I've ever had! I ordered the 5 spice pork belly banh mi, and it was extraordinarily good! The pork was juicy & nicely seasoned, the pickles was amazing, and the dressing was spot on. Will definitely come back and try other stuff."}
{"text":"Many people have recommended this place to me. The store was very crowded with a line and very few seats. The food is.....an interesting mix of flavors that I can't really describe, but if you enjoy American food with an Asian twist then this might be for you. Kimchi fries were good, the sandwich and buns however were not as flavorful. Most vegetables used were pickled....which I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"Tastey sandwiches here.  Take the traditional Vietnamese bahn mi sandwich, replace the meat with your choice of pork belly, chicken, lemon grass tofu, roast duck, kalbi BBQ, Kim chee, top with shredded carrots.Your choice of heat: none, medium, spicy or extra hot.  Available sides are: fries, sweet potato fries, tofu fries, kim chee fries.  Drinks: regular soda's, specialty drinks like coconut water, mango, Canada dry, berry soda's.  Décor: minimal.  Customer service: fine."}
{"text":"I am going to rate this place a 3.5 out of 5. I tried the 5 Spice Pork Banh Mi and the Kimchi Fries as fellow Yelpers had recommended. Quite flavourful and a nice change to the usual banh mi i would get if I were in Chinatown. The kimchi fries definitely held a lot more flavour than the okonomiyaki fries which I like ordering from Shiso Tree, which was great. And I'm a pulled pork lover so I'm glad there was a good portion in this unique dish. I'm left super thirsty after my meal... but I would still recommend that everyone try this place for themselves!"}
{"text":"Yummy.  Hits the spot.  The servings look small but they are flavourful and tasty.  Eat it slowly and you will be full.  I had the five spice pork belly bao and the Kalbi beef taco.  Superlative.  The pork belly was so juicy and delicious, oozing out of the soft and yielding bao complemented by crunchy slaw.  The Kalbi beef taco was meaty and just plain orgasmic.  You think you can eat a million of these but if you slow down and chew it thoughtfully you will realized it is packed with flavour and filling and the right amount of spice.  For under $10 I am full and belly happy.  Service is quick and does not compromise on quality so I am cool if they are not the friendliest people.  Next time I am craving I will come back here again."}
{"text":"Ooh, I'm quite impressed! Decided to finally go after seeing so many good reviews and they did not disappoint! Had the 5 spice pork belly banh mi. I have never had a banh mi sandwich so I can't compare it to others, but for a sandwich in general, it was awesome! When I opened the bag and saw the bun, I was worried that it was going to be hard and crusty, and to my delight it was so soft and delicious! I then saw the carrots and got a little worried because I'm not a big fan of carrots, but they were pickled and tasted delicious as well! All the flavours went really really well together and I enjoyed the sandwich greatly.  It doesn't cost much more than a McDonald's meal and probably a lot more healthy... a great lunch option for on the go!"}
{"text":"Tried their pork belly and pulled pork bao--omg I'm in love! So flavourful and less than 4$? Insane."}
{"text":"Was meandering around China Town last evening when I decided to try out Bahn Mi Boys. Yes embarrassingly, I had not tried this spot out yet. I am glad I came here on a weekend when it was less busy rather than a weekday where I have seen the line be impenetrable.  I went in at about 8 pm (closes a 9) and was welcomed by an interestingly casual set up. communal bench seating, super messy, floors and tables. Not sure if they have staff attend to that or if staff is only confined to the prep/serve/cash area behind the counter. Anyways this is what goes with cult classics like Bahn Mi boys, so I didn't think much of it.   I ordered:  1 squid taco for veggie boy 1 panko fish bao for veggie boy 1 fried chicken bao 1 pulled pork bao  The ordering experience was easy enough. There is a screen with options. Although they do not offer much, what they do offer they do well.  They take plastic, which works wonders for me. However - there becomes the disconnect with keeping the restaurant high tech (or standard tech?) in the ordering area, yet totally unkept and lack of cleanliness in the dining area. I know this is a casual  take out spot, but because of its popularity I thought it would be better attended to. It is akin to a hole in the wall in terms of location and venue, but exceedingly clean when it comes to the service counter and its process.    I think the soft bao and the fried chicken was insanely huge and tasty and fresh. The pork bao was Delicious. The veggie boy said it was great, but later confessed it was okay.  Personally the bao here is superior to momofuku's bao :(  I loved it here and will definitely return here, but most likely to the yonge street location which I have seen which is closer to my office.  Price is at par with what you get. By the time I left the line up was almost out the door. With this location I would say a lot of people going out for the evening to a douchey king st club would come here first for cheap eats.  I left here with lipstick all over my face, because these bao's are huge. beware:)"}
{"text":"great food . Love that kimchi fires. Big portion, always line up, but it is worth to wait"}
{"text":"Okay. It's about time to write a review on this place. I've been coming here since it opened and have to admit that the quality has been slowly been going down for me. When they first opened, it was fantastic.  First off, the fries have been a disappointment as of late. The kimchi fries has been tasting less and less fresh. Just trying the fries themselves, they seem over cooked and tasteless. I stopped ordering them.  I stop getting the kalbi since the meat is not cooked properly and very chewy. I can tell that they are using a less quality meat now. I switched to squid and they were wonderfully cooked before but now they are over cooked and chewy. There is nothing wrong with the fresh veggie toppings but wished the protein were cooked properly.  They really need to clean the garbage area. The trash is obviously not working with the small shaped opening and it needs to have a flap or cover. There are all these small insects flying around and has become a nuisance during the warmer weather.  I used to rave about this place to friends but now it's not even someplace I would recommend. Try the burger joints across the street or even McDonald's by the corner."}
{"text":"Fresh and good. Would get 4 stars if they weren't so overpriced. Had the kalbi short rib. Would be better with a leaner cut. Ate lots of fat which was not appetizing"}
{"text":"I work at downtown and I have one hour for lunch.  I came in here around 1 pm and the line up was crazy. Anyway I waited in line for about 10-13 minutes and they took my order. I ordered a 5 Spice Pork Belly Bao and Kimchi Fries.   I received my order in less than 15 minutes. OMG, I LOVED THE BAO! The pork was seasoned beautifully and the actual steamed bun is not too soggy. As for the Kimchi fries, they were still delicious however, they placed the box sideways (as I ordered it for to go) and when I opened it, the sauce was dripping on the side and everything was all mixed up. The flavours were still pretty awesome though.   Will definitely be back to try other options. As for time, I had 30 mins remaining to enjoy both dishes and it was HEAVEN!"}
{"text":"Braised beef is giving me wet dreams! The kimchee sweet potato fries are more addictive then crack! I'm serious I would sell my dad to the taliban for another batch of sweet potato fries"}
{"text":"Kimchi fries are amazing (when fresh.....I did get it once and the fries were pretty mad soggy.) The pork belly baos and kalbi tacos are also my favorite to get there!"}
{"text":"I have to preface this by saying I've only had a banh mi once (made of headcheese - it was awesome) before going here. I am by no means a good judge of how \"authentic\" anything about the food was and I know this is fusion food not intending to adhere strictly to tradition (though a banh mi in and of itself is a fusion of Asian and French cuisine so...). I am rating this strictly on how good the food and my experience were, not how it stacks up to other banh mi or traditional Vietnamese cuisine in general.   The good: I got a duck confit banh mi - I've been CRAZY for the duck lately; see my review of Prince BBQ - and it was just amazing. It was just fatty enough to give that hearty, comfort food flavor and texture without being greasy. It was well trimmed (one ittttttttty bitty piece of grissle in the whole sandwich), and the roll & pickled vegetables were fresh and tasty. I also sampled my bf's grilled pork banh mi - great, but the duck was better - and he raved about the chicken taco he got. Personally my banh mi and a sampling of my friend's amazing kim chi fries (holy poo - huge serving and such a great mix of flavors and textures; I could just sit and eat a box of these without ordering anything else and be totally satisfied) was more than enough for me. They call you over to the prep section of the line to order the \"zestiness\" you want individually - unprepared I stammered \"uhhh mild-mediumish...?\" She totally nailed it. Just the right amount of seasoning and sriracha.   The meh: I'd actually give the place a 4.5. A few very minor complaints if I'm going to get fussy -    1) A bit disappointed with the drink selection for a place with such interesting fusion cuisine, though they did have some glass bottled sodas. I was especially wanting something hot with the crazy cold weather and they only have bottled, cold beverages.   2) The awkward counter stuffed next to the trash cans is a bit weird. Maybe rearrange some stuff? Probably not going to happen with such a small location and a minor complaint overall.  3) Staff was fairly curt, but they were uber busy. Seemed to notice some employees being a lot more friendly with Asian than non-Asian customers (not just muah, but I've had Asian friends treated like crap generally by white people so that could play into someone's perceptions), but no one screamed \"you can't have a sandwich honkey,\" so maybe I was reading into things or they get regular customers they recognize. I know the people at my favorite pizza place treat me like a celebrity when I come in and then will be blunt as h e double hockey sticks with the people behind me they don't know.   4) I have to say, over $7 for a relatively small hoagie is a bit steep, but meh, it's duck and I was impressed with the quality of the ingredients.   I would DEFINITELY go back, and would love to see one of these open in Buffalo, which is practically a banh mi wasteland."}
{"text":"must try: kimchi fries secret menu: club bao"}
{"text":"Thought this place was only ok. The subs here are not that authentic, and there are all sorts of delicious banh mi out there that taste better!"}
{"text":"This place is overrated and overpriced. You can get banh mi for several dollars cheaper at Chinatown. Their kimchi fries are so-so. You can probably make it yourself at home with fries, kimchi, and a couple of other toppings. Seating is very limited, so don't plan your visit expecting to have a seat. It also gets quite cramped/crowded during peak hours because there will be a long line. People who dine in will probably feel claustrophobic as it's hard to get in and out of your seat when there are a ton of people waiting in line."}
{"text":"This place is good value for money, and delicious. I definitely prefer some menu items over others.  One of my favourites here is the kalbi beef taco. It's a scrumptious medley of flavours. The bahn mi sandwiches are also awesome - esp the five spice pork and braised beef cheek. Have yet to try a bunch of their other meat/filling options though.   Most recently tried the duck confit bahn mi and the squid taco. Squid taco was pretty much calamari in a taco. I would've preferred if it wasn't deep fried. Duck was good too, but wouldn't be my top choice.  Kimchi fries are yummy - they're quite saucy from what I recall."}
{"text":"My cousin who lives in Toronto took me here for lunch the other day while I'm in Toronto visiting. I had a kalbi banh mi and a steamed pork belly bao. Of course I've had 50 cent banh mis in Vietnam that blew this away including the one in Hoi An where Anthony Bourdain recommended but this is pretty good for a modern place for people who are in the Queen West area. I won't hate. It's tasty."}
{"text":"Usually I hate what is called \"Fusion\" Food, but this place combines the absolute best parts of different Asian cuisines, in a fast, unpretentious and completely delicious way. Went here randomly one day, and I was SO impressed by that pork belly bao, deliciously spiced and salty and complimented perfectly by the slice of pickled radish. Will definitely come back!! :D"}
{"text":"The Kimchee Fries was the best thing I ate on my Toronto vacation. I was skeptical because the different ingredients didn't sound like they would go together and I'm not a huge fan of french fries to begin with (except for McDonalds fries), but I was pleasantly surprised!  I also ordered a Chicken Banh Mi. It was good, but not the best I've had. It was a little bit skimpy on the fillings."}
{"text":"So happy to discover that Banh Mi Boys is veg-friendly! There is a tofu option for banh mi, Korean taco and bao. Being a fan of the fluffy white buns, the bao is my go-to. The combination of panko crusted tofu and sliced veggies in a fluffy bun makes for a satisfying snack. Their sweet potato fries are thin, crispy, well-portioned and basically a steal at $3.25. This is fusion fast food I can get behind!"}
{"text":"I really just can't get enough of Banh Mi Boys. I used to love the tacos and kimchi fries, but then I discovered the club bao (it's a secret item, not on the advertised menu).  Now I'm really hooked. Definitely recommend if you like quick, delicious and spicy."}
{"text":"I would say I'm sorry If I thought that it would change your mind But I know that this time I have said too much Been too unkind  I try to laugh about it Cover it all up with lies I try and laugh about it Hiding the tears in my eyes Because Banh Mi boys don't cry Banh Mi Boys don't cry  ---------------  It's not too often that hyped up places meet expectations, but this place is as good as everyone says it is.  Our group of 4 almost ordered one of everything in various combinations and we didn't encounter anything we didn't like.  Kimchi pulled pork fries, beef cheek tacos, kalbi Banh Mi, Pork Belly Banh Mi, Calamari baos.  All yummerooos."}
{"text":"Oh my good , since the first time I come back each week at least once . So nice , delicious , you really don't know what to order cuz all dat is so good"}
{"text":"I got the pork belly banh mi and it was delicious!! Love their kim chi fries too."}
{"text":"We made a stop at Banh Mi Boys during our Toronto road trip this past weekend and left extremely disappointed!  We arrived around 7ish and the place was packed. There was about 10 people ahead of us but the line moved fairly quickly. This location is fairly small and narrow, with just a slew of tables on the left and the register towards the back. The selection of banh mi, tacos steamed baos, and a couple of random sides are listed on a huge tv screen directly above the cashier. The protein choices include the standard grilled pork, chicken and meatball but also some more gourmet options such as braised beef cheek, duck confit, squid, etc. plus a vegetarian option (tofu). The squid sounded interesting and different but I decided to stick with the classic pork in order to make a comparison to my favorite banh mi spot(Ba Xuyen in NYC!)   The banh mi was underwhelming to say the least. The baguette was not even toasted! It was soft and too chewy. There was a ton of the standard carrots, daikon, cucumber and cilantro on top but so little of the pork -- maybe two or three crumbles of it per bite. Why so skimpy?! Without the toasty baguette, the texture was so off too, since the veggies were quite crunchy but the bread soo thick and doughy...booo.  Banh Mi Boys cannot even compare to my beloved Ba Xuyen.  Not even close. (I went to Ba Xuyen the day I got back to get my fix)."}
{"text":"Reading all the hype on Yelp definitely put Banh Mi boys on my list of places to try asap - as did the fact that I've never had a banh mi before.  So when I was meeting my sweetie for some Christmas-themed mushiness at Underground Cinema (in the form of Love Actually on the big screen), I was happy to be reminded that the two are very close.    It's fairly non-descript from outside - my guy admitted that he probably wouldn't have given it a chance without my recommendation.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted by three things - the warmth of the grill, the guy staffing the grill, and a menu board.  We quickly made our selections of pulled pork and pork belly, and they were cooked fresh in front of us.  The cook also topped our sandwiches, and was nice enough to make suggestions for the two banh mi virgins in front of him.  I topped my pork belly with pickled carrots, cilantro, kimchi, hot peppers, mayo and lucky sauce.  It was delicious!  Even the bun was great.  The SO and I were both impressed.  For the same price, you could go to Subway - but if you have this as an option, why would you?  Quality meat with interesting flavours and toppings, or blah lunchmeat with your regular toppings on a crappy bun?  Not much of a contest.    As far as atmosphere, there wasn't a lot, but a place like this is for a quick bite not a romantic evening.  For around $5 you can have a filling sandwich prepared fresh, and sit to eat it if you want to.  Considering street meat isn't that much cheaper, I'd say that's a good deal.  I wish there was one closer to me!    All in all, this is amazing value.  A super tasty hot sandwich for a great price, and friendly service.  I'll be recommending to all my friends, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys specializes in Vietnamese style sandwiches. Unfortunately, they don't have any gluten-free alternatives for their sandwich bread. Even their tacos shells are wheat flour based. So I opted for the kimchi fries instead.  These were truly amazing! Smothered in flavorful shredded pork, gooey cheese, chopped green onions and sour kimchi. If you're craving loaded fries, this is the way to go. The perfect balance of flavors and textures: messy, salty and fresh. Don't forget to grab a fork if you're taking it to go.  Give them a try for lunch!"}
{"text":"I don't know which location was actually first (Yonge or Queen) but that doesn't really matter.  I've been to the Yonge location a bunch of times and I've never been disappointed in anything I've ever tried from BMB.  This location is near the north west corner of Queen and Spadina.  This location looks to be about the same size give or take but while the setup seems similar such as the main tables being on the left side upon entry and the orders being queued to the left of the cash counter there's actually a couple stools near the front counter and a narrow stand up counter beside the drink fridges.  The set up is basically still the same though.  You order at the cash, you pay, you wait on the left side.  That or you can order via email or user Foodora to pickups and delivery.  I mean the menu hasn't really changed much through out the time since they've been around but still they're something of a phenomenon.  When you can attract the likes of Alton Brown to your establishment you've peaked interest.    Kalbi tacos, kimchi fries, fried chicken bao and so on.  Your closer to traditional bahn mi pork sandwiches... yes they have something like that too.  Choose if you want sriracha or jalapenos or habaneros.  That's your choice of how hot you can make it.    The veggies are cold and crisp and the meat is hot and steamy.  I love that combo of hot and cold at the same time.  Add the dimension of spice and/or sweet and it becomes more complicated for something that looks so simple.  I love their fried chicken baos.  I've had pretty much a taste of everything on the menu through out time and it's still my favorite of the fried chicken baos around town that I've had.  The meat is white breast meat but it's juicy not hard and dry.  The added mayo and cold crisp veggies make the taste and texture so wonderful for such a nice snack.  4 bucks for these bad boys... not a bad deal for a quality type chicken snack you can't get just anywhere.  BMB has a consistent quality across both locations as far as their fried chicken baos are concerned.  I've only been to the Queen location once."}
{"text":"***1/2 stars  I remember when we were kids in the 80's and 90's when there were only 2 Chinatowns - the Broadview/Gerrard one (East Chinatown) and the Dundas/Spadina one (West Chinatown).  But now, there are \"Chinatowns\" all over Toronto and the GTA.  Our weekend routine would be to pile the family into our navy blue Mazda, and make a trip downtown for our Chinese grocery needs.  This meant many hours spent sitting in the car waiting for mom to finish her shopping trip (which sometimes can seem like an eternity).  With grumpy kids in the car, my dad would always take us to Nguyen Huong to pick up a filling banh mi sandwich.  Some twenty odd years later, the banh mi has beeen rejuvenated by brothers David & Phil Chau, who are no strangers to this Vietnamese staple, as their parents own Nguyen Huong.  However, they have re-packaged and upped the ante (and price) with their own takes on gourmet banh mi with choices like duck confit and kalbi beef.  Strategically located at the busy corner of Queen + Spadina, there is no shortage of customers as they pile in and line-ups can go outside the door during peak hours.  The 3 major categories of selections here are: banh mi ($4.99 - $7.49), tacos ($3.99) and baos, which are steamed buns ($3.49).  I have tried all three alongside their unforgettable kimchi fries which I've now dubbed the Asian poutine.  Crispy fries, topped with kimchi cabbage, mayo, scallions and caramelized pork - I'm thinking of calling the boys up and franchising in the clubbing district where the post-clubbing crowd would just eat it all up.  Watch out Smoke's Poutinerie!  For those of you tater-lovin' fans there are also sweet potato fries and regular fries available.  And those of you who want to eat \"healthy\" can find comfort in their Papaya Jicama Salad ($2.99) in the form of an Asian 'slaw.  You can spice things up with hot sauce, red Thai chilies or jalapenos.  A fridge by the cash register features a variety of unique quaffs such as Henry Weinhard's Root Beer, Pop Shoppe sodas, coconut water, and bottled Coke.  The sugary carbonated drinks available are just as varied as the menu itself.  V E R D I C T  I am totally diggin' the vibe at Banh Mi Boys.  David & Phil have managed to take a classic and sex it up.  With that said, there's still something about ma and pa's banh mi over at Nguyen Huong that is irreplaceable.  The baos are nice and soft but can be messy to handle especially if you're getting it to go (which is more likely than not with the limited seating), as it is not made to withstand the saucy contents of the bao.   My favourite dishes would have to be first and foremost, the Kimchi Fries, followed by the Kalbi Beef Tacos.  The salad was nice and light, but if you take bites of it after eating your mains which are bold in flavour, it will seem blah.  P.S.  David/Phil - I have one small request.  Can we make the doors push on the way out and pull on the way in instead?  When I have a handful of yummies, it's just inconvenient to have to grab the handle ;)"}
{"text":"My pork belly bahn mi was good, solid but not very spicy (I ordered the medium) but the pork belly was grilled to perfection.    It was good but not mind blowing.   The music was really fun and lively with rap, r&b and music from my youth. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I'm just gonna come back here over and over again because it's just that good.  Yo man, where else am I going to find a hearty and cheesy kimchi poutine fries? And what about that melt-in-your-mouth pork belly sandiwch? Only this place will ever satisfy my cravings for these bad boys and I don't care. I'll throw my money at them like I would at a male stripper club.   Okay but seriously, I love this place. During my short time here in Toronto, I've been here the most so far. And I'll keep coming back! In fact, I'm about to bring a cute boy on a date to this place soon...but if he doesn't love Banh Mi Boys like I do, then I think it just wasn't meant to be."}
{"text":"I'm thankful this Banh Mi Boys location exists in an otherwise questionable area for food (\"Should we go to The Big Slice, or this joint with no sign next to an 'adult theatre'? You know what, never mind, I'll just chew on a piece of gum\").  I rarely crave a banh mi, but I'm almost always down with the other options, of which there are plenty. The non-sandwich items are on the small side, so it's appropriate for a snack/light meal. My go-tos are a squid taco ($4, on a fantastic Asian pancake-type soft shell) or a tofu bao ($3.5), and sometimes I'll partake in the tofu fries ($6) if I'm feeling feisty.  Excellent pre/post-AMC stop or to fuel happy thoughts in preparation for a dreaded errand run through the Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"I had foodies request that I try to check out Banh Mi Boys to do an updated visit and review, since I last said I went here before I started this account and hadn't written anything up.. But people wanted to know what I thought; I only remembered my last meal being way too dry at a different spot. While looking for lunch, realized there was a Banh Mi Boys near by and finally stopped in to try and order a Squid Banh Mi. My order not only came out quick and super huge (a lot bigger than I remembered), but steaming hot in a fresh, fluffy, soft bread with an incredibly juicy mix of medium Sriracha heat and mayo beneath the squid. This location served me the best banh mi I ever had, definitely blew my socks off today!   Actually also got a drink, label said it was fruit punch but totally tasted like cream soda 100% hahaha luckily I didn't mind it either way, was a refreshing way to wash down the rest of the food. Today's food adventure was a success!"}
{"text":"Service very efficient and staff are all friendly. More importantly, the food was great! My friends I tried the sweet potato fries (comes with light mayonnaise for dip), and the kimchi fries (interesting taste - it's fries, topped with mayonnaise, and shredded meat)...and it was an experience I tell you (a good one). Also, the price is good for a student budget (between $5-10) although portions for the tacos and baos are a bit small and I wish the portions were bigger for the price (they cost about $3.99). The portion for the baos & tacos aren't filling as a meal but adequate for a snack.   Overall, it's a good place to grab a quick bite - whether you're on the go, or sitting down quickly for a snack break by yourself or with friends, at a budget friendly price. It's not the most healthy option, but it's good on your wallet and hits the spot. I'd suggest it as a place to take a friend or two for a snack+chat."}
{"text":"Heard many people talked about this place, finally tried it. I had the grilled five spice pork belly sandwich for $6.50. Flavor is pretty good. In my books they could give a bit more meat with that price. But you do have the option to double the meet for $2-3.50 more. It is not your traditional Vietnamese Banh mi. Overall not bad if you want to grab something quick and go."}
{"text":"BMB is near my work, so I've tried basically every item on the menu. Favourites: Five Spice Pork Belly (the belly is so fatty and delicious), Squid Taco (the taco is more of an Asian flat-bread taco), Fried Chicken Bao!  There's always a long line no matter what time you go, but it's tasty food for cheaps."}
{"text":"I popped in for a quick bite to eat.  All I wanted was a sandwich to tide me over until dinner time and I knew I wouldn't get full off one sandwich.  I ordered the pork belly which I thought was awesome.  This sandwich reminds me a lot of what McDonald's used to serve years and years ago when styrofoam wasn't a big concern back in the day (McDLT) ... the hot stays hot and the cold stays cold.  What I mean is the veggies are fresh, crisp and cold while the meat is nice and steamy hot so you get this hot and cold going on in your mouth along with the sweet sauce and savory meat.    This sandwich is one big brain tease as well as a treat for the taste buds.  Must do more of the menu in the future... for sure."}
{"text":"I am a Vietnamese girl from Orange County, California who lives in a Vietnamese community and has been eating Vietnamese food all her life. I think by now I know what great Vietnamese food taste like...and yep, this is GREAT Vietnamese food- with a twist.   There is a good selection of items to choose from but I would suggest ordering the five Spice Pork Belly Steamed Bao (mMmMmMm) & Kimchi fries (why didn't I think of this?! )  I'll definitely be coming back here the next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I had heard of this place and tried it not too long ago. Make no mistake, the food was good but I felt there was something lacking. Maybe I felt it was more expensive for what you got or the lineup was too long when I went.   I need to give this place another try as I liked it the first time but not a convert or a big fan as of yet."}
{"text":"I ordered the pork belly sandwich extra spicy and WOW, was it good!  I don't think I'd opt to eat-in as the tables are really close together and there always seems to be a line to the door.  The prices are high, but it's the best bahn mi sandwich I ever had!"}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB!!! It is also a must have for anyone visiting Toronto.   You can't go wrong with the kimchi fries and any of the banh mi's. Every serving is flavourful and fills your stomach with ever lasting goodness. The price is also not overly expensive. But do be prepared for small line ups during rush hours."}
{"text":"Banh dat....  I stopped by here over the weekend with a friend. It was my first time here and will probably be the last. I'm not too sure why this place is so popular when their sandwiches are pretty tasteless. We ordered the duck confit banh mi, kimchi fries, fried chicken and five spice pork belly bao.  1/5 Duck Confit Banh Mi - it was overloaded with the pickled carrots, radish and cilantro I didn't even taste the duck. Plus, the bread was pretty stale.   2/5 Kimchi Fries  - the fries were burnt. No amount of mayo, kimchi and meat would've saved this. It was literally like eating coal.   2/5 Fried Chicken Bao - very greasy, lacked in flavour, the bao was super thick which overpowered the taste of the chicken  4/5 Five Spice Pork Belly - delicious! The only thing I enjoyed here. The pork belly was nicely marinated and seasoned. Wishing it was more tender but loved the flavour nonetheless.  What I appreciated about the place was the murals on the wall. Very creative and super vibrant. The service was good too, the food came pretty quick.  But overall, I would not recommend this place at all. There are a ton more Vietnamese restaurants that serve authentic banh mi - this, is not one of them."}
{"text":"3.5/5  I came here mostly wanting to taste the hype.  Kimchi fries - it was delicious and new. Wouldn't have thought of putting this combo together. The tanginess of the kimchi and the sweetness of the pulled pork is like a party in my mouth. However, it could use more kimchi in the fries, my manfriend said it might as well be called pulled pork fries for the lack of kimchi. But because Bahn Mi Boys is more of an asian fusion restaurant, they have to name it kimchi fries for exotic reasons.  Braised Beef Cheek Steam Bao - I like that its called Bao for the name and not bun for authentic reasons. the cheeks were so tender and seasoned just right. for 3.49 it was worth a tiny snack.   Kalbi Beef Taco - Since the steamed bun was called bao, i really was anticipating an actual taco, but instead it came in a chinese pancake. The Kalbi was delicious but there were not a lot so i couldnt taste it until the 3rd bite.   Overall the food was good but nothing to write home about. 3.5 star because the food was not hot even though the restaurant was food court style, with us waiting by the counter for the freshly made food. The seating is limited and the restaurant is cramped. We paid 16$ with tax."}
{"text":"It's place like Banh Mi Boys that make me love going on vacation just so I can eat and eat some more.   I came here with my best friend on a Tuesday morning at 11:15ish. We were in the middle of our food tour of Toronto, so we were slightly full. We decided to split a 5 Spice Pork Belly Banh Mi. It was fairly cheap for a sandwich that size. You get to choose the level of spiciness. I got medium, which they just put Sriracha on it. The sandwich was a perfect size and super fresh. The flavors were AMAZING. The pork belly was a thick cut as well, my friend and I were super happy. Service was spot on, super polite and efficient. The cute guy making my sandwich was friendly and patient when we were deciding what level of spiciness we wanted.  I had a chance to go to Mean Bao as well, and it just doesn't compare to Banh Mi Boys. I would pick this place over Mean Bao any day. I wish they had a Banh Mi Boys in Virginia. I would legit be there weekly. Next time I'm in the area, I'll definitely be back to try one of their baos!"}
{"text":"Came to TO from ottawa. Found this place with google for best food.  It is actualky best  vietnamese sub in east coast.. cant beat calgary viet sub. Sorry.  First time ever try kimchi fries has I normally hate kimchi. But those fired are delicious but be ready to smell kimchi in your mouth all day.  Would go back for sure 100% recommend it"}
{"text":"Good place! The food is very good and the service is fast even thought they have a lot of traffic. Should have more sitting space."}
{"text":"Yum. I think the first time I tried a traditional banh mi here, I wasn't that impressed. Something about the ratio between the heavy dry bread and juicy goodness inside, wasn't working. This time I tried a pork belly bao. The bao lets you really taste the flavour of the fillings inside - it was good but not mind blowing.  This small bao, with a shared kimchi fries was an excellent lunch, but digested in my stomach for the next 2 hours. It was heavy, but worth it.   It was mildly busy on a Monday at lunch time at this location. A bit more accessible than there other one, I thought there would be more people. A bit before 12pm we snagged a table and sort of over stayed our welcome chatting.   Would come back for a quick bit if in the area for sure."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent every time.  Favourite is the grilled chicken although the pork belly is equally as delicious.  The only one that I wasn't thrilled with was the calamari--the rings were very thin and lost in the sandwich.  I have only used them for take out as the dining in experience doesn't appeal to me."}
{"text":"Update: I first reviewed Banh Mi Boys on December 19, 2011. Shortly after they closed for a couple of months to renovate. The place has been completely redone. It looks fantastic and the food is better than ever with an expanded menu. For those who don't eat meat - or don't feel like eating meat that day - they do have non-meat options.  Kudos to the Banh Mi Boys brothers!"}
{"text":"So delish.   I keep coming back because the food is delicious and doesn't make me feel like shit after.   My only wish is that they would make their tacos with corn tortillas (instead of wheat tortillas).  Get there early, the lines are ridiculous."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is without a doubt my favourite sandwich shop in Toronto. I LOVE the chicken banh mi and they use Thai red chilies, which gives the sandwich that extra kick.   The chicken banh mi is simple and delicious. It comes on a baguette with cilantro, carrots, mayo (which tastes more like teriyaki sauce), and cucumber. You can let them know how spicy you would like it. For $6 for a large sandwich, I definitely think it's worth it.   The cashier is always so friendly and will ask how my day is going. I have told my friend and family about Banh Mi Boys and they love it, too! There's a reason this place is always packed."}
{"text":"I really can't say enough good things about Banh Mi Boys, especially now that they've opened a second location that's closer to home. Everything from their fresh, tasty banh mi sandwiches, to their perfectly steamed baos, to their selection of sodas (I don't even drink soda... but vanilla and cherry coke? Where do they even find this stuff anymore?!), I love these restaurants.  My go to? The squid banh mi or the pork steamed bao. So, so tasty. And cheap! You can totally get 2-3 meals worth of food for about $10. Let's be honest though... it'll all be in your belly within the hour.  Open more locations, and continue to please my taste buds. You done good, Boys."}
{"text":"Their pork belly sandwiches are amazing.  If going at lunch, try to get there 10 mins before noon as the line gets quite long at noon from all the office workers nearby."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys has been around for awhile, but this was my first time trying it out. In fact, I hadn't even had a bao until about a month ago! Since then, I've been craving them. So I tried the Fried Chicken Steamed Bao. Which was super yummy and filling. I thought for the price, I wouldn't be getting a lot of substance, but I found the prices to be extremely reasonable for what you get. I enjoyed my bao and I definitely can't wait to try more things off the menu. They have Banh Mi sandwiches and tacos as well as fries. There's not too many seats, but I think at least 10 people can sit and eat in at once. It's great for a quick bite and filling enough to last you for some time."}
{"text":"The place is chaotic like a fast food place at lunch time.  Get over it.  Places like this are why I love visiting T-dot.  If I lived here, I would definitely make it my goal to eat everything on their menu.  The kimchi fries are A-MAAZING.  The pork at the bottom was such a pleasant and unexpected surprise.  After ordering a banh mi and a steamed bun for myself, I felt terrible that I could not do more to help my buddy finish the fries off.  They deserved a better fate than to be tossed into the trash.  No matter, calories had to be allocated elsewhere.  Get the braised beef cheek - do not stop to do anything else or ask any questions.  Banh mi form, steamed bun form, whatever - just get it.  It is soft, tender and super delicious.  It almost put the pork belly I had to shame . . . almost.  I preferred banh mi over steamed bun form only because the steamed bun had cooled to room temperature by the time it got to me (although the contents were still hot).  However, if you want to maximize sampling different things it makes sense to order a number of baos and share them.    GET SOME"}
{"text":"Came here with two of my friends, one of which who really wanted to try this place out (based of the recommendation from her friend). I ordered the lemongrass tofu sandwich and it was really good! I'm generally not a fan of tofu, but in this sandwich it was delicious! The price was also very reasonable. There is minimal seating so we just took our food to go.   I really want to come back here and try the kimchi fries, based on what I read on yelp, I regret not getting them!"}
{"text":"After hearing so many good things about the place, I stopped by for the first time.  I had the Grilled Pork banh mi and shared an order of sweet potato fries. For those familiar with the original Vietnamese sandwiches then you'd know the bun is stuffed with the usual - mayo spread, radishes, carrots and cucumbers.  The Grilled Pork banh mi and sweet potato fries were good but nothing out of this world.  I think I would try the steamed baos and kimchi fries next time when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"5 stars is too little to give this place!! I've been coming here for years and will be coming back for many more! The food is absolutely amazing with the service to match. I cannot recommend this place enough and always recommend it to anyone looking for a good lunch spot or a place for a quick evening bite. I would recommend the grilled pork and pork belly as well as the kimchi fries. Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Interesting twist on the traditional banh mi but I'd still prefer the traditional vietnamese subs.  The sandwiches are on the pricey side.  My favorite here is the kimchi fries. The sandwiches are okay.   This place is worth trying once, not something to eat often."}
{"text":"Wow. Even though BMB is fairly Americanized (or I guess it would technically be Canadian-ized?) for banh mi sandwiches, it's definitely soooo bomb! Great Asian fusion.  I ordered the grilled pork banh mi, kalbi beef taco, and kimchi fries (don't worry, this was shared! haha).   The grilled pork is marinated with lemongrass and placed in a French-influenced Vietnamese style bread with cabbage slaw, pickled carrots, sliced cucumbers, bbq sauce, and mayo. Man, it just hits the spot! It's never too heavy feeling and is satisfyingly filling.   The tacos come with cabbage slaw, kimchi, pickled carrots, and cilantro, all served on a roti bread, which I have never had anything like before! Definitely a brilliant idea.  The kimchi fries... YUM. Crispy fries topped with pulled pork, mayo, kimchi, and green onions. It's absolutely heavenly!   This place gets really packed during dinner time, but their service is fairly fast. Also there's limited seating but people eat and leave fairly quickly as well. The overall look is very modernized and young adult-friendly. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"If you love viet subs, you must come here! This sandwich shop makes gourmet vietnemese sandwiches and other fix-ins that are tasty and filling perfect for a lunch time meal. Not only do they offer sandwiches but they are also known for their baos and kimchi fries. MY favourite menu choices include the kimchi fries, grilled chicken and kalbi beef sandwiches. All of which are filled with lotsa flavour at a very reasonable price! If you come here during lunch, you'll find long lineups to the door but the service is very efficient that you wont have to wait more than 10 minutes. Go try this place because you'll find a whole new love other than the traditional viet subs."}
{"text":"Love Banh Mi Boys! Great switch up from the average sandwich. The locations are super quick and accommodating to new customers. The staff are really friendly and ready to suggest new things to try. Wouldn't recommend for anyone who doesn't like pickled flavors but otherwise, this is a must-try in Toronto.  Cheap. Quick. Great food."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Vietnamese subs, I find myself ducking into the tiniest of venues to try spicy pork sandwiches all over the city from the Vietnamese shops in old Chinatown to P-Mall or the now defunct corner shop in the Junction Triangle.  But downtown Toronto has a new game in town with Bahn Mi Boys, the grilled spicy pork sub was delicious but the pork belly ($6) is a NEW GAME ENTIRELY. While more of a sweet spice than a hot spice, you can play it up with the toppings you choose to your liking. A fantastic sandwich and despite people's complaints, the wait really isn't that long for the quality.   The owners and staff are really nice and sweet and will advise you with whatever you choose and the food is so fresh it's fantastic. For a few dollars more, it's worth the price.   I'll give this place a 5 once I've fully  tried the tacos and steamed bao, but for now, it's looking like there's longevity and staying power here. Hopefully they make their rent, it's not the cheapest postal code."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches. Delicious pork sandwiches.  Authentic flavours with modern execution. Really good prices. Can get a great lunch for $10 or under without bev.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Unique flavour. Ordered pork by mistake and they replaced it for free with beef. Very tasty sandwiches"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys ... That's what she said!  First time here. My friend recommended this place. I asked the cashier if they serve anything vegan and she recommended a tofu sandwich and she notified the kitchen staff. Its always appreciated when restaurants do that.  Service was quick and friendly. The sandwich was filling, fresh, and delicious. Comfy seats if you like to dine in. Prices are reasonable. Overall this is a tasty vietnamese fast food joint. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Flavorful // Quick Eats Casual // Filling   Wandered in here after reading some of the reviews definitely a notable spot worth visiting if you're in the mood for Asian and something quick.   Enjoyed the dishes that we tried here. Pork and beef were tasty and the kimchee fries. The papaya salad was fairly large and we over ordered. We were supposed to be restaurant hopping but this place put us into food coma so a walk was needed after!  The Scene: Hip, Asian, Modern Destination Rating: 8 Date Rating: 8 Hob Nob Potential: N/A  Strong Suggestion: Buns are excellent, lots of shopping nearby."}
{"text":"Filthy place, but tasty-ish sandwich, minus the fatty kalbi beef, which I ordered based on feedback here.  The baos seemed like what to order- the banh mi was greasy and heavy"}
{"text":"Love this place. The banh mi is so good. The bread always has a nice crunch to the outside and the inside is always soft. The flavours are great in the sandwich. The grilled pork is my favourite.  I think their sweet potato fries are among my top rated in Toronto. The kimchi fries are really good too for sharing. I know that Chinatown is just up the street and sells super cheap banh mi but I still love this place. Find it doesn't quite compare and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"Obviously York University students (and Seneca @ York students) are in for a treat!! This delicious sandwich shop opened up on York University Campus! I tried it today! There's no reason for me head to DT Toronto anymore. If you have not tried this deliciousness and don't know what it is... okay let me explain. Crispy, fresh toasted baguette stuffed with grilled meat, pickled carrots and reddish, magic moments and happiness. There's something called Kimchi Fries as well and it's different than anything I've had before. It's awesome!! I would show you guys a picture, but I inhaled the food. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Fast service, orders were correct, portions were huge, great price, and a must try."}
{"text":"Very delicious banh mi here. We got the pork belly (spicy) and duck confit banh mi which were both very delicious. I also liked that you could choose your level of spice. The menu has a good number of options and yummy sides. Portion sizes are good; they are generous with the amount of meat inside and the other toppings. Lots of great flavour. Prices are decent for what you're getting (quality and quantity). Service is also quick so definitely a great place to grab a quick bite for takeout. If you plan to sit in it does get quite busy, but still a comfortable and casual place. Definitely would return to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this although I normally despise fusion places. I ordered the grilled pork banh mi, the 5 species bao, and the kimchi fries. Everything was good, but not spectacular. Maybe because of the reviews, I was expecting more. The best part was being able to customized the spice level.  I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This place makes really delicious & unique banh mi. It's also very inexpensive so I definitely recommend it after a day of shopping on Queen Street :)"}
{"text":"How have I lived in Toronto for the past five months without trying Banh Mi Boys?   After my first bite, I was hooked. The 5-spice pork belly bao is to die for! The braised beef bao and pulled pork bao are also amazing. The price is on point at under $4 for a bao sandwich.   I've gone twice this past week, and the days I don't go I dream about the food. Next on my list to try: kimchi fries."}
{"text":"Quite the experience! And, I'd definitely come back again for the Pork Belly Bao. Did somebody say, \"YUM\"?! There's always a line but it moves fairly fast and you'll be chowing down an inexpensive meal in no time! Tried the kimchi fries as well--it was different and steaming hot! Even as a native Korean who is picky with Kimchi, I thoroughly enjoyed the fusion of spiciness and spuds! Ordered another Pork Belly Bao to go for my son but recommend eating hot on the spot; the steamed bun is not as tasty once it gets cold. See tip cuz it gets crazy here!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, I've jumped on the band wagon and I'm digging this place.  I walked quite a distance and this really hit the spot.  Being of Vietnamese descent, I was quite excited even though I knew from others' reviews that these bahn mi were far from the traditional.  Also, I was excited to try the kimchi fries!  My girlfriend and I ordered the 5 spice pork-belly bahn mi and the kimchi fries.  I love how they allow you to choose how hot you want it and over the years I've come to realize that even though I love spicy, it doesn't sit well with me.  Plus I don't like to sweat when I eat so no Thai chillies for me.  The bahn mi - my god, so delicious.  Maybe it's because I love pig fat and when that huge piece of fat hit my tongue... I was in heaven.  Seasoned well, very juicy, went well with the other ingredients (Korean radish, carrots, cucumber, parsley) and the bread was perfect.  Soft on the inside and not too crispy outside.  The Kimchi Fries - The item on the menu that is a must try recommended by everyone.  I'll have to agree and recommend it to everyone too!  Not because it's out of this world but because it's a very unique taste.  Crispy fries that taste delicious on their own, pulled pork that's just to die for, green onions, sweet mayo (though for me I wish the mayo was just a tad less sweet) and of course, kimchi.  The combination was a mixture between sweet and smokey and I enjoyed the kimchi fries, but I think I set my expectations too high and wasn't blown out of this world but they were good and next time I come here I'll most likely get them again.  The flavors all go well together and I mean, with good ingredients you're going to get a good product.  Customer service was good and washrooms were clean, only complaint I have is that the restaurant isn't that big so there aren't a lot of seats.  Will I be back again?  Absolutely!  I want to try everything there.  As said earlier these bahn mi are far from the norm and I mean, I do love the norm but these new concoctions are just fantastic."}
{"text":"I had the duck confit banh mi. It is 7.49 plus tax.  Bun is warm and toasty yet still soft, which is a definite advantage and the duck meat is juicy and tender and the veggie toppings are fresh.  However despite all these good qualities, I didn't feel a \"wow factor\" as I was expecting based on the rave reviews on Yelp.  Maybe its because I'm cheap and feel like banh mi should be under $4 or maybe its because I'm slightly sick right now but the duck confit banh mi tasted like a cheap pulled pork sandwich.    Personally, it's not bad, but I'm not sure its worth it.  I'd much rather pay $3.50 for a slightly inferior banh mi at Ginger than 7+ dollars at Banh Mi Boys.  However, I will visit again when I am less sick and may have a different opinion then."}
{"text":"Expensive hipstery Viet sandwiches. A bit pricey for me, but worth to check out his mom's place in Chinatown where she makes more authentic sandwiches that are $2-3 for a basic Viet sub or $3-4 if you like grilled chicken or pork."}
{"text":"Best vietnamese sandwich I have ever had in Toronto. Tried grilled chicken sandwich, biah mi pork belly bun and kimchi fries. So good! Yummy. Tried medium and hot. Will try extremely hot next time."}
{"text":"The girl at the register must had a rough night. She need to cheer up and smile. Life is not that bad. It could be worst. Don't worry all guys are dicks. If you ain't happy there always an option to switch side.   Ok, for me to take the subway all the way up from the financial district. The food must be good. Yes!, the food is amazing. I order 5 spice pork belly. Oh damn, it's yummy. I shared kimchi, pull pork fries with my colleague. It was good too. The price is decent. Nothing that will break your bank.   If you around the neighbourhood and need a quick bite. Check it out."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap! Had to wait in a long line at lunch but it moved quickly and was well worth it.   The bao bun was extremely tasty. I got the chicken but I got to try a little of everything as I came with a group and it was all good. We were lucky to get a seat but we didn't stay too long. Typical bench style seating."}
{"text":"I love a good Bahn Mi. BMB do it well and serve a good amount of meat, but I always want more veggies. Cannot even tell there is cilantro, which to me is essential."}
{"text":"When was the last time you experienced the perfect bite? It was probably with someone special, somewhere sentimental, important to you. Maybe on vacation, stay-cation or during a relaxing weekend.  I experienced the perfect bite twice in one place. It happened on a weekday in between meetings, just after lunch rush. Even though it was around 2PM, the place was packed and seating was hard to nab. I never knew a \"sandwich\" could taste so good, but I'm telling ya now, it was better than good... It was awesome.  Banh Mi Boys is the type of restaurant I really enjoy visiting. It's small but efficient. There is almost always a line and the seats are pretty much full too. It's worth the wait though. At the end awaits your taco, banh mi, bao, and/or fries.  I've tried pretty much everything on the menu and everything is good, but if I were to recommend 3 things, they would have to be the Kalbi Beef Taco, Fried Chicken Bao, and Kimchi Fries. The tacos are sorta like poratas, filled with pickled veg, kimchi, and sauces. The combination of flavors are out of this world! A literal explosion of salty, savory, sour, tangy, spicy and sweet in every bite. The fried chicken bao is a great complement to the taco because it's a direct foil of it. The bao is soft and sweet, while the fried chicken is crispy, succulent and juicy. Very well seasoned with the same toppings as the taco. The big surprise was the kimchi fries. I absolutely loved the contrast of flavors and how they worked harmoniously. Kimchi, pulled pork or tofu, crispy fries, green onions, pickled veg and mayo-ish sauce. You can just imagine the textures and flavors bouncing off each other. Simply something you just need to try. I usually don't like kimchi, but this dish made it interestingly necessary.  The Banh Mi is good but not amazing. It didn't blow my socks off but my taste buds were certainly intrigued still. I prefer my sandwich a bit different, aside from the filling. The bao and tacos are winners.  Banh Mi Boys is consistently delicious and well made. It feels like every sandwich was handcrafted from start to finish for you. You wait for the privilege of experiencing these flavours but you also wait for the privilege of trying something new, something different and exciting. The next time you swing by Queen and Spadina, drop in and fetch a taco or bao. At $3.50-$3.99 you win every time."}
{"text":"All of the workers at BMB are always on a grind, and I respect that!  Everyone is on their game, from the cashiers, to the people preparing the orders, to the aunties in the back.  All of them make magic happen...  drool worthy, delicious magic.  If there's isn't at least one item you enjoy from Banh Mi Boys, I do not trust you."}
{"text":"Small joint that can get really busy. Personally wouldn't wait long, but the eats here are tasty. Think of Viet subs with a Asian fusion twist. Eg. They out Korean and Japanese toppings on a Viet sub, or Taco or Bao.   Great for a small snack. My Faves are the Baos. I've tried all of them and they're all good.  IMO service is a tad slow for such a small menu, but they're all really nice."}
{"text":"First banh mi I've had outside of T&T.  Ban Mi Boys adds a modern flare to the classic by offering several types of hot meats.  I got the grilled pork, pork belly and duck confit.  They were all full of flavour and if I had to pick it would be the pork belly.  Kimchi fries are great as well.  Oh ya, and my six year old lost his front tooth to the duck sandwich, see the pic."}
{"text":"Had the tofu banh mi...solid and packed with flavour. Swift friendly service...and in and out affair. Recommended for a quick snack!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp. (Obviously) So one night decided to walk in and try it out.  Wow. Ok the line up to order and pick up is CRAZY!!! However they are fairly quick with prep and fairly quick with delivery.  It's a bit different from your regular banh mi, fusion style. They serve banh mi on a baguette but there are many different styles of fillings like duck confit with caramelized onions and your choice of different levels of spice or no spice at all and hoisin sauce instead.  Feel like a change in style when it comes to fries? No problem try their kimchi fries. You can opt for their regular fries or changed to sweet potato fries for a small price.  The kimchi fries are simply......nope can't find the words. It's such an incredible match of spice and carbs that it's just toooooo yummy to describe.  The shop is pretty small you can dine in but there really isn't much space. So best to do take out, however there's still quite a wait.  Best thing to do..order ahead. There's an app for that."}
{"text":"This has been my go to place for take out for the last year. Pair a simple banh mi with some fries and you got a huge meal that'll keep you satisfied. They also have baos there if you're over the whole banh mi scene.    It's quick, easy, and definitely very tasty."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a quick lunch takeout.  My favourite is pork belly steamed bao. If you are a pork belly lover, this is what you should try. It's tasty and doesn't put a hole in your wallet, it's only $3.49."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto and this was one of the go to places that came up when doing my research. I was not at all disappointed. The portions were big and packed with flavor. I had the duck confit bahn mi with some kimchi fries. I was a total fatty but it was so worth it."}
{"text":"Once again, Bahn Mi Boys has not disappointed me again. I decided to try the Steamed Baos rather than the Bahn Mi Sandwiches. I was not disappointed. The Baos were fluffy and light while maintaining its shape with all the contents inside its pouch. The Five Spiced Pork Belly and Pulled Pork were seasoned beautifully and had a lot of flavor inside. The sweet potato fries were prepared fresh as it was seasoned well , right after coming out of the fryer. The garlic mayo was a great compliment to the sweet potato fries.   The prices were inexpensive and I had a great meal for a little over $10 ! I will definitely keep coming back as it is as good as it gets at Bahn Mi Boys !"}
{"text":"Ordered the steamed bao, pork belly and the braised beef along with a taco. Was definitely good. I'm pretty fond of vietnamese food so I figured I'd definitely love this place. The steamed bao had a nice sauce that somewhat kind of tasted like teriyaki. The pork belly and braised beef were dope. The taco was awesome too. Didn't expect that!"}
{"text":"I think this is my third update to my review.   Still stellar, I'm still in love. I keep forgetting to mention the staff here. The guys making the magic happen behind the counter are really nice, very friendly dudes. I keep coming back here for a number of reasons, but the staff definitely put the 5th star here for me. Way to go guys, keep it up and I'll keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"Very skeptical at first, because of its high price for Banh Mi but the 5 Spice Pork Belly has made me a fan.   And oh, the Pork Belly Baos are great too.  Anything with pork belly is great.  My only qualm is that their \"hot\" and \"very hot\" is not very spicy to me, but then again I don't find spicy beef patties spicy anymore..."}
{"text":"This isn't the most traditional Vietnamese sandwich spot, but they do a pretty good job of putting a twist on it and making it good. We tried the bbq pork sandwich, grilled chicken sandwich, tofu taco and kimchi fries.  The bread here isn't super toasted and crispy where it'll scrape the roof of your mouth which is an experience I usually have with a lot of Vietnamese sandwiches. Both sandwiches were pretty flavorful, they're pretty generous with the fillings as well. I really enjoyed the kimchi fries, this is poutine styled and also includes pulled pork. The kimchi wasn't too sour or too spicy just as I like it. The taco was interesting, they use a roti style pancake as the taco shell. The prices were fair. I shared this meal with two other people and we were pretty full."}
{"text":"Came here after reading other Yelp reviews. We had the 5 spice pork belly bau, pork belly banh mi, and kimchi fries. The bau and banh mi were really good - I'd say freshness and ability to pick your level of spiciness were the best parts. I've had more traditional Viet sandwiches, but the ones here are definitely a worthy enough comparison. The kimchi fries were delicious - they sound weird but are actually very good!"}
{"text":"We were in Kensington Market, and it was hard not to eat, but knowing Banh Mi Boys was nearby, I stayed away from the food.  I ordered the meatball banh mi, and the kimchi fries, girlfriend ordered a pulled pork banh mi, and the jicima salad. All was very good (next time I will ask for no cilantro) the g/f even liked the kimchi (only had it once before, and it wasn't good, so she thought she'd hate it, turns out they use really good kimchi) The jicima salad was really good too, the dressing was great, I will order it again.   We both noticed the chicken banh mi, I think we will both try that next time."}
{"text":"Instead of banh mi, I came here for the baos. The soft buns come with cucumber, pickled carrots, and cilantro. I had the five spiced pork belly and fried chicken baos. I enjoyed both of them, but favor the pork belly. The pork belly was tender and the sauce complemented it well. The chicken was crispy and also tender. The meal was very affordable. I wish we had something like this in Sac."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick little snack .. My go to club bao and a duck confit bahn mi.. This place is so frickin good... I screwed up and didn't get the kimchi fries..."}
{"text":"This is the best place to stop in when I am on the run and hungry as well! I always get the bulgogi tacos and they are DELICIOUS!!! and also very cheap and filling as well. I have not ventured any further than thie tacos as I end up getting them every time I am in. Next time I am there I am looking forward to trying out the kimchi fries! What a great fusion of Korean/Vietnamese food! Looking forward to my next trip!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place if you want to grab a snack.  We ordered a grilled chicken Banh Mi and a 5 Flavor Pork Belly Bao.  The Banh Mi was a tad on the salty side but the Bao was really good.  Decent price for the amount of food you get.  Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Very happy with the food and the service. I got bahn mi with braised beef and sweet potatoes fries  Worth the visit. The prices are low and the quality is high. I was stuffed and happy after. Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Giving BMB a five stars soley for their Kimchi Fries. The amount you get is ridiculous for the price. And they even add pulled pork to it. Add some mayo and secret sauce, and I am salivating thinking about it already. Will be back. Sometimes the line is short and sometimes annoyingly long for the small restaurant."}
{"text":"The kimchi poutine is quite divine, and it comes in a huge portion (great price for what you get)! However, it can get a bit greasy if that's the only thing you eat. We also got the fried chicken steamed bao and pulled pork taco. The bao was fabulous, the meat complemented well with the refreshing and tangy crunch of the julienne vegetables.The taco was not too special compared to the rest, but good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Ok food I think too hyped! It is worth trying once. Banh mi means Baguette in Vietnam : it is slightly different than French Baguette. They add meat/ tofu, some sauces and shredded carrots. Food is simplistic and affordable, service is quick too. Try Bao which is like a steamed bun it is different!"}
{"text":"The best. Always the a great spot to grab a snack ( bao ) or a nice lunch ( banh mi ). All the options I've tried are great, you can never go wrong. Personally, I like the 5 spiced pork belly banh mi/ bao or the fried chicken bao. I usually get the kimchi fries and split it with a friend."}
{"text":"Super delicious. The banh mi has all the punching string flavors all contained in a think crisp soft bun. The meat was soft and amazingly tender. This will be a regular stop for me"}
{"text":"The best tasting Vietnamese sandwich that I've had. Way better then Gingers. I had the grilled chicken. Ask for spicy/hot as it is tolerable and adds a nice flavour. You can double the meat as well. I heard the kimchi fries are good. Very tiny place inside that can get very busy."}
{"text":"The steamed bao fried chicken is great! You must eat here now."}
{"text":"I've walked by several times while absolutely starving but was turned off by the line.  On a not-so-hangery evening (yesterday), a friend of mine visiting from Vancouver and I decided to stop in.  There was a bit of a line, but it moved pretty quickly. The girl at the cashier was nice enough of explain what the three key selections were (banh mi, bao, and tacos), along with their sizes.  I got a beef cheek bao- which sounds odd, but was essentially pulled beef- while my friend got the pork belly taco, and a beef cheek bao, and we swiftly grabbed one of the only remaining seats at the counter.  It less than a three minute wait when we were called up to pick our spice levels for fresh assembly.  The bao was good, nothing extraordinary- soft and moist, fluffy, but with good chew. The beef was really good- wonderfully rich and seasoned to perfection.  Topped with pickled carrots and cilantro, in combination, the little sandwich was absolutely amazing! Perfect hot to cold, soft to crunch ratios.  One was perfect for moderately hungry me, but the fat child in me definitely screamed for a second.   Be warned, seating is limited (of course, compared to crowd), but for food of this quality, it's worth getting your lean on."}
{"text":"Ordered the pulled pork sub and the kalbi beef sub.  We have attempted to try this place out, but the first time we dropped by, the restaurant was closed for renovation. The second time around...it just happened to be closed on that specific day. @_@ We finally caught it open the third time we went though.  The restaurant is a small place, but people don't stay long because they leave after eating their sandwiches/tacos. You can see them cooking all your meats freshly behind the counter and they would customize it for you :O  When I was eating the pulled pork sub, I was confused why people were willing to pay so much for a Viet sub. You can buy a yummier (but cold) one for $2 in Chinatown which isn't too far away. Then I tried the Kalbi beef one and figured it wasn't so bad after all. Moral of the story: don't get pulled pork.   This is an unique restaurant that people definitely should try, especially if they are a fan of Viet buns, just because it is something new though. This isn't a place I would eat at regularly...probably not going to go back actually. I am perfectly content with my Chinatown Viet buns that costs a quarter of the amount of one sub here."}
{"text":"Coming from the states where it seems like everyone here yelps to not having a ton of yelpers here, I was quite surprised to find this place had so many reviews so I decided to stop by here on the way to the aquarium.   Unlike some reviews, the place wasn't packed and we ordered our food fast. When it came to asking for the spicy level of our food I wanted the second hottest level. The poster made it seem like it would have a fair amount of heat. It didn't. On top of that, I wasn't really impressed with their tofu fries.   Would I come back? Yeah if i didn't know what I wanted to eat and I was close by....maybe I came here with a higher expectation from the hype I've read from previous reviews...or that I'm from Cali and I'm comparing it some of the ones I've had here."}
{"text":"Currently the space between Spadina nad Bathurstast is full with place to eat. However most of the place are not that great. Bahn mi boys is  cheap and delicious. The customer service is great. Love the place. The only recommandation is the place can work till midnight."}
{"text":"Good price for quality food. This location is conveniently located on Queen Street across the strest from the TD Bank and near Chinatown. I ordered the grilled pork banh mi (you pick how spicy you want it) and jicama papaya salad. I went Friday night and it was kind of busy but the wait was not long at all and there was plenty of space to sit. I would definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"The steamed buns are aces if you're static on chewing! The preserved veggies are what set forth the meaning of vietnamese sandwiches. The carrots and daikon are sufficiently brined to leave enough crunchiness."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is a great, casual place to get delicious food. I have been here 4 times, and consistently have received quality, tasty product at a reasonable price. I have tried various menu items and have not been disappointed. MUST try the kimchi fries. The service is awesome, food off the chain and price points are great.  The ONLY reason I did not give it a 5, is that it can be a HUGE challenge to find a seat (this is true of either location). I want to be able to sit and enjoy my food (not have to take my bao by hand and eat it messily while I walk along Yonge). Wish it was bigger!"}
{"text":"I was in the area this past Friday, so I decided to drop in for a quick snack to see if all the hype was warranted. The concept of a grilled meat/chicken banh mi on a warm lightly toasted baguette is not  a new concept, it's usually available in most Vietnamese fast serve cafeteria style/take out restaurants downtown and I'm not referring to the normal banh mi shops in Chinatown for around $2.99 to $3.49.  I ordered the grilled pork banh mi ($4.99) and the kimchi fries ($5.99) and both were very good and executed nicely. The baguette was fresh and nicely toasted and the pork was nicely grilled accompanied with pickled carrots, cilantro, cucumber and the right amount of house mayo and asian bbq that did not drown the banh mi and make it soggy.  The kimchi fries are an interesting creation, kimchi with hoisin sauce, mayo, pulled pork and cheese over a fair amount of hot fresh fries. I can see the popularity in this item, mix of different flavours that mesh well together.  The place is quite small and narrow but when I was there at Friday around 5:30pm, the place was really busy, a combination of good food, decent prices and a great location."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is a safe go to spot for quick eats. No frills order your food and they'll call you when it's ready. It's always busy so expect a line up.   We discovered the Club Bao (pork belly + chicken) and have never looked back - you can also do the club Banh Mi style as well. Kimchi fries are great for sharing  comes topped up with kimchi and pulled pork. Habaneros on the side."}
{"text":"PROS:  -Great food, cheap, quick. Generous servings.   -Cool, hip atmosphere.  CONS: -A bit cramped inside.  Overall: -Yummy Vietnamese Sandwiches. Will fill you up."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very good value on all the items.   Had the pork belly steamed bao, squid taco, and braised beef taco.   The tacos themselves are really good soft shell. Have always been a big fan of the bao as well. Very plain and let's you really enjoy what's in the sandwich.   Massive fan of the coleslaw/salad mixture they use on all of their sandwiches. Has a sort of spicy, cilantro taste to it.   Will eat here again"}
{"text":"We were intrigued when we first saw the signs go up for Banh Mi Boys - after all, banh mi sandwiches without having to trek the extra few blocks north to Chinatown for them sounded pretty awesome.  I won't say we were disappointed, but we were also not completely blown away.  The sandwiches themselves are inventive takes on classic Vietnamese sandwiches, exactly what you'd expect from a trendy Queen W fusion joint, and they are well executed, my only issue is that they lack the one or two things that make Banh Mi so good:  A)  The buns - the best part of a Banh Mi sandwich is the bun, they're incredibly light and airy on the inside, and super crisp on the outside.  The buns here at BMB, although edible, just aren't up to scratch  B)  The price - for those who haven't ever ventured north on Spadina, it might not be obvious that what seems like paltry amounts of money ($5-$7.50) for a sandwich here, is still over twice the price of the genuine Vietnamese sandwich shops literally three blocks north, where you get possibly less sophisticated, but, dare-I-say, fresher-tasting, and time-tested combinations that explode in your mouth in a way these ones don't.  I can't really fault them for this, since their rent alone probably justifies a three-fold increase.  Of course, this place has a lot more to offer than the shops on Spadina, so if you're looking for great and still very economical fusion-ey eats, BMB is a solid choice.  Faves were:  Squid, and Kalbi Beef.  Although you can eat here, I find it a bit cramped, so take-out would be our recommendation - some of the sandwiches actually improve a bit by giving some extra time for meat juices to sink into the bread."}
{"text":"This place was very packed on a friday night, and as such i expected it to be really good. since seeing the long lineups and the hype i heard about it.   boy was a disappointed, i tried the kimchi fries with the pulled pork. and i have to say the taste was sadly not that great. and on top of it i felt it was very unclean as right afterwards i had to go to the bathroom. I can't really recommend highly on this place as it seems creative is on their side, and the price doesn't seem overly bad, however the taste and cleanness is what i doubt.   i would not want to try again, after having stomach problems from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Another fantastic find!!  Food: I ordered the pork belly for $3.49 and was in heaven. It was perfect. The dough - the filling - the sauce. I couldnt have been happier. Atmosphere: It wont be featured in a Decor Magazine anytime soon. A bit bare bones - but the food makes up for it. Service: OK. Nothing to write about it.  The lay out of this restaurant needs to be reconfigured. When you walk in - there was a line so I stood there too, ONLY to find out that they had placed their order already and were just waiting around to pick it up.  I also wish there website would have INFO on it. i.e hours, a phone number - you know, basic stuff!!  I hear they are renovating and will reopen in Feb!! Looking forward to this."}
{"text":"I give this place 4.5 out of 5. Its pretty tiny inside, but it didn't matter to me since I gotmy order to go anyways. I went with their braised beef cheek banh mi ($6.50) which I loved! The bun was SSOOOOO FREEESSHH! And having crisp cucumber and carrots added in there, along with a very flavourful onion chutney made the sandwich even better!! What I also really liked is that the sandwich is a really good size - it lasted me 2 meals :)  I also got an order of the famous kimchi fries ($6.50) which i actually wasn't very impressed with. The friea tasted as though they were sitting around for a while,  the box it was served in wasn't full, and it all just tasted a little soggy.....maybe I just got the odd bad batch. Regardless, I was very impressed with the banh mi and am excited to try more flavours!"}
{"text":"Five Stars, never have complaints! Good value and yummy tastes. What else can you asked for?"}
{"text":"It's a popular spot for a reason. I've been to both this location and the other Yonge and Gerrard location, and I feel like both have the very same traits: long lines at peak hours, a few tables that often very packed, relatively clean-ish, and more importantly, quick and efficient service.   I've had the kimchi fries, the pork belly and fried chicken steamed bao, the sweet potato fries, and the grilled chicken sandwich on various visits. If you want something semi-healthy tasting, get the grilled chicken sandwich (still delicious, but not always my first choice if I want to go all out on deep fried goodness). If you want true deliciousness, get the fried chicken steamed bao or pork belly bao, and the kimchi fries. The baos are delicious and stuffed with meat. The kimchi fries are generously portioned and seasoned perfectly.  The sandwiches are pricier than I'd like (we paid around $6.00 for the grilled chicken sandwich on a recent visit). But, note that most items are below $10.00. Overall, a very reliable spot with quality food that I'll keep coming back to."}
{"text":"The Vietnamese sandwiches here are the bomb. They're the perfect size so you can also squeeze a bao in there and maybe some kimchi fried.   I usually go with the pork belly or braised beef. I haven't tried anything else yet but I prbly should... I stick to the regular level of hot because it's the perfect amount of spice and flavour to me.   I love that they have a nice assortment of drinks- they even have mango juice and the speciality root beer in a bottle!   The staff work super fast and so the long line ups are never a problem. They're also really nice, considering they have to deal with so many people. I love this place and am going to keep coming back anytime I head out to Queen Street!"}
{"text":"I love the prices here because that means I can try a number of items all at once.  Ordered a 5 Spice Pork Belly in Steamed Bao, a Grilled Pork Banh Mi both medium spice level and also a side of Kimchi fries.  5/5 - 5 Spice Pork Belly in Steamed Bao was delicious. The bun was fluffy and soft. The pork was seasoned just right and was tender with crisp edges and a tiny bit of char.  4/5 - Grilled Pork Banh Mi was good. The baguette was crusty outside, soft on the inside and had a satisfying chew to it. The ratio of filling to bread was good. It didn't have pate nor jalapeno pepper.  2/5 Kimchi Fries - the kimchi was mild in spice level compared to most I've tried. It had shredded pork under the kimchi (nice surprise) I would rather eat the toppings with rice.  Better to order to go because they're not good at cleaning up their tables, hence minus a star; loved their murals though. Gotta come back and try their secret menu item: Club Bao with fried chicken and pork belly stuffed into one of there fluffy steamed baos."}
{"text":"This little shop located about a minute walk northwest of Queen and Spadina is one of my favourites for a quick fix of the Asian snacks or a full blown meal.  With a name like Banh Mi Boys, you'd expect a shop of just the Vietnamese sandwich, banh mi, but you'll find that they offer more than just banh mi, they also have sandwiches made with Chinese steam bun, as well as tacos for more of a health-conscious option. You're going to need sides to go with that sandwich or tacos of yours, that's why they have a selection of fries and salads.  While there are limited amount of seating at this shop, you'll see that many customers stop by for a takeaway order. It's not table service, so you order at the counter, pick up your order and freely seat yourself.   I still remember the first time I came here, I wanted their try their secret menu item, \"The Club Bao\". The menu lists bao options of beef cheeks, pulled pork, fried tofu, pork belly or fried chicken. The Club Bao is a bao with pork belly AND fried chicken. It was honestly the best thing ever and every visit since then, I have either ordered the Club Bao, or Club Banh Mi (only if I'm super hungry or taking it home). Yup, fried chicken and pork belly in a banh mi, it holds very well if you're not eating it immediately. But at the end of the day, club bao wins, because you have the soft bao so you can fully experience the texture of their crispy fried chicken, and the thick and juicy pork belly.   If you've ordered a banh mi, bao, or taco, you have the option to select the hotness to complete your order. I always go for medium as it's just sriracha and who doesn't like sriracha?  Kimchi fries were also ace (which you can also have in a bao, shh, secret menu).  I have visited this place many time and haven't once had a less than stellar visit. The music is always great, and when it's warmer outside, they open the garage door so if you sit by it, it's like a patio.  And word has it, that when Alton Brown was in town, this is where he went."}
{"text":"Like mhnmmm....the kimchi fries are soo good! The chicken bahm mi was soooo like mhmmm too. Service great! Cleanliness, great! Ambience, great! Totally date worthy place? Don't know yet....i better i find one haha"}
{"text":"Good solid Asian Thai/Viet sandwich, served quickly.    Location has a steady flow of traffic, it has a handful of tables for those like me wanting to dine in.  Service was good and friendly, and when I left they asked how I enjoyed my meal.  If you are looking for elaborate Thai/Viet food this is probably not the spot, but if you would like a good quality sandwich/bun this is an excellent spot - lunch or late night snack.  I will try again next time in town"}
{"text":"Oh holy damn. Cheap, fresh, tasty lunch eats.  A line snakes nearly out the door into the wintry December daylight. Single file, they wait, corralled by stainless steel prep counters and, beyond them, the open kitchen and the smell of sizzling pork belly. I join them.  \"Five spice pork belly banh mi, please.\"  As with so many momentous utterances, it sounds prosaic in the moment. Only through the lens of history can we see those moments -- inflection points, say academics -- when the world changes and a new reality is ushered forth.  \"As for toppings, make it tasty.\"  The new reality is this. Meat cooked fresh to order. Vietnamese sandwiches. Korean tacos. Vegetables to balance and excite the palate. Something called \"luck sauce.\" Prepared with a smile, by people who want you to enjoy it. Cheap.  Pro-tip: Luck sauce. Do I need to say it again? Do you feel like you have all the luck you want in life? Not interested in any more luck today? Luck sauce."}
{"text":"No mock sausage cuts or the ubiquitous pate spread here. This is A1 quality stuff from a simple, short-order menu. The lineup is long and constant, but the pay-and-wait system is surprisingly efficient and short. Can expansion and franchising be far behind?"}
{"text":"I went here with some friends during Caribana weekend and they were hesitant at first. But because I have an awesome palette they throughly enjoyed it. Since we were from Boston and we weren't going to be in Toronto again anytime soon, I decided to go all out. I got the braised been banh mi, kimchi fries, and the fried chicken bao. It was all amazing and I ate everything. The kimchi fries seemed like it had a lot going but it was perfect and the flavors blended well. The soft bun complimented the fried chicken perfectly and it was crunchy but not dry. If there was BMB in Boston, I'd spend all my money there."}
{"text":"5 stars for the kimchi fries.  Crispy fries topped with kimchi pulled pork, green onions, and mayo... it was heavenly.  The portion is large so it's perfect for sharing, or even as a meal for 1 by itself.  Everything else was nothing out of the ordinary.  I ordered a 5 spice pork belly banh mi and bao (I love me some pork belly!) which were both decent, except for the fact that they were both overloaded with pickled radish and carrots, which took away from the actual taste of the meat.  There's a limited amount of seating inside the establishment, so we placed our order to go.  I'll definitely come back here just for the fries!"}
{"text":"The meat selections are all very flavorful and tender! now they need to add a fish item on the menu ;)  the line up can some times get long, but it's pretty fast.  the seats inside is very limited, but at least there is some seats! I love how it's a take-out kinda place, So I can go in and grab something and go anytime.  I like literally everything on the menu! from the kimchi fries to bao, bahn mi and tacos (the taco shell is not the regular taco shell, it's like roti bread, even better!)  it's some times hard to find parking on busy queen street west, so I see a lot of locals coming here."}
{"text":"We were making our way to the original banh mi boys location, and drove by this location, I was like OMG! OK we drove around looking for parking (there is no parking lots near by? we were lucky to get a parking spot on a side street in front of ryerson)  So We tried this place, on a saturday evening, no line ups and seats available! yay. The food is just as good as the original location, love love love the kimchi fries! the five spice bao and duck confit banh mi. tried most of the items already, and still can't wait to come back for more! The drinks were a bit expensive, Tried this canned mango / guava juices? they were $3 a can."}
{"text":"Overpriced Banh Mi... It's good, but it's not worth it for the price."}
{"text":"AMAZING recommendation by my friend to order the kimchi fries! yay!! it was an awesome combo of the kimchi and pulledpork and green onions topped with mayo.  I can't believe this combo works!!! Not dissapointed at all. Instead, we enjoyed eating it so much we decided to make it at home as well ( Yummy... quite easy to make from now on!!)   tried their pork belly banh mi as well. However, I must say, we totally killed the fries and after the bf and I shared, we were too full to stuff our face with the banh mi (we only got one to share and still couldn't even finish it). .... After trying to take a few bites, it was pretty good too!! but the FRIES FTW!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for a quick and tasty lunch. They have the best grilled chicken salad! Oh and nothing beats their amazing sweet and squishy baos, so good! Thanks Banh Mi Boys!"}
{"text":"Came here with a pal tonight for dinner and I can't wait to go back!  This place is quite small so you may have trouble finding seating. Luckily as we got our food, a table by the door opened. You go to the counter, order, and wait to pick up your food. It's fast food so turnover rate for tables is quick (I think).  We ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. The sandwich is H U G E and you can definitely share it. I especially like the baguette - crunchy and good. Ingredients are fresh so a cilantro-hater like myself can ask for no cilantro. Mayo adds to your sandwich; I also found the spicy sauce to have a 'kick,' which made the sandwich all the much better.  I want to try the taco and steamed bun so I will most definitely be back.  A solid four stars here."}
{"text":"I have been to the BMB on Queen Street so decided to check out their second location. It looks just like the other place - narrow and small. You order your food, leave your name, and then wait for your name to be called. We ordered grilled chicken banh mi and a grilled chicken taco. Both of the cilantro-less banh mi and taco were tasty. The chicken is grilled nicely with a sweet sauce; the pickled vegetables along with mayo and hot sauce make this sandwich in a bun awesome. It's pretty reasonable considering what you get.  Good for: lunch, dinner, late night snack"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of bahn mi, so I figured seeing a joint open up with the undertones of turning bahn mi into a new food trend would be intriguing. The result is, overall, good. The sandwiches are consistent and legitimately taste of a higher quality than the subs you get in Chinatown--but you pay for that, and the trendy vibe.  If you want bahn me to cost three bucks, have weird cold cuts on it and be absently tossed your way by a humourless curmudgeon, consider sticking with Chinatown bahn mi places instead of waiting in the regularly long lunch/food tourist lines.  Two standout reasons to go, though: squid bahn mi, and kimchi fries. Don't bother with stuff that's not far from cheaper conventional bahn mi."}
{"text":"We went into Banh Mi Boys for dinner on a Friday. Br prepared to wait, as it is a popular restaurant. It may be difficult to obtain seating for groups bigger than 4.   I ordered the pork belly banh mi with extra meat and medium spice. The extra meat was a definite plus and the spice really does enhance the taste of the sand which.    We also ordered the beef banh mi which was good on its own. We didn't get any spices for this but I felt that it could've been improved with a bit of spice. I definitely would order the pork belly over the beef sandwich if given the choice.    We also ordered kimchi fries, which tasted okay. It probably wasn't as good as what you would get in a Korean restaurant. I'd definitely return again to try some other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Where revamped Banh Mi all started. Great place for takeout, and unique flavours. Not a big fan of the baos but the Banh Mi and kimchee fries are amazing. Decent pricing"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is my new favourite lunch spot in the dt core for a few reasons.  Firstly, it's cheap and affordable.  I'm a pretty cost-efficient/frugal type of person, thus I'm not usually down to spend $10+ on some unmemorable, mediocre, carb-loaded lunch that spikes my blood glucose level and makes me sleepy.  Banh Mi Boys, on the contrary, offers a wide selection, ranging from $3.50 Pulled Pork Baos to a $12.00 Club Banh Mi.  Secondly, the food is pretty damn good.  Thus far, I've had the Grilled Pork Banh Mi ($6.75) and the Fried Chicken Steamed Bao ($4.00).  Both have been delicious and flavourful, containing pickled veggies, cilantro, cucumber, mayo, etc - It's like a party in your mouth.  Obviously, the Banh Mi's, at the higher price, are more substantial than the Baos, but sometimes, you're not that hungry and just need a light lunch.  Tbh, I think that lunches should be a Bao-sized portion on average and society would do good by it.  Lastly, this place is efficient af.  I've ordered using the Ritual app, and my order has been ready within 10 minutes - this is perfect, as it takes me about 10 minutes to get to here from work.  Both times, I simply walked up to the counter and told them I ordered via the Ritual app, and they've handed me my food already wrapped up to-go with my name on it.  No need to risk having to wait in a long lineup during your lunch break - just use the app.  Luckily, I've reached this place before 12pm and it wasn't too busy, but after 12pm, a lengthy line forms and you'll probably have to wait a decent amount of time.  Banh Mi Boys delivers on all fronts - affordable, tasty, efficient food, allowing you to save your wallet, taste buds, and time, respectively."}
{"text":"So...  Finally, after reading all the great reviews on this place, did I have a chance to mosey down and take it for a spin.  And, a whirlwind ride, it was.  This place is the shit.     The set up is tucked in a tiny place just a few doors down from the Queen W and Spadina intersection, and granted, could easily be missed if you were not looking for it.  Upon walking in, one is greeted with gloss of shiny red booths, with a few laminate tables, for those lucky enough to grab a spot to sit.  The remaining stylings seem current and work A concise menu sits above the counter where you place your order.  A few stools are peppered about.     My fellow foodie and I ordered up a couple of sandwiches, trying both the beef cheek and the pork.  We waited with anticipation, as a round of twenty- some people rolled in after us, chatty, and pupils dilated with excitement.     It was fantastic.  The bun was warm and soft, like a hug from your Mom.  That is, if your Mom were a Vietnamese sandwich.  (Mine would be a crustless cucumber spiral, on a tea tray.  However, that's not who we are reviewing.  She's not a sandwich.  Nor, is she Vietnamese.)  Fresh corrinader, pickled carrots, cucumber, nested in with the meaty portions.  I prefered the beef cheek over the pork, which I found a bit fatty, and not as tender as it's companion.  Take out might be a challenge, as some things are best served warm.  Warm, like the love I feel for this sandwich.  Swoon.    Post note: Overheard while eating - a fan with a newbie, regarding the impeding meal, \"Just wait until you taste it.\"  Eyebrows lifted.  Heads nodded.  Yes, friends, this is it."}
{"text":"Damn.  This.  Place.  Delivers. I need not add anything that anyone has not as of yet touched on already.  Believe the hype.  Get yourself here for a tasty lunch.  On the cheap. Leave happy and satisfied.  Yes.  This is it.  Oh.  Wait.  Order up the jimica papya salad with grilled chicken.  Awesome."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I started coming to this place a few months back and now we just can't stay away! We are never disappointed and always leave feeling full. The price is very reasonable as well! It's good for lunch or dinner.   My favourite bao is probably the fried chicken. The crispiness just balances the sauce and the soft bao so well! There is also a squid one and some other great choices like pork belly etc.   You are also a fool if you don't get the kimchi fries...a fool I tell you.  So delicious!"}
{"text":"Tasty Kimchi fries, Banhimi buns and Chicken soft Buns. Yummmmmm!"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys lunch lineup can sometimes get insanely long. There's a lineup for you to order your food, and then a lineup for you to pick up your food. However, it's most efficient in my opinion for the amount of people they serve. A part of me wishes they would hear my name correctly, because people always call Christine or Krystal, and I tell them every time that my name is Kristy.  I got the five spice pork belly bao - which was a little under $5. It wasn't too big of a meal, so it's debatable if you think it's worth it to purchase - it's mainly just the soft man tau bao, meat, some veggies - the total cost of buying the ingredients for this and making it on your own is probably $0.50 or less.   For a 10 minute wait time, it's definitely debatable if it was worth it, with no additional seats either. The taste of the bao was good, but oily, it was literally finished in a few bites. It did taste okay though - maybe another less busy location would have been a better experience."}
{"text":"Straight up LEGIT! This place has awesome Bahn Mi sandwiches and Kimchi fries. It puts any other place to shame.  Lemon grass tofu sandwich, Kimchi Fries and a taco- BAM!"}
{"text":"There really isn't much more I can say that everyone else has not mentioned in their reviews about this place except to attest to BMB's deliciousness.  From my experience, BMB is always packed but they are so freakin efficient that the wait time is reasonable. The only unfortunate thing is you will probably not be able to get a seat (at least for me I have not been able to) but there is always the option to take the food to go.  Kimchi fries are served in what I consider a large portion and are great to share. I found them to be a tad bit on the salty side but maybe it was just my taste buds acting up. My favourite menu item is the squid taco and coming in second is the panko tofu steamed bao. Both very tasty, flavorful, and decent sized sandwiches that I inhaled.  Menu prices are on the lower end of the scale - for one sandwich (tofu & squid are around $3.99 each). I find just one sandwich is enough for a meal so really $4 for a good quality lunch/dinner is a bargain downtown.  Overall, BMB consistently has a good casual atmosphere, excellent food, and friendly + efficient service. 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"If you've had Banh Mi sammies before you'd know them as great valued sandwiches with a simplistic taste but perfect for a light lunch. This place is pretty much Banh Mi on steroids. Dish out a couple more bucks and you've got some dope stuff now. I had the Steamed Bao Five Spice Pork Bun along with hundreds of others who reviewed it and it's delicious, my girlfriend had the sandwich verson of the Five Spice and it's just as good. We had the Tofu Kimchi fries to share and coming up below $20 it was pretty damn perfect. Their tacos and their other flavours are intriguing and I'm excited to come back and try some more!"}
{"text":"I loved  loved  loved this place!The food tasted fantabulous, it was cheap and fast!My only disappointment  was that there isn't much room to sit but being so centrally located I can take this place as a quick meal joint or a togo joint!!!   I walked in on a rainy/snowy day at around 4ish and the lines in here were long but don't be discouraged they got their GAME right -the orders were taken fast and line moved pretty quick!  MY ORDER!!  Fries with garlic mayo were a completely hit!!Thick cut piping hot fries with some garlic mayo on the side, next time I'm def asking for some extra of the sauces!  Crispy chicken bao was a delight.The chicken was tastefully battered and fried and the bao was soft and fresh and the vegetable toppings were crunchy along with the sauce.  The beef bao had an amazing caramialized onion relish on it and the meat was braised and pulled along with crunchy vegetables!  All three items were complete satisfactory and were a delight to my tastebuds!! I'm home now and am already craving their baos-next time I'm definitely trying their bun-mis and kimchi fries!!I have become their FAN!!!"}
{"text":"I usually order the pork bun boa. The boa is soft and fresh, the pork belly is flavourful and the garnishes are well balanced. The kimchi fries are alright, the fries are a bit frail. There is usually a lineup to order but it moves fairly quickly. It's a quick and cheaper alternative to the momofuku pork buns."}
{"text":"** 3.5 stars  This place was recommended by my boyfriend's cousin who live in Toronto. I am from Washington DC so i do not wanna be bias. The place is a very small and hole in the wall vibe to it. We walked in and there was a small line but it went by quick. My bfs cousin said the kimchi fries were to die for so we got that and also the 5 spice pork belly banh mi. Honestly the banh mi was good but nothing to special because DC has amazing banh mi for cheap. But the kimchi fries O.M.G  it was great. I normally dont like kimchi but this was too good. It had pork on it with the kimchi and some mayo sauce and green onions. I would come back here just for this. Honestly its like poutine with asian twist. I loved it. It was a great experience while I was here visiting but hopefully I can come back when I visit. If you like asian fusion its a good place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally review a place with 600+ reviews, but these guys deserve the 5/5. Which, come to think of it, is probably why they have such a high rating after 600+ reviews. Hope they maintain quality / service / value price levels as popularity rises.  Hard to say anything that hasn't been said. The options are amazing. The modern take on bao is innovative and well executed. Ingredients are screaming fresh, the outcome is tasty. Service is fast and efficient. Pricing is fair and a la carte options make it all very affordable. I don't have a single criticism about this place.  Pro tip: if you're going in the day time, go before the lunch rush, which can start before lunch as take-out/pick-up orders are called in."}
{"text":"Solid! Ate here twice in a weekend. My favorite item was the tofu bao, although the kimchi fries were pretty great too. I also got a lemongrass tofu sandwich and it was very tasty."}
{"text":"Strolled here for lunch and service is quick and efficient.  I ordered the galbi banh mi.  Banh mi was toasted and warm but also remained soft so that the sandwich crust didn't fall apart in your hands.  The pickled veg had the right amount of sour and was a nice complement to the galbi beef which was made to order.  Next time, may have to try the five spice pork belly banh mi.  Last minute, decided to double up and order the kimchi fries.  The portion is definitely meant for sharing or as a meal on its' own.  Looked very vibrant with the red kimchi, green spring onions, white sour cream, and generous serving of pulled pork.  It was very delicious and done well.  Great gourmet take on chinatown classic."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times.  Love it!!  Great amount of food for the price you pay.    This place is more of a fast food type of place. You order at the counter and pick up your food. The place is small as there are only maybe 6-7 tables there.  Depending on the time you go, you may not find a place to sit.    The food is incredible. Get the Kimchi French Fries for sure.    I've also used the Ritual App in order to avoid the line up.  lol.  As there is always a line up every time I have been.  Feel free to try it out by using code \"Jenny1393\" to get $10 credit ($5 to try and then another $5 after you tried it).  My food was made quickly and ready for pick up when I got there.  Plus I bypassed the line up using this app.      One time I got there early and asked to just have it there.  Which they easily accommodated.  I will definitely be back as the food is amazing.  I highly recommend this place.  I would probably go there once a week if it was closer to where I lived."}
{"text":"Great food and at a cheap price.  I ordered the 5 spice pork belly banh mi and an order of kimchi fries.  The sandwich was slightly spicy but the pork belly was nice and juicy.  Combined with the cucumber, carrot, and jalapeño, the sandwich was superb! Kimchi fries are something new to me, but again, a wonderful surprise.  The mix of kimchi, pulled pork, and mayo work wonders on the fries.  I would suggest if you go to order one or the other.  After finishing the fries, I still had half the sandwich left over.  Definitely make sure you stop by your next time in Toronto. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop here as our last stop of our food tour of the city.  We got the grilled pork banh mi which tasted quite flavorful.  However, the bread got a little soft as it was sitting inside a to-go bag.  I wish we could have consumed it while it was still warm and crunchy. Nonetheless, it is a nice place for a quick and cheap bite!"}
{"text":"Still love the sandwiches to death.    However ... I wasn't crazy about the bao. Maybe it was because I didn't know I was suffering from food poisoning from the previous night (ugh...) but the pork belly bao for lunch was disappointing. The bao was tender enough to bite through, but the pork belly needed a chew, and the bao's flavours didn't meld. Though they cost more, I love the iterations by Momofuku and Ippudo much, much more.  The kimchi fries ... interesting, but it was fries with stuff on top. I wasn't crazed."}
{"text":"If you're looking for banh mi, this is the place in Toronto. I would recommend the pulled pork and braised beef, both for the steamed bun and sandwich versions."}
{"text":"Since I'm a vegetarian there were only a few options on the menu for me. I chose a lemongrass tofu banh mi (sandwich). On the plus side: the bread was fresh and hot, plenty of toppings, decent price, quick, adequate service. Unfortunately my sandwich was incredibly bland. There was no taste at all of lemongrass or much flavour of any kind. All of the ingredients -- tofu, cucumber and carrots are very mild tasting and combined resulted in a very \"meh\" taste experience. I may try one of the other vegetarian menu items but wouldn't order this again."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times. Quick and  efficient service.  Love their steamed bao....I also tried their fries on a previous visit, nothing special.  This time I tired the fried squid Vietnamese sandwich, fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"So this is the first time I've been in and I can say I'll be back. I had the grilled pork banh mi sandwich with the jicama papaya salad.  The sandwich was yummy with hot grilled pork, carrots, cucumber, and a medium spicy sauce.  The salad was the perfect side.  I will definitely be back to have a taste of the steamed bao (I have my eye on you, five spice pork belly)."}
{"text":"I threw in the towel. I thought I could handle a banh mi and a taco. Nope! These things are tasty and huge! Going to go back again.  Now to decide, bulgogi taco or pork banh mi?"}
{"text":"Consistently good. We ordered a whole bunch of Fried Chicken Buns to share but ended up eating them all because... well, our friends can get their own darn food."}
{"text":"This place is PACKED for lunch on weekdays with a line that goes from counter to door, and there's a good reason why: this place has upped the ante on the lowly Vietnamese sub with delicious, novel and well-executed hot fix-ins, fresh toppings and amazing sides for Chinatown-inspired prices.  Plus they have a drink fridge with vanilla coke, diet lime coke, vanilla rootbeer and other uncommon sodas.  I went with 3 colleagues and shared a braised beef cheek, sweet cooked onion and hot pepper bahn mi.  super flavourful, great colours and textures, melt in your mouth and nicely filling.  The pickled carrots and turnip were fresh, delicious.  The bun could have been crisper on the outside (hence the 4).  Also shared the sweet potato fries, and the kim chi fries.  AMAZING.  especially the kim chi fries, which were inventive, really nicely cut so the fries were crispy, and topped with a generous topping of pulled pork, vietnamese sub sauce (mayo?), some mild kim chi, green onion and WOWZA.    I will definitely go back for more and try the options - pork belly, squid, pulled pork, chicken, and lots more permutations.  Next time though, I'll get there earlier to beat the rush."}
{"text":"Duck confit banh mi is what you want here. Other fillings are great as well but where else can you get a duck confit banh mi? Kimchi fries are also great, a meal on its own. Consistently good and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Kimchi fries are delicious and very well portioned for the price point. The layers of flavor are marvelous.   The steamed baos and the banh mi's aren't particularly impressive for their given price points. I prefer the traditional ones. They're also so much cheaper.  That being said, I would come back just for the fries."}
{"text":"So I've been to Toronto a handful of times over the past couple of months, typically staying at a Hilton in the entertainment district.  On my last trip, I discovered Bahn Mi Boys, and I'm sure all of my subsequent visits will include a trip here.  Absolutely AMAZING sandwiches--perfect bread, quality toppings, and most of all, UNIQUE and DELICIOUS flavor!  I had the Kalbi Beef bahn mi and the pork belly steamed bao.  I'm not sure if I can adequately express the deliciousness of these items in words, so I'm not even going to try, but if you are wasting your $5 on Subway or a crappy Tim Horton's wrap, you are a complete idiot.  I hope to eventually try every item on the menu here, except for the Tofu (obviously).  One word of advice, I ordered my Bahn Mi with \"medium\" spice, and I didn't get much heat at all, so I'd recommend upping the heat a bit if you like it hot.  For all of the expensive meals I've had in Toronto, Bahn Mi Boys was not only the MOST delicious, but it was also the BEST value!!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to make it a point to come to banh mi boys every time it come to Toronto! Kimchi fries and duck confit banh mi are a must! I've had the duck confit twice already and I really want to try the rest of the menu but can't get myself too bc that duck is so tender and flavorful! The papaya jicama salad is yummy and easy to eat too. Such friendly prices too!"}
{"text":"Pork belly banh mi sandwich is sooooo good! Lots of flavor, lots of pork, really affordable for what you get. The service is great. Boom! Coming here again!"}
{"text":"If you find yourself at the corner of Queen & Spadina, look out for the \"giant star\" logo!   We were lucky to come for our first visit AFTER the reno because after reading the reviews about it before, I'd probably sack a star off this review.  The Interior NOW is fun & simple. The loud burst of color that draws you in further comes from the long tomato red bench, curved ceiling feature, and geometric \"asian lanterns\". Cute touch! The rest of the eating area consists of a single wooden plank wall, white tables lined against it with metal chairs, and tasteful graffiti on the opposite wall.  WE GOT THESE BBQ Pork Banh Mi - BBQ pork with fresh veggies in a toasted baguette $4.99  Kalbi Taco - soft taco with grilled peppers and onions, loaded with Kalbi. $5.99  Kimchi Fries - fries with green onions, sour cream, cheddar cheese, pulled pork, and yeah, kimchi  $4.99  The favourite is the Banh Mi! - Tasty fresh meat, the veggie combination was a little off, baguette was toasty warm and crunchy on the outside and soft and spongy in the inside! Mmwha!  Close second is the Kimchi Fries - Really really good! But after three bites, I felt I had enough. At first I liked the kimchi in it. Then I changed my mind.  Not a fan of the taco. The soft taco was too thick and dry. Very tough to chew. The meat was done very well and tasted great. But having it last, it just didn't shine.  Truthfully, it was good, but the winner for Banh Mi is still at The Eden Centre in Virginia!  But that's quite far for us now, plus the staff HERE are the friendliest people in the world! Take that, McD's!  Good quality for cheap eats and always comes with a smile? Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to banh mi a few years ago by a friend in Toronto. I have no idea why banh mi isn't popular in New York City (or maybe it is and I just don't know it?), but I don't know how I lived without it. It's super cheap and delicious -- you can never go wrong with banh mi! I ordered the braised beef banh mi with jalapeños, and it felt a little dry, but I ate the whole thing without any complaints.  A friend and I just had a road trip to Toronto and she never had banh mi before, so of course I had to take her here!  Her thoughts? Delicious. My thoughts? Banh Mi Boys will never go out of business as long as I'm around."}
{"text":"Most of my Asian DT friends label this as the overpriced banh mi restaurant as they remember the good ol days of $2 Banh Mi sandwiches in Chinatown however I'm addicted to the Kalbi Beef Sandwich and the traditional cold cut banh mi sandwich can't compare IMO.  It's also conveniently located if you're taking a stroll on Queen street."}
{"text":"Really like the fresh new take on Banh Mi's, grew up on that stuff :) and loving the Kim Chi Fries. Just one bothersome thing I noticed on my return visit, walking into the place I noticed a smell of not so fresh pork and the staff seemed like they were too cool to care teenagers. Anyways, I've raved about this place to my boyfriend. Despite noticing the place did not smell right, I ordered him a Pork Cheek Banh Mi and shared a Kim Chi Fries when I finally asked him what he thought, he said it was disappointing and both of us felt sick after the kim chi fries half an hour later. He's usually the easiest guy to please when it comes to food with really low standards, so i felt really bad. Maybe try enrolling the staff or management themselves in some food-handling courses or find another provider to purchase pork?  We'll see, maybe there will be an update to this review."}
{"text":"Seriously good food for low prices. First time here and loved it. Pulled pork taco = amazing! Pork belly Bao outstanding. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"The five-spice pork belly banh mi, and the kalbi beef taco are the two best things I've had here. Delicious and cheap... not compared to China town, but for what you're getting. Very well-run kitchen and friendly staff. A great fast-food or take-out option when you're around Queen and Spadina."}
{"text":"TL;DR: I've always loved Vietnamese-fusion food. On the top of the list is Banh Mi Boys. This is a personal favoruite when thinking of Downtown Toronto cheap eats. You can get your Bahn Mi fix here at a great price, along with some delicious kimchi fries if you're stomach is up for it. I do warn you, all the locations are packed during peak hours (lunch, especially). I personally recommend the fried chicken bao, any of the bahn mis, and the kimchi fries. If you know you want this for lunch but you're tight on time, order through ritual or foodora; it'll be worth your time.  Food (4/5):  I have been here a countless number of times, and I usually am not disappointed. The place does smell a bit funky because of all the asian ingredients they use, but believe me when I say that the food will not disappoint. Personally recommend the fried chicken bao, any of the bahn mis (which in my opinion are the best deal), and the kimchi fries. Note that the portions for the fries are pretty big, and since it's so heavy, it's probably best to share it with a group of people. Also, you dont have to stick to their spice levels. You can tell them to add a combination of jalapeños, habaneros, and sriracha.    ------- Overall (4/5)"}
{"text":"Came to this location after not eating at any of their locations for a while.  Personally I find the bao's ($3.50-$4.50) are okay but prefer the banh mi sandwiches ($5.50-$7) as they are much more filling and a better value.  The pulled pork is okay, but their Five Spice Pork Belly is my jam. Legit tasty pork with just the right amount of crispy edging and great flavours.  Despite the size of the line when I was there, I'll say they got through the orders pretty quickly when I stopped in here randomly.  Yet another time when I ordered through the Ritual app it took excessively longer so who know what's up. The place does get busy since there aren't a lot of other good lunch takeout options north of Eglinton. I'll likely continue to make this an occasional option when in the area."}
{"text":"Its a good banh mi sandwich, and probably better than most places in Toronto. I guess my issue is that while I've appreciated them for the cheap and adequate form of food that they are, I'm yet to really be wow'ed by a banh mi sandwich. Something about the pickled vegetables that just doesn't impress me. But if banh mi is your thing, you'll probably likely really dig this place. Their variety warrants a 4th star even if I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"So my friend brought me some takeout that we snuck into a movie theatre and ate.  All I have to say is... WOW. WOW. WOW. WOW. WOW. WOW. WOW. WOW.  I have the Five Spice Pork Belly Baguette. OMFG THIS WAS AMAZING. WHATTTT. AMAZING.  I couldn't really see much, it was dark in the movie theatre. BUT WOW.  And we split the Kimchi Fries. DELICIOUS. PULLED PORK AND KIMCHI ON MY FRIES??  Was this magic????  OMG Can't wait to actually go there and get the full on experience!!!!!  7/15"}
{"text":"Not as great and did not meet all the hype.  Quasi-Asian food disguised as fusion.  The banh mi meat was extremely dry and the kimchi fries did not have real kimchi.  You can try it once to see what it's all about but there are better places in town for banh mi (chinatown, even ginger has better ones)"}
{"text":"This is the original location and are slowly expanding their footprint  This is Vietnamese and Korean fusion and they do it very very very well  The only issue is that this location can have long line ups at times but the food is worth it and they are very efficient at serving fast  My favourite is the pork belly bao, squid taco and sweet potato fries  The Banh Mi sandwiches are based on the Vietnamese staple but with different ingredients and the Kalbi Beef is a favourite.  I am not a fan of the kimchi or tofu fries as it does tend to mush the fries a bit  Tip: have your eating partner grab a seat before ordering. They only have seating for like 20 people"}
{"text":"Beats Momofuko any day  The squid taco and the  pork belly bao is the order  If your diet can support the sweet potatoes fries then you are all in for $10   Ask for hot  Enjoy!   It's worth the drive/ttc to downtown"}
{"text":"kalbi beef bahn mi, fried chicken bao, pork belly bao, and kimchi fries. all under 25 bucks and it was amazing!!!  First time here today! Some friends can't believe that I'm so close to this famous shop and never walked in, so today i gave it try.   I got the bahn mi with habenero sauce and the baos with jalapenos. the jalapeno was not nearly spicy enough so i'd have to up my game next time. the pork belly was not the most flavorful, and kimchi fries didn't really need the mayo all over it... but all the rest of the chow were tasty as hell!   Will come back, will try other stuff. I can't believe i didn't come here sooner. Bahn Mi Boys, you are awesome!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place after the great reviews and would say, was pleasantly surprised by the really affordable prices - I tried a Braised Tofu Banh mi and my friend tried a pulled pork one. However, didn't find anything outstanding about the taste or how it was served but a good sized sandwich to fill us up."}
{"text":"Been here many times now. Great place for lunch...brunch...dinner. Whatever you like. Food is always good."}
{"text":"I had the 5 spice pork belly bahn mi and was super awesome. The bread could be better but the veggies and pork were awesome. Wish I had these at home. Will update on next visit"}
{"text":"this place is great. cheap eats and delicious food. the fresh baked bread on the bahn mi sandwich is exceptional. the pork belly bao was also top notch. The availability of multiple levels of extra spice is always appreciated. it does get a little crowded in the restaurant and the food takes about ten minutes when the place is really busy. the only serious con I can think of is no alcohol there, but a foodie's dream nonetheless."}
{"text":"Mouthgasmic. I fell in love and I want to tell the world!  Stopped by for a quick bite and everyone was surprised to see that I've never had banh mi boys before. I've heard great things and bad things about banh mi boys (mostly bad things from my viet gang telling me it's not even close to real banh mi)   The line was a bit long but it moved quickly and there was a large space to wait for your food. There are tons of options and even for vegetarians/vegans...YASSS!!! I got the tofu banh mi and it was so flavourful, my tastebuds went for their own trip. The tofu didn't even taste like tofu, the mushroom sauce and lemongrass flavour made it soo delish. Also got the tofu kimchi fries and HOLY SHIIIIIZZZZZNIZZLES.. I think I passed out and came back alive. Fries didn't feel soggy from the kimchi, and the tofu slices were huge. Did I mention, I fucking love tofu? Oh man, the flavours made me want to commit sins.   110% am going to return to banh mi boys. No doubt."}
{"text":"I had the 5 spice pork belly banh mi sandwich, my friend had the chicken banh mi and we shared an order of kimchi fries. First bites were heaven. I got the 5 spice pork belly with spiciness (it wasn't that spicy so people who are afraid of the heat won't have a hard time chowing down) and the spices on the meat are really good - they blend well together and the veggies in the sandwich complement the spices and give it extra zing, flavour, zest and crunch. My friend enjoyed her chicken bahn mi - I had a bit of it and it had a more subtle flavour than the pork belly but was delicious nonetheless.  The kimchi fries were amazing - I wish they'd put more kimchi in it though because it really goes well with the sauce, meat and veggies on the fries. I would definitely just come here for the kimchi fries because they truly are a burst of flavour and the kimchi on the fries is just pure genius."}
{"text":"Always aware of the hype but rarely making the trip downtown, I was a bit excited to find out that Banh Mi Boys would be opening in my hood and after having eaten there plenty of times since, I'm glad they did.  Sure, you can get a traditional banh mi elsewhere for cheaper but those places don't offer the variety of choices that you get to choose from here, The amount of ingredients they stuff into each of the items justify the price.   Admittedly, I still have to try their basic banh mi but I've enjoyed the other different items that I have tried. Maybe I'll finally go for the basic for lunch today?"}
{"text":"Yes the sandwiches are good but the real star is the Kimchi fries. At first it may look like something a frat boy would throw together after a long night of binge drinking but after the first bite, you'll realize just how good everything goes with each other.  It's like crack in small white cardboard box. Tread with caution if you care about your waistline."}
{"text":"Grymma smörgåsar! Var där flera gånger. Åt grilled chicken Banh mi och chicken Bao. Sjukt gott och prisvärt. Allt gick snabbt och smidigt. Rekommenderas verkligen!"}
{"text":"The kimchi fries are worth the visit alone. Everything I've had here is top notch and super tasty."}
{"text":"It is a great place to grab a quick lunch.  We got the kabli beef banh mi and the braised beef steamed Bao.  We chose the medium spicy (which is a line of sriracha sauce). The next level was jalapeno peppers and the most spicest is the cabanara peppers.    The seating is minimal so I can imagine this place being packed on the week days for lunch.  In total, there are probably 15 seats?  As for the kalbi beef, the texture is soft and that is a plus.  The bread was toasted just right.    Steamed Bao was good as well.  The steamed Bao is worth trying because the Bao is a different type of bread.  To choose between kalbi or braised beef, I am leaning towards kalbi.   For a filling meal though, the regular banh mi is suggested.  Over all, good place and I will come back again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Much better than the \"Bang Mi Boys\" which are a bunch of guys I used to date in Toronto.  What to get: Bulgogi or Pork Banh Mi. Amazing. What else: If anyone tells you not to come here, it's a load of Bull, gogi.  I came here looking for Boy George and George Michael, Bono and Simon LeBon, Bob Geldof and Paul Young. I should have gone to \"Band Aid Boys\" instead.  BMB is worth absolutely all the hype. And there is plenty of hype. I know people, both Torontonononononians, and people who have visited here a lot, who, asked which one single place I should eat in T Dot, have said BMB. But it really is that good. I love Mi and good Banh, but not all BMs are created equal, and BMB is the pigs of the Animal Farm.  If you think having children should be illegal, maybe you're one of those \"Ban Seed Boys.\"  The first time I came here I had their Bulgogi Banh Mi, and this most recent time it was the pork. Either way you can't go wrong. They're utterly amazing. I could eat 5 of them in one sitting, but they're not the cheapest, so I probably wouldn't.  I asked them to sing a little ditty on their mini guitar. They didn't oblige. Should have gone to \"Banjo Boys.\"  Their other location on Yonge St is just as good, but slightly busier with even less parking options. Don't miss out on one of the best sandwiches in North America when you're up in Toronto.  And if you're sick of Scott Stapp, I am too. So let's go to the \"Ban Creed Boys.\""}
{"text":"Right off the bat I'm excited by the smells of the grill and the sights of the nerdy apperal. Seating is extremely limited but My lady and I got somewhere to plant ourselves.  I got the pork belly banh mi and the duck confit bao. Exciting and honest flavours play upon the pallette. The vanilla cream beer was exceptional. The service was quick and pleasent.  I went back for a quick braised beef bao before our show started. Wow. I could say wow all night about this place.  Go! Eat all the things!"}
{"text":"Great they opened up near me other than downtown TO. Love their sandwiches. Great food, fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"The best thing about Banh Mi Boys is simple: Kimchi Fries   I'll say it again: Kimchi Fries.  For about $6 you get a very large box of fries topped off with not only Kimchi, but Japanese mayo and spicy pork. The flavor combinations are delightfully nom nom yum!    Add that to their fun  atmosphere, pleasant staff and the other yummy menu items and Banh Mi Boys is pretty great."}
{"text":"I love this place for a quick lunch or take-home dinner (where I can enjoy with a beer). I'm a huge fan of the 5 spice pork belly on a steamed bao (the spicy, sweet, tangy pork belly and soft bao is a winning combination). And the kimchi fries are amazing!! You get a big portion too, so I would recommend sharing with a friend if you're both getting banh mis/baos as well.   A must-try!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Banh Mi Boys?  They provide really tasty foods at a very fair price. I've only tried their Grilled Pork Banh Mi ($6.50) and their Fried Chicken Bao ($4.50). Grilled Pork Banh Mi used to be my comfort food until my boyfriend made me try their Fried Chicken Bao, which is now my favourite. I love how the bao has a sweet taste, and the pickled carrots and cucumbers blend so well together with the spiciness of Sriracha + the extra mayo on the side.  Service is 4/5 because the wait time from my experience is usually 5-15mins. But I will definitely go back.   Food: 4.5/5 Price: 5/5 Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"Only had a little taste of this shop part of a food crawl  but was so impressed! I will definitely come back here to try the rest of the menu. It's amazing, I wanted so many things from that menu but couldn't eat anymore.  So we ordered the kimchi fries and the five spice pork bao to share and I only wish we ordered more. The fries were great and I don't know why some people didn't like them! Medium cut skin-on fries (the way it should be), with creamy mayo, pulled pork, and kimchi is a heavenly combination. It works so well together! If you don't like kimchi you probably won't like it though so opt for the kimchi-less fries. I actually have never tried a bao and thought it was fantastic. The sweetness of the bao pairs extremely well with the sliced pork and the pickled vegetables provide a nice sweet, fresh crunch. I didn't try their Bahn Mi as I was looking for a new food experience but am now looking forward to it, the question is how does it stack up to Nguyen Huong's?  Service/ordering was fine although I wish they had a bigger shop to seat more people. Food came out in a timely fashion with no complaints.  Until next time Bahn Mi Boys!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the five spice pork belly and the kimchi fries are a must! I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone! Everything is delicious and affordable. A must go for anyone who is in Toronto."}
{"text":"Visited after seeing way too many delicious-looking photos on Instagram.  It did not disappoint.   I had the Duck Confit sandwich - I'd definitely recommend it.   It's a very popular location, the tables were near full when I went and the line took nearly 15 minutes, but it's worth it for the quality of the food.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Was here twice in their first week of opening because of the Sporting Life 10k - once for a banh mi sandwich after I picked up my race kit, and once for a huge cheat meal post race.  Banh Mi Boys is a Toronto institution, so I won't go into details about what it is. This is simply a quick review for their newest location just north of Yonge and Eglinton, which opened on May 2nd.  You can tell the restaurant is new - everything is spotless. It's your typical food counter experience, just like other Banh Mi Boys locations.  In my two visits, I had the duck confit banh mi, five spice pork belly banh mi, fried chicken steamed bao, and the kimchi fries.  The duck confit is still my favourite banh mi from them, ringing in at $7.50 pretax. There is an ample amount of meat and the flavour of it is just out of this world. Kimchi fries are a must on each visit as well - however I would definitely recommend sharing it as the portion size is quite large."}
{"text":"This is always my go-to place whenever I need a quick and delicious snack at an affordable price. It is an order-and-go type of place, with limited seating, and a washroom if needed. The veggies are standard yet fresh (cucumber, carrots, radish, daikon), and are served in one of three different breads (banh mi, taco, bao). I've only stuck to ordering the banh mi and bao so far and my favourite meat is the pork or pork belly.  Most of the time the oil/sauce is slopped onto the bun, which makes it easier to eat with the rest of the \"bread\". Warning: it can get a tad messy when eating it."}
{"text":"It's funny how I love Banh Mi Boys but never had the banh yet!  I'll try it next time, but it's hard to do when everything I've had from here has been perfect.    My friend bought me the kimchi fries and a bao for a treat.  Kimchi fries tasted pretty good and I loved the pork in it.  It was my first time having bao and I was blown away.  The pork belly was perfect, bao was a nice texture, and the vege fillings complemented the taste and brought it all together.  It was perfect and I needed more.  I came here to get 2 more baos and a taco to try out  The taco was pretty good but couldn't compare to the bao.    5/5 for good prices and amazing food."}
{"text":"Had to come back to Banh Mi Boys for a second round of some great food. I had a great experience at the Queen location so I knew I was in for a treat.   This time around I ordered the pork belly bao (again, because it's so darn good), grilled chicken taco, and kimchi fries. Food was ready quicker than at the Queen location!   The bao was amazing as usual. The pork is just perfect and the different textures and flavours coming together are perfect. The softness of the bao, tenderness of the pork, and crunch of the veggies always get to me!   The taco was a little disappointing. You don't get that same taste as you'd get with the bao. Might as well get the bao instead!   The kimchi fries once again were great. The flavour would get a little bit too strong for my tastes sometimes, but I still enjoyed it. I recommend trying to get a little bit of everything together into each bite. When I got the pulled pork, fries, kimchi, and sauce all in one bite, it was seriously perfect.   Overall I gotta give this place some love once again. 4.5/5"}
{"text":"This place is perfect, best bao in the city hands down. My last review says it's missing a salty sauce... Honestly I don't know what I was talking about. The Panko tofu has a salty coating and the sweet and sour sauce compliments if perfectly. The bun itself is always fresh! It takes a few minutes to get this order and it's always worth it because it's always super hot and tasty. Also the tofu fries are great to share. Love it all!"}
{"text":"Bahn Mi Boys is one of the best lunch places in the city.   I've been so many times I know the place inside out.   The best things on the menu in my opinion are the Pork Belly Banh Mi, Squid Taco and a little sandwich I call the DIESEL. Which is grilled pork with added grilled chicken, spicy. It's amazing. $3 to add chicken though.   There is always a line so it's best to go during odd times, but even with a line they are really fast. I love Banh Mi Boys. Love forever."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious and cheap.  It's definitely fast food, but it's delicious.   I can't say a bad thing about this establishment.  They're on top of it."}
{"text":"It's exactly what you've heard: pretty awesome. Cheap, fast, delicious, and satisfying. What more can you ask for?  Also, I may be biased because I have a shameless kimchi addiction."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today. Had the Braised Beef Bao, Kimchi Fries, and Jimica Papaya Salad. I found the Beef in the Bao a little 'dry' but with good flavour. The Bao itself was freakin awesome!  (The pork belly Bao probably would have been a more flavourful alternative but I wasn't in the mood for something that rich)  Kimchi Fries were delicious but had wished for more 'kick' from the kimchi. Jimica Papaya salad was 'ok'.  Overall a nice change from the regular burger, taco, and other offerings in the area. I'm a fan!  Service was helpful and friendly. Establishment well kept."}
{"text":"I loved this place - I tried both the Yonge location and the Queen St one - I definitely think the cook is better at this location, and highly recommend it. Customer service at both locations are great. I recommend trying the steamed pork belly and deep fried chicken baos, so good! I will definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"I had a grilled pork and kimchi fries. The pork was very juicy with nicely picked veggies."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times now and always  enjoy it.  The service is efficient,the staff are typically friendly and the sandwiches and the Kimchi fries are amazing. Wear your jacket, every time the door opens you freeze!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I don't love this place as much as I used to but I think that is my fault because I came here too many times. They are super consistent which is great and great value for the flavour it packs.  The pork belly bao is highly recommended as well as the kimchi fries. The fried chicken banh mi is also pretty good. Also bonus points for carrying cherry coca-cola!!!!!  During peak times it gets pretty busy and might be difficult to get seats. So, if there is more than 1 in your party I would say to have someone grab seats if available while someone else does the ordering."}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese, so when I first heard of Banh Mi Boys I cringed because it reminded me of all those Vietnamese fusion restaurants gone wrong.  But Banh Mi Boys is amazing. The first time I had the Pork Belly Bao, it blew my mind. Mind you traditional Banh Bao is not like how they serve at Banh Mi Boys but I don't care. It's just that good.  The five spice kills it (in a good way). I believe what is pickled daikon is the sh*t. I live for that pickled daikon everytime I have a banh bao.  One time I got the pork belly bao and thought they forgot the pickled radish I was so upset only to find out that I was wrong. That was the best day ever.  The Kimchi fries are tasty (I don't even like kimchi). And lastly, that salad. I love that fresh cucumber, green papaya salad."}
{"text":"I went to Banh Mi Boys with a group of friends on Friday night to grab a quick bite.  The restaurant is a small, hole in the wall place with few seats and simple decor.  Banh Mi Boys looks more like a grab and go take out place and less like a sit down dinner.  Although the place is small and sparsely decorated, they have friendly staff and serve delicious food!  I was very hungry so I ordered the Pork Banh Mi, a Chicken Bao, Sweet Potato Fries and a pop.  It turned out to be a lot of food!  I really liked the Pork Banh Mi (a large vietnamese style sandwich with pork, carrots, mayonaise and various other toppings) and sweet potato fries.  I ordered my food mildly spicy and the restaurant provides choice for not spicy, mild, medium and hot.  I am not a big spicy food eater, so the mild spicy was just the right amount for me.  Some other items my friends ordered include (in no particular order) Kimchi fries, Tofu fries, vegetable bao and fish bao.  All the food looked good and received generally favorable feedback.  Overall, I enjoyed the food and would come back for more, and possibly go for takeout.    3.8 / 5.0"}
{"text":"Great fresh sandwiches, busy during lunch Staff is friendly and the place is clean Definitely recommend the chicken Bao"}
{"text":"Hot Sandwich style Banh Mi. What can I say...? Great food, staff is attentive and have quick service. From the Braised Beef to Grilled Pork, I haven't had a sandwich i didn't like here. Absolutely commendable and a must go to if you're in Toronto."}
{"text":"Good fusion food and great prices! I love their Tofu sandwich. Even their sides are really good - awesome takeaway too!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointing banh mi compared to Vietnamese sandwich chains such as Lee's. As for the tacos, they're a sad ripoff of the Korean taco concept developed elsewhere, plus their tortillas aren't even tortillas but some sort of naan - scallion pancake hybrid.  Also, this location smells like rancid mop water."}
{"text":"Ordered their club bao (fried chicken + pork belly) on ritual at around 11pm on a Saturday so they had just opened and was really empty. I think I was their first customer of the day.   Service wasn't that great and there was no one else in store. It's not their fault though, they were probably still doing opening duties or something.   Food was absolutely amazing! I only got the club bao because it was my first time here but everything was perfect! The pork belly was crispy yet melted in my mouth, the fried chicken was also phenomenal. With the veggies and sauce, this bao was perfection!   Will definitely be coming back to try their kimchi fries."}
{"text":"Came back here 2 times while i was in Toronto. The food is great.   I tried the sandwich and the tacos and both were good. But what stood out to me was the Kimchi fries. Getting them with extra kim chi, beef and less mayo is also a good option."}
{"text":"This place is overrated and too expensive for what it is. I found that the kimchi fries were too salty. I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"Oh man, why doesn't Buffalo have places like this? They specialize in Banh Mi and they do it exceptionally well! Like, fantastic. I was starving and needed a quick lunch and found this place on Yelp being only a few blocks away from the hotel I was staying at.  When I saw the menu, I knew I wanted their pork belly Banh Mi. I ordered at the counter. It was under $6 and a worthwhile sandwich. Very filling. A toasted baguette-style roll with a delicious sizzling pork belly, jalapenos (on request), crunchy carrots, cilantro...and the result was a very delicious sandwich. My only complaint was that the sandwich had no mayo. The sandwich board made mention that mayo was optional, but no one asked me if I wanted it and I forgot to ask. Maybe it was my fault, but I think they should ask ;)!  Either way, this is a great place and you can't go wrong with a Banh Mi."}
{"text":"Very good value and fresh ingredient.  Too many choices but I tried the 5 spice pork belly on steam Boa.  Not sure I was really hungry or it's really good.  But will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Actually I've never had a #BanhMi and I was kinda expecting it to be the best sandwich I'll ever have. Well I wasn't wrong! It's awesome!"}
{"text":"I have a hard time paying more than $5 for Banh mi, having grown up with the ones from Chinatown most of my life, but I do enjoy their steamed baos with pork belly A LOT.  You can also order off their secret menu a \"club bao\" which has both the fried chicken and pork belly (overkill IMHO), but satisfied my curiosity.  The kimchi fries aren't as great as they sound, but still tasty."}
{"text":"So good, just so good. Pork belly is my favourite! It's good for lunch and I brought my European friend once and he was very impressed as he's never had it before. It gets pretty busy at peak times so I try to stay away during that period."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys.. at first i thought this was one of those viet sub place, but I'm glad my friend made me go here one day for lunch after a Raptors game.  This place is small and packed so if you want to sit and eat, you better come with a friend so that person can start finding a seat as you wait in line to order!  Good news is, people doesn't sit long at the table due to the fast food style.  My friend pretty much ordered one food from each category to try!  We had a Kimchi Fries, Five Spice Pork Belly Bao, Kalbi Taco and Lemongrass Tofu Banh Mi.  They were all very good, but the best for me was the Kalbi Taco, the meat portion was right and the flavoring was amazing!  If you are in the area, you must come and check out this place!"}
{"text":"The reviews don't lie, such a great Banh Mi, really affordable as well. Only docking it a star cause the place is so small there was nowhere to sit so I had to eat it outside. Get the Pork Belly one!"}
{"text":"over hyped and over priced... @ $6.50-7 per sandwich, its x2 - x2.5 of normal Bahn Mi. Neither did it taste x2 better nor x2 bigger than very tasty Bahn Mi's you can get at other typical Viet Sandwich places, so i rate this place 2 stars.  I wouldn't go back b/c i go to places that sell their premium Banh Mi's for $2.75 and they taste way better."}
{"text":"My friend got the pork belly and I got pulled pork. Bahn mi is very trendy ATM where I'm from. One of these would go off at home and you can see why! It was full of flavor an the kimchi fries were incredible! I posted photos and all my friends back home in Australia got really excited about them. You should too and try not to eat all day before you go so you can fit in the Kimchi fries!"}
{"text":"Affordable. Friendly staff. Clean venue. Good portion to price ratio. Yummy food. What more can you ask for?!? I will alwaysssss order thr kimchi fries when I'm here. When it comes to baos, I suggest you try the fried chicken one! Crispy, yet juicy. V large amount of chicken given too!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great customer serivce as the cashier will all smiles and expelained everything. This location can get quite busy. But the food is good!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love the grilled pork banh mi! It's flavourful and delicious and $5!!!   Savoury grilled pork with a mix of Asian spices and soy that reminds me of my mom's summer bbqs (we used to sandwich those pork chops with wonder bread but their Vietnamese banh mi roll is much better. And to top it off they add pickled carrots, cucumber, daikon, and fresh cilantro. I always get the spicy option but you can opt out and it's still delicious.  Their facebook page has them listed as Taiwanese and Asian fusion and although they have banh mi in their name, the food does remind me of some flavours found in a Taipei night market.   I love this place because they're great for a snack or a meal, most of their sandwiches, tacos, and steamed baos are about $5, and while their portions aren't huge, they're the perfect in between meals, happen to be walking by, craving something sweet, sour, savoury, spicy mix of goodness that can satisfy all cravings. If you're looking for a more substantial meal, you can always add a salad or fries. Add their kimchi fries with pulled pork and it will definitely fill you up!  I usually get their banh mi if I'm looking for something filling and their steamed bao if I'm looking for a snack. Their fried chicken steamed bao is also one of my favourites.   My only wish is that they were open later..."}
{"text":"I always loved the original Banh Mi Boys so it's no surprise really that I love this one.  Same great food at the same great prices, my personal favourites are the fried chicken steamed bao, the grilled pork banh mi and the kim chi or tofu fries are all delicious.   Since I didn't write about their fries in my post for their first location (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/banh-mi-boys-toronto#hrid:W1acUfav22ABBJo9ZtmL5A), I'll go on about them now...  Personally I love the pulled pork in the kimchi fries, it's smoky and delicious and not over saucy like some other pulled pork dishes.   But I went with a vegetarian friend a few days ago and shared the tofu fries and was not disappointed.   Same great crispy, caramelized fries that I could easily enjoy on their own, delicious slightly sweet mayo which I like to call Asian mayo because all the mayo I've had in Asia is sweeter than North American mayo, and the tofu is thinly sliced and marinated in lemongrass and absolutely delicious. Normally I like my tofu fried but since the fries were nice and crispy, I liked the contrast in textures. I also loved the hint of (toasted) sesame oil on the fries. The only thing I could do without was the kimchi itself tho it might be the origin of the sesame oil. Never being a big fan of kimchi, I found it mostly added sogginess and was ok in the fries but I could take it or leave it.  So why 4 stars instead of 5 like the original?  Surprisingly enough it was the service and energy...  The staff of the new location seemed less friendly and almost a little pretentious, I don't like it when staff assume you should just know their menu, even if you're popular and busy, there should always be time made for those that don't know. Especially with such a unique menu.  Also really loved the music selection at the original location, the new location didn't seem to have the same great selection.  Food, first and foremost so 4 stars for sure, and these could be a one/two off..."}
{"text":"Venue: Banh Mi Boys Specialty: Lunch Menu items: Braised Beef Cheek banh mi and steamed bao with sweet potato fries  The famous Vietnamese sandwich shop, opened for just over a year, has been luring the Queen West crowds with their fantastic take on Asian-fusion street food. So much so, that the Chau borthers, owners of Banh Mi Boys, are set to open a new location on Yonge and Gerard this month.  Banh Mi Boys has been my favourite go-to spot for lunch. I have to pace myself on the number of times I hit this place as their sandwiches and steamed baos are too good to be fat-free or sugar-free. My default banh mi is always the braised beef cheek kind.  With just the right balance of meat to veggies, this sandwich comes with a tender and juicy amount of beef cheek that has been braised, almost reminding me of the beef cheek dish one finds at Le Select, accompanied by a spread of onion chutney and julienne veggies - carrots, cucumbers, pickled onion topped with cilantro. The bread itself is chewy and though not freshly made, it's tasty and spongy.  Although Banh Mi Boys' is famous for its kimchi fries, being a sweet potato fan, my meal always comes with an order of sweet potato fries. They are tasty, sweet yet salty and perfectly fried. Without a doubt on my list of top fries in this city.  Other great selections from Banh Mi Boys include the pulled pork and five-spice pork belly. The duck confit salad is also a good choice.  Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick bite!  This place seems to be always crowded, so be prepared! My boyfriend and I went there on Sunday for early lunch (when they just opened) so we did not have to wait too long to order. There are at least four cooking staffs in the open kitchen so once you order you will get your food fast.  Although it was hectic in the kitchen, they were friendly and quick.There are several tables, but it will be hard to get a table if you are visiting during rush hours.   I ordered a kalbi taco and my bf ordered a pork banh mi. The price is very reasonable considering it is in the heart of downtown. Banh mi was big (bigger than I expected because it was only about $6) definitely can be a full meal by itself (not for a big eater though).  Hmmmm the taco was SO good! Kalbi was marinated very well (yes! Korean approved). Because it is so juicy, probably not a good idea for those who do not want to get messy. You can choose the spiciness of your food too."}
{"text":"We ordered it for lunch at work today. I was very impressed how easy and efficient online ordering is. The delivery is quick and you get texts with your order updates. The food was great as usual. We all ordered fried chicken baos and beef kalbi tacos. Both very delicious.  The only downside is the delivery charge of $8.50 plus delivery tax charge plus some other service fee charge. So you are looking at around $14 delivery."}
{"text":"Why oh why can I not live in the city, oh.... it's because I can't afford the cost of rent.... that's right.....  OHRIGHT, I'm to speak of food! Bahn MI is like heaven in a baguette  and this place does it so right , HOWEVER  they also got their bao game on lock! Steamed bun greatness, I did the 5 spice pork belly and it was rediculous, but oddly enough  the fried chicken  bao  surpassed the belly in goodness,but either is a win. Hit this place up, you will not be disappointed !"}
{"text":"I've been a frequent customer of Banh Mi Boys, they've always been great but lately their portion sizes for the kimchi fries have gotten smaller.  Significantly smaller while the price went up by a dollar. Hopefully they can rectify this by going back to their previous portion sizes."}
{"text":"I had the grilled chicken sandwich from here. The bread was GOOD, soft with a crunch. Veggies were fresh. Chicken could have been more flavorful; a bit too much mayo which overpowered the veggie and meat flavor. Overall, a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Really good food, thinking about it just makes me want it in my digestive system, however the price makes my wallet sad.  I'd recommend it in a heart beat, but it is over priced from what I usually get it for.  I had the tofu taco and the sandwich."}
{"text":"Cheap and good food. Baos are less than 4$ and they're pretty nicely sized. One is good for a light lunch. Two will keep you full for a couple hours. Got the pork belly and braised beef. Bill was about $8. Worth it."}
{"text":"Had the grilled pork and grilled chicken sandwich. Not a big sandwich fan but enjoyed both. Could have been a little more toppings which would have made it more filling."}
{"text":"Definitely a good bang for your buck. For the food you get to how much it costs, I would give that around a 3.5 - 4 star.   In terms of straight up quality, I would give it a two. There really is nothing special about the food that they provide. I'm not saying it's bad, rather, there's nothing that really makes you say \"wow, that's really good.\" It doesn't really make you have this urge to come back the next day and have another.   If you're in the area and need something quick to eat, then Banh Mi Boys is great. If you're looking to experience asian fusion at a higher level, then there are other places that do it better."}
{"text":"Not bad. Reasonably-priced. My pulled pork was a wee bit dry however my wife's grilled pork was much better. Nice to see something like this in the midst of Yonge Street. Something a bit out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"This place is usually quite busy, but definitely worth the line and wait. The food items are always prepared to order. I like kimchi but I'm not crazy about it - I like their kimchi fries and would give it a 4/5.   Their Banh Mi is quite good.. however I'm more of a traditionalist and would prefer the usual cuts of meat and pate that goes into it (as opposed to pork belly or bulgogi)   My favourite item on their menu by far is the pork belly Bao. It's soo good - the bao is always steamed fresh and it's a good size (palm of your hand) and meat always tender and seasoned to perfection.  The only thing that's keeping me from giving them a 5 is their price (it can get expensive) and their misses with me for other menu items."}
{"text":"Loved it. Tried the pork belly bao, braised beef bao, and the pulled pork bao and they were all so delicious!!  The pork belly was so fatty it was great. I had all the bao's with sriracha and it added a great touch with the pickled radishes. The only thing I would say is that the bao's were all steamed and that steam made the wrapping all soggy....which made it hard to eat but it wasn't a big deal because it was still delicious."}
{"text":"I'm not really impressed with Banh Mi Boys. Tried them once downtown a few years ago and just felt it was overpriced Banh Mi. I'm Viet so I'm use to the original stuff in Vietnam or at least the small stores in Chinatown which sells for like $2-3 a sandwich.   Decided to give them another go and tried the kimchi fries recently and thought it wasn't too bad but nothing to rave over. It wasn't hot enough for me but the kimchi added a unexpected spiciness to it that I did like.   Primary issue I was a bit concerned about is the cleanliness. There were so many fruit flies where I was sitting... It was off putting. Like I had to repeatedly squat them away while eating. Staff need to take garbage out more frequently.   Overall, my opinion hasn't really changed. I think its overpriced for what is offered and am confused by why everyone loves it so. If I'm ever in the mood, maybe I'll give them a 3rd chance and try the baos or a Banh Mi again. Lol"}
{"text":"Ok had to give in to the hype and try this place.  First off, it's pretty new - so don't rely on Google Streetview (as of Sept 2013) to show it on the street.  It's at the southeast corner of Yonge/Gerrard, on the east side of Yonge - you can't miss it.  I've been eating banh mi from T&T for years, and occasionally elsewhere, and was expected to be relatively blown away by the offerings here based on the hype.    The place is nicely decorated, not too fancy, and a bit small - but good.  Stood at the counter for a minute before I was quizzically asked if I'd been served.  No.  So the girl called some teenager from the back who was engrossed in his smartphone to take my order.  Not the best start.  Sat down and waited, maybe 5-10 minutes, and was called to pick up.  But no obvious place to go - the counter is long and with lots of staff it's hard to figure out who called your name, so you kinda of stare around until someone makes eye contact and hands you your order.  Ok, it's counter service, but a couple of signs with arrows and \"Order Here\" or \"Pick up Here\" would be nice guys..  On to the food.  Tried the kimchi fries and duck confit banh.    - The fries were quite nice - a bit soggy (the way I like em) with some pulled pork, cheese, and kimchi toppings. I'd give it a 10/10 except it was way too salty - typical for this type of dish.  So 8/10. - The duck confit banh was even better - nice bun, incredibly soft duck with the consistency of pulled pork.  Was it the best banh I've ever had?  Probably, but only marginally, and since it costs several times more than the $2 jobbies at T&T, I can't really give this a 10.  Score 9/10.  Overall I don't think I'm as blown away by this place as many other people.  Sure, it's good, and sure, I'd go again if in the area and feeling like banh.  But would I go out of my way to bring people here that are visiting the city?  That's ultimately the question I ask myself, and in this case, I can't see making a trip just for this place.  Very good, but not an earth-shattering experience.  Update 9/30/13: Just realized I reviewed the wrong location - oops!  This review is for the Yonge Street location, not the one on Queen West."}
{"text":"This place is freaking amazing.  When we started ordering it was hard to stop, so it seemed like we ended up eating half the menu between my wife and I.  Pork belly banh mi blew my mind -- enough said.  And the tacos, the chapati-like tortilla they use is ridiculous.    Pork belly and kalbi were our top picks over the squid and panko tofu.  I've had other versions of kimchi fries in Chicago and LA, and the one here is my favorite.  Probably because of the healthy dose of pulled pork it's served with.  Creative, excellent food for cheap -- what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"My gf and I were craving some banh mi and heard of a place called banh mi boys. We decided to make a drive down and check it out and it did not let us down.  I ordered the beef cheek banh mi, Kali taco, pork belly steamed bao and kimchi fries (ya I'm a fat kid eh lol). Everything was delicious and I love the twist they put on the traditional Vietnamese sandwich.  You can ask for it spicy so I added red chillies, ya they burned going down.  All in all it was a great experience and the decor inside was really cool."}
{"text":"This place recently came to Y&E and it's awesome!! I have had the pork belly bao ($4.00) and the fried chicken bao ($4.00) and they are both super yummy! They have the best sauces!! I have also had their sweet potato fries & garlic mayo. Everyone at my work is obsessed with this place,and always going for lunch. The prices are very reasonable. The portions are perfect. The baos are snack sized,and the bahn mis are meal sized. The service is speedy and efficient. The decor is fun and the vibe is friendly. There is a good amount of seating in the restaurant."}
{"text":"this place is amazing if you're looking for a quick bite and cheap price. got the braised beef on the steamed bao that was more like a steamed cloud of deliciousness, basically brisket. Also got the kalbi soft taco which was amazing, very Korean BBQ tasting. will definitely be back. total cost was under $8."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled pork banh mi and fries and it was great! There was little to no wait, it was very affordable, and had great portions.  The banh mi was fresh and had such a great scent that when I was chilling with some friends they all asked where I got it. At $5.50, it doesn't break the bank and I was full before I got to the fries.  The fries were fresh, but you've got to eat them immediately or they get soggy but still good.  Definitely coming back some time soon."}
{"text":"We had almost skipped this place due to roads closing but good thing that we had decided to walk!! It's definitely worth trying this place. I can say that this was the BEST pork belly bahn mi that I've ever had! The meat was so tender and filled with flavors. As for the bread, it was crunchy and fresh. I was quite disappointed to find out that the mild spicy bahn mi did not come with jalapeños. What kind of bahn mi doesn't have jalapeños?! Although it was a reasonable size, the meat portion was a bit on the less side which was fine for the price. If you're not in a mood for a bahn mi, there are other options to choose from which I'm sure that are as delicious!"}
{"text":"As a viet boy, banh mi is a big part of my diet. Many of my friends recommended my this place and saw the decent reviews on yelp so decided to give it a try.   The banh mi itself was quite good, hard to say if it was the best ever. Definitively on the good side. Unfortunately, I was not hungry when I stopped by there. My friend took the kimchi fries, which he reported to be his favorite plate. Might pass by again to try other flavors when I'll be hungrier!"}
{"text":"Awesome joint for Vietnamese submarine sandwiches. Great if you want a quick, delicious bite on the go! Try the Kimchi Fries. This is coming from a Korean man: it's legit."}
{"text":"I had their kalbi beef and pork belly banh mi, and they are absolutely delicious. Lots of flavours in the food, and the kimchi fries is also a good side dish to share with your friends. Go for a quick bite, and you're full already."}
{"text":"I got a recommendation from a fellow travel blogger about Bahn Mi Boys. I'm very glad I decided to make the trek from my hostel to grab a bite to eat here. The sandwich I got, the grilled pork, was delicious, and huge for the $7 I paid. The restaurant is really small and was quite crowded (all the seats were taken) when I got there, but I'd heard this place was pretty popular so that didn't surprise me. Wish I would have ordered the kimchi fries, but I wouldn't have been able to eat all of that food. Not entirely sure when I'll be back in Toronto but I'll try to hit up Bahn Mi Boys when I'm there."}
{"text":"SO Good. Came with my sister and future bro-in-law and we ordered a variety of things on the menu. Standouts were the pork belly banh mi and the kimchee fries. The banh-mi sandwiches are on perfect french baguettes and I loved the extra cilantro loaded on. Kimchee fries can be best described as a gourmet asian inspired poutine... totally crave-worthy. The portions are really big so come hungry!  The staff are awesome. We met the owner who spoke to us about the inspiration about the concept (his dad has been making traditional banh mi for 40+ years). Really nice to see small businesses taking a risk and doing well on the Queen Street West.  FYI- If you like hot spice, don't bother on the medium flavour- there is no kick there at all."}
{"text":"Pork belly bao with jalapenos is my go-to when eating out! The jalapenos compliment the pork belly, cutting through the oiliness, and the bao is soft."}
{"text":"I checked this place out after seeing the hype on yelp, and it wasn't that great in my opinion. Kimchi fries was kinda weird, wasn't sure if i liked it or not. The sandwich was also lacking in flavour, I got their 5 spice pork belly. Don't think I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"Banh mi boys is so yummy!  I have been here a few times and this place never fails me!! Consistent, fast and super satisfying. I am always super full after a banh mi boys meal! Even if it is out of my way, I'll come here before heading home.. Every time I come here, I would get a banh mi and the oooh so good kimchi fries! The fries are so tasty no matter how unhealthy it sounds... You have to try if you haven't! The pork belly Bao is really good as well but for some reason I usually opt for the banh mi.   There is also a second location now, which I have been meaning to try. I'm sure it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants at yonge & eg. The food is always fresh and hot. I love everything on their menu."}
{"text":"If you are craving a delicious juicy meat sandwich with wonderful flavours, this is the place! It's a tiny little joint with ok priced delicious Viet sandwiches and buns. Food is fresh, quick and hot for a good price"}
{"text":"3 stars may be slightly controversial however this type of sandwich just really isn't my style or to my tastes. That being said many people I know are down right obsessed with Banh Mi!  Not a big fan of the bread, coriander overload but the fries are pretty tasty. I wouldnt avoid it based on my review, its not my taste. I much prefer my sandwiches to be hearty with, meat, sharp cheese, and honey mustard. Yum..."}
{"text":"As mentioned by several others, the kimichi fries are a must try - at least once anyways. It is a little pricey but it is good! It wouldve been better with cheese as I've previously tried at other restaurants. I also order the duck confit banhmi and it was okay. There's a lot of filling which is great. For the price of the banhmi here, it could be cheaper going elsewhere down in Chinatown. The banhmi size is pretty large so be sure to be on an empty stomach! Service is pretty good considering all of the busy customer traffic. Probably takes around 10 minutes to get your food.   I probably wouldn't come back since banhmi can be way cheaper elsewhere."}
{"text":"Kimchi fries are beyond amazing. My husband is absolutely obsessed with this little spot, and here's why:  -It's pretty cheap - we can both eat for less than $15 (and it's a million times better than any fast food anywhere) - It doesn't taste cheap - ingredients are all fresh, bao's are loaded with fresh veggies & cilantro - Kimchi fries are a must try, they are sort of like fusion poutine. I always ask for extra garlic mayo, and the friendly staff is always obliging.   I've tried the pork bao, it's also excellent, as well as the fried chicken bao (pretty good).  Next time (likely this weekend), I am going to try an actual bahn mi.  If you need extra sauce, just ask when you are getting your food. They are usually pretty happy to load on the mayo/luck sauce/anything you ask for.  We usually try and stop every time we are in the area, it's totally addictive.  If you're visiting Toronto, you MUST do a 'cheap eats' stop here! - Eaton Centre location is also excellent."}
{"text":"There was a bit of line up during lunch hour but staffs were all really nice.  I had five spices pork belly Banh Mi and it was quite nice. Only downside of the place is its too small and there is not much of space for eat or line up. I will definitely going back there to try their steam bun tho."}
{"text":"I live in the Queen West area, and this is my go-to! Delicious every time. I normally get the bahn mi when I'm really hungry, and the tacos and/or bao when I'm looking for a snack. Sometimes, I'll get all three... just because it is all so delicious! I highly recommend- no matter what hunger level."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the food I would give it a lower rating. Food is good.  Service was good except the girl working the register.  She looked annoyed and looked like she didn't care to be there.  No eye contact. Pork belly bao and banh mi on point.  I'd still go back."}
{"text":"I use to LOVE this place.   They use to be off the wall delicious...over the years their quality went down a bit, I think they are still awesome, just not as good as it once use to be.     For example when I use to have their fried chicken bao it use to be actual juicy hunks of fried chicken.   Now .....the fried chicken just looks like deep fried chicken breast burgers cut in half.  I mean....still good, and priced well, just not as tasty as they use to be.     Their pulled pork kimchi poutine use to be filled with pulled pork and kimchi, now they are a lot less generous.     I mean it's the sign of the times I guess, they raised their prices a bit but not by a lot, and I still love to go there for a quick lunch once in awhile.....I just don't crazy crave them as I use to in the past."}
{"text":"Love it here!  I really can't say enough great things about this place, awesome food, comfortable atmosphere and delicious flavors with every bit."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for awhile, its nice to see a place like this near Yonge & Eglington area. Good food, good prices and good selection. Definitely a place to try more than once."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious and cheap! My friend and I decided to drop by after getting Kekou Gelato next door and we were surprised by how big the portions were! Everything on the menu is pretty much under $10 but it's surprisingly filling. We both got a steamed bao each and shared the tofu kimchi fries and we couldn't even finish. The panko tofu steamed bao comes with pickled veggies and a piece of crispy tofu and it was so delicious (I've eaten a lot of fried tofu dishes and this is one of the best I've had!) However, the kimchi fries was probably the best part. The fries tasted fresh, the kimchi is super flavourful but not overbearing, and the sauces/mayo that comes with it compliments the kimchi so well. Also for the price, the portion is really generous! I would definitely return just to get the kimchi fries."}
{"text":"The steamed buns of the sandwiches are unreal!!! Enjoyed it more than what was inside the sandwich (had beef one). Also the Kimchi fries were pretty awesome.  Great for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I wonder why I don't come here more often.   The kimchi fries are my fave thing on the menu. The bao are good too. I don't really get the bahn mi much because I prefer the classic $2 bahn mi you get at viet places in east/chinatown. But as a sandwich place in Downtown Toronto, Bahn Mi Boys is where it's at. Flavour and price-wise.   It can get a little busy but they're still pretty quick all things considered. Dining in is a bit noisy so might not be great for long heartfelt chats."}
{"text":"It has been so long since I've had good banh mi - needless to say I was excited to try this place when I got into Toronto. After a long day of traveling, heading to Banh Mi Boys was a welcome reward.   I ordered the lemongrass tofu sandwich with jalapenos, and made sure to get some sweet potato fries as well. The sandwich was good, though I was so hungry it could have tasted like cardboard and I would have eaten it. The lemongrass tofu was a great addition that I had not tried before (in the past I generally order veggies only). The sauce made the sandwich a little soggy, but I ate the sandwich so fast that it didn't matter. The sweet potato fries were good, but a little salty. They came with mayo, which I did try, but was not a huge fan of. Usually I prefer ranch dressing or ketchup with my fries, but I figured I would give it a shot.  The location was pretty convenient since it was near the hotel I was staying in, and the area seemed to have a lot of cool shops and restaurants. As my first food experience in Toronto, I say this was a good choice."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick bite at a low cost? Banh Mi Boys is it! Lots of options that are both tasty and filling. Their five spice pork belly and fried chicken steamed baos are bomb. Kimchi fries were surprisingly good too. The tacos aren't that bad either ^^"}
{"text":"4-4.5 Stars  My boyfriend and I recently came to Toronto for a little Labor Day weekend holiday. Banh Mi Boys was highly rated on Yelp so we knew we had to stop by here sometime, as we both love banh mi, and the different variations of it. When we arrived, there wasn't that much of a line/wait, although there are only a few seats. I ordered the kalbi beef banh mi while my boyfriend had the pork belly banh mi. It was a bit of a wait, as they seem to make each order one at a time, but we were both really excited. The price seems to be a little high (I paid about $13 for both sandwiches only), but similar to NYC prices. We split both of our banh mis, so we were able to try both. While I enjoyed my banh mi, I felt that it didn't have nearly enough kalbi beef. Instead, it tasted more like kimchi, which was slightly disappointing. However, we both loved the pork belly banh mi, and agreed that it was the best. We compared the sandwiches to a similar sandwich shop here in NYC (JoJu), which we love. Hopefully next time we're in the area, we'll try the kimchi fries."}
{"text":"Hell yeah kimchi fries!!  Banh Mi Boys' spin on the Vietnamese sandwich and other such comforts is well recognized in the city's food scene. I'd just wish this second location conveniently close to Ryerson had opened when I was at Ryerson--I'd come here instead of spending my lunch money on hot dogs.   I find this place less busy than the original Queen/Spadina location."}
{"text":"Had a friend who was from out of town and wanted to take her to Khao San Road but I discovered that it's closed on Sundays, and so we wandered around until we ended up here.  Luckily we managed to beat the crowd that started pouring in here shortly after noon, so we go out orders in and managed to score some seating (which is definitely in short supply).  I tried the braised beef, the five spice pork belly bao, and the veggie kim chi fries.  I quite liked the pork belly bao and was surprised by how irresistible the fries were.  I asked for everything max. spicy so I was quite pleased by the plethora of thai chilies.  A good find!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here regularly when I was at Ryerson. I've ordered on Foodora a few times lately. It's still delicious and great value. On a sidenote, the quality of the kimchi fries might have slipped slightly... Or it could be that I'm just over the kimchi fries thing and I can't handle junk food the way I used to."}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced.  $6 on average for a Vietnamese sub, and then some.  These are usually $1-$2 elsewhere, notably at Chinese supermarkets or Vietnamese supermarkets.  What they have going for them are the kimchi fries that should only be consumed fresh and on the spot and the freshness of the sub as well as the hot meats/vegies in the sub. But, if you were to venture to say, Nguyen Huong Bakery over by Spadina, you can get the same thing for about $2 with your own oven at home!  I get it - this places fills a niche with the uninitiated and non-Asian crowd but for the initiated folks, we know where to go for cheaper Vietnamese subs that more or less tastes the same.  Banh Mi Boys is worth trying at least once though to see what the hype is all about."}
{"text":"I typically am not a huge fan of bahn mi---but these were AMAZING!!  Yes it is worth the hype!!  We got the grilled pork made spicy--which included some peppers.  We also got the pork belly steamed bao.  They were both super good!!  This place gets packed, so you can also just get it to go and eat outside :)"}
{"text":"For a place named \"Banh Mi\" I expected them to serve a good banh mi. Not the case at all. It's a fast food take on the real thing (isn't a banh mi already a street food to begin with??).   I had the chicken Banh mi. The best part of it was the carrot slaw. The bun was an ultra-soft and pasty sub roll, not a baguette. Really disappointing. The chicken was not char grilled either. This place doesn't have any authenticity. Don't trust the raving reviews."}
{"text":"Kalbi beef taco-- HOW CAN $3.99 BE THIS GOOD?  Girl I sat across from was eating a grilled chicken sandwhich; she said last time she had the pork, (which kind?) and it was better, juicier.  Thus, my advice: stick to meals that once had hooves."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but it didn't quite meet my expectations.  I love banh mi and always get it from Chinatown, so when I heard about this place I couldn't wait to try their different fillings. I ordered the pulled pork and duck confit and both were non-impressive. The flavour combination just didn't work for me.  My other friends ordered the beef cheek and kalbi beef.  They too are banh mi experts and were not impressed either.  We also got their kimchi fries.  Again this was something I was really looking forward to eating but it too feel short of expectations.  The fries were way too soggy.  Granted they added kimchi too them, which will make anything soggy, but if they change their fries I think they will have something there.    I will probably be back to try their other flavours and hopefully that will change my mind, but for now it's only 2 stars."}
{"text":"My husband had been talking about coming here for a while, so we finally decided to hit it up yesterday.   We ordered the Five Spice Pork Belly, which is braised pork belly with pickled radish served on a baguette with mayo, pickled carrots, cilantro and cucumber.   The whole affair came in at a \"whopping\" six bucks - basically unheard of when it comes to an epic meal for two in Toronto's downtown core. One sandwich was more than enough to satisfy two massive appetites.   The staff was lovely, the vibe was great and the restaurant was spotlessly clean. Can't find much better for a late-afternoon lunch on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Wait times are getting quite long. I waited almost 25 mins for two steamed baos and Kim chi fries."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I grab the Kimchi fries and Club Bao. I know I should try the other items on the menu, but how can I do so when the 2 are just sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Spectacular. I'm not a sandwich kind of guy, but sometimes I try to surprise myself, and this time it was worth it. I had the 5 spice belly pork banh mi with mayo and it blew me away. Maybe it's because I've only had one other banh mi my entire life so I'm a bit of a banh mi noob, but whatever. Also I know that in China Town, the banh mi is $2.50, so maybe $5.50 seems steep, but I was more than happy to pay that for an excellent outstanding sandwich."}
{"text":"Saw this place on that TV show and wanted to give it a go... I had the beef cheek sandwich and it was fantastic!  Very tender and flavourful beef and the bread was very good.  Definitely need to go back to try the Kalbi sandwich!"}
{"text":"Tasty af bao! We took the braised beef banh mi but with no veggies and it was only meeh. We didn't like it that much. Maybe it'll be better if we take it with veggies. But u had it with someone picky who doesn't like carrots.  The taco was a grilled chicken one. It was alright. Not bad, I might take it once in a while but it's not a must. I didn't expect it to be spicy because we asked for not spicy. But it wasn't that spicy either. It also has kimchi in it.  Our favourite was the baos! We got it in braised beef by accident. I ordered a pulled pork but got beef instead. I really loved it! The bread was so soft and fluffy! Almost like marshmallow but not sweet!  My boyfriend read some reviews while we ate and went back to order their bestseller, the five spices pork bao. God, that was out of this world! It was fat, like really fat but so good omg!   Definitely suggest the five spice pork bao!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Been here a few times now and really enjoy the food and they have great, friendly customer service. I use the Ritual app to place my orders and it is super quick."}
{"text":"I went here with a bunch of friends and we absolutely loved it. I had the braised beef banh mi with kimchi fries on the side. The braised beef was super delicious and went really well with the vegetables and the bun. Even though this item is available in most banh mi shops, something about this one tasted better. The kimchi fries were amazing as well and come in a big portion, definitely worth the price. I also tried some of the sweet potato fries that my friend ordered and of course I liked them too.   Just as a heads up, don't order any sides if you're already ordering a banh mi. I made this mistake and ended up wasting some food because I couldn't finish everything all at once. If you want a taste of everything, split a banh mi with a friend."}
{"text":"I'm always passing by this place thinking oh I need to try this place, and today ended up being the day!  Luckily it wasn't too packed so I was able to get a seat in this small place.  It's a Vietnamese sandwich place that is small on space but big on taste!  I ordered the braised beef sandwich and was surprised it was only $5.99!  It was on a baguette with some carrots and comes with a side of cucumber cilantro kinda slaw but not really a slaw but has a nice fresh crunch to it!  The beef was nicely tender and flavourful.  I'm upset I haven't tried this place before - all the opportunities to have good cheap that I missed!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good. Weekday lunch (12pm) waiting times were pretty long, but the delicious food made the wait worth it.  I ordered the classic Grilled Pork Banh Mi with a side of Kimchi Fries (split with a friend). The combination was super filling and we had a hard time finishing all our food! The sandwich consisted of crispy bread paired with pickled vegetables and well-seasoned meat. And I liked that the kimchi taste in the fries was not overpowering, but complimented the fries very well.   I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful grub. The kimchi fries are insanely amazing and I could eat on the weekly."}
{"text":"The food here is always soooooooo good and it's nice to see there's always people in here from open to close! Fried chicken bao and kalbi beef tacos are my fav!"}
{"text":"Food is tasty and decent prices. I have to admit I was hesitant to try vietnamese & Korean fusion, but it works. The kimchi fries are a must!  Would definitely go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about banh mi boys. My go to place in the area for sure. Pork belly banh mi is to die for and the kimchi fries are mouthwatering from start to finish. Just amazing. Wow."}
{"text":"Bahn Mi boys have big plans for their little sandwich shop! Taking the place of a rather dilapidated Shwarma place, they've pretty much kept everything as is (for now!).  They have a very small menu (5 or 6 items only) but they're incredibly great tasting and made fresh! Served on a nice soft bun (rather than the hard baguettes they're served in other places), they still kept the unique bahn-mi flavour, added some great meat to it and still kept the prices relatively low (around $5 for a 'gourmet' bahn-mi sandwich that should fill up a good portion of your stomach).  I would be a little disappointed of the space but I overheard one of the owners speaking of what they're planning to do with the space (move the kitchen to the back, renovate the space, etc) and it should be a pretty great shop once they start going for real!"}
{"text":"pork belly=really good!"}
{"text":"We went to Banh Mi Boys on Saturday, and arrived a minute before 10pm.  I was so grateful that they were still open.  I had the five spice pork belly banh mi, my friend had the grilled chicken banh mi, and we ordered the kalbi taco for good measure.  I can assure you that ordering just a sandwich is enough.  It was delicious.  I was happy. they also had cherry coke and vanilla coke."}
{"text":"Excellent banh mi and bao. I got a grilled pork banh mi and fried chicken steamed bao. Both were full of flavor and filled me up.  I could barely finish the two. The prices were reasonable although slightly higher than where I'm from (Tampa).  But the quality was there and good food is worth paying a premium for.    Great ambience and energy in the place, cool music playing. Definitely a place I would go back to if I visit Toronto again."}
{"text":"So delicious!  Especially the pulled pork fries (poutine).  I always buy an extra couple tacos to take home - they reheat very well (but who is kidding who, they are usually gone within a few hours).  Prices are very reasonable and quality is good. The staff is very friendly and sweet.  Cannot wait for the new location to open up at Yonge and Gerrard!"}
{"text":"Their 5 spices pork belly is my favourite, either with bao or banh mi. But i think the banh mi is worth more because it's only $6, you can eat it twice if it's too much. The thing that I don't like about this location is the place is so small, it's hard to get a seat even though it's not on peak hours, i need to sit with another customer on a very small table. I hope that they can expand the place!! It would be more comfortable to not sitting very close with each other."}
{"text":"Was visiting Toronto on a business trip and I totally had to check this place out. Went with a chicken and grilled pork bahn mi sandwiches and they were quite good. I thought there was a bit too much bread and not enough filling but that's my hot take on that.  Ingredients were fresh and tasty. Price-tag was a bit high but I guess this is downtown Toronto pricing vs what I have in Montreal.  Food was prepped quickly despite the line-up."}
{"text":"All I have to say about this place is HOLY KIMCHI FRIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i have been waiting a long time for this place to re-open, and then finding the time to come by. I had read somewhere that BMB was only opened until 8, so when working late nights close by, I didn't think I would be able to get these goods. When I finally walked in on Friday night with a pretty big lineup, I was told this place was opened until 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If only I knew about this 2 weeks ago, I would've been here so much sooner.  Reading some other blog, I noticed the kimchi fries was more like a kimchi poutine.... sounds like the weirdest combination ever but I was brave enough to try it. Trust me - you do not need bravery to check this dish out. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but it looks like there is pulled pork / shredded meat, some type of mayo, and a good portion of kimchi to boot... along with fries of course. At first bite, I felt like my tastebuds were flying off the wall. it's sour, it's salty, it's unbelievably delicious! As I am health freak, I am telling you that I've found my weakness. Every bite continued on as I wanted to not share is with S... he wasn't a fan of the kimchi - he's never been but agreed that it was definitely an interesting and worth trying combination.  enough about the KCF .... there is MORE! We also got the Duck Confit Banh mi (the cream of the crop of the sandwiches), the pork belly steamed bao, and a papaya salad (my health kick). The Duck Confit sandwich was for him and it did not disappoint. The baguette was so soft, and the duck reminded me of peking duck stuffed in a sandwich. Wish it was spicier, but really, who cares at this moment when you have so many delicious items ready to be gobbled down. I have been craving the pork belly steamed bao, reading great things, but not knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised that as pork belly, it wasn't overly fatty, but very flavourful. The bao was a great size for me as I think that it is the ultimate snacker if you need a small bite to eat. I asked for extra carrots and a little bit of spice. You definitely get a good kick if you enjoy heat. The bao was sooo yum, but I did not have to enjoy it in a dim sum restaurant, rather the comfort of my own home (as I got takeout!) Lastly the papaya salad,although I was was bigger, was presented with dressing on the side, so it would not get soggy (nice touch). Essentially, if you do not put the sauce on, it's pretty tasteless but refreshing. If you do decide to dress, you will get a sweet and sour type of taste that makes you want to keep eating more of it.  I don't know how to explain it.. one of the best meals at a great price. Yes, we ordered a little too much... but YES it tasted amazing as leftovers the next day.  Banh Mi soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets.  I've had multiple different dishes on multiple different occasions and haven't had a bad meal yet.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ok, quick time.   Food = yeeah baby. I was going for a strollski from Spadina to Ossington and thought why not get like 3 different things and get it over with? So I got the kim chi fries, they come with pulled pork, kim chi, mayo, green onions. The fries were the best part of this - so crunchy and well done. Delicious overall, for 5.99 I wasn't expecting to get pulled pork. CHEAP?!?!  Then I got the five spice pork belly Bahn. The pork belly was amazing, but I thought it was too much bread. I wish I could get a double pork belly in that baguette and then it would be perfect.  I also had the kalbi taco. It was really small, the kalbi wasn't the best. My 3rd favorite out of the three for sure.  Interior = funky, kinda tight because all the tables are taken. A little messy  Staff = super sweet smiley and fast.  Location  =amazing. anything Queen/Spadina and beyond is amazing.  I would go back to try EERRYYYTANG!!! And who are you people kidding, kim chi fries are NOT for sharing. NO NO NO! I ate all that and was just comfortable full.  OMNOMNOMNOM!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! The food is always great, no matter what I decide to try. I have to say that the kimchi fries are my favourite!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Pork belly banh me, the Kalbi beef banh me (both hot and spicy) as well as an order of sweet potato fries.  All of this was ordered via Foodora and delivered hot within 20 minutes.  The banh me was excellent....especially the pork belly!  It's obviously less expensive just to go to the restaurant, but we are on holiday from the states, it was late and we had a long day so the delivery service was a nice alternative.  Wish they had options like this back in Ohio!"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boyz is nice to have small snacks. My favorite item is the braised beef bao and I usually get the kimchi fries for sharing.   Personally I prefer the baos over the banh mi since I love steamed buns. One thing that I don't like about the kimchi fries is that it gets soggy really quickly so I recommend eating it fast.   The service is quick and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! I tried the grilled chicken sub but will try the taco and the bun in the future. They taste so good especially the pickled carrot and radish. The bread is a little bit hard but OK. The place is crowded during lunch time so come early!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile and I was not disappointed. We had and shared the grilled pork banh mi, fried chicken baos and beef tacos. It was all so yummy! I have to say that the fried chicken bao stood out though, it was freaking delicious. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"It's not your traditional banh mi that you'd expect, but it's not as if they're trying to come across as being an actual banh mi place - it's more like their own interpretation of banh mi by incorporating other Asian cuisines. I was hesitant about the idea at first, because Asian fusion isn't really my favourite, but I was surprised at how well all the flavours worked together.  I've ordered a bunch of different banh mih from them and they've all been consistently good, never had a bad experience. The portion of the kimchi fries is quite large and can easily be shared between two people or eaten as an entree. I liked the idea, but wasn't a fan of it - the kimchi itself didn't have enough flavour for me and the sauce from the kimchi kinda just made the fries soggy.  I tried to order something different on my most recent visit - and that's where I was left a bit disappointed. The baos weren't bad, but they weren't as good as the banh mi, probably because there's less room to stuff them so the flavours were kinda just meh. I didn't like the soft taco very much, I found the tortilla a little too thick for my liking and a bit cold.  The price of this place is good (~$10 should fill you up), and their banh mis are solid. I personally thought their baos and the kimchi fries were just ok but would not recommend their tacos."}
{"text":"I love this place! So many flavours in my mouth!! They're very quick with long lineups and takeout is bomb since it's not the biggest space but it feels like asia"}
{"text":"They have such great sandwiches here awesome flavours and ingredients.  Only problem is place is so popular it's rare that it's not packed.  Also which it was open a little later too but hey, those are minor quibbles.  You can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"When using Yelp in some cities, it's not like using it back home sometimes. Home is Jersey...NYC...the tri-state area. Tons of fresh reviews for places. Toronto was not like that. However, this place was on the Toronto top 5 reviewed list and they don't even sell alcohol. That stood out to me.   We parked on the street this place lives on with no intention of coming here. Just to wander around. But then I saw it after walking 50 ft and realized I had bookmarked it on Yelp.  It was fate muthaf****a!!!!!!  That is the only logical and civil explanation.   Right off the bat, I will be coming back here.  The atmosphere was fun...a little small...but we still managed to eat inside despite getting our food to go since we thought we wouldn't have a place to sit.   I got the grilled chicken Vietnamese sandwich...spicy..and it was amazing. The chicken was so good and the hot sauce just made it even gooder.  That is now a word.  It wasn't expensive either and everything is just so chill.  I want to go back and try the fries and maybe even a spicier sandwich."}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for some cheap yet very fresh sandwiches, tacos and steamed sandwiches (not sure how else to describe it). Their specialty is the sandwich which has a long crispy bun and fresh filled ingredients.  Their taco is a soft taco, but not a tortilla - more like a Malaysian roti which was exceptional.  It may take a while for order to be filled since it is freshly made.  There are 5 or 6 tables along the entrance if you don't mind people watching you eat while they wait to order.  I love the tasty food which is consistent. All items on menu are under $10."}
{"text":"It's tasty, but it's also nothing special. Go if you like variety.  The food is different, but not really better."}
{"text":"For a small sandwich, it was quite tasty.  Pretty good grab and go spot.  Prices range from about $3.50 to about $9.  Good selection of sandwiches.  Will be trying them again soon."}
{"text":"I got the 5 Spice Pork Belly Bahn Mi and it didn't dissapoint. Visiting from California and I'm glad I stopped by this small shop! Pricing was decent and I love that they had coke in a bottle available. Only downfall is there's limited places to sit."}
{"text":"The lovely @Imran N invited me to hang out with his friends Ryan and Priyank after Yelp's Grown Up Pizza Party event.  What a delightful surprise. I detect a new love affair. The chicken taco I ordered was delicious, ordering it spicy was the right choice. I had a bite off of Imran's Steamed Bao and OMG - I never would have imagined this delicacy! Next time, you will be mine baby!  The place is a little hole in the way with possibly  only 4-5 tables and an extremely small bar seating area. Keep that in mind when ordering in!  I can not wait to return and introduce this place to others!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the banh mi boys by spadina and was super excited to try this location out as well (Yonge/eglington). Everything tasted fresh and tasty. I ordered the steam bun with panko crusted tofu (it was very flavourful) as well as the jicama&papaya slaw, I loved the spicy dressing (but if your not into spice, alone would've tasted good too). I can't wait to try the Kalbi beef and grilled chicken next..."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I was searching for a good place for bao, and this place was highly rated. Luckily, it was close to Eaton Center so after a quick trip to the mall we went here. My boy friend and I shared the banh mi and bao and it was enough for the both of us. He's never had bao before and actually loved it. The food was absolutely delicious! The prices were reasonable and the food came out hot and quick. Will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Cool, modern atmosphere. Cramped but clean.  This isn't a typical banh mi shop. It's not even all that Vietnamese. More like Asian fusion.  We had the kimchi fries and 5 spice pork banh mi. Both were delicious. Pulled pork was an interesting ingredient in the kimchi fries. I'd rather they went with something that meshed better with the other toppings, like galbi or bulgogi, but it worked well enough. The banh mi had Korean pickled radish and some kind of red sauce (sriracha? Korean chili pepper sauce?) along with the other usual banh mi toppings. This was better than the kimchi fries for me.  All in all an odd but good marriage of flavors in the things I tried, and I''d definitely return to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"The vibe: A busy, bumping, and bustling lunch spot on Queen West. There are usually lines that look daunting and long, but they move quickly so don't give up if you see a lineup to the door.  The food: BANH MI GALORE. If you're not familiar with Banh Mi, it's one of the very few good things that came out of the age of colonization. I'm a politics nerd, so don't even get me started on the turmoil that colonization caused....except in this case, where the French left their mark in Vietnam in the form of a very tasty sandwich. It's a French baguette topped with Vietnamese delights: tofu, pork or chicken with shredded carrots, cilantro, cucumbers and all kinds of tasty sauce. It's a big sandwich and it feels both fresh and substantial all at the same time. I'm a huge fan.  My go to meal: Chicken banh mi. SPICY!   Secret: If you're like me and like to eat all the time, I usually order the papaya salad to go. They put the sauce separately so it's the perfect mid afternoon snack. Fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"So glad we listened to other yelpers! This place is amazing. Not only they had yummy sandwiches, their music is on point! We had banh mi thit nuong and they were very delicious. The size of their sandwiches are pretty big compare to some other banh mi shops I have been to. I also tried their steam bao with bbq pork belly, and that was yummy as well. Next time we visit Toronto, we will definitely return."}
{"text":"pretty darn good bahn mi.  Had the tofu one.  Asked for spicy but no spice to be found.   Kimchee fries were good!  The kimchee was a bit too salty.  This dish is SO baddddd but so good.   Someone needs to do kimchee fries in NYC."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and perfect for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"BMB is often credited for starting the \"bao\" revolution in the great GTA and I concur. I visited this place about a year ago and I have been back countless times (for someone that lives way up in the burbs that is ludacris).  Lunch, afternoon snack, dinner, midnight snack -- any time is BMB time!  Snack size portions (except for maybe their banh mis) and reasonable prices make for a winning combo.  You can't really go wrong with just about anything here but my favourite is by far their five spice pork belly bao; a juicy, tender and flavourful morsel of porky goodness wrapped in a warm and pillowy bao with some pickled veggies that provide the perfect amount of tartness to cut the fattiness.  There is one caveat though; I have recently discovered another joint that makes a meaner bao than BMB. Located right inside the Grange there lies a Mean Bao...  Get your bao on!"}
{"text":"Oh Banh Mi Boys, you make my mouth water just thinking about all the wonderful things that you offer on your menu.  I've had both the Kalbi Beef and Squid Banh Mi and they were absolutely delicious! The Kimchi fries is also a MUST-HAVE! I'm not a fan of kimchi but wow, pair it up with a box full of fries, pulled pork, mayonnaise and green onions, you get this amazing tasty box of goodness. Once you start nomming, you can't stop!   I tried both the Panko Tofu and Pork Belly Bao as well. I really enjoyed the Panko Tofu Bao but the Pork Belly Bao...not so much.   It can get pretty busy during their lunch hours, but if you go at a good time, you won't have to wait at all. There are seats inside but the space is very limited because of how tiny this place actually is.  If you're around the area, definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Delicious, quick and great prices!  What more can you ask for? The Bahn Mi is yummy and a great deal, however it usually fills me up very quickly - and I don't have room for the other things on the menu!  So I usually go with a variety of the other things on the menu - my faves are the Fried Chicken Bao, Pulled Pork Bao and Kalbi Beef Taco.  If you're feeling indulgent and hungry, get the Kimchi Fries .... sooooooo good!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place - and I'm glad I did!   For the past year or so, everyone has been telling me to try this place, however due to previous bad experience with vietnamese sandwiches, it took me a while to get into the mood to explore this place. But wow, it was really good.   I had the fried chicken banh mi sandwich and although the chicken was amazing, I feel in love with something else in the sandwich, something that lifted the entire flavour of the sandwich - Sweet pickled carrots! Lol really. I didn't know their carrots could make such a difference and make the sandwich sooooo yummy. Literally it's so good!  5/5, this place is a winner in my book. I only wish I tried it earlier."}
{"text":"Menu: http://www.banhmiboys.com/menu.htm  What we had:  Banh Mi - Pork belly, kalbi beef, pulled pork, duck confit Taco - kalbi beef Steamed bao - Pork belly, fried chicken, Club (this is from their secret menu, essentially its pork belly + fried chicken in bao) Sides - Kimchi fries  Taste: 9/10  We preferred the steam baos over banh mi and taco as the sandwich of choice.  The banh mi was a little bit tough, and sometimes, you don't get the full taste of the fillings. The tacos are pretty good too, however, they dont have pork belly or fried chicken.  The fried chicken one is Steven's favourite, the meat is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  It is served with a spicy mayo.  However, it can be pretty heavy  The pork belly bao is also highly recommended, it has a juicy piece of pork belly and assorted pickled veges.  Would highly recommend both of these. The beef, pulled pork and duck confit fillings were good, the meat were well seasoned but paled in comparison to the fried chicken and pork belly.  The kimchi fries (which is their supposed biggest hit) were mediocre for us, the fries were kind of dry and soggy (we've tried this several times), the kimchi + mayo + meat did add a good kick, but we will most likely just stick to the baos on our future visits.  Value: 8/10  5-7$ per Banh Mi, 4-6$ per Taco / Steamed Bao, 5-8$ per side dish.  One sandwich + a side or two sandwiches will usually fill us up.  **Average cost per diner: $14 after tax and tip  Service/Convenience: 4/10  Two locations, one at Queen and Spadina, another near College and Yonge.  Might be hard to find for first timers because they have such a small joint.  No parking at all (like most other downtown joints).  Very long line-ups during peak hours (lunch - 11:30 to 2), pretty much impossible to get seating unless you go during the off hours.  Would recommend ordering through Ritual App and picking it up if you plan to go during those times.  Would go back? Yup, regularly for their sandwiches  Would recommend to friend? Yes, great meal for good value, try to avoid the peak hours unless you are ordering and picking up ahead of time.   Similar places: None we know of  **Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Fell in love with it the first time I had it & it's always the go to spot when I want a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Kimchi fries- must try!!   Homey little joint, with limited seating.   Hidden gems on Queens west!  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Interesting to find that Banh Mi Boys is a fusion of Viet & Taiwanese cuisine!  KIMCHI FRIES (with beef) Definitely my favourite out of everything we've ordered. The sauce was really good and I was surprised how yummy the kimchi tastes with fries. A special combination!  PORK BELLY STEAMED BAO I love the bao! This is more of a Taiwanese dish. The pork belly was also very yummy - so fatty but so good.  KALBI BEEF BANH MI Viet buns plus kalbi - good but could use more sauce for the kalbi beef."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here. I've known about Banh Mi Boys ever since I tried their Lucky Red spin-off which shockingly closed after just about six months of operations. I must have been expecting alot out of the flavors for the food here but it didn't really hit the spot. My friend on the other hand liked what he ate which was the Fried Chicken Steamed Bao sandwich, something I had seen offered when I went to Lucky Red. I had the Five Spice Pork Belly Bao with an order of the fries. For some reason, I couldn't get the most out of the flavor from the pork belly. Maybe I wasn't that hungry as it was already around 9pm so maybe that's why my tastebuds couldn't enjoy my order. However, I might have to come back here for a second try."}
{"text":"Great sandwhiches for a good price. Food is always made fresh and tastes great. When it gets busy, be prepared to wait. The waiting system for busy days needs to be improved on, but otherwise its a good place to get takeout."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Wish it was closer to work though or else I'd visit often.  I love the steamed bao with five spiced pork belly.  The portion is perfect for me.  Delicious and just enough to fill my tummy.  The kimchi fries is my fav.  It's so filling it's like a meal, so I normally have to share it with someone."}
{"text":"Loved the food here. had the braised beef and the pulled pork banh mi. yum. The best part of the kimchi fries. never knew it could be so good!! Great price for a full meal (although still more expensive than regular banh mi place but well worth it)"}
{"text":"Must try for vegetarians: panko tofu bao $3.5 (you can substitute bao for taco)   Don't know why it took so long for me to discover these bad boys (see what I did there ;)) but glad I did! I've gone for two weeks straight now ...I may have a slight obsession. They have a good selection of bang mi, bao, and taco. What I like about their taco is that it's thicker than your average taco and almost reminds me of an Asian green scallion pancake but minus the green scallions. Most items range from $3.5 -$7 so perfect place to grab a quick bite without breaking the budget.  Being a pescatarian, I was limited to a few opinions. I ended up ordering the squid taco and panko tofu bao. Both were amazing but I particularly loved the panko tofu. It looked crispy on the outside but as soon as you bite into it, it just melts in your mouth. The flavour combination is perfect and even better with the pickled radish. Writing this makes me want to go back again. You can choose the spice level, there's three in total. If you love spicy like I do, go for the fresh habanero which provides a mild kick without the need to chug water (I would prefer spicier).  They were very accommodating because the second time I went, I asked for the panko tofu to be in the taco instead of the bao which I'd recommend. Only thing I would suggest is having a points card just so I can justify my frequents visits. Definitely check this place out if you're looking for a good and cheap eat."}
{"text":"Banh mi has been a staple of my diet growing up in a Vietnamese household and Banh Mi Boys does the real thing proud. Asian fusion food at its best. I've been here twice, and I wouldn't hesitate to go back again. Service was quick and easy. My favourite is the pork belly banh mi and kimchi fries. With all the meat, I like to balance the meal off with the papaya salad (mind you a sandwich, fries and salad is shared with my hubby). The only reason I didn't give this five stars was because the carrots in the sandwich aren't pickled enough the way a Vietnamese sandwich should be. Minor in the grand scheme of things when you see how Korean Kalbi is perfectly married with cilantro and the carrots in the sandwich."}
{"text":"As a tourist, would say that this is one of the best places I went to during a week long trip. Got kimchi fries and a sandwich on their special bread. Was blown away. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Imagine a Banh Mi sandwhich: awesome and cheap and filled with questionable meat, right? Now imagine a Banh Mi sandwich that is still pretty cheap, but made fresh and out of awesome. That's what Banh Mi Boys is all about. You can get several different sandwiches: Grilled Chicken or Pork, 5 Spice Pork Belly, Veal Meatball, or Spicy Beef. My lunch group tried everything but the Spicy Beef, and we were all quite happy and impressed. They also make tacos and wraps out of Chinese steamed buns, using the same sorts of ingredients that they would put in your sandwich. These also got a thumbs up from my lunch group. This has to be one of the cheapest places to eat at Spadina and Queen, and one of the best. People: do this thing!"}
{"text":"Heard lots of rave reviews. So went there to try it myself. It's a really small and narrow restaurant. So only limited seating. We ordered the Grilled Pork Banh Mi & Pulled Pork Banh Mi. The grilled pork was super yummy. It tasted like Asian Style BBQ Pork with a hint of lemongrass. Pulled Pork was a bit on the dry side, but it was still good!   Would definitely come back to try their other Banh Mi!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice (once back in 2013 or 2014? can't remember) and more recently after a day trek to Fan Expo.  Came here with two friends after walking around the convention all day and decided to come here since one of my friends wanted to try Banh Mi Boys.  I got the pork belly banh mi and it was good amounts of meat with banh mi fillings.  We also got a kimchi fries order to share, but ended up taking that with us later because the banh mi's were more than enough for each person."}
{"text":"Grilled Pork Banh Mi, always a fav.  Watch your change though, almost got short changed today when I gave almost the right amount, the cashier punched in my bill and omitted the change I gave.  Didn't say sorry for the mistake either. :(  Back to the food, I have wanted to try the poutine, though I admit I am not a fan of kimchi in general.  Their fries are amazing.  Next time I might just ask for Fries, mayo and green onions.    The pork was very tender, but I wasn't a fan of the spices."}
{"text":"Bahn Mi Boys is the best cheap eats joint in the city. Hands down. Either location is perfection. I've never been let down by anything I eat here and honestly, I would probably pick this place over any fine dining restaurant. I love this place so much that I brought my partner of 3 years here on our very first date. We still come here every two weeks or so.   My favourite items include:  - Kimchi Fries: the OG of all fries. Forget poutine. Seriously. These fries will blow your mind. A generous helping of kimchi and pulled pork, slathered in mayo and topped on fries that somehow never get soggy. It's perfect.  - The Grilled Pork Bahn Mi: perfect sandwich. This sandwich was my first Bahn Mi Boys love. It's my classic go-to. Thick baguette bread filled with delicious pork, pickled veggies (probably my fave part, they really balance out the heaviness of the other components) and addictive sauces. I think this also comes with mayo. I literally add their mayo to everything, so if I'm wrong and mayo isn't the default...ADD MAYO!   - Every Steamed Bao: they are all awesome. Seriously. The soft steamed buns are like clouds. My favourite is probably the Fried Chicken Bao and the Pork Belly Bao...but if you can't decide between the two, get the secret menu item: The Club Bao. This is a combination of the fried chicken and the pork belly all in one. As I mentioned before, if it doesn't come with mayo, definitely add mayo. It just adds a little something-something.   I've also tried an assortment of their tacos. They are also good, but in my opinion, nothing beats the items I listed above!"}
{"text":"Their chicken bao was really great! Nice vibes! This place is much better in the summer!"}
{"text":"Fully expected Bahn Mi Boys to be \"all hype\", but I finally ventured here today and was pleasantly surprised to find my assumptions were wrong.  I tried 1 Kalbi Beef taco and 1 Pork belly bao. Came to around $8.50 with tax and was an adequate food portion for a complete meal.   Ingredients were fresh, presentation was nice, taste was great!   I will definitely return to try other options.  This place is very busy. I waited about 5 minutes to order and maybe 2-3 more minutes to get my food, so overall the line moved quickly and they seem to have everything under control.  There is definitely not enough seating so be prepared to take your food elsewhere to eat."}
{"text":"Spent just under $20 to get Bao Pork Belly, Kimchi Fries, Bao Pulled Pork and two cans of coke.  Friendly service, fast and best bang for your buck.  Went back for some more on the same day to take home for family.  I will definitely go back to eat here again.  Just beware of the tight space inside. The place is cramped but I didn't go there for the elbow room."}
{"text":"The food is just OK. I ordered 2 Banh Mi, one pork (tasty average) and one Kalbi (salty), the bread are not crispy."}
{"text":"Finally!! I've been meaning to try this place since it was featured on \"You Gotta Eat Here\". That's right, featured on Food Network!  You can Google that if you want.   I had a taco and two baos. I was stuffed! When I was looking at pictures of the bao on yelp, I'm thinking it's probably small, plus it's only $3.50, it has got to be so small! I was hungry, so I got three items.  While waiting, a girl walked down with her tray of bao and I realized I ordered too much lol. Don't get me wrong, the bao isn't ginormous. It's about the size of a baseball, but it is a lot more filling than  you'd think! By the time I had two baos, I was done!   I got a tofu bao and I'm glad I did. At first I was reluctant because sometimes, the way tofu is cooked doesn't allow me to enjoy the food. This one, it was golden! They must have used medium firm. It wasn't tough, but it wasn't mush to the bite. I preferred it over my beef bao, which is something I didn't expect.   I also enjoyed the kalbi taco a lot. The sauce was good and the kalbi was cooked well. It was perfect! I think next time I'll try the chicken.   One last note, I was walking around Yonge and Eglinton and I saw a space with the Bahn Mi Boys sign, it's about to open. Yay for more locations!  I would keep coming back to this place!   Good food, good price, what's not to like.   Oh, it does get packed at times, to a point of no seating, so that's a heads up."}
{"text":"Friday, at 3:30pm I had my food within 5 minutes.  Because I went back outside to hang with my (loud barking) dog, they were kind enough to bring it out to me when it was done. This is something I reeeeally appreciate.   +1   I have to be honest, and say I've been avoiding this place due to the feedback I've read and heard; HUGE LINEUPS, so I felt super lucky that when I walked in, they were almost empty, and the sweet girl at the cash was patient whiel I asked a few questions, including what she recommend. The best part? She actually recommended a few items!!!  Finally. Employees that actually know the menu.  +1  NOTE: I opted for take out, so I will be basing my review on what I see when I open my food after a 2 block walk home.  WHAT I GOT:  Kimchi Fries 5.99 OH. MY. LORD. I'm not a very articulate food writer, so I'll just say these are amazing.  AH-MAZING.   Pulled Pork Taco. #3.99 Initial reaction when I opened it's neat little wrapper: it's smaller than I thought it would be, but not so small that it's not a meal in itself. I'm used to seeing massive tacos, which aren't necessarily awesome.  The first thing I noticed was the FRESH FRESH ingredients. The cilantro is amazing. I love cilantro with a passion, so this is the first thing i tasted when I had my first bite.  Everything on this little soft shell 'taco' is fresh; fresh carrots thinly sliced, red cabbage in thin slices, and nothing outweighs the other. The pork is super tender and it goes together like a perfectly bundled gift.  This, my friends is a gift. This little special taco of perfection. I got mine 'mild'; i'll assume they offer it in a spicier if you asked.  BONUS!! They have Cherry Coke AND Vanilla Coke! another +1  I'll be back. And to be perfectly honest, I'd probably even wait in line for food this good. I HATE line ups ... but this place? I'd have to say it's worth it."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm...Banh Mi Boys. So good and so cheap. Their menu is short and simple which makes it uncomplicated compared to most Asian restaurants. The pork belly baos are my favourite - so succulent and tasty. The kimchi fries are always delicious and shareable. And I don't even like kimchi! I also like their fried chicken baos. Much yum.  I wish they would make the place less narrow though. The restaurant feels like a narrow hallway but it would have been nice with more dine-in space. And beware coming here on a weekday during lunchtime - you'll likely have to wait around 30 minutes as service is pretty slow and tons of people come here."}
{"text":"After hearing such amazing things about this place, I decided to give it a try after a day out and about in the area.  I had their kimchi fries and wow! I loved them. Their portion sizes are big as well.  Kimchi fries are definitely worth a try,"}
{"text":"I've tried everything here and they all meet expectations [except for the tofu bao, it is a bit lacking]. The only issue I have is the pickled veggies they use aren't 'pickle-y' enough. Maybe to avoid the smell.. but still that's the only thing I have an issue with and I have eaten here maybe 20+ times.   Just go... every day...  Fried chicken bao is freaking amazing"}
{"text":"Banh mi, steamed Bao buns, tacos, and kimchi fries add up to an awesome menu. This is Asian fusion done right, imo. You can get a meal for sub-$10, which is fantastic for a place this good.   Back when I was working in the area, the staff knew me!  Get the club sandwich from the secret menu :D  My only complaint is that the seating here is usually worse than at the other location."}
{"text":"Great food at an amazing price! The service is usually very fast. The last time I went, I got a five spice pork belly with kim chi fries. The kim chi fries are a must for every meal :) I ate this for dinner and it was enough food to keep me full all night!"}
{"text":"Found this place because of Yelp- and it did not disappoint. We had the pork banh mi and it was AMAZING! The place is Super small!! The ingredients were super fresh, loved the lemon grass. And the roll was toasted perfectly. I wish there was one here back home in buffalo!"}
{"text":"YES. AWESOME. TASTY.  I ordered the grilled pork banh mi and a braised beef bao.   service was quick for a 20-person queue. it probably took me 15 minutes all in to get my lunch.  the food is delicious and very reasonably priced. this is a great lunch choice."}
{"text":"Very efficient and friendly service! Banh Mi Boys never disappoints. I find them perfect for lunch time. I paired grilled chicken Banh Mi with sweet potato fries and it was perfect. I'll usually get the kimchi fries if I'm with a friend because the portion is too big for one. A bonus for this time's visit: I was short on time and wanted to run to Starbucks across the street. Starbucks took longer than usual and when I came back the cashier actually remembered by name. She called out my name as I rushed by her and gave me my order. Awesome service!"}
{"text":"Very good place I came here and they have these puffy bread which are so good and I will recoment as they are good price as well. I tried the normal sandwiches as well I am not as big as fan of them as they full the sandwatch with carrots. But the place is nice and they have special topping. The fries are good too. The service is unique which makes the place special. It is busy in general."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food and a good spin of banh mi's in general. I tend to order the Bao's as I can order two different proteins (pork belly and fried chicken!).     Great that they give you an opportunity to adjust the spice level or even get what they refer to as a \"club banh mi\" which is chicken and pork together!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to eat here a while and until recently it didn't happen. I have also tried to write a review for this place for over a week now, but every time I tried to, I simply had to dash out, jump on the street car and have some Steamed Bao and bring some Kimchi fries home- then of course forget about writing a review.  As a Korean I am biased and believe Kimchi is good  with EVERYTHING-and now I have no doubt in my mind that its true.  I loooove the Bao and how the fluffy mixes with cilantro and sends my taste buds soaring high and bursting with happiness. They are the PERFECT thing for when snack/not-hungry-but-can-nibble craving hits. The location is a perfect stop over while waiting for the ever-so-expensive-but-only-gets-slower public transit. Thankfully, it's very good to my wallet also, which really isn't that great because I can't seem to say NO when I see the signage on my way home.  I really must try other things on menu; no time like the present to try! see you laterz!"}
{"text":"Wow,what an amazing place. Had the five spice pork belly bahn mi. It was truly amazing, one of the best sandwich spots in Toronto. Prices are awesome too. Will try their entire menu in future visits."}
{"text":"Basically you choose from steamed bun, sandwich bread, or tacos.  You then get beef,pork or chicken in them.  They always put pickled vegetables in them and some of them have kimchee.   I got the steamed bao with the five spiced pork.  It was really good.  I liked the picked vegetables and the pork is a round piece of meat and really tasty.  It was really cheap($3.75).   We also got the beef with taco($4).  It's not like the Mexican burrito wraps.  It's much thinner and tasted much better.  The beef was tasty and they put kimchee on all their tacos so if you don't like kimchee, make sure you tell them not to include them.  Even their mild was quite spicy.  Overall, the food was good and cheap.  We were not that hungry so after 1 of each we were full.  This place is cheaper than McDonalds or even the hot dog stand outside and the food is really good.  This is a nice introduction to Korean food for most people in this area.  Not sure if they can survive paying the rent in this area at their prices."}
{"text":"mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm kimchi fries!!! om nom nom nom nom!! kimchi fries & chicken banh mi w/ jalapenos!"}
{"text":"It is cheap and cheerful but totally over-hyped. Very slow service, and food was average at best. The braised beef banh mi was just OK. I also tried the kimchi fries which were barely edible, just a room-temperature soggy saucy mess. On a late Sunday afternoon it will \"cure what ails you\", but I left with unfulfilled expectations."}
{"text":"I'm not generally a big fan of sandwiches but I was meeting my husband for a quick bite to eat on a weekday and suggested Banh Mi Boys because I wanted to see what the hype was all about (he had already tried and loved it).   I arrived around 2 PM on a Friday and there was a long line of people waiting. Once I got to the front, I ordered a pork belly and a duck confit banh mi, both prepared spicy. Wait time after that was moderate but acceptable for freshly prepared food.  The pork belly was super tender and oh so delicious (love me a pork belly). I also really enjoyed the fresh and pickled veggies that came generously piled on the sandwich. I also had a bite of the duck confit sandwich which. although saltier, delicious too.  Surprisingly friendly service despite the crush of people and reasonable prices. Will definitely be back to try the fries and steamed buns."}
{"text":"THE FOOD  -- Five-spice pork belly steamed bao --  A nice thick slab of pork belly to satisfy fatty meat lovers (aka people who know how to eat). Tasty, but didn't totally blow me away, which kind of surprised me because pork belly is *the* traditional Chinese steamed bao filling. I expected the pork to be a bit more tender and a bit more flavourful. Regardless, a really nice fix for pork lovers.  -- Fried chicken steamed bao -- Now, now. This was some good stuff. The fried chicken portion was generous; a nice big juicy chunk o' chicken. So tender and so flavourful. A really nice spin on the traditional steamed bao. This is a must-have.  ***Note: This place has the heat factor down; when they ask if you want your food spicy, they mean it. You get to pick jalapenos, Sriracha sauce, and/or Thai chilis. Oh baby! Finally! A place that takes their heat seriously! Those Thai chilis will satisfy any heat lover. Thank you, BMB for actually carrying through when you ask if I wanted my food spicy.   SERVICE  Nothing to complain about. All all. The kitchen staff making my food were friendly and seemed totally relaxed. With a kitchen that is almost entirely open to the view of customers, it's not always pleasant to stand in front of a kitchen team that displays their level of stress. Thank you, BMB, for not making me feel awkward and/or guilty about my food purchase!  VERDICT  Gotta go back to try more items from the menu. Can't wait."}
{"text":"Affordable Viet sandwiches perfect for lunch or a small dinner (depending on how much you order). Personal favourite is the kimchi fries and grilled pork bahn mi. Only $5.50 for the sandwich! There aren't many places to sit in here, so I usually take mine to go to eat at the office or at home. Spicy mayo is a must!"}
{"text":"I'm happy to say I've finally tried Banh Mi Boys last night! I don't even like banh mi, but Banh  Mi Boys definitely takes the meaning of the cold Vietnamese sandwich to a whole other level, throwing in other Asian influences as well.   By recommendation, we got the Kalbi Banh Mi - the kalbi was so good, I love the flavor, texture and cut of the beef. It went well with the baguette and cold toppings and medium hot sauce.   Pork Belly Bao - I love this soft bun with a touch of sweetness! While the pork belly was not as soft or fatty/melt-in-you-mouth as I imagined, the flavor of the pork was good (a bit burnt on the edges) and paired with the cucumber, carrots, radish(?) and cilantro. Baos are only $3.49!  Beef Cheek Bao - the beef cheek is sort of like Taiwanese beef brisket. It was good but definitely I like pork belly was better in terms of overall flavor and how it tied together with other ingredients as a whole. Also wish the bun was warmer (don't know if it is made cold or just got cold)  Kimchi Fries - I'm a huge fries addict..and I dug right into this! The fries are so good and hot (temperature wise) on the inside!!  A slight crisp with some skin left on. Paired well with the mayo and green onions.. There's also pulled pork and spicy kimchi.   Overall, definitely try this out! My favorites are kalbi, kimchi fries and pork belly bao. Next time I will try the kalbi taco!!"}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Queen West, this installation of the franchise seems like it's busy period is pretty much 24/7. Doing what would best be described as mainstream Vietnamese, they still manage to keep things authentic as far as most of the food goes.   I've been once. I had two sandwich's: The braised beef cheek and the grilled chicken. I'm more of a beef guy, but I found it was a bit dry. Still good, not too spicy even though I asked for spice, and the bread was fresh. The staff was friendly, but they either need to get a new toaster for the bread or just not do it because it takes a bit too long. The toasting does add a nice element to the overall flavor though, so maybe just turn up the volume? The second sandwich I had was the best one. The chicken was grilled and to perfection. Juicy and flavorful, and cooked exactly as it should be. The sauce and veggies compliment it well. Great sandwich.  Friend got the kimchi fries. These are otherworldly is their awesomeness. And I don't even like kimchi, normally. Just stupendously good. Filling enough to be a meal on their own, and if they were all you'd eat you'd be happy.   The sandwich's are a bit pricey if you compare them to other banh mi, but the ingredients are of the pricier type as well. Grilled chicken costs more than assorted cold cuts do, so jumping from $3 to $6-7 makes sense. It's also in a higher rent class than the strip on Spadina.  Good food, clean comfortable setting. Try it out!"}
{"text":"So happy to see that BMB is still doing well!! My husband and I recently visited Toronto after a 5-year hiatus (we live in the states) and of course, we had to hit up BMB again.   Don't judge us, but we spent over $40 for fast food for just the two of us. The kimchi fries were still bomb. The kalbi banh mi was still excellent, although I've had better baguettes. The pork belly bao still rivals many restaurants'. Also tried the duck confit salad and the fried squid taco - both fantastic.  I always recommend BMB to any friends visiting Toronto. Please open a location in the US... in my hometown Boston :)"}
{"text":"We got the sandwich that has fried chicken and pork in it, was super delicious, probably the best Vietnamese sandwich I ever had.   The kimchi fries is okay, the fries in it looked blackened and unfresh. It didn't taste that good to me.   But the sandwiches they have, 100% I recommend!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere It's a short walk from the mall, which makes it so convenient! Great spot to grab food and eat in or to go.   Food I wasn't too amazed by Banh Mi Boys, as all the rave about this spot made me expect a lot more. We ordered a pulled pork banhmi, and a braised beef bao. They put a large portion of meat inside, which I do appreciate, but I found them both to be extremely dry. My friend ordered a five spice pork belly bao, and she was obsessed with the flavor and was saying we should've gotten a five spice pork belly banh mi instead, but lesson learned for next time!"}
{"text":"So happy this place opened up close to work.    My hands down favourite is the FRIED CHICKEN BAO. Soooo unhealthy but soooooooooooooo freakin tasty. Easily in my top 5 favourite foods of all time...maybe even top 3. I could easily scarf down like 3-4 of them in a sitting. 5 stars for the fried chicken bao.  The pulled pork is my second favourite protein ... but dry, so make sure to ask for extra BBQ sauce on it.   Squid has been known to smell/taste too fishy some days and is a little rubbery as well.   Pork belly is supposedly their most popular but super fatty.   Kalbi beef and grilled chicken are okay but I hate all those pieces of grisle every other bite you have. Yucky.  French fries are good, jicama-papaya salad is meh.  Love that they offer cherry and vanilla coke too!   Oh, and lunch time can get really crazy. Just an FYI. Line-ups sometimes out the door. And you'll be hard pressed to find any seating during the lunch rush, so plan to take yours to-go."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular lunch stops when I am in Toronto. I LOVE their Bhan Mi's!!!   I always go for the grilled pork and it is so so so so GOOD. The steamed Bao's are also awesome especially the 5 spice pork belly. I also love the duck confit salad. Oh my... I am getting so hungry writing this review.   The only downside is the wait during lunch. To that I say, suck it up buttercup it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Grabbed some take out at BMB after the raptors game and some shopping on queen. Ordered a pork belly bahn mi and a Kalbi taco. Great value for money but service was a little slow as the place was packed as it ws near closing time (7pm). They should extend their hours on Sunday"}
{"text":"A few years ago, I came here for the first time and I was in utter awe. Like, how did I not think to put my favorite Korean grilled meat, Kalbi, into a Vietnamese sandwich????? And kimchi fries?! Who are these culinary geniuses and why are we not friends? That day, I ordered like four sandwiches to smuggle across the border. No joke (unless you're border patrol then I'm definitely lying). Also, they may or may not package the veggies separately from the meat and bread so that it wouldn't get soggy during your smugg..Errr I mean walk to your table."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices. I only wish they had more seating to accommodate the line-ups of people awaiting the flavourful Vietnemese subs and tacos. Word of advice: one person wait in line while the other scouts seating."}
{"text":"Two words. Kimchi fries! They are absolutely amazing!! Pair that with a ban mi and youre good to go! Too bad i dont live in canada otherwise id come here all the time!"}
{"text":"Service: Although we went during lunch rush, our food came out within 10-15 minutes. The cashier was also polite and helpful.  Food: I believe I've found my favorite Banh Mi sandwich ever, and an amazing side of a Braised Beef Steamed Bao and Sweet Potato Fries on the side. We ordered two Grilled Chicken Banh Mi with medium spicy level and it was absolutely delicious. On top of all that, the pricing was fair and cheaper than a lot of other similar options out there.  Overall: The next time I visit Toronto, I'm coming back here for sure! It's a very casual, simple, and incredibly satisfying place to eat."}
{"text":"I was craving for some kimchi fries in the morning on my way to work (great way to start the day) and ended up going to Banh Mi Boys for lunch!  I think the fries tasted more delicious because I was thinking about it all morning.  FOOD Fries. Pulled Pork. Kimchi. Mayo (a bit too much). Green Onions. It is a simple yet mouth watering combination. The pork was well seasoned and the kimchi was not too spicy. I would not pay $2 for extra kimchi, but the dish did need more kimchi in my opinion. I also wish they lightened up on the mayo. The portion size was great for lunch, but I found it to be a lot of food! I paired the dish with some coconut water with pulp. It was a refreshing finish.  SERVICE Quick serving time and the place was kept clean!  Am I still craving the fries? - just a little."}
{"text":"Delicious and inexpensive. That's really all you need to know.   The duck confit banh mi was incredible and so were the pork belly steamed bao."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is a great spot to get fast and casual Banh Mi and Bao sandwiches. I especially liked the Kalbi beef Banh Mi and the fried chicken Bao. The chicken was fried nice and crispy. The pork belly Banh Mi was good but I wished they put more pork belly in my sandwich."}
{"text":"The line goes out the door. This can either be a sign of great things to come, or it can be a sign of incredible hype that will leave you disappointed. Thankfully, BMB fell into the former category.  Highlights: + There be some serious tasties up in hyah. Bánh mì is odd when you think about it. Usually, it's hard bread that cuts up the roof of my mouth, and then I pretend that it was delicious. However, BMB baguettes hit that perfect middle between crunchy and soft. It wasn't overly chewy, and at the same time, the crust wasn't so hard that it felt like I just left the dentist. The meat is delicious, and BMB isn't stingy with the meat either.  + On the subject of meat, there will be no doubt in your mind about what kind of meat you're consuming at BMB; unlike some other bánh mì places where you can't be sure if it is in fact the meat you ordered. Here, the Kalbi beef is beef, and the pulled pork is pulled pork. There's no odd colors, or mystery meatish slices of... stuff to be seen. Also, all meats are dee-lay-shus. Particularly the five spice pork belly. Holy deity of your choice, there's some kind of magic in that there pig. + Service is fast. Even if you have to wait a while, it's not because the employees aren't giving their all. They're machine-like in how quickly they take your orders, ask you how spicy you want it, present the food to you, etc. They're also pretty friendly considering how many Torontonians are all up in their grills at any given moment.  Lowlights:  - I don't care for bao. Mostly, it's the consistency that gets me; it reminds me too much of mochi, which in turn reminds me too much of mucus. Blech. However, even the bao was pretty good. This was mostly because of what was in said bao: some sacrilegiously amazing pork belly.  - The other patrons. I had a lady in line next to me notice that I was looking at an empty spot in the (very small) eating space that was already crammed full of people. She then proceeds to yell at her friend, \"Grab that empty seat, grab it! Don't waste time!\" Slow your roll, crazy lady. I wasn't going to take your precious seat. Good luck finding an empty spot in BMB. There are squatters all over the place, essentially ensuring that you will have to go eat somewhere else - It is slightly more expensive than other bánh mì places, but still less expensive than you would expect for a restaurant in Toronto. It is what it is.  In summary: Get the Five Spice Pork Belly Bánh mì. Or the Kalbi Beef. Or the Pulled Pork. Also get the Kimchi fries. Biggest regret of my BMB experience is not trying the fries, and then seeing everyone else rave about them on Yelp. Thanks for rubbing it in my face, jerks."}
{"text":"Worth to go. The pork filling is juicy and tender. Define will go back and try rest of them. The service is great, just wait timing is long"}
{"text":"The food here was great! We decided to go on a Friday afternoon (a little later than the typical lunch time) and surprisingly it wasn't crowded. The food there is reasonably priced. I say go around 2-5 to avoid the long lines after when everybody is done their lunch breaks.   Ironically though, it was not the sandwiches which were my favourite but it was the kim chi fries! This is a must get if you're ever here but it's probably best to share as one alone is very filling.   The sandwiches are great. They taste similar to the ones I've bought before at T&T which are apparently made by the parents. Reason because of the similarity.   I do wish they offered combo so we could just get the sandwich with a drink. However, if you do need a drink, they'll give you tap water if you ask for it. I just happened to have had a water bottle as suggested from a friend. Just don't leave your water bottle there!"}
{"text":"Love this banh mi place! Not a lot of place to sit and hate it when people chit chat when there's folks waiting to sit to eat their damn banh mi! The steamed buns is very similar to my favorite food truck in San Francisco called Chairman Bao. My favorite is definitely the tofu. Mmm mmm good. And their versions of tacos made with \"prata\", drool."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to the quality.  I went back over the summer ( a while back) and I wanted to comment on the lackluster quality. I still love the kimchi fries and banh mis, but the kimchi fries portion I got was so tiny, I could finish it myself.  That being said, I still love the place, it just seems the portion shrunk a lot. The fad has seemed to die down, but they still seem to be fairly busy."}
{"text":"My third time eating their food, and the five spice pork spice banh mi never seems to disappoints me.  I ordered my favourite Banh Mi, the Five Spice Pork Belly. The fat of the pork belly is so sweet and delicious, and the spices are a magical sensation inside of your mouth. The sandwich itself is a marvel as the mixture of flavours and textures work perfectly. You have a hard crunch from the toasted bun and pickled veggies, and then the soft and tender prok belly. The carrots and other veggies also add the extra flavour that just keeps the sandwich so flavourful.   The sandwiches are a bit expensive for a meal that technically could be constructed yourself after working on the recipe, but the Banh Mi Boys do it so well."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys came to the rescue recently on the super-packed evening of Nuit Blanche with their delightful late night sandwiches.    Their FOOD is generally all well-cooked.  The high turnover keeps things fresh and hot, and I feel like they use high-quality meats.  The food is well-seasoned and spicy doesn't just mean capsaicin, instead nice adjuvants of five-spice powder, lemongrass, etc are added.  On the topic of spice, well, I would rate all of their spice levels one lower, e.g. their very spicy is spicy, their spicy is medium, etc.    My favorite dish is the simple grilled lemongrass pork bahn mi.  The bao are also quite tasty.  The SERVICE is generally prompt and friendly.  I also think it's good VALUE as the prices are quite nice.    The actual SEATING is pretty poor.  it's busy, and they tolerate the squatting behavior where someone 15 minutes from getting served hoards a table of 4; meanwhile, those with food actually don't get to sit and eat.  Very frustrated.  I like the places that have the rule that you can't sit until you have food.  Plan to take it elsewhere to eat."}
{"text":"Great place. I really like the assortment provided by the creative menu. I have yet to try the banh mi but I like the combinations they have. Everything is made to order so you get your food piping hot which I like. Compared to the cheaper banh mi shops in Chinatown, they do a better job of seasoning and marinating the meat. So in the kimchi fries I ordered, there was fries (obviously!), spring onions, bbq pulled pork, mayo and kimchi (of course, it's called kimchi fries for a reason). Back to the meat...omg the meat just melts in your mouth when you bite into it. The whole thing is placed into this box that is about the average for a book and it is very filling.  Pros: Extremely friendly staff, affordable prices, quick service and good food  Cons: Very limited seating, EXTREMELY BUSY DURING LUNCH HOURS (please avoid if possible) and narrow space in the order/pickup area.  Overall a good place, it will be worth the fight during the lunch hours to get your order and savor the deliciousness that this place has to offer :)"}
{"text":"This is the second location for Banh Mi Boys and I'm happy they did since the main location can get very very busy during peak lunch hours. I'm happy to say that this location is a lot bigger which means more sitting space :) Menu's still the same along with the variety of drinks they provide.  I ordered 2 Tacos (Kalbi Beef and Pulled Pork) The Kalbi Beef was very,very juicy and falls apart in your mouth, believe me it can get really messy, eating it...so much beef juice dripping down your hand or into the container. The Pulled Pork was hit and miss for me, I hoped for it to be like the Kalbi, like the meat will be succulent and melt in your mouth but it came off as sort of dry with very little meat juice. Oh well, I have yet to try the banh mi since I find it a bit pricey ahaha but otherwise I'll be back for more BMB goodness :)"}
{"text":"It's a pretty small and narrow place, good for a few people. The place was pretty empty on a weekend afternoon. Kimchi fries are pretty good. The kimchi is not too overpowering. Fries are crispy. All the sandwiches are pretty solid. I got the grilled chicken, full of flavor and not dry at all."}
{"text":"Nice and cheap place, but maybe I didn't order the right thing...will be back to try it again if I am in the area.  I tried the duck confit sandwich, the first bite was good, and then it gets saltier and saltier...I did manage to finish the sandwich though. The sandwich is a good size, and they do give enough duck for the price. I am not a huge fan of it, so I will try something else next time."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first, but the pulled pork sandwich convinced me otherwise. The pickled veggies tasted like they came from my mama's kitchen and that's absolutely a good thing. The chef(s) here definitely know what they are doing. Will definitely come back and am going to bring friends."}
{"text":"The five spice pork belly bahn Mi gets all the acclaim and trust me, it's plenty good. But if I'm going with one thing off the menu it's the fried chicken bao. A soft and lovely bun that holds a deep fried, delectable piece of crispy fried chicken. That'll get you through the day."}
{"text":"Great spot to eat on Queen W. Love the Banh Mi and Kimchi Fries. I first tried this a couple of weeks after it opened, since then its developed a cult following and the place is constantly packed. Can't wait for the Yonge and Gerrard location to open too.  Space is a little cramped, and that seems to be my only complaint. The staff there are friendly and work efficiently. The food is fresh and well prepared. My only real gripe is the at times, the pork can be a little too chewy for my liking, but that hasn't been consistent during the times that I've been there.   I would recommend this place if you're looking for a fresh tasting sandwich and a little bit of kick. Mind you, the foods can get a little spicy if your pallet isn't used to kimchi or any sort of hot sauce."}
{"text":"If I had to condense my review to one word: LEGIT.  I was a bit worried this joint would be some trendy hipster doofus joint.  You know who I'm taking about - they will take a very simple food item -- i.e. pizza, burgers, hot dogs, ice cream, donuts, sandwiches, etc... and repackage it by adding a few premium ingredients.  Open shop in a trendy area and create a fake buzz in the social media world.  Have some tongue-in-cheek logo.  Maybe hang up a \"Keep Calm and [insert appropriate ender]\" poster.  Name something on the menu after 'Chuck Norris' and something after another overplayed meme that really isn't funny anymore.  Have some 'secret menu' so early adopters feel special for knowing about it.  Start a Twitter account and start retweeting 'smart' things.  Play some edgy music in store and hire some young hip employees -- probably covered in trendy sleeve tattoos.  Hopefully, they will be 'cool' enough to work slow - so line-ups form outside the doors -- adding to the ever-growing buzz.  Alright - I've given you the formula - now open a restaurant that'll be hot for a few months before people catch onto the fact you're just overcharging hipsters for pizza/burgers/hot dogs/ice cream/donuts/sandwiches/etc.  Make millions off the stupidity of the masses.  But - I was pretty surprised that Banh Mi Boys is legit.  Yes - they adding a new premium twist to the tried and true banh mi (which normally sells for $2 - $3 just up the street in Chinatown).  But I double dog dare you to have the duck confit banh mi and tell me it's not worth the $7.50.  Sure it's 2x - 4x the price of your standard banh mi, but it's a bargain compared to Subway or nearly every other premium sandwich joint I've been to.  And that duck confit is impossibly juicy, tender and sweet.  I'm seriously drooling and getting hard just thinking about it... too much information?  I've had their beef cheek and pork belly banh mi as well - while good, it didn't blow me away.  Get the duck confit banh mi - you will not regret it.  It's busy, but the service is dope.  The person making your sandwich will always check with you before spicing your order.  And they play good old school hip hop too.  So in short, BMB is the truth.  It's not a fly-by-night food shack built off hype rather than quality."}
{"text":"Amazing little place!!  I went on a Sunday afternoon, and wow was this placed ever packed! I decided to eat there and during that time it was constantly busy.   They take your order and you pay first.   (I ordered a chicken banh mi with a side of sweet potato fries).  Then you wait in another line until your name is called, so that they customize your order with your preferences in sauces.   The seating area is small, so if it's not packed you might be lucky enough to get a seat.   sweet potato fries are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. These were so very delicious!!!  The staff there is young and upbeat.  You can tell they enjoy working there, and they work well in this fast paced environment.    They were playing 90's hip hop which was nostalgic. Loved it!  I enjoyed everything about my experience here.  I will definitely be back for more sweet potato fries and to try out more of there menu options.  :) :) :)"}
{"text":"Small seating available but service was prompt and friendly.   The portion of the sweet potato fries was quite large but a bit over fried.  The sandwich was good but a bit to much mayo.    If you are looking for an alternative to Burger and regular fries this would be very similar but with an Asian flair.  I love the cilantro that they include in the banh mi.   Great for a quick bite on the go.  Street parking tricky to find as it is located on Yonge St.   Also, they always play 90's music which I love.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Popped in right before a line built up so was thankful for beating the dinner rush! It's a super small place so take out may be better.   I got the duck salad (shredded papaya I think) and tried their tofu kimchi fries (maybe I was starving but this was amazing!). Overall a nice treat and something that my hubs craves (well, the kimchi fries at least)!   It is downtown though so parking is pretty tough!"}
{"text":"A great advantage of this place is that you can come in for a full meal or just grab a snack. There is a great option for what you may be looking for at the moment. If you want something healthy and substantial, get the bahmi sandwich. If you are seeking out something more greasy, get the kimchi fries. Just feeling peckish? Get a bao for a pillowy bun stuffed with meat, veggies or a combination of both. For an additional level of customization, you can choose what level of spice you want to endure at the moment.    I recently felt like a greasy treat for lunch, so I got the kimchi fries and a braised beef bao. It was more than enough for lunch and had the leftover for a late-day snack. The fries are crispy, loaded with pork, kimchi and green onions. Not too spicy even though there is kimchi, it lent more of a vinegary tang than anything burning. The pork was well seasoned and flavorful. The bao's bun was marshmallow-soft and slightly sweet, making it the perfect balance against the savory meat stuffing."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches! My kalbi beef was delicious and spicy. The kimchi fries was great as well and so filling! Fries are enough for a meal with a good portion of pulled pork in it."}
{"text":"Been here many times and never fails to disappoint. I've tried almost everything on the menu, but my personal favourites are the five spicy pork belly banh mi, and the kimchi fries. Both are packed with flavour, probably super unhealthy, but there's nothing else like it in Toronto. Price is very affordable. Definitely a must visit if you are touring Toronto."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 4.5, if that option was available. Pretty much all the food here is awesome.   Notable favorites are the pulled pork taco, and the kimchi fries with pulled pork.   The banh mi is light and tasty, and the steamed bao is a pillowly doughy delight :D"}
{"text":"*4.75 stars*  It's back! It's back!  And it's delicious as ever still.  However, I found that it was better the first time.  Perhaps it's because you got to choose what you wanted in your taco prior to the renovations.  I came here last Friday with my friends.  I ordered myself the kalbi taco (since they ran out of pulled pork) and the kimchi fries.  The kimchi fries were DELICIOUS.  Very different -- if you're not into the \"sour spicy\" then don't try it.  They had pork in it as well, and it was delicious.  The kalbi taco was absolutely delicious, and had a good mixture of everything.  My plan is to try to have everything on the menu before the end of the year.  Gluttony at its best.  Why 4.75 and not 5?  The place is tiny.  Very very tiny.  Lack of seats, especially on a Friday evening.  My friends and I were crowded around the bar seats.    Otherwise, delicious.  Need to try duck confit banh mi."}
{"text":"This is not your Vietnamese Mother's Banh Mi. And I love myself an authetic Banh Mi, but this place gets its well deserved hype.   Get: Braisd Beef Cheeks Banh Mi Five Spice Pork Belly Bao (soo fluffy) Jicama/Papaya Salad (just needs some heat)  Everything is soo good, I think I would go for the duck Banh Mi next time!"}
{"text":"Kimchi Fries and 5 Spice Pork Belly Banh Mi were both awesome. (Fries is big enough to share for 2)."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys- I thank you.  I literally, cannot get enough.  I have now tried a few menu items and want to gush all about them!  - Pulled Pork Taco: This is my favorite, favorite, item. The porc is drenched in delicious sauce, delish kim chi, some daikon and carrot, some cilantro...oh and apparently the taco (including all breads) are made in house.. so you can only image.  - Pork Belly Bao: The meat is succulent, and the bao is refreshing! If you want something a litte more light.. go for this beautiful little package.  - Squid taco: This is so unique, and special. Fried squid in a taco? *drool*  - Kimchi fries: Holy moly. Home made fries, pulled pork, kimchi, mayo, green onions. This is a meal on its on- but so worth the calories!  ....I think i am going to go there right now!"}
{"text":"Good, reasonably priced banh mi sandwiches. I ordered a sandwich with pork and had it delivered through hurrier, which was convenient. The sandwich was so huge that I couldn't finish it. It tasted very fresh and was quite yummy. The fries were just okay."}
{"text":"5 stars plus for this place!!  Love at first bite of the pork belly steamed bao!  I was head over heals for that bao.  The bao was soft and warm.  The pork belly was tender, juicy and melted in my mouth.  Hmmmm...... it was so good!!  I tried the Kimchi fries after finished the bao, and I was falling head over heels again.  Couldn't imagine kimchi, pulled pork, green onion and fries can be this perfectly matched.  Ohhhh........ I couldn't get them out of my head now........ got to come again and again..............."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch spot. I especially love their panko tofu bao. Getting a table can sometimes be a challenge but the line moves quickly so you won't have any problems getting it to go."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, tasty sandwiches.  My friends and I got an assortment of banh mi (grilled pork, grilled chicken, calamari) and a few steamed bao. They were all very tasty, though I wish they could have included jalapenos for heat instead of just Sriracha. That detail aside, the grilled pork banh mi was surprisingly authentic! If only they offered pate...  Not much seating, and very crowded at lunchtime, but definitely a hit, even for those who'd never had banh mi before!"}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC. Honestly, I was sad to leave Toronto without trying the entire menu here.   While making your order, they ask what your spice tolerance is and customize to your preference. My friend got a tofu taco that literally brought him to tears (mostly the spice, but also because it was THAT delicious), while my grilled pork bahn mi had just a little kick to it.   The ingredients taste superfresh, the cooks are always on their game, and the PRICES! So fantastically cheap for the awesome blend of flavors that this place offers. It was definitely a highlight of my time in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love that they load up on the pickled veggies so that each bite is a great combo of the barbeque pork and sweet/sour flavor. Also loved the baos, especially the braised beef. Bread toasted, baos soft and pillowy, which are musts. Nguyen Hong in the Chinatown area is much cheaper and much, much faster (the wait at BMB can be tortuous), but the meat and veggie at BMB are so good! Yep, definitely a fan."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place, and tasted the pork belly bao, fried chicken bao, kalbi beef taco and pulled pork taco. Loved everything except the chicken. It was really crispy and tasty, but the texture of the meat really reminded me of frozen chicken fingers, like you'd get in a box at the grocery store. If you're like me and really put off by that texture, I'd pass on this one. Everything else was amazing. Will definitely go back to try the kimchi fries."}
{"text":"I love Banh Mi Boys! (Unless you hate kimchi) TRY their kimchi fries, it's very good!  Their baos, their subs, and tacos are all awesome and you cannot go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Always gotta' stop at Banh Mi Boys when we're in Toronto! The staff is super friendly and they get their shiz done fast considering how many customers they have coming in.   Love the 5 spice pork belly steamed baos! You got everything you need there flavor wise. The sweetness from the bun, the savory (and yet also sweet deliciousness O___o) from the pork and the crunchy acidity from the pickle, cucumber and carrots- perfection all in one bite!  Always end up eating in the car, not even mad about it- love me some pork belly baos!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that needs to be on \"gotta eat here\". Because you really do. The Grilled Chicken Bahn Mi is the perfect fix!   Kimchi fries can be greasy and a bit soggy, but I can see them as being a serious hangover-day hit."}
{"text":"Fantastic vietnamese sub. Had the duck confit-did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Honestly, the only thing wrong with Banh Mi Boys is that they're not in my neighborhood.  The last time I was in Toronto, I literally dropped my bags at the hotel and trucked it over to get a sandwich -- it did not disappoint.  My mother wouldn't turn her nose up at your kimchi -- it's really good (and maybe not traditional on a Vietnamese sandwich, but throw caution to the wind and just go for it)!  I'm already looking forward to my next day off in Toronto..."}
{"text":"Whenever I can't make up my mind as to where to eat, I default to Banh mi boys if it's within the area.  Great food, awesome service, and it's affordable."}
{"text":"Good value for great food. I've only had the kalbi beef taco, grilled chicken taco, and kimchi fries. Everything is flavorful. I love that there's a lot of veggies in the tacos. The sauce is a bit sweet so i like to ask for my tacos on the spicy side.   Kimchi fries is a big portion, better be sharing them! Have to have them while it's hot. I really think the pulled pork and the cheese are the best part. The kimchi could have been cut into smaller pieces, it's decent kimchi.  I shall return!"}
{"text":"Kimchi fries were to die for, and the SQUID, OH THE SQUID. The squid reminds me of the old chinese buffet's I would go to as a child on a special occasion and load up a whole plate of fried tentacles (I kid you not, I've been loving fried tentacles since I was old enough to eat solids). Everything was made to perfection, the meats were not drained in sauce but given the right amount and the combinations were unique and flavourful. Yes Yes and Yes I will visit again. I am taking off one star because even though what was on my fries was amazing they were undercooked and you can't have undercooked fries. But I'm sure that's a once in a lifetime thing."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for a quick meal. Their banh mis are consistently amazing and I can't get enough of their squid tacos  Having been to this and the Queen W locations, I have to say this location is much better in terms of service."}
{"text":"Back when Banh Mi Boys first opened, I happened to be working in the area so I managed to essentially try (and love) everything on the menu. It's now become a bit more rare for me to head to either of the two locations and even when I do, I am inevitably disappointed.  My most recent trip was a few days ago and I ordered what used to be my favorite item on the menu: the Pulled Pork Banh Mi. One thing I definitely miss from the days of yore is how spicy the sandwiches used to be. I would ask for my sandwich extra spicy and it would give me a run for my money. Now I ask for it extra spicy and it would barely faze a small child.  Anyway, as for the sandwich itself, the bread was as delicious as ever but the pulled pork was a dry clump of meat, essentially. There was no juiciness there. Exacerbating the meat's dryness was an almost total absence of sauce. The delicious sauce that used to be abundantly added to ever sandwich is now applied sparingly and localized in one area of the sandwich (ie I took entire bites without any sauce).  For the price, it's still a decent sandwich. But given how epically amazing Banh Mi Boys' fare used to be, I can't help but feel incredibly disappointed. It's no longer a must-visit when I'm in the area, and that depresses the hell out of me."}
{"text":"Delicious steamed Bao- I've tried the pulled pork and the braised beef, both were fresh and tasty !! Note: they put lots of Cilantro on the Baos, so if you're one of those people that have a visceral negative reaction- asked for it without!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that these guys modernized Vietnamese sandwiches (Banh Mi) and made it cooler than it initially was. Please add on kimchi fries with whatever it is you're getting here. While you're at it, get the Club Bao (Secret menu item), it's a piece of fried chicken in between the buns."}
{"text":"Just SO good. I get the fried chicken in bao buns. It's just SO good, the fresh veg makes it. A must try if you have not been here before."}
{"text":"As somebody not well-versed in Vietnamese food, Banh Mi Boys has given me incredible expectations. I'm writing this having gone 5-6 times in the past month. My favorite thus far has been the 5-spice pork belly banh (seriously, try it!) but you really can't go wrong with the pulled pro (super cheap too)! Living nearby it's become my go-to place to grab a sandwich/small meal at any point during the day"}
{"text":"Love Banh Mi Boys! A nice medium sized menu - from baguette sandwiches, their sweet baos, and their flakey tacos - filled with your choice of delicious fillings like pork belly, squid, duck confit, beef cheeks and more... and topped with crunchy pickled radishes and slaw topped with spicy sauce, and sweet mayo....how can you go wrong?   My personal favourite is the squid taco - not your typical taco shell - it resembles an indian paratha shell, or chinese pancake. It's a flakey, cripsy shell that has a wee bit of chew that helps retain the insides of your taco. The squid is fried in a light batter, and is seasoned well. The squid is tender, and not over cooked at all. Slaw, some type of spicy mayo brings the whole thing together.   The pork belly bao is also really tasty, however, I do find the combination of the pork belly and the bao and the pickled radish to tip on the sweeter side. But you get a decent sized piece of pork belly, and it's a complex tasting sandwich. The bao is the perfect vehicle for the rich fatty belly and then you have the crunch of the radish. Just delicious!      Kimchi fries are delicious as well! If you like kimchi, and you like mayo on fries...this is your jam. spicy, sweet, salty, hot / cold...SO GOOD!   The baugettes are good - but in all honesty, I wouldn't go here for a baguette sandwich -the bread is not as cripsy on the exterior as other banh mi places. The traditional banh mi places don't offer the same tasty fillings as BMB though. And I would rather get a nice sweet bao or flakey taco when I am here.   The staff is friendly - quick and efficient. This is fast, good food at a VERY reasonable price. And the variety on the menu is an invitation for repeat visits just to try all their items!     Finding a seat can be difficult at times since it's a small area- but it's fast food - so you don't have to wait long for a table to free up."}
{"text":"Not authentic style but still delicious. This is more of a modern twist to traditional Vietnamese Banh Mi subs. Got the Pork Belly sandwich with everything on it. Wish it had the pate', Vietnamese Sausage, and pork tendons like traditional ones had. I still enjoyed it though. Sweet Potato fries are a must on the side for a greasy sweet bite apart from the fresh crunchy sandwich.   Place is really small and seats get filled quick with tables not cleaned up when it's busy. So get your food, eat quick, and get out so the next customers can sit."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from this restaurant, was not able to give it another chance as I can no longer bring myself to eat here."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch this week after reading Yelp reviews and I was not disappointed. I had the pork belly bahn mi and it was fantastic. I can't wait to come back to try the rest of the delicious sounding food!"}
{"text":"- What I have tried    + Grilled pork banh mi (5/5): very different from Nguyen Huong banh mi, I think mainly because of their amazing bbq sauce. This is alway my go-to banh mi every time I visit here.    + Pulled pork taco (4/5): It was good but not surprisingly good. I still prefer the Mexican taco version    + Five spice pork belly steam bao (5/5): It was delicious, meat was soo tender and well marinated. Everything just blended so well together.    + Pulled Pork steam bao (5/5): Tastes just like pulled pork taco but in a steam bao version, which I like more because the softness of the bao went so well with meat and everything.     + Kimchi fries (4/5): It's something that you thought it's good when you first ate it, but you don't want more after finish it. It was like fries and kimchi with mayo sauce, delicious but nothing too special about it.  - Portion: small, I wouldn't be full with only one banh mi - Price: Pricey compared to Nguyen Huong, but the food is better, so I would say that the price is fair  - Place is small, if you do during lunch or dinner hours, there will be no seat at all."}
{"text":"I called at 11:55 am to order some food on a Sunday not realizing they open an hour later than they do during the rest of the week, the girl who answered the phone put down the phone and started ranting about customers calling too early.  If she wasn't ready to take orders she didn't have to answer the phone.  As a regular customer this experience has really soured my opinion of the place and I will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Is banh mi the next TO food fad? If it can all be as good as BMB I hope so. The Kalbi beef banh mi is incredible, as are the kimchi fries and the previously reviewed squid taco. This place has been open for less than a year and seems to have quite the following, despite the construction outside its front door."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I've hesitated going to for the longest time. I'm not too big of a fan for fusion food normally but after much persuasion from many people raving about it, I had to check it out for myself. Good thing because I wasn't disappointed.  Banh Mi Boys puts a nice spin on the traditional banh mi. I ordered the pork banh mi and the meat was marinated very well accompanied by plenty of pickled vegetables and sauces. The sandwich overall was really good. I also tried their kimchi fries and was not disappointed. I normally don't prefer eating kimchi but for some reason, the kimchi in the fries are really good. It's not as sour or spicy as you'd expect.  It can get really packed during lunch hours and definitely difficult to find seating at lunch. Go for take out even though you'll still be standing in a long line. The best way to get food quickly is use the Ritual food app and preorder your food to pick up right away. You bypass the line completely that way!"}
{"text":"First, I'll explain why I'm giving two stars... The food is actually quite good, but the service and atmosphere make me cringe.   So if you come here during any normal meal time, you will certainly be met with a large lineup and full tables. That really isn't their fault, except they could theoretically move to another larger location. Perhaps that's an unreasonable request...?   The armpit of humanity really comes out, though, when it's -10* outside and everyone is huddled in their tiny restaurant, people farther back in line \"reserve\" tables by putting their crap on it or have someone from their group just sit down. That's just not cool, but the place doesn't try and do anything about it. It's another thing that's really not their fault, but it makes for a really irritating experience.   Another annoying thing is that the last time I went I asked for a can of pop to be added to my bill as I couldn't get to the pop fridge without climbing the Mt. Everest of people between me and the pop. I paid and got my sandwich and grabbed a cherry coke and luckily found a table. The cashier came up to me, after I had sat down and opened my pop and told me that cherry coke was 25 cents more. Okay, fine, there were no signs and she didn't ask what kind of pop I wanted, but whatever, it's a quarter. I only had a toonie which I gave to her. She didn't return with my change ($1.75) so after my meal I went up and asked for it. She just looked at me and said she didn't know what I was talking about. I re-explained the situation, with some guy next to her and they started entering something into their register and just said \"sorry, we can't open the till\". At that point I just said forget it. It's seriously not worth my aggravation.   So they fully alienated a customer because they wanted their stupid quarter for an un-priced pop. I'm sorry, it's that's just bad. You have lineups out the door all day long and you think stealing $1.75 will go unnoticed?   I won't be going back. The whole experience there is just so awful. The food is tasty but not at all worth the terrible terrible god awful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Banh Mi is something my fiance and I love! We were very excited to hear about the various Banh Mi Boys locations throughout Toronto. After shopping through the Kensington Market we decided to pop in for a bite.   We ordered the braised beef cheek boa steam bun, the five spice pork belly banh mi, and the pulled pork boa steam bun, all with sriracha. We were very happy with the consistency of the steam bun with the exception of it being on the cold side; infact, the beef cheek boa was agreeably our favorite thing we ordered here. While the banh mi buns were perfect with a nice crusty crunchy exterior and light fluffy interior the filling left us wanting more. The pickled veg was fine, the meat was fine, we were just looking for more than fine.   Staff was young and uninviting, uninterested. We wouldn't recommend against this establishment, we just wont be going back."}
{"text":"Tasty tasty fusion food at great value! Banh Mi Boys is reasonable fare because it's right beside Chinatown, where you can get legit banh mi's for a tooney, so they really can't overcharge. Their flavouring is so good, even as I write this I am salivating!   To share, definitely get the highly recommended kimchi fries. Attempt this alone if you're starving. The jicama papaya salad is nice if you need a crunchy cleanser. I recommend all the BMs except for the squid  (strange taste) and pulled pork (meh average). For those with little bellies already half filled with kimchi fries, I recommend a braised beef cheek bao.   I've never been here in the winter, but it gets hot diggity in the shop while you're waiting for your order along the kitchen. My heart goes out to the line cooks who have to brave every noon hour with fashion/design clientele all lined up staring at you with their sweaty hungry cut-eyes.   Come for an off hour treat and skip lunch/dinner/midnight snack. The flavours will have you itching for more!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is, but decided to give this a try based on all the reviews.  Maybe it was too hyped up, but it wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be. Maybe it was what we had ordered, but it was just ok. We had ordered the kimchi fries, which was kind of like a NY Fries \"the works\". The grilled pork banh mi was ok.   Will be back to try other stuff, like the bao version and the pork belly."}
{"text":"Petit resto, sympa sur la rue Yonge. De très bons sandwichs vietnamiens qui ont d'ailleurs eus la chance d'être présentés à l'émission \"you gotta eat here\". La viande est gouteuse, les légumes marinés et la coriandre ajoutent de la fraicheur et le pain super frais. Le service est courtois."}
{"text":"The portions are large and filling and the food was great. I prefered the beef cheek over the pork belly which were the two banh mis we had ordered.   Service was good and I liked the order system they had set up, it kept the cash area from getting cramped. Slightly more than I would normally like to pay for a sandwich, but with good quality ingredients I would say it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent banh-mi! Even when I had it a couple hours later cold, on the train. It was crowded when I got there, around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon, but the line kept moving and I got mine within 5-10 min."}
{"text":"Tried the 5 spice pork belly Banh Mi and it was fantastic! Good as any Banh Mi I have ever had. The only complaint, is the meat was a little on the fatty side for me. But the bread and ingredients were extra fresh. They were quite busy around lunch time but was very quick delivering the orders. I would definetly patron this spot again and so should you if your in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came back today for the kim chi fries since I didn't get to try it last time.  It was declicious! (4/5 stars)  Overall is still a 3-star though, nothing to fancy or special about this.  But a great sandwich shop nonetheless."}
{"text":"We ordered the 5 spice pork belly banh mi, pulled pork steam bao and kimchi fries!    The 5 spice pork belly banh mi was very delicious! The bread tasted fresh and it had a perfect crunch while contrasting with all the sauce, fresh veggies and meat!  The steam bao was meh~ I wished there was some kind of sauce that comes with it. At one point, it was hard to swallow because it was way too dry.   The kimchi fries were really scrumptious! The flavours really complement each other. The fries were piping hot when it was served to us. The kimchi on top of the fries wasn't too spicy. I enjoyed the hint of spice which gave this dish a depth of flavour! The truth is I don't even like fries and I really LOVE this dish! This mean a lot for somebody who doesn't even like fries!   The place was tiny! We were lucky to find a spot to sit and the tables were really close to each other. I felt squished in this compacted space. At one point, I had to move our table a few times so other customers can go through. We barely talked during our meal because all I can hear were other people's conversation beside us. We left right after we finished our meal. We end up going somewhere else with more comfortable seating to enjoy the rest of the night. There's no way a large group of people can fit in this dining area. You will have better luck ordering takeout and go somewhere else to sit and enjoy your food.  Also, the price for the food was pretty reasonable. For all that food it only cost us around $20!  I would totally recommend their kimchi fries! It is a MUST try item!"}
{"text":"Freaking delicious bahn mi. I had the five spice pork belly bahn mi and I've been craving it ever since. It is really good, nice hot sandwich with really everything, they have pickled radish, coriander, carrots cucumber, and the delicious five spice pork belly is nice and soft and they're very generous with how much they pack into one sandwich. The environment is actually pretty nice though I didn't dine in.   the bahn mi is amazing, will try the steamed bao's next time and update!"}
{"text":"God I love this place! I always get the spiced pork bahnmi and it never disappoints. I also always let my bahnmi sit so it gets cold but that doesn't stop it from being mind numbingly delicious! The copious amount of vegetables in there and the large, thick and soft pieces of pork belly satisfy my every craving not to mention it's also rather large!  I have yet to try the baos but I will almost definitely update my review to include them and the kimchi fries!"}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese sandwich that money can buy. The pork belly was soft and tender and had great flavours. The veggies inside the bun were fresh and the bread had a nice toasty crunch to it. Price is good and service was excellent."}
{"text":"These guys took taste to a whole new level.  If you're in downtown after a night out, this is where you should go. Also works great if you're showing around parts of town, coz Kensington market is right around the corner.  Pulled pork in a bun, fries with pulled pork,.. tops the list."}
{"text":"I just want to keep coming back! The kimchi sweet potato fries are just amazing! amazing! Just take a bite with fries, pulled pork, kimchi and mayo, the combination explodes in your mouth!  The steamed bao is also brilliant! Make me feel more satisfied with the soft bao than any other kind of sandwich bread. Just love the place"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my go-to places for a quick bite downtown. Although I used to frequent the original location on Queen and Spadina quite a bit, I've found myself in this area more recently.   They have a great selection of banh mi sandwiches, particularly the kalbi beef which is one of my favourites. But perhaps the best item they have is not even advertised, the club bao. A part of their \"secret menu\", the club bao is a steamed bao stuffed with pork belly and a large piece of fried chicken, topped with pickled carrots, radish and cilantro. The perfect accompaniment to any of their sandwiches is their famous kimchi fries. Crispy fries topped with kimchi and pulled pork, I don't think I've ever had a meal here without it.   As an added bonus, their pop selection has somewhat hard to find varieties such as Tahitian Treat, Cherry and Vanilla Coke."}
{"text":"The baos and bahn mis are sooo good  But the lines are quite long during weekday lunch rush.   Really, that's all there is today.   Highly recommend their pulled pork bao and chicken bahn mi"}
{"text":"This city needs more Banh Mi and this place delivers! The spices are plentyful, the food is cheap and the flavour is amazing.  The bao was very fresh and hit the spot. If you're going the bao or Taco route, get 2 as they're not enough on their own. The five Spice Pork belly was good, but the Beef Bao stole the show!  Wait times are reasonable for lunch time takeout considering this is day 2 of them being open and the line goes out the door!  Definitely stop by for a quick bite of happiness!"}
{"text":"Had the Pork Belly and Beef Cheek Steamed Baos  Pork belly is one of their most popular, and rightly so. The salty pork + the sauce works perfectly with the sweet bao and the acidic pickled vegetables. The beef cheek was super tender but not as good of a combination. Glad they opened another one so close to me!"}
{"text":"Used Ritual app for quick pick up.   Easy, quick and tasty. Banh mi boys is one of my go-to restaurants for good cheap and delicious.   I usually get braised beef cheek and Kalbi beef Banh mi. The bun is pretty big, but the portion of meat inside is not as filling compared to the veggies they stuff inside. But you seriously can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They do Banh mi fancy fusion with Korean flare.  This location is ALWAYS busy, so I'd suggest using the RITUAL app to get it in and out. And if you want, here's a promo code for first time users.   Promo code:  CHRISTEN7181 for $10   $5 when you sign up and then another $5 after your first purchase (made within of 5 days of d/l)"}
{"text":"Well priced and fast food in Toronto. Chicken was not as great as reviews suggested but overall pork dishes were on point."}
{"text":"I used to work in the neighbourhood and would frequent BMB. Located in an area where there is an abundant amount of delicious food to choose from (Burger's Priest, Rose City, etc), BMB makes a tasty meal that is inexpensive and fairly quick (depending on what time you're there at).  Service is always efficient and friendly and staff are knowledgable about their menu.  Standout items include: squid tacos (be careful of the sauce it contains, the cabbage the taco has turns it purple and you *will* be covered in it by the end of your meal), grilled pork banh mi, and the kimchi poutine (which is fairly heavy and best split between two people - your body will thank you).  I feel like the layout is a bit awkward; it can be a tight squeeze while waiting for food. But it's not the hugest space, so I can understand why they have the layout they do.  Great music playing as well."}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot about this place, but have been hesitant about going because a lot of people have said it isn't worth the extra money compared to the regular $2 Banh Mis on Spadina. They are wrong. Although the $2 Banh Mis are a steal, and make for a quick lunch, you are certainly getting what you pay for when you go to Banh Mi Boys. My sandwich came up to $6.77, which was very reasonable for what I got. This place must have an immense amount of pressure to keep their prices down given   a) the competition in the area b) the fact that most people who know what a Banh Mi is are used to paying $2 on Spadina  Therefore, the fact that they can offer what they do at this price point is impressive.  The Food (Pork Belly Sandwich):  - The bread was very fresh, tasty, and was toasted perfectly (not too hard, not too soft) - There was a decent amount of tasty, tender meat. It was a little fatty, but this is to be expected from pork belly - The meat was of good quality; leaps and bounds better than the \"mystery meat\" of the classic $2 Banh Mi.  - The vegetables were also very fresh, and I enjoyed how there was a pickle in the sandwich which I have never had before - The hot sauce was great as always (I'm a big fan of this sweet hot sauce in Banh Mi sandwiches) - I asked for spicy, and the hot sauce was unevenly distributed with one half being \"medium\" and the other half being \"very hot\". This isn't a deal breaker, but just an observation.  The atmosphere:  - Loved the music they were playing in here. Great old school hip hop playing at good volume - The decor was decent. I liked the lamp shades on the lights - The staff was friendly and helpful. - The cleanliness of the place was pretty poor, and this is why the place gets a 3, instead of the 4 it would have received if it was cleaner. There were discarded napkins and food under every single table, with as many as 10 or more discarded napkins under some tables. The 2 tables that were free had varying degrees of mess on the tables from previous customers. There were no tables whose tops were completely clean. I can understand that some customers are quite messy and that the employees may not have had time to clean up after these people, but given that there was a mess under and on every table indicates to me that staff had not cleaned in while, and did not care about the establishment's general cleanliness. One of my biggest pet peeves at a fast food joint is when the place is this messy, because it makes me feel like I'm eating in a barn.  That being said, the food here was great, and I will go back to this place, and change my review if the place cleans itself up.   This restaurant is a welcome and significant improvement to the other fast food options on this corner, being McDonalds, A&W and Hero Burger."}
{"text":"If I was living in Toronto, this will be my favorite spot because of the kimchi fries. A local guided me to this place. I enjoyed it so much that I came back the next day. For $7.35 (after taxes), definitely worth it. For any tourist staying at the Clarence hostel, this place is only a short walk towards Chinatown."}
{"text":"You already know that the food at this place is Ah-Maze-ZING.  I find that this place is less busy during the dinner/late night hours.  The duck confit was ok, but not really my favourite compared to some of their other offerings. The BF gives more love to the fried chicken bao and I find that it does offer something salty and cooling at the same time. The kim chi fries are enough to feed at least two people as a side order.   Normally our order is like this - 1 fried chicken bao, 1 kalbi taco, and 1 pork belly banh mi with a kim chi fries and the splitting of the meal goes like this - BF, the bao, 1/2 the taco and the bahn mi and 75% of the kim chi fries - ,and me the remainder because while this stuff is amazing - I really don't want to think about how high the sodium levels and grease, etc.    Dining in is ok, but the last few times we hit up the Boys - we noticed that there was a flock of flies buzzing around - which doesn't really do much for our appetites - although that is what To-Go is all about."}
{"text":"Came here to grab some food to eat for my bus trip to Montreal. We got here 10-15 minutes before they opened on a Wednesday morning and got to watch a girl work here magic, squeeging the windows and making the front door squeaky clean.   Anyways, we ordered a couple things but for myself, I bought: - Kimchi fries ($5 I think) - good but heavy on the stomach especially if you eat this all to yourself. Definitely share with a few friends.  - Five spice pork banh mi ($6) - so good! The five spice definitely gives this banh mi it's unique taste. A nice fusion spin/take to banh mi's.   Cheap place to get your banh mi fix. Wish I had room to try one of their steamed bao's. Next time!"}
{"text":"Don't be disparaged if there is a line when you arrive. This place does fast service with quick turn over in their seating area, too.  Bring a friend to split an order of kimchi fries with. The sandwiches are perfect -- buns with the right texture of soft and chewy and high quality fillings that are perfectly spiced to your palette."}
{"text":"Normally I'm picky when I walk in, to see if it's authentic and while hearing no Vietnamese voices, all young hard working with perfect English accents, these high ratings was hard to ignore.  Especially the kimchi fries, easily the best dish hands down.  The rest of the crew ordered some form of banh mi, but I can get that at home, at a real, hole in the walls type lol.  But their signature pork belly is worth ordering again.  Back to the fries; the combination of  mayo, green onions and pulled pork, this is a real winner, and somewhat unique.  Fast, considering how big the lineups are.  Tough to get a seat so be prepared for takeout, even late in the night."}
{"text":"Awesome food here. Especially love the kimchi fries, pork banhi mi and the sweet potatoe fries. The service is not bad. I come here pretty often and my friends also love their food!"}
{"text":"Happened upon this place when DH & I were heading to the burger's priest across the street but found it had moved....since we paid for parking in the lot nearby we decided to walk around & eat somewhere else in the area. BMB was a little down & across the street. DH wanted to just grab McDonald's (next door) but I convinced him to check out BMB instead.  I'm  Glad we did!!!     The place was packed & the lineup kept growing (happy we got there when we did!!)....kind of an awkward setup with not much room for all the customers to stand tho. Staff moved quickly to serve us so didn't have to wait around long.   Pulled pork bahn mi was a good taste of sweet & smokey...veggies were fresh, crunchy. Not a big fan of baguettes but didn't want a steamed bun or taco & was happy it wasnt too hard to eat:-)  (still messy tho). Enjoyed it!  DH had the short ribs bahn mi. He wasn't too impressed but said it was ok.   pay parking lot right behind their building ($5 Saturday)  Did I see them on Dragon's Den???? Seem oddly familiar. ..lol"}
{"text":"I had a pork belly steamed bao, a pork bahn mi, and the kimchi fries.  There's evidently 10 of these in Toronto.  When food comes from a chain, I begin to fear and want to run away, but everything I had here was amazing.  Everything had so much flavor yet it was well balanced, nothing was too spicy but it still had heat, the texture of the bread, the balance between filling and bread of both the bao and the bahn mi, the kim chee fries were just such a beautiful gluttonous food such that I'm gonna try to make them at home, and just... yum.  It's really cheap too.  Probably the best fast-casual place I've ever been to anywhere, especially considering that there's so many locations to choose from."}
{"text":"Kimchi fries are the best! The portion is massive, I didn't even get to eat my taco because they were so big!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, super cheap! Get the kimchi fries for sure. The braised beef bao and the kimchi fry bao (off the secret menu) are delicious! I like these better than the squid or pork belly. The tacos are also pretty good but I prefer the baos."}
{"text":"This place feels like a Toronto classic with a fusion twist on Asian classics! My go to here is usually kimchi poutine, or one of the sandwiches. All the food is always hot and fresh (probably because of how busy they are), and the ingredients taste authentic, even though the dishes are fusions.   The spaces are usually small, and definitely not intended for long stays. I usually take my food to go and find a nicer area nearby (parks and public spaces abound).   Definitely good for quick eats!"}
{"text":"I am addicted to this place. Luckily I don't live too close to this restaurant otherwise I'd start looking like a Bao :D I recommend the five spice pork belly bao. Get two because you'll be sorry you didn't when you are down to your last bite. They're smallish. I also recommend any of their banh mi sandwiches. Everything tastes fresh and has great flavour combinations. I tend to pre order on Ritual because sometimes I can't find parking nearby and need to do a quick hop off hop on kinda deal. I can't think of anything negative or suggestions for improvement either. This restaurant is a keeper!"}
{"text":"It's good. It's fresh. It's different. I like their take on the Vietnamese sub. It tastes \"gourmet\" with a solid crusty bun and good meat fillings (I tried the braised beef). I do think they are a tad bit pricey though and are a little over rated."}
{"text":"My first time at this place was on a friday night around 9pm. My friends had all raved about the Kimchee fries and I was very excited to try this place with my boyfriend after a movie at dundas square.   First off, the cashier seemed a bit rude. When we were paying, we handed over a 20, but then offered exact change so we didnt have to carry a bunch of coins around. But no. She just stood there with the 20 and said sorry too late, already pushed in 20. what?! Just do the math... I work in retail and I know its annoying, but that's pretty rude.   We got the kimchee fries and the kalbi beef taco.   First off, yum! i loved the taco! It had a great mixture of flavours. Will definitely be getting that again.   But the kimchee fries kinda let me down... it kinda felt like i was just eating mayo and fries, and the kimchee and meat was sorta separate from the whole thing. Anywho, I just thought the flavours didn't mesh well.   basically, would come back for the tacos. Also heard great things about their sandwiches, so ill probably be back for those :)   Taste: 3/5 Service: 2/5"}
{"text":"Has the best sub and papaya salad I have ever had (in North America).  Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today - actually ordered via Ritual and ran over to pick up my lunch (highly recommend using Ritual).   Ordered: Grilled pork banh mi  Service: Service is why we lost a point mainly.  When I got in there, it was quite busy and the most miserable girl was working there.  I asked her where the pick up was and she begrudgingly answered.  Her attitude really sucked but if I were working at a banh mi stand, I'd be miserable too.    Taste: Taste was quite delicious - banh mi's are so delicious and they're quite hard to screw up.  The grilled pork was nice and juicy and the veggies were perfectly pickled.  The bun was quite soft too.    Overall: I'd totally go again, and now that I know where the Ritual pick up is, I won't have to deal with that sad banh mi girl!"}
{"text":"Always delicious.  Always friendly.  Keeps me coming back for the duck confit any time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I love the delicious kimchi fries and tofu tacos, served with slaw and pickles. Great service. Fast. Thanks, Banh Mi Boys!"}
{"text":"I had an empty stomach and time to kill before an appointment when I stumbled upon this place. Recognizable name yet I had never been.  I ordered the steamed bao in pork belly and fried chicken and waited for them to cook it. Grabbed a table in a fairly empty place. Wish the heavily cologned couple had not chosen the table right beside me. My head can feel that cologne.  Screw the cologne, there is a flavour explosion in my mouth. I started with the fried chicken bao and mmm the sweetvinegar carrots with cilantro and crunchy chicken is perfect. If I get this again would probably go without the mayo.  On to the five spice pork belly. Unplanned I had saved the best for last. I love five spice and with cilantro there are no words.  The place was clean and employees friendly. Nice and bright at the front, cozier towards the back."}
{"text":"As usual a stellar quick meal. We were on the way to the Jays game and this is way better than a crappy hot dog. :) pork belly and fried chicken naps hit the spot. Whitelines blaring - still as cool 30 years later."}
{"text":"Another one of those 3.5/5 establishments in terms of food, however due to quick and efficient service for a place like this I upped it to a four star.  We were initially hesitant due to the long lineup, and we only had 30 minutes for lunch. However, seeing how fast the line was moving we decided to go for it, and sure enough I was right at the front in about 3 minutes.  I ordered a braised beef cheek banh mi. They took down my name, and my order was prepared in about 7-8 minutes. Due to lack of seating we had to eat somewhere else, which somewhat inconvenienced us as we were in a rush. The food itself was okay, it didn't have the Vietnamese feel to it though...felt like I was eating a normal piece of bread with ingredients inside. I also noticed some of the employees inside were not Asian. Maybe I'm being picky or something, but it also questioned the authenticity of this place.  My friend ordered kimchi fries and she allowed me to try some. Not bad! Too bad I have low spice tolerance, otherwise I would consider ordering that next time.  I'll come back if I'm in the area, but perhaps I'll try the bao. It definitely looked better when I saw other people ordering them. I was overall satisfied though due to the cheap price and the fact it filled my stomach."}
{"text":"They do an amazing job of keeping the traditional taste and elevating it by playing with different proteins other than pate and cold cuts. Had the five spice pork belly, melts in your mouth. Also got the papaya salad, super refreshing for the summer and complements well.  Really efficient service for the lunchtime rush."}
{"text":"Stopped by for one last snack before we left Toronto. Sooo worth it!  I'd just had lunch so I was just going to have a single bite. Ended up scarfing down the whole thing.  Got the veggie bao. I thought it would be an enclosed bun and was wondering how the panko crust would stay crispy. Turns out it's more like a mini sandwich with the bun part being a folded piece of bao material. Um, YUM. It was the perfect combination of vinegary, sweet, spicy, and savory. The pickles were so refreshing and very nicely complemented the crispy tofu. The bun contributed the perfect amount of sweetness. How I wish I could try the veggie bahn mi too. Would stop by here all the time if I lived here!"}
{"text":"The options on the menu aren't very many, but the taste of each ones are something to come back for to bite into! Very convenient spot in downtown. Some tables and chairs, but it always gets packed each time I go in.  I recommend a definite try if you're ever nearby."}
{"text":"I've come here a handful of times and there is ALWAYS a lineup- a good sign no matter what restaurant you visit! Banh Mi Boys has fun and delicious items on the menu, so you can't really go wrong with any of their selections. The wait time depends on what time you go; I once went to BMB at around 4 pm and I only had to wait for a few minutes for my order.  The prices are a biiiiit expensive for me for the subs, but it's pretty decent if you get bao, tacos, or fries. The store layout is casual and reminiscent of fast-food chains, so I prefer to order takeout when possible. The staff is efficient and lovely, and you can always walk around Queen Street to digest afterwards.   This is definitely a nice place for a quick meal with your friends, either locals or visitors. BMB is a restaurant I will definitely eat at again!"}
{"text":"Clearly everybody loves Banh Mi Boys, and with good reason. The line-up may be long, but you won't wait for hours on end to receive your piping hot sandwiches and fries. The restaurant does have space for you to eat inside, but most people took their containers to go, choosing to eat in the comfort of their own homes instead of at the fast-food-resembling tables and chairs.  Banh Mi Boys is not terribly expensive and makes for a delicious, casual meal. The kimchi fries were a bit sour for my taste, but definitely a novel idea and worth trying out. The taco was less-than-impressive, flopping about and spilling the contents onto the checkered paper. However, the chicken banh mi was yummy- I loved the crispy yet chewy bread, and the sandwich filling was warm and generously piled in. If I'm ever back in the area I would definitely eat from here again! The other flavours sounded really interesting, like the Duck Confit Banh Mi!  Also, Kekou Gelato recently opened up right beside Banh Mi Boys. You can eat lunch here and then head on over to eat ice cream- how awesome is that? (I was not sponsored to say this. I just love Kekou's!)"}
{"text":"Seriously addicting. I highly recommend the beef cheek steamed bao."}
{"text":"Been here more than a few times. Pork belly baos are good. The Kalbi beef is a hit or miss depending on the day. Sometimes it's soft and tender, other times just overcooked and hard. Never had the kimchi fries."}
{"text":"Two words. Kimchi fries.  I love these fries - they're crispy, covered in kimchi and pulled pork, with the right amount of sauce. The kimchi isn't overpowering when you taste this. I usually get the fries to share with a friend and the five spice pork belly banh mi for myself. I've been going here for years and the quality has been consistent every time. It's still cheap and delicious to this very day!"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is a a twist on your traditional Vietnamese sandwich shop. Instead of your typical cold cut meats there is Korean and Taiwanese style meats, like braised beef, pulled pork and duck confit. There is even a southern inspired fried chicken steamed bao bun. So you take your usual Vietnamese sandwich palette and swap out the sliced pork and meatballs for something way more flavorful and higher quality.   The food here is seriously delicious. You'll want to keep coming back for more. This will no doubt become a regular stop of mine. Yum!"}
{"text":"This time I had the papaya salad and the squid banh mi. The squid banh mi was good but I wish I had more than four pieces of calamari in my sandwich.  The papaya salad was not the best I have had; only because the dressing accompanying the papaya was not very flavorful."}
{"text":"Tasty Vietnamese buns for a great price. Located just north of Dundas Square, I used to always visit to grab a quick lunch. There's a number of choices for meats that you can select. I've only had the banh mi but I've heard the baos are good as well. The fries are tasty as well. I've had the pork belly banh mi a few times and would say that's my favourite. Pricing is excellent. Fast food style restaurant where you order up front, grab your food and seat yourself. The location itself is small and seating is fairly limited so consider grab and go during the busy hours."}
{"text":"Very yummy.  Friends arrived early and ordered for us. We tried the Banh Mi Pork Belly and the Squid.  The queue gets incredibly long at lunch time so it's good to show up early."}
{"text":"BMB doesn't get raved about for nothing.  Well, besides their kimchi fries.    Their banhmi's are flavourful and filling; but honestly, only a couple notches up your supermarket banhmi's mostly because the meats are grilled fresh and the bread toasted etc.  Their real seller though, imo, are their baos and tacos.  The shells of their tacos are rotis (I think?) and not the distastefully hard ones or the limp soft ones - but so chewy and goes perfectly with whatever meats are inside.  Their five-spiced pork belly baos are also incredible.  The pickled cabbages could be a little strong for me, but everything else is juicy and impeccable.  I do not like their kimchi fries at all and don't understand the hype, because they're oily and the texture is just not right.  Aside from that, BMB is one of the best cheap eats around the area"}
{"text":"I'm from NYC. Everytime i'm up in toronto I always go here just to order kimchi fries. It is the bomb. Hands down, probably one of the top kimchi fries I've ever tasted. I've tasted better sandwiches, tacos before but their fries are honestly worth the travel to downtown toronto."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously awesome. Worth the wait in the line-up. I went here for lunch with some co-workers around 1:30 and still waited in line.  I ordered the pork belly sandwich with a side of yam fries. The fries were fine but the sandwich was amazing. Pork belly was succulent and delicious and the mixed pickled vegetables and cilantro really complimented it well.   This is going to become a regular lunch option. Though i'll have to eat off-peak lunch hours to avoid the worst line-ups."}
{"text":"The banh mi here is very different compared to back home (Boston, MA) but surprisingly very good. I tried the pulled pork, grilled pork, and meatball banh mi and they all were delicious and freshly made right in front of you! There's a lot of different selections to choose from and you can pick how spicy you want your banh mi to be. The service was fairly fast considering the fact that they're always busy and the workers were friendly and welcoming. You can either eat there or take out. Sad I didn't get the try their steamed baos and tacos but next time! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I came here a while back it's is a really good Vietnamese sandwich their best one is Kalbi beef but their duck confit was pretty good as well the kimchi fries is good but since is it eat pork I wish they could substitute with beef or chicken. I hope this place remains open for a long time because the sandwiches are delicious"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is only \"okay\" in my books. Nothing memorable, nothing special. The only good thing about this place is that their sandwiches/tacos/baos are cheap. This place would be a great place to get an affordable lunch at in downtown. I do like how Banh Mi Boys does a different take on Vietnamese sandwiches by adding meats like pork belly and kalbi beef. It is definitely unique but personally, it's just okay.   I ordered the Grilled Chicken Banh Mi and it was alright. I felt like it was kinda dry at some parts of the sandwich as the sauce wasn't distributed evenly. By the end of it, I was really thirsty. I recommend buying a drink with these sandwiches.    And again, come to Banh Mi Boys for a quick bite but don't expect it to be super memorable."}
{"text":"This is the OG spot for when I don't know what to eat, and I'm around queen street. The Braised Beef banh mi and Kalbi tacos are the bomb. The service is fast and the menu has a great selection!"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch every couple of weeks. The fried chicken, grilled pork and pork belly are all great. Try the Club Bao if you want something special (Fried chicken and Pork Belly together)"}
{"text":"Sandwiches were awesome! So much flavour! Definitely going back to try other items on the menu. Service was a little long but worth it."}
{"text":"Definitely try the kimchi fries !!! It was the highlight of my night....just thinking of that savory meat fries kimchi and gravy was soooooo delicious....other than that, the banh mi was meh, it's basically a regular banh mi but with BBQ meat such as beef or pork for $6.....it's pretty pricy if u ask me, but next time when I'm back, gonna be trying the tacos and baos....it's a really small place with only about 6 tables so be prepared to take out or eat standing"}
{"text":"First time customer long time listener! Absolutely fantastic. What a great place to grab a delicious bite of goodness. Stopped by tonight and as expected the place was fairly busy. There was only one person in front of me in line luckily but even then I waited a maximum of 3 minutes? All the tables were taken as well as the ledges if that's what there called? I ordered both the braised beef cheek and 5 spice pork belly bao. Both were fantastic and delicious and for $3.49 a piece you can't go wrong. As deceiving as the bao looks, it's fairly substantial, especially for a guy like me with hollow legs. I was content. Highly recommend this place and I'll be returning most definitely!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed! I wish they had more seating. Otherwise, an awesome spot to grab a quick bite. If the weather's warm, I recommend getting your bahn mi to go and eating it in Grange Park.   Not much to add here. I've had the tofu and the meatball bahn mi -- both are filling and delicious. I especially enjoy the tomato hoisin sauce that comes with the meatball one. Ingredients are simple and fresh. The bao are also pretty big and flavourful -- go for the pork belly! They don't give you as much meat as Momofuku but they put in more veggies. I like that they have blood orange san pellegrino here too! I have not tried the kimchi fries because the portion is huge -- I don't think I could eat a bahn mi AND kimchi fries in one sitting. Definitely a share-worthy dish!   Staff here are always friendly and never seem too stressed despite how busy it is! Also, shout outs to whoever picks the music here. It's a trip down memory lane with 90's classics. In one lunch I heard Nelly \"Ride Wit Me\", Warren G \"Regulate\", and Salt'n'Pepa \"Whatta Man\". Amazing...! :P"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Banh Mi Boys; I really wanted to love it.  Here's the thing - it was raining outside, I'd never been before, and it offered me a warm bastion from the drizzle.  We were off to a good start.  Where it falls apart is the value per dollar.  Being located on the sidelines of Chinatown demands a lot - there are few places in Canada where you can get food value per dollar like Chinatown, and Banh Mi Boys failed to live up to expectations.  $6.50 for a sandwich (which was delicious, I might add - do not doubt the tasty treat that is the food itself) but the price?  It was too much.  After finishing my fresh-made sandwich (on chewy, delightful bread) I found myself still hungry, and wanting for more.  That was less than idea.  If you're not hurting for cash, by all means check it out.  It's a Three Star if money is no option, but - again - to keep harping, for that price?  It's not worth the cramped wait, shoulder to shoulder with dozens of other people waiting on their orders.  And - be prepared to eat outside.  The tables seem to fill up fast."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and ordered the fish taco and she got the infamous kimchi fries. The fish taco was pretty good but personally, I didn't think it was worth the money. The kimchi fries were pretty good and I'd probably get that if I were going there again. Not worth going to if you're super hungry and are planning on getting a lot of food... small portions."}
{"text":"Great! Banh mi was really good value in terms of quality (fresh bread, decent meat) & portion size (large)."}
{"text":"I appreciate the consistency here. Very popular place.   But this isn't premium food. It's good, reliable banh mi or buns for a good price.   Try the Kim Chi fries!"}
{"text":"Glad I tried this once!! I was expecting some weird Asian fusion thing that leaned more on fusion than Asian, but I was pleasantly surprised.  We tried: -Kimchi fries: not as great as everyone raves about, but I love fries so I couldn't resist ordering. Huge portion, and I'm pleasantly surprised it came w/pulled pork. Just wish the fries were crispier..ours were soggy and limp. -Fried chicken bao: prolly my fave!!! Chicken was tender and juicy, perfectly seasoned and fried! -5 spice pork belly bao: nothing toooooo special, but I always get caught by the pork belly hype haha -Grilled pork banh mi: bf said this itself was a 4 star banh mi. We liked how BMB stayed true to the Vietnamese banh mi. -5 spice pork belly banh mi: just ok - the pork belly hype strikes again!  No issues with service (which was pretty limited bc all you do is order and pick up your food - you bus everything else yourself). The girl cashier was nice enough. Worth trying once! Oh yeah and remember the baos are bigger/more filling than expected - I got full off one."}
{"text":"Wow. Came here to try the braised beef banh mi and it was simply amazing. Long line ups out the door but it was certainly worth the wait. The braised beef was just so tender and the bun, carrots, and the cilantro was super fresh. Still lots of baos and kim chi fries to try. Will most definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"For $5.99, you can enjoy the Kimchi Vegetarian fries, which are a cheap thrill if you're in the area. http://www.girlabouttoronto.com/2012/10/18/today-i-daydreamed/"}
{"text":"We only had the Grilled Pork banh mi but was extremely impressed. In many other banh mi places, I am faced with one problem: hard and thick baguette. The baguette at Banh Mi Boys was of a perfect texture, and so soft. The meat was rich and fresh. Very reasonable priced as well. Small and popular venue though (even during off-hours) so grab those seats quickly!  Recently tried their kimchi fries which were absolutely delicious. Very heavy and rich in flavour. I would love to come here after a long night of bar hopping sometime to finish off with some great drunk food."}
{"text":"I love Banh Mi Boys. I live in Markham and would make a trip downtown just to crunch my craving for BMB's delicious food - That must mean some real good food! Caution: - I was in a rush to go somewhere and asked my Banh Mi to go. Bad idea girls! Unless you want to have sauce, carrot, cilantro and/or meat all over ur chin and outfit, this yummy goodie deserves the wait for a table. And guys, you guys obviously don't mind the mess, so march on! - Eat it right away! Not saying that the food taste bad if you don't eat it right when they hand it to you. The buns get a little bit soggy and the fries start to taste more like mashed potato after the food got cold - still pretty tasty.  My fave - kimchi fries for the win! aside from that, I like Banh Mi with Pork Belly the most."}
{"text":"Although the wait is worth factoring in, they're pretty quick with the line.  Love the Kimchi fries."}
{"text":"I LOVED their food and prices!!!!! The prices omg!!!!!! My ultimate favourite is the five spice pork belly bao!!!! Only $3.75!!!!!! Will definitely come back for moreeeee MORE I TELL YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Being Vietnamese my friends have been urging me to try Banh Mi Boys since they've opened their original location in the west end.  I never got around to it but now that they have a convenient location at College and Yonge, I could not say no.  I had to try the kim chi fries, because they were all the rave and I had the pork belly sandwich.  They were both delicious, and I was especially impressed by the kim chi fries because, well that was a very unique combination that didn't make me feel like I need to slather ketchup all over it.    The banh mi (sandwich) was yum but was too bread-y.  For the price, I would rather have myself a burger.  I like Vietnamese banh mi because they are usually inexpensive and tastes yummy the next day, but these ran a little pricey.  I will come back however for the kim chi fries and I will try the \"bao\" next time, which is a less bready, smaller and a less expensive version of their \"banh mi\"."}
{"text":"Simple concept , Priced right, Unique flavor, Quick service- all in all a great place for a budget lunch downtown Toronto! Try it if you are in the area! You will go back for more!"}
{"text":"I can't eat Banh Mi anywhere else. I am Vietnamese and I love the fusion meats along with daikon + carrot + cucumber baguettes. Additionally, kimchi fries are a must have! Who would have thought mixing kimchi and fries would be fantastic on the taste buds."}
{"text":"5/5 for everything. Food, service, quality and price.  I could eat this at anytime and my personal fav is the friend chicken bao, and pork belly bao and all the banh mi sandwiches.  Kalbi beef tacos are also amazing.  Pro tip: gets busy during rush hour, and be prepared to have itis for the rest of your day :)"}
{"text":"Took a fairly arduous TTC streetcar-during-rush-hour ride after work after reading a number of fairly positive reviews about Banh Mi Boys to see if it was worth all the pork-bellied hype (and to harshly judge if it was truly a foodier version of the tasty $2.00 Banh Mi Ba Le pork subs at Dundas & Spadina).  SInce this was my first visit to BMB, I never got the chance to experience it in its original layout, but I was instantly impressed with the modern, but friendly design of their new renovations. Flat screen menu monitors were a nice touch too. Place is a little small; definitely more of a grab-and-go lunch spot.   As you might've guessed by now, I ordered a 5-Spice Pork Belly Banh Mi, which came out to $7.00, without a drink. Reasonable. But  I wasn't expecting a solid 5-10 minute wait and when I was asked how spicy I preferred my sub to be, my Banh Mi artist needed clarification on what \"Sriracha\" was. A colleague, clearly more experienced in Thai/Vietnamese cuisine quickly corrected her. \"Standard hot sauce,\" he said. True story.   Upon initial sandwich incision, I was instantly caught by the wonderful crunchy/fluffiness of the french baguette, the quality of which is vital to a legit Banh Mi. But it was the fine balance of cilantro, shredded carrots, pickled daikon and the tender, absolutely flavorful pork belly that really did it for me.   Devoured my sub with an unhealthy hastiness on a sunny walk back home through Bellwoods, but all I could think about was how long it would be so I could go back to BMB to try the Kimchi Fries (I am a Kimchi aficionado), one of their steamed slider-buns or perhaps the lemongrass-tofu Banh Mi."}
{"text":"If you want some great food, and not break the bank in Downtown Toronto this is the place to go. I haven't tried much Vietnamese food, but I will try it again, this place was amazing.   i am not sure what Kimchi is, but the Kinchi fries were amazing, I knew I was getting full but I couldn't stop myself.  Both my girlfriend and I got something  and shared the Kimchi fries and the bill didn't  get anywhere close to $20 and we both got bottled waters."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean environment and reasonably priced beverages (ex. $1.25 for water & canned soda, $1.75 for San Pellegrino) Food is as good as other locations, I just wish it was open a bit later (to 10pm during the week.) Well executed panko tofu bao: not greasy, toppings and condiments did not overpower and bao was soft and fresh."}
{"text":"I've been to this location three times and it's always been the same girl operating the cash register.  She's really patient and polite.  The cooks seem polite although I've had very little interaction with them.  The food is consistently good and tasty fast food.  I've tried their sandwiches (kalbi ribs twice and pork), as well kimchee poutine and papaya salad.  The kalbi beef is decent quality and not full of fat.  I've been to their College/Yonge location a couple of times a few years back too."}
{"text":"I was new to Bahn Mi, but the Boys definitely made me a fan. The sandwich was inexpensive, and so good that I packed the uneaten half of it up for the following day's train ride to Montreal.   Unless you're incredibly hungry, I would probably suggest *either* a sandwich *or* the Kimchi fries... the portions are generous, and having both was far too much food for me.   Ordering was easy - put in your order and pay at the counter, get in the little line along the wall, and wait for them to call your name. They'll ask if you want it for here or to go, and how spicy you'd like your meal (check the chart on the front of the counters - they've got several posted). Once you've hashed that out, you should have your delicious food in just a minute or two. Easy, cheap, and delicious. If I lived in Toronto, I'd be back again and again."}
{"text":"Why does Toronto have everything cool including sub shop names? Taking a traditional food item and throwing boy at the end generates appeal to a wider audience than just xx banh mi shop and I'm jealous Calgary doesn't have something as cool.  Anyways, moving onto the actual restaurant itself, I actually haven't tried any of the banh mi here. Names aside, I still believe Calgary has better overall viet food so I've only tried the baos and tacos here's.  Yes, like most Toronto restaurants there is an element of fusion here and it most definitely works.  The baos are some of my favorite in the city. There is just so much depth and flavor in each of them that I would be remiss not to have one at least once everytime I'm in Toronto. With fresh white buns that are never chewy or stale, BMB has managed to season all of the baos stuffing so well that the blandness of the bao works in conjunction with the saltiness of the protein to bring it to a perfect balance (I find most places season stuffing for taste by itself, forgetting that the bao can undercut the stuffings flavor,  and as a result create an overall bland product). Of the 6 or so various baos, my absolute favorite is the fried chicken bao.  Strangely, as someone who doesn't enjoyed fried foods much, the oiliness of the fried chicken in the steamed bao just works wonders for me. The pork belly is also good, but so rich I'd recommend it as a shared item between two people.  Tacos here are also done well but of the two, I prefer the baos much more.   For its unique bao and taco offerings, BMB is a must try. I haven't seen another restaurant in Canada with similar offerings, so check this place out!"}
{"text":"Banh Mi is that place to go when you want to spend five bucks on some trendy food and feel pretty satisfied afterwards.    Look,  this isn't some fancy shmancy place, but hot dang it's tasty.  The menu is small and simple.    I've had the pork belly sandwich,  Kimchi fries,  and spicy pork belly steamed bao.  Pork belly sandwich: good,  filling,  generous on the meat portions.  A little bit plain and could use more sauce and less bread,  but well priced and decent.    Kimchi fries: I will return just for these fries. These are life changing. Get them with some spice,  you won't regret it.    Pork belly steamed bao: really well priced,  very very delicious.  Get these over the sandwiches!  May Update: PLEASE get the kalbi sandwich. I take back my previous sandwich comment as long as you get this one! IT'S AWESOME."}
{"text":"Was very excited to finally try this place out as I loved Bahn mi's. I got the squid Bahn mi, fried chicken bao and kimchi fries. The Bahn was perfect. It was very different and tasty and the squid was cooked and fried perfectly. The bao was very interesting as it didn't look appetizing at first until I took my first bite and I couldn't get enough of it. The only star lost were the kimchi fries. Don't get me wrong, It was good but the fries were kinda old, stale, burnt, and soggy... The pork and kimchi was really good though, but for a price of 6.50, I at least expected some nice perfectly cooked fries, especially where the fries make up the whole entire dish! With that said, I would definitely come back again when I go downtown."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite go to places for banh mi and baos.  Really good stuff!  Small eat in area but available for delivery."}
{"text":"I tried the five-spice pork belly banh mi and the beef kalbi banh mi; both very flavourful and delicious but I found the beef kalbi one to be a little too salty for my liking. I believe they were priced at $6.50 and $7 respectively; a little pricey compared to the traditional banh mi's you can find in Chinatown!  There are about a dozen tables but I can imagine that it can get quite packed during lunch hours. Banh Mi Boys is definitely a nice change to the McDonald's, Chipotle and other traditional burger/French fry options in the area.  The kimchi fries looked quite amazing too, will have to make a trip back to try them!"}
{"text":"Went to BMB to try their secret menu \"club bao\" experience...and what an experience it was.  The bao itself is a great mix of chicken, pork and veggies and spice. Completely worth the title of being a \"secret menu item\". Tip for the location is to grab your food to go and then find a park to relax in...as the locations are known to be a bustling environment and not a lot of seating."}
{"text":"Ordered the bulgogi taco and split an order of kimchi fries. Portions are big and everything was flavorful. Felt like Asian fusion comfort food."}
{"text":"I love this place; i come to this location or the one near yonge and dundas at least once per month. My go to is always the duck confit bahn mi with medium heat (siracha) - it is so tasty and the pickled carrots, cilantro, cucumber, bread - it's a perfect combination. If I'm getting just the duck bahn mi, I also like to get the jicama slaw too - the dressing is a little spicy. Other favorites of mine are the fried chicken steamed bun, the beef steamed bun and the kimchi fries - all super tasty. And everyone I come here with always loves the kimchi fries. Pricing is also not bad; dinner for 2 with a can of pop is around $25. The only annoying this is that their hours a little short in the evening."}
{"text":"Had a line when we went here for lunch on Friday but it moved quickly and the food was prepared quite fast as well! I got the tofu fries and fried chicken Bao. The tofu fries had kimchi, french fries, pieces of tofu, and topped with mayo and Sriracha - super yum!!! The tofu was seasoned well and fries were good, a bit soggy but very flavourful. The fried chicken Bao though was my favourite! The Bao was soft, and overall the dish was so full of flavor, crunchy, and quite filling. Definitely recommend this Bao and to try the tofu fries if you come here!"}
{"text":"Why aren't the fries crispy???  Just found that to be so strange.  I liked that they were skin-on fries but they were all so limp.  That's what the fryer is for, no?  Got the grilled pork and grilled chicken bahn mi.  Grilled pork was the winner.  Guess if you live around the area, you have thousand more chances to walk back in here and try everything on their menu.    The kids that were cooking on the line didn't look to happy, nor did they speak a word to each other...  Strange.  Maybe they hate working there because they're so busy all the time.  The girl at the register was nice but she kept saying sandwich when I kept saying banh mi.  Lol. Whatevers. Kids.  Go try it, it's pretty yummy.  Good luck finding a seat during peak hours.  And watch out for kimchi breath!"}
{"text":"The prices were amazing for the amount of food we got. Don't let the cheap prices scare you though. The quality of the food is amazing as well! If I lived in Canada I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I preface this with the caveat that I'm a vegetarian. By design. Banh Mi style food isn't usually great for me. That said, there are a few veggie friendly items on the menu that because my carnivore friends all RAVE about this place, I decided to join and try out. Once.  I had the tofu tacos. Meh. Tasteless, even with the mayo and kimchi, the tortilla was a bit dry and too thick and the tofu had nothing to it. I had the sweet potato fries with it and I found them incredibly greasy and I didn't finish them. Which is saying something, I loves me any kind of fries.  If you're a carnivore - by all means, eat your heart out. I hear the pulled pork buns are to die for. The lunch line up is indicative of everyone else's support so please don't let my review deter you. It's just not for me."}
{"text":"Whoa, can you say hot commodity?!  My friend recommended place & looking at all the reviews, I knew I had try this out.  The bulgogi banh mi. OMG, thick cuts of marinated beef perfectly paired with kimchi, carrots, cucumbers & cilantro! Completely refreshing yet meaty in every bite. And boy, the Banh Mi Boys do not kid when they say spicy! Luckily I love the heat & the addition of sriracha hot sauce & jalepeno peppers brought up the temp! And that baguette? Perfectly crispy on the outside yet soft & fluffy on the inside. Yum. Delish!  The five spice pork belly bao was amazing. Two perfectly marinated thick slices of pork belly encased in a soft white rice bun?! HELL YES.  Fast service. Just get in there like swimwear!"}
{"text":"The food here is unexpectedly good! The bun I'm bao is something you should definitely try here as it is a different twist to the traditional Vietnamese Banh mi/ Vietnamese sub sandwiches. Also try the kimchi fries - I'm not very good with spicy personally but the kimchi fried are not too spicy, the taste and the hint of spice add flavour to the fries and it's a taste you can't distinguish but it is worth what you get."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys was probably one of the first places I bookmarked when I was looking for Toronto goodies. My friends who've been spoke very highly of it (without overselling lol) and I knew I definitely need to make a stop. We were able to pass by before we needed to head to the airport (yes, I brought it home to Miami with me lol). The shop we went to was on Queen and near our AirBnB. It was a small space and we JUST beat the Monday lunch rush so there wasn't much of a wait but I can see the line going out the door for a little during that rush.  I ordered the grilled pork and 5-spice pork belly banh mis. My favorite was the grilled pork, HANDS DOWN. The pork belly was good too but the grilled pork had so much flavor! Always make sure you ask for veggies on the side if you're not going to eat it sooner than later.  I wish I had time (and belly room) to try their kimchi fries because I do love my fries but until next time! The kalbi beef taco is also on my list."}
{"text":"I fell in love with banh mi sandwiches every since my mom brought two home from a Chinatown institution for these wonders. Every other banh mi that I've had since have needed to live up to that moment. But as you may know by now from all the other glowing reviews, these are not your normal banh mi sandwiches. I had to throw my preconceptions out the window for my first Banh Mi Boys experience. Don't come here expecting cold cuts and paté, but do expect savoury, deeply flavoured meats and tofu. The pork belly, kimchi fries and grilled pork are all excellent, but what's really surprising is the lemongrass tofu. The deep fried tofu provides enough of a meaty bite and the lemongrass balances well with the pickled carrots and daikon. I ask for mine medium, which means a quick squirt of sriracha, but if you want to go adventurous..ask for the habaneros. PS...I would also recommend the papaya and jicama salad, it's light, crisp and full of umami!"}
{"text":"Great Viet sandwiches for decent prices! It's not exactly a sit down place as there's limited seating. Love the early 2000s hip hop music they play in the restaurant as it brings back good high school memories. Kimichi fries are a must to try as well. Service is fast and efficient. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I have eaten banh mi, but wow these boys really put a twist on their banh mi. My boyfriend got the five-spice pork belly banh mi. This is the best seasoned pork belly ever. I got the five-spice pork belly banh mi & fried chicken steamed bun. Both were delicious. I also like how you can tell them how spicy you would like your banh mi, bun, and etc. Good atmosphere. Only problem is this is a small space, so it is hard to find a place to sit down."}
{"text":"The low rating is for the cashier and not the food.  I actually love the kimchi fries and bahnmi/baos here. Kimchi fries is a must each time I go. food wise, definitely 4/5 stars.  However, this specific location's cashier is a bit of a pain. I'm referring to the Asian girl who works cash. She is expressionless, does not make eye contact when taking orders, and has screwed up my orders on more than 1 occasion. I'm sure it's not due to being new since she's been there for a while, but the general vibe is that she's not friendly at all and doesn't want to be there. Definitely the last type of person you want to be greeting your business' clients.  If you have to go here then go, but I'd recommend the location at Queen/Spadina. Went there yesterday, everyone was super friendly and an overall positive experience."}
{"text":"Great baos - i would recommend the beef (so tender) and chicken options. I didn't like the salad though."}
{"text":"One word. AH-MAZING!  My boyfriend and I went to Toronto for the weekend and decided to try a bunch of hole in the wall places while we were here and we came across this place and it was amazingly good. For the price and the size of the banh mi it was well worth the 20 minute walk from where we were saying. Even eating the left overs 4 hours later was still good, and that's when you know it's good. The bread they used was not like the original bread made with banh mi, it was like the French baguette texture.  We ordered the pork belly banh mi and the pulled pork banh mi with a side of kimchi fries. And they were all amazing. The kimchi fries were absolutely delicious. We even had to stop there before we left Toronto for our last meal before heading home.   When in Toronto, I highly recommend:)"}
{"text":"That was and experinece. Love it. Had the duck confit banh mi and it was amazing. Enjoyed every bite of that sandwich. long line ups at rush hours, but truly worth it in my opinion. Every bite was like an adventure. How did I not go there sooner is a mystery"}
{"text":"So delicious! I typically am disappointed by restaurants that have received a lot of buzz, but Banh Mi Boys was an exception!  We got the five spice pork belly banh mi, tofu taco, and kim chi fries. Everything was delicious! Although we left a bit too full because of the fries, they were really unique and everyone should try them at least once!  My only complaint is that the layout at this location is really terrible when they're busy. The line of people waiting for food merges with the line of people waiting to order, and the lines also block the seats."}
{"text":"I think the best way to describe this place is \"rock-star\". Absolutely awesome. It's inexpensive, delicious, fast and the staff are friendly and ridiculously efficient. It is my favorite restaurant in Toronto. I wonder if they have a meal plan? If I lived nearby, I probably wouldn't use my kitchen.  Not too much seating space inside though, but that's o.k. You will be so ravenous when you get your delicious food you will probably finish it before you get to a table anyway."}
{"text":"Ever eat at a place that makes you seriously consider quitting your job and opening your own original-concept franchise before it takes off?  BMB is that kind of place. Banh mi sandwich rolls tumble out of a conveyor belt in front of you, while you eagerly wait for your name to be called from behind the high-walled counter. Despite limited seating, most orders are taken out, even at peak lunch hours, making dining-in a reasonable possibility.   As good as the sub-type banh mi ($5.50) are, the bao sandwiches may be even better - certainly a very unique concept (for someone from Miami at least) with amazing fried chicken, or 5-spice pork belly in a squishy white pocket. 2 of these would give great variety and value for a meal (3.50 each)  But my new contender for \"Taste of the Year\" has to be the kimchi fries ($6): an unlikely gestalt (whole greater than sum of parts) of: fries, topped with kimchi, pulled BBQ pork, green onions and mystery mayo.  Wow. Go with a group, so that you don't have to choose between this Asian/Southern mash-up, and any of the amazing little sandwiches.   I don't doubt there will be more BMB locations the next time I'm in Toronto - hopefully one in the east-end (scarborough), if they are reading ;)"}
{"text":"This place is the best place to get your Vietnamese sandwich. The price are reasonable for the food.. My favourite are Grilled Pork Banh Mi and fried chicken steam bao really tasty and yummy. Worth every dimes I've spent on at this restaurant."}
{"text":"A great place for take out lunch.    The locale: very cramped.  They have 5 tables that each seat two.  Would not recommend for dining in.  Service: you order your food, wait next a busy bar for them to call your name so you can choose the spiciness.  There is no table service.    Food: for just over 10$ you can get a sandwich and sweet potatoes fries.  The sandwich by itself is not enough for a full meal.  The sandwich is on a soft baguette, with lots of carrots and cilantro.  It is very juicy and tasty."}
{"text":"When I worked in the area, I went to this place weekly. Typically you have to pay more money for food that tastes this good.  I've never tried any of the tacos, but I have had a large variety of the banh mis (viet subs) and steamed baos. I would recommend the steamed baos, as the buns are soft and pillowy. And at 3.49 the price cannot be beat. The combination of crispy fried chicken, contrasting the pillowy soft bun is irresistible. And if you like spicy, get spicy! On top of all of this, they have their kimchi fries which is like Korean poutine. (fries, pulled pork, kimchi, mayo, green onions). It sounds weird but I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The braised pork was delicious!  The 5-spice pork was enjoyed by my boyfriend.  We each started with Bahn Mi and he went up to order a steamed sandwich with the 5-spice pork.  He enjoyed it more than the Bahn Mi.  We also ordered a jicama and papaya salad which was okay.  We both kind of wished we would have ordered the tacos.  The tortillas looked so good and soft.  As far as seating, it's a bit crowded, but tables open up frequently.  There's lots of shopping available on this street so this is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat if you've shopped up an appetite."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place. I think I've literally tried everything off their menu and even the secret menu items. Food is always fresh and very flavorful. A great balance of Asian fusion and tasty modernization of classic Asian foods.    Prices are super affordable, especially for the amount of meat you get in your baos and tacos. My usual order consists of beef cheek bao, kalbi taco and kimchi fries.  Always satisfied when I come here. I would say its a must to have eaten at Banh mi boys at least once if you live in the city."}
{"text":"Delicious, but overpriced vietnamese sandwiches.  Bow down to Kimchi Fries though!!!   4 stars because they don't clean their tables as frequently as they should."}
{"text":"Delicious, but overpriced vietnamese sandwiches.  Bow down to Kimchi Fries though!!!   4 stars because they don't clean their tables as frequently as they should."}
{"text":"Cheap-ish?  Check.  Quick-ish?  Check.  Delicious?  Definitely, check.  I ordered the Kim Chi Fries (to share), a Squid Taco, & a Pork Belly Bao.  And even though it was a late dinner, sharing the fries + the squid taco was enough for me.  (I save the bao for lunch the next day!)  Both items were fresh tasting and were ready shortly after ordering.  The only thing that was somewhat lacking was the cramped seating area.  It was raining that day and another patron left their umbrella in the aisle because - I'm assuming - there was no other place for it.  One of my friends almost tripped on it while walking out.    So clearly BMB is meant for quick eating/takeout more than a nice, sitdown meal at a leisurely pace."}
{"text":"This rating is specifically for ordering takeout over the phone. They never pick it up. I love the food, but trying to order over the phone is a nightmare. I am not in their delivery zone so I have to drive there, unfortunately cannot park and wait there. Please do not provide your phone number if you are not going to pick it up."}
{"text":"Very tasty sandwich shop! Kimchi fries and Kalbi sandwich are the bomb.  Fresh food and quick service"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places to eat in the city. I always get the squid banh mi and I never get sick of it. I recently tried the pork belly bao after recommendations from a few friends and I really enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend eating at Banh Mi Boys more than once."}
{"text":"Pretty much every time my boyfriend and I meet up after work, we find ourselves here. It's that good. So far we've tried the banh mi's, steamed bao's and taco's; I feel like the banh mi's are the best. Don't get me wrong, the bao's and taco's are excellent as well. But I prefer to get the banh mi cause the bread is just downright awesome. It's soft, but the exterior is so crunchy. Everytime we come here, we get the usual Five Spice Pork Belly Banh Mi and of course, the kimchi fries (boyfriend just lives for that stuff). I like the Five Spice the most cause the Pork belly is cooked to perfection, still so moist and super flavorful and the pickled radish, cucumber is so refreshing it has you wanting more. The kimchi fries are just.. awesome. I don't know how to describe how good it is - it just is.  Also, don't anticipate on finding a table to sit at here. Not much seating room.  The stuff here is dangerously good."}
{"text":"Great food.  This is unrelated but it kinda looked like the male workers were wearing make up, good bahn mi's nonetheless..."}
{"text":"Should have given it a 4 but you'll understand once you order their squid taco. That's the only disappointment."}
{"text":"Very good banh mi and for a decent price too. Good selection of meat and variety. You can choose to eat there or take out, generally takes about 10-15 minutes for the food. Usually there's a line up so you know it's popular. You can choose how spicy you want too.  Overall, it's one of my favorite go to places when I just want to grab something that's delicious and for a good price. Check out the Kimchi Fries with sweet potato fries :)"}
{"text":"The service is declining from my last few experiences. They pack the food sloppily (my fries were packed upside down and fell everywhere in the bag before i even opened it) and they forgot to add some of the sides I asked (e.g., mayo for my sweet potato fries). The chef making my sandwich was also pretty rude to me for some reason. I used to give this place five stars but it has been very disappointing lately.. Don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for a quick bite before a night on the town; it was my fist time. Although the line was long don't be discouraged the wait isn't really that long. I ordered the panko steamed bao which was delicious. Unfortunately I asked for hot and it was not hot at all; next time I'll spike it up a bit. As a side I got the tofu fries with extra kimchi. Hopefully with my next visit I'll boost this up to a 5 star after trying the sandwich or taco, so much to try!   See you soon."}
{"text":"Awesome Vietnamese subs and sweet potato fries!!! I love the bahn mi so much that I haven't tried their tacos or steamed bao, but I've heard people raving about those too (:"}
{"text":"In love with this place.  Really amazing sandwiches and bao, with any of the meats - braised beef, pork belly, squid, duck.   The fries are also super good and a meal on their own.  Been there a million times and it's always amazing!  Not a lot of seating if you go at lunch time, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"We dem Bahn Mi Boys - we makin Noise!!!!  If Wiz Khalifa ate at this joint he would have a quick remix sesh to the banger above.   That Chicken Bao is life changing. I would fight a legion of 2ft mini raptors in outer space to have another Chicken Bao touch my lips. To bad these cats don't deliver to Long Beach!  The Bahn Mi was delicious too - I docked a star due to the place being messy. It was dinner time, but someone needs to do a quick table wiping and sweep up of the joint before it gets too lit."}
{"text":"Five spice pork belly banh mi ... Worth.every.penny. The pork belly is so flavorful. Aside from the food, I want to commend their friendly staff and clean shop. Thanks to yelp , I found this delish food place."}
{"text":"The first time I had BMB was in downtown (the dundas one near Ryerson) couple years ago. It was a lot busier, and I remember the Banh Mi stuffed with meat and veggies. This time, I got the Duck Confit Banh Mi and Kimchi Fries. The Banh Mi came in your regular huge Viet bun size, enough to last me a meal and half. It was still stuffed with all the veggies but the meat seems to reduce significantly. I still prefer the sketchy Chinatown Banh Mis a bit more, for a cheaper price too. Kimchi fries were good, will probably get them again when I go back.  It's not a tiny store, they have couple seats and tables around the restaurant. It gives off a \"fast food restaurant\" vibe but you'll definitely have to wait longer than that for your food."}
{"text":"After a great sandwich at porcetta, the bar has been set high.  Banh mi boys did not really live up to the hype. I had the pork belly sandwich, it had good amount of tanginess, crunch, fresh cilantro, nice juicy pork belly slices, a modern update on the Vietnamese sandwich (no spam meat here) pulled pork kimchi fries was too sweet and the kimchi was not spicy at all."}
{"text":"The steam beef cheeks baos are the best thing ever. Only wish the place was bigger."}
{"text":"Good casual option for Vietnamese fusion food. Yeah, the restaurant could use more cleaning, but the food is tasty.  BAHN MI - Grilled pork ($5.50)- pork was sweet, sandwich is soft and warm rather than the typical room temp bahn mi with a crispy baguette  BAO - Five spice pork belly ($3.75)- bao is quite large, and the pork belly was tender and flavorful  SIDES - Kimchi fries ($6.50)- pulled pork was really good, fries were crispy - Jicama papaya salad ($3)- kind of bland, mostly jicama, not really a traditional papaya salad with the pungent fish sauce"}
{"text":"It's dangerous that this place is right downstairs from where I live. If I'm feeling a meal or a snack, this is just a ritual away. Make sure you check out their secret menu on ritual too, they have a club bao which is their fried chicken and 5 spice pork belly and they also have duck confit bao. I always like how consistent this place is, never had a bad experience and I've gone countless times. Also if you're a spice lover like me, instead of getting medium hot or extra hot, you can actually request combinations of spices (habaneros and jalapeños)."}
{"text":"This place is so great, I love it. My good friend lives around the corner, and introduced me to this place and now I even go without her.   It's filling, tasty and cheap! What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Everyone knows this place is great so I don't need to mention that! But as someone of a Vietnamese background, it makes me cringe to see their prices of a banh mi sandwich. So I usually got for the baos, they just seem to hit the spot every time! I recommend the fried chicken and pork belly.  Wait can be long sometimes, but that's expected given the location and hype around the restaurant now.   Definitely recommend if you haven't tried yet (but if you haven't, where have you been?!)"}
{"text":"This place.  This is good.  This is very, very good.  The staff?  Friendly, welcoming, will provide recommendations if it's your first time there.  The place?  Clean, lots of tables (though it fills up quickly during dinner rushes).  The food?  I've only ever tried the five-spice pork belly banh mi, but let me tell you - it's love.  I asked for it spicy and it wasn't overly spicy; it had a nice kick to it.  Overall?  GOOD."}
{"text":"I'm so glad someone told me about this place during my trip to Toronto. The food here is amazing. I've been told it was featured in some tv show. The food is very reasonably priced. We ordered the kimchi fries, which was a huge portion and should be shared, spicy chicken tacos and a 5 spice pork belly steamed bao. The fries was topped with kimchi, pulled pork and kewpie sauce. So full of flavor! The tacos was yummy, I want to come back to try all of them! The steamed bao came with a generous piece of pork belly and the bao was moist. Food came out fast despite the line to order keeps growing. Great food and great on your wallet."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick snack coming from Yorkville with my boyfriend and we've been to the Banh Mi boys at Queen & Spadina in the past and definitely had a pleasant experience when this place was extremely popular. I love the idea of a fusion between Vietnamese & Korean food.   Kalbi beef is my favorite, so I ordered the Kalbi beef banh mi, which was absolutely juicy, tasty with enough seasoning. My boyfriend ordered the braised beef cheek which was really salty and not yummy at all.   It's a decent take out place, there was no line, the service was a bit slow, and the seating area is enough to fit about 20 people max...so if it's busy, take it to go!!!!"}
{"text":"Love everything. The tacos, the bao and the banh mi. All were plenty sauced and full of flavor. The 5 spice in the pork belly will definitely kick you in the taste buds. One of the best dinner choices I've made while visiting."}
{"text":"An addictive, hip take on the Vietnamese sandwich, with crisply fresh food, upbeat atmosphere, good tunes.  Just had the 5-spice pork belly steamed bao bun while sitting watching people come and go from age & every culture imaginable. The duck confit banh mi looks mouthwatering. Punjabi couple next to me recommends the Kimchi Poutine.    Yeah, this is an example of what I like best about Toronto."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys really hit the spot when I was craving a good old Vietnamese sandwich. I stuck with the grilled pork banh mi with no mayo which was a great choice because the sandwich bread and the meat were juicy enough! My friend and I also split the kimchi fries. It was the first time I've had them and it was so weirdly good that it was hard to stop eating. We were both super full after a late dinner. If I lived around here, I would definitely frequent Banh Mi Boys quite a bit!"}
{"text":"There aren't many places in the city that make delicious bao, but banh mi boys definitely does. Definitely try their fried chicken bao if you get a chance. Every time I eat there their food always seems very fresh, which is refreshing to see from a fast food joint."}
{"text":"OH-MY-GAWD  I'm not a big foodie person, but this is one of two places we ate at while in Toronto that gets 5 stars.  It was sooo delicious, that we visited this place TWICE!!!    I've said it in other reviews before, but I don't really care for Asian food, but when you fuse it with one of my favorite foods, Mexican...it's a whole different story!    The first time we went, my boyfriend got the pork belly banh mi which I thought I wouldn't like since it sounded fatty and an order of sweet potato fries.  I got a kalbi taco to be safe.  After taking my first bite of the banh mi, I was in loooooove!  It was so moist and flavorful, not fatty at all either.  Then I tried the taco.  It couldn't have been any better!  It was juicy and spicy, the perfect combo for me.  My boyfriend typically doesn't even like sweet potato fries but he ended up really enjoying that as well.    The second time we visited, which is also the same day we were leaving Toronto, the boyfriend and I ordered a grilled pork banh me, pork belly bao, kalbo taco, and sweet potato fries.  It was A LOT of food, but we wanted to make sure we got our fix before leaving Toronto. The second time around was just as good as the first time, if not better.  I wish they had something like this in Los Angeles :("}
{"text":"I suggest eating in when grabbing a sandwich from this place (if you can, it gets pretty freaking busy). When you order takeout, the stuff in the sandwich doesn't lineup as well and you might end up getting all the meat on one side and all the vegetables on the other.  I've had the pork belly and kalbi beef banh mi, tastes great. Sandwich also comes out really quickly. They sell bottled Coke here!"}
{"text":"Good price for a quick bite in the neighbourhood. If you go to ryerson university, it is probably one of the go to food places for a good meal.  Its not too expensive despite their location.  Only problem i had was when a crazy lady came into the store and no one was there to stop her."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is the thing I miss most about Toronto. Cheap and delicious! Try the Kimchi Poutine if you want your tastebuds to explode in the best way possible!"}
{"text":"After hearing some good reviews of Banh Mi Boys I went out of way to stop by and grab and sandwich. I am so glad I did.  The Five Spice Pork Belly banh mi is one of the best sandwiches in the city, Great flavour, fresh toppings and don't forget to ask for luck sauce and some cabbage and kimchi.  The guys behind are super friendly. And they have cherry coke! Yes, it's a little more expensive the the standard \"Vietnamese sub\" found around town but it is so, so worth it.  Banh Mi Boys is going to be my new go-to for grabbing a bite to eat in the Queen/Spadina area."}
{"text":"- terribly disappointed by the lack of air conditioning in this place (hopefully, i just went on a day when the ac was broken and this isn't a regular occurence) -for the meat eaters: KIMCHI FRIES are better than the braised beef cheek banh mi - for the vegetarians: VEGGIE KIMCHI FRIES are way better than the lemongrass tofu banh mi...just skip the banh mi and get the kimchi fries (the portion is large enough to feed you)  bottom line: food is great and highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you have never had the pleasure of eating a Vietnamese Banh Mi sandwich.. well then I recommend heading to the Banh Mi Boys and ordering the Five Spice pork sandwich with the Kimchee Fries and be prepared to have your mind blown! Yes, I said Kimchee Fries with hot sauce!!! Boom!"}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot better, from all the hype that it was getting.  It was actually really bad. And this is coming from someone who eats Banh Mi's quite a lot in Chinatown.  My sandwich was quite dry, I got the duck confit. And my friend got the pork belly bahn mi.  Surprisingly there wasn't much flavor at all. It was just a really bland dry sandwich.  We also got the tofu fries, which was really different from what we were expecting. There was only like a few pieces of tofu and a lot of fries. I was expecting like tofu fried like fries or something like that."}
{"text":"I tried the grilled chicken banh mi sandwich and it was absolutely delicious.  Prices here are very reasonable, slightly on the cheaper/more affordable side. Service is also good, nothing special.   The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was cash only. I hope this is just temporary as I'd like to go back but I never have cash on me. Ill be back to try more of their products."}
{"text":"I think I expected a more traditional banh mi shop. This place serves the modern hipster Korean fusion version of banh mi. I tried it anyway and it was not bad, but it was more like a bulgogi sandwich than anything."}
{"text":"I had the duck confit. It was ok. I enjoyed the Kalbi beef sandwich better.   As other have said the kimchi fries were amazing. I would go back just for that.   Drinks were standard coke bottles with a few  exotic juices.   I would go again if in the area."}
{"text":"Had to stop in and try the hype! And the hype is real! Good flavors and the sit in front of the open door a good spot to eat while people watching!"}
{"text":"What a different little banh mi place. I can see what all the hype has been about. Its another one of Toronto's little gems. They have to have the best Boas in town. Melts in your mouth. And at those prices you can have as many as your gluttonous heart desires."}
{"text":"Best Banh Mi in Toronto! This is not an exaggeration. I have been to Toronto a few times an every trip includes a trip to Banh Mi Boys. They have three locations throughout the city: Queen St. Yonge and I think another on Yonge.  This place is legendary. They offer up unique banh mi with anything from pork belly to fried chicken. They also have various types of fries - pork belly kimchi fries, sweet potato, regular and more. But the best thing is the bao. I LIVE for their bao.  They do have a vegetarian option -- the lemon grass tofu banh mi, which can be made vegan without the spicy mayo. My friend and I split that and then we also got two bao buns with tofu. The bao is fantastic here. At most places I've had bao, it's quite small, but their bao buns are HUGE in comparison. They also use a panko-crusted tofu which adds so much flavor and texture to the soft bun.   Prices are very reasonable here because a banh mi is $6, bao is like $3 (1 bao/order) and then fries are another $3. So for one banh mi, two bao, order of fries and two drinks I spent about $20. Definitely a win.   Wait times can be a bit of a thing here. They don't take reservations and you might have to wait in line to place your order, then wait for a table to open up, but it's worth it! We chanced it around 8pm on a Thursday and there was no wait! GO HERE. YOU WON'T BE SORRY."}
{"text":"Finally made it here! Had the pork belly bao! So yummy. Loved the fresh cilantro and pickled veggies. Best thing ever."}
{"text":"Although this place specializes in banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich), I got the fried chicken steamed bao instead. And it was delicious!! The chicken was fried to perfection with a light layer of breading, sandwiched in a steam bun with some pickled carrots, cilantro and a hint of buttered mayo. Best fried chicken bun I've ever had! I will definitely go back again but next time I'll try their banh mi along with the steamed bun.  We also had the kimchi fries and jicama papaya salad. The kimchi fries wasn't as good as I expected. For me, I'll pass on that. The papaya salad was decent. They had this sweet brown sauce on the side. I don't recommend pouring the whole thing in the salad just because it got a little too sweet towards the end. Wish they had some hot chili pepper to go with it."}
{"text":"came for a quick bit to eat, love this little place! It's a diffent twist to a taco. The soft delish dough with the mix of pulled beef and the spices are out of this world the spicy pork belly is a fav of mine ! The fried chicken bao is another fave. Filling enough for a lunch and a quick easy spot!"}
{"text":"I can't even remember how many times I went there. Pork belly and kimchi fries are my fav! Every time must ordered! The pork is juicy and tender~soooooooooooooooo yummy! The kimchi fries also amazing. I love the marinate pork slices mixed with kimchi, and some green onions and mayo on the top! This is a good place for snack or lunch, not pricy but so yum and filling! I will keep visiting there!"}
{"text":"Fresh, quick, and easy. the interior and atmosphere reminds of a fast food chain, but thats beyond the point. their Bahn Mi's, i've tried the Chicken and lemongrass Tofu, are fantastic and fresh. I never eat carrots or cucumbers ever, but it just seems to work at this place.  Their Kimchi Fries are hearty, almost too filling and heavy. But the Bahn Mi's, fantastic."}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable, consistent.   Been here at the OG location at least 5 times and I keep coming back. Kim Chi Fries and Five Spice Pork Belly on anything is amazing. The pork belly comes full of flavour and the fat creates a nice crust around the meat.   These guys know how to combine good foods with good food. The tacos are underrated. Instead of a tortilla, these guys use a Malaysian flat bread called Roti Canai. Soft texture and packed with flavour.   I highly recommend this place to anyone.   Do note, this review does not apply to the Yonge-Girard location. Been there twice and its just not as good. Quality and atmosphere is lacking"}
{"text":"Always my go-to place for cheap, tasty snacks. I highly recommend their fried chicken bao, spicy pork belly bao, and kalbi taco!"}
{"text":"Excellent spot for lunch.  Squid tacos and kimchi fries were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Love this place.   Kimchi on fries?! You can not go wrong. MMmmm soo good.  The fries plus one of their steamed bun sandwiches make a great lunch and good value as well.  I opted for the tofu fries and the tofu steamed bun and was satisfied.  So good.   Seemed to be cash only when I was there, so you've been warned."}
{"text":"This place loses a star for uncleanness. Walked in for the first time ever yesterday and the place was filthy. Remnants of food were scattered on the floor, tables were not wiped clean, and the hygienic practices from staff were questionable. The cook (a white guy) went from cooking raw beef to sweeping the floor and back again to toasting sandwiches without washing his hands. I was so disturbed by that sight, I prayed he wouldn't touch my order.  Despite the cashier being friendly and assisting with my order (kimchi beef fries that were delicious), I'm likely not to return. A resturant with a high turnover rate really needs to maintain its standards. I'm still contemplating reporting to public health for lack of cleanliness. It's unacceptable."}
{"text":"All I have to say is \"Kimchi Fries.\" Gat damn. For $6 it's quite the portion. I think they've increased their prices a little bit since they renovated. But a Queen St. address is not a cheap one.   That said, the chicken taco was still great but not as great as I remember it being.   Banh Mi is the perfect quick fix and with the updated space, very welcoming and inviting for a small place. I thought there was going to be a line up out the door but it wasn't the case at all. We had to wait a little bit and eat at a counter (no different than if you were at a food truck event) but eventually managed to snag a seat.   I'm glad these guys are doing so well. They work hard and you can tell. Plus, I can't say no to coca cola in the glass bottle. It goes well with the pops of bright red accents in their space.  Excited to see where the second location will be!"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys really know their Banh Mi biz. I love their duck confit sandwiches ($7.50) and their other sandwiches are yummy too! Parking can be tricky around this area since there are a lot of other restaurants and businesses around the area. One time, I came in when they just opened and service was a bit slow, we waited a good 10-15 minutes for our food but if you come later in the day, service will be a bit faster. Also an order of sandwich can be enough for two meals since it is filling and the portion size is pretty generous! Their sweet potato fries are bomb and try out their baos, too if you have a chance!"}
{"text":"Duck. Confit. Banh. Mi.  DELICIOUS.  It tasted much better than I thought it would. Everything in the banh mi worked so well together and the bread was good.  We tried the kimchi fries and it was good, but Chilantro (in Austin/Houston, TX) is number one in our book.   We went during lunch rush, so the seats filled up quick. Get a friend to save a seat!   They have a really good system going and the wait wasn't too long.  Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"Papaya salad is bad. Everything else is good. Don't give them a fake name, they will not be amused."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Fries usually oversalty. But who pays $6.50 and up for a bahn mi?  Much better options just a few doors down from this location."}
{"text":"Hubby had me traumatized with these Vietnamese sandwiches in our younger years as he used to enforce his fave eats on my very picky self. His mom used to buy it from T&T and the bread rock hard had more veggies than meat. The herby taste of the  leafy greens is a bit overpowering for my enjoyment. Same herbs that is served at their pho establishments.  That may have placed a dark cloud on this very popular craze that dominated downtown and shamed other sandwich making places. They don't ask you for your toppings tho, except for level of spice and call it a day. So definitely much simpler than deciding between banana peppers or jalapeño. The 5 spice pork was tender and delish and found the pickled carrots and radish living up to Vietnamese eats.   Service was fast, although I'm sure it would've been faster if it hadn't been for the flirtatious looks and caresses the two employees gave one another as we all watched (struggled, actually)over the ridiculously high counter, so the production of my food was incognito anyways.  Kimchi fries was weirdly good, which would be odd for non kimchi lovers out there."}
{"text":"So I've been really wanting to try this place out after hearing so much about it from various people. The menu is simple, but there is still a lot to choose from. We decided to order braised beef and grilled chicken bahn mi sandwiches, along with the Kimchi fries.   The sandwiches looked great, but unfortunately didn't live up to my expectations which may have been a tad too high. The braised beef was completely bland and overall dry. I finished my half of the sandwich, but I added some of my Kimchi fries to get some flavour. I had one bite of the chicken and got a really big piece of fat or cartilage, but at least it was smothered in some sort of sauce. For this part of the meal, I was quite disappointed.  However! Their kimchi fries are AMAZING! As I mentioned, I used them to add flavour to my sandwich. I would definitely only come back for some of those. At first bite you get a huge punch of flavours and it makes you finish it all the way to the last tiny overfried fry.   I also liked that they had the old school cherry coke and vanilla coke as drink options! So overall, the sandwiches aren't much to rave about, but the fries were epic. I would probably try something else on the menu if I ever go back there again."}
{"text":"A must try. Get the Kalbi sandwich and kimchi fries. Wait and line can be long at peak times though."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys would be a great name for a boy band crooning viet-pop. For now, I am happy that they sell sandwiches.  I wanted to love the food but I only mostly like their stuff.  The first time I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, extra spicy with all the fiery spicy garnish. I've met my match: RED THAI CHILLIES, I bow to thee and vow never to eat thee henceforth.  But my quibble is with the luck sauce. I found it revoltingly sweet and felt that it destroyed the smoky flavor of the pulled pork. Plus the extra spicy hammer axe on my tongue every nanosecond or so, didn't put me in a great mood either.  On my next visit, I ordered the kimchi fries. When I first hear of this concoction I envisaged kimchi tempura in my head!  J'adore Kimchi Fries! I will happily sponsor any business that want's to print shirts with this logo. It's basically Vietnamese Poutine with fries, mayo, green onions, delicious pork, mayo and kimchi. Really enjoyed the sweet and sour flavor of this hearty meal.  On my third visit today, I ordered the five-spice pork belly sandwich, with jalapenos and hot sauce ( aka Sri Racha). I quite enjoyed biting into the soft meat which I think could've been better flavored since the lovely yellow raddish and the bread seemed to have a more potent taste. However, my mouth sorta ached towards the end of my meal. Perhaps the bun was bit hard?  The tables are tightly packed together which means you can easily partake of other people's conversations without much effort. I am egregious like that: today I heard about a young medical student's woes of living at home and a teacher's fond remembrance of a former student!  My gastric system gives this place a 3.5 while my cardiac system gives it a 4."}
{"text":"to be honest, it's hard for me to pay $6 for a bánh mì.  it's not unlike a $3 donut.  it's not that $3 is a lot of money; it's just that donuts aren't really suppose to be $3.  prejudices aside, however, it's really good value and a decent sandwich."}
{"text":"Kimchi fries are the best here!! I've tried them at other places but it just never tastes as good as BMB's. I love all the food on their menu! For a quick cheap lunch this place is the best! Seats are limited though so it's best for take out."}
{"text":"My god it has been a long time since I've been this satisfied with each bite I take!! This place lives up to the hype!  I decided to go here because it seemed like every second BlogTO post would talk about banh mi and particularly Banh Mi Boys. I've never tried Banh Mi and I was excited to have a fun meal in Toronto that I could actually afford (I'm back to poor student status).   This place delivered. It's a small place, so it can be hard to get seating, but it's perfect for grabbing a sandwich to go. I went with the traditional pork banh mi and had it at medium spice. God it is such a fantastic combination of creamy spice, bbq'ed meat with a dash of pickled veggies. The bread is also delightful and for only about 6-7$ you're coming away feeling full and satisfied.  Furthermore the service was quite friendly and fairly efficient. It's not as quick as typical fast food restaurants, but it's a hell of a lot better.  I can't wait to go back to this amazing spot!"}
{"text":"Our favourites are: - Pork belly banh mi  - Grilled chicken taco (LOVE!!!) - Fried chicken Bao Their signature sauce (regardless of the spice level) takes the flavour a notch higher. The fresh veggies and the portion of meat make it a hearty filling meal in itself. Great staff and an absolute value for money!"}
{"text":"Iv ordered everything from the menu, havnt been let down yet. They've  been consistent  since day one even before the long reno. Friendly ,fast, and affordable.  I love the tofu steam bao, only if I could get it with a slab of pork belly."}
{"text":"I came here at lunchtime to get an order of Kimchee Fries. There was the usual line of about 3 people and then a longer line of people waiting for food.   First of all, the girl who works at the counter, the one with all the piercings and the permanent scowl on her face, she needs an attitude adjustment. I have never seen her smile, she's always miserable, and while she's efficient at her job, a smile wouldn't kill you when you're the front line presence at an establishment. She also needs to speak up - I don't know if its the ambient noise around her or just that she's quiet, but you can't hear a word she says and she always has to repeat herself.  Second of all, there were more people behind the counter today than I've ever seen before and yet they were slower and less efficient than I've ever seen them. It took 20 minutes of waiting for me to get my Kimchee fries - I almost had to step forward and ask where the hell they were as people WAY back in line were getting their orders way before me (I was honestly wondering if they'd lost or forgotten my order). Most of the time they called names, but some of the time they wrote them on the bag and left them on the counter for unsuspecting patrons to figure out that it was theirs.   Third, the prices have gone up and the portion size (at least on the Kimchee Fries) has gone WAY down. This used to be a dish I couldn't finish on my own cause it was so big - now its more appropriately sized but for a higher price.  Fourth, this is probably the WORST Kimchee fries I've eaten from there. The whole thing is just a salt-fest (gross) and the kimchee tastes wrong. Usually these fries perk my tastebuds up and I can't get enough but today, I'm about to eat the second half by picking all the meat off and just having the fries because its too salty.  VERY disappointing. I'll think twice before I come back here and order the Kimchee fries again."}
{"text":"Before I stumbled upon the Bang Mi Boys near Yonge and College, I would beg my friends to make the trek down to Queen and Spadina for their glorious Panko Tofu Bao. The one thing that always irritated me was the lack of tables and space. However, the Yonge and College location isn't as busy, but still offers up the same, delicious deep fried tofu pockets of glory for the same incredibly low price. I've tried the kimchi fries (the vegetarian one) once, and was a huge fan, but keep going back for my lil' bao friend."}
{"text":"5* for their delicious 5 spice pork belly banh mi!!! also for their great selection of sodas and friendly service :D"}
{"text":"I ordered pork belly steam bao and got braised beef bao. It was still delicious but got jipped cuz PB is more $$ than beef. 3 stars for getting my order wrong but still tasty."}
{"text":"Big line up but moves pretty fast! Worth the wait though.  Love the BAO!!!  I ordered 3 things so I can try each one of my preferences on the menu.  1st item I had was the Beef Cheeks Bao (braised beef), a bit chewy and shouldn't be chewy if its cooked long enough.  I would give it a 3 out of 5 for this one because it still tasted pretty good and the ingredients in the Bao were delicious as well.  I LOVED the Fried Chicken Bao.  Definitely my favourite. YUM!!!!  I had it spicy and it wasn't spicy enough so next time I would order the very spicy Fried Chicken. 5 out of 5 for sure!  3rd item I tried was the Kalbi Beef Taco.  Different style of taco but very nice tasting.  The beef itself was a bit chewy as well so not a big fan.  The kimchi and cabbage, etc. in the taco were good though.  Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck in the city. I'm completely addicted to the Pork Belly Banh Mi, while the Club Bao (pork belly and fried chicken) is an epic hangover cure."}
{"text":"Just went there for the first time. I got the braised beef banh mi sandwich and it was delicious. I'm going back tomorrow for lunch! The service was quick even though there was a fairly long line. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is INSANE!  So delicious and a great twist on authentic Vietnamese sandwiches..  I ordered the pork belly bahn me, one of the buns, and some sweet potato fries and I was full for HOURS.  The pork belly was absolutely phenomenal and melted in my mouth.  The bread was fresh and not overly crunchy/crumbly like some other bahn mi's I have had so it was enjoyable to eat and not a total pain.  The ingredients were very fresh and I highly suggest adding the mayo sauce on your sandwich if you are into that sort of thing.  The service was friendly and mostly efficient.  I went around dinner time and the wait was not excessively long, and I was able to find a spot to sit at as well, which is always a plus.  Also, I really loved the sweet potato fries.  they were perfectly crisp and not soggy in the center, which is occasional a hard task to complete.  I am obsessed, and adding this to my Toronto-musts for when I cross the boarder."}

{"text":"Yum!!!! The pork belly melts in your mouth and is perfectly complemented by the crunch of carrot and a little spice. Always busy but fast and so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a friend. I was totally impressed on all fronts. Customer service was excellent with a good recommendation from staff. I had the chicken and really enjoyed it. Will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious!   I got the grilled pork bahn mi, pork belly bahn mi, and kimchi fries. They were all great but the bahn mis were particularly good for the price. ~$5 for a large sub.   The bahn mi keeps pretty well too. I ate one of them almost a day later and it still tasted pretty good."}
{"text":"Loved the 5 Spice Pork Belly Bao sandwiches at Banh Mi Boys so much the first time I had to go back for more...only that's not what I got.  I ordered two of the Bao sandwiches but ended up getting the pork Banh Mi sandwiches instead.  When I pointed it out to the cashier she very abruptly told me that's not what I ordered and walked away without so much as an apology or an offer to get me what I actually wanted.  I wasn't in the mood to argue the point and the Banh Mi sandwiches were actually pretty good, so I was satisfied. Funny enough I had read a couple of reviews on Yelp about this nasty cashier before I came to this location the first time and I thought people may have been exaggerating...they weren't!! I will be back for the food...but I'm going to make her repeat my order back to me before I pay!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch/mid-afternoon snack spot!  Meal comes in under $10 with one bahn mi (sandwich) and the kimchi fried to share. The spicy pork and the kalbi are the best. The place is always packed in the evenings or during prime lunch hours (1pm) but turnover is quick so finding a seat usually does not take long. Waiting for your food to be made may take a while during peak times!"}
{"text":"great pork belly sandwich, a bit of a wait during lunch and i'ts really cramped."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it.  Went on the basis of Yelp Reviews and was thoroughly impressed.  Had the short rib banh mi and a fried chicken steamed bao.  The sandwiches were crunchy/steamed, veggies deliciously pickled and/or fresh and the meat well seasoned.  Also very inexpensive.  Didn't bother trying the fries but the sandwiches were good enough that I made an extra trip there prior to flying out to take something on the plane"}
{"text":"Love this place, and love that they have a location at Gerrard and Yonge. I love getting the bao. There is something about the fluffy white bread that I just love. I have tried everything on their menu except their sides and salads. I have noticed that people really like the kimchi fries. Every time I am dining in someone orders the fries. You gotta try the pork belly and pulled pork. If you are looking to dine for under $5, Bahn Mi Boys is the place for you. Several meat options or go with tofu, crispy vegetables, and fluffy bao. Or go get the taco. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Delicious buns! Club and Pork Belly are the best!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a mid-afternoon snack, and were totally satisfied.  We ordered the pulled pork and the beef cheek buns as well as the papaya-jicama salad.  I have never previously had bahn mi in buns.  So good!  Not sure I can go back to baguettes.  The buns are soft and light, and allow you really taste the fillings.  The pulled pork was sweet and smoky.  The beef cheek was tender, but didn't have as much flavor.  I would go back repeatedly just for the papaya jicama salad.  Fresh and light with so much flavor!  I'm a really big fan of Thai style green papaya salads, so it's not a shock that I loved this, but it was really distinct from the Thai salad.  The jicama gave it a light crunchiness and the dressing was a good sweet/salty balance.  The mint leaves gave it the perfect punch of flavor!"}
{"text":"Man. I love this place. As a Vietnamese person and a big eater of traditional Vietnamese subs, I'm pretty impressed with BMB's spin on things. I typically don't enjoy taking an authentic dish and jazzing it up with \"gourmet\" and trendy ingredients like duck confit and pulled pork, but it really does work for these awesome sandwiches.  I've tried nearly everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. My favourite go-to is the kalbi beef taco and a jicama papaya salad. Perfect flavours, yummy dressings, totally and utterly satisfying. I've been to both locations (Queen st. and Yonge st.) and have been impressed by their speed and accuracy. Even during peak hours, they manage to get through the queue in a good amount of time. My only criticism would be of their decor and physical store. Both locations are quite small and do not accommodate the constant demand of hungry diners, and decor falls a little flat - not ugly but not super pleasing. And if I really wanna get picky, their garbage/recycling/compost bins have weird shapes and it's hard to fit your styrofoam salad boxes into the correct section.  But seriously. Don't even care about that stuff because the food is totally wonderful. You're missing out on great pleasure if you haven't had a sandwich, taco, steamed bao, or kimchi fries from BMB."}
{"text":"The hippest Banh Mi place I've ever been to. I mean that as a compliment...  I got the Five Spice Pork Belly Banh Mi- $5.99 and large and in charge.  I seriously can't stop thinking about their squid taco- $3.99. Delicious. I am salivating about my return.   They ask for how spicy you want it and next time I'm getting a 10. 7 just wasn't enough."}
{"text":"I love bao , haven't had it in a long time and I haven't been to this location before so I was pretty excited to go.   Price Range (Not including tax): $4-$7 per item.   Food Quality (Taste, Serving Size, Menu) - 3.5/5 I'll admit I think I overhyped myself for this which is probably why it didn't meet my expectations. I got the Pork Belly Bao and the Fried Chicken Bao. I thought the food was good, It just didn't blow my mind. I usually love pork belly, so I was a bit disappointed by this one. I didn't think it had a lot of flavour, a spicer sauce would have helped. The fried chicken was pretty good, pretty crispy, I should have ordered a spicier sauce for this one as well. The quality of the bao was amazing, really soft.  The vegetables were fresh. Just as you expect with bao, they aren't overly big. The meat to bao ratio was pretty good. I had 3 since I was pretty hungry and it filled me up quite well.   Atmosphere - 3/5 It had a burger place look which I thought was good. They have some seating, since it is more of a quick meal. If you're going with a large group like 5+, It might be hard if it's busy time. Parking is a bit tough since they don't have their own lot. I'd recommend parking on a side street near by as some of them are free.   Serivce - N/A You pay at the counter and picked up the food yourself so there really isn't much service involved. That being said, the cashier was nice and courteous. Wait times for food can vary, we had to wait about 5-10 mins but there were a lot of orders in front of us. I could see it taking less when it's not busy. We went around prime dinner time.   Would I go there again? I do want to go there again to try the spicier options to see if it gives more flavour and to try the Kimchi Fries; I regret not getting them last time."}
{"text":"The pork belly banh mi has consistently been wonderful. It's super tender and flavourful, a must try if you are a fan of fatty goodness.   I also like the idea of the fusion, with pickled radish and the sorts, makes it refreshing. Though to be honest, if you are looking for authenticity, then even the banh mi from T&T is more legit.   The kimchi fries is alright, maybe just not my type of fries. It's a nice idea. The bao does it's job. I think overall it's a fun place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to do. I wanted to order three of the banh mis and kimchi fries but there would be so much wasted food. I finally decided on two (pulled pork and beef cheek) plus the kimchi fries, half of which could be saved for tomorrows lunch.  Even with the plan, eating half the fries and essentially one banh mi filled me up. They were so good, in the running for the best banh mis I've ever had. And the price is great.  I came at lunchtime and all the seats were full and there was a line-up of 10 people waiting for their food. I ordered and had my food in under 10 minutes, these people are efficient and pleasant.  I had a great experience here."}
{"text":"Came back again and this time tried a bunch of new things.  Squid taco -- you know when you eat something and you want that last bite to be that? Well this was the taco you should save for last. $3.99  Kalbi beef taco -- pretty darn good! I didn't expect the tacos to be so good. They use like a small roti and it is divine. $3.99  Grilled pork banh mi -- obviously amazing. $5.49  Kimchi fries -- I personally am not a fan of kimchi, but you can put them on the side if youre sharing (which we were). The pulled pork and all that other jazz on it was perfecto. $5.99  Pork belly steamed bao -- was surprisingly so soft! The bao I mean. Once again very good. $3.49  Fried chicken steamed bao -- if youre going to order bao, order this one. \"It's like a Jr. Mcchicken\" .... But way better!! $3.99  Grand total of $32 for a mouthwatering feast. I wish I could turn back time and re-eat it all."}
{"text":"Westernized banh mis, baos, fries and tacos. Great fast casual restaurant with a few tables for a quick bite.   There are several meat options including  - Five Spice Pork Belly - Grilled Chicken, Fried Chicken - Squid - Lemongrass Tofu - Duck Confit  - Braised Beef  I've tried several in the form of both bah mis and baos and they're all quite good. The Five Spicy Pork Belly is very flavourful and tasty. The grilled chicken tasted more traditional and is a safer option for anyone who is picky. You can't really go wrong with any of your choices.  They come heavily dressed with pickled vegetables (primarily sliced carrots) as well as cilantro. Make sure to ask for it without if you're not a fan!"}
{"text":"2 words of deliciousness:  Club Bao.  Fried chicken + 5 spice pork belly (plus toppings) on a pillowy soft bao...   This location being a 2 minute walk from home is so great!  Marshall's, Bed Bath and Beyond and now Bahn Mi Boys... Yonge and Gerrard is getting better by the day!  If you like more bread than meat go for a Bahn Mi Sandwich,  but if you are like me, and are all about the meat - he he - get a Bao!"}
{"text":"I've lived in cities with a real Little Saigon. These boyz bring back memories of that. From sandwiches to Korean poutine to bao, everything was that perfect balance of crunch, protein, sweet, and salt. It's a crowded place, but I can see why. I'd happily come back."}
{"text":"Ok, what the heck's a Bao we said??   Well after eating one of every type they had I can say a soft dough sandwich that is AWESOME!!!   Also had the grilled chicken taco which was delicious and the Kimchi fries which were the best I've ever had.  5 STARS!!"}
{"text":"This ain't no momma's banh mi! I really wanted to hate this place as I was used to getting banh mi from their parents sandwich place for less than a TTC Token. No joke though, their sandwiches are the real deal. I've tried them all, but my heart always chooses the pork belly sub. Tried the club bao the other day though.... Wow. Generous slabs of belly, a fried chicken thigh, between a pillowy white bao and all the fixings? Kill.Me.Now."}
{"text":"Give me all the kimchi fries.   I love them! So cheap and extremely cheerful.   Their menu is short and simple. I'd recommend the fried chicken baos, also very good!!"}
{"text":"I didn't actually eat here personally, but I bought two sandwiches for my sister I was visiting at Mount Sinai. Based on the good reviews I came here, since she loves her subs. we all know hospital food inst nearly as satisfying lol My sister is a chef and huge foodie, so if she loved this place then it must be great. I got her one pork and one chicken, hot peppers on the side and xxtra mayo/cilantro They are great here with special requests like that, no fuss or disappointment. My sister shared her sandwich with her little cousin, and he loved it. Which means great place for kids as well. Meat is seasoned very well she said and the bun was crispy on the outside the way she likes. But she loved the pork the most.  When I went in it was pretty packed, which is a good sign. This was on a Thursday evening. i like how you order first and then line up to receive your food. Keeps the line flowing well. I will def be back here for bite when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"I should have shared a sandwich and fries with my husband because the portion sizes are HUGE. I ordered the pork Banh Mi and the kimchi fries. I could eat those fries every day for the rest of my life and be really happy. They had pulled pork on them as well and they were outstanding. The sandwich itself had nice crisp bread and was packed with veggies and meat. This is a small location so plan on taking out your food or squeezing into a small spot to sit."}
{"text":"So good my friends and I ate here twice during our week long trip in Toronto from the states. We went to a lot of restaurants that week but this was probably our favorite. It is a little shop with not a lot of seating but the food was delicious, the pricing was cheap, and the wait was short.  I had the roast pork banh mi (twice), the duck confit ban mi, and the five spice pork belly steamed bao. All were phenomenal! The ingredients are fresh and the meats were perfectly cooked. My six friends got other things like the kimchi fries and said they were also fantastic. Two of my friends are Vietnamese (country of the banh mi) so their praise says a lot. Definitely check this place out whether you are a local or just visiting, especially if you don't want to spend a lot!"}
{"text":"delicious vietnamese subs that have been elevated beyond the \"mystery meat\" ones you get down the street in china town. You can't go wrong with the baos either.  Duck confit is topping of choice."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to's in the city for a sandwich without breaking the bank. The duck confit is always on point, actually, all of their sandwiches are on point.   The kimchi fries are a great veg option to boot!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I have been back about a half dozen times and I'm never disappointed.My favourite item is the grilled pork Bahn Mi. And it's well priced too. Where else can you get amazing food for about $5?  If you've never been there before, it's not a sit down restaurant. You can sit down and eat, they have tables but it's no a leisurely meal. Also, if you take the sandwiches out the crispy veggies get a bit soggy from the heat of the meat."}
{"text":"Delicious! The Banh Mi here is very tasty and the Kim Chi fries are to die for. Great hole in the wall joint in Toronto. The bread for the Banh Mi was perfect, a lot of places the bread is so tough that it cuts up your gums, not here, very perfectly made!"}
{"text":"The cashier with a cheek piercing is inexcusably rude and drags down the otherwise reliable quality of banh mi boys. I ordered a steamed bao as I usually do and this time whoever assembled it over stuffed it with veggies and drenched it in sauce. Making it difficult to eat, sauce squirting out onto the table and all over my hands. When I brought this to her attention her comments were a dismissive \"what do you want me to do about it?\" and extremely confrontational.   I can live without this food, you just lost a customer because of the poor etiquette of your staff."}
{"text":"I just love it. The steamed Bao, the Banh Mi, the Kimchi Fries - it's all delicious ! Don't go at noon if you hate line ups!"}
{"text":"If they ever banned me - sorry, bahned mi - from this place, I would probably die.   Bahn Mi Boys is one of those joints that you just want to walk into, look at the menu and tell the order taker: \"yes.\" Seriously, I've never been disappointed with the food here, and have no problems waiting in line at rush hour to get my hands on such incredible grub.   Now, while everything is absolutely delicious, I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you my personal favourites, which have got to be the Pork Belly bahn mi and the Kimchi Fries. The sandwich is seasoned perfectly, and literally (figuratively) melts in your mouth. The kimchi fries are a meal in themselves... topped with pulled pork, spiced mayo, green onion and kimchi, they're the only fries where I've ever been happy that ketchup wasn't an option.   So if you're looking for a place to go at or around Queen and Spadina, tell anyone else who gives you a recommendation to shove it, and come over to Bahn Mi Boys. Chances are I'll see you there."}
{"text":"Was wondering around with a friend and ended up here. He said he liked the place so we went it. It was rather busy for 1:30pm. Not sure what to order the cashier suggested a few items. The special fries and sandwich. Wish I could remember the names but they were very good.   I've grown to like korean food and this really does it justice. It is a nice Asian Mexican fusion that gives everything a nice unique twist. the tacos look nice so I'll have to try them next time. The fries were very good, a tad too much mayo for me but I know many others that would love that quantity. The sandwich was great once I took the cilantro off (which I don't like).   I guess I would have liked it more if I knew what I was getting into but I was still very pleasantly surprised with what was just around the corner."}
{"text":"Yum. Fast and inexpensive - really great flavors and textures, too."}
{"text":"Definitly the best banh mi i ever had, and the kimchi fries were so different and delicious"}
{"text":"Let's taco-bout how good the food is here:  I feel like it's super unreasonable for people to judge this place based on the \"authenticity\" of its banh mis. Yes, yes, it's not traditional liver, the cucumbers are not cut in the correct Vietnamese way and they didn't make the bread from the grains of whateverwhatever. But the assumption is that if you're coming to a place that serves pulled pork tacos and kimchi fries, it's going to be a westernized version of traditional Vietnamese cuisine.  I have eaten here more times than I'd like to admit, because I love the bread (and how it doesn't cut open the roof of your mouth), the picked veggies and the roasted pork belly. There are a variety of meats to choose from, and a tofu option for the herbivores that is just as good. The tacos are served on an Asian-inspired crepe-pancake thing that is making me want to eat it as I am typing this. Typically, Asian-fusion is confusing and messy but Banh Mi Boys makes it work with the right spices (including the choose-your-own-spiciness adventure) and the delicious combination of kimchi on everything.  Minus one star for the kimchi fries though, because the past three times I've visited my fries were limp and soggy (and no one likes anything limp... pun not intended).  Skip the fries and order an extra taco, or two extra tacos, or four, or ten."}
{"text":"My favourite new sandwich shop in down town Toronto. I had the fried chicken steamed bao and the kimchi fries. My bill came up to just under $10.00 and it was one of the most flavourful lunches I have had in a very long time. The kimchi fries made me forget about poutine, and my only negative comment is that I wish the steamed bao sandwiches were a little larger. Maybe next time I will try one of their larger sandwiches, this is definitely a better alternative than Quiznos or Subway!"}
{"text":"Visiting the Banh Mi Boys was quite a treat for me when I visited Toronto. I am from a small Vietnamese community in Southern California, and I have a higher standard when it comes to Vietnamese sandwiches, especially being Vietnamese myself.  Inside: Order at the front, and there are a few booths for dining in. The interior is modern and up-to-date, and it seems like a good place to grab a quick lunch.  Service: Quick service, polite staff, but don't assume they speak Vietnamese like I did, hahaha.  Food: -Pork Belly Banh Mi. Great take on the Vietnamese sandwich. It's filling, and you get a good mix for flavors with the cilantro and pickled daikon and carrots. -Pork Belly Steamed Bao. Maybe an overkill on the pork belly with the banh mi, but it's still good. -Kim Chi Fries. This is a huge serving! Great, but I couldn't finish it after everything that I ordered."}
{"text":"I tried pork belly sandwich, pork belly bao and beef bao.  I preferred the basis over the sandwich, mainly because I really liked the bao itself, nice and soft with a hint of sweetness. They put the same pickle veggies in both sandwich and bao. Beef was good, pork belly was not what I expected. The texture of the pork belly is a bit like ham. I was hoping it would be soft and melt in my mouth."}
{"text":"Amazed that I haven't been here until today. I love that it's a casual setting with simple yet amazing food. My wife and I shared  the pulled pork bao, 5 spice porkbelly sandwich and the khimchi Fries with pulled pork.  The quantity was great was the price and I do recommend this place to anyone looking to have some tasty food."}
{"text":"Why have I not tried this sooner? Was in the area and I discovered that Banh Mi Boys is amazing.   First off the store ambiance is great. Seating, cleanliness and a view of the food preparation area. When I went it wasn't too crowded (11:30ish) but I believe lines form around 12:30 until 2. Nonetheless, they seem fast and efficient.   The menu is awesome and great pricing! I love how the menu has vegetarian options in each area too, that's a major plus for me. Decided on tofu fries and a Panko crusted tofu bao.   my order was ready very swiftly. The tofu fries were delicious...basically kimchi fries but instead of pulled pork they substitute with tofu. This is incredibly filling...I was not able to finish the entire box.   The tofu bao was delicious too!! Lightly fried Panko crusted tofu with Sriracha and fresh veggies....mmmm so good!!   And the prices are so reasonable! I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Went here, Ordered food and drinks and very nicely I asked to use the washroom and was told no.... This is hilarious considering the place was empty and it's 2pm on a Sunday. This place and might as well have been a wasteland, If I had peed on the tables I don't think the staff or anyone would have noticed.  -Environment was filthy -Staff was beyond rude -Food was tasteless and dry -Drinks were cold and that's about the only thing this place had going for it. I will never return to this establishment, I will tell all my friends and family to never visit this place. So disgusted and heart broken by this tourist trap void that has the audacity to label itself a restaurant."}
{"text":"Canada does Asian Fusion so well! A hip spot run by cool cats. Tasty Kalbi Beef Banh mi sandwich! Great bread and tasty pickled vegetables. The Kim Chi was a bit sloppy but I liked how spicy it was. I recommend it."}
{"text":"came in the evenings. Tried kimchi fries, it was delicious. It was overly salty though, because 1hr later i had the need to purchase a bottle of water because i felt like i was pickling on the inside. Otherwise the food came fast and good. a little expensive for fries though."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options. Had veggie Kimchi fries, lemon grass tofu bun and five spice pork belly steam bao. Good for two people. Under 20 with drink.  Not too many seats but people move a long quite fast. Quick service and good food. Give it a try !   (sketch hood though)"}
{"text":"Grabbed a grilled chicken sandwich for lunch from Banh Mi Boys today.  I have to say, I was a fan.  Normally, I pass these sammys up because I find the buns dry and tasteless.  Not here!  The bread was actually yummy.  The toppings were all good - nice and fresh tasting and there was plentiful chicken.  And I thought the price for the quality and quantity of the sandwich and the location of the shop was totally justifiable.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Okay for real, the best thing is the kimchi fries.  I ordered the grilled chicken banh mi and thought it was meh.  I had it previously at the Queen W. location when the joint first opened and I remembered liking it a lot more then as opposed to now.  Today I switched it up a bit and opted for the beef cheek bao and liked it a bit more, but still wasn't loving it.  Really, the bomb is the fries.  Holy salty flavourful mess of goodness!!!  Why did I hold out to my third visit to indulge???"}
{"text":"On my trip back home to TO, I made a list of high-end restaurant to visit and quick/cheap bites. I'm glad Banh Mi Boys was on the list. Wow. Quick and friendly service to begin with. The sandwich, top 3 sandwich I have ever had in my life, and I consider myself a sandwich connoisseur. Fresh, crunchy veggies and the tastiest pork. Under $10. and HUGE. My only regret is not trying to steamed buns (which everyone else was eating. But do yourselves a favor, eat here!"}
{"text":"There's a reason this is the second most rated restaurant in Toronto!  I ordered based on what Yelp told me to - pork belly banh mi and kimchi fries. Thank you Yelpers, they didn't disappoint!  Food: 5 stars. I ended up coming back a second time, and got the grilled pork banh mi as well. Between the three, NOT a single complaint. Perfectly flavored, perfectly portioned, perfectly happy eating.  Service: 4.5 stars. Banh Mi Boys is b-u-s-y. Their food is yummy so that is the reason they are so popular. The restaurant is tight so there are constantly line congestion and few empty tables. The workers do a great job at getting food out quickly and neatly. But I never saw any workers smile! At the register, they are quick and you feel rushed; like they can't get to the next person fast enough. And they don't pick up their phone (called to see if they take credit cards - they do). If they made their customers feel valued and welcomed, service would be 5.5 stars."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, good seating and amazing food. HIGHLY recommend the kimchi fries or any of their pork options. Beef is a little dry here."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is a great lunch option if you are downtown. The banh mi and baos are delicious and there are a lot of choices. I personally love their braised beef! The kim chi fries are also really good, but much larger than you would expect.  Overall, good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The place is a little small, so finding a seat during lunch hour is difficult.  You have to try their twist on Poutine!  The pork belly sandwich and Kimchi Fries are my favorite. SOOOOO good."}
{"text":"It was an amazing sandwich. It was so good I forgot to take a picture of it. I got a spicy pork bahn mi and it was quite generously loaded. Definitely worth the $5"}
{"text":"Food is fast & furious.  Not pricey considering it's fusion, but their $5+ bahn mi's def are not as cheap as ones you find down ctown.  We had kalbi, calamari bahn mi's, duck confit salad & kimchee fries.  No regrets, everything was very tasty.  We went during lunch rush, so there were many ppl.  But service was fast & furious.  Don't expect to sit comfortably! Not many tables/seats."}
{"text":"I work a few blocks away and I love Vietnamese food, so you'd think a trip to Banh Mi Boys would be a no-brainer. Strangely, it only happened recently, and as the result of a Yelp coin flip at that.   Not that I hadn't thought of BMB before, but I hang out with a pretty conservative office crowd, eager to try the latest pizza parlour or burger joint, but shy when it comes to more adventurous eats...and to be perfectly honest, if i had the choice of a sandwich or a bowl of noodles in soup, or curry, or something else that is scalding hot and brought to my table by a disinterested waiter, you have an idea where my vote will go.   Still, BMB has attracted raves from professional and amateur food critics alike, and in the wake of David Chang, Danny Bowien and other new \"Don't call me\" Asian Fusionists, I was excited to finally pay BMB a visit.   Maybe it was the anticipation, or my love of of classic banh mi and pho and other Vietnamese deliciousness, but I couldn't help but feel like I should be enjoying my lunch more.   Maybe it was the context; I felt rushed through my meal (never a good thing).   Maybe it was the seating (weirdly in line with the whooshing cold of the front door, and adjacent to other patrons smacking their trays against the garbage can),   Maybe it was the service; I placed my order, and was shunted to the back of the room to wait while my order was prepared. I usually lunch at slightly off-hours to maximize my time spent enjoying my lunch instead of waiting for it. At BMB I chewed up most of the appointed hour waiting for my meatball sandwich and kimchee fries, which led to the aforementioned rush.  Maybe it was the food itself. From the name, I expected more of a Viet-twist to my lunch, which I associate with layered, savoury flavours. My meatball sandwich was good, but the balance of flavors tipped precipitously towards sweetness, as did the Kim chi fries; within a few bites, it all started to taste the same-the sandwich sogged through and the fries went limp, and I went into a hoisin-inflected coma. Not that I'd expect it, but I would have appreciated a bit of guidance from the staff--pairing the fries with something crisper or spicier might have helped.   I enjoyed BMB enough to go back, though I would order differently and visit on a day unencumbered by deadlines.   And I'm not so sure I'd believe the hype."}
{"text":"Had a 90 minute wait for Grand Electric restaurant and decided to go to Bahn Mi Boys for the first time for an apetizer. Got the five spice pork belly steamed bao. Wow. I could eat ten more of these things! Delicious, fresh tasting, great sauces. Service was exceptional: fast paced, and very keen on making sure your order was right. Can't wait to return for the kimchi fries! Would eat here any day."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend so thought I would give it a go since we needed something quick.  We ordered the Grilled Pork Bhan Mi, Five Spices Pork Belly Bao and the Kimchi Fries.  Sub was quite good, with decent toppings, and the pork was also very tasty. Wasn't an out of this world sub, there were plenty of places in Vancouver (Tung Hing) that are better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Not authentic vietnamese banh mi but still the best fusion version i've had, good size and generous fillings. Friendly staff and speedy service too. Have tried a few of the diffferent banh mis and the kimchi fries. Diagnosis : DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb dot come! I've been hearing about Banh mi boys for a while but I live in the burbs so I never had a chance to visit. I noticed it was in the area when I was downtown last night and I HAD to go.   When I first walked it I was like this place smells amazing and just has an incredible vibe. It's packed so you know the food must be good and everyone is smiling as they stuff their faces. Plus I got like three smiles from the staff behind the counters.   I ordered the kimchi fries with beef cheek, grilled chicken taco and kalbi beef bahn mi. In my head I kept singing *this ishhhh is bananas b-a-n-a-n-a-s! And dancing from side to side with every bite. Excuse me because I jumped on the bahn mi train late nth it's just a different flavour profile in a sanwhich for me and I loved it! I'm not going to lie I've never really been a huge kimchi fan so I would probably ask for less kimchi on my fries because it is a generous portion but I still like it. The beef cheek is so tender and flavourful and they too your fries with mayo too (I love mayo and fries!) I was just fantastic. Sometimes I wish I loved downtown they get all the cool stuff! Wahhhh!"}
{"text":"Five Spice Pork Belly Banh Mi was delicious and Kimchi Fries portion is huge."}
{"text":"Fast, tasty, affordable Vietnamese sandwiches - the weekday lunch lines are long for a reason but service runs like clockwork. My favourite is the Grilled Pork ($5.50), which is also the cheapest one! Packed with ingredients, the pork is tender and savoury while the veggies give it a refreshing kick. The baguettes are crispy but soft on the inside and there's just the right amount of sauce. This is probably the lightest sandwich on the menu but it is still quite filling.   Would recommend takeout over dining in - it's a pretty stuffy, narrow space exacerbated but the queue of customers. The staff are pretty busy so the tables aren't cleared as often either. Overall though, it's one of the best value lunch options in the area!"}
{"text":"Ugh this place is fantastic.  Perfect for a quick lunch or snack during the day.  I got the 5 spice pork banh mi as well as the kimchi fries. I'm not a big fan of poutine, but this kimchi version poutine makes it better to my taste. The banh mi is absolutely wonderful. The veggies are fresh, pork is tender, chewy and flavorful. I wish there is a place like this in my hometown."}
{"text":"I always get the pork belly bao and kimchi fries when I come here. There is always a long line up and very limited seating. But the food is great for a decent price. Pork belly bao is my favourite, over the banh mi. I find the banh mi too dry for my liking. The kalbi taco was also good and flavourful but I prefer the texture of the bao."}
{"text":"My go-to place for study food. I regularly order the fried chicken steamed bao and the pork belly bahn mi. Their fried chicken bao is my personal replacement to the McD Junior Chicken; super juicy, and the subtle sweetness of the bao complements the juicy fried chicken well. The kim chi poutine is great side too if you're extra hungry. If you don't like cilantro, you may have to remind them when they prepare it."}
{"text":"I prefer the bahn mi at Nguyen Huong Food and the kimchi poutine at Yakitori Bar. It seems like \"fusion\" is an excuse for such an excessive price tag on the limited menu. Out $12 for an order of kimchi fries and beef kalbi taco."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating. I'm not a huge fan of viet sandwiches so I don't have them often. Last time I had Banh Mi Boys was at the downtown location, probably 2 years ago.   Steamed Bao - Pulled Pork and 5 Spice Pork Belly (approx $3.50 each) Steamed buns stuff with meat, carrots, and a slice of cucumber and cilantro. The pulled pork was slightly dry and not saucy enough. As for the pork belly I couldn't taste the '5 spice', in fact there wasn't much flavor. The pork belly meat was surprisingly slightly tough, not as tender as I anticipated.  Duck Confit Banh Mi ($6) - This sandwich was large. The duck meat was tender and flavorful. The Kalbi Beef taco ($4) was actually my favorite. The taco skin wasn't your typical taco soft shell, but tasted more like a roti kinda style. The kabli was flavorful, with all the ingredients it was really tasty! Portions were quite large though, well worth the price. Generous in terms of ingredients which was unexpected."}
{"text":"Thinking about this place makes me so sad. They only have locations in Toronto and I am all the way in London, removed from the delicious food the big city can offer me. I went two different times, got the five spice pork, crispy tofu and kimchi fries. Everything was just perfect. The kimchi fries has a giant chunk of pork on it and it's a bit much for me. That wasn't a complaint though, no one should ever complain about too much delicious food. I got the bao and the banh mi, both of which were perfect. I would get the bao just because it's smaller and I can try more flavors. You can't really go wrong though"}
{"text":"This place has redefined the sandwich, and modernized the banh mi, plus poutine-inspired tofu fries with Kim chi.  Amazing!  While it didn't live up to the hype, which was very intense, its a good place to get a good bang mi with a twist."}
{"text":"This is my favorite cheap eats in Toronto! Strongly recommends the Pork Belly Bao and the kimchi fries. It's really delicious!"}
{"text":"Toronto has been blessed with more than its fair share of creative fusion establishments, but Banh Mi is one of the few that truly seems here to stay.  Much has been made of the kimchi pork poutine, and delicious \"tacos\" that seem to be a hodgepodge of Vietnamese, French, Mexican, and Korean cuisines! Whatever their formula is, it works, and it can be attributed at least to the freshness of the ingredients.   If I had to pick one item off the menu it would have to be the pork belly banh mi! The perfectly toasted crunchy bun, goes so well with the marinated pork belly stuffed in between fresh vegetables and Vietnamese mayo (not sure what it's actually called!)  Overall a fantastic place for quick, delicious, not so healthy fusion food. I wish this place was open at 4am!"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is one of the great cheap-eats in Toronto. They've also done a great job of creating Asian fusion cuisines, like the combinations of banh mi (Vietnamese sandwiches), bulgogi styles grilled beef, and Taiwanese styles steamed bun sandwich. You shall not miss this place out if you are a fan of Asian food :p I personally love their kimchi fries."}
{"text":"So it has been 3 years.  This all started from a girl I met in my class when I was in my sophomore year in UofT. We were definitely really close at the time - she often wanted me to hangout with her after classes & exams. So this one day she told me about the Kimchi Fries and asked me to come to Banh Mi Boys with her. It was definitely one of the coolest day of my life; not only the food was good, but I really thought she was cool. For some reason though, she stopped talking to me & hated me before she went back to her home (she's a west coast girl and she always smelled like bagels. God knows why). I remembered how she brought like 2 dudes she had relationships with when she said her farewell to me. It's not like I got intimidated by her & her dudes or anything, it's just that I still don't understand why she hated me so much until this day. Seriously, she deleted me on Facebook and everything since then & it puzzled me so much. I'm pretty sure I always treated her well & with ultimate respect and dignity. I did not deserve the hate God girl. I forgot your name, but you sure remained as one of the biggest mysteries of my life.   oh and good kimchi fries, although it tastes a bit salty because of the story I associated it with"}
{"text":"As several reviewers have already written, this place is much better than the Yonge str location.  Nicer waiters, faster service. Five spice pork in a bao is likely the best item here.  I would still avoid the bread as it looks as dense as at the Yonge location."}
{"text":"Really for students of nth generation who want to have pseudo-modern banh mis in a pseudo-modern disco fast food atmosphere, rather than the original simple but better ones from these vietnamese cheaper (dives) places like Nguyen Banh Mi on Spadina-Chinatown.  4 to 5 idling guys behind the counter who looked at me as soon as I entered as if they were to ask me for my student ID before I can even look at the menu board and order something. They did not try to help or guide me for the optimal choices. Just staring, brainlessly...  Poutine kimchi is one famous dish here... but honestly it seems that everyone agrees that the fries are awful and I clearly saw all customers eating, like me, the kimchi with pulled porked, but leaving asides all those fatty, oil soaked bland fries... Piece of advice to owners: spare some money and oil... just offer a kimchi-pulled pork... forget about these ugly fries...  Banh mi sandwich bread is not good, Not fluffy, too dense, not crunchy... simply not fresh... Meat is moist (and oily saucy), this could be OK.... but overall the sandwich does not taste like authentic and fresh enough... disappointing...   Conclusion: trendy and fashion... but overrated...."}
{"text":"I recently came back from Vietnam and was craving some delicious banh mi.  Damn son, turns out that the grilled pork banh mi was bigger, badder, and BETTER than anything I had in Vietnam. And for 5 bucks. WTF, serious feelings of bizarro world when eating here. Be warned."}
{"text":"I came here to try my first ever banh mi sandwich. I went with a safe choice and ordered the pork belly banh mi. It was absolutely delicious. It was also very big and filling. I want only able to finish about half of it for lunch and saved the rest for later. Such a good price and very friendly service. Excited to take my husband here!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended I tried the Fried Chicken Bao and the kimchi fries. I loved it. The place is small we were lucky to get a table for 5 people. Its a get in eat your food and leave type of plave which I love. Get your food and get out. I consider it a quick bit to eat. The prices were very reasonable, for such great flavor. Would definatly come again..."}
{"text":"Ever since their debut on \"You Gotta Eat Here\", I loved going to their joint for Steamed Bao and Banh Mi. That was years ago, when they set up shop at their first location on Queen and Spadina. Since then, they've opened multiple locations, and I just happened to stop by the one near Yonge and Eglinton for a late lunch.  I ordered their Five Spice Pork Belly steamed Bao with a side of fries, all in for just under $7.50.  Their flavours are just like I remembered: salty and savoury from the big slice of pork belly with their signature \"luck sauce\", and sweetness from the bao and pickled veg.  What sucks about today though was that I felt there was a bit too much pickled veg. It ended up shoving the pork belly from underneath so when I took a bite of the bottom, all I got was bao and veg. A bit of an imbalance, but I'm willing to look past it.  I dug into the fries after my first bite of the bao, and it was all soft... no crispiness. Now, my mentality is: you can't mess up a good fry. There's probably someone who likes soft fries, but I was just hoping for something with a little more crunch.  Despite that, I still love Banh Mi Boys and their food. It'll take a bit more than that to change my mind."}
{"text":"I went today (during the March Break) with 2 other friends and the first thing I noticed was that the place wasn't exactly clean. There were food scraps on the table and garbage on the floor around the disposal bins. Needless to say, it didn't leave a good first impression. We ordered kimchi fries, grilled chicken banh mi and a kalbi beef taco. I asked for no cilantro and no green onions on my food. There were about 5 people ahead of me when I ordered and I waited around 15 minutes before the food was served to me. When the server called my name, I noticed some cilantro sticking out of the banh mi and I asked if she had included cilantro - she did. I informed her that I had asked for no cilantro and then another server came and talked to her to redo the order. I got the food and after taking a few bites from the kalbi beef taco, realized that there were some remnants of cilantro in there. Instead of making the order again, they had just removed the cilantro. This was disappointing to me because they had a sign that specified they would customize our orders as long as we did it with the cashier - which I did - but they still made the order wrong and only picked out the cilantro.   Grilled Chicken Banh Mi - lots of pickled carrots and not a lot of chicken. It tasted alright, but the lack of protein did not make this item worth it.  Kalbi Beef Taco - the beef was a bit on the chewy side and it was about 4 bite sizes, but the other ingredients went well with the beef.  Kimchi Fries - absolutely delicious! pretty big portion so the sharing was a good idea. lots of kimchi and pulled pork and the fries were surprisingly not soggy.  All in all, the food was average (with the kimchi fries as an exception, which I adored!), the service wasn't great and the place didn't make you want to stay to eat for too long. An employee started digging through the trash with her hands while we were eating to sort the recyclables from the biodegradables, and while I agree that yes, she was just doing her job, it didn't make for an appetizing scenario."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Do your self a favor by going there before you complete reading this review. This place is totally worth the hype! We got the lemongrass tofu taco and steamed tofu buns! Get the extra side of the hot sauce and you are all set! The servers are friendly as well. The steamed buns certinaly make it to the list of last meal requests ;)"}
{"text":"I heard about Banh Mi Boys on the Buffalo Yelp talk board. Thank you. I'm still dreaming about the lemongrass tofu bahn mi. The prices are so inexpensive - it's almost unbelievable to get such good, fresh food in the middle of downtown Toronto. Yonge St., no less. I can't wait to go back and try the panko tofu steamed bao and the entire menu of fries. Order at the counter, grab a seat at one of the five or six tables or get your order to go."}
{"text":"I feel a bit bad about giving this small place a 3-star when everyone has given it mostly 5 and 4 stars, but I was kinda disappointed with the place.   First, it was hard to find the place. There were no big signs on the top and I wandered around Queen St. before I finally found the tiny un-renovated eatery. When we walked in, the narrow pathway and bare walls completely took me off guard. After moving in and out and around the pathway to let people through and being confused about where the line begins, I finally was able to place my order. Despite knowing its blatant limitations, the place still had no method to its madness and people behind the counter didn't have a properly assembly line to dictate who takes the order and who makes what part of a sandwich.   I ordered a spicy beef bahn mi and a kalbi taco and sat down in their dining area that resembled a restaurant from a taiwanese night market, or a barely furnished cafeteria.   The spicy beef bahn mi was neither spicy nor all that impressive. It tasted like 5-spice braised beef that hasn't been cooked long enough to get the full aroma in the food. My mom used to braise all kinds of beef and stuff them in sandwiches and this was reminiscent of that, but nowhere as good.  The kalbi taco was less of a disappointment and quite enjoyable. No complaints about that. I think next time I'm going to try to ask for that in a steamed bao.  Their toppings and condiments are up to par though. The pickled daikon and carrots were done right, and there was a delicious mayonnaise type of condiment that accompanied the bahn mi which allowed me to almost finish the bahn mi (left about a quarter).   I'll give this place another change after the renovation, and perhaps try other things on the menu and maybe I'll change my mind."}
{"text":"Delicious bao, great kimchi fries and a nice fresh menu! The only downside is the seating is limited but there are so many great things about this place! Relaxing, with chill music and you don't have to wait too long for your food, which is delicious and the servings are pretty decent and filling while being both delicious and fresh. I suggest either he fries chicken bao or spiced pork belly bao, and the kimchi pork fries are so damn good! 10/10 would go again l."}
{"text":"Cheap delicious eats. I always go spicy chicken.  Just jalapeno, as habenero extra hot is mouth numbing with less flavour.  One complaint of staff read this is - please get out and wipe the tables more often.  And yet still five stars.  Cuz it's a dann good under$10 sandwich."}
{"text":"My go to place- good food, cheap, friendly staff and consistent. My favorite and go to are  the panko tofu steamed Bao, and jicama papaya salad, both are so good. The braised beef steamed bao is also delicious and juicy. I wouldn't recommend the tacos or the calamari banh mi, but the grilled pork banh mi is another great option."}
{"text":"My favourite is the pork belly bao :)  It was really tasty!  The pork belly was marinated just right and it tasted really good with the soft steam bao.  I need to eat two or more to fill me up.  Price wise it's not that cheap if you need to eat two or more, but it's not something I can find easily in Toronto so it's ok.  I also had the banh mi (pork belly again? I forgot)....it was so so.  Compare to the $3 banh mi from other local vietnamese sub places, I think it's a bit overpriced.  The banh mi bun was so crispy that it cuts my mouth....  I would return for the steam bao only!"}
{"text":"Good and really tasty Banh mi. I heard about the restaurant back from Montreal. As a Vietnamese, I have to check it out. It locates in Chinatown. I brought a grilled pork sandwich to go. After a long day in my bag, the sandwich taste amazing. The bread is soft and moist. The meat cook to perfection. The topping is authentic (they even have cucumber, most of Vietnamese sandwich in Montreal don't).  The restaurant is a fusion. They serve Vietnamese sandwiches with Canadian side dishes, poutine and fries. A nice combination. I like it . Definitely, I gonna return."}
{"text":"Really exited about this place as I love Banh Mi, I regularly go to Banh Mi Ba Le on Dundas at Spadina and also Nguyen Huong a little north of Spadina and Dundas.  Decided to try out the pork belly and fried chicken bao as I have never tried anything like it before.   A little underwhelming. It was okay, but a little bland. A lot of shredded carrots and not enough meat, though at only $3.49 each, I guess I shouldn't have expected too much. The bao was a really nice soft pillowy texture though, so I think there's a lot of potential if they sauce it up a bit and get some more flavour and meat in there.  I'm still gonna go back because I really wanna try the kimchi fries they look frigging wicked.  I'll probably try out the banh mi, but it costs more than twice as much as the other places along Spadina in Chinatown and I don't know how much better they can possibly be. Has anyone tried both and can compare?"}
{"text":"Really good place. Meals were constantly being cooked when I went, which means nothing was precooked/left to sit around like a lot of places.   I like how you can pick your preferred spice level (I like things really hot). Kimchi fries are a must try, way better than I expected. Beware though, this place uses a lot of garlic."}
{"text":"Top notch banh mi and bao buns.  Banh Mi Boys know how to seriously pack in some flavor with their sandwiches and bao buns, both of which are very flavorful and reasonably priced.  You can choose from a large range of meat options, like pork belly, steak, pork, grilled chicken, and fried chicken.  You then choose your spice level, ranging from mild siracha to hot jalapenos to extremely hot habaneros, all of which help add a punch to your sandwich.  I recommend either the pork belly or the steak, but you can't go wrong with any of the choices."}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable, each selection a hit so far! I love that the menu is streamlined, and also that everything on the menu has their own flavours....like a pork belly bahn mi and a duck confit banh mi will be flavoured with diff sauces, so it's not like the same sandwich with different meat only.  I get the kimchi fries everytime, and it's amazing everytime! It's quite large too, so i could get this as a \"main\" for myself and feel perfectly full. My favourites is the pork belly banh mi, and the pork belly bao....pork belly everything! Will be back to try more of the bahn mi(s)!"}
{"text":"Service ok, food that fills you up. Waited 40mins for my tofu banh mi and pork bao. Gave my order to someone else saying we ordered the same thing. I would like to see that receipt.   Been here a couple time no issues. But I'll edit my review if I decide to give it another chance  Edit: I like the tacos here."}
{"text":"The cleanliness of the place could use an improvement.  The staff were friendly enough.  I mentioned no nuts in any of the food.  When it came time to pick up the food they mentioned they added a sauce with pine nuts.  After a bit of a fuss they did remake my order.  The food here is pretty much Asian street food.  Nothing amazing but it tasted good and fresh.  Tried the five spice pork belly steamed bao, five spice park belly banh mi and the kim chi fries.  The two sandwiches (bao and banh mi) were pretty much the same ingredients except the banh mi reminded me of a Vietnamese sandwich baguette.  The steamed bao was soft and huge (compared to other bao I've had).  The kim chi fries were good.  Nothing amazing but it was filling and big enough to share between two people.  The prices were fair and service was quick.  If I were to go back I'd much rather take my food to go as the sitting area is quite small and not cleaned very often."}
{"text":"It was good; everything is fresh. I like it even though it wasn't spicy enough for me. I had ordered Tufu fired extra spicy so I decided to eat with Tabasco and it was perfect for me. It cut the greasiness. Love it and I will go again next time. The price is valuable as well :)"}
{"text":"Very tasty food. Always buy the fried chicken bao, satisfies my cravings and melts in your mouth! The kimchi fries are also great! Recommended to try this place!"}
{"text":"Fast Vietnamese fusion style food that will give you great taste on a budget.  Pork belly bao is one of my go to's here at BMB. It's consistent and offers great flavor on a soft bun. The toppings are good and give it that Vietnamese (banh mi) flavor; cilantro, pickled carrots, etc.  Kim chi fries here are overrated because it's essentially fries with some kimchi and other spices on top. I'd recommend trying it once to say you have but the price really makes it an unattractive choice.  I've also had the fried chicken bao which is heavier if you're looking for some comfort food. The chicken is fried well and coupled with the mayonnaise topping makes it one of the heavier choices.   Service at BMB is decent as they have young servers at the till and cooking. They work fairly fast but with the volume of customers, expect to wait. It should be a quick bite but because of the nature of the equipment and personnel, don't eat here 2 min before an interview or midterm exam.  No WiFi here. Water is provided if you request it. Vanilla and cherry cokes give it a slight twist if you want some other sodas. Seating is sufficient but gets full quicklyso don't expect to have seating.  Overall, great place to grab some tasty bites on a budget."}
{"text":"You know when you get one of those random cravings for no reason? That's me with the kimchi fries here. One serving of these fries will fill me up! Every time I crave it, I make sure to get myself some when i'm in the area."}
{"text":"I have tried their duck confit banh mi and it was definitely something you won't be able to get at other banh mi places.  Their prices a kind of high for these yummy sammies but i guess they can justify that price as they throw more flavourful fusion ingredients and meats in there too.  I've also shared kimchi fries with my friends and we all enjoyed that too.  The restaurant is quite small.  It will be a long wait if you are coming with a group to eat.  Even if you were lining to order and wait for your order it can be quite the tight squeeze too."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when I ordered the grilled pork sandwich but man oh man did it blow my mind. I was concerned it might be overwhelmingly sweet but the pork is so deliciously savoury it balances the sweet pickled carrots. The bread is amazing. I now need to try everything on the menu... it's also nice to feel like I'm eating vegetables. The thing seemed to never end! I swear I'm a fast eater and I was eating for like, 20 minutes.   How to get me to tip: TARDIS tip box. good job."}
{"text":"We ordered the Five Spice Pork Belly steamed bun and Kimchi Fries. I would definitely recommend both, but if you had to pick, get the Kimchi Fries. What I did not realize with the Kimchi fries is that it contains protein too (pulled pork). This was so good and filling whether you share or just eat one by yourself. And there were so much pulled pork and kimchi with the fries.  The steamed bun was FILLED with the pork belly compared to some of the ones I have eaten at other places. The venue was just as crowded. We had to take our food to go, because there is limited seating. So be prepared to have to take your food to go, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"kimchi fries are amazing... and the 5 spice pork belly. I can't forget the taste... omg"}
{"text":"Two words - KIMCHI FRIES  The Kimchi Fries are probably one of my favourite things ever. Better than poutine, and better than any other fries+topping dish. I don't know what makes them so good, but the combination of toppings go incredibly well together. Fresh french fries, pulled pork, kimchi, a sprinkle of green onions the most delicious mayo - the perfect combination of tastes and textures. And the kimchi taste is not overpowering for those who are not huge fans!   The price point for this dish is amazing as well. At $5.99 you get a huge helping and even with sharing the dish, I am always full afterwards.  The only thing they could improve with this dish are the fries - can be hit or miss. Usually hot and fresh, but there has been the odd time when the fries are old, cold, and overcooked.   Probably a thousand calories in this box of french fry heaven, but definitely worth each and every bite :)"}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys offers a casual, comfortable dining experience for its customers at grab 'n go prices. Boasting an artfully decorated interior along with a diverse and affordable menu, this location is perfect for everyone from hungry students attending classes nearby, to those working or doing their shopping downtown.  Must-try items: Fried chicken steamed bao Kalbi beef taco Any Banh Mi (sandwich)  The kitchen space seems quite tight behind the counter, but it doesn't stop the busy staff from working together cohesively in assembly line fashion. Wait times are reasonable and every order is served hot and customized to your spice preferences. With the majority of the menu costing under $10, you could easily try most of their offerings with in 4-5 visits. I've yet to be disappointed so far and would recommend BMB to anyone looking for a food adventure."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now and I must say it was totally worth the trip! I love this place, the ambiance is actually nice if you're into trendy fast food joints and old school hip hop. The noise level really depends on the crowd seeing as the place is relatively small. During rush hour it can obviously get pretty loud but we didn't really mind it.The music, decor and overall feel of the place is actually quite great!   In terms of the food we got:  - a duck confit bahn mi - a kalbi beef bahn mi - one order of kimchi fries (big enough for two people to share as a side or for one person as an entrée) - two drinks  It all came to just over $25 so it's very reasonably priced! We loved it all! Very juicy sandwiches with well spiced meat, fresh quick pickled vegetables, a delicious tangy sauce, sriracha and fluffy bread! The kimchi fries were fresh and crunchy with moderately spiced kimchi, juicy pulled pork, mayo and scallions! Overall we really enjoyed our first visit to Bahn Mi Boys! Can't wait to try their tacos next time! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"not a bad start to some tasty sandwiches. guys landed a great location. the pulled pork taco was very good not too dry and excellent flavour to it. the pork belly is a fantastic idea but i didnt think the two flavours (salty and sweet) matched well together in this sandwich. A little bland pork belly would have been great no need to mix those flavours together.   Great value quick service!  ill be back soon once after the renos are done."}
{"text":"I haven't had banh mi since I lived in Vancouver years ago, so I was really excited to check this place out. There are a variety of different banh mi, tacos and baos on the menu, ranging in price from about $3.50-$6 per item. I had the lemongrass tofu banh mi and an order of veggie kimchi fries. The kimchi fries were surprisingly delicious - I'm a bit of a kimchi snob, since my Korean mother makes the BEST kimchi at home, but there's just something about the combination of kimchi and fries that makes these completely irresistible. My only gripe was that although everything else was fresh and flavourful, I felt like the tofu itself (in the sandwich and in the fries) didn't have a lot of taste.   Everyone here was super friendly and nice though, and I feel like Banh Mi Boys epitomizes what Toronto is all about; as I sat there eating my delicious food and listening to Tupac blaring through the speakers, people of all backgrounds and ethnicities were pouring through the door to get a taste of this fabulous fusion cuisine.  I'll totally be back to try the panko tofu bao and a tofu taco!!"}
{"text":"Love the buns (not the steamed ones) and the numerous selections of fillings (they have squid and duck!). I've tried the pork belly banh mi and have yet to try the kimchi fries. The food has a high caloric intake, so I try to not eat here too often."}
{"text":"Oh god, how have I gone this long without Banh Mi Boys?!  Got the Pork Belly Bao Buns and the Kimchi fries, both of which were delish! The steamed bao buns are stuffed with a thick slice of pork belly, cucumber, pickled veggies and hoison sauce. The Kimchi fries are a plethora of kimchi, mayo, green onions and pulled pork.   Gonna try the braised beef next time seeing as they were sold out tonight."}
{"text":"Easily some of the best fast food in Toronto, Banh Mi Boys is a Queen West classic and for good reason.  While I've tried the tacos, the salads, and have lived for days at a time off of the steamed bao, I've actually never had the Bahn Mi.  It's probably great, I just can't imagine ordering anything but the bao.  Every time I stray I enjoy what I have, but it's not the bao, and I feel like I've wasted valuable real estate in my stomach.  The tacos?  Pretty alright.  The Jicama Papaya Salad?  Solid and refreshing.  But oh, the bao!  I've tried all of their bao offerings and even talked them into diverting some of the other menu items into bao form (not always an easy feat), but really, it's all about the fried chicken.  Perfectly fried juicy meat in crisp batter, wrapped in a steamed bun that might as well be a cloud, adorned with julienned veggies and shreds of habanero. It keeps me coming back at least once a week.    The service is friendly.  Lines can be long, but food is prepped at a quick pace.  Seating is minimal, but turnover's brisk; I'm not sure why that's the case here, and not at The Burger's Priest across the street, but I'm certainly not complaining.  It's cheap, delicious, and something every Torontonian should make themselves familiar with.  There's a reason this humble fast food joint is on Joanne Kates' Top 100 every year.  You'll have it, you'll like it, and then you'll wake up some nights at 3:30 in the morning wishing you could be eating it right then and there.    I swear one day I'll get around to trying the Kimchi Fries.  Some day.  When I can pry myself off the bao."}
{"text":"Not all new locations of well-loved Toronto restaurants are created equal.  The original Burger's Priest is always hailed as superior to the Yonge Street location.  Rock Lobster Ossington and Rock Lobster Queen West have frustratingly divergent menus that have sent me rushing between them with a cab of out-of-towners on at least one occasion in search of bisque.  But this, the first expanded location of the Queen West staple?  Totally on the mark.  Everything I've had here was precisely the same in its execution as at the original location, to which I've also given five stars.  This is not haute cuisine, but this is cheap and cheerful eats done with great flavors, great consistency, and an eye for quality.  If you're in the mood for a quick snack, a single steamed bao is the perfect solution; check out my Queen West review to see me wax poetic, emblazoning the Fried Chicken Bao from head to toe.  Two of them make a meal, three of them make me stumble about with slight regret.    Like the Queen West location service is friendly, food is quick, and the surroundings are clean and comfortable.  Unlike the Queen West location I've never had to hover around holding my food waiting for a seat; it's as if the swarm of Ryerson students, and the gamer and geek crowd milling between 401 and Silver Snail (whom I love), just haven't quite figured this place out yet.  If you live in Toronto but haven't ever eaten at Banh Mi Boys, get there ASAP.  You're missing out on one of the best quick bites the city has to offer."}
{"text":"For all the hype and talk about this place, it does actually make a  good sandwich.   A restaurant with a simple concept and a limited menu, but I think that's probably a good thing.  I got the beef cheek bahn mi with a side of kimchi fries.  The sandwich itself was flavourful and the bread was nice and crunchy - although it could have used a bit more sauce.  The best part really was really the kimchi fries that were loaded with all sorts of good stuff (kimchi, beef, mayo, green onions...) and definitely made for sharing.  There isn't much seating, but it's definitely a good lunch spot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Found a hair in my duck confit salad last week. They gave me my money back but I'm pretty grossed out so I won't be coming back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"While it was slightly difficult to find parking nearby, this place is soooo worth it. When I saw several people in line during lunchtime on a Friday, I knew it was going to be great. I only had to wait less than 5 minutes to place my order with a very friendly clerk, then less than 15 minutes to receive my order. In any case, these employees work f-ing fast. Since the place was packed, I took my order to go and was so excited that I actually ate it in the car. I had the Duck Confit Banh Mi filled with warm, juicy duck confit, a marinated carrot and daikon slaw, cilantro, some jalapeno slices, in a really perfect baguette (slightly crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside). A total flavor bomb! I would order this again and again. The next day, I had a Pulled Pork Steamed Bao which had tender, moist pulled pork and similar ingredients in a clam-style steamed bun. Excellent! The same could be said about their crispy Sweet Potato Fries. My toddler daughter loved them too. A definite go-to place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch! Came here at 1pm to avoid the rush.  Had the pork belly banh mi and kimchi fries - full of amazing flavor!  Savory meat, pickled carrots and radish on fresh baguette bread. It's a great mix of Vietnamese and Korean!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Friend and I split the duck confit and Kalbi Banh Mi. The duck was so rich and well seasoned. Kalbi is great with the sauce that they marinate the meat in. Best to order your sandwiches with a side of fresh jalapenos. Adds a lil heat at no extra cost. Sandwiches were stuffed with so much meat and reasonably priced at around $5. Try to come here during early lunch hours as the line goes out the door and seating is very limited. I'll be back to try their spicy kim chi fries and pork Bao"}
{"text":"I definitely overhyped myself for this place, it was definitely good, but I was expecting mind blowing. If you manage your expectations you will be very pleased. I had a fried chicken steamed bun and a five spice pork belly steamed bun with jalapeño, both were tasty, but I liked the fried chicken best. Don't be fooled, these steamed buns are quite large, I expected more of a snack size. My husband  had the Kalbi beef Banh Mi and it was good."}
{"text":"After my friend gave me a small bit of his Grilled Pork Sandwich, just that one bite.. I dreamt about Banh Mi boys that very night..  I have tried:  Pork Belly Bao Kimichi Fries Grilled Chicken Banh Mi and my favourite is still Grilled Pork with that extra Thai chili!!  The toasted bun so warm and crusty  The pork so soft and juicy  The lemongrass so aromatic   The pickled veggie and or course that extra chili so spicy!  Hmmm... Just thinking about it, I know what I am going to dream about tonight! My Porky Banh Mi Boys!!"}
{"text":"Just maybe I am bias or just maybe the first love is just more memorable.  This new Banh Mi Boys is just not the same as the one on Queen West.  My Grilled Pork Banh Mi ($4.99) was not as good compared to the one I had before. Maybe the way the bread was toasted? the grilled pork was not as flavoured. And where's my Thai chili?!  I really don't know why?! Maybe I need to have the same sandwich and do a taste test side by side.   But I would pick a Banh Mi Boys' Banh Mi over any other sandwich option in the area."}
{"text":"Was looking for something new and different and thanks to Yelp, discovered this little hole in the wall place.   The friendly cashier lady suggested sometime different for each of our group of 4. We tried and loved the pork belly sandwich and the kimchi fries.  Other than finding  it hard to locate a seat it was a wonderful tasty experience!  Will be back if I am in the area for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! Everything tastes amazing and fresh! Had been to their original downtown location many times and usually you don't expect it to be as good. But let me tell you, far exceeded my expectation! We are making this place a regular weekly spot! :)"}
{"text":"omg so good for the pork belly buns???i cannot help eating more than 3. just love it.."}
{"text":"omg fantastic baos especially five spice pork belly bun! I had one andfinished it in 3mins then got another one. So delicious"}
{"text":"I've been to Banh Mi Boys a few times already, and the food never seems to disappoint. I ordered the kimchi fries and the five spice pork belly on a steamed bao. Every other time that I've been here I've ordered a banh mi, and really wanted to give the steamed bao a try. The steamed bao itself was wonderful; soft, fresh and just like a good dim sum bao. The combination of the pork belly and the toppings was amazing, as usual, and the addition of the kimchi, pulled pork, mayo and green onions all make the fries wonderfully delicious."}
{"text":"This was only my second time coming to Banh Mi Boys. I remember coming here once for lunch a few years ago and being like \"meh\" and thinking it was overhyped. Decided to give it another try, and wow I feel completely differently now! I stopped by around 7:30 PM on a Friday night just to grab a sandwich to go. The place was full, with no available seating, and there was quite a lineup to order and pick up food. Based on Yelp reviews, I decided to get the five spice pork belly banh mi. I think the prices here are pretty reasonable, as my sandwich ended up being less than $7 after tax, and was a sufficient portion for me for dinner. It made me wish I worked closer so I could come for lunch! Although I did have to wait a while for my sandwich to be ready, I could see the staff trying to work really quickly to get everyone's order prepped as fast as possible, although it's not even like they're half-assing it because they will ask you how spicy you want your sandwich and let you customize some of the veggies and stuff in it. The people who work there also seem really nice and friendly! In terms of the actual banh mi, it was delicious. The pork belly was so soft and juicy, and there was just this wonderful mixture of flavours in the sandwich... the salty/slightly smoky flavour from the pork, the sour taste of the pickled radish, the distinct flavour of the cilantro, and the refreshing flavours from the carrots and cucumbers. Everything just tasted so fresh, and combined so perfectly, there were just all these wonderful bursts of flavour in my mouth as I was eating. So damn good. And the kicker was the bread/baguette, because it wasn't hard/stale as baguettes have a tendency to get. Perfection!  I will most definitely be back to try other things, as I have my eye on the duck confit sandwich, and pulled pork. Also determined to try their baos and tacos! The only thing is that I wish the place was bigger and had more seating, because it would be nice to eat in. But what can you do, this is place is just too popular, and with good reason."}
{"text":"If you want something quick, tasty and cheap then hit this place up - it never disappointments! Service is fast and efficient as you go up and place your order. I love their kimchi fries (must try!) but I substitute it with the beef instead since I can't have pork.  Also love their sandwiches, baos and tacos.  The meat is flavorful, the toppings are usually pickled, and overall the combination is delicious."}
{"text":"This place was deliciously awesome.  Great fun fibe too.  Tried a.bit if everything, grilled pork banh mi, pork belly Bao, kimchi fries..Even had tofu..All was delish and prices are really reasonable.  Try out the menu with friends so you can have tastes of a variety."}
{"text":"Apparently there's quite a bit of buzz around Banh Mi Boys, so on my last trip through Toronto I stopped in to have a Kalbi beef sandwich and some sweet potato fries. I'm gonna keep this short and sweet - the food is decent. Some people think it's all OMGWTFBBQ, but I mean, it's a sandwich that's decently-priced and tastes good. The sweet potato fries were just a touch too greasy, but that's ok, I guess. It's a small place and it's crowded and noisy when it's busy (which is... always). It's a nice place to drop in for a quick to-go order. I'll be back."}
{"text":"What can I say, this place never disappoints! I will start off with a warning - if you are coming here for lunch, I strongly suggest ordering it from ritual for pick up, or coming before/after the lunch rush. Some days you may get lucky with a decent line up, other days it is out the door! I've been coming here about once a week, as I can't resist the temptation! The space is pretty small and you are usually squished like sardines waiting to order. There is some seating but not a lot and at lunch it is always occupied.  The kimchi fries are my absolute favourite and a must-try for anyone entering this establishment! I had the tofu fries and they were disappointing in comparison. My typical order consists of kimchi fries and a bao or taco - after this, I am stuffed! My order usually comes to around $12 with tax. The panko tofu bao I think is my favourite. Crunchy tofu complimented by the soft bao dough is just heavenly. I also really enjoy the pork taco. This is a regular spot for me and I can't imagine life without it! If you haven't been, I strongly suggest checking it out!"}
{"text":"I have always loved viets buns and this place takes that to the next level. They have so many delicious selections, and all of them are amazing. I have had the duck and the pork belly bahns, as well as their kimchi poutine. Fast service for great food and great prices."}
{"text":"5 star. Best fusion Banh Mi in the city. Kimchi fries are great for sharing. Kalbi beef banh mi is my go to. Don't fret if you don't see an empty seat, traffick moves in fast and out. More locations (King West, St.Lawrence Market area) are needed."}
{"text":"This place is in point  Had the kalbi beed banh mi, pork belly bao, and some Kim chi fries. I can't even describe how good it was....look at the pictures.  Reel me in because I'm hooked."}
{"text":"Great spot to stop in.  Really enjoyed my food.  I ate two tacos and was full for around ten dollars. I had the beef taco & steamed bao pulled pork.  The beef taco had way more flavour.  Service was good, don't sit near the door on a cold day...gets breezy for sure.  I'll be back here again."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. I venture hear at least once a week, and I do to live that close. The value is incredible, but I would still go even it wasn't   Keep doing what you guys are doing!"}
{"text":"I went on a Friday evening with a friend and got the Banh Mi Beef Cheek Sandwich. The lineup was about 5 minutes and a friendly cook calls you up to get your order from the counter. I asked for \"mild\" but probably would have gone for \"medium\" or \"spicy\" since the friend I was with got a \"spicy\" and she said it wasn't that bad.  The flavours are fantastic and there is a pickled something in the sandwich that adds so much good stuff to the overall experience. Also, I got the sweet potato fries and they were heavenly. I would highly recommend them. They also have Kimchi fries so that may be worth a try the next time I'm there.  Overall, fantastic!"}
{"text":"5 Spice Pork Belly is great.  Come here for good quick food, and relatively cheap.  Not a restaurant, more like fast food."}
{"text":"It's my second time here. I thought I'll try something else than the baguette bread which last time I got the chicken one, I found it too salty to my taste.   Even going after 2 pm on a Sunday afternoon, the place was packed; the tiny seating area, the line up and the people waiting for their food. I was shocked that people were eating this late!! I decided to wait it out and it was definitely worth it!!!  I tried their papaya salad which was a nice portion for $3.50 and it was fresh and crunchy. I also had their panko tofu bao which didn't disappoint. It was fried tofu which I didn't expect and full of veggies inside which I loved. It was a nice afternoon snack for a beautiful sunny day!!   Verdict:  I wanted more!! I wanted to try their other combinations!! And the prices are awesome!! The question is: when are you opening in Mississauga??   Why 4 stars only?? Minus one for the wait time even though they had a lot of staff in the open kitchen. If the place was bigger, a larger seating area would have been nice."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a small trendy establishment known for their Vietnamese subs. Banh Mi Boys is actually touted as being able to provide a modern take on the traditional banh mi with an Asian twist. They also have a few other Asian-fusion items on their menu including variations of steamed bao, tacos and fries. A friend and I arrived a little after 3:30 pm thinking that the lunch crowd would have subsided. How wrong we were! The place was still packed, with line ups nearing out to the front door.   One thing that caught my eyes was the kimchi fries ($5.99). While the idea of mixing fermented sour cabbage with french fries may not sound the most appetizing. I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try this rather interesting mixture, and ordered a box of it to share. The portion may look tiny from the picture, but it was enough for two. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised that the combination of fries, kimchi, and pulled pork went well together, and provided an intricate taste.  My friend and I ordered the five spiced pork belly banh mi ($5.99) and kalbi banh mi ($5.99). The subs were cut in half so we had one of each. The pork belly was seasoned nicely and served on a toasted sandwich with carrots, Japanese pickle cucumbers, cilantro, and mayo. My personal favorite has to be the kalbi banh mi, as the marinated sauce that coded the sandwich provided a nice tang to the flavor. I also liked the fact that they didn't skimp out on the kalbi.  I also ordered the five spiced pork belly steamed bao ($3.49). I really enjoyed the combination of the tender pork belly and soft bun, as it created a very interesting contrast of taste. The only thing that I didn't like was that the pork belly was a little too fatty for me but overall it was good.  There wasn't much service as it's pretty much a takeout place. You'd need to line up, ordered your food at the cashier, and then move along down the line to grab your food when it's ready. Overall, I think that Banh Mi Boys is a great place to grab a quick lunch or dinner, and it's very affordable too for what you get."}
{"text":"Good service and reasonable prices. Admittedly, the sandwiches are small when on the steamed Chinese-style bread, but grab a side of fries and you're all set. Better for lunch than for dinner, I'd say, but if you're on a budget head on down and try it out!"}
{"text":"I always get the grilled pork, medium spicy - always fresh and tasty.  There are other places on Spadina Ave. that sell Viet sandwiches but  Banh Mi Boys is so much better with their hot (grilled) juicy meat with just the right amount of sauce.   This place can have long lines during busy hours so we usually go there really early (around 11:30am) so the waiting time is normally less than 10 mins."}
{"text":"Okay I may have permanently set my expectation for steamed baos a little too high after having the steamed baos from Ippudo in NYC, so to be fair this is actually pretty decent (I've had far worse). The kimchi fries, however, was something I've never had, and it was okay...not as good as I'd imagined fries and kimchi to be. The banh mi sandwich is good too but again, nothing spectacular. But I do like the casual, fast food style of this restaurant, because it just makes eating these a lot more enjoyable and fun."}
{"text":"Banh mi is a product of French colonialism. Banh Mi Boys is a product of Torontoism. The East meets West fusion décor reflects the cross cultural philosophy of Banh Mi Boys.   The heaviness of the melt-in-your mouth pork belly ($5.99) was offset by the acidity of the pickled carrot and fresh cilantro. It was a delicious modern take on the traditional Chinatown Banh mi! Yes, expect self-loathing gym trips after this fat filled unison. The sandwich embodies guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is great. I love banh mi and they just take it to the next level - freshly toasted baguette and fresh fillings. It's fairly inexpensive and the line moves pretty quick. They have a lot of different options and I was quite pleased with my 5 spice pork belly. The only complaint I have is that the sitting area wasn't super clean, but I mean it's a fast food place. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always love getting pork banh mi and kimchi fries!"}
{"text":"BEST place i've been to in a while. So sad its not closer to the downtown core cuz its far from my place or my work.  I got the pork belly sandwich and the kimchi fries.  My god.  Amazing! Going back tomorrow to eat more"}
{"text":"Great business, I had a pleasure of going here with my significant other. Would go here on a daily basis if I lived closer. The food is excellent so is the service. I struck a friendly and courteous conversation with one of the chiefs about the Nexus 4 phone my friend was using. Selling tasty sandwiches and good customer service in my books is a great combination for repeat customer. Only complaint I have is that it has limited seating but it's cause they are a small start up and have a simple good business. Make the consumers happy with good products and services!"}
{"text":"The food here is 100% exceptional and it's a must try if you're downtown. Not the prettiest of places with limited seating but they do have Ritual to bypass the line. Everything is reasonably price with Banh mi's priced around $6 and Baos priced at $4. Tried the friend chicken bao & grilled chicken Banh mi and I can say without a doubt that they hit the spot.  The prized item in the menu here are the Kimchi fries which in my opinion are the main attraction here!"}
{"text":"The Kimchi fries were great.  The duck confit was decent. The pork belly bao was a bit mediocre because of its blandness and because it was cold.  I'm actually not sure if it was cooked enough."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I have to give this place 3 stars. I'm from Calgary and we have vietnamese subs everywhere and honestly this place doesn't compare. They have an interesting menu here but the flavour doesn't quite hit it on the mark. I feel like it's missing some things in their food. They don't even put a good sauce in their subs. Even if it's like $6 or $7, i'm still hungry after.   Go to calgary and get a thai thai sub and you'll know what I'm talking about. It's juicy, bread is flaky, many different flavours for subs - it's awesome"}
{"text":"Yuh-um. I feel dumb. This place has been around for a few years now and I've walked by dozens of times and have been working a five minute walk away for months and yesterday was the first time I ate one of their bahn mis. Well call mi reformed because I will be back to this church of taste again soon.   $6.50 for a fresh and delicious tofu banh mi? Paying under $10 for a decent lunch these days is no small feat so I gotta celebrate this full size chewy soft white baguette, filled with lots o' tofu in a lemongrass mushroom sauce, pickled carrots and daikon and (opon request) no cilantro. Again I say: yum."}
{"text":"I had the kimchi fries and the pulled pork bao. Both were delicious, ESPECIALLY the kimchi fries. My husband was iffy about the kimchi fries because he is not a huge fan of kimchi, but he ended up eating more than he thought. I was disappointed because I wanted the kimchi fries to myself, LOL.   The only downside is that is it located in Toronto,  both locations in busy areas. I absolutely hate excessively busy places. The shop itself is extremely busy as well, and very limited seating. This is something I also am not a fan of.   I would love to go back some time, I just really hate the excessively busy factor, inside and outside (its location). I probably will not be back as often as I would like but for those who don't mind it being busy, I would recommend you try it. Food is excellent.  PS. Please open a shop north of Toronto :D"}
{"text":"Everything here is good. They are fast, efficiency and give you food on the buck. Super worth it and you can always eat it on the street if there's no spots to sits. On the last note their employees are all friendly and nice. I love this place."}
{"text":"I go there EVERYTIME i visit downtown. I always order the 5 spice pork belly banh mi and it never fails me. Their habanero and jalapeno peppers are nice and fresh, giving it a nice kick. This is one of my all time favorite restaurants! Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"The first time I went I had the beef brisket bahn mi, and it was amazing - just like everyone said it would be.  So I went a second time, ordered the same thing and found a hair in my sandwich. I pulled it out, and found another hair.... which was attached to a huge HAIR CLUMP. So I will not be returning but I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because my first experience there was good."}
{"text":"A slightly fancier version of what you can find at any Vietnamese bakery.  I bet most patrons at Banh Mi Boys don't know they can get almost the same food for about one third of the price. I suppose people will pay for a hipster location and kitschy items like Kim-chi Poutine that is nothing more then kim-chi and mayo on fries. Not poutine at all."}
{"text":"Food: Great place for Vietnamese fast food / comfort food. I'm a sucker for fries and the tofu fries are to die for. Far better than any other vegetarian poutine I've had! The fries themselves have a good structure and the marinated tofu + kimchi is just so flavourful! I also really like the lemongrass tofu banh mi - great marinade / sauce on the tofu, fresh bun and veggies.  Atmosphere and service: Definitely more of a quick serve / casual place, which makes it feel more authentic to true Vietnam!"}
{"text":"Nice modern fast food restaurant in the heart of Chinatown (behind McDonald's at Queen and Spadina) for Vietnamese and Korean influenced sandwiches and tacos. Had Kalbi and pulled pork tacos at $3.99 each and it did not disappoint! Very tasty and would come back anytime I am in the area!  Also loved the retro Coca cola drinks they have in the fridge~"}
{"text":"First time at this Gerrard location. It's easily walk-able from Yonge and Dundas square and surprisingly at around 5PM it wasn't busy at all with lots of tables available!   I decided to try their \"baos\" for the first time as I am a huge fan of baos in general because of the sweet bun taste however I was disappointed. My bao was very cold (not sure if it's supposed to be that way) and it didn't surprise me with flavors. I also ordered my favorite Kalbi beef taco and sure enough it never disappoints.  Overall I definitely recommend for a quick, cheap and tasty bite!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner and loved it. Their tofu fries were surprisingly delicious and has the tofu taco.  The taco was good but was a little messy to eat.  Prices are reasonable and quick service too.  The one thing I wouldn't order again is the papaya salad.  It's quite the rip off.  Everything else is good to go."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys now joins my list of Toronto cheap eats. For a little over $5, you can get yourself a filling banh mi sandwich. I ordered the duck confit banh mi and the sweet potato fries. The banh mi was tasty and the duck tasted, well, like duck. I wish they offered a duck confit bao. I've had that before in Seattle and it was excellent. I thought that the sweet potato fries were a little too salty and could have done without, since the sandwich was so filling.  This place is busy busy busy. We lined up to order take out and it probably took 15 minutes to get in and out. It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's like, a dollar a bun guys! Did you expect Celine Dion to serenade you?  Tried pretty much everything on the menu, it's a fail safe, cheap, stomach-filling yet palatable place to eat.    The girl doing the orders looks pretty bitchy but she's hot, and probably has to deal with a sh*t tonne of douchey customers on a daily basis so you shouldn't expect more from her than she does from you.   Yes these dishes are like, so easy to make, then why not make it yourself at home? Restaurants operate businesses based on either technique or by providing convenience and in this case you're clearly paying just for the labour price of making a bun.   Overall this place is an excellent no frills experience for a late night, quick grab o' bite. If you want a real meal go to a real restaurant. It's your responsibility to fill up your own expectation gap."}
{"text":"I was glad they opened a place near where I worked: BMB was a source of decent, reliable grub.   Granted, the menu items are a bit heavy and left me feeling sloth-like so I wouldn't recommend a visit before work...definitely post-work/whatever to help kick-start that melatonin release. Not a science grad.  But while the food was good, it's not something I'd go out of my way to eat.  The pickled veg was killer."}
{"text":"I gotta hand it to you, Toronto, you really have the \"cheap filling lunches\" game on lock!   Here's how to tackle Banh Mi Boys:   1. Walk to the counter. 2. Close your eyes.  3. Point to anything on the menu.  ...and yeah, that's pretty much it.  From steamed buns and banh mi to kimchi fries (which are my new addiction), you can't go wrong here! My favorites are the Kalbi Beef taco (which is huge for $4) and the Pork Belly bahn mi. Deliciously seasoned meat, fresh veggies and crisp cilantro, topped with spicy kimchi and wrapped in a charred tortilla or fresh French bread...  Okay, I'm drooling again.   Do yourself a favor and get a little Banh Mi Boys in your life. You might wait around for a bit in line, you may have a hard time finding a table, but suck it up. It's this popular for a reason!"}
{"text":"Five star Vietnamese street food all day yo! Bao buns, loaded fries, bah mi sandys...all are fantastic and take your taste buds straight to flavortown. Loaded fries are one of the best things I have ever eaten and up third with the unhealthiest but they are a must. Their Bao buns are large and in charge and topped with lightly pickled carrots and cucumber, the same ones your find on their Bah Mi sandys!  Sandwiches are also big, fresh bread, delicious. Seating limited and the vibe is lit af, I think that's how the kids say it these days. Like many of the cool joints around toronto 90's hip hop seems to always be playing. Stop on and listen while you enjoy some funky fresh flavors. I'd go right now if I could."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot during the week. Gets busy very quick so if you're wanting to get food try and go early or later in the afternoon. Not totally blown away, but a good price for what you get."}
{"text":"Yummy,yummy.Exotic sandwiches.you can order all on menus....!I like to go there again..!By the way My favourite is duck."}
{"text":"For a quick bite before the movies we came here for their kimchi fries, five spice pork belly bao and grilled pork banh mi. The bao was perfectly fluffy and the pickled carrots/radishes provided a nice sweet and sour pairing to the fatty pork. The Kimchi fries were super flavourful and could have been eaten as a meal on its own. This location was far less hectic than the ones downtown.  There were lots of open seating and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Review purely for the Banh Mi as that's all we got to try. Solid Banh Mi Place. Thanks yelp for the tip. Bread crispness was perfect. Flavoring of the five spice pork was impeccable. We got there around 1330 and beat the rush, still full the the brim with customers though! I'd like to come back and try the other menu items."}
{"text":"I've been a long time fan of this place. I've had their baos, banh mi, and kimchi fries and everything is consistently delicious for a reasonable price. There's not a lot of seating space inside, it's more of a takeout place. It's always really busy especially during lunch hours so order ahead (on Ritual) if you want to skip the line."}
{"text":"This place is seriously amazing. I rarely give out five star reviews while traveling since I tend to be pickier about where I spend my time. Banh Mi Boys is the kind of place that is worth seeking out and going to even if you only have limited time visiting Toronto. I would most definitely be a regular if I lived here given the excellent food at good prices.  I ordered the tofu fries which just might be one of the best things I have eaten all year. Delicious. I need to go back and get them again before I leave town!  I also ordered the steamed bao--panko tofu which was also unique and very, very good. I think I might put some hot sauce on it next time, but it still was delicious to the max."}
{"text":"Coming from LA where I can get a legit, simple banh mi for a good price, I thought the Bahn Mi Boys were pretty standard. Don't get me wrong, the spiced meat sandwich was pretty good and had a really good flavor to them, but nothing else in the sandwich really stood out.   Also tried the kimchi fries which were pretty good and complemented the sandwich. I would say it's a pretty good price for what you get, but it does a pretty nice spin on Asian Fusion."}
{"text":"Good, cheap eats in the busy Ryerson area. What more can you ask for when everything is about under $10 and you can be full too? I love this place for a quick bite that won't break the bank and is actually delicious and filling. The baos and Banh mis are satisfying and a nice alternative to mcds. There's not a lot of seating but everyone finishes fast and just comes and goes."}
{"text":"Awesome! Just awesome! We had steamed baos and kimchi fries. They're only about $10 in total. Both taste fantastic! Love the way they combine both western and eastern elements in their food."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto and this place was recommended by my friend who lives here.  Yup, they are worth all five stars.  The long line moved fast and my two sandwiches (grilled pork and pulled pork) were both delicious and had a lot of meat.  Service was efficient and friendly, but seriously, it's about the food, right?  And BMB delivers the goods!"}
{"text":"I was passing by this place today and decided to see what all the fuss is about since they opened a new location close to my home.   The restaurant is hard to notice from the street, but is very nice looking once you step inside. Everything is nice, clean & organized, with a certain urban vibe. I loved that everything had its place since they don't have a lot of room to begin with.  I was lucky enough to be there when they only had a few people inside; they will have trouble handling any groups larger than ~8.   I ordered the pulled pork banh mi & the Kim chi fries. The sandwich was a bit dry for pulled pork, I was definitely looking forward to something a bit more juicy.. I only ate half of it since after a few bites I found a small hair, and that was a turn-off for me.   The Kim chi fries, on the other hand, were absolutely delicious! The right amount of topping and mayo, & the fries weren't too bad either.  All in all, I don't think it was that special. Ginger has the same kinds of sandwiches for cheaper. I might go back for the fries :)"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasnt already been said? The Kalbi beef with kimchi is amazing! The flavors work so well together. I grabbed one on my way to the airport. The sandwich was so good! It was worth getting yelled at by customs =)"}
{"text":"Edit:   This time it was better though they looked like they were closing 45 minutes before their closing time.   The fries have improved but the portions are smaller. I still love the fried chicken bao.   -----  This is probably the last time I will be visiting banh mi boys, since the establishment open. It was my frequent hang out spot with the great feeling of warm baos and crispy kimchi fries. The quality has been deteriorating ever since it expanded from one location to two.   The banh mi is definitely questionable, the meat was either going bad and they dose it in sauce. Not to mention, the grilled chicken banh mi was missing the chicken. Only a sliver of the protein was found.   The fries were definitely better but for a while the fries were very soggy and not crispy, so definitely a hit or miss.   The seating is limited, there is always a line, and the place is filthy as a poster mentioned below. I mean there is dust behind the lighting in the seats and sometimes there is crumbs of a banh mi someone left behind.   I really wanted to love this place because it had a great story! I tried the kimchi fries way back at cne and it clearly is taking a sky dive downhill."}
{"text":"A definite must when I'm in downtown Toronto.  Kimchi fries are surprisingly good.  If I were to go back now I'd order the pork banh mi and the tacos, but I think everything is pretty good and worth a try."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys serves some of the best sandwiches I have ever tried and at an economical price.  I tried the Grilled Pork Banh Mi ($5.50) and the sandwich was very flavorful! The meat was tender, juicy, and perfectly marinated with a lightly sweet sauce. The carrots and cucumber were fresh and crisp. This sandwich was perfect! The place is small and there was a line when I visited but the service was quick and the line moved quickly. Overall, this was the best dining value on my recent visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"It was my first time at BMB - so I went with the grilled pork banh mi.  It was five stars for sure!  Great flavor, perfect spiciness - and such a deal!  I also had the jicama salad which was crisp and fresh.  I can't wait to try the Bao!!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets for cheap eats. Everything is cheap, delicious, and maybe somewhat healthy. The sandwiches, tacos, and baos are all great... pretty sure I've had at least one of each.  Service is fast and competent. The restaurant generally plays early 90s hip hop from what I remember, which is kind of funny."}
{"text":"I've already reviewed the Queen and Spadina location, but since I started working at Ryerson I constantly feel obliged to heap additional praise on Banh Mi Boys.  I've realized that the superb meatball sandwich ($5.50, ~6.75 after tax) competes directly with Subway at the same price point. It's a smaller sandwich than the footlong, but not by that much - definitely a good amount for lunch at around 9 inches. And, like everything else here, it's delicious - meaty and fresh, with a nice satay-like sauce that the menu oddly refers to as \"peanut butter\".  The five dollar footlongs we enjoyed for a bit are now a distant dream, and while Subway and other restaurants are raising prices to keep up with rising food costs, Banh Mi Boys holds steady and provides stellar value and excellent food. The most expensive sandwich at Banh Mi Boys comes in at about 9$ after taxes, and it contains duck - in a city of endless 10$+ sandwiches, that's impressive.  BMB is fast too - your order should take about as much time as an average fast food order.  I haven't been to the Subway across the street since I started working here, and I don't plan to go any time soon. Long live Banh Mi Boys, kings of Toronto cheap eats."}
{"text":"Found myself chewing on an elastic included in my papaya salad. Food here is affordable and used to be a favorite, but the elastic in my food seems dangerous"}
{"text":"As I mentioned in a previous review, I'm generally not a big fan of sandwiches but sometimes I get hungry and just want a quick fix without going through the whole kit and caboodle of getting a knife and fork involved.  I've heard/read good things about Banh Mi Boys so I popped in. Never been. So I asked the cashier which sandwiches are popular. She said the 5 Spice Pork Belly and the Kalbi Beef . So I ordered a pork belly sandwich and a Braised Beef steamed bao.  I don't really know what the big deal is about these sandwiches. Maybe it's just that I'm a sandwich hater at heart.  The beef bao was decent but neither really wowed me.  If I get hungry while walking by a Banh Mi Boys location again, maybe I'll give the Kalbi Beef sandwich a go. Or maybe I'd be better off just looking for a good pho spot."}
{"text":"I asked the cashier which sandwich is popular and she recommended the beef. It tasted great!"}
{"text":"The Kimchi fries and Kalbi Beef Taco's are great!  They make good fusion food, it worth the wait."}
{"text":"The service is ok but I didn't like the food, I think the mix of meat with the raw veggies is not for me. I had the pulled pork steambao"}
{"text":"Banh-mi was good but don't get what the hype is all about. It was above average but definitely not \"OMG THE GREATEST EVERRRRR.!\" Kimchi fries were yummy! Lots of food for cheap."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here. Had the sweet potato fries and the green papaya salad. Interior has a few seats if you want to dine in, or you could grab and go.   My one complaint is that there doesn't seem to be recycling. Please add this!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The fried chicken bao is actually the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. It's smallish so one is perfect for a small meal but they are less than $5 so you can buy two if you're really hungry. They also travel well."}
{"text":"Pork belly banh mi - get in my belly! Can I just say that this place is the bomb and if it were up to me I would be eating banh mis and baos all day, everyday. Try out their secret menu club bao - delicious twist of fried chicken and pork belly - YUM!"}
{"text":"Went here on a recent trip to Toronto. Saw these guys on the Food Network and just looking at the menu makes my mouth salivate. The new location is within walking distance from Toronto Eaton Centre and Ryerson University.  It gets pretty busy during lunch hour (or any hour for that matter). Food is prepared to order. It is relatively cheap for classic Banh Mi sandwiches ($6-7, depending on the choices) - and there were so many choices.   Had the Kimchi Fries - which is like an Asian poutine - contains lots of fries, kimchi, pulled pork, and spices.  Squid banh mi - who would have thought about putting squid onto a Vietnamese sandwich? Anyway, really tasty.  If you want a quick satisfying lunch or dinner, order 2 or 3 steamed bao - bingo!  Will definitely come here next time I'm in town :)"}
{"text":"I didn't know sandwiches could taste this good. I got the panko crusted tofu bao and I didn't know tofu could taste this good either.  Make sure you get the kimchi fries, even if you don't like kimchi. You won't be disappointed! But the regular fries are awful, soggy, and bland. To be honest I wouldn't even eat them for free.  Also the prices here are amazing. I bought TWO sandwiches and kimchi fries for just $12!"}
{"text":"Overrated for that rating.  I ordered the grilled chicken banh mi, taste was very mediocre, the bread was definitely not re-heated properly... outside so soggy and there is no bread flavour.  The service was nice, and at least the pickled veggies are some why fresh.  If you are looking for a not authentic banh mi for 6-7$, then this is perfect. For people who have actually tasted a real banh mi would probably never come back here again."}
{"text":"This place really doesn't need another review, but it has a piece of my heart ever since my first taste a year ago... and it feels a disservice for not having given it a five-star rating it deserves!  ATMOSPHERE: Trendy, hip, modern fast-food style joint. It's pretty small, so not good for large groups. Even for groups of 3-4, waiting for a table could take a while. There's also a mini bar seating fine for indies. May just wanna take out. And many do just do take-out here regularly. The lines move fast.  SERVICE: Super fast service. You order at counter and move along side to wait for your order. Service is helpful and friendly.  PRICE: Very affordable! Ranging from $5-$10 dollars per item, no wonder students and working folks flock here throughout the day! You could easier order multiple things to share, or two for yourself. If this was closer to me, I'd go much more frequently... am anticipating their soon-to-open new location!  FOOD: Delish! Amazing flavours jam-packed in each item. Amount of heat us up to you - server will ask you when you're about to get your order. I've tried many things on the menu, and many items are GOOD. But to keep it short, here are my Top 3: duck confit banh mi, kim chi fries, and pork belly steamed bao.  I like the duck confit best out of all the banh mi options because it has the best bread-to-filing-and-sauce ratio. I find the other banh mi too dry. But the duck confit? Saucy level is perfect!  Kim chi fries are just amazing! Flavours are incredible. If you just want a snack and not a full taco, bun or bao, this hits the spot.  The pork belly steamed bao is a great competitor to steamed baos offered by other shops in the city. It is my favourite because I think you get the biggest bang for your buck!  Everything about this place keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of those rare places that have kept up an outstanding level of deliciousness and stood the test of time over years! A fantastic spot for incredibly tasty banh mi sandwiches! their kimchi fries are also amazing! Do yourself a favor and go get some now!"}
{"text":"Tried both branches at Queen West and also Yonge and both excellent choices! Cheap, quick, with maximum flavour! Very clean and comfortable fast food joint, too. My friend who lives in London Ontario actually aims to come here every time she comes visit Toronto that's how good it is! Highly recommend. Only reason not a 5 star for me is...I don't give out 5 stars to fast food joints lol"}
{"text":"one of the few chains i would go over and over again and proud to say i go to. quick, easy, tastey = never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Ok, ok. I get it! I do. The kimchi fries were amazing.  Even better than I'd hoped, with the awesome pulled pork, the creamy mayo, the fresh green onions, the everything.  It was super delicious and I like it much better than their fare with pickled veggies. I'm glad I went back.  The kimchi was quite mild - I wish I knew where they got it from because I'd love to buy some!  All the flavour with no heat - I could make great food with it at home.  The fries were a little dark - the oil needed to be changed - but they were nice and crispy on the outside, and smooth and tender on the inside.  Would love to try their duck confit and some of their other less popular dishes without pickled veggies sometime!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite quick grab n go lunch places. The kalbi banh mi, the fried chicken steamed bun, the kimchi fries, the duck confit bahn mi, they're all beyond delicious. I stick with getting just the jalapeno peppers and it's spicy enough.   You can't get better food for that price in Toronto."}
{"text":"Freaking tasty and delicious! Get the kimchi fries and the spicy pork belly sandwich.  Also had the tacos and they were awesome. Very good prices and really yummy food. Good for people who want to try something new!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  There can be quite a line up during the lunch rush hour, and considering it's right off one of the busiest corners in Toronto, the service speed isn't bad at all.  They have great priced baos that fit their chosen spiciness level as advertised, as I've tried all levels - and the kimchi fries were a great novelty experience at first, and a good choice everytime I've gone back."}
{"text":"Four stars for the Pork Belly sandwich but two stars for the service (due to the super long wait time). I came here on a Friday lunch and was immediately welcomed with a long queue that filled the whole restaurant.   I've always enjoyed Bahn Mi Boys' delicious and filling pork belly sandwiches. They have a fine balance of mouthwatering pork belly with carrots and veggies on a toasted Vietnamese bread. It's better than having a Subway sandwich every now and then.   The staff appear to be very diligent and work well as a team. But because this location has such a small kitchen (probably the size of a food truck), they can't possibly serve their customers any faster than they can. So unless you're willing to wait at least 40 minutes for your order, then best that you either visit during off-peak hours or don't go at all."}
{"text":"I liked this spot quite a bit.  It is basically vietnamese sandwich but with korean twist - the typical vietnamese meat is substituted with korean BBQ meat with option of adding kimchi.  I got the five spice pork and it was pretty good but slightly fatty and burnt - gave off good charcol flavor though.  Still I would give four star for uniqueness but not necessarily better than some of the best viet sub places which sell for $3-4 each.  So I need to deduct a star for being bit pricy.  I returned to try their kimchi fries and it was good.  Mayo, kimchi, pulled pork, green onion and fries just work.  I dont know why or how but the slightly sour kimchi w some shred of pulled pork (not fatty), with fries dotted w mayo goes down really well with a sip of coke and addictive.  I would prefer them to add more kimchi which was done perfectly.  It could also be a bit spicier."}
{"text":"Went there twice last week.... I think I'm a fan!!!  Great location, good menu (just enough options to wow you, not overwhelmingly), good drink options, decent service and most of all, love the twist of Viet/Chinese/Korean.... Just what we need in our city!!!  Must try items - beef cheek steam bao and grilled/pulled pork banh mi. Oh and the kimchi fries is a wanna-be poutine!! Worth trying, but c'mon now.... quand même!!!"}
{"text":"I really don't know why it took me so long to come here. Especially since I'm coming downtown for classes at Ryerson a couple of times a week and this place is very reasonably priced for a good portion of quality food! I had the bahn mi grilled pork with fries and it was yummy!  I definitely need to try the kimchi fries next time."}
{"text":"Had the Pulled Pork (Sandwich?) last week. One word: Amazing! When you order your food there for the first time you think to order two items off the menu because the menu is priced very low - totally not necessary! Great flavours, and well worth the price point!"}
{"text":"Had heard about Banh Mi Boys for the longest time but never had the time to go and try it out. I went during Friday for lunch and there were a lot of people in line but the service was efficient as orders kept coming out of the kitchen. I tried two steamed baos - the pork belly and chicken one. I was tempted to get the secret menu Club Bao but I thought I'd stick to the basics. Took my food to go since the store was too busy and seating was limited.   The baos are amazingly good. I would eat that huge slab of pork belly over and over again. Definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Kimchi fries (4/5): Good portion and delicious, though I prefer fries that are more crispy.   Baos (4/5): Really good, simple baos. Pork belly is my favourite.   Tacos (3/5): They're just alright. I wouldn't get them again.  The place is relatively small, the area to line up for food can get crowded. The menu is simple enough not to overwhelm you but still gives you an interesting variety. I love that their food is inexpensive."}
{"text":"It's totally worth all the hype! Thanks to all the reviews, we ordered the kimchi fries to share - which were amazing - and also got a sandwich each: pulled pork and braised beef cheek... the pork was better than the beef by a little, but both were really good.  It was all really delicious. but a sandwich and shared fries was too much food for me so next time we go back (there will be many next times) I think I will just get a taco or a bao!  Only down side... Wish there was just a TINY bit more seating!"}
{"text":"I go here when im craving for something quick and savory.  I usually share kim chi fries (a great mix of savory and sweet) and then order a bao on the side.  Again, most dishes are on the saltier side but still delicious"}
{"text":"TTTTT______________________TTTTT     It was the first time I had Banh Mi (I know, I'm not sure what I've been eating for the past 23 years) and it changed my life.  When I got my order (Grilled Pork Banh Mi) I was awed by the size of it for the price I paid. Then the aroma got to my nose as I walked to my seat and someone commented, \"Man, that looks SO good.\" My first bite was indescribable, but let me try my best here. The warm bun was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. The grilled pork had an excellent grill/smoky flavor and the texture was perfect (so crispy/chewy/crunchy I don't even know how to describe it). And the combination of it all with the carrots/cilantro/cucumbers on top.. it was just heaven in a bite. Thought I couldn't finish it when I looked at the size, but I enjoyed every single bite of my sandwich and left filling satisfied and not overly full.  I wish I had more time in Toronto to get this for every single meal."}
{"text":"Ii love the fried chicken bao sandwiches.  Crispy chicken and the fresh pickled toppings.  Its a great at $4 .  be prepared to wait in line for it.  They get really busy at lunch so go on off peak hours.   The pork belly is also really good."}
{"text":"I've always passed by this restaurant and never went in. Today was my first experience and taste here and it was great! Great prices and great tasting. I have heard it gets really busy during the week but we were lucky and got a seat. The grill chicken taco is amazing...ask for it spicy!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Banh Mi Boys several times and had just about everything on the menu. The Kalbi Beef Banh Mi is my personal favorite, but all of the Bahn Mi are all mighty tasty. The bao & tacos are great too. The Kimchi Fries are a MUST. Really, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  One thing to note is that everything is ordered to your personal spice level, so don't be worried about anything being too spicy or not spicy enough. I generally order hot (jalapenos), but occasionally super hot (habaneros) when I'm feeling ballsy.  My suggestion: read the menu, order what sounds best to you/you're in the mood for, add kimchi fries no matter how hungry or not you are, Enjoy.   DON'T FORGET THE KIMCHI FRIES!"}
{"text":"Great banh mi. The place is pretty packed and based on the reviews I think people frequently come here. Tried the grilled pork banhs and chose the Medium spicy version with a dash of sriracha. The pickled carrots are awesome. I would certainly be back for more banhs and sides."}
{"text":"I love Banh Mi Boys for so many reasons!! It's cheap, delicious, there's tons of options, the staff are friendly and the service is quick.  I've only been twice but everything I've ordered has been amazing. I LOVE that they use pickled vegetables as a topper, they're so delicious. I also love how they're super nice about me not liking cilantro and never forget to exclude it!  The steamed bao was probably my favourite thing. My friend who I brought last week said she wished she knew how good they were so she could have ordered a bunch! I have no idea what that bread is made of but it's UNREAL!  Can't wait to return! Perhaps for some kimchi fries?"}
{"text":"The fried chicken bao is amazing!  I also got the Kimchi fries but it wasn't as great - a bit soggy and I didn't like the pulled pork in it. Will definitely come back to try other items."}
{"text":"Busy little place for a good reason: the food is great, service if quick, and the prices are great value (sandwiches and tacos around $4-$6).  Only been here once, we shared the Kimchi and pulled pork fries and I have to say this was an awesome take on Poutine.  We also had 2 amazing tacos: beef and chicken, both tender and tasty!  D"}
{"text":"I had the pork belly bun. It was just A-Ok a bit on the dry side. Would be better if it was more tender and juicy.  The wait was around 15 minutes. A line up for some bread and pork for dry meat is not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"pretty good bahn mi and bao. got the 5 spice and it was very flavorful, but def not the best I've had. the size of the bao is huge. would only go again if it was close by. not worth going out of the way for. 3.5"}
{"text":"Seriously the best Vietnamese sandwiches in Toronto. They are very fresh, don't take too long to prepare, and amazing. Pretty cheap as well, good food in this city is becoming more and more expensive. The lineups look long, but really take very little time to get served. It is an amazing place to see how the cooks prepare the food, I have waited longer at Macdonalds for my food. I highly recommend this place, my favorite is the 5 spice pork belly."}
{"text":"Loved it! Came here with a friend and had the lemongrass tofu banh mi along with the sweet potato fries. Both were really well done and sweet potato fries are just the bomb diggity. I especially liked the very fast service...no idle chit chat like \"how's your day Akhil\" \"omg I love your sweater!\" Like c'mon Becky, I don't have time for that. And I don't even own any sweaters. But overall a nice place to just sit down  a usually with friends and have a fast, convinient, delicious meal. It can get busy at time so watch out for that."}
