{"text":"I tried their pho last year and thought it was good so I decided to come back today for a meal. This time I had beef fried rice, it was pretty average but expected. I also asked for a glass of water along side but I never got it! I wouldn't mind if the place was busy and she forgot about it but I was the only person there.  The bill came up to $7.90, I gave a 10 and received a toonie and a penny for change. I'm never coming back again."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch. Lunch specials are affordable and food had good flavour but I left hungry."}
{"text":"3.5*  I have passed by this place many times but never decided to try it until this past weekend. I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the Tofu satay with vermicelli noodles and my fiance ordered beef with vermicelli noodles. The lady taking our order did not speak very much english. She brought out an appetizer of fresh cold rolls that we did not order. But that was alright, they looked good so we decided to eat them anyway. My dish was good, they provided paper for the fresh rolls and hot water. Prices were reasonable and the food was fresh. I definitely would come back here. I would like to try other things on the menu since they have a lot to offer."}
{"text":"My wife and her family have been coming here for many years now, and now I'm hooked. If you like Vietnamese, you'll love this place.  What I regularly order is the beef vermicelli with spring rolls. The beef is well seasoned, and the handmade spring rolls provide the satisfying crunch to the meal.  Another thing I order, which isn't on the menu BTW, is the lemon chicken. It is amazing. Deep fried chicken pieces (don't worry, not the frozen crap) surrounded by a wonderfully gooey lemon/lime sauce. I get it with a side of noodles. Great on its own, or as a item to share with the table.   For drinks, I usually only have their green tea. Their iced coffee is good, as well as their mango milkshake.   Everything is well priced. The place is clean, service is prompt, and its never empty. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"You know this place is okay for the money. It's definitely not what I would call great Chinese. The menu is way too big for everything to be good so you are pretty much rolling the dice when you order. Some noodle dishes are ok, curry is terrible, spring rolls are okay. Price is awesome. You can get a ton of food for about 25 bucks."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times over the years I probably would come more often if i had more reasons to come in the area  But every time I've eaten here I've left satisfied. From the noodle dishes to the super spicy red coconut curry dishes i find them all well presented and appetizing. The service is fast and courteous and the price is right. This place is a classy place for people living on beer wages. Nice place to bring a date or a nice place to bring your Mom. She'll be impressed and tell her friends how nice it was  You owe yourself to check this place out!"}
{"text":"My actual rating is 3.5.  I went here the other day for a quick lunch with a colleague.  We both ordered off the lunch special menu.  We started with the wonton soup which was very sesame and enjoyable.  Next we had the grilled chicken bun with a spring roll.  Honestly, the spring roll was totally generic and not the type I associate with Pho places, but it was still crispy and passable.  And the serving of bun was generous though I noted the absence of some ingredients such as spring onions that help flavour this dish.    There was only one person running the show and it got busy.  Despite the fact that he had about six tables, some very large, he was VERY accommodating and as fast as he could be.  And then the bill... $6.99 for our lunch plus tax and tip?   Almost as cheap as a combo at Tim Hortons and undeniably much more pleasant.  I will return."}
{"text":"I know of a chain of Krispy Roll restaurants but this place is not part of the group. Because it's sooo much better.  Krispy Roll combines Vietnamese and Thai dishes -- none of that fusion crap, they just have Pad Thai and pho on the same menu. And they do them both really well.  I've only ever been there for lunch because their lunch specials are such a good deal -- pho, spring rolls and salad for $6 or noodles, spring rolls and soup for $8. So delicious and so cheap! You can't go wrong really. They also offer a veggie Pad Thai (does have egg in it though), with tons more vegetables than the standard Pad Thai with chicken/shrimp.  My only complaint is their hot and sour soup -- not really hot or sour, had way too much tofu in it and the broth tasted like salty water. I'd go for the wonton if you're getting the lunch special.  I guess they're used to the lunch rush (the place is usually pretty packed from 11:30-1:30), because the food comes really fast and service is amazingly efficient. Definitely worth checking out if you're ever in the area -- this place makes up for the lack of Thai places in Scarborough in a big way."}
