{"text":"First time here and really impressed with the pizza! I got the Diavalo with no meat and it exceeded my expectations. The crust is thin and buttery and the wood fire flavor is smoky and delightful! The ingredients were really fresh and I thought the pizza was well thought out with the garlic complimenting the spicy peppers and olives. The restaurant is small so plan ahead. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Went Saturday around 5:30 and the small dining area was already busy.  Luckily 2 couples left soon after we arrived and so we were able to sit down only after waiting a few minutes.  I think there are only 25 seats but the decor is comfy and hip.  The open kitchen fills the room with delicious smells.  Pies are baked in a round wood fired oven and the pizza is amazing.  Period."}
{"text":"We went to the beachland ballroom for a show. With time to kill we walked across the street to get a bite, just because it was there.  It was great, just what the doctor ordered.  Only thing I can say about the pizza is get here. Mushroom pizza was wonderful. Get here and enjoy."}
{"text":"Just got home from our first visit to Citizen Pie and we couldn't be happier! On the advice of the lady who checked my husband out, we pulled over and had a slice before getting home....DELICIOUS! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First off.  The best pizza in Cleveland.  It is real pizza.  I go there more than I like to admit.  I have tried 2pizzas and they are both drool worthy.  I have had the pepperoni and the mushroom.  The mushroom will change your life.  It is something that I dream about.  I almost don't like trying anything new once I get something good, but thus weekend my hubby and I went to get a pie.  Tried the Americano!!!!!! BEST PIZZA EVER!  I WILL HAVE IT ONCE A WEEK!  PLEASE GO AND TRY."}
{"text":"Really great wood fire pizza.   Really good. I would say best quality pizza in Cleveland!  Deluxe."}
{"text":"So for a first day,  I was surprised how tiny this place was but they had a nice stream of people in and out. The staff was super friendly and the spinach pie I had was everything I needed. It's dangerous that this place is on my way home from work!"}
{"text":"One of the best, if not the best, pizza joints in Cleveland.  Had the Collinwood Supreme and the Mushroom and both were great.  Definitely worth the trip from Ohio City."}
{"text":"Hand made pies from dough made with natural yeast starter makes for a delicious meal. The intimate space makes the 2 time customer feel like a regular. It's great to have good pizza in the heart of the east side of Cleveland."}
{"text":"The Pizza here is amazing get the Cacio E Pepe and add what ever you want. You won't be sorry"}
{"text":"Best classic, rustic-style pizza I've ever had. More often than not, I still (slightly) prefer a greasy, gut-busing, tastes-even-better-when-you-are-drunk thin crust pizza, but this is perfect. Seriously, this is as good as it gets (and it won't give you a stomach ache). If I'm not sitting on my couch, watching the Browns, eating pizza, and drinking beer -- than this is where I'd prefer to eat pizza!"}
{"text":"Citizen Pie = Amazing wood fired pizza. It's pretty small inside but that didn't stop a steady stream of pizza junkies from flowing in. The production flow was awesome, regardless of how many orders, they were timely. Our favorite was the mushroom white pizza, we added ricotta (highly recommended) and it was a creamy, cheesy delight on top of a crisp and chewy crust. Great stuff, we'll be back again."}
{"text":"I love the Mushroom Pie. It's so savory, the dough is perfect and they bake them perfectly bi also love the cheesecake."}
{"text":"GREAT little pizza place, fresh ingredients. Feels like you're at a friend's house to eat a pie. Only complaints are that they don't open earlier and my crust had *slightly* more burn than I prefer, very small issues. Would go back tomorrow if I could!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! We have tried the Little Italy, Margarita, and Mushroom pizzas. It's addicting. The mushroom pizza may be the best white sauce pizza we've ever eaten!! The ingredients are fresh, the crust is like Indian naan, and the service is fast. Forget what you think about or have previously experienced with pizzas and give this place a try! You will not regret it. Oh yeah...your pizza is cooked within a couple of minutes."}
{"text":"Great concept. Average pizza."}
{"text":"I want to love this place, but the dough is way too soggy....disappointing because I enjoy the fresh toppings and vibe of this place.    I had Citizen Pie multiple times already, but their dough is always really wet/soggy and needs to be a lot more firm.  Please correct the issues with the dough because I want to love this pizza!"}
{"text":"Best crust in town! The specials are ALWAYS worth that extra pizza! The pepperoni is insanely delicious and save some of the aforementioned crust to soak up the grease from cheese and 'roni The kids that work there were talented and attentive and even asked our 4 year old son what he thought of the pizza. He loved it and nearly devoured an entire margharita himself. Best pizza in this great city!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal - authentic Neopolitan pizza - and some of the best we've had in Cleveland.  We tried the Roman, the Mushroom and the Margherita. All stood out with a great char on the crust, a good amount of chew and flavors and toppings that did not overwhelm.  The combination of fresh jalepenos and Gaeta olives with the Burrata like cheese was amazing !!  Can't wait to go back.   For some of the Yelpers down below asking for more toppings or 'make your own pizza' - not sure they realize what authentic Neopolitan pizza is. I'd have them go to the Wikipedia entry at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_pizza."}
{"text":"Loved the pie!!! The large collage is an amazing piece of art! Will definitely be back! Great new place to try."}
{"text":"I just moved here from Georgia.  I am a pizza lover and have eaten at many good pizza shops.  This is one of the best ones on the list.  I enjoyed the casual atmosphere and friendly staff.  Will definitely return for more..."}
{"text":"yum! this place serves up excellent Neapolitan-style pizza with plenty of traditional and inventive (e. g. pistachio cream) toppings to please any pizza fan. a lot of their pies have meat, but can easily be made vegetarian and don't lose any flavor balance (according to my veggie dining partner). the wine they had on tap when I was in was great as well. will definitely be back, and want to leave more time to check out the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Takes 5 minutes to make, but tastes like it took a lifetime! Delicious, rich flavors and just plain yummy. Check out their specials for a treat!!"}
{"text":"Super location.  Cross the street and your at the Beachland!  Pizza reigns king at Citizen Pie.  No ups or extras just high quality pizza period.  Fresh ingredients, thin crust and wood oven baked.  Seating could be a problem, there are about 24 seats in the shop.  A couple of picnic tables out back would help.  Grab a beer and eat your pie..in and out in 30 minutes.  We would love an antipasto salad added to the menu.  Beachland+Citizen Pie=Great Night Out!"}
{"text":"Chef V is the guy behind some former Cleveland gems (Grovewood Tavern, and Americano). At some point during his Americano days he decided to immerse himself in the art of making perfect pizza. It was inevitable that he would open this restaurant specializing in authentic stone oven pizzas. Fortunately for the East Siders who he's spoiled over the years with his other culinary ventures, he decided to open Citizen Pie in the heart of the Waterloo Arts District in the North Shore Collinwood Neighborhood right across from the Beachland Ballroom.   His imported italian flour based dough recipe, and other meticulously selected high end ingredients result in a pizza that is one of the best thin crust pizzas you'll ever eat. I have eaten all of the pizzas on the menu, along with a number of specialty pizzas and desserts. It's all great food.   I almost exclusively order takeout because the place is small. And I order a couple pizzas because I love making leftover pizza and eggs the next day for breakfast.   The prices are only slightly higher than most other joints charge for pizzas the same size, but the quality of these pizzas is hard to beat. The only other places in town with thin crust pizzas that come close are Crostata's in Highland Hts., and Bucci's in Middleburg Hts.   Also it's kind of weird to see images of Communist leaders on an art installation inside the restaurant, and the left wing \"raised fist\" symbol acting as the restaurant's logo considering Chef V - being an immigrant from Eastern Europe - likely has a number of tales of the horrors of Communist Russia, but I have to assume he left the decorating up to one of the local lefty artist types. Oops!"}
{"text":"Recently ate at Citizen Pie.  This is without question the best pizza in Ohio.  As good as any pizza I can recall eating anywhere.  The menu is creative and the crust/dough in their over comes out perfectly.  We had the Americano.  Great choice and inventive flavor combinations.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have tried MANY pizzas from all over! Eating this pizza makes you feel like you are in Italy eating a freshly made traditional pizza. The first bite I took I literally had an orgasim  in my mouth. Excuse my language but it was that good!!  There aren't many places to get true Italian pizzas around here. My partner and I literAlly got 4 pizzas in one day from there. We went for lunch and then went for dinner because we couldn't get enough!!! My suggestion would be to not get it to go because it's that type of pizza that you want to devour right when it's out of that big expensive oven of theirs!! Hey by the way if you are vegan the marinara could be made vegan!! I also suggest you ordering the exact pizzas listed without adding ingredients. They made it so each pizza has a specific taste and by adding different ingredients it takes away from the purpose!! Support this place because they use fresh organic ingredients and use flour that is not bleached!! So if you are trying to figure out dinner tonight you know where to go!!! Thanks citizen's pie for making such amazing pie! Our pockets are becoming empty because of how many pizzas we buy"}
{"text":"Finally got to try citizen pie! Every time I attempt to get pizza they are out of dough! It was hopping as I left the restaurant. Prices are a bit pricey but well worth it! Though, I have to say I hate the box of water they offer."}
{"text":"Superb service. My pie had an exciting blend of flavor & spices. Thoroughly enjoyed my meal!"}
{"text":"Stopped through earlier today after setting up for a show across the street. Pizza is amazing! Ready to go in less than 5 minutes and made from scratch in front of you. Highly recommend this place! I'll definitely be a repeat customer when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"We go to this place pretty often and always had a great experience until now. The girl at the register couldn't keep anyone's orders straight and was consistently giving the wrong orders to the wrong people. I ordered 2 pizzas with my boyfriend  and of course she gave one of them to the wrong person so I got to sit and watch my boyfriend eat while mine was being remade. It was remade wrong so I had to wait even longer. By the time mine my finally came out my boyfriend was finished and he got to watch me. Fun! **** update **** the owner reached out and rectified the situation. We returned this evening for dinner and it was amazing. Thank you Citizen Pie for making it right and keeping us coming back! :)"}
{"text":"I loved their story: An immigrant from communist Lithuania learns about pizza in Naples and opens his own shop in North Collinwood.  Friendly staff. Quality ingredients. 1,000 degree wood burning oven. All good. We ordered three very different pizzas. The problem I had was with the bottom crust: not crisp but limp and soggy. I thought that we may have ordered too many toppings but the crust on the simple margherita was the same.  The bottom crust was so limp even a small slice couldn't be picked up and toppings slid off."}
{"text":"Nicely done true pizza. Combos are great. Red sauce is perfect. People should realize this pizza is best when eaten straight out of the oven. I'd like to see the crust just a little more done but this isn't enough of a problem to lower my review. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"As I said on Facebook, I got a pie to take home and only half made it to my door because I needed to eat it RIGHT AWAY. This place has everything going for it. Friendly staff, delicious pizza (I'd say top five for sure in CLE if not higher) and a cool location. Wish I lived closer, but I work about five minutes away so that works for me!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype-- this is one of the best pizzas in Cleveland.  Chef V is exacting about the quality of his pies and ingredients, and it shows in every bite.    The sourdough is made daily from scratch-- only flour, yeast, salt, and water.  The ingredients are carefully chosen and paired well on the various pizzas on the menu.  Pizzas are stretched, topped, and flash-baked in a custom wood-fired oven right in front of you.    The result of all this care and attention to detail is a pie that is thin and somehow crispy and chewy at the same time.  Whether you try a simple margherita or one of the more complicated pies, the flavors all balance and come together for a little pizzagasm in your mouth.   I've had Neapolitan pizza in Naples, and this is better than the best I tasted there.    The pies themselves are about 12 inches and pretty thin, so plan on about one pizza per person.  The best way to do it?  Bring a few friends, order a bunch of different pies, and share them all.  Also, as noted in other reviews, these pizzas are best eaten right out of the oven.  They do carry out but they're really made to be eaten on site.  It's like getting a croissant fresh and flaky from the oven.  Sure, you can eat them later, but it's not the same experience.  I've brought a few people here and everyone loved it and wants to come back for more.  I've tried about half the pies so far, and my favorite is the Caceo E Pepe.  If there's an ingredient you don't like, they can leave it off.  But I'd recommend not trying to add your own ingredients.  These are gourmet pies and every one I've tried has been a great blend of flavors.  Save the build-your-own for Papa Johns.  ;)  As if the food wasn't enough, Chef V and his tiny staff are friendly and fun to talk to.  They really seem to enjoy running the pizza place and talking with customers.  This is a small space with communal seating-- maybe 15 seats total.  The pies cook quick so you'll probably be in and out in under an hour.  Have fun, talk to your neighbors, and then maybe check out some of the great galleries and bars in the Waterloo district."}
{"text":"Truly great pizza. The location is great if you are going to the Beachland Ballroom. The wine on tap is interesting (as are the Italian Wedding glasses). Nice people work there."}
{"text":"Good food. Good music. Good atmosphere. 5/5  The pizza is some of my favorite and would go here for real pizza any day.  The workers are so friendly and inviting. They've always got amazing music playing too.  Great artwork on the walls.  Absolutely love it."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, with really great ingredients, kind of a weird experience but could have been an off day. I've been wanting to try here for forever. Stopped in and order a cacio e pepe pizza to go. When I went to pay (via square which I'm used to), the comment was made \"a tip would be nice\". Yeah bro I got you, don't worry, but thanks for the suggestion. Pizza came out super fast, which I was thankful for because the wait was rather awkward. No one makes an attempt to make you feel welcome, or even engaged in general small talk. I'd come back in a second for that tasty crust, but I guess I'd expect the snotty attitude next time."}
{"text":"Solid pizza in a very small store front.  The pepperoni is among the best I've ever had.  The crust is unique in that it reminds me of sour dough.  I really liked it.   Calzone was a little heavy on the ricotta for my taste.    Tight spot so plan to share space.   Was still worth the 30 min drive for us."}
{"text":"Simply fantastic. Perfect Neapolitan style pizza. High quality and fresh ingredients. Unbelievable dough and crust. Very high end wood burning pizza oven. Meets strictest Neapolitan standards. As good as Neapolitan pizza gets."}
{"text":"Citizen Pie is awesome! I walked in and out with my pizzas in about 7-10 minutes. Such good service and they are very friendly. The oven is super cool and it cooks so quickly! The pizza is AHMAZING. It's exactly like the pizza in Europe that I'm always craving, but can never find here.   I will definitely be here more often!! A+!!"}
{"text":"Great pies and laid back atmosphere. Glad we chose it today. I can't wait to come back and try anything with that spicy honey!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza Period! Organic dough, freshly made, wood-fired oven. The owner strives for quality in every aspect. From the sea salt to the Spanish anchovies, this place is, bar none, the most amazing pizza I have ever eaten. My favorite is the Puttanesca, followed by a threeway tie between the Porcini mushroom, Pistachio cream Americano, and the Eggplant-basil-pinenut Caponata. Then comes the delicious Roman with stracciatella (sp?) and the Spanish with chorizo. Although the Margherita is a staple and you must try the Verde, their Pesto is the best. The olives and chiles are exclusive. It is their ingredients that really blow me away. Quality that leaves you with an insatiable urge for more! This is one of the few places I go out to eat when I am in Cleveland :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland, hands down.  I have tried 6 so far, the mushroom was the best, but they were all good.  Props."}
{"text":"Legit with no gimmicks. Small place and I really liked how the guys making the pizzas are also the ones getting you your beers or wine. I see good things happening with this spot for a long time. 90 second pizzas, seriously."}
{"text":"Just like its counterpart in Waterloo, Citizen Pie serves up what I consider to be the best-tasting artisanal Pizza in CLE.  You cannot beat the chewy dough, high quality cheese and thick smoked pepperoni.  Yes it is much more spendy than regular pizza places but folks you are paying for quality.  Pizza is made fresh when you order.  Grab a seat at the counter but only do so after walking up and placing your order."}
{"text":"Duuuuuuuuuuuude  This might be the best pizza in CLE.   No joke.   The crust is chewy deliciousness.   Sauce,  cheese,  pepperoni all on point and high quality.   The pizza bakes in about 2 or 3 minutes.   There are a few seats inside at a bar that allows you watch them hand stretch and top your pie before it goes into the oven.   Cool music plays overhead.   Hip staff.   Damn that crust rocks my world.  Good schtuff... I just wish they would put more sauce on the pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizzas- had the Diavolo & the Roman- both excellent. Fresh, tasty ingredients and pizzas take under 90 seconds to make. Only down side was the price ($15-$17 per personal size pizza). But overall great food & service."}
{"text":"This place is the best pizza in Cleveland.. probably even Ohio. The pizza is so good that I would eat it every day if I could afford it.. yes it's pricy but i rather eat pizza once a week but good pizza instead of dominos nasty pizza.   Up to you but this is my number one choice for pizza.   They also got a new location in ohio city but I havent been there to eat."}
{"text":"The best pizza and staff around. A true pizza lover experience. When in Waterloo you must stop here!"}
{"text":"Citizen Pie is the FASTEST pizza you'll get, and delicious, too! There's plenty of varieties to try, including red and white sauce pizza. I prefer the calzones, but during my trip here I had to ask them to reheat mine because the mozzarella wasn't even melted... calzone was lukewarm. They immediately put it back into the oven for a while, and all was good! Wine and beer options are also available here, including a good Burgkopf Pilsner."}
{"text":"This place is the truth. Pizza is amazing, but the people really seal the deal. Don't change anything, guys."}
{"text":"Overall Very good. Only needed to be baked one more minute. Surrounding diners said same so maybe it was the person baking tonight. Great great taste. A couple bucks higher than should be. Pie is More than enough for one person but not enough for 2 people. Very casual. No outside seating. Takes 10-15 minutes after you order and that was with the place full."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, yes! We were fans of this pizza shop on the east side, but this store opening on W.25th is the bees knees!   My husband and I stopped in to try the cacio e pepe pie last night and it was just phenomenal. Crust was chewy and light. The cheese was sort and creamy. The hint of black pepper was perfect. Loved it!   The staff was also awesome! Very hard working and friendly. I will recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Perfectly chewy crust with light char. Toppings and sauces are top quality and really shine through. One of the best pizza margherita I've had. Only thing I'd change is maybe a bit more basil. Delicious."}
{"text":"Pizza in a few minutes, how do you pass that up? You don't, especially when it's made so good. I liked how they did sausage slices instead of crumbles. Probably can't go wrong with your pizza choice, so go with whatever you like... and maybe try something new."}
{"text":"Woodfired Pizza was delicious - crust was amazing with the perfect combination of chewy and crispy. We chose the special of the day and loved it - one pizza was enough food for two adults. Good selection of wine on tap and bottled beer in the cooler. Enjoyed sitting at the counter and watching them make the pies."}
{"text":"This little, home style pizzeria is just across from the Beachland Ballroom, and serves everything from the standard pepperoni and cheese to exotic pizzas with more eclectic ingredients. We love to stop off before a show at the Beachland and indulge in a little snack. The prices are moderate, and there's no parking save on the street for this gem, but it's worth it to stop off especially before a show. So, Citizen,my suggestion, stop of for a bit and relax if you're in the neighborhood and enjoy a pizza pie made just for you:)"}
{"text":"This the best pizza!  They use only the finest ingredients and take time to come up with create the perfect pizza. It's a really cute, clean and friendly place. I love all but often crave the mushroom and brie pizza. They have great pizza specials too."}
{"text":"I have been to Citizen Pie twice and it was fabulous both times. I have tried the magherita, cacio e pepe, roman and collinwood. The stracciatella is to DIE for, so the next time I make it out there I will be sure to order something with stracciatella. On top of amazing pizza, they also have a good drink selection. I love the cozy feel, but I wish it could seat more people."}
{"text":"Good food but expensive for what it is... I like it when I am in the neighborhood which is often but it is only okay for the money and quantity."}
{"text":"In love with their pies and always have the hardest time choosing between their amazing flavor combos! Can't wait for their Ohio City location to open up!"}
{"text":"This is the Whole Foods of pizza. Their fresh ingredients and homemade dough (no preservatives)  is second to none. Although their pizza is on the pricy side  ($14 for a personal pie), you would be cheating yourself not to try it. I struggled not getting one to go. Great service and even better pizza!"}
{"text":"Incredible Neapolitan pizza in The CLE.   The chef and staff take this pizza business seriously and it shows in everything from the tomato sauce and toppings they use to the mind-blowing, naturally fermented dough they lovingly make each day for the crust. The tang and char of the crust rival and even surpass much of the pizza I had in Naples when on a pizza expedition. We are fortunate to have Citizen Pie in Cleveland."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in the door, I let out a big, happy sigh of relief. It was immediately warm and cozy from the heat of the pizza oven. I felt at home. A great refuge from the cold to hang out at before heading over to the Beachland ballroom for a show.    A local beer was in my hand in no time and the Cacio E Pepe pizza was ordered. Mozz, Pecorino, Stracciatella, garlic & black pepper. The dough and crust and everything about it was amazing! Mamma Mia! We ordered a Collinwood pie next and damn, son! Mozz, salami, It sausage, Cali olive, fresh green chilies and red onion all baked to perfection.  The staff was cool, the bathrooms were clean,  the ambiance was great, complete with a neat soundtrack. Glad to have discovered this pie joint. Soooo tasty! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Not worth it all! Paid $17 for the Margarita pizza with sausage. There was absolutely no one else in there during lunch and it turned out terrible. As soon as i grabbed a slice all the toppings slid off. Tried waiting for it to cool down still the same thing. Gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the dough/crust is delicious l.. considering that's all I'm really eating..Soggy, slimy and just not the quality I was expecting.. very disappointed"}
{"text":"The name alone evokes a lasting image of a radical theme from the turbulent 60s, and the walls are laden with pictures of some of the most evocative figures in history (e.g., Fidel Castro, Albert Einstein, Che Guevera). But as you sit down and stare curiously at the 900 degree brick oven, it is then that you realize the     effort that the owners put into this pizza establishment.  Most pizzas range in price from $13-$15 a pie and are ready in less than a minute ( I timed mine at 46 seconds) once they are fed into the scorching chamber of the oven.  The crust is slightly charred but not crunchy, it has a nice chewiness to it and is thin.  Because the pizzas here are authentic Napolitano style, they are only one size, yet large enough to satisfy the appetite of most adult men.  The hours also vary, because they operate until the dough runs out, at which point a sign is posted on the front door.  Overall, the pizza is spectacular and warrants a 5 star rating.  No frills, gimmicks, or cheesy (no pun intended) sales pitches - just phenomenal pizza that is worthy of endless praise."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had since being in Italy... Great food and awesome staff. Great hang in the restaurant as well. Will be going here probably way too often."}
{"text":"Kudos to Cleveland for having not one but at least two genuine Pizza Napoletana pizzerias.  The criteria are pretty strict (very high oven temp, \"OO\" flour, hand tossing, etc.) and Citizen Pie (and Vero Pizza in Cleveland Heights) have stepped up to the challenge.  The pies here were excellent with crispy bottoms and accompanying toppings.  We had the Margarita, Smoked Pepperoni, and mushroom pies.  The first two were on the mark.  The mushroom suffered from being a bit too watery causing the crust to get pretty soggy. You need to look past the pretentious \"Cane Sugar Coke\" and \"we only serve bottled water\" nonsense and focus on the pies.  And you're not going to get the same mileage from your dollars here--the pies are top notch and priced to reflect that."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic and smartly sourced ingredients - our pies were very yummy! Though housed in a small space I hope to dine-in sometime. A wonderful addition to the Waterloo Art District!"}
{"text":"Using the word great to describe this pizza would be an understatement! Best of all it comes out faster than any fast food joint so long as it's not crowded. Much needed addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! A must stop by if you're in Collinwood area. Try the Divola...it's the best!"}
{"text":"The pizza was wonderful---delicious wood-oven pizza.  There are a variety of toppings and you get to watch them prepare your pizza.  The prices seem reasonable, given the quality of what you get.  As others mention, they only have bottles of water (for sale), no tap.  I found this a little unexpected, but not a deal breaker.  I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Overall the experience was good. The pizza was tasty and the service was friendly and quick. For a neapolitan style pizza I was not blown away as with other reviewers. I just consider the pizza as good. Price was not over the top for the quality of preparation and ingredients. Everything seemed fresh, which in my book is a definite plus. One reviewer complained that the center of the pizza seemed thin/overcooked. After eating the pizza here I understand what the review was describing; however that is what neapolitan style pizza is really like. After enjoying this style pizza throughout Europe I can attest this is how neapolitan pizza is. Location is in the Waterloo Art District across from Beachland Tavern, which puts it at prime location to cater to the music scene. I would recommend Citizen Pie if you are in the vicinity, but I will not make a trip just to get a pie."}
{"text":"Holy crap!  What a delicious pizza.  I'm admittedly biased toward this style pizza, but it was absolutely amazing.   Great, fresh ingredients.  I probably could've eaten 2 whole pies myself, but my wallet wouldn't let me.  I just wish I could've gotten a cup of water to go with it while I ate there."}
{"text":"Very, very good pizza in a very, very cramped storefront. Go for their delicious pizzas, but don't expect much else as far as a 'complete' dining experience is concerned. Drinks are from a can or bottle (no ice or glasses) and you may be seated at a fairly slim counter with not much room for you or your food. For those reasons, it's  not worth the drive for me unless I'm already in the neighborhood for something else. The 4 stars are for the killer pies only."}
{"text":"Best wood fired pizza you'll find in Cleveland.  We went with the Calabrese and would definitely recommend it - the peppers they add to it our spicy, but they're not overpowering.   Only takes about 5 minutes for them to prep and cook your pizza so it's a quick place to stop in to. There are seats inside, although not many. You can sit right at the bar and watch as they're preparing the pizzas."}
{"text":"Excellent stone oven pizza.  Crust is on the thin side, but fresh ingredients and unique combinations.  Nothing really on the menu but pizza and dining get room is very small.  Biggest complaint is that it's a little over priced but the pizza is very good."}
{"text":"I had the Putanesca and Funghi. Clearly they care about the sourcing of everything down to the imported flour from Italy to make the crust. It's a small crowded place, but I didn't mind at all. Looks like they're trying to get a liquor license, but for now BYOB."}
{"text":"Plenty of parking. Easy access from I-90. Quick service. Wine on tap. Amazing flavors. Tasty pizza. Need I say more?!"}
{"text":"Naples style pizza in Cleveland!  If you can't afford to go to Naples or Rome...as in the words of Dean Martin...as in Rome do what the Romans do... have a true Italian pizza!  The slices may flop, but if you fold that part then Mama Mia... you'll be saying delizioso!"}
{"text":"We've been anticipating Citizen Pie's opening and were so pleased when we visited. Friendly service. Wonderful pizza.  When it comes to Neapolitan pizza, I have a hard time ordering anything other than Margherita, but we also ordered a Puttanesca, and a Spinach Pie and would order each again!   The space is cozy and glowy, and a great spot to stop on a cold night. There is not a ton of seating inside, so you may have some neighbors at your table, which is great because the world needs more neighbors at tables.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I am SO happy we have a Citizen Pie location in Ohio City.  Their pizza is delicious, made to order with high quality ingredients, friendly and welcoming staffing.  Very welcome addition."}
{"text":"Small, casual spot where you sit where you can and clear your own dishes.  The Neopolitan-style pizzas (just the right size to split between two) come out blindingly fast and topped with good-quality, fresh ingredients.  The crust manages to maintain a degree of chewiness despite its leopard-spotting, though I would have preferred something a little bit crispier.  (Their menu is adamant that you can't request a \"well done\" pizza, which I can understand as a matter of quality control.)  Like other Neapolitan pizza spots, I recommend eating the pizza fairly fast as it cools off quickly.  On pizza alone I still prefer Vero Bistro, and 3 Palms would be a pretty competitive option as well.   Still, Citizen Pie is well worth a visit, even for a trek across town."}
{"text":"Finally made it back to this place and I have to update my review.   They have air conditioning and a self-serve water station now!! Staff is still pleasant, pizza still tasty, and still a good spot before shows at Beachland.   This time we tried Caico de Pepe and the Little Italy, the former was my favorite. Yum!   A question to them is, would you ever consider making a s'mores pizza?"}
{"text":"The Roman. I CANNOT get anything else here. Which is not fair to the other pies. Thanks to the black haired female pizza artist that recommended 2 other great pizzas. One of these days I will try your recommendations. It's your fault the ROMAN is so damn good though. I heart Citizen Pie."}
{"text":"3.5 stars (I wish Yelp would give us half-stars already). Citizen Pie is a fine pizza place. They use a wood fired oven to prepare your \"personal\" pizza (although I would say two could share one pie) with fresh ingredients.   As a general rule when trying a new pizza place on my own I try to stick with just cheese, and MAYBE pepperoni, because I want to understand the base pizza they're starting from. In this case I ordered both; one cheese and one pepperoni (shared with a friend with the same view as my own). The crust was chewy and flavorful; my personal favorite part of the experience. Lacking for me was the sauce and the cheese. Nothing terrible, just sorta there. Service and cleanliness receive high marks, and the price was reasonable.   I will definitely return to Citizen Pie in the near future, and venture further into their various pizza offerings. But on a baseline level, I would say that their pizza is just above average. Not the best I've ever had, but clearly not the worst either."}
{"text":"I went back to Citizen Pie at the invitation of one of the owners who reached out to me to discuss what they do.  I appreciate people who take pride in what they do so I felt I had to give  them another chance.  So I headed over to the Collinwood neighborhood which is the next area in Cleveland that is on the upswing.  No problem with parking during the day, but I'm sure it can be a bit harder when there are events at the Beachland Ballroom.  Went with the Margarita pie again, although this time I added on the mushroom slices and I have to say that my experience was near perfect.  Where the first time I admired the individual quality ingredients they never seemed to come together; this time the pie was perfectly cooked and the result was amazing.  With any pizza you want the crust, sauce and cheese to come together to make a whole that is greater then the sum of its parts and that is exactly what happened.  When you get this alchemy your taste buds sing.    This time the crust was tasty all the way across; with the center still a bit saggy, but that was explained to me as part of the style.  The sauce had just the right level of sweetness to set off the saltiness of the cheese and the meaty flavor of the portobello slices.  With pizza such as this the secret is the simplicity of using high quality ingredients and letting the true flavors come through.    If you are looking for some high quality Neapolitan Pizza you have to check out Citizen Pie; it is the type of place that you will have strong feelings about one way or the other."}
{"text":"Picked up carryout from here last Thursday and as good as Waterloo location with more space. Readers, this is hands down the best pizza in CLE. The Ohio City location has a couple different pizza offerings than Waterloo. Great vibe and chill."}
{"text":"Overdue review here. I've picked up Citizens Pie 1-2 times weekly for the last 3 months :) it's that good. No need to call on the way as it literally takes 90 seconds in the oven. Good golly so amazing you cannot go wrong on any of the pizza's; the meats are from next door, pesto amazing, pistachio creme with italian sausage? yes! This works and you'll be coming back for more.  Last week I really wanted to try the Pesto Animal but love their sausage and not a soppressata fan. I was afraid to ask if they would substitute from reading one of the earlier Yelp reviews...However I asked, they said no problem! and this pizza was amazing!!  Here's a tip - order their mushroom pizza and drizzle truffle oil on the crust . That will take the pizza to 3 levels above and tastes great next day as well.  Run, don't walk to Citizens Pie!"}
{"text":"My only question is Why didn't I try this place sooner? This is the best pizza in the Land to date that I've had. The crust is chewy and delicious, not too thin and not too thick. It has the perfect proportion of dough and toppings. One doesn't overwhelm each other, they are in sync.  They have a great menu of red and white pizzas. I'm more of a white pizza girl with lots of cheese. I chose the Cacio E Pepe. Wow. Just Wow. Mozzarella cheese Black pepper and that stracciatella cheese, creamy and delicious. It was my first time here so I wanted to start with something basic and this pizza fit the bill. I will definitely be back to try other items. Their Mushroom pizza sounds to die for with mozzarella Brie bacon onion and truffle oil. Gosh do I love truffle oil!! This location is rather small. They have a bar countertop where you can sit and watch them make your pizza. There is s larger table that seats about 6. There are also countertops facing the road where you can sit and people watch. I went on a Sunday afternoon and it was a dead street so nothing to see. Just me to sit and dwell in my delicious pizza. There are nonalcoholic and alcoholic drinks for purchase as well as desserts. I wish they offered salads or some side item as this is how I like to eat my pizza but that's just me. NBD  Pizzas are on the expensive side but the quality is worth it. And you get it super quick! Like less than 5 minutes fast! I had plenty of leftovers and I dove into another slice on my long drive back home. This place is worth the drive as I have no other pizza place like this by me. I will be back. Get yourself here!!"}
{"text":"I am Italian and I think that this is the only pizza shop in Cleveland that makes a real Italian pizza. I love it."}
{"text":"This place is fast and casual and your pizza only cooks for 90 seconds which is ideal if you're as  incredibly impatient as I am. (I just get super excited to eat great food, I'm sure you know the feeling!!) I got the Margherita pizza and it was pretty good, wish it had more flavor in the crust though. I think the biggest thing I didn't love was how small the place is. There is a line for seats but nowhere for that line to exist really. I definitely don't think this pizza is as good as In Forno in Avon, but if you're an Eastsider trying to save an hour in commute, Citizen Pie will fill that Neapolitan pizza sized whole we all have inside."}
{"text":"A great Neapolitan pizza in a great location! It's fast, it's delicious, I definitely ate way more pizza than I was anticipating and it was amazing. I love Waterloo and the local art scene there! Citizen is small like so so small and it's always PACKED, but they churn out pizzas like wild fire! (It's actually wood fired ). I've tried both the Margherita (which is my go to for a new pizza place-gotta try to be consistent) and the pesto one. They're both really good! This is the perfect pre-Beachland tavern or pre-Walk all over Waterloo stop. They often (OFTEN) close early because they run out of dough so don't dawdle. Citizen Pie is cooking up something special over here!"}
{"text":"Snowy day in Cleveland and of course the perfect meal to go along with that would be pizza! I read about this place in a local magazine so gave it a go. This place isn't that big so I imagine on a busy night there where be no where to sit but over all I'd say the pizza is worth the wait. (Or stand) . Ordered one regular pepperoni pizza which was pretty good in my opinion. The pepperoni itself was great as well. Also I ordered a puttanesca which was good as well however it was a bit salty. The sauce works well with the dough and ingredients. If I'm in the area I'd give this place a try again."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. I went for the first time today with my boyfriend and I had a pepperoni pizza. It's cooked in a brick oven with organic ingredients. The restaurant is cozy and has cool decorations. I would totally recommend it."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about Citizen Pie. It's fast. It's fresh. It's worth the price. The crust was so light and fluffy that I felt as if I was eating a cloud from the heavens themselves. I got a calzone which was as big as my head. And delicious. The staff were great too. Everything about this place is great and I am so pumped it exists in Ohio City now."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I was wandering around Waterloo district taking pictures and needed something to eat when I stumbled upon citizen pie. I had heard about it through friends. The pizza was incredible the dough was so light and perfect the cheese and sauce was just enough everything was perfect."}
{"text":"August '16, visited Cleveland. I know, I know. Who just goes to CLE? Well, I went to see MGK, 216's very own.  I came across Citizen's Pie after searching for 'Cacio e Pepe' - random craving. Don't judge me. Cacio e Pepe is a traditional Italian dish made with spaghetti, olive oil, pepper, and pecorino romano cheese. Cacio e Pepe literally translates to \"cheese and pepper.\" I was intrigued when I saw CP's menu had a Cacio e Pepe pizza. I had a few hours to kill before flight departed, so my friend and I headed to CP. We found parking on a side street. Ngl, I was a little afraid to leave our rental car on street because area looked rough. But everyone on street said hello and patrons were all friendly too! I would say CP is a diamond in the rough, but that's dismissive to the surrounding community that thrived and existed before this hipster pizza place opened. ;)  The place is small, but very clean! Like I said, totally hipster - with colorful art adorning wall. (I could see this place doing well in LA or San Fran.) I was surprised by quality of ingredients and flavor of both pizza's we ordered. We had the cacio e pepe and margherita pizza with a Mexican coke. Both so, so, so good. Crust was my favorite part of the pizza - it had the perfect amount of crunch.  Service was excellent.   Citizen's Pie was the perfect ending to a great trip."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza I've ever tasted! Claudia and staff are friendly and the quality of food is top notch"}
{"text":"This was such a great find on my cross country road trip-close to the highway and with lots of delicious vegetarian options.  The service was fast and the pizza was really excellent with dough that was thick but not too thick, and an array of flavorful Sauces and fresh toppings."}
{"text":"PIZZA!! Oh my goodness, if you're craving pizza and have and are an adventurous eater. I highly recommend this place.  Sure, you could get a regular pizza. But, why? When you can get a Bologna pizza, or a Mushroom pizza made with truffle oil or better yet, an Anchovy pizza and all of this is on a thin pizza crust.   Man, this place was off the hook. We of course went in and it was packed. Asked the lady behind the counter for her recommendations and she recommended the mushroom pizza. Which is hands down the best damn pizza I've ever put in my face. I was hesitant at first, but now? Now, I'm a true mushroom pizza lover. The mixture of mushrooms, garlic, truffle oil and fresh mozzarella was really something incredible!   The special was the Bologna pizza. It wasn't my favorite. But, it was different. I really enjoyed the spicy honey drizzled on top.  We took a pizza to go. It was loaded with Anchovies, olives, red sauce, fresh mozzarella, and spicy sausage. It was super tasty.   Prices were a bit steep, but you get what you pair for. Beer list wasn't that great. But, I didn't go for the beer, I went for the pizza.  Staff was wicked awesome and the restaurant itself was clean and welcoming.   Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this place and hope to make it my place to stop every time I am in the area.  We found them using yelp and it was well worth the detour on our tip back home. The place is small but explosive with flavor! I called ahead thinking they would be a large establishment but thankfully they are small and a neighborhood type place. Makes me wish they were in my neighborhood!  The wood fired oven is fantastic and to quote and confirm, it really does only take 90-120 second to make a pie! The dough was chewy and crispy. It was delightful!  They buy the highest gluten wheat flour they can and add nothing to it. Its unbleached and again its fantastic!  The have a great deal of special pies and of course you can have one made to order."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in the Land. White sauce or red, it doesn't matter. Don't be suprised if after finishing one, you'll be in the mood for for a second or third.  Any pie with the stratiatella on it is going to be amazing. Cacio y pepe is where it's at. Diavolo and Putanesca do well if you like a little heat. While those pizzas with bacon tend to be dominated by that smokey flavor, I wouldn't complain because it speaks to the quality - just diversify your order.   They will make your order to go and the place can be a little crowded, but the pizza travels okay and if you get home and the crust isn't quite as crispy, just know the flavors have soaked in a little deeper."}
{"text":"I have been curious about this place for months and finally my husband and I got a chance to stop by this evening. We ordered the Collinwood pizza ($16) and love it. It was thin crust and the ingredients all taste fresh. This place is small, clean  and pretty laid back. It has  interesting  collage display of historical figures and arts on one of the walls. Service was quick and they provided cold water if you don't want to order sodas or beers. We'll definitely come back to try other pizzas from their menu."}
{"text":"Pizza was spectacular, certainly in the top 3 pies I've tasted in Cleveland. Sat at the bar, which overlooks the area where the pizzas are made and talked to the very friendly owner while he threw together one delicious looking pizza after another. They are serious about using the best ingredients and their pizza oven is something to behold. This is a pretty small place, so seating felt a little limited, but I would go back many times even if I had to eat this pizza standing on one leg."}
{"text":"Revisited Citizen Pie after months. I removed my earlier post because I wanted to do this this place justice. The owner reached out to me after my original post (unheard of lol) and I truly think she cared about my first experience and even offered me a free pie ( we ordered 2 with drinks today). The Pizza was Delish and the service impeccable. People were greeted as they entered and left by the staff. The place was clean too! We asked for Arvid and he took good care of us! Bonn and the other young girls (I didn't get their names) were also quite attentive to the customers. Arvid checked on us several times! 5 stars today Claudia!"}
{"text":"Still searching for the best pizza in the Cleveland area. Citizen Pie has the 900 degree wood fired oven which is a dream if paired with the perfect dough and sauce. Their dough is almost perfect. The edges are amazing but the center is a bit too thin making the pizza a bit soggy. The sauce is a basic marinara with no spices or flavor outside of the tomato. A nice classic sauce but the amount of water in it sogs up the dough. Prices are a tad on the high side, but overall we had a good experience. Plenty of parking nearby, nice interior and staff. Extremely clean, not too busy. I like that they make everything right in front of you. I'd come back just not sure I'd crave it."}
{"text":"As you enter this pizzeria, senses awaken. Naturally fermented dough, the warmth of wood burning from a clay oven and a mural on one wall --of revolutionary types-- a riot of pattern and color. From the moment I walked though the doors, I knew I was in for a treat. Clearly, this is an operation that takes itself and its product seriously.   On a recent visit, I ordered the Roman-- red sauce base with burrata, smoked mozzarella, gaeta olives and green chiles. The heat from the chiles and the saltiness of the olives balanced well with the cream of the burrata. The dough, neither overly dense or too thin was much more than a device to deliver cheese and toppings to face. While the toppings were clearly a thing of beauty, the star of the show was evident. The dough, cooked to perfection under the direction of a well practiced craftsman was unlike anything else in the city. The chew, the texture, the seasoning were all exceptional. The Vegetable Calzone, consisting of ricotta, mozzarella, spinach, roasted peppers, eggplant and gaeta olives didn't disappoint either. A pillowy pocket of creamy cheese and vegetables that were cooked properly to al dente. As I ate, a scary blissed-out expression flashed across my face.  The care and precision in the making of pizza seems to be a thing of great passion shared between the owners and chef. The otherworldly results of this very focused menu of pizzas and calzones are evidence."}
{"text":"They only had dough for a couple pizzas when we arrived close to 9:00 PM.  Which can only mean that the dough is going to be fresh and delicious! Ordered the Americano at the suggestion of the kind lady taking our pizza order.  The Americano had lots of fresh mozzarella, savory sausage, zesty Calabrian Chili Peppers, and the ingredient that gave it the \"wow\" factor pistachio cream.  I never thought pistachios would ever find themselves on a pizza of all things, however it was surprisingly delicious and complimented all the other different flavors going on in the pizza. The pizza crust is done in a Neapolitan style, which is really thin (great for someone watching their carbs).  I felt that the topping to crust ratio was a little off towards the edge of the pizza, however I figured out a way to resolve this problem.  Take a bite of the pizza along with a bite of the crust piece from the previous slice and boom, done! I can see dinner/lunch being a little on the expensive side especially if each person got a pizza (The Americano was $15).  Pizza should never be expensive in my opinion.  Just take my advice, don't come hungry if you are on a budget =) If you are in the mood for gourmet pizza, Citizen Pie is your place"}
{"text":"I got the little Italy pizza and it was incredible! Loaded with toppings and the chewy, wood-fired crust was perfect. I highly recommend. The only thing I thought was odd is they didn't have to go containers for salads. Maybe they were just out? Either way, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Alright. I'm doing it. FIVE STARS!   Easily one of my top 3 Cleveland pizza places (along with Vero and Biga). This may actually be #1. If not, it's #2. Have been here multiple times, and each time I visit, I love it more than the last. I'll admit, I have a huge favorable bias towards Neopolitan-style pizza, but this is the best of the best. I'm thankful it's on the East side of CLE. Hell, I'm thankful it's not in Italy. This stuff is great.  To the pizza: The mushroom pizza (Mozzarella, Brie, Porcini Duxelles, Bacon, Red Onion, Truffle Oil) is SO GOOD. I'm salivating now just writing this review. It's so good I am typing in capital letters. I'll admit, I'm in a bit of a pizza rut with this pizza. I crave it. I think about it in the middle of the day at work sometimes. I could eat 100 of them. I typically will not order a pizza if it doesn't have red sauce. This pizza is my single exception. Oh, and that crust. So perfect.  I've only eaten the pizza in-house, and I imagine it's best eaten straight out of the oven. There aren't a ton of seats inside, but I've never had trouble finding one. My husband and I like to stop in on our way to Cavs games downtown (vs. eating downtown before the game). We love the stools in the windows.   Do not hesitate if you're considering giving this place a try. It's absolutely phenomenal."}
{"text":"The pizza was definitely great, don't get me wrong but the temperature in the place on a hot Sunday was intolerable ... I still can't believe we ate there. I feel like I was sweating the entire time. Also, the value proposition was way off. I mean I'm not familiar with this neighborhood but with a flee market across the street, I am assuming it's not super upscale. The pizzas are quite small for the amount they charge. For two people for lunch, we ordered one pizza and 2 non-alcoholic drinks and we walked out paying just under $30 and truth be told, neither one of us were full. We were looking for a dessert stop next.  Don't get me wrong the pizza is gourmet and fresh ingredients with great sauce, made with artisan flare in a brick oven ... but I don't feel like it's worth the special trip on a hot summer day, maybe more worth it on a fall or winter day. Service was friendly though slightly aloof, which is fine. It's hot in that kitchen. I wouldn't be in the mood to chat with anyone if I worked   Edits: The restaurant responded to my note on prices. I guess for me, in the end, I as a customer judge based on taste. I don't feel as if comparison to Pizza Hut is legit but I'm comparing to my experiences with pizza's that were made in mom and pop's restaurants all over Ohio. While they may not have imported their tomatoes from Italy or sauces from New York, the taste based on grandma's home made recipe made in their rustic brick oven is equally divine. I would happily pay what I paid for a pizza meal but I don't feel like it's a lot to ask to walk out not feeling hungry.   To be honest, for some reason in this part of Ohio, there really isn't as many offerings for artisan pizza. In contrast, try something in Columbus or Cincinnati and even the chains (Dewey's for example) are really top notch. So who knows, maybe this ok and even competitive in this part of town but I still probably won't be back."}
{"text":"OMG, Citizen Pie is the urban pizza of my dreams.  For starters, l love the bomb location across the street from The Beachland Ballroom. The inside of Citizen Pie is small, but full of amazing character. The neighborhood vibe is warm and welcoming, as if everyone knows each other...and the interior is cozily decorated with fun pop art and inspiring Andy Warhol quotes.  But the star of this show is their homemade dough. The dough used on their pizza is d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s. I'm not normally a fan of eating the crust on pizza, but this is hardly crust...its more like really, really good bread. The pizza also only takes 90 seconds to cook thanks to their 15,000 pound Stefano Ferrara pizza oven. This large oven, straight from Naples, cooks the pizza so speedily, that it actually takes longer to assemble the pizza with ingredients then to cook it. You can check on their website for their \"dough-meter\" to gage how much they have left daily, since its made fresh daily.  Onto the good stuff...the Mushroom pizza and Collinwood Supreme are both worthy of six stars. The glory of the Mushroom pizza is the thick brie and bacon (that zings it with flavor), and the Collinwood achieves the most awesome balance of sweet (Italian sausage) and spicy (green chile). There's no possible way their ingredients could be fresher. For dessert, try the tartufo, a delicious combo of ice cream, rum and chocolate.  Citizen Pie doesn't deliver, but I can't imagine that this shockingly authentic pizza would travel well. Once you try Citizen Pie, I doubt you'll ever go back to any other pizza. You'll lick the box clean."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland!  I came here with some friends for the first time.  We each ordered a different pizza, and all tried pieces from each others; each one was better than the last.  My favorite was the Verde (white pizza with spinach, italian sausage, green onions, and crushed pistachios).  This is true Italian style pizza, which is very thin and light, so you're probably going to want to eat a whole pizza.  One minor issue is that the pizza oven can only make a couple of pizzas at a time, so if you go in a group, your pies might come out at different times.  However, this issue is quickly forgotten about when you realize how delicious the pizza is.  You can tell a lot of thought and expertise went into designing each of the pizzas on the menu.  The ingredients and the dough were fresh and the pizzas had so much flavor!  The restaurant is tiny, but the atmosphere is cozy and stylish.  No, they don't serve free glasses of water, but I get it.  This is a new place that took a chance on the neighborhood, and they're trying to make it work; $30,000 pizza ovens imported from Italy take awhile to pay off.    I'm looking forward to coming back and sampling the other pizzas; hopefully they'll rotate the menu, and have some seasonal specialties."}
{"text":"I visited home last month for my sister's graduation, and I wanted her to try this place out with me. We each picked two pizzas from the red side, and the white side. Those pizzas were amazing! I usually don't even like a lot of toppings on my pizza, but the Collinwood pie was perfect! My mother (who rarely ever likes any of the new places I try to introduce her to,) LOVED this place! She even said that it reminded her of the pizza that she tried in Italy back in her Navy days. I wanted to cry lol! Anyway, don't be afraid to try something new."}
{"text":"Gotta be honest... I'm confused by the hype on this one. I'm willing to give it a second try, but our first time here was definitely not great.   My husband & I went in on a Friday night & were pleased to see that it wasn't too packed - just the right amount of busy-ness - but the four guys behind the bar just stared at us as we walked in - no one told us what the process was, whether we should seat ourselves, order from them, etc. Like, literally, they looked at us & then looked away... until we finally asked them. The guy who responded could not have sounded less friendly or enthusiastic. Thanks for the warm welcome, folks.   We split the Little Italy pizza, topped with mozzarella, ground Italian sausage, roasted red peppers, red onions, basil, & oregano - a smallish pie for the $16 it costs, just six slices in total, but we weren't super hungry, so it was enough. It tasted pretty good - nice flavor, thin crust with chewy, doughy edges - but the pizza was just. so. wet. Yes, wet. Like, with water, it seemed. Was something not drained well enough? Was there not enough cheese to bind it? I have no idea, I'm not a pizza expert. All I know was that our pizza tasted good but wouldn't been a whole lot more pleasant to eat had it not been literally sopping wet. Once you picked it up, you had to, like, shove it in your face to finish it quickly or the whole thing fell apart from wetness & sogginess. No, thanks - especially not at that price.  So, yeah. The pizza was in theory good, I liked the atmosphere, & the rose cider I got was delicious, but WHYYYY was the pizza so wet? Like I said, I'll try it again to see if this was an anomaly, but it overall, was just not a very pleasant food experience. I think I'll stick to Crust down the road in Tremont."}
{"text":"2nd location serving up artisan crafted pizza,  love the new spot!  I'm a huge fan of the \"Pesto\" white pizza Nom Nom Nom!  I highly recommend dining here"}
{"text":"Over priced thin crust pizza. Very small dining area if you want to call it that. I asked for a cup of water and was told there was only bottled water. Don't know if they are trying cut back on the dishes they need to clean our just don't have cups but seemed odd nevertheless. Menu also needs a build your own option pizza instead of the few offered. Definitely not in any rush to go back.. Might wait a couple months to see if they make improvements because I do see potential."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Creativity and execution in a perfect marriage. Unfortunate and puzzled by any rating less than 5 stars. Great job Citizen Pie. Love the ice cream at your newest location."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. The pizza was mediocre and on par with any other woodfire pizza. They don't have staff to competently handle take out orders. Don't waste your time until customer service improves."}
{"text":"On my first visit my pizza was great but very light on toppings.   On my second visit today I asked for double toppings and was told that they couldn't do that. I offered to pay for two pizzas but only receive one, and was told they still would not do that. Finally I resorted to a standard pizza off the menu with double cheese. Again I was told they can't do that. At this point I was so annoyed with this guy that I left without ordering a pizza.   Who refuses double cheese orders? That's not right. Now I fully understand the \"communist pie\" nickname.   I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Pizza is bae. That's what all the kids say nowadays right? Consider this a mediocre relationship then. We should probably break up, but I probably won't be able to quit you.  The pros: Great options. Fast cooking. Relaxed atmosphere.  The cons: Limp dick syndrome. \"What's that??\" you ask. It's when you lift up your pizza slice and it droops. I personally think this was happening because of the quick cook time. As a result, the pizza was not throughly cooked. Not raw by any means, but not nice and stiff.    p.s. Not handicap accessible. Bad parking options and a step into the building."}
{"text":"This is absolutely bang-on Neapolitan pizza. They follow exacting technique and deliver perfect little pies. Expect to eat a whole one on your own. Yes, it is a bit pricey, but like a great cocktail, it's worth paying up if you want it done right. The interior is spartan and tight but does its job. I wish this was on my side of town, but it will always be on my radar when I'm heading to the Beachland."}
{"text":"Came here today because the rain killed our day and decided to take the drive to try the best pizza in the land... We got here around 1 and the place was completely empty.. I hate empty restaurants, but luckily this place is super small so you dont feel like a burden like you do in larger restaurants when you have 7 people staring at you while you eat... we got the spinach pizza and split between the 2 of us... We really could of gotten 2 but 1 was just enough. Toppings were fresh and pizza was ready in minutes.. Very cool sitting at the bar and watching the pizza cook in their cool wood burning oven. The best part is the crust... If they made bread sticks with their dough i may return for 2 orders of them because thats how good the crust is.  Wish it wasn't so far a way... when in the mood for pizza and a drive we will be back."}
{"text":"Authentic fire oven pizza made with fresh ingredients. Really good.  I would highly recommend to anyone and would easily come back again."}
{"text":"Rad joint. Cozy place with a great vibe. Guys working where very friendly.  Wine on tap was wonderful. The pizza came out quick. Amazing flavor. I will definitely be back! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Citizen Pie is just what the doctor ordered. I stopped here before a show at Beachland Ballroom (Located across the street). This wasn't a life-shattering original idea-- the place was packed with people who were also trying to grab a bite to eat before 8:30 show time.   Seating is pretty limited, but thankfully we were able to score two stools near the window. Pizza was served up after about 15 minutes, an impressive feat considering the crowd.    I love when wood-fired pizza is done right: Chewy with just the right amount of crispy char. And Citizen Pie does it right.   My husband and I split a Caponata which was topped with Mozzarella, Ricotta, Oil Cured Olives, Eggplant, Cherry Tomatoes, Pine Nuts, Currants, and Basil ($15). Such a great combination! Everything was subtle so it probably could have used just a touch of salt to bring out some of the flavors, but red pepper flakes got the job done.   One pizza was just the right amount of food for my husband and I, but if you're particularly hungry, you might want to claim your own pie. There's no judgement here.   Winner winner pizza dinner!"}
{"text":"Crust is perfect! Flavor combos are perfect! Every pie I have had there has been a work of art both visually and gastronomically."}
{"text":"There is no debate in Cleveland if where to get the best pizza. They created Cleveland style pizza. In fact, I am getting hungry writing this. If you haven't been here make it your mission to go have a pie today."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing, no lie!! Don't trust the dough meter. I went there at 645 pm on a Sunday after checking the website. They had at least 1/3 of the days dough left. Pulled up and the sign says out of dough. Went in to confirm and they hadn't had time to update the website. 20 minute drive one way from Lyndhurst wasted."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh pizza! Made in front of you, too. We were in and out within 20 minutes. The place is really small but trendy and fun. I would certainly return!"}
{"text":"First class stone oven pizza. Stopped in for a \"fast\" lunch.   The pizza choices are pre established not sure how open they are to creating your own as I did not see a list of toppings. The pizzas consist of white and red.  As in red sauce or white as in no red but other bases.  We chose 2. First a marinara off the red side which was a cheeseless choice with a nice depth of flavor without the dairy. Fresh basil made this pie very enjoyable.  My husband chose a ham and cheese from the white side.  We decided the topping qualities were wonderful. You can tell care and concern went into the selection of toppings. Evident as well as we watched a lunch only sandwich option being prepared as we stood in line to order.  Size of the pizzas are enough to share. We saw a table if 3 with 3 pizzas and they had a lot to take home.   Where we fell short was the flavor of the crust. We both agreed it just had no flavor. It came out crisp but the flavor just wasn't there.  The young lady who took our order was pleasant. The 2 men never smiled and when we asked for a box we were lectured on how wood oven pizza was best eaten there. Yes understood but when running late you do what you have to do. I was able to crisp it back up in my oven no problem.  The beverage situation is dismal. Would be better to have bottled waters as an option to the self serve water, and if you are going to offer bottled tea step up the game to a higher quality option."}
{"text":"I've been on a quest with some friends to find the best pizza in Cleveland and Citizen Pie was a recommended eatery to try.  Pros: super fast, I think the pizza oven cooks them something ridiculously fast like 2 minutes.  Lots of pizza topping varieties - for people who like a more gourmet pizza experience with unique toppings and combinations, you'll be pleased here.  Pizzas are mostly individual sized so you can order a few varieties.  As a vegetarian, decent offerings and options of pizza combos for me.    Cons: location is nice but not super comfortable for chilling and relaxing - more like a fast casual restaurant with harder seats.  If you're looking for a classic cheese or pepperoni, it's nothing special here.  We took a few pizzas to go, big mistake, they quickly got soggy in the box.  You must eat the pizza on-site.  The journey for an amazing pizza continues..."}
{"text":"Okay, we were hungry for dinner and wanted to order out, but couldn't decide on a place...then I remembered bookmarking Citizen Pie here on Yelp.  After looking through the photographs, my husband and I were sold.  Plus, it's only a fifteen minute drive from our house in Cle Heights.  We order for pick-up, and it's fifteen minutes till it's ready, so my dude leaves right away. We ordered two pizzas ($30)...the Margherita and the Caponata.   First, the pizzas are smaller than expected for $15.00 each.  But, I think this is ok because it must be superior ingredients and quality.   First, I see the small boxes and I'm like, whatever.  Then I pick them up.  They're super light.  The pizza was cold, and very, very flat and mooshy.  The sauce on the Margherita pizza was very acidic.  I couldn't eat it, and my kid gave up as well. The Caponata tasted much better, yet cold and mooshy as well.  I liked the toppings but there was barely any on it...one pine nut per three pieces?  One currant on one slice?  Why was this pizza so much money?  It looked nothing like the Yelp photos!  There were teeny pieces of eggplant and roasted peppers; diced, nay, minced! The best part of the pizza was the crust.  I liked the crust...it's a pity that's all I wanted to eat of the pizza.  The individual components (except the red sauce) were high quality, but it just didn't work as the ratios were off, and the product does not hold up, even for fifteen minutes.  Our dinner ended with me making something else for the kid, and apologizing to my husband for suggesting this place, which was such a disappointment.   Now, if you must try this place, eat there.  Do not order it for take away.  It's too fragile.   I'd only try this place again if I dined in.  Maybe then it would be better!"}
{"text":"Had to try this place out since it was so close to home! I was excited to try a new pizza place in town... ordered the mushroom white pizza ... was expecting to be wow'd by the pizza but not even close.. especially for $16 ..   The dough was very fresh tasting and pizza was ready in just a few minutes on the plus side.. mushrooms were very fresh but I wasn't crazy about the whole pizza... pizza was dripping juice everywhere and the men on staff were a bit rude... but if you're going for a quick bite to eat and don't mind paying the price then citizen pie is your place"}
{"text":"We love this spot! Cozy family pizza time- fast and delicious! All the pizzas are made to perfection and it's a taste you will crave:)"}
{"text":"Heard about these guys and decided to stop by on a sat night. Was empty! A bit surprising but no complaints here. It's a block down from crop but on 25th.. was plenty of street parking though walking from the main strip wouldn't be bad either.  Staff was immediately friendly and checked in on us a few times while we were there. 5 stars for them.  We got the diavola and cacio e Pepe white pizza. Pizzas were made quickly - that 90 second cook time is no joke. We love the diavola from Beerheads for it's consistent heat and we're wondering what this would be like. The Diavola was good but unfortunately nothing special. There were traces of heat centered on the with peppers but other bites were mild. Maybe 3 stars for this one (so average).   The cacio e Pepe on the other hand was pretty good. It was pretty soupy - a good amount of olive oil and the stracciatella. Would give this a 4-4.5 stars.  The crust on both was nice and soft when you bit into it, but had enough crisp to hold a little form. You definitely need to fold the slices in half, then support the tip a bit to keep things from falling.  The dough and bake get 4.5 stars.  Overall, had a great experience. Would stop by if craving pizza while out in Ohio City. There are a lot of great pizza places popping up, and this is definitely one of them!"}
{"text":"Very cozy small place. Pizza is AMAZING!!!! They don't do any substitutions and additions to the pies but honestly you don't need to, it's perfect the way they make it. The pie can be shared or if you are really hungry you may want one to yourself.  Will be back for sure... The decor is nice..."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group as we were craving pizza. The menu has plenty of awesome options. It was hard for me to make a decision. Eventually I decided to order the Pesto pizza with no olives and my boyfriend got a pepperoni pizza. I found the prices to be a little on the high side for an individual pizza. Most of the options were $15 dollars and up. The pizza is thin and it was a little hard to eat because when you pick it up it doesn't stay stiff. The ingredients were fresh and yummy though. They have water you can get for yourself with tiny styrofoam cups. If you are thirsty and only want water, plan to walk back and forth to the water many times.. lol.  It would be nice if they had some larger cups. Overall the pizza was good but nothing amazing. Next time we will choose somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Upon walking in, my friends and I were immediately greeting by all of the staff. Everyone was friendly and nice! The staff talked us through the menu to offer us the best options for our tastebuds.  Food was nothing special unfortunately. I've had WAY better pizza that was way cheaper. I probably won't be back only because the food is overpriced and not great."}
{"text":"First time here- got fast service and a great thin crust wood fired oven Margarita pizza- delicious! This is a small place, cozy with lots of high chairs against two counters where you can watch them make your pizza. I'll come back when I visit Cleveland again!"}
{"text":"Loved this pizza, we got two pies take out and they were good, the crust chewy and crisp, the sauce of high quality and flavorful. Really great thin sliced Neapolitan style pizza. Didn't encounter a soggy slice issue. I think this is a solid place to get a pizza, but I would recommend eating the pizza in as I'm sure it will taste better right out of the oven."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a citizen pie! The people were friendly, the restaurant itself Is beautiful and the pizza was great. It comes out so stinking fast! The only reason I took away a star is because the price. For two small pizzas it was over $30, which is way more than I was planning on paying for two large pizzas, much less two smalls."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Cleveland! Had never been to this area before, but I'll definitely be coming back for this. If you're a fan of thin crust pizza - try this place!"}
{"text":"Items Selected: Margherita - Mozzarella, Basil, Crushed Tomatoes, Olive Oil Tartufo - Frozen Dark Chocolate with Rum, Amarena Cherry  Soon expanding its Neapolitan concept to a second store, Citizen Pie has quickly made its name amongst Clevelanders as *the* place for artisan Pizza despite a somewhat out-of-the-way location at 15710 Waterloo Road, the limited menu in no way indicative of a lack of craftsmanship, though lessons in customer service could certainly do the youthful staff some good.  Quick-fire in its concept, a single communal table and bar offered for dining in after orders are placed at the counter up front, it was to a disinterested young man that a few questions were directed before making a selection, a patron apparently seen as a distraction to conversation with his beanie-clad friends.  Told that they 'don't do' water by the glass, a seat thus taken with nothing to drink, it was in brisk motions that dough was stretched, topped and placed in the oven, a few turns and twists seeing the piping-hot pie soon presented tableside with plenty of blisters and a great deal of yeastiness, the sauce pure and unsweetened with a center that was droopy but not 'wet.'  Deciding to order dessert, the pre-made Tartufo tiny but rich with Cocoa and Rum, it was once again in an attempt to engage the staff that inquisition was made about the wood imparting crusts with such smoke and flexibility, the answer \"I dunno man, it's a blend I guess,\" again making one question the team's passion, though a later message from the owner via Social Media assured me that such behavior was not what Citizen Pie stands for, and that it would be addressed."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth a try. They make the pizza right in front of you in a brick oven and it's done in seconds. The ingredients all seemed fresh and the staff were friendly and helpful. The menu was impressive as far as pizzas go with both white sauce pizza and red sauce pizza and even options for salad pizzas. I tried a red sauce pizza with chorizo. I thinnk it was called the Spanish or Spaniard. It was tasty. This is a laid back casual environment. It has tables as well as a bar area right up close to the oven. I'd like to go back and try a white sauce pizza or I over heared someone order an all dressed pizza that had arugula and prosciutto on top that looked really good. Going back forsure!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here at random and was glad I did. This small shop makes a very good pizza in a really cool atmosphere. I stick to the basics at a new pizza joint so I decided to try the pepperoni and I definitely wasn't disappointed.   The only reasons for the four and not five star review is the very limited drink menu and the fact that it is very small. Had it not been an off peak hours time, I am sure our wait would have been significantly longer.   Overall, definitely recommend stopping by if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Had heard a lot about it and couldn't wait to try it! Went on a Friday night and what a treat. After my order was taken the pizza appeared in front of me in a few minutes. Have to say it was one of the best pizzas I ever had. I thought I might have some to take home but that was impossible. I ate the whole thing. I sat at the counter and talked to some friendly people. The owner was there and I spoke to him and told him how much I enjoyed it. He was very nice answering my questions and telling me about the oven from Italy and all the ingredients he uses. Can't wait to go back and told all my friends about it."}
{"text":"Great selection, very fresh herbs and veggies, awesome cheese, and cool staff and atmosphere too! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Really excellent that is sort of like a custom tailored suit. It is pizza, but then so much better."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, probably the best I've had in Cleveland. Similar to pizza we had in Naples.  We ordered the spinach which was a wonderful combination of flavors. Everything beautifully fresh.  I would give Citizen 5 stars if the pizza had been baked another minute and If they offered water. I would even have paid $.50 for a cup and a pitcher of water. The pizza is served on a pan. Since we were splitting it we used napkins as plates.   We had the tartufo desert. When we were in Italy it was in many restaurants. This was far better than anything we tasted there. Bravo citizen pizza!"}
{"text":"Fast and fresh!!! I bring work groups here for lunch, or occasional after work for a quick slice of delicious pizza.  A little expensive, and I wished they had tap water instead of bottled drinks to make up for it."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to stop in. Did a pizza 4 way with americano, caponata, mushroom, cacio e Pepe. Very tasty can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Diavola and Americano are my go too. Ready in a jiffy(2 or 3 minutes). Get an ekstra svyturys lager, it a lithuanian Budweiser. A little to go box for a must have later day snack. Nothing more though. Thin crust, fresh ingredients, pistachio cream and fresh marinara make this place a must have at least every other week."}
{"text":"After receiving a response about my review I gave it some thought and have changed my 4 star rating to a 5 star rating. Two reasons: 1. While I may disagree with some of the choices of who is on the mural, she did make a good point. She also agreed that Fidel Castro was questionable. I appreciate her response and honesty. 2. After reflecting on it for some time I realize that it was inappropriate for me to judge their restaurant based on a mural that may or may not have a political slant. I was there for pizza. I should have judged only that. Therefore, a strong 5 stars. My apologies."}
{"text":"It's stupid that this place isn't packed. I hate you cleveland, and your horrible pizza taste. This is a pizza place we desperately needed, but clearly don't deserve."}
{"text":"Finally tried it, finally had a good pie in Cleveland.  The best around."}
{"text":"Pie is spot on. Its amazing! Our three year old loved it as well. Staff is very kind. Pizza best in Cleveland."}
{"text":"First time here and everyone was really nice! They thanked me coming in and were very cool. Great atmosphere and art inside with good music. We got 2 pizzas and they were so, so good! Awesome crust and great toppings, so fast too. As a 4 year local, I'm kicking myself for not coming in before. We'll be here often, for sure!"}
{"text":"Stopped in w family for a bite on Saturday afternoon. Restaurant was pleasant as was the staff. We were greeted as soon as we entered and sat down. Menu was great. We ordered the seasonal pizza which was corned beef, creamed kale, potatoes etc as well as the Smoked Pepperoni Pizza and added sausage. We sat at the bar and watched as they made our pizzas. They were very attentive and detailed in their prep. Fired in a wood oven. Came out quick and delicious. I would recommend stopping by if you want some great pizza from great people!"}
{"text":"Came here hungry last weekend. Small space, but there were seats available. Got the Little Italy pizza. Sausage was really good! Wonder if it was from the sausage shop next door? Anyway, was not disappointed. Awesome spot for the neighborhood. THough I bet it gets slammed before and after Beachland shows."}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles l, I have tried many pizzas as there are new pizza shops opening daily. This pizza was delicious! Crisp on edges yet chewy. Well run small operation."}
{"text":"Food:  We ordered Spinach and Little Italy. Compared to Vero, the size is about 1.5 times bigger. Also, toppings were very fresh and generous. Especially, I loved that they put sufficient amount of mozzarella cheese evenly. The nutty flavor from Walnut pesto was wonderful with bacon and spinach. Little Italy was very good as well. Crust was chewy, but it was little wet on the bottom due to generous toppings, which I prefer if I have to choose.   I love the combination of toppings in their menu, such as having brie and truffle oil on Mushroom pizza, and pistachio cream in another pizza. I will definitely come back to try different pizzas next time.   Also, for beverages, you need to purchase a bottled water ($2) if you want just water.  Atmosphere:   Not many seats. Bar-style seating at the counter and the wall, and a big table in the middle. Very clean, self-service system.  Would I come again:  Yes!"}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday for late-ish dinner (7:30), and given the time, day, and bad weather, we weren't super surprised that we were the only customers when we went in. Employees were helpful, friendly but not in an oppressive way, and definitely seemed knowledgeable. It's order-at-the-counter style, so drinks were received immediately (good beer selection), and pizzas took maybe 7-10 mins. Not a bad wait at all. We got the Spring special, a pepperoni, and a Cacio e Pepe. All tasted fresh, all were warm out of the oven. Really good flavor combos. The dough was definitely the highlight, though. Neapolitan inspired, with just a tiny bit of char. Really good music selections and decor too. Wish they were open later! Would be absolutely top notch after a concert or drinks in OC."}
{"text":"My husband and I usually find ourselves here before any show we catch at the Beachland. Their pizza is incredibly delicious!  The ingredients are so fresh and the crust is tasty. The beer and wine selection is small but I always find something I like!  (I usually go with one of their wines on tap.) My plan is to eventually eat my way through their menu but lately we can't seem to tear ourselves away from \"The Collinwood\"! With everything I just mentioned combined with fast & friendly service?  What's not to love?!?!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great.   Neapolitan style with moderate char to the crust.  It would be better if they also served salad or something,  but if you want a good, thin pizza,  this is the place."}
{"text":"Best Napoleon style pizza in Cleveland! (Maybe an exaggeration) but it's REALLY good! Loved the music & all the artwork! If they were on UberEATS I'd be in trouble. Truly a great addition to Ohio City!"}
{"text":"If you want Italy pizza in CLE - This is your place! So good, quality ingredients, friendly staff, really cool interior.  So many selections of pies and they cook in minutes! The food was excellent!"}
{"text":"I've been a patron of the Waterloo location since they opened so we went to the west side location since it's closer. We generally order a few pies and a few drinks so together we spend $60.   Experience at the new location was NOT so great!  Staff was not friendly and more rude than usual!  Pizza was soggy in the middle on all 2 of 3 pies! (Seriously how does this even happen)   For the price, the pizza should be on point. Also, I hope you don't order anything spicy because you'll  have to buy horrible tasting cardboard boxed water since they don't offer tap. It's pretty unfriendly to not off free water from the tap. I'm sure cleaning glasses or getting disposable cups does not cost much when factoring in that you're charging so much for pizza. The whole experience has left a bad taste in our mouths."}
{"text":"This place totally lives up to the hype. You gotta come here and try it.  There isn't much to say except get in your car and come get some pizza."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. We got the bacon and fig, and also the salad pizza with greens/balsamic. It's very DIY as far as getting your plates, silverware, napkins and boxes so as long as you're expecting that it's cool. Pizzas are about $16 each from the ones we considered. The crust is so light and good I felt like I could keep eating it! If I could do half stars I'd give one, but I couldn't muster up a whole one.  Check out the boutiques and stores nearby when you check this place out (which yes, I recommend that you do)."}
