{"text":"Eggplant entrée was fantastic.  Avocado curry was fantastic, my wife said.  It was a little too spicy for me even at \"mild\".  Chicken kabob was also tasty.  We ordered delivery to our hotel room, which was a little difficult conveying the correct address, there is a little bit of a language barrier over the phone.  But that barrier lens a bit to the authenticity right!  Our children loved the eggplant and kabobs and rice.  All the entrées came with rice.  Generous portions."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken cashew! The smell was indescribable, it was the best thing I ever had. I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Very good! VERY spicy! Order down a notch on the spice meter - you'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"This is the first time i've left a review on yelp because this place was just amazing and deserves all of the stars! I ordered the Sabai fried rice and it was piping hot when it arrived and so delicious. Sweet and savoury, it was exactly like the ones they serve in Thailand and just what I was craving. I also ordered the spring rolls which were good but not as amazing as the fried rice and the Thai iced tea which was also good and tasted authentic but a little sweet. Delivery took less than an hour and the food arrived hot and the drink ice cold. 5 stars. Can't wait to try their pad thai and tom yum soup next time!"}
{"text":"this place was great right after it opened, but lately its been really disappointing. The last 3 times that I've ordered food from this location its been under season to the point that there's no flavor. I go to the location on 44th st and Thomas every so often on my lunch break and they're amazing. I  love their Pumpkin curry and figured that it would be the same at the on the fly location. Boy was I wrong. not only did it not have any flavor, but it was extremely water downed. 

today I just went and picked up some spicy noodles - medium spicy - and there is no sauce or spice on it at all. I've had this dish before from this location so I know what to expect when its made right. 

unfortunately, I don't think I'll be coming back to this location anymore."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever, when I didn't even finish my food, already give me the check, wanted me to pay& rush me to leave?ok fine I packed all my food,but the guy refuse to give me a plastic bag, you know what he told me \"I need to keep the bags because it might not be enough for the rest of the week\"? Seriously you make me holding 3 Togo containers on my hand, & you guys can't afford to get more plastic bags? I also give him tips,but for this bad customer service you shouldn't deserve any, he never say thank u but he did to other customers, it's ok you don't care about the business, I will never return to this place!!!!!If I can give \"Zero\" stars I will!!!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from Sa Bai 2-3 times and have consistently been pleased! My meals have been ready for pickup quickly, and the portions are huge. For appetizers, I've tried the crispy spring rolls and crab wontons - both of which are good, though I probably prefer the wontons. The little salad with peanut dressing (that they serve with appetizers) is a nice touch. As far as entrees go, I've only ever ordered the Pad Thai from this restaurant, but I like it so much that I cant see why I'd order anything else. There are several other Thai places just as close to my house that I could order from, but I keep going back to Sa Bai because of positive past experiences. The restaurant is usually pretty empty inside when I've been by (last time it was completely dead), so perhaps takeout is the way to go."}
{"text":"Ok food. Friendly service.
Phad Tai was too watery and the spring rolls were pretty much store bought tasting. 

Quick lunch pickup place- ok
Dinner place?  Not a chance."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai Food to say the least.

Came here with some friends and was very impressed.

Avocado Curry, Satay, Thai Lettuce Wraps...All 10/10

Perfect temperature, texture, and the taste was outstanding of every dish.

Will be back for more very soon!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in Tempe in a while... So totally delicious and high quality."}
{"text":"This is great to-go Thai food. I've ordered the Jalapeño curry twice, both times hot. The curry has the perfect amount of spice and includes lots of fresh peppers and veggies. The beef is typical beef you would find in a curry, no surprise there. This is much better than average green curry. The portions are most excellent, you get a big container of curry for only $8.  Although you get a lot of food for your money, don't expect left overs because it's that good.  

Service is good and staff is friendly. I'm extremely happy to have a good to-go Thai restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Holy shit the boba... Holy shit dude. I'm going to the dentist tomorrow. This boba tasted like rocks like I'm paying fucking 5$ for a couple rocks in some ice? You kidding me mate? Plus they took like 10 years to come out with 4 drinks when NO ONE was in that God forbidden place. Like Jesus Christ almighty please come down and reign hell upon their tapioca machines or whatever holy hell. Their food is good though."}
{"text":"Great food. Was a five star when it first opened. Taste has slightly deteriorated since.

Will surely go back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times always great service and even better food. Cant go wrong with the cashew chicken or massaman curry!"}
{"text":"Without reading any review. Tried this place. Omg. Being vegetarian,  they made sure our order was up to mark. Lettuce wrap. Wow. The peanut sauce was amazing. First time tried avacado curry. It was good. Spicy noodles i think i ordered medium hot but for me spicy . Over all one of the best thai food"}
{"text":"I love spicy food but, since I've never ordered from this place before, I asked for my chicken pad Thai \"medium-spicy\". OMG!!! I might as well said nuke me!  My lips were burning on the third bite. Now, I really enjoyed it as it was flavorful and peanutty but if you are sensitive to heat, ask for it bland. The delivery was fast and they added a delivery charge (which is basically a tip as it goes to the driver) so less math for me. They did forget the utensils, but my hotel room was equipped with sturdy wooden coffee stirrers which I improvised into chop sticks so tragedy was averted once again."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Reasonable prices. Panko fried shrimp were amazing, large and butterflied. A nice crispy treat. Papaya salad was fresh, large and fun. This is a nice casual place/to-go place for Thai. Stop in! :-)"}
{"text":"Very clean and pleasant establishment, it's gives a whole new appreciation to businesses that care about what they do."}
{"text":"New favorite Thai spot, the yellow curry is perfect. The rest of the menu looks delicious, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I'm always up for trying new restaurants, so naturally when I saw this being advertised over in Tempe from Groupon, I took it!
Did not regret it. Parking is good. Business is friendly. Food is fresh. The portions won't leave your stomach growling for more, either. We ordered Tom Yum soup, Pad Thai, and Avocado Curry. I'd do it again."}
{"text":"This my second visit to Sabai  in less than a month! Why? simply because it is better than over a dozen Thai places I  have had in Phoenix! On my first visit, I ordered the Green Curry, plenty of flavor with the right consistency of sauce. I could tell they use fresh ingredients. On my second visit, I was more confident in their food that I ordered the Pad Thai. It was delicious!  The service is excellent and the restaurant is clean.  So if your picky about your Thai food like me, give Sabai a try! FYI:  Sabai has two location one in Tempe (broadway)  and one in Phoenix (Thomas and 42nd)"}
{"text":"My local Thai fix.   

Everything so far is delicious prices are also good for the portions you get"}
{"text":"Super good Thai Food holy crap!And the people are pretty friendly. That's always a good thing :B


My sister and I ordered Pad Thai (bc that's standard), Tom Yum soup, curry (but I'm not sure; that's my sister's choice). Ima tell you, that Pad Thai was sweeter than expected but it was so yum like I don't like sweet food but that was the bomb. I didn't have the curry one since I'm not a curry fan, but I always like Tom Yum that was pretty good too. It's not fast food that's fsho but they do takeout and delivery. I'm super glad they opened up cuz I love Thai food. Sabai sabai~ You'll see me again!"}
{"text":"I guess it's decent. Got there pad Thai beef and honestly just tastes like noodles with sweet and sour Sauce, and only 5 pieces of beef. Kinda lame."}
{"text":"Finally! Delicious Thai food! I have been searching and searching and finally I found Sai Bai. MJ had a curry beef dish called Mussaman. The beef spare ribs were so tender they melted in your mouth. I almost traded him dishes but my Pad Thai with chicken was so amazing we just shared them. I love Pad Thai but I always order it a little less sweet and a little more spicy. I like it hot and when you ask for spicy here it is really spicy! Be warned. The ambiance is nice and the service was great.  My favorite Thai so far."}
{"text":"Great food here.  I am basic so I get pad see ew everytime.  The thai hot is super spicy.  I love spice, but this is not for the faint of heart.  You've been warned!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered here twice so, totaling 6 or so items. You couldn't ask for better Thai delivery. Very nice sized portions with great flavor. When you ask for hot you get hot! The crab wontons and pad Thai will be in my regular rotation. Don't hesitate when it tells you 45-60 minutes, both times have been delivered in under 30 minutes. I've gotten the same guy both times as well who is very nice and polite. Keep up the good work over there guys you've earned a regular customer!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious!!! Their portions are huge on the entrees, deserts, and drinks. I would definitely recommend their tai tea and for dessert: chocolate brownie and I cream. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Sa Bai On The Fly brings some much needed food variety to an area plagued with nothing but fast food. The woman at the front desk was very attentive and made us feel like valued customers. We ordered the Spring Rolls, Pad Thai and Spicy Pan Noodles. Everything came out promptly and tasted great. The chef even came out to ask us if we enjoyed the meal.

I'm happy to see new food options in the area. Especially a place that has good food. Prices were very reasonable and we got great portion sizes. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Sa Bai has been my favorite Thai restaurant for years. I haven't been here for nearly a year for various reasons, and the lady who works behind the counter remembered my exact order, down to the details of spice level and leaving the egg out. She's amazing! Everyone I've taken here has gotten just as hooked as I have."}
{"text":"I just ordered from here on some random delivery app I just downloaded because I needed some Thai food in my life ASAP. I am so impressed with this place! Delivery didn't take long maybe 40 minutes, and the delivery man was very nice. We got pad see ew (asked for chicken instead of beef and they got it right!  Yay), pad thai, and Tom yum soup. Everything was literally piping hot I am very impressed. I've gotten dishes at restaurants before that weren't even this hot lol good job guys! We will definitely be ordering from you again very soon! Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. I tried this place from a Groupon and have been back multiple times. The food is great and the owners/family are so nice. They were quite busy with numerous to go orders so we had to wait quite a while for our order but that is to be expected with a small business that has gained popularity. The coco soup is awesome, I get it every visit. Words of wisdom would be to be ware of the spicy levels. Got my pad thai med and it was hella spicy. Thai hot is REALLY freaking hot!!!"}
{"text":"My husband eats here every other night!  Thank you Sa Bai!  We love the noodles, delish, spicy and flavorful."}
{"text":"Out of all the Thai places I've tried in the tempe area sa bai is by far the best! The food is delicious! The place is great for take out since there is limited seating inside!"}
{"text":"Small place but very clean. The food are decent, and prices are reasonable. If the Thai tea could be less sweetener, then everything would be perfect! (Personal taste, not for everyone though)"}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing service. I got the pad se iew and it's easily the best one I've had in the valley. 100% better than Thai basil and I completely recommend coming and stoping by. The owner is so sweet also and wants to make sure you are having amazing food."}
{"text":"Have been looking for a yummy papaya salad in Phoenix. finally, i found one here that is inexpensive. I give the salad two thumbs up because you guys hooked me up with huge serving of papaya and lime juice. I didn't give a five stars because the pad Thai dish I ordered is missing veggies, it was kinda dry and salty when I wanted spicy but again you hooked me up with lots of noodles and chicken. Overall delicious. Recommended to anyone looking for juicy papaya salad."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to places for take out. We always order the Classic Curry and the Mussaman and they're both delicious not to mention the portion is huge. Everyone here is always kind and they always have our order waiting for us when we pick it up."}
{"text":"They charge before they even serve you so since I had a credit card a tip wasn't possible but that's their fault. I didn't bring any cash with me. If you want a tip you should charge at the end of the meal like everyone else. The portion was small for the price. It was almost $10 for a small bowl of red curry tofu with rice. I was hoping the portion would be way bigger after reading the reviews. I guess it was sort of normal size for Thai places in Arizona. I got the red curry tofu Aka Kang Dang Curry and asked for it to be extra spicy. They weren't joking around when it comes to how spicy it was. This was probably the most spicy thai dish I have ever had. I loved it. It had a different taste than any other Thai place I have been to,  couldn't figure out what the taste was that was different  but it was a good different. I guess it didn't have as much of a coconut milk taste as other places do but somehow it was even sweeter, maybe it was the pineapples in it.  I don't recall if this dish ever came with pineapples anywhere else. They put a peanut sauce on the salad on the side, I'll ask them not to put it on it next time I come. Maybe I won't ask for it to be so spicy next time cause wow this was extremely hot. I loved the dish and will be coming back. The cashier/server was nice. Her name was Pia. She checked up on us to see if the food was alright and if we wanted more water.  Nice little restaurant."}
{"text":"I discovered this place by their original location off Thomas st, and loved it. I was overjoyed when I moved to Tempe and found this place opening up next door! Service was quick and the waitress was very friendly and attentive. I always get the pad see eiw or pad Thai, and I'm not a huge fan of pad Thai in general but theirs is bomb. The lettuce wraps are really good too. Oh, and the prices are definitely reasonable. We will definitely be regulars here!!"}
{"text":"Man I use to really like this place but they recently have screw up the order every time. I ordered vegetable curry with brown rice tonight and got chicken curry with white rice. It happens all the time...even the food is not what it was and I use to eat there at least once a week usually twice but they have completely lost my business not worth the hassle or the inconsistency of the food."}
{"text":"The food was good, very hot. Had the curry and the crab wontons were very tasty. Paper plates and tiny place."}
{"text":"The woman behind the counter, the \"owner\" her name is Pia she is selling fake beats by Dre headphones to people and she tried to rip me off by going on offer up under a fake male name. Shady shady people."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We just got back from visiting Thailand a few months ago and have been missing good thai food. This place taste like I'm back. I loved it. And it has great prices."}
{"text":"The best Thai food i had. Tum yum soup had awesome flavor cooked perfectly.  Avocado curry was good. Egg plant Thai was so good. Vegetables cooked perfectly. The people were great. All I could say if I am in this area I would come back again. You got to try this place out."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times but I never had such a bad experience before. The food was delivered quickly but most of it was at the bottom of the plastic bag. The food was just awful to boot. The coco soup taste like it was cooked with dirty socks and the pad Thai taste like it was left out for a day before it got to me. Never again will I order from here."}
{"text":"When they first opened there were some great vegan options. Now they don't tell you that egg is in many of their dishes. This is very disappointing. The last few times I have ordered, my food came with egg even though it's not listed. The lettuce wraps were originally made with tofu but now it's chicken. Please list all of your ingredients."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. When orders are wrong, the customer should come first. I appreciated the original location but my experience has turned me off from both, now!"}
{"text":"Great food and easy to grab some takeout. But really the food is good, don't let there focus on takeout fool you, they are making great food. We usually get some curry and pad Thai, but we always get the lettuce wraps, delicious."}
{"text":"I have been craving an authentic \"Thai tea\" and I stumped upon this restaurant while I was waiting on my RX to be filled at Walgreens as it's right down the shopping center. I walked into pleasant employee willing to help me and take my order. I was just looking for the Thai tea mostly but I also got 5 piece egg roll to go. My order was ready within 5-7 minutes with my Thai tea which looked amazing. I took one sip and I am glad that I found this place! The Thai tea is awesome and I will make this regular thing when I pick up medicine from CVS.."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice and each time the service has been friendly and prompt. The price is comparable to most take-out places and there are some tables for dine-in. $8 for a decent portion of chicken curry, rice, and a small salad. I'm not sure why people are expecting the price to be like the dollar menu at McDonald's. My only complaint would be the spicy level of the curry, their \"hot\" is not spicy at all. Very mild."}
{"text":"Food was fresh but lacked flavor. Too expensive for what you get.

Tried this place with a Groupon. Even with the half price discount, we spent $40 for a balanced lunch. Taste wasn't there, either.  Experience was more disappointing than positive, and in that Price range, there's a lot better places to dine."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food.. everything from spring rolls to satay, from avocado curry to pad that, tastes great. If you really want to challenge yourself try the 'Thai hot' level of spice in your food."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best Thai food I have ever had. I had been craving Thai food recently and this restaurant had great reviews so we decided to give it a try and I am so glad we did. The restaurant itself is a little on the small side but extremely clean and the ambience is nice. We ordered the chicken satay, spicy Thai fried rice with chicken and classic yellow curry (which came with boiled white rice). We opted for the medium spice level which was nice, next time I might try the spicy though. The food came out very quickly and the staff was polite. The prices are very reasonable as well. The yellow curry was perfectly seasoned and flavorful, as was the fried rice. The chicken satay was grilled to perfection and crisp. Overall very pleased with the food and service and would highly recommend this restaurant. This is our new go to place!

P.S: Try their Thai iced coffee, it is excellent!"}
{"text":"Like many other SoCal folks that reviewed this place, as much as we wanted to like it based on the other reviews, we were left disappointed. 

The menu was good, a lot of options to choose from depending on what you feel like on that day. They have a number of stir-fried, rice and noodle dishes in addition to appetizers and salads. We saw that they had papaya salad so we were excited to give that a try since you don't see that at a lot of Thai restaurants anymore nowadays. We also got yellow curry chicken, since you can never go wrong with that! ....but we were wrong ): The curry was EXTREMELY sweet and watery, chicken was rubbery and rice was dry and not Jasmine-y. The papaya salad had a bed of lettuce on the bottom, which was so strange to me. At least they used real papaya but it was also sweet and not as flavorful as I would have liked. Usually in papaya salad you can smell/taste the different flavors like garlic, fish sauce, slight sweetness from the palm sugar and sourness from the fresh lime. The Thai tea was not too bad, you can tell it's real tea, just very creamy from all the cream they put on top. Once I asked them to add a bit more tea, it was better. 

One thing that really bothered me was the fact that everything came in disposable plates/bowls.. like super cafeteria style, or as if you're at church/temple. It didn't give that restaurant vibe. I guess I wouldn't mind if I was still in college but for the price point, I think they can invest in some dishes. Overall, I thought it was ok if that's the only Thai place you have access to. As for me, I will most likely not come back if you want my honest opinion. I'm just not a fan of one flavor, which for this place would be sweet."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food. I've lived in the valley for 3 years and have eaten at multiple thai restaurants. This place takes the gold so far. We ordered chicken satay, spicy fried noodles, sa bai fried rice, and the thai eggplant. All were perfect with some sweet heat and really solid portions. The staff was friendly and so was the price ($33 - what?!). I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"We were at t mobile and decided to give this place a try. The worker was very rude who was taking my order. We ordered the pad Thai which was decent, good 4 solid stars and we ordered the fresh spring rolls.... the lady had asked me what kind of meat I had wanted in them and we were ordering to go. When my husband and I got home we opened the box there was absolutely no meat in any of the rolls and the rolls were so put together so horribly that the rice paper wrap was breaking and everything fell out. We didn't have time to take it back but I was pissed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Our first take out experience was not great - so glad we gave it another chance. Today, the service was fast and friendly. Food was delicious - really, really good. We had Thai iced tea and Thai lemonade - both really good. Tofu lettuce wraps, chicken, & pad Thai all were yummy. Medium spice was perfect. Great for takeout or small area for eating in. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went here on a groupon and were quite impressed.  The service took awhile but the food was fresh and made to order.  The meat was tender and plentiful in one dish and the vegetables were fresh in the other dish.  The Thai hot was hot but not crazy hot.  We also had a nice spring rolls appetizer that was very good as well.  For the price, portions, and taste, this place was terrific."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food with a relaxing atmosphere.  I have spent considerable amount in Thailand and have first hand knowledge of the tastes of Thai food.  The staff is very welcoming too!  This was my fave lunch spot when I was working in Tempe.

{"text":"I had a random craving for something new today and since I recently moved out to the East Valley it was easy to find something. My boyfriend and I settled on Thai. We got the honey chicken and classic curry. The honey chicken, which I anticipated to be my favorite, was actually the lesser of the two. Which, in this case, is a compliment. I'd never had curry before and I was a little weary when my boyfriend brought the take-out to the car and I saw the yellowish color BUT it was SO good! The spices were perfect (or at least perfect to me, no reference point..) with a good amount of heat (medium). I will definitely be coming back here as it's near my house! I'm excited to try more of the menu.
Oh, it's very reasonably priced, as well! Try it!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place from reading all the reviews. The place is very small, I think I counted 6 tables. It is more of a carry out restaurant. The service was very good. The lady there was attentive and very friendly. Now the food. It was just okay. We ordered the mussaman curry, the pad Thai and the classic curry. The meat used in the mussaman curry was not tender and I don't think it was short ribs it tasted like bottom round. The meat was kind of tough. The pad Thai was really too sweet and it was soupy. It was like I was eating pad Thai soup. I didn't like the taste of it at all. The classic curry was good. Everything comes out on plastic plates and bowls. I'm not sure if we will come back. If you really want great Thai food head over to Malees on Main or Thai Basil."}
{"text":"The food is good in quality and quantity for its price. It will not he the best Thai food you ever had, but it is a nice lunch choice for your workdays."}
{"text":"Yummy Food!

Super friendly staff greet with genuine friendliness. 

Prices are very affordable!

The pad si ew was 4 out of 5 stars wonderfully moist and tasty. 9 out of 10 spicy was just right. Good sized portions make me happy too! Only $8 for a nice plate!

Massaman Curry was a 5 out of 5 stars delicious dish! Only $10 for a nice big plate!

Thai tea is good! The big size is awesome huge!

The interior was clean and organized. 

The bathroom was clean.

I will definitely want to come back here again!"}
{"text":"I have always had a good experience at this place. For the past two times, they have mixed up my orders. 

I ordered a Kang Dang mild with chicken, I got Kang Dang with shrimp and extremely hot. I could see the red chilies floating in the sauce. 

I walked to the store to change my order. I got a Kang Dang with chicken but hot again with uncooked vegetables. 

I am so disappointed. I loved this place and it was my to go place for this food. Ingredients are fresh and food is well made usually. 

She did not offer any refund or no apologies. 

I won't go there again. 

Check and taste your take out before going home."}
{"text":"I have been struggling finding good Thai in Tempe since my move from Chicago. 

This is the best Thai food I've ever had in Tempe!! I ordered fried bananas and ice cream, vegetarian pad Thai and crab rangoon. The total was $21.63 I would say that's a great deal for the portions and quality! 

I got the pad Thai medium spice which was the perfect amount of hot. Giving my tongue a little kick but not overwhelming.  The pad Thai can also come as vegan! 

I enjoyed that the fried bananas were egg roll style. Very unique and flavorful with honey drizzled on top.  

The crab Rangoon came with a little salad, the dressing is a little thick for me not exactly sure what it is.  The sweet and sour sauce for the Rangoons is so tangy I found it to be a perfect pairing. The Rangoons are very full and do not have a super fried taste. One of my favs for sure!!

I would 10/10 recommend this place. It is my go to in Tempe!!"}
{"text":"It's a fast food type place.  The waiter screwed up my order.  I would say the food is just \"ok\".  There's nothing wrong with it but I wouldn't say it's special."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Billy Joel - River Of Dreams)

At Sa Bai On The Fly
I go eating with my friends
From the curry with spice
To the fried rice no meat

I must be Yelping for something
Something tasty I hope
And Sa Bai On The Fly
And its too good to pass


Sa Bai On The Fly is a smaller and quicker version of Sa Bai in PHX.  I enjoyed their original location so I had to come and check out their new spot.

The place itself is definitely and pickup and delivery place, but they still had tables and chairs, but not a whole lot!  I came with some friends and they ordered their fried rice with shrimp while I went for the Avocado Curry with chicken.  The interesting thing about their fried rice was it came with dried cranberries and cashews which I really enjoyed.  It help provided a sweet and crunchy texture.  My avocado curry was different, but it worked.  The creamy smoothness of the curry mixed with carrots, onions, basils, and some avocado slices atop; was a perfect balance of texture and spices!  I didn't really care for the rice it was served with cause I felt it was overcooked and bit crunchy.  Maybe I got the bottom of the barrel on that part.

Overall, the place didn't really look at that great, but their food here does the speaking.  I understand it's a pickup joint, but being served on paper plates and plastic water cups was a little too picnic-like. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Met up with friend for dinner, placed picked was Sa Bai On The Fly.   Sa Bai is kind of like if Thai food could be fast food, this would be it, you walk in, place your order and wait for it at a table and it is brought out to you.  Easy peasy! 

I went with my favorite and ordered the massaman curry with chicken and Thai Hot, the curry had great flavor and perfect texture, the chicken was tender and the potatoes cooked perfectly, this was a great tasting bowl of curry, the only thing that could have been better was it could have been a tab bit spicier for me, but that's really not a big thing.

Glad I found this little spot for the night's I'm in the mood for Thai and just want to order to go. Look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered from Sa Bai online via DoorDash and asked for the avocado curry without the chicken. They have a specific box you can select that says \"No Meat\" for that curry (not an option for some of the other dishes). The curry arrived laden with chicken. I had also ordered $10 worth of drinks that didn't arrive because the restaurant was out of cups. They told the delivery driver they'd refund my account but after 2 days I saw nothing so I had to go through DoorDash to get the refund (which they processed that day).

On the plus side the spicy fried rice was good, but I was not overly impressed with the spicy noodle dish with tofu, which had no flavour. My quest for decent Thai food in Tempe shall continue."}
{"text":"Got some takeout for lunch here today. Ordered it online and it worked out well. Had the Jalapeno Curry....and it was amazing. Ordered it hot. It was not overwhelming, ended up adding a little chili paste to it to kick it up a bit. The flavor profile was perfect. Perfectly cooked  vegetables with beef in a green coconut curry sauce. Staff was really nice and it was ready when they said it would be. Putting this restaurant in the \"keeper\" column. Go there. You will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Let me preference this by saying I'm super picky about Pad Thai. It is my favorite noodle dish of all time, therefore, I have some pretty hefty requirements out of love for the dish. This restaurant serves up the BEST in town. Most importantly, the flavors are rich and developed. The portion is generous and well priced-can I get a hell yeah? Plus, they're really fast at getting orders out. Lastly, coming here makes me feel good. Spending money at a small bistro versus a large chain is way better for our local economy."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their crab wantons are to die for. Pad Thai is really good. Their employees are very sweet. I've ordered delivery from them twice and loved it every time. It's my go to Thai place. Even when I'm not in the mood and I see them I still have to say that I love them every time."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai at its best.  Although a take out place as sit in area is small and not decorated to be a proper sit in restaurant, I will tell you the food makes up for it.  The pineapple fried rice, the chicken mint salad, the chicken salad wrap ( i have
Not had this did since my last visit to Bangkok over a decade ago), advocado curry  and lad nar are my absolute favorites.  The open kitchen allows you to see their pristine cleanliness the Thais are well known for."}
{"text":"It's OK, but not great. Maybe a 2.5 instead of a three.

A group of us went for lunch. A variety of entrees were ordered, all so-so. I had a dish with beef, others ordered pad Thai, a salad, satay, lettuce wraps. Bottom line, the peanut sauce was heavy on the corn starch. This, of course, effected many of the dishes. Was not a true sauce. Was asked how spicy I wanted my dish. I choose medium. It was less than mild. 

The lettuce wraps were decent, good enough to eat! But it was not memorable. The satay was decent enough. Again the peanut sauce made it so-so. The others' pad Thai looked a bit strange. I asked how it was and was told it was OK, but I do not know how much of that response was being polite.

There is not much room here. Maybe seats around 30 max. 

Service was good. Prices were reasonable.


5* = A top favorite. Mind-blowing good. I will definitely return and I will go out of my way to go here. Worth every dime of my money.
4* = Outstanding. Tucson-top-tier. Some elements not quite as good as it gets, but it still is worthy of my regular business.
3* = Good experience. I might do repeat business if it is convenient, the only option, the only one in its category, or on a whim, but would not be among the first thing to come to mind. Would definitely recommend you trying it to get your own take on it.
2* = Not so good. Would not recommend at all. Waste of money.
1* = How are they still in business? Stay away at all costs!"}
{"text":"YUM YUM! Only complaint is that I wish they had a happy hour."}
{"text":"Came in with a friend who recommended this place. Coming in the service was really good the lady at the counter instantly began to clean up a table for us. We ordered our food and the prices are really fair especially for the big portions they give you! We got our food really fast and it's really delicious! I would recommend this place to anyone, it is small so no big groups probably but nonetheless it's a 5 star place!"}
{"text":"This place was fine for a quick dinner, the pad Thai was sub par or average at best but the pad pri king was delicious. Crab wontons were pretty good as well. Service was fine you order at a counter and they bring it to you on disposable plates. They brought it out extremely fast. 
While we were sitting there a man came in and bought headphones from the counter. They spent awhile discussing price and the employee called people on her phone to check on the price. It was odd. W
Overall, if we want pad Thai we'll go elsewhere but if we want a quick stir fry type dinner then we'll definitely swing by here for pick up. Not much seating inside"}
{"text":"We've been to the Tempe location twice before, long time ago, and we loved their food. However, today's take out was a disappointment. The curry dish was RELATIVELY good (though it had few veggies in it), but the spicy rice noodles were very not good. They tasted somewhat old and lacked flavor, and there were 4 pieces of broccoli, a few pieces of meat, and 3 slices of carrot. This made me not want to come back to this location any more. I'm sorry, I don't like leaving a bad review, but it is not alright to serve something like this to customers."}
{"text":"Great staff and decent food. My friends had their baby along with them and the whole staff loved playing with him. Not the best Thai food I've ever had but not bad."}
{"text":"Super delicious Thai food! The medium is pretty spicy so if you can't handle spice I would get your plate mild! This place is well known for their curry but I actually really enjoyed their pad Thai! My boyfriend had the avocado curry and he wasn't a fan. However, the chili oil that you can order on the side is something else! Super delicious!"}
{"text":"Pros:
Doesn't exactly taste bad. Portions are okay.
Cons:
The curry is too thin and too liquefied, if that makes sense. The food is served on paper plates with plastic utensils. 

The food is way too overpriced considering it comes off as a fast food Thai place. Overall, I've had much better Thai food for less."}
{"text":"Very very tasty Thai cooked/served here! Not a super-great dining-in type experience, as it offers less than 10 tables in a tiny area. Typical restaurant-in-a-plaza atmosphere. 

Don't expect them to serve your food on any type of ceramic plates either. They use paper plates - period.

If you're okay with looking past this, brace yourself for the food. It's very obvious they cook to order and only use very fresh vegetables, ingredients, and authentic spices. 

My 2 aunts, mom and myself ate family style ordering:

Cashew Chicken
Eggplant something-or-other
Pad Thai (Chicken)
Spring Rolls (appetizer)

Even had good portion size of leftovers after 4 hungry women plowed thru the Thai plates. Total of damage done on bill? Like $30 or $31!! I'd say that's pretty cheap - you can go ahead and do the math on your own. :)

**CAUTION: We ordered a hotness of \"3\" on all dishes. A \"3\" is pretty spicy, guys... It was a tad uncomfortable, causing me to furiously ram white rice in my mouth to extinguish such fire, as the water just spread pure pain. Nose and eyes ran to further call out attention to others that I'm a p*$$y. If I had a time machine, I would have requested a 2.5 or a 2.75. Don't try to be a hero/tough guy and ruin a perfectly good meal. 

I do find it odd that they don't have disposable serving spoons/forks for family-style tables; we had to use our flimsy, plastic utensils. Pshhh. That's just lame sauce. With coconut milk."}
{"text":"When I moved away from the Phoenix location I was so sad to leave my favorite Thai restaurant. Then they opened in Tempe! The food at this location lives up to standards set at the other in a somewhat more casual environment. Sa Bai never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, great price, and great service. Would highly recommend!
Place was also very clean"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery around 1:50 PM on a Monday and it was being delivered within 10 minutes! The food was great-spicy basil shrimp stir fry- and the service was quick. Will definitely order out again."}
{"text":"I trusted the reviews and they did not lie.    It's a nice small clean and quick eat-in or take-out place.  Don't expect silverware (just plastic) but the service was very friendly and fast.  I tried the jalapeño curry as I had never seen this on a Thai menu before....delicious with the perfect amount of spice to make my eyes water at medium.  Food is very fresh tasting, especially the large variety of veggies in my order.  Also, each entree comes with a small lettuce/cabbage/carrot salad with tasty peanut dressing - yum, perfect way to cool off the spice if it gets too intense."}
{"text":"I checked this place out today and was pleasantly surprised by both their prices and the quality of the food. 

I had the Laarb Kai, which if you haven't ventured out enough outside of the traditional pad Thai or curry dishes you should definitely give it a try. It's basically an amazing salad with minced chicken and it's nice and citrusy and spicy and just plain delicious. 

I am definitely going to stop back on through to try some more items."}
{"text":"This is our go to Thai place! The service is quick and easy  and every time we come in we are nicely greeted. The food is amazing and the portions are quite larger."}
{"text":"Really close to where I live on campus, so this quick takeout place is very convenient. I got the avocado curry (mild). For those of you who can't handle the heat I would definitely say no spice at all because mine was pretty hot, but it was still really tasty. I also ordered the beef pad see ew which was a little on the sweet side but the portions were pretty hefty."}
{"text":"Went to Sa Bai for the first time almost a year ago when they were newer with a friend, and it's been mine and my boyfriend's go-to place for Thai food since! Compared to some of the other Thai places I've been to in the area, I've found I like Sa Bai the best due to the flavor of their dishes and the speed of the restaurant. There aren't too many places to sit if you do dine-in, but if you're looking to call in or order online to pick up it's a great, fast option. Their spicy pad Thai is my favorite in the area and their kang dang curry has a great amount of spice and flavor as well. Their spring rolls weren't my absolute favorite, but everything else has been great so far! Great option for Thai food if you're in the area, fast, good quality food for decent prices!

Edit: Found a couple short hairs (definitely not mine) in my pad Thai one time when we ordered takeout...yuck."}
{"text":"Fast service. The food was pretty good overall . Definitely will return for more grub."}
{"text":"Had the pad thai tonight, delivered. Asked for medium and there was no spice at all. Soooooo bland absolutely no flavor and was an ugly color of grey and the chicken was rubbery. So disappointed and waste of money."}
{"text":"Horrible Pad Thai that smelled and tasted awful. The sauce was ALL wrong! Massamun curry had a decent flavor, but the beef was SUPER chewy! Chicken satay was good,  as was the accompanying peanut sauce and cucumber salad. 

I'm not coming back here."}
{"text":"Get the fried rice! It has all kinds of goodies in it including pineapple, cranberries and cashews. I got it with tofu and it was perfect. I wavered between that and a noodle dish and was not disappointed. Friendly and totally informal. I would take out from here all the time if I lived nearby.  So far, Arizona has not disappointed at all thanks to relying on Yelp!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed after seeing many great reviews. I was told to take a seat, then completely ignored and ended up leaving before placing an order. Unfortunately the avocado curry was not worth the poor service."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome customer service. Must try the Crab Wontons! The Pad-See- Ew is my personal fave."}
{"text":"This place is so good ! And the people are very nice . I'm picky when it comes to Thai food and this place is perfect . And when you ask for hot , you get hot . The beef is so tender and flavorful . They give you ALOT of shrimp in the shrimp fried rice . They're the big juicy shrimp too . I could go on and on. I'll definitely be back ."}
{"text":"Sa Bai just opened not too long ago so I was a bit nervous to give it a shot. I go to Dunkin Donuts right next door pretty often and whenever I pass by Sa Bai it's always busy. I also read reviews that the portions were large so I finally caved and picked up some Thai tonight.

The restaurant itself was clean and well-kept. It's a bit small but nice atmosphere. The woman at the register was very nice and offered me anything I might need. And the food...

It was phenomenal - the portions are very large (when they first gave me my order I thought they accidentally gave me something extra). I had the Classic Curry and Thai Rolls. I chose Medium for my level of spicy and it was a bit spicier than expected. But, I'm full nonetheless and will definitely be stopping by more often!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The avocado curry is truly unique and delicious. The staff is friendly and inviting, even though we mostly order delivery the restaurant is clean, but a little small. They have completely taken me away from the Tempe Thai Basil, which is sad because they even knew me by name there, did I mention I love Thai food... It's sad when the owner recognizes your phone number and says \"hello Mr Freeman\""}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Very realistic Thai food from a family who is from Thailand. They are really courteous, friendly, and give excellent service. Plus the portions are a really good size as well. Other random thing that makes me happy here is that on the menu it shows all the meals pricing includes tax so it all comes out even."}
{"text":"Sa Bai On The Fly- Oh My! On this dreary cold day I was in a spicy curry mood, and seeing all the great reviews for this restaurant piqued my interest in wanting to try it out. I ordered an avocado curry ($10) and Thai eggplant ($8). On the phone I was only offered \"mild\" or \"medium\" options of spiciness. Kind of odd, do they really not make things \"hot\" spicy? I went with the medium level and my order would be ready for pick up in 20 minutes.

The order was ready right on time and packaged very well. It smelled amazing in the car, and it was a huge portion of food for each dish. The avocado dish is a jazzed up green curry with the addition of sliced and chunk avocados to the mixture of chicken, basil, and other vegetables. I think it was a good \"medium\" level of spiciness, just enough spice to let you know it was there without the need for a fire hydrant's worth of water afterwards. The Thai eggplant was a hefty portion of pork, eggplant, and other veggies and was more delicate tasting than the bold curry.

The space inside the restaurant is nicely decorated but very tiny. In addition to ordering by phone, you can also order online through their website.

Overall, I'd definitely be interested in coming here again to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Great pad Thai! This is right by my house and the owners are really nice and friendly. I originally thought $2.75 is quite expensive for a soda filled mostly with ice. But the waitress kept refilling me since we were there when it was slower. 

I enjoyed the food! Nice and clean location"}
{"text":"Ordered Pad Thai delivery through Doordash. I am used to savory Pad Thai not so sweet that I feel like I am eating dessert. A big turn off that I am not finishing my meal and throwing it away. I judge a place on the Pad Thai if it's my first time trying a place based on this trying somewhere else."}
{"text":"Excellent flavor and great value. This is now my favorite new Thai food restaurant in Tempe! Would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends and family."}
{"text":"This has to be some of the best Thai food I've ever had! I ordered the Crispy Thai Rolls, the Kang Dang Curry and the Cashew Chicken. Everything was so delicious. I ordered the curry with no spice and it still had an awesome kick to it. The shrimp and all the veggies were cooked perfectly and the pineapple added an unexpected but delicious sweetness. The Thai rolls came with a nice little side salad with a peanut sauce. When we picked up the food the lady at the counter was extremely friendly and gave us two Thai teas to go. I'll definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Sa Bai on the Fly served me my first taste of Thai food. Either Thai food itself inherently is cheap, delicious, and nuanced, or this restaurant is excellent. Based on the fact that people still eat non-Thai food all the time, I'm going to assume the latter.

I ordered the avocado curry for about $10. It came hot, well-spiced for a \"medium spicyness\" dish, and was large and satisfying. Although I am no food critic, it had what I can only call depth of flavor. It was multilayered and unique. I wish I could describe the experience better, but, unfortunately, I don't know how to describe food very well. There was plenty of chicken, the avocado was tastefully present, the sauce was fluid and thick, and it all harmonized well in my mouth, making me let out a little sigh of satisfaction after the first bite.

I would have happily paid about  $20 for my meal, hence the 5 stars. The staff was attentive, polite, and helpful, much better than average. 

Bear in mind that this was my first exposure to Thai food. Many of the ingredients and spices may have been new to me, so, to someone more accustomed to Thai, perhaps curry like this is the norm. All I know is that it was delicious and cheap, and that I'll be back."}
{"text":"The yellow curry was fragrant and amazingly flavorful-- the best one I've tried so far! The salad and spicy peanut dressing are definitely worth having, and I appreciate their awesome selection of desserts on the menu. Overall, an inviting place to eat with very memorable food!

We are lucky to have them in this area :)"}
{"text":"Terrible tasting food. 
Ordered curry and got soggy veggies and totally wrong flavor. 

On the bright side, service was good despite the poor tasting food."}
{"text":"Picked up lunch from here and wow! The pad Thai was perfect and the crab wontons are made with real crab and taste like real crab. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"wish it was more consistent. This place has literally served me the best and worst pad Thai  I've had in years. When it's good it is GOOD. This last time was tasteless practically sauceless noodles. Not a first time occasion unfortunately."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE experience... I am vegetarian so I ordered avocado curry with tofu. I picked up the food and when home only to realize that it had chicken in it. I called to let them know it had chicken so they agreed to make another curry for me.. Again when I came home to eat dinner -the tofu was cold inside, the vegetables were solid rock and cold and there was NO avocado to be found in my curry and the curry itself was runny and watery.... When I called to let them know - the guy who answered said \"Sorry ma'am but it happens\"... So I basically spent money on food I trashed... Disappointed and angry... Do no go here for a good dinner experience..."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pad Thai and the Crunchy Thai Rolls to go, over the phone. It was ready when I arrived and paid about $15. 

You get a lot of pad thai for what you pay for, but hardly any flavor. At best I would say it mildly tastes like what I am used to. Somewhat disappointed that by the time I got back to my office the noodles were all stuck together and the sauce was at the bottom.However the rolls were extremely delicious. You get 5 rolls, I was only expecting 3. 

I might come back in the future. The Avocado Curry looks intriguing. I would not recommend this to a friend."}
{"text":"Delicious. Fresh. These guys know how to do spicy! Friendly service and great price. Definitely a must."}
{"text":"I had the pad see ew with beef. They give you a generous amount of beef! I also had a Thai iced coffee. Nice & strong! Their water is infused with cucumber. Very delicious & refreshing. The lady at the counter is very nice & hospitable. The water is at a self serve station, but she walked from behind the counter to my table to ask me if I wanted water. Wonderful service. The playlist is also good! Early 2000s hits playing through the speakers."}
{"text":"great thai food and excellent customer service I highly recommend said bai on the fly to everyone"}
{"text":"This place was delicious & very reasonably priced. I got the Thai Eggplant, which had A LOT of veggies (YUM!) and my boyfriend got the avocado curry. As an appetizer, we got the Spring Rolls and the side salad it came with had the tastiest peanut sauce dressing. Must try if you're in Tempe! Only negative: they use biodegradable plates & bowls, but it goes straight into a plastic bag, which then serves ultimately no good for the environment. For those eating in, real plates and utensils ADDS to the experience."}
{"text":"Have had this place bookmarked for awhile and finally got to try it! I guess I was a little bit irked by the server's first comment to us. \"Dining in or take out? Are you paying in cash or card?\" We were dining in...and I didn't have cash. But my girlfriend did, but I was taking her out and wanted to pay. The server told us it'd be fine if we only had card, just that it would be easier ( more convenient for him ) if we paid in cash. That rubbed me the wrong way...in my opinion, not very professional and frankly, irrelevant because they still could've accepted card no problem...it was bizarre. He didn't ask the next party that came in if they were paying cash/card. Anyways, I've spent too much time talking about this. 

Moving onto food...

Veg egg roll - 5/5 these were yummy. Get them if you like egg rolls. 

Yellow curry with tofu - 4/5 good flavor, but a little too thick and dense. Flavor was good, a bit sweet. Could use more variety of vegetables rather than just a crap ton of onions. 

Pad see ew - 1/5 I was super disappointed. Noodles were EXTREMELY greasy. And very clumped together...didn't have the traditional dish flavor at all.


Would I come back? Yeah, probably for the curry and apps. Not for any noodle dish. And I agree with other reviews...not into the disposable dishes. What a waste and terrible for the environment!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times when I worked in the area. Great food & even better service! 

I've tried the Pad See Iew, Pad Thai w/chicken and the Basil. Each dish was WONDERFUL. I had some Crispy Thai Rolls, too. Also, very good.

I've yet to venture out and try anything w/curry, but my friend tried the Avocado Curry once and it looked SO good. I will have to give that a try next time.

I don't live nearby, but I would make the drive for some great Thai food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Had a huge hankering for Thai food after a massive workout and needed it quickly otherwise my hangri-ness would appear. Luckily Sa Bai is on the way home and while scrolling thru their menu appeared to have a variety of Thai offerings!  Their space is very small [not suggested for more than a few people to dine-in, not suggested for groups] but super clean, it looks and feels like they just opened. The cashier was super nice and gave some suggestions for his faves on the menu. I went with my standard Pad Thai and normal spiciness. I was super surprised/impressed that it only took a few minutes for my to-go order to be ready for me. But their name implies quick service, and that's what I received.

There was an odd twinge of sweetness to the Pad Thai that I'd never tasted before in other Pad Thai, that I tasted with Sa Bai's version. It and the (lack of) spiciness I was expecting was just weird and underwhelming. Not sure how Pad Thai can be sweet and not really spicy at all. I ate the entire thing because I didn't really have anything else to eat for dinner, and wish there was more chicken in the Pad Thai. Haven't decided if I'll go back and try something else because I don't eat a lot of other Thai food."}
{"text":"This casual Thai restaurant is clean, inexpensive, and authentic. The food comes out quickly, and everything we ordered was flavorful."}
{"text":"The main reason this place gets 5 stars is that when I ask for really spicy, they give some really spicy curry.

In all seriousness, this place is legit. Though it's a take out restaurant, they filled it up with my group of 18. The service was good and the food even better. The portions are well worth the cost $10 dollars will give you two meals if you have a small stomach. 

Again, the most impressive thing about this restaurant is that when you ask for their hottest, they give you their hottest. I haven't experienced that hot thai food in a  while. I feel most Thai foods, and asian foods in general go light on spice but I give them applause for bringing the heat."}
{"text":"Just discovered this gem. I had the spicy Coco soup (YUMMY!!!) and the Chicken Pad Thai (also very tasty!) prices are very reasonable for this level of Thai food, and the owners are super nice."}
{"text":"I went for a business meeting so I'm sorry I didn't snap a picture.

The place was very clean. You can see through to the cooking area and it was really clean. I go to many places to eat out due to my work and meeting clients. This place showed they make an effort to provide great service.

The lady taking my order and the guy cooking are as authentic Asian as you can get in that their English seemed limited. Be nice and remember we have no official language in the US. Nothing was screwed up in the order. Super nice order taker.

Food was amazing. I got the original curry and it was really great. Way tasty!  It was only $8.00 and for the amount and the table service, it was worth it. I said \"table service\" because it's like a carry-out place with tables but the cashier was very attentive and when no one was at the register she was refilling drinks. A guy in our party was drinking water. We were seated right by the water dispenser. She still came and filled his cup.

Food was fast and tasted great. I would strongly recommend this place. Very nice people."}
{"text":"We ordered the Beef Massaman curry that came with rice and the Chicken Pad see ew (drunken noodle). With Thai tea that is $3 for the regular size and $5 for the large.

The prices are affordable! All the entrees were mostly under $10, can't beat that.

They also do take out and delivery.

Everyone was really friendly, I think the lady that took our order was the owner. She was very attentive to make sure we enjoyed our food.

I asked for a 8 out of 10 spice and I barely even tasted any! So i guess I'll ask for a 10 next time."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for Thai...

The jalapeno curry is fantastic! All of the veggies they use taste fresh and are cooked to a perfect texture.

I've also ordered the pad see-iew here, and although I feel I've had better from other restaurants it was still quite good. Again, the vegetables in the dish were the standouts.

I can't wait to try all the other dishes..."}
{"text":"I've never reviewed anything on Yelp, but Sa Bai is worth making an account for! I just came here for the first time with my boyfriend and roommate, and the food and service were amazing! I got the avocado curry, which was delicious. It was creamy and just the right size portion. Nothing on the menu was more than $10, which is also a huge plus. 

Pia came out to talk to our table and she was so sweet. She learned all of our names, and brought us out a free lemonade since it was our first time there. It was the best customer service that I have gotten in a very long time! I would absolutely recommend Sa Bai and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great spot! The dishes are packed with flavor and love. Made with fresh ingredients.  Atmosphere is chill, awesome music playing overhead! Not loud but enough to bounce to."}
{"text":"Very clean environment, polite with good service. Easy to read the menu so you don't get confuse. Avocado curry is delicious, best Thai food in Tempe. A must try give them a shot you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is clean, quick, cheap and delicious. I get the jalapeño curry every time. A really delicious take on classic green curry!"}
{"text":"The tofu was amazing an you guys made it spicy how I like it, the spring rolls are off the chain. Keep up the good work I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sitting here with a bowl of the Avocado Curry, delicious!  The lettuce wraps were also great, and the staff is friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Look at all the reviews in the last 2-3 months (writing this June 2018). This place has gone downhill FAST. I used to get take-out here multiple times a month for the last year, and as of a week ago I won't be going again."}
{"text":"This might well be the best Thai food I have ever had! Truly scrumptious!! Special of the house today was the pumpkin curry and it delivered on flavor. Creamy pumpkin, squash, carrots, and crisp green beans over perfectly cooked rice. I added tofu - great addition, though you could do another protein. The salad with peanut dressing is on the thicker side - still quite good. Hubby had the Sa Bai fried rice, loaded with chicken, veggies, and cashews - loved the craisins involved in all that yum. We'll be back for sure - friendly, clean, and delicious."}
{"text":"Whoo hoo! Authentic, affordable, tasty Thai food! The owner Holly cooks the best spicy noodles with tons of flavor and character. That totally describes this cool concept restaurant with multiple locations in Phoenix. Sa Bai offers a healthy variety of menu items and drink choices, always served with consistent welcoming friendliness and smiles. The hours are great, the decor is relaxing, and you easily feel welcomed to stay and enjoy your meal. It's just what \"Sa Bai\" means, as described by the history and story of the restaurant's beginnings. I would highly recommend this spot! And, if you order noodles and don't eat egg, make sure to mention that too! This is a fun, casual and easy going spot with out any pressure to order tons of food (appetizers, meals, drinks and everything else). The portion sizes are really generous and the staff make sure to check in with you just to make sure you are a happy camper, Thai style!"}
{"text":"I got the pad-seew and it was really good! I love the sauce and the chewy-ness that the noodles have. It is pretty similar to drunken noodles. Their Tom Yum soup is very flavorful. The prices are not bad, it is like every other Thai place. The inside of the location is quite small. They serve your food on a paper plate/disposable plate, which I do not like. I think it is very wasteful to the economy and the fact that paper is touching my food."}
