{"text":"This is a small family owned restaurant serving delicious Salvadoran food. The popusas are top notch and the agua de ensalada is refreshing. I recommend the carne asada plate with shrimp. It's a huge plate of food and the best part is that it's about $19!   I think the reviewer who gave this place three stars is being mean spirited and just wants to throw dirt at this place."}
{"text":"Best popusas I ever had  They also have Mexican dishes great carne azada  I recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"I am in love with this restaurant! I'm from the south of Mexico (Veracruz to be exact) and the food reminded me so much of back home. The platanos fritos with black beans are amazing and the corn tamales are on point! Thank God for this place and lucky me its just across from where I live! Lol"}
{"text":"Amazing place and vary reasonable price, the food was excellent. Pupusas were very delicious,and bistec encebollado and my husband got the plato típico and it looked vary good. And employees were vary nice."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst pupusa i have ever tasted.  The place had a weird smell it. I knew i should of left when i saw no one was here for lunch. The waiter couldn't speak clearly and wasn't friendly  There was no wow factor.  The plate of food was served on a weird plate fish shaped The pupusa was under cooked which is frightening since there was nobody else in the restaurant to eat lunch at a particular time.  Hate to see how the food turns out when is busy.  If they can't make a simple cheese pupusa! Don't try the rest of the food my opinion.  Really disappointed overall Even the menu look like an amateur hour."}
{"text":"La comida esta deliciosa! Todo está recién hecho y La verdura esta fresca. El restaurante está limpio y el servicio es excelente! Definitivamente recomiendo el restaurante salvadoreño Gladys. El mesero Willi es muy atentó y amable. Gracias"}
{"text":"WOW!!! I wish I could give this place 10 stars. We had an amazing meal here. The pupusas  are outstanding (double the size of pupusas served at other restaurants)! Portions are HUGE! Seriously, enough for more than one meal. Excellent service! The young guy who serves and works the register was SO nice. He made us feel really welcome and answered all our questions. I tried the Mexican pupusa (jalapenos and cheese), queso and lorroco pupusa (lorroco has a mild broccoli taste), and the queso con frijol pupusa. Out of all three the queso con frijol pupusa was my favorite (just cheesy deliciousness).     This is definitely the best authentic Salvadorian food I have tried in the Valley. Will be back with the family!"}
{"text":"The wife and I can out here. Fairly reasonable and the food is authentic as can be. Bomb.com"}
{"text":"This place in my opinion has some of the best pupusas I have ever tasted they are not greedy with their ingredients they are well stuffed and they are delicious.  I recommend it and I will for sure be returning again."}
{"text":"Seen the reviews for this restaurant and I just had to go check it out for myself! Let me just say the pupusas are amazing! Glady's will be my place for when I'm craving authentic Salvadorian food. Nice to know there's a great place in Mesa, Keep up the YUMMY WORK!"}
{"text":"Wow! We were on our way out for dinner somewhere else when we passed by then decided to turn around and try it out. Glad we did! The waiter was very nice and answered all of our questions since this was our first time trying Salvadorian food.  My husband and I ordered the Carne asada & camarones (shrimp). Our children ordered the bean/cheese papusas and cheese/flour? Papusas.  The carne asada and shrimp plate was large (could've shared 1 plate with my husband)! It came with beans, rice, salad, limes & tortillas. Squeezed the lime all over my rice, salad and carne asada. It was delicious!! The salad was really fresh too! My husband wasn't sure about the shrimp since its served with the shrimp head, but he tried it & immediately changed his mind!  The papusas were large and flavorful.  It was served with a red sauce and slaw.   My son ordered an Horchata and didn't like it, but he was warned by the waiter ahead of ordering, that it was different from a Mexican Horchata. I tried it and thought it was good. I ordered water, which they bring out a cup of ice and a bottled water.  The only bad thing about all this....we are only visiting...we live in Maryland!!!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! This was a very nice treat on my business trip here to Arizona. The waiter was absolutely the best. Kind and explained what items were to us. The food was delicious and HUGE portions. I hated not taking the leftovers because of staying in a hotel because it was delicious. I highly recommend !!!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing and the pupusas' were even better... we showed up right before closing and then still welcomed up in and offered us a table to enjoy a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"My sister and I enjoyed so much food: Pupusas: queso, queso & frijoles, revulta Platanos fritos  Frijole & arroz Tamale de pollo Empanada  Horchata  All of it was authentic El Salvador!   Great portions!  The service was good and friendly! It was busy on Friday night... always a good sign! But we were still able to get a table quickly.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Not very thrilled. I was excited to try the pupusas! Being from the neighboring country of Honduras we share the love for pupusas.   I like to ask before I order what type of cheese they use. From previous experiences in other places. Pupusas should be made with quesillo that's how you know they are \"authentic\" when I was about to order I also asked what type of cheese and was told they were made with mozzarella cheese. My heart was a bit crushed, but still ordered. The pupusas were decent."}
{"text":"Pupusa? Maduros? Fried Yucca? Yes please! If you aren't familiar with Salvadorean food I highly recommend that you change that ASAP by stopping by Glady's. Pupusas are very similar to quesadillas in that you have a tortilla like wrapper surrounding cheese and other fillings. Unlike quesadillas however, the outer layer is a little thicker and fluffier, and they are served with curtido (think lightly pickled slaw) and a very mild salsa (most food south of Mexico isn't spicy). The pupusas at Glady's are on point and HUGE! My family ordered 3 as a side and we could have easily eaten the three as our main meal. Each pupusa measures about 6 inches in diameter and is cooked perfectly. We also ordered a beefsteak plate and fried plantains. We visited on a Sunday morning (brunch hour) and the place was packed. Service was a little slow but I'm sure t had to do with the volume of clientele. I love this mom and pop joint and will definitely pay a return visit!"}
{"text":"First time coming I enjoyed the way my order was taken. The food was well presented the servings were more than enough to feed two people. Overall will gladly come again with my family."}
{"text":"Wow this place was poppin! We stopped by on Sunday at 1:30pm and the line was literally starting to come out the door. We stood behind another party that had just walked in, so we waited a few minutes to get in.   The inside is small. VERY SMALL. If you hate being indoors with a bunch of people or if you're just claustrophobic this is not the place for you. They don't have that many tables and the setup inside is just weird. They do have chairs along the side for people to sit at and wait to be seated.   We were luckily seated right away at the table that's right in front of the door when you walk in. The server was VERY FRIENDLY and he dropped us off the menus. More people kept walking in so it got even crazier and loud inside.   They don't have as many dishes as other pupuserias have, and they are limited on the different kinds of pupusas. The menu is small and the drinks are not listed on there.   We decided on going for the plate of the fried plantains that come with beans and sour cream. We also got two orders of their 3 pupusas plate that come with a drink, rice, and beans. We ordered two pupusas revueltas and four chicharron con queso.   Our food came out rather quickly. The fried plantains were unfortunately burnt :( our pupusas were very mushy for some reason and we could barely find any chicharron in them. The salsa for the pupusas was super watered down and so I felt like I was putting water on my pupusas.   The rice that came with my food had no flavor and it tasted like boxed rice. The black beans were delicious though, so I found myself eating them all!   My tamarind drink was also very good and not too sweet. We asked for water and a water bottle was brought out to us. They don't have any of their drinks listed, so we had no idea the water wasn't free like at any other establishment..  The sever was nice but the food was ehhh... the place inside is crazy small and it was very hot inside! People were sweating and even my shirt was wet after being there a little over an hour... please turn on the AC."}
{"text":"Ok, so I found this place by mistake but you probably already know that nothing happens by accident. It was late and I was hungry. I saw this restaurant on the corner and the open sign was still on. I went in and they were about to close but graciously asked me what I wanted to order. I quickly looked through the menu and found the Pupusas. I ended up ordering  the one with just pork, a combo of beans and cheese, and a third with beans cheese and pork. The owner, Willy was so friendly and very accommodating. I also got a chance to taste their Tamales with chicken. Very tasty indeed! The atmosphere is great and very colorful! The menu has lots of great items including amazing breakfasts. I will be back for sure! Very nice owners, and it's a family owned restaurant so they really care about their food quality as well. Wonderful place I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever tried Salvadorian food, but oh my goodness it was amazing! I can't stress enough how good the food was, and the staff was so friendly! They went out of their way to make this a wonderful experience! I'll definitely be coming back here many times in the future! The restaurant was authentic and decorated with a wonderful interior."}
{"text":"So good, spent grandma's birthday here and they treated her like the princess she is. At 88 years old she claims this was her best birthday in years because of the delicious food, great waiter and family-friendly atmosphere. Horchata was super good, some places mess up on that drink but here they got it all right!!"}
{"text":"I moved from Cali, so its been hard finding a good pupusa place, this place I thought was good..or at least the first pupusa I ate. I ordered a queso y chicharrón  and it was so good! What disappointed me was the other pupusa I ordered which was the traditional Revuelta. Now this was NOT a good pupusa because the beans were nasty and tasted old, had not a good flavor. I might be coming back here but only to order queso and chicharrón! I do not recommend anything that has beans as there beans are not tasty. On a side note, I also thought this place smelled a bit weird, like a weird mint funky flavor?.."}
{"text":"This place is a true gem! Our family always come here to get their pupusas and their bistek with caramelized onions. Their food is so delicious; we keep coming back! The portions are huge so it's worth the buck. Also, the fresh fruit cocktail drink is the best; don't pass up on that!  The only downfall is that since it's a little family owned spot, the service can be a little on the slower side. Make sure you have plenty time to order and eat when you stop by this place. The one and only waiter there is so awesome and very sweet; you can tell he works very hard to keep up with everyone there! It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"For my first time ever eating Salvadorian food I gotta say it was pretty good. Tasted pretty authentic but I'd have to go to El Salvador to be  on that comment. Boyfriend had a problem with the beans being \"puréed\" and the Salsa was watery, but after researching I realized that's just how they make beans in El Salvador. Overall good experience and very tasty food! My favorite were the pupusas and the corn tamale!"}
{"text":"The first place I have found around me that sells pupusas.  I've gone twice with 2  friends who have never tried pupusas and they both loved it.  My only complaint is that the second time I had the jalapeno popular it was too hot for me to eat and my friend couldn't finish hers either.  Other than that the food is great and the server papa Willy is amazing.  Always so kind and attentive"}
{"text":"Delightful, delicious, delectable, traditional, inexpensive, great service, and a clear passion for what they do.  If Salvadoran food is your bag, do not miss this place."}
{"text":"We had the sampler for two which is enough for four. Beef, shrimp, chicken, chorizo, rice, beans and salad. Very flavorful and really enjoyed it. Rice was wonderful.  Very clean establishment."}
{"text":"Muy buen servicio al cliente y la comida muy buena"}
{"text":"Legit like always, best East valley salvadoreño restaurant. And hands down some of the best pupusas I have tried in the whole United States. The food is always fresh. The carne asada plate is bomb. The caldo de res tastes just like my moms."}
{"text":"Two Salvadoreño experiences for me in week. Lucky me. And I love walking in to a place where we are the only Anglos in the joint. Amazingly prepared pupusas, and perfectly fried plantains were all we needed--all were delicious. Tried one I had never seen before (Lorroco Flower & cheese), and it had a subtle, citrus-like finish, with the creamyness of the masa and cheese. Definitely worth trying if you visit. The big, friendly Señor taking care of the whole dining area was a great host.  I hope someday a pupusaria opens in my metro. Till then these guys hold the mantle in my mind..."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last night and it was SUPER authentic! The pupusas were delicious, the only clean water available was bottled, and I got food poisoning! Just like a trip to Central America, Montezuma's revenge included! Wow!"}
{"text":"Best popusa in town! Friendly atmosphere. I'm vegetarian and they were very accommodating. I had black bean popusa without cheese (comes with cheese) and corn tamales. The best!"}
{"text":"I have never tried authentic El Salvadorian food before. A friend took me here for lunch the other day. I tried pupusas with chicharron y queso. So amazing. I will definitely be back with my husband."}
{"text":"We'd never had popusas before but boy are we fans now! We ordered the family platter and got a couple of each kind - they were all great. We weren't familiar with the drinks either so our server gave us samples of all of them so we could find what we liked. Our family had a great meal for a good price."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Motel 6 within walking distance of this little shopping area and while in my room I Yelped eating places. I hadn't gotten my rental car yet so I was hoping there was some place in walking distance. When I was last here two years ago this location was sitting empty. Previously there had been a wonderful little restaurant called Z-lantro here that I just loved, run by a nice family. This place is also great. The people who run it are really nice, the atmosphere is fun and the food was excellent. I hope to get back here a couple more time this this trip even though I'm now staying in Chandler, not as convenient.   It might look like a fast food place from the outside but on the inside is a place that serves quality food with generous portions and delicious flavors, not to mention the uniqueness. I only know of one other Salvadoran restaurant in the area. So if you see that some of the prices are a little higher than you expected for a fast food restaurant be aware that you are getting quality restaurant food, not cheap fast food.    I didn't have a fridge in my motel room to get a large quantity of food and take back leftovers so I just ordered two items off the appetizer list to try out plus a cup of coffee. The coffee was extremely strong and came with powdered creamer but when I asked for milk they cheerfully brought me some. I got a queso pupusa and a green leaf tamale, both delicious!  I can't wait to go back and try something else next time."}
{"text":"Long wait time, but the food is very delicious. The waiter is always very nice!  I normally have the 3 popusas with rice and beans."}
{"text":"Just finished eating at Glady's - Holy Moly was it good. I saw that it had all 5 star reviews and that can be tough to believe but in this case - well deserved. Service was also top notch and prices were good.  Ordered the platter on the back of the menu - steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The favorite thing I ate by far. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place was alright just to try. The thing that stood out to me was service, very friendly. I wouldn't go back just because a few things were off to me. For starters the pupusas were just alright, a bit too mushy for my liking. Black beans were a bit too salty. NThe curtido was missing more flavor, it was a bit too bland to be called good. The red salsa was extremely watery, it literally tasted like water, which is crazy for me because although I don't like spice, I like flavor. Super crazy thing that when we asked for a glass of water we were told that they only had water bottles, of course at a price...I was under the impression Arizona state law mandates restaurants offer water but whatever, we passed on that since I had a room temperature water bottle in my purse anyway..I wouldn't recommend going if you're pressed on time, it takes a bit longer than most restaurants, which they did have a sign advising most plates take an average of 30 mins to come out...overall it made no lasting impression and I'll have to keep looking for authentic, delicious Central American food."}
{"text":"Best Salvadoran Food in Arizona. The Papusas are to die for!!! The resturuant is small but clean, and the staff is more then helpful."}
{"text":"This place was great only reason why not 5 stars was very small hard to get around waiter was very good to us and manager made his rounds to each table a few times to make sure everyone was happy and food was soooo delicious!!!!! And you get more food than you pay for big portions!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a fluke and was so happy we stopped.  We ordered one of the platters from the back page of the menu...it was a great way to sample all that good stuff.  We got 2 huge papusas of our choice, 2 tamales, beans, empanada, yuca, plantain, and pork belly with all the accompaniment.    Overall, the food and service was great, the waiter was very attentive without being overbearing and annoying.  They only lost a star due to being a little messy...nothing that a quick run through by staff can't clean, they may have just had a rush before we walked in, idk.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Looking for Pupusas? some really good Pupusas? Then this is the spot!   We visited this place on a Friday and it was empty when we arrived and full when we left. This place offers a great variety of traditional Salvadorian dishes. We ordered two agua frescas, Tamarind and Horchata. I must say that the Horchata is the real deal, you can taste the grinded rice for this drink. Very Authentic.   Pupusas were really flavorful. I would have like to try more than just two but they are large enough to fill you. They have a Mexican Pupusas which is Cheese and Jalapeno. I would have liked them to be a little crispy but I am sure I can ask for it next time."}
{"text":"You can get more tasty food for less money here than just about anywhere else.  Also, Willy is about the friendliest dude you are ever going to meet, great service."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for lunch and tried the the corn tamales and papusas with the freshest cabbage on top. I can see why they get so many rave reviews. Our server was very polite and explained all the dishes on the menu. My husband had the sample plate and gave it 4 stars. Drinks come only in bottles and no iced tea.  We will return!"}
{"text":"If you didn't know, now you know. Everything was delicious and the service was great. Tried 5 different pupusas and they were excellent. My fav was the mexican pupusa with jalapeños.  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Very good food, friendly staff. Today was my first time eating here and I'll come back for more  I can't wait!"}
{"text":"This is what I call good food. If you looking for good salvadorean food this is the place to come and eat."}
{"text":"Me and my Bf come here every time we crave pupusas , they are the best! Not only that the waiter is always checking up on us to see if need anything or if everything is perfectly fine! (:"}
{"text":"The service was great the waiter and boh staff very professional,this was our 2 nd visit tried the caldo de para it's like tripe soup,the best one so far."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We got the papusas special, they were so good. Came with yummy black beans and rice. We also got the chicken sandwich and empanada. Also very good. Great service"}
{"text":"Never had pupusas before and was referred to this place by numerous people. This was for a good reason, the food here is exceptional!!! The atmosphere was amazing and the service was even better!! I thoroughly enjoyed myself and will definitely be a regular for their perfect pupusas!!"}
{"text":"Good food and the price is right. Pupusas are cooked well, but I have had better. The texture was just a bit off to what I normally experience but they are still worth every penny. Tamal de pollo had seeded green olives in it which is something new to me. Empanadas were small but three come in an order. Service was prompt and you definitely feel like you are in El Salvador when inside this place."}
{"text":"Good food and great service! Authentic Salvadoranian food. They actually have Pan con Pavo!! The Pupusas are softer, because they are made fresh! Not sitting out and warmed up to serve. Oh and they have a green sauce that is spicier than the regular red sauce you put on Pupusas  and it is excellent."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Salvadoran food. We tried almost everything--all the pupusas, yucca, empanadas, tamales, fajitas, black refried beans, rice, and jícama and mixed fruit (like licuados) drinks. Terrific flavors! Everything was fresh. The presentation was excellent! Be careful; it's so easy to order too much. But then you can always take the extra home. The service was very good, too. Economical! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very authentic little hole in the wall with many things to try! The papusas were amazing and we wish we had just gotten a big order of those! We tried the plantain and a breakfast platter and everything was great ! Atmosphere was welcoming and the waiter took great care of us!"}
{"text":"My brother and I found this place by mistake. I'm glad we did though! If you love authentic Salvadorian food then this is the place for you. The pupusas were tasty and the service was great. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great service although sometimes slow.  Food is delicious specially the rice.  Small place but nice and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service was great, great attitude of staff.   Food was hot but not good.  Had the bean & cheese pupusas. Beans were black and tasted old.  Stomach has been hurting all day. X_X"}
