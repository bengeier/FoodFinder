{"text":"Ordered online on one of the mobile food delivery apps. The food was hot but was very poor quality. I ordered the chicken fajitas, only came with 3 tortillas, had more onions than chicken and food went bad very quickly (only about 2 days before a real strange smell came out of the refrigerator. The one positive was that the chips and salsa was very good and seemed housemade. I Checked the sanitation score and this restaurant is actually on the list of the ten worst health inspection scores in July 2017, with a rating of a B. With the variety of mexican restaurants in charlotte, many of which at cheaper prices,I  cannot recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I don't normally go in on a place and give negative reviews, but today is the day!I would have loved to have given a review on the food this place, if I ever received it! I promise I stood at the front waiting to be seated and at least spoken to by the hostess for seven minutes without a single word or acknowledgement. The only reason why I stood there so long was because I was watching a livestream on my phone. She helped another woman, which was fine, but I never received even a single acknowledgment of my presence. Thankfully there are several other excellent Mexican restaurants in this ZIP code where I live. This place will never get my business."}
{"text":"If i can give this place a zero stars i would. The food is disgusting. They say it's mexican food but more of a latin flavor. They are CRAZY expensive in their seafood that if they were actually good i would not mind paying but it's subpar. Not only that when i go to pay and see my bill it is more than what was on the menu!! When i pointed it out they said thats what the computer stated even though the menu had other prices!! Horrible service."}
{"text":"We visited as a part of the Taste of the World tour in October. They rolled out the red carpet for our group, brining out plates and plates of food and explaining that they specialize in seafood. Everyone was very friendly. Unfortunately, the food was just average. (I compare all Mexican to Three Amigos, which is part of their problem. That bar is high!) The chips and salsa were pretty disappointing. We started with shrimp empanadas. The cheese/shrimp combo was a little odd. After that, we had shrimp ceviche. The shrimp were over cooked by all the citrus in the dish. I hate to say it, but if going out for Mexican, we would probably skip this spot."}
