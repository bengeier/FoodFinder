{"text":"I'm originally from Moon Twp. and moved away in 1989, but never forgot about Sauce Pot pizza. A few days ago I was back in the area and was eager to give it a try. It was positively awesome. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance deceive you, the hoagies here are great, fish sandwich platter (only on certain days) is great, even the chicken Caesar salad is good, I heard that the lasagna is good too. I have not had a bad meal from here plus the owners are nice and friendly. 

*This is a cash only place."}

{"text":"One of the best takeout joints you could ask for! Great steak hoagies! Great unique pizza! Great meatball hoagies!"}
{"text":"Great little family-owned biz with AWESOME FOOD!  The pasta, pizza, subs (meatball is out of this world!) and soup are all really, really good!
Been going there for years, and anytime I'm around the area, I always make a pit-stop!  You'll ALWAYS get a smile and a warm welcome, too!!"}
{"text":"We've been going there for pizza for years. They have what I can only describe as a 'bread pizza'. Your sauce and toppings are atop a delicious pillow of Mancini's bread, a Pittsburgh favorite. They also serve their hoagies on Mancini's rolls. The pizza can come baked or unbaked, which is nice because we live in the city, so we can pick up unbaked, and have fresh Sauce Pot pizza at home. 
A personal favorite of mine is their breaded cauliflower. Just the usual fried cauliflower, but if you ask them, they can make it spicy with some seasonings that makes it perfect.
Make sure you hit the ATM beforehand, this place is CASH ONLY!"}
