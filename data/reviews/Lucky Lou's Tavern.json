{"text":"Friendly place, staff is great, the twins are amazing at their job, good food, no really, good job you guys in the kitchen.  LIVE MUSIC! yea.... did I mention the twins are amazing?"}
{"text":"First time here, loved the Pimento Cheese Fritters, burgers were great.  Great service and just a fun place!"}
{"text":"Great dive bar.  Popped in on a visit from Atlanta, wanted a low key spot, this was it.  Great burger (fresh), friendly service and a good beer selection.  Reasonable prices too.  I'll be back when I visit next."}
{"text":"This has been our \"go to\" place for Panthers football.  App specials, etc....However, apparently they are not Panther fans any longer.  Six of us went there yesterday for the season opener and they decided it was more important to show the Seattle game on the big screen.  What changed?  Is this now a Seahawks place?"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this local place. I live right down the road, and I love local dives like this. We were the only people in there to watch Monday Night Football, the place was completely empty. We ordered pimento fritters for an appetizer and a black bean burger and a blackened cod sandwich for our entrees. Service was fine, as we were the only people in there and they had a total of 4 people working. The pimento fritters were cold in the center and came with a strange sweet sauce. Our burger came out without any cheese, so they took it back for about 5 minutes and came back with a tiny circle of semi-melted cheese on top. While the black bean burger had a good flavor, it was terribly greasy. The fish was pretty terrible. The strong smell and rubber texture left us eating the sandwich without the fish. The french fries had a weird, bitter taste to them - like the oil they fried it in was bad or something. One of my fries was completely hard and you couldn't bite into it, unsure what that was about. I looked at the bill and they charged us extra for a side salad and then a dollar more for dressing on the side, plus another dollar for some sauce for the black bean burger. We paid and walked around the shopping center. On our way back to get our cars, we smelled pot smoke throughout Lucky's parking lot. I looked over and an employee was smoking pot in the car with the door open. Yikes, maybe we were just not lucky."}
{"text":"Great service, lots of T.V.'s, varied menu. Definitely one to put on our regular list."}
{"text":"Love this place and the relaxed atmosphere! Great food and good music. Great staff! My go to late night bite."}
{"text":"Great food! I've had most of the food on the menu and all of it is pretty damn good. The staff rocks, and the drinks are perfect. This is my after work happy hour place. Love it!"}
{"text":"Lucky Lou's recently opened in the Park Selwyn Terrace shopping center (near Portofino's, Harris Teeter, etc.) where Fairview Grill used to be.  I'd gone to Fairview Grill all of once, so when something new opened up I figured it might be worth a try (and the 50% off coupon didn't hurt).  No trouble getting a table on a Monday night, it's your basic bar setting with a big projector screen showing some NCAA basketball and a bunch of smaller tv's showing other games and even How I Met Your Mother (seriously, who watches a sitcom at a bar?  I had to divert my attention so I didn't see what happened, spoiler alert!).  The food is pretty good and I highly recommend the \"Dippin' Chicken\" - a fried or grilled chicken sandwich dipped in whatever wing sauce you want.  I went for the Barbalo and was definitely happy with it, although it didn't have too much spice to it.  The sandwich was huge, probably 4 or 5 chicken tenders squeezed onto a bun with some lettuce and bacon (also comes with tomato and onion, but who eats that junk).  For the side, definitely get the buffalo chips.  They're thicker than normal chips, more like potato slices from heaven, with some buffalo seasoning thrown on and fried.    Fiance got the black & bleu burger with sweet potato fries and didn't have anything negative to say about it.  Honey chicken pasta seemed to be a crowd pleaser as well.  Decent beer selection makes this a good place to go to when you don't feel like fighting for a table at Selwyn."}
{"text":"Fun place to watch a Seahawks football game. Great food and cold beer. There are a lot of TV's so you can see the game from anywhere in the place."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by Lucky Lou's! I've only been there once before when it was Fairview Grill so wasn't sure what Lou's was going to be all about. It's so frickin dark in this place you feel like you're walking into the unknown and it was absolutely empty on a beautiful sunshine filled day day so I was stoked to see they had a patio area. Along with that they have a good number of tables out there plus a ping pong table...or beef pong table....or flip cup table depending on how rowdy it gets there.   Typical bar food you would find anywhere but I surprised myself by ordering the Black & Bleu steak salad and it was just what I needed on a hot day. They give you a generous portion of steak, pair that up with candied pecans and bleu cheese crumbles and you have a solid steak salad. My friend got the fish and chips and when they brought it out, we couldn't stop staring at the piece of fish they served. As opposed to a few pieces of fish it was one huge piece of fish and I think the biggest I've ever seen. Like fish on steroids big (see pics) All in all, a solid place to stop by for some food and drinks. I will be back for those delightful sounding Pimento Cheese Fritters they have!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch football and hang with others.  Good vibes all around. Plenty of space to move around, even with 50 crazed Seahawks fans in the house.   The chicken soft tacos had a smooth queso and were very nicely done. Another at the table had the chicken nachos.  Also very good.  Will be back on game day !"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a cold beer and bite to eat.   Must try the pimento cheese fritter appetizer.    Staff very outgoing."}
{"text":"Not sure how many places this particular location has been but it still has the interior that is pretty much the same as when it was Fairview Grill way back in the day. I'm not sure what it is that bugs me about this place but the atmosphere seems to be kinda....idk.... not fun? There food, from the chicken wings, fries, quesadillas and sandwiches are pretty much your standard bar food fare.  It is all decent and the service is what I would call good but the inside itself is just kinda downright depressing. They do have a nice projection TV for watching the football game on as well as a bunch of other TV's but if you are trying to hit this place for anything other than football you will for sure have to endure a bunch of screaming fans. I'd chalk this one up for maybe a decent local bar if I was in the area but other than that it's not really worth stopping by."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Buffalo Chips.  Otherwise wasn't a huge fan of the food, but in all fairness what I ordered was something our server said was not that good."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, and I got maybe 5 onion rings with my burger. Husband got his food and seemed pleased with it. Fresh fried potato chips were sort of good, until the to-go order I asked for. Too floppy then.   Wait staff was non-existent. One bartender, for a place that was going to host karaoke. I don't know how busy she really was, but seemed to take twice as long as it should. Then when backup finally appeared, she disappears and husband had to go to the bar for our check."}
{"text":"Two friends of mine are pretty big regulars at Lou's, so I have been a few times to meet them out for a few drinks there. After a few visits, one thing that stands out is that the place is pretty consistent. Some people call it a dive bar, but I do not see it that way. The food definitely consists of bar type items but are actually pretty good. Good wings, burgers, and sandwiches. I like the fried pimento cheese balls that they have on their appetizer menu. And as far as what people go there for....the drinks, are good also. Cheap and stiff with daily specials on top of that. The beer menu is not vast but they usually have at least one good beer on tap."}
{"text":"This is a local place to hang out for sure! The people are always friendly and they actually do have quite an amazing karaoke night! Fun listening and songs that are sing worthy - crowds join in and it simply adds to the fun. Pool tables also help add to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We love lucky's. The staff is always friendly and knows us by name. They have a large menu. I love the club sandwich and the blackened chicken alfredo pasta. Better than your average bar food. They have a patio with 5 or 6 large tables. For those who vape- as long as you're not blowing it directly in someone's face, they'll let you vape inside. They have pool tables and karaoke several times a week. Drink specials every day and great service. Drinks are reasonably priced. Good draft beer selection with several local craft beers. If you're looking for a low key bar in the area, definitely check it out"}
{"text":"DAMN YOU LUCY!   I feel like Charley Brown and Lucky Lou holds the football.  In my first review I said the fish and chips were the best I ever had, so in spite of the lousy prime rib as covered in my most recent review, I went back for that great fish and chips.  It was the worst I have ever had.  The fish, tilapia, had a musty flavor.  But the good news is the taste of old basement was overcome by being fried in very old oil, dark from oxidation which makes the batter bitter.  Ugh!  Oxidized oil is not an accident.  You can see it in the fryer.  Food comes out of it very dark and--again--BITTER!    Unlike Charlie Brown who trusted Lucy time after time, I don't trust Lucky Lou's anymore.  They should change the name to Lucy Lou's."}
{"text":"Friday night in Charlotte. We always call friends in Columbus Ohio and do a \"long-distance toast\" Lucky Lou's was close by. So we went there. What we found was amazing. A great neighborhood bar with a lively crowd of mixed age from their 20's to their 60,s. Great service from their staff. Also a big plus for us. KARAOKE! Chubby's Karaoke has a great selection and our host was very helpful for us to adapt to his system. The crowd mad us feel welcome. We had a great time"}
{"text":"Well, now that I've been coming here for over 2 years I am very much a regular so this review is maybe biased.  The bartenders will get to know your name and what you drink and have it ready for you.  I recommend the blackened chicken pasta and everyone I told to eat it has enjoyed it.  Their wings are pretty popular and the pizzas are good too.  The bar tenders pour them strong, but will not hesitate to kick you out if you get rowdy."}
{"text":"I attended Lucky Lou's for an afterwork function with a couple of my friends and we ordered drinks and some food. They have $1 off drafts and decent drink specials. The food was prepared in a timely manner and the servers were very friendly. I ordered the club sandwich combo based on a previous Yelper and it was \"ok\". My friends ordered pasta and they both had to send it back due to the bland taste.   TLW's summary: decent drink specials, ok, and good service."}
{"text":"Definitely tavern-esce. However, if you need more light they have a side patio. There's also a ping pong table off of the patio or pool tables indoors. They allow smoking on the patio.   $2 PBR all the time.   Good chicken wings and club sandwich.   They have live music on Friday nights."}
{"text":"This is a central meeting place for a bunch of us.  It's definitely a tavern - a bar with decent food, pool tables, an outdoor area, and karaoke a few nights a week.  The bartenders are always friendly and they have some good specials and some local beers on tap.  It's a decent place to hang out on a Saturday night and try to sing.  It looks divey, but the sanitation grades are always high."}
{"text":"Charlotte native here so, I know the city. I don't cook so, I have little time for places that are not consistently good. The food here is always good. There are always interesting characters hanging around. Kind of lends to the charm. Huge bar, plenty of seating. Got to go check out the smoking hot bartender, Andi!"}
{"text":"Hot Chips made-to-order!  \"Light and Limp please\"!  These chips were PERFECT!!!  5 yelp stars for the Chips!!!  This IS a Sports Bar and since I'm in here I'll enjoy the Sports on many screens... I'm not a fan of sports Bars, (nor Sports) though if the food is great, I'll put up with the Sports... Hey Buddy how you doing Champion...  That's me Buddy Champion (no one called me that here Thankfully)!  The Music (play list) sounded like what I would put on my Music Machine, if I had a Music Machine...or the Dance program at least (sounded like some \"Killers\" I'm barely Familiar with - that sound anyway)... They have some LIVE Music too, though not at Lunch time!  Service was GREAT, Friendly, relaxed and everything was served as ordered!  Bad News Burger!  A \"Drier\" Burger is fine, this one was too dry... BIG (1/2 Pound) lacked flavor, the Bacon was over cooked (Maybe Microwaved???) too dry as well, very little flavor!  The Bun for the Burger was a nice one and did not get soggy because the Burger was sooo dry... The Burger gets 2 yelp stars or less"}
{"text":"Just be YOU at Lucky Lou's!  Friendliest staff in the area. This place is the epitome of a friendly neighborhood bar. Great food goes hand and hand with the atmosphere. Plenty to do after you grab some delicious grub. There are pool tables, darts, karaoke, an awesome patio, cornhole and screens to catch your favorite teams! LIVE music is a bonus on those Friday nights when you're  looking to forget about the hussle and bussle of of a busy work week."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was blown away. The food and drinks were amazing. My friends and I really enjoyed ourselves here. Very laid back atmosphere. Andi our host was great. If you aren't quite ready for the Carolina Reaper wings, order the sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Small bar/restaurant on park road.  I believe It was formally \"Fairview Grille.\"  Lots of parking available and good beer prices.  It's a good place to watch Panthers games.  Be aware that it is a Seahawks bar.  I enjoy coming here to watch Panthers games because it's close to my house and not too crowded.  The food I've had has been good but nothing special.  I do recommend the Buffalo chips.  For five dollars you get a large basket of fresh cooked chips and a side of ranch dressing. Good for snacking during the game.  The pimento cheese fritters are tasty.  They are best when cut in half and served with the tomato jelly poured on top.  Nothing fantastic about the spinach dip.  The Carolina reaper wings are very spicy but have a good flavor.  I'm not a fan of the way they prepare the wings.  They fry them and then cook them on the grille so you get a charred taste and look.  The wait staff and bartenders are very friendly.  Overall, it's not a bad place to go but it isn't anything special either."}
{"text":"My friend lives for Chubby's karaoke at Lucky's. That is the only reason I would go here. Otherwise, there is nothing remarkable about the bar. Also, after one drink I was HAMMERED- a friend had to drive me home. Pretty sure something was put in my drink by one of the patrons... Scary"}
{"text":"Shocked this dump has more than 3 Stars! Don't even fry food well. Burgers are very poor quality. Place isn't clean in the slightest. Bathrooms are dirty. Drinks are cheap!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for some drinks after a wonderful dinner so this is a drinks only rating.  The place is kind of divey which is fine.  I like a good dive. The bartenders both a litle odd. My drink ws okay but its hard to screw up a captain and diet.  My friends drinks were awful.  They kept trying to add stuff to it to make it better.   Probably would skip this place next time."}
{"text":"The ribeye sandwich was pretty tasty and the Buffalo Chips were awesome. The fries are okay. The service was friendly and helpful. I would return again for sure."}
{"text":"One of my fave neighborhood joints in the Queen City. Solid array of bar grub here, including standards such as burgers, wings, and sandwiches. I'm partial to the Club Sandwich, one of the best I've eaten out at a restaurant. Probably because they butter and toast the bread on the flat top! Oh yeah!  Say Hi to Sal, one of friendliest bartenders around and an icon of South Park."}
{"text":"So we finally found a karaoke place in Charlotte! Its s really nice stand alone building and has ample parking, a very well lit parking lot which is nice. We got there about 945 so it was 15 minutes before Chubby's karaoke kicked off everything, so we were able to get a booth and sat down for some drinks and appetizers. We wanted to check out the vibe first so we set back and watch a couple different people go up and do karaoke. It was really cool because the crowd was mixed and there was a wide range if mysical variety. It was nice my first time going out to do karaoke(I normally do it in the basement after a couple shots of tequila) so we sat back and enjoyed the show I'm sure we'll be regulars from this point on. It cost them a star because of the lack of local beers on tap."}
{"text":"Great service and best bar food I have had in a long time! Will definitely be a regular stop when I am in Charlotte! Try the spinach dip!! Amazing!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a local bar, with karaoke, lots of tvs, drinks specials, and a patio this is your place!    My first visit to Lucky Lous was for burger week ($5 burgers at multiple restaurants) and it did not disappoint!  The service was on point and the burger was delicious.  They had me at pimento cheese AND bacon.  We ordered a side of fries and homemade chips.  The burger was cooked perfectly and the homemade chips were delicious!  I wish we would have gotten a basket of those delicious things.  Lucky Lou's also had a drink special of $3.25 Budweiser bottles, which made my husband happy!    We will be back."}
{"text":"Our service was attentive... I will only patronize this establishment when Sherry is on the clock.. I cant speak about Tuesdays and Thursdays however since Sherry isnt available on those days, I won't be stopping in...the decor was just we expected... hipster tavern feel... food was mildly seasoned and my bloody mary was on point. My pockets didn't die as the meals are reasonably priced. You can easily access this location. Everything was great and I will be back soon!  Bte.. try the fried green tomato melt with the tomato jelly..."}
{"text":"This place was a dive with terrible drinks, and the bartender's argued over who was serving us.  It didnt' really matter since they both made the worst drinks I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"I was asked to bring chicken wings to an event. The first place I thought of was Lucky Lou's. It had been awhile but I remembered how good their wings were the last time I had them. Lisa answered the phone and I asked how long it would take to cook up 50 wings. She told me 20 minutes which is about how long it takes me to drive there. As I walked in my order was ready to go. Lisa told me she had just put them in the bags. I can tell you that several people told me how good they were and asked where I got them. Thanks for the great service, Lisa, and thanks to Willie in the kitchen for some great wings."}
{"text":"Where do I start? What I love most about this bar is that the staff is friendly and personable.  They recognize you when you walk in and they know what you drink.  Now, that's also indicative that I've spent too much time there but really folks, it's a laid back neighborhood bar.  Great place to watch football or March Madness.  Head's up during Football Season this is a Seahawk's Bar but it is possible to watch the Panthers on plenty of tvs.    Ambience is pretty low key and mellow, most clientele is in their late 20s to 60ish... They have drink specials and an okay sized food menu.  $5 Dollar Mimosas on Sundays! My current favorite is the chips and queso - Not spicy at all (I don't do spicy)! Their Chicken tenders are on point tho! They're crispy on the outside but tender in the inside - soooo just right!  I'm usually a ranch fan but their honey mustard dressing is delish! Tenders come with fries or kettle chips.  Fried pickle chips are pretty good, too!  There's an outdoor patio.  Plenty of seatIng available - you  can choose to sit in their booths, high top pub tables or sit at the bar.   Two pool tables toward the back of the bar.  Well-lit parking lot.   Be sure to order the Cinnamon Toast Crunch shot!"}
{"text":"It's under new management...they've stepped up their game as far as food goes...great local neighborhood bar..."}
{"text":"My new favorite dive bar/local bar! I can't really speak  on the food, altho I've had their fried pickle chips and they were amazing! Drinks are plentiful, reasonably priced, and sometimes strong! Beware of Andi's Jack and cokes! ;P The bartenders are friendly and funny (we love us some Andi and Sherri). My favorite night to go is Friday when they have karaoke; great for people watching! And they also have a great patio for just relaxing with friends. Can't wait to try it out for a Panthers game!"}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner while visiting Charlotte.  Service was excellent and the food was very good.   Andi, our server, was friendly and attentive to our needs.  She made us laugh and made eating at Lucky Lou's an enjoyable experience.  I definitely recommend giving Lucky Lou's a try."}
{"text":"As someone who drives a distance to actually GO to Lucky Lou's, I purpose to head there. I've always had a great experience. Andi,  the manager has always gone out of her way to make herself present and seen. The food is so good. I have yet to have anything there I didn't like and the staff is always working hard. I love this local bar. Wish I was closer. The fact that some Seahawk fans get together for games, make it better... Highly recommend"}
{"text":"In town for a meeting and wanted wings and baseball! Came In here and was not disappointed. Mark, our waiter was awesome. My kids had chicken fingers the other had a burger. I had the teriyaki wings and they were out of this world good. They were playing music bingo and my kids and I had a blast. We will be back next time we are in town!! Good food, good people and an even better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great bar. Loved that the crowd was mainly 30's-60's folks. Karaoke was great and not crowded on Wednesday. I could actually hear myself singing and wasn't blasted by music. Karaoke DJ was nice & bartenders are friendly. Can't wait to go back!! Might be a fun spot to watch ACC tournament too."}
{"text":"Best club sandwich is charlotte... I swear they put drugs in it because once you try it you will definately have to eat it again. I order mine with the buffalo chips which are super tasty. The wings are hit or miss, sometimes better than others, usually not cooked enough. Ordered nachos once and it was more chips than toppings and I wouldnt order again. They have good drink specials, pool and a huge patio. Depending on the day there are bands, karaoke or just music playing. Its a good time especially on the weekends."}
