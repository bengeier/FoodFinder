{"text":"Very authentic and high quality. A must eat if your in the area and looking for great Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place had been around for a really long time, I was kind of disappointed when they brought the food out to the table, it didn't look that good and the taste just wasn't there, all in all I wasn't that happy with everything (service, food, price). With so many places in newmarket to choose from, I won't be going back there again"}
{"text":"Good food, great servive but Expensive,"}
{"text":"As a white, Canadian-born who has never travelled to an Asian country (I include these details because people constantly tell me this food isn't comparable to \"real\" Asian food) this is by far the best Chinese food I've ever had. The quality of sauces and overall ingredients exceeds every other chain, restaurant, fast-food joint I've tried. 

We usually pick-up food to go, but at least once a year we will dine-in.  The decoration and ambiance of the restaurant are unique and visually pleasing. They have traditional music and wear traditional outfits. This really adds to the dining experience.

Every time I eat in, I feel like I am their number one priority. They immediately look after us, take our drink order, followed by food order, all within 10-15 minutes of being seated. You never feel rushed, they are really awesome at taking note of whether your menu is still open and you're browsing or closed and ready. Once everything is ready, they place everything on your table and scoop portions on your plate. They respect your space if that's not your thing however. 

The food isn't heavy like the Chinese food I've had in other restaurants. The sauces are flavourful and light, the deep fried stuff isn't too battery or oily, and the noodles and rice are always cooked perfectly. A bonus, when we order deep fried dished to go, they always serve the sauce on the side so it's still crispy when it gets home. 

I would recommend this place to ANYONE!"}
{"text":"I'm better now, thanks.

*****
First time I'd ever been to Cynthia's.

Went with a large group.
No Birthday hoopla as promised, even though when I made the reservation,
 I was asked if there was a special occasion.

Disappointing.

Even though I made the arrangements and paid the bill, 
no staff acknowledged my presence. 

Was told by one of our group that there's a discount if you pay cash.  
Don't know if that's true, but I saw no mention of it anywhere.
Might have brought cash if it is true and if I'd known.

Could have gotten over all of that, except ...

Ordered one \"gluten free\" dish - it was just for me and that's all that I ate - separate utensils, the whole bit - and was sick the next day for hours and hours.

Not nice.
*****
Yeah, not going back."}
{"text":"I have gone to this restaurant over the years and have been away for a while. I returned and was very disappointed. The atmosphere remains elegant. Ut the lunch dish I ordered was shameful. I ordered the vegetable mix special. Hot and sour soup was fine (there is pork in it) which is why I gave it two stars. I specifically asked if they could replace certain vegetables on the dish (I dont like carrots or onions) with more broccoli, bok choy, and mushrooms (already part of the dish). They said they could. I was VERY CLEAR about this and my friend was with me and witnessed my \"Sally\" moment. What arrived was one mushroom in 3 slices, 3 small pieces of broccoli and tons of STEMS of the bok choy--not a single green leaf. You dont wven feed pet bunnies this crap. Oh, and rice. This dish was $10.95. I was so disgusted at how cheap they were. When I complained they first tried to blame me for not being clear to which my girlfriend retorted \"oh, she was real clear...\" the  , they offered to give me am ice cream for free (I dont eat dessert) when I asked them to give me another smaller dish with the vegetables they must have forgotten to place on my dish. I suggested they try again or remove the charge (I hadn't eaten the rice or the heaping plate of stems (otherwise know as the garbage). They refused. NEVER GOING BACK AND TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS AMD FAMILY. My mother then told me that this used to be her favourite place until they did the same thing to her amd she has never returned. Don't go. If you want stems, T and T will give them to you--no one wants to eat the garbage."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place/gave it a chance recently, and it's amazing. The amount of time, effort, and care that is put into every element of the decor/food/service is unbelievable. I was skeptical because of of most strip-mall foods I've encountered, and the name is kind of strange.

Great selection of drinks, dishes. I can't say enough good things about it. Anyone who would say that the prices are unreasonable is a complete idiot, in my opinion. Some of the booze is overpriced, but everything else that you get at this place as a complete package is crazy awesome value! I've had trouble finding good spots in Oakville, but this certainly qualifies. Killer spot to take a first date...."}
{"text":"I've had better Chinese food (nearby Omei comes to mind) but not better service or presentation. The experience is excellent. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Overpriced!  $3.50 for a small egg roll - this will give you a sense of how expensive everything is. I have been eating here for a few years now and I think they increased their price and the quality has come down. Poor value. Last time I eat here. Very disappointing. I feel like I have been ripped off."}
{"text":"Cynthia's is just down the street from us and we have ordered there a few times.
My in laws order there more often, they like celebrating birthdays with Peking duck.

Unfortunately tonight was the last night we will give them our business.
My spouse and I are vegetarian and order the same things every time

Tonight we ordered fried rice, spicy eggplant, and OK tofu. When she confirmed the order I have to admit I couldn't fully understand her over her accent but it sounded close enough.


My husband ran in to grab it and we hurried home excited and hungry.

Oh no they gave us squid not eggplant and we are vegetarian so we can't just make do. Not a big deal we will call have them make an eggplant and pick it up in 10 take back the untouched squid.

To my disappointment we were met with staff who said in the few seconds since we called they already reviewed the conversation and you said squid. 

First of all I'm vegetarian I can assure you I don't accidentally order meat and fish.

Secondly who cares if I did? We are regular customers and it's a $7 eggplant, surely she couldn't be serious?

Then she tells him he should be more careful next time? 

I obviously assumed a manager would never lose our business over a $7 eggplant and ask for him.

Ben comes on, pretty much laughs while talking over me the whole time, tells me she is best employee is broken English and is ok to lose our business. 

So I advised me I regret is choice, will not be back and will ensure my friends neighbours and family don't either as well as mention him specifically in my reviews. He stated this is ok happily as well.

Too bad, the food was pretty good if he just said sorry and let me get the eggplant I would still spend my money there."}
{"text":"The appetizers and soups were great! Definitely try their seafood. Escargot was superb and I'm sure scallops too.

I agree with the rest of the people that the service was very formal and feels uneasy at times.

The Peking duck was definitely a huge disappointment. I don't think it's fresh prepared. It may be cooked before and heated up when ordered. They also don't patiently cut it, sort of chop it up and put them on the plate."}
{"text":"Service and style remind me of Toronto's number 1 Chinatown (Dundas and Bay) in the 70s, but maybe fancier.  Service is overdone and excellent.

Food on the other hand -- dim sum starters are not on menu at lunchtime?? Odd.  15 minutes to produce har gow which had rubbery shrimp inside and watery noodle wrapper and less than fresh sesame oil (if indeed any - the taste was reminiscent of sesame oil going off).

Also off menu at lunch -- Mu shu pork - this was an odd odd odd version -- too much sauce and very tomatoe-y (really?) which didn't allow the taste of the hoisin to come through except to multiply sweetness.  The pork was nice, but all sorts of other traditional ingredients seemed to be missing.

Overall, I get the impression of chinese food meant to impress people who don't know much about chinese food. Maybe they were having a bad day."}
{"text":"It's like going back in centuries to the old times. Very much like going on a tintin adventure to ancient China. Food tastes so so. It's not very authentic, and is incredibly bland. The food is mostly what you would associate with stereotypical Chinese dishes - not actual Chinese cuisine. The people serve food like robots with stiff and fake smiles. I can taste the dust of their old kitchen in the dishes... very strange. Outside the window, it's an urban and modern world, but inside this restaurant it stays in the 1800s. I feel pity for all the people praising their food. Please visit China to have a taste of real Szechuan chicken - because I guarantee this is not what it tastes like."}
{"text":"Simply the best Chinese food I have ever had (I've been 25+ times over the course of 10 years). This includes small town family run joints, Spadina after the bar too many times to count etc."}
{"text":"Ordered a take out with Indonesian noodles, king prawns in black bean sauce, General Tao chicken and vegetable spring rolls. Not sure if i ordered the wrong dishes, but was not impressed at all with the food (very surprised by the good ratings here). Everything tasted sweet (with an excess of tomato sauce), was very oily, and the king prawns in black bean sauce was pretty salty as well. Very disappointed since someone recommended this place as well over Mandarin, but I definitely found the food in Mandarin better the last time I visited there !"}
{"text":"Lemon Chicken, fresh Veggies with almonds, fried rice and Sizzling Mongolian Beef. Feast for a king. Food is fabulous, service is top drawer.
You won't find a better Chinese food restaurant this side of Shanghai ! Be adventurous, have a TsingTao beer with your meal."}
{"text":"Love this place- it is actually my favourite restaurant. I highly recommend ordering Chicken fired Noodles (with no vegetables) it will blow your mind, as will the (mushy) vegetarian spring rolls."}
{"text":"Cynthia's is a solid 4. Their decor is a little over the top but the food is great. The staff is friendly and prices are reasonable. Some of the menu items feel really authentic Chinese and not so Americanized."}
{"text":"Excellent food, terrific service, and very comfortable environment. The hot and sour soup was the best I've had anywhere in the WORLD! I felt like I had been transported to Shanghai. Many thanks to the staff. Great people!"}
{"text":"Food sucked, chicken tasted like it was made in the microwave. Ordered vegetable chow mein, got bean sprouts."}
{"text":"Over priced suburban Chinese Food is one thing but the grumpy faced (my son's description) unresponsive waitress is another. 

If you like over priced Chinese Food, slow service (an hour and a half) & grumpy faced staff who dismisses your complaints with zero response & death stares this is the perfect place. Enjoy & plan accordingly. Make sure you leave the kids at home because they'll lose their appetite after asking why she (the waitress) is so \"mean faced\" & request to go home because \"service is better\" at home.

PS Suggestion: Do take out at Red Chille instead! Always consistent & staff is responsive with zero \"mean face\"!"}
{"text":"Eating in at Cynthia's is expensive.  Having said that, we always do take-out and find the prices competitive with other Chinese food restaurants for take-out.  The food comes in lovely hard plastic containers instead of the cardboard ones.  The portions are quite large.  The prawns are enormous, chicken dishes are filled with white meat and all of the vegetables are crunchy and fresh, not overly cooked and mushy.  We don't usually order battered dishes or dishes in sauces, so we can't comment on those, but I think I've heard that the sauces come separate from the food so things don't get mushy. 

If you spend over $40 you can ask for a bonus of either vegetable chow mein or house fried rice.  And, if you pay by cash you can get a discount.  Our only complaint would be that they do not have a house plum sauce -- they give you the little packets.  We would definitely recommend Cynthia's take-out in Thornhill -- it's always delicious."}
{"text":"Food is fine. Price is over. I am Chinese and we just move here. I think more and more Chinese restaurant open here, they gonna lose customers."}
{"text":"Amazing food, love this place ! 

It's so classy, beautiful decor, and the food is phenomenal, so delicious. I love this place, I highly recommend."}

{"text":"Overpriced and real Chinese cuisine much better at hwy 7 10 minutes away"}
{"text":"Take out service is horrible. Put us on hold twice and even when we wanted to change our order we had to wait on hold for over 15 minutes."}
{"text":"This food is not the same as all you can eat Cynthia's paradise.

Chicken fried rice was awful no egg no chicken just bland oily rice

Really bad americanized Chinese food

Go to Cynthia's Paradise all you can eat instead 
100 times better!

{"text":"The food is mediocre at best and is overpriced. Be careful for hidden fees added to your bill."}
{"text":"The place is beautifully decorated, a very different experience from most Chinese places I've been to. Live music as well. The only thing I was not a fan of , too many servers but food was good."}
{"text":"Terrible. Reached out to them because I had an issue on Facebook. They said they would and never got back to me. The food took 15 min to my door step. I live 10 min away ???! Ummmmm sounds fishy to me. The noodles were doughy and no flavor at all. Chicken balls were dry and re fried."}
{"text":"Great food

We
Had the spring roles, corn soup, chicken vegetables and sweet and sour chicken
We all enjoyed the dinner
was a little surprised to see tea we had to start on the bill. Normally it is included."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Service is Asian service.. Which I'm used to be to.. I can't say it's bad. They actually serve two menus, one is more simple one with gourmet ingredients they serve to the general public. and the other is in Chinese, more expensive and has more authentic ingredients and takes more skill to make. I get why... Cause authenticity doesn't always lead to popularity, especially in a town like Oakville. Food is decent but price is similar to high end Chinese restaurants in Markham and Richmond hill. Only go here if I don't wanna make the drive out to York region."}
{"text":"I've been eating Chinese food here for many, many year and it has always been great, also more expensive, than other restaurants. 
Haven't been for over a year and was very disappointed Last night we picked up \"take out\" and it was exceptionally BAD. Egg fu young not eatables very little filling in the spring rolls and the sweet and sour pork lack lustre. We contacted Steven at the restaurant and he challenged us that the food was made as it always is and there couldn't be anything wrong. Reluctantly he was going to credit the egg fu young to a future order but I don't think that will happen."}
{"text":"Had my brothers wedding reception here last night. Wonderful service, food and venue. The manager (Jonny) and owner (Cynthia) as well as all the other staff were so lovely and helpful every step of the way. Best chinese food in the city without a doubt. Live smooth jazz every other week to boot! Love this place. Thanks Cynthia!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Oakville, so worth the little extra in cost you pay. I've always gotten take out. The food is always fresh and so delicious. Do your self a favor and try Cynthia you will never go any were else for Chinese food again."}
{"text":"The reviews do not do this place justice, if you are going to eat very tasty freshly prepared Chinese food then you have the right place

Friends of ours recommended we try this place and we ended up going together 

Prior to going I had not heard of Cynthia's so I read a few reviews to understand more why the ratings were so low.

We were a party of 12 on a Saturday evening and of course the place was busy, did we have to wait for the food.....yes, but I will tell you it was well worth the wait 

As we had 6 children with us we didn't get to explore some of the other dishes that you would normally get into but we kept it very generic 

Everything we ate was freshly prepared and very tasty, from start to finish

I would highly recommend Cynthia's to anyone hands down!!!!!"}
{"text":"Like other people have stated previously it is okay if you like chinese food made for gringos. If you like traditional chinese food made for Chinese people, then don't come here. If you order bottled water make sure it is opened at the table."}
{"text":"Very elegant Chinese fare. Staff all wear traditional Chinese garb as they serve you. Portions are ladled onto your plate. The mango duck is to die for."}
{"text":"had the lunch set here and I was pretty satisfied. I found the service a little too formal just for lunch but I guess that's just me. The food was alright. What I appreciated is that the set came with fried rice and it they didn't serve the generic kind that normally goes with combos, it was the real deal version.

The prices were a bit higher than usual (maybe 20%) but that's what the service and ambiance gets you. All things considered, I wasn't disappointed.  I would go again but with the number of chinese restaurants around thornhill and richmond hill , it probably wont be that often."}
{"text":"I like Cynthia's, if for no other reason than it is completely accepting of its own drama.  There is a kind of theater that goes on the moment you walk through the door: waiters and waitresses in faux-satin costumes that depict everything from modern Chinese jackets to ancient flowing robes.  The carvings on the wall, the golden soup-bowl holders, the menus printed on fabric fans; it's all just a little bit cheesy, but in a way that speaks more to pageantry and decadence than it does to mockery.  Cynthia's isn't some corporate entity trying to hock Chinese culture on unwitting Canadians; it's an earnest attempt to make a restaurant into a Chinese dining experience.  Whether it succeeds or not is a question I leave to you, but I love them for the attempt.

As far as the food goes, it's good; you're paying a premium more for the atmosphere than the food.  The quality is consistent which is more than I can say for a lot of Chinese restaurants - they have an experience staff of both servers and cooks who deliver the same experience every time.  Do they have the best Peking Duck in Toronto? No.  But their Peking Duck isn't bad.  Do they have the best Chow Mein in Toronto? No.  But the Chow Mein is pretty good.  I mean, there are restaurants out there that have amazing noodle dishes but horrible rice plates - Cynthia's is neither of these; what they do, they do well, I find no complaint for their food - but it has never blown me away either."}
{"text":"Food is ok, probably better than elsewhere in Oakville but service is horrible. Spilled our drinks, waiter broke a glass and two separate server tried to get us to keep food that was covered in spilled drinks and glass.  Had to ask twice for everything and some requests never even came.  Need to spend as much time on customer service as they do the costumes."}
{"text":"We have been ordering here for a few years but I have to say this will be our last time. We placed a large order for delivery and after an hour, it still hadn't arrived. They usually are very quick so I called. No apology, I was just told it would be there in 5 minutes. 20 minutes later, it showed up and it was cold. On top of that, we were missing one dish. When I called, the woman said they could deliver it but she had no idea how long it was going to take! Our only other option was a credit on a future order."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for 20 years but I can see why it is still around. Truly authentic and truly tasteful Chinese cuisine. Service is friendly and quick. The decor is classy and feels like a restaurant from the orient. 
Will NOT wait another 20 years to return."}
{"text":"I'm not big into chinese cuisine...I mean most locations downtown are known for having cheap food...but is that really how we should measure food...of any nation?

Cynthia's is...a very good restaurant.  I always try to get hot and sour soup whenever I go to restaurants, and I always have to dump in the hot sauce to flavour it up.  It was with a surprise that I first tried the soup and was literally blown away...the flavour was amazing!!!

The food is very fast.  Granted I was there late at night but it was fresh, flavour and fast...all words that start with F and great words to describe a restaurant's food! 

Quickly now, how many \"f\"s were in that paragraph...

I had the vegetable fried rice (which I didn't even need to chew, it just dissolved in my mouth) and the General Tao Chicken...a great combination that left me satisfied :)

Overall, great service, great staff, great atmosphere and great food.  However it is in the middle of nowhere in a nondescript mall.  But this gives it a unique appeal as its a hidden gem...literally being in the middle of nowhere in a nondescript mall (deja vu...did I say that again?).

I only can't give it a 5 star because of the drinks (too much ice) and because it gives me an excuse to go there again...if they can do it again, they can have my 5 star :)"}
{"text":"I couldn't agree more with the previous reviewer, Justin.  Cynthia's is truly a GEM!
I live within Cynthia's delivery zone as well, and while the prices are 25%-40% more than you are used to paying for chinese food, Cynthia's dishes are all perfectly prepared using outstanding ingredients.

Now, like most of you, I normally eat REAL chinese now, which is either incredibly cheap and cheerful or wildly exotic and will require a second mortgage.  Cynthia's is not fusion or this type of authentic Richmond-Hill cantonese, this is the Canadian-ized chinese food of your youth, but MUCH BETTER than even you imagined it could ever be!  

My first impression of Cynthia's food was that someone hired a 5-star chef to re-create gourmet versions of the cheesy chinese dishes of my youth.

Sweet and sour shrimp (prawns) are $12 instead of 7.95, but these are huge shrimp closer in size to a lobster tail than the scrawny things typically found, with a perfect batter and sauce on the side.

You want (bean-sprout) chicken chow mein? They serve the most delicious version you've ever had, with so much chicken it's almost too much!  

Like Lemon Chicken? An unbelievably huge box that must contain two large, whole batter-fried chicken breasts arrive with a wedge of lemon and old-school electric-yellow lemon sauce.  Personally, I skip the sauce and squeeze the lemon only, but it's fantastic in that bad-for-you way!

How about fried rice?  Boring stuff right?  Not Cynthia's!  This fried rice is so good you won't want to ruin it by letting any sauce get anywhere near it!  And I really enjoyed the old-school egg rolls, full of bean sprouts, with those crispy pinched ends.  Delicious with their home-made hot mustard (HOT!) or pedestrian plum sauce.

Seriously, if you're like me and find that going back to sample the gulty pleasures of your past is always a huge disappointment, and those restaurants you used to love never stand up to your memory of them, check this place out - you'll find that this is one time that you really can \"go home\" and be impressed with those dishes of your youth."}
{"text":"Very strange overall experience.

We had a reservation for 9 people (plus a high chair). They had asked my mom on the phone is there was a special occasion, she indicated it was her birthday but there was never any sign of them having a reason to have asked --- they didn't do anything for it.  We asked for a high chair but the table they led me too didn't have one, so I had to ask again.  The room was quite cold, definitely should focus more on room temperature and less on useless ornate decorations.

Menu was expensive given the quality and the location.  Still had a greasy, slimy \"take out\" Chinese food taste, despite the formalized service (which doesn't mean good).  I liked the wonton soup and tempura-style broccoli and mushrooms best (although quite salty).  Fortune cookies + Ovatation sticks a nice touch.  

Rather eat Chinese food downtown."}
{"text":"Peking duck is why I go here. Nobody does it better than these guys. The decor is very special as are the staff that dresses up in authentic formal Chinese garb. A little expensive but a great place to go for a treat."}
{"text":"My number one choice for takeout Chinese has become my kids' favourite dine-in experience. The welcome is always warm, the service is fantastic and the food is great. If you are looking for a classic \"Chinese food\" experience, I highly recommend Cynthia's.
Favourite dishes include Wonton Soup served in golden bowls (my daughter likes dry noodles on the side), lemon chicken, Shanghai noodles, lettuce wraps, and more! 
Portions are really generous and we always over order for enough for lunch the next day. It's not cheap but the quality is high."}
{"text":"I will never return to this place. We went for NYE dinner, the service was TERRIBLE and we were rushed to leave MULTIPLE times while eating so they could accommodate more people. The waiter tried to take away our food when we were STILL working on it.  Food was very average but Very pricey, probably paying for their fancy decor. When we paid our bills, the waitress selected 15% tips on the interact machine - which is absurd, isn't this the customer's discretion?? This is the first 1/5 star rating I have given on Yelp and I would give lower if I could."}
{"text":"Some dishes are good and others are very good. BBQ sliced pork, crispy ok beef or chicken , Chow mien, and the beef broccoli are my favourites. More expensive then other Chinese restaurants but you pay for what you get."}
{"text":"I have to update my review and give Cynthia's another star.  We have been ordering consistently from them for the past few months. The BBQ pork rice is the best rice to order and much better seasoned than the chicken.  We usually order fried rice from Spoon & Fork which is directly across the street both are good but Cynthia's BBQ pork fried rice has the edge."}
{"text":"Because most of the restaurants were closed tonight in my neighborhood, Cynthia's was the only choice. And, am I ever glad it was. The food was perfect- flavorful, hot, crunchy veggies, and just the right amount of spice. Service was professional maybe even a touch over the top but in a good way.  We hadn't been to Cynthia's for many years,  and it was even better than we remembered."}
{"text":"I came to Cynthia's Chinese restaurants as my friend told me there is live electric piano and singing. I came in not expecting the food to be good and thinking .. in order to check out the live music, I will have to order the Canadianized Chinese food, chicken balls? General Tao chicken? I walked in.. it reminded me of being back at Jumbo restaurant in Hong Kong with the decorations and the waitress and waiter in Chinese clothing. 
I ordered the egg white with crab meat and beside from it was a little oily, the flavour was good. They also used real crab meat, instead of the pollack fish fake crab meat. We also ordered a satay beef and vermicelli casserole. The flavour was also pretty good, and last but not least, we ordered a crab claw. It was not bad. So overall experience, surprisingly better than expected. Very good and attentive service, they keep refilling my water without having to ask. We were even thinking of taking our parents back to try again!"}
{"text":"Came here over the Xmas holidays with family, about 8 of us. I never usually go to Oakville for Chinese food,  and actually never have, but based on this experience I'd be afraid to do so again. I'm sure there are good Chinese restaurants there though..

My overall experience wasn't the best. The restaurant was freezing, and the food was mediocre at best. The hot and sour soup tasted like ketchup, the general Tao and fried squid  were super salty. Best thing we had was the Peking duck. I can get better Chinese food for much less in Chinatown in Toronto and even food courts in Markham /Richmond Hill. I should have known the food wouldn't be good, seeing how we were the only non-typical Oakville resident there. Lol

The place has nice decor I'll give them that, but can't really enjoy it when you're freezing."}
{"text":"I am not Chinese, but I have been to China and this place reminds me of some of the fancy themed restaurants there.   The staff wear colourful traditional tribal costumes.  They are extremely attentive.  The decor is themed, almost to the level of Rainforest Cafe, but more mature.  I have never seen a Chinese restaurant in Canada with this much going on visually (although you can find much more than in China).

My good friends in-laws visited  from Beijing and were treated to may restaurant meals, yet this place was the only place they liked. They are very picky.

The style and cuisine are a bit of condradictions, but work.  The owner is apparently is a very nice Cantonese lady, yet the cuisine is not more Northern Chinese style. Yet the costumes are from Western China.  I would not have been aware of this but was informed by my friends.

The food was excellent.  Even the fried Tofu (which is very simple and plain dish) was done very well, and I went back for thirds...which is saying a lot for Tofu.

The staff seem to be specialized in singing Karaoke \"Happy Birthday\" along with a video presentation.  It's very quirky or kitschy!  It's super fun if you have good sense of humour. 

I am going to check out their other locations, and hopefully they are just as good."}
{"text":"Visited Cynthia's after being there last almost 15 years ago! The place looks great and service is awesome, sometimes it was a little overbearing!
This is definitely a high end looking place and the prices will reflect that, the quality of food however is very good.
While I felt our server was heavy on the suggestive selling, especially on drinks, they ease up when they know who've heard enough. 
We ordered the pork belly special, mongolian chicken, and indonesian style noodles, along with a half litre of the house white (server tried to convince me to take a $45 dollar bottle instead!!). 
The food comes out quick and they will serve each guest which adds to the specialty of this place. The pork belly dish was amazing as well as the other two. Portions are good but compared to other places they could give you a touch more to reflect the price.
I noticed a lot of regulars, so it is definitely a local favorite. Soon be back here."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a tasteful Chinese dining experience then this place is perfect.  However, if you want an authentic Chinese meal, just keep looking... probably not in Oakville. I would suggest Mississauga or Toronto.  Please don't interpret this review the wrong way, the food is good.  Some dishes were actually very good. But I've had the same or better for much less because it didn't include the costumed servers and the Asian decor.  As an example, the won ton soup was presented in a silver serving dish with a sliding dome top (think of the chilled silver butter dishes you see when you go for afternoon tea - yeah, that size). Unfortunately what was revealed was a tiny bowl containing a bland broth and two teeny tiny won ton. I think it was around $5 for that.  

So, just to recap - I would recommend this place if you want an elegant \"dining experience\". If on the other hand you just want an authentic Chinese meal that is just as good but without the showiness, try driving a few miles eastward."}
{"text":"Very solid place. The shrimp dishes are 6 massive jumbo prawns.. Cleaned, deveined etc... Sizzling pepper beef also very tasty.. Only issue is they changed their lemon chicken a couple years ago and I'm still bitter about it."}
{"text":"Get the Peking Duck....no wait don't, cause if you do, they bang a gong and announce it!  Busy place.  Lots of noise from bells on waiters costumes.  Food good.  Very clean.  They have takeout.  Kind of like the Rainforest Cafe in Niagara, things hanging from ceiling, lots of ancient Chinese artistry.  Food comes out one at a time.  Ask for a seat by the window."}
{"text":"Such a cute place, and the food is REALLY good. They've been there 8 or so years now? Dumplings, alongside bbq pork, Chinese broccoli, and noodle dishes. It's comfort food to the max. 

I recommend eating in the restaurant when you are trying to fill a void within yourself for kitsch-entertainment. The ambience will not disappoint. 

It is also a good take-out spot with pretty good prices. Definitely love eating leftovers from Cynthia's!"}
{"text":"If you love Canadian style Chinese food (ie everything is bland, greasy and deep fried) you will love this place. Me, I would rather get a root canal than eat here. The fact that it is busy is a testament that the average Joe will really stuff anything down their throats."}
{"text":"first time having delivery from this restaurant and i was pretty disappointed. ordered szechuan shrimp which was predominantly sliced onions. General tao chicken was good. I ordered hot and sour soup but got some vegetable soup. I much prefer this restaurant over Mr dumpling, which is what I have also been ordering for delivery for the past month or so in newmarket.
UPDATE I got delivery on February 25. Got the schezuan shrimp and shrimp rolls. I got food poisoning that night. I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Awesome!

I wanted a Chinese dinner but in the Canyon Creek style which means service and a higher level of style

Order Peking Duck and they bang a gong and make a big deal of it which is funny

They have so many staff looking after you it becomes funny

They drape the knapkin,  a cocktail waitress takes your drink order that's printed on a fan

The maitre d takes your order

Everything is upscale and service is very attentive

Food was very good and yes pricing is a bit more than a food court but hey live like a VIP and enjoy being brad and Angelina for a day

Come on who gets hot and sour in a Chinese gold book?  Donald Trump and I that's who

Finish your meal with fortune cookies,  chocolates and a wrap cloth to clean your hands

Sorry had to add this

Some one celebrated some anniversary and the maitre d and hostess sang a song for them with video and then jumped into happy birthday for little Bobby

This made the evening so much more fun for everyone"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever gotten. They lost a regular customer tonight. Dear Cynthia change your staff( John and sisilia) , they are ruining your restaurant."}
{"text":"Second time eating here and ordered Cantonese style sweet and sour chicken since we can't get it back in the US and it was horrible. Had no flavor and was poorly done. You could see they put no effort into it as you could still see the breaded chicken. Not to mention the cost was $17 and when you looked on the bill they charged us $3 for rice which I didn't even ask for."}
{"text":"They hover over you like flys on shit too grab a plate 

How many dishes do they have 

Food is passable kinda greasy but nice atmosphere 

Great for children"}
{"text":"Normally I would have to travel to downtown Toronto for any decent Chinese food until I found Cynthia's.  The service is excellent and the food is great.  I love their salted dry spicy lobster, which is not on the menu, but if you ask they will make for you."}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. The level and quality of customer service is insanely high for food at such a low and affordable price. Not to mention it looks beautiful and the food is great!

I recommend you go."}
{"text":"Seriously, the staff at the restaurant provide some of the best customer service and appreciation I have witnessed at an establishment in a long time. But of course, that's just the icing on the cake. I've tasted the crispy OK beef, the Mongolian beef and the sweet and sour chicken (off menu) as well as the mango spring rolls (addictive!) and everything was delicious (most of it was recommended by host too which is a bonus). The prices are reasonable and you get a large portion of food at great quality which is not always easy to find (so I can appreciate this place even more!!). The decor is traditional and beautifully ornate to match the server's and host's traditional garb. Bathroom - A+. This would be a lovely restaurant to host a larger group for a celebration as there are private dinner areas to reserve and some sort of classy lounge downstairs. Very impressed and would recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered this last night for takeout.  Since we are in the area we wanted something quick and easy.  Takeout here is never good.  By the time you start eating all their dishes basically become a soup.  It's a fun restaurant to eat at with the funny hats, and clothes.  You know a Chinese food place isn't that good when no Chinese people are eating there.  Not one asian to be seen there except the staff.  So many better options along HWY 7.  There really isn't one item on their menu that I love.  Overpriced for basically Manchu wok quality.  If your ordering it for takeout it's not worth it at all.  Just close already and make room for better things."}
{"text":"The environment was fantastic. The place was decorated with tradition Chinese style. And the food was relatively good, but just too expensive."}
{"text":"I love the quality of the food, the ambiance is great and the service is very prompt and proper.  We ordered many dishes, nothing ever disappoints me, the take out family dinner menu is also great for get togethers and is easy when you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"I wouldn't feed this food to my dog!

I have to say I have never been this Harsh in my life about a restaurant but the meal I just attempted to swallow was horrible...

The Ginger beef was like left overs from the garbage with some Ginger thrown on top, to the point the smell was so strong and the taste was impossible to swallow.

The chicken balls were overcooked with chicken that was not so nice and the sweet and sour sauce was pure ketchup and smelled like vinegar!

The chicken fried rice was hard and tasted like cooked eggs, where the 
hell was the chicken?

The spring rolls were the smallest things I can seen in my life, one bite and it's gone... Tasteless as well

I feel guilty having to force one star on this restaurant as it deserves nothing, not to mention their customer service skills are lacking. 

You think if you called to complain how disgusting their food was they would at least say \"sorry to hear\". Instead they said \"we make no mistakes, our food is fine.\"

Oh and by the way, don't try to get your money back or even try to 
explain to these people, they just ignore you. I told them it's not right for me to pay 50 bucks for food I can't eat and if I could return it, their response was \"it's your, it's not fair, no return, no money back\" what's not fair is I just spent 50 bucks down the toilet for something that ended up in the garbage chute.

I think if they had better customer service skills, things would of been better...."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years, and the quality is consistently excellent. 

The Peking Duck, in particular, is a highlight. I think you need to order it in advance (we always do when we make our reservation) and the execution and service of the duck is top notch. For the first course, they bring out the cooked duck and slice off thin strips of tender meat clinging to that beautiful crisp skin, and then serve it for you in soft, thin pancakes with cucumber, scallion and a blob of hoisin sauce. (I always add extra hoisin to mine, but hey, I'm a saucy gal.) So ducking good! For the second course, they pull the remaining duck meat off the bone, stir fry it with chopped veg and seasoning (and crispy noodles I think) and serve it wrapped in a crunchy piece of iceberg lettuce. (I always add a bunch of hoisin to that, too). Holy duck, that is good eatin'.

Pretty much all other Chinese dishes we've ordered here have been delicious as well...too many to name. But shout-out to the little bowls of wonton soup, which my Dad particularly enjoys.

True, this place is expensive (check out the price of their egg rolls...I mean, they're delicious, but still)...and they do pour a stingy martini...but, it's still a big step up from your average Chinese restaurant in terms of ambiance, which is probably why a lot of people choose to celebrate their birthdays here (my Dad typically does, and anytime we're here, we usually hear a few renditions of the birthday song over the course of the night lol). The wait staff outfitted in traditional Chinese garb is also a nice touch, as is the resident keyboardist/singer who plays a nice mix of classics and oldies most weekends (don't forget to tip him a few bucks). 

All in all, recommended!"}
{"text":"My co-workers made reservations for our Christmas Lunch this year. I have driven past this restaurant multiple times but never thought to try it. We had a large group and the service was very nice. The interior decoration was very Asian, kind of like something you would see in a movie. 

We had a large group and they did a good job to try to have all of the food arrive at the same time. Most of us order food on sizzling plates so the food is served very hot but also coils down much more quickly. They also noticed after serving that two or my co workers portions were smaller then the rest and was nice enough to cook a complimentary extra plate.

The food was decent, a little salty but overall the experience was very enjoyable.I would probably come back with co workers but not alone."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to give this place a 3 star as I didn't try their famous Peking duck..... but everything else that we ordered were really just \"okay\". I am Taiwanese so I know good Chinese food. This place is a Canadian Chinese w a high end price tag. Lots of frequent returning locals here. Their service was quite good though. Very attentive and friendly. However, I thought it was weird that I tried speaking mandarin to the staff there, they spoke English back. They obviously speak Chinese because I could hear them talking so loud in the kitchen. Overall good was mediocre. You're paying for their fancy decor (like in a movie what a typical Chinese restaurant would look like in NYC?) , the fancy dinnerware, utensil, and people dressed in dynasty era costumes. Cultural appropriation to its best. I'd save your money to go to other more high end Chinese restaurants it will give you bigger and better food. I'm giving it a 2 star but because of its service I'm giving it a 3."}
{"text":"Wonderful. Just wonderful. Service was excellent, the food was delicious. We had the banquet for 2, they happily substituted an item for us and they were very attentive to our food allergies. They also have gluten free option so we can take our gluten sensitive son here. Top notch!"}
{"text":"The service is spectacular.  The food comes steaming hot and fresh within minutes of ordering.  The decor is a little cheesey, over the top asian ornate, but definitely cool.
It may be pricey, but it's well worth it because the quality is better than any chinese food you'll ever eat.  Fresh, crispy, and you feel good after eating it!"}
{"text":"We popped into this restaurant mainly because there was a 20-minute wait at their sister buffet restaurant. We were amused by the costumes worn by the serving staff and I appreciated that care had been taken with the decor. It may seem kitschy to some but I appreciate the effort put into creating the warm, inviting atmosphere. Yes they charge more than you would normally pay for the quality of food that they serve but we did have a tea light under our teapot keeping it nice and warm and the gentleman who brought our dishes actually served the food onto our plates, which I rather enjoyed. I also liked how they sounded the gong before serving the duck! The food was nothing to write home about but overall we had a lovely evening and would probably go back."}
{"text":"Very nice and quiet. Excellent food! Ordered the dinner for 4 deluxe as there were four people in our group. The soup was amazing! And I absolutely loved the pad Thai! I felt this was better than other Thai restaurants I have been.  The stairs going down to the washrooms could have been more lit as it was a little touch and go the first steps down.  Impressed with wine list and the wine itself.  The jasmine tea was excellent t tasting and came with a flower inside."}
{"text":"Recently had a lovely evening at Cynthia's. The decor and traditional dress of the staff is charming. We were in a large group, and service was nicely paced and food served piping hot. The three soups we had were wonderful: wonton, sweet and sour and chicken/ corn. My favourite dish was the lemon chicken, which was crisp and flavourful. I highly recommend Cynthia's for a special night out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Life has a few moments when you lose all faith and admiration in other human beings, my latest experience at Cynthia's is a prime example of one of those moments. 

We ordered the crispy Ok chicken for pickup and expected that Cynthia's would be able to meet the standard of adequate dining that we expect. We were appalled when we received Ok beef several of us do not eat beef so we called Cynthia's in hopes of getting the acceptable meal we payed for.

At this point we were already aware that our meal would be sub par on several different levels. After working through the poor communication skills of the woman on the phone they agreed to give us our well deserved chicken, they then had the audacity to demand the beef back, in trade for the chicken. 

The delivery man stomped away with the beef which began to beg the question, was another customer going to be victimized and receive a beef order with around 30 percent missing, let alone the limitless amount of possible germs they were being exposed to? 

We had hoped that the utter disappointment was over, our hopes were not remotely met as we moved on to the noodles, we had ordered the crispy chicken noodles which makes it complety unacceptable when the noodles were soft, soggy and the distinct opposite of crispy. If the texture was the only flaw perhaps we cod have forgiven for the noodles, unfortunately that was simply not the case. We had only received around 2-3 small pieces of chicken In the entire dish,  we took the deficiency of chicken as a cheap display by Cynthia's. The noodles were also severely lacking in Flavour, they were borderline tasteless and brought a disappointing ending to a terrible meal. 

I had to write this review so that I can share my woes with anyone that will listen. This is a unacceptable display of customer dissatisfaction and I shall not stand for it."}
{"text":"I gave 3 stars because the dishes, while pretty good, were pricey.  Charged $3 for a bowl of rice and $5 for tea for 3 of us.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"The food quality was great! It's a casual place where you see a good mix of families an couples. The experience is very cool and makes you feel like you're in another country. Servers are a bit slow on service, but are very polite and very willing to help once they do come over. Average drink prices, average drink menu- food is very fresh and very tasty. When you order a whole Peking duck they bang the gong and announce it before cutting the duck up and serving you. For your birthday they announce it on the TV and then sing to you in English and Chinese. Overall it was an excellent experience and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food was average. Getting hit with a $1 'weekend' fee that was not advertised was unacceptable. There were only my wife and I and one other couple in the restaurant for lunch so it's not as if space was at a premium. Left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"The food was good . Eggs roll was fantastic. Tried the hot and sour soup - much to sweet for me. But the mains where great . My favourite was the Kung pow chicken. My kids especially enjoyed the atmosphere and so did we with them. It was a little pricey but I enjoyed and would go back. We all left happy ."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for our anniversary dinner. We decided to try this place out because we saw that the reviews were good. However, we were disappointed for many reasons. We ordered 2 soups and it took 45 mins to come out. The rest of the food that we ordered took another 35 mins after that. Every table around us were also sitting and waiting around. They were either lacking staff or they just don't know how to operate efficiently but I don't recommend anyone to come here unless you're willing to wait forever. If you're hungry, you will get frustrated and want to leave to go somewhere else to eat. The food was also mediocre. I ordered crab meat soup and there was not a single crab meat in it and it was very watered down. Congee queen is way better. This place targets Caucasians who can't tell the difference between authentic quality Chinese food. We personally won't come back here and we're giving our honest opinion in hopes it will help others."}
{"text":"I went to Cynthia's in Oakville over the weekend and I also dine at Cynthia's in Thornhill several times (not by choice). We ordered: special house fried rice, general Tao chicken, vegetable beef, crispy wonton, green beans and two beverages. I was dissatisfied with the quality of the food and it was a little over price compare to the typical Chinese restaurant. The decoration of the restaurant is traditional and that was nice. This place gets over hype up and I am the type of person that is willing and happy to pay for quality. I've been to smaller less \"well known\" Chinese restaurants and the quality of the food is great and priced reasonably. Sadly Cynthia's does not meet my expectations and as I'm writing this I've come to a decision and I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Cynthia's was fabulous! I am not a fan of Chinese food... This was unique, flavour full, good quality meat (beef tenderloin, chicken breast, shrimp, calamari) the service was impeccable, the atmosphere over the top but crazy fun! We thoroughly had a great dinner here and would go back!."}
{"text":"Worst chinese restaurant I have ever been to. The service was terrible, the server was chewing gum and seemed like he had better things to do. Got this 'salesperson' vibe from all of them because they were constantly adding in stuff without telling us the price. (We ordered peking duck and wanted the lettuce wrap after for 8, but apparently the dish only comes with 6 wraps so he charged us two dollars extra for two more SLICES OF LETTUCE) The portions were terrible, although they did come on fancy dishes, it does not excuse the lack of food for the price let alone the poor quality of it. Overall I would never come back nor would I recommend anyone come here."}
{"text":"Called in and ordered a combination plate, and when I got there, it was the wrong combination so I had to wait an extra 10 mins.

The food is not bad, got the chicken balls, garlic beef and chicken fried rice and it also comes with a veggie egg roll and spring roll.

The garlic beef was really good, but needed more meat and less onions and green beans as filler, everything else was just average."}
{"text":"The worst! The so called \"honey garlic ribs\" are grey, greasy, tough, filled with fat and inedible. The fried rice is pale and tasteless. Crispy beef was barely edible. Just dreadful. What a waste of money!"}
{"text":"Cynthia's has always been a personal point of contention. One side of me loves the greasy, salty, heavy, Canadianized Chinese cuisine that brings back nostalgic memories of take-out and movies. But the foodie in me can't call this Chinese food with a clear conscious. Cynthia's has been a institution in Thornhill since forever, and I don't think any resident in the area hasn't been at least a handful of times for some chicken balls or fried rice. But if you're in the market for real deal Chinese food, head over to Leslie and Hwy 7."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years now, and have yet to have a bad experience. 

We usually come here for the lunch specials, but have been here for dinner on occasion too. The lunch specials consist of soup, rice, and a main. For between $7-$17. I like the Szechwan chicken with fried rice and hot & sour soup, $8, I could eat that forever it's so good, but the portions are a decent size for the price and we have never left hungry.  When we have come for dinner everything we've ordered has been perfect, from fried rice to lemon chicken, soups, veggies, and Cantonese chow mein, we've loved it all. 

The price point for dinner is a bit high, that's why we try to get here in time for the lunch specials. Being close by to where my parents live I'm sure we'll be back here again in the near future, and looking forward to it."}
{"text":"From the outside, Cynthia's is quite unassuming - tucked into a strip of quietly forlorn shops in the parking lot of Promenade Mall.  It's another story entirely when you step inside - you'll notice a portico right out of a Chinese temple, delicate bush cherry adornments and a ceiling of twinkling lights that immediately indicate you're in for a special treat.

And then you're escorted to your table by hosts in authentic Dynasty-period dress - tables set carefully with your chopsticks resting on little gold chopstick holders while a drink menu awaits, printed on Chinese fans.  The attention to detail really jumps out at you.

Food-wise, Cynthia's features a solid selection of Chinese fare typical to North American Chinese restaurants - I say this because I can't vouch for how authentically Chinese it is, seeing as I am not Chinese, nor have I ever been to China.  They also include a few continental and pan-Asian items for good measure.

We ordered a variety of items, and all showed up quickly, exquisitely presented on fancy dishware - hot & sour soup, egg rolls, Singapore vermicelli, sweet & sour chicken balls, General Tao chicken,  Mongolian beef.  And god were they all good - and not one item felt cheap or slapped together.  The kitchen staff obviously take pride in their work.

I should make special mention of the service - there are so many staff, it's actually unreal - it seems like a 1:1 staff to customer ratio.  There were at LEAST two managers on the floor at all times tonight, wearing dark suits.  And managers and staff alike wait on you.  All of them.  Someone is ALWAYS hovering just off camera waiting to fill up your water glass, remove empty plates or take a special request.  It's absurd how welcome they make you feel and I love every minute of it.

By the end of this massive meal, I and my two dining companions were thoroughly stuffed so we couldn't do dessert, but they do have a selection of staple Asian desserts (Lychee seems to feature prominently on their dessert menu) with occasional specials (tonight was some sort of berry cheesecake).

I'll be honest: the place isn't cheap - the meal cost us nearly $100, without alcohol.  But for special occasions or for a superlative dining experience that will equal or best just about any other Chinese restaurant in Toronto that I'm aware of, Cynthia's is worth a visit.  And then you'll keep coming back - of this, I am certain."}
{"text":"I love this place. My Dad always took me here when he lived in the area and I'm so glad I was introduced to Chinese food other than the Mandarin (haha). 

I love the decor inside, the staff are all dressed up and it feels very authentic. The food comes fast and tastes wonderfully fresh. I've never had a bad experience at this restaurant. The almond soo-guy and beef fried rice are WONDERFUL. I love when someone orders Peking Duck because it's a big deal and gets announced. 

Another great thing is when you pay with cash, you get back Cynthia's 'bucks' to use next time. A good incentive to return, as if the food wasn't enough."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about these other reviewers experiences either, but every time I've come here (which is about 8+ times) I've always had wonderful experiences.

Our usual order consisted of spring rolls (crispy and always tastes fresh), chicken soo guy, beef fried rice and some sort of vegetable dish. I've always loved the food here! 

I also love the decor and atmosphere at Cynthia's. The staff are all in costume and it's just a little more special than the usual uniforms, and the service has always been great. It's also a very clean establishment, with the waitstaff armed with dustbusters (!) to clean up the area. If you pay with cash, you get 10% back in Cynthia Bucks, which is pretty neat getting something for basically doing nothing but paying your bill. 

If you're lucky, someone will order the Peking Duck and a big deal is made with it, they bang a gong and someone announces \"PEKING DUCK!\". They also have a cheesy video they play on a giant TV for birthdays which is pretty awesome.

Love this place."}
{"text":"This is a Hi-End Chinese restaurant. Why anyone would pay the prices that they charge, is beyond me. I guess that to dress their staff in 'Old-World' Chinese costumes, it costs them a lot, so they pass on their costs to their customers. Food was nicely presented, but for the price, it really wasn't anything special. There are so many good, tasty and reasonably priced Chinese restaurants within a ten minute drive, that its beyond my comprehension why you would come here. And the only reason I came, was that I was invited."}
{"text":". This is sub standard Canadian Chinese food. So incredibly bland.
Asked server what the extra $1 on the bill was. That's a charge for the tablecloth! I was flabbergasted! Apparently they don't use tablecloths during the week and charge for their use on weekends. Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"So for chinese food in general I would have to give it a 2 or 3. The food tasted alright but is definitely catered to a white audience and is so overpriced. 

We spent $45 on three small take out containers. The same items, but bigger portions would have cost about $25 at conngee queen and other comparable restaurants. 

I am giving it 4 stars bc they offer gluten free options that are prepared in a washed wok with cleaned utensils. I trust that they take good measures in their kitchen to avoid cross contact  as I did not get sick at all after eating. So for that reason alone, and since there are really no other places I can get celiac safe chinese food, they get 4 stars. 

We ordered the 

mushroom fried rice - really good! we added hot sauce at home and it was perfect

singapore noodles - edible but not great. they didn't mix the curry sauce in properly so there were clumps of fry powdery sauce and overall the dish lacked anything special

garlic chinese broccoli - also really good! crisp and not super oily with lots of garlic. 

I would order the rice and broccoli again. 

So although not cheap at all for chinese food, it was still quite good and a really great alternative for celiacs or anyone looking for gluten free options. The staff were also very polite and helpful."}
{"text":"Came here last night for a friend's birthday party.
I must say I was impressed with the decor, ambiance and with the traditional outfits several of the waiters and waitresses dressed in.

The food was actually very tasty and good!
The Chinese food was authentic and not too 'Canadianized'.

It will be a repeat for me for this place if I am in the area."}
{"text":"We just had my sisters and aunts bridal celebration here and it was FANTASTIC!!
We rented out the private room in the back! We had around 25-30 people and it was the perfect size! 
A couple of round tables and room to walk around and mingle!
Servers were amazing and very attentive!
Delicious food! 
Great presentation!
Order the jasmine tea- comes with blooming flower so cool !!
Very fun!!"}
{"text":"This is an okay option for Chinese food if you are in the area. Lunch menus have good selection and ok value. Food, however, is not quite authentic Chinese , very westernized. Portion is a bit on the small size. 
I prefer Cynthia's Paradise buffet instead, more expensive but much more selections and better for groups"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 5/5 very nice set up I loved it a lot. 

Service: 4/5 above average. Really cool uniforms. 

Food: 3/5 very average to a lot of Chinese restaurants in Mississauga and Scarborough/Richmond hill and Markham. There are better places but just not in Oakville. 

Price: 2/5 this was where I was a little shook. I know there aren't many decent Chinese food places in Oakville but I think this place is taking advantage of that and milking it. Their prices are so high and the food is average. Just drive 15 mins in to mississauga and you will find much better tasting Chinese food. That isn't to say this place doesn't taste good I just don't think it justifies the price. Maybe because it's fluffed up with its presentation?! Either way I would go to mississauga."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant on and off since we moved into the Richmond Hill area 16 years ago. Tonight on our way back from the hospital and being Labour Day we thought we would call them to see if they were open. So I got Siri going and got the number. I dialed it and asked if they were open. The lady on the phone said that they were very busy and that I should make a reservation. I did and off we went. When we got there the first clue that something was amiss was that the place was nearly deserted and they could not find my reservation. We took our seat and proceeded to order. Not five minutes into this and we get a call from a local number, it was the first restaurant we called wondering where we were. As it turns out the owners of Cynthia's created a tangent restaurant called Cynthia's Paradise and put it literally right next door. Talk about confusing your market. Given the way the night was going to unfurl we should have packed up and gone next door.

I ordered the Hot and Sour Soup to start. This is one of my favourites and when I looked at the $4.95 price tag I assumed we were going to get a bowl big enough to share. When it came I got this little golden globe before me which revealed inside an even smaller ceramic bowl which if it held 1 cup of soup I would have been amazed. The soup was adequate. It has a nice balance of all the flavours I am used to but in no way was this worth 5 dollars. I mean for just one dollar more at another chinese restaurant I got a bowl of soup so large that it would have filled that little bowl before me 20 times over. What really drove the point home though was the little tiny $3.50 Egg Roll and the 2 HarGow for $4.50. This place was way over priced. So maybe the service was going to be exceptional. I mean, there were more people on the floor, behind the counter and that could be seen in the kitchen than there were patrons sitting at the tables. The 2 HarGow came one at a time in the tiniest steam boxes I have ever seen. We ordered Moo Shu Pork, Chinese Broccoli and the House Special Fried Rice. The food took way longer to get to us than was comfortable for me but taste wise it was very good. Far too expensive but very good. Ended the meal with the Deep Fried Creme Brulee and with a 13% tip the meal came out to $94.75.

Frankly I can think of a number of places that I would like to spend that kind of money for 2 people. Cynthia's Chinese Restaurant is no longer one of those. As a comparison the meal at Cynthia's Paradise would have cost $54 for two people all you can eat. I will do a review of Paradise when I go there but this place will never see another dime from me."}
{"text":"The worst place ever! We ordered \"dinner for two\" expecting, as usual that the price is for 2 people...but they charged the amount for one person each...we paid double for nothing! The food was ok and so not worth it! DONT GO, EVER!"}
{"text":"Upon entering, we were greeted right away by staff dressed in traditional northern CHINESE attire.  Friendly, courteous and attentive. Busy on the Saturday night.  Waited only 10 minutes for a table to seat 9. Glad I called ahead. 
We were seated at 8.45pm.  They open till 11pm sat night. 
Food had good presentation as they were decorated with carved flowers, birds and other figures.  Staff served and plated food , which was nice.  Most Chinese restaurants only do partial service.  
Pricing was slightly higher but they made up in other ways.  
We had spring rolls, shrimp rolls, Peking duck, chicken fried rice with salted fish, seafood chow mien, general tso chicken, seafood in birds nest and Chinese tea.  

Great place to bring friends and family.  I was expecting less from the poor reviews but was really happy with our experience."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this great restaurant 2 stars is due to how awful the service was tonight. 

I have been coming exclusively to Cynthias in Oakville for take out,delivery and dine in service for years! Everything has always been fresh tasty and friendly. However tonight I opted to order online. As you check out, the option to automatically tip is there, being *savvy* with technology I thought it to be a cool new option and tried it out. 

Honest mistake, the tip didn't go through. Now, as someone who has worked in service I would never intentionally leave nothing. I understand that it how servers in any capacity survive. 

I wouldn't have known at all had the driver Not called my house, twice, to inform me. 

The first call I got was rude, short and accusatory. Though I did apologize and explained what must of happened I was met with responses like \"next time if you don't want to tip, just get pick up, I had to drive ten minutes in the snow just for you\"
Shocked I hung up, appalled that Cynthias was capable of such behaviour.

Then a second call because apparently the delivery driver wasn't satisfied with what he said the first time. And this was the kicker. After saying sorry a SECOND time explaining that it was a mistake, (not that I should have to) I was told, and I quote \"don't lie, don't you go to church on Sunday? Have some respect for your elders\"

This will go down as the worst customer service I have ever received. I have never been one to not tip in service, it was once how I made my living. But after all of this nonsense you've lost a customer and any good rating, let alone a good tip for this evening."}
