{"text":"Just enjoyed a great dinner of house salad and chicken. The produce was fresh and the fixings were not overpowering. Hubby enjoyed a burger which also got high marks. Our guests enjoyed the not your mom's grilled cheese and soup. Good drinks and attentive service. Will come back to try the pasta. Give this place a try."}
