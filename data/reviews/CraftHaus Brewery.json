{"text":"CraftHaus is run the way a brewery should be. Steve, the brewer and bartender is extremely nice and welcoming. 
They have not been open for a full year yet so they are still building up their beer list but they come out with different tweaked beers all the time and have \"firkin Fridays\" every week so you can always try something new. 
If you are a beer fan you have to check out CraftHaus or at least order a pint when you see it around town, their beer is really good."}
{"text":"LOVING this place! Decided to try out a few more breweries as we are only a few months into our Vegas residency. Being from Tampa, I'm used to craft beer places although my favorite are the intimate, everybody-knows-your-name ones. THIS one is the first that really made me feel like I was back home and yet still has its own unique and welcoming atmosphere. The bartender, Nick, was such a nice guy! He made my visiting parents have a wonderful experience and even offered to take our picture by the sign. Especially appreciate that they do Swap Thursdays where everyone brings beer from other areas that can't be bought in Vegas. SO COOL! Can't wait to bring some Cigar City samples in!"}
{"text":"I used to go to a different brewery, partly because I lived on that side of town. Now I have discovered this gem. Great staff who always make you feel like a regular, and amazing beer; centerpiece sour, English rye ipa, and the saison are all amazing. Stop by and grab a pint or two, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time at Crafhaus. It's a very intricate environment with great energy. I'll be back.."}
{"text":"Saizon rocks , the booze district is very very cool. I'm very fortunate to work right next door to these guys I get to watch them make beer daily I've never been a big fan of hoppy beer but their IPA is exquisite do yourself a favor if you live out Henderson stop by and have a beer"}
{"text":"Super nice people! Nice place with a relaxed atmosphere. Have tasted a few of their beers and have been satisfied with all so far. Always clean and really like the way it's decorated. Pomegranate Saison was delicious and Resolute Rye was too. Looking forward to the Coconut Stout and Fall Maple Spice!"}
{"text":"Great little brewery. Some very solid choices available, and a nice little location. Only thing I would love is if they had a patio area."}
{"text":"Ben the Beard is a wonderful and spunky soul behind the bar!!! He has the greatest dance moves you will ever see. Get yourself down here for amazing beers, great service, and happy times. Ben the Beard will take great care of you."}
{"text":"I've been to Crafthaus multiple times now. It's a fact that's reflected in my review that there's an ambiance and a sense of familiarity that keeps drawing me back. 

My first encounter was fraught with frustration trying to find the brewery. It's tucked away on the back side of the warehouses and my friend and I search with inhuman determination to find a new brewery. Our plan: stop at Crafthaus, try what they have to offer, and then head over to Bad Beat Brewery. The beer was so tasty and the conversation so good (staff and owners included) we didn't leave till they were locking up. 

The decorations around the drinking hall each have a story and a purpose. Each seasonal beer is accompanied by a new chalk mural that temporarily graces the drinking area until it's moved to the innards of the building when a new mural replaces it. There is more history of the brewery itself on the walls, ceiling, and to lounge with; but to know those secrets, you have to be curious enough to ask. 

I've visited enough to see repeat local faces, meet the owners, meet the owners' friends from Australia, and try plenty of beer. The seasonal a like the Konrad stout and the Jean Claude Belgian strong were amazing. I'm a fan of their Saison: it's rich and flavorful and worth coming back for. There are also single casts that have been excellent, but I won't make you jealous because they're gone.

The owners are innovating all the time. They also have events and food trucks that stop by, usually on Saturday night. 

In earnest, it's about time Henderson got its own breweries and this is the type of place I think we deserved."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, really great people, great beers. They tweak their staple beers frequently so you can always find fresh new flavors. Highly recommend and I hope they keep growing."}
{"text":"Very friendly and knowledgeable staff! Located in an industrial area in Henderson with food trucks in the parking lot to feed you. Great place for locals!"}
{"text":"I have been searching Vegas trying to find a brewery with beers that have flavors that pop. Crafthaus is that place! Tasteful beer with great company by staff. Definitely a must for microbrew fans!"}
{"text":"After purchasing Crafthaus beers locally for awhile, my wife and I decided to visit the taproom. It was about 5pm on a Saturday and it wasn't busy so we were able to walk up to the bar and grab a seat. The bartender, I forget his name but had curly ginger hair, wasn't very welcoming. Just gave us menus and didn't engage much. We looked over the menu and ordered some of the special brews on tap. He again didn't say much and almost seemed bothered. We had just came from Lovelady brewery where the staff was extremely friendly, attentative, knowledgeable about their beers, and really showed appreciation that we visited. They even offered a tour after we missed the earlier tour and they were busier. Just in comparison the experience was lackluster and when you visit a taproom you expect the staff to be excited about the beer. This wasn't the case at Crafthaus."}
{"text":"Possible proof of God's existence: Wonderful craft beer that constantly changes, and a food truck outside. Heaven."}
{"text":"This place was great! We are from out of town and we were visiting family for Thanksgiving. We were welcomed right away and found a spot up at the bar area. The guy behind the bar was by himself all night but he sure knew how to handle the crowd. The entire place was full, but everyone was happy and had a beer in their hand. He even told us about all the beers and a little about the brewery. Every bar should have a bartender like this! If we are back in the Vegas area, we will definately be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from Ohio a couple weeks ago and visited a number of microbreweries in town.  I really enjoyed my experience here, as well as Bad Beat around the corner.

Craft Haus is a breath of fresh air in a town with very little options if you don't like dirty, smoky video poker bar experiences.  At Craft Haus, it's all about the beer, which they do a great job at brewing!!

I was there with 3 friends and, as you can see from the pic, we all got their flight sampler.  With eight house beers on tap, it was quite a chore to serve up all of our flights (32 samples total)!!  The bartender was patient and enthusiastic, describing each brew in the flight!  She even poured each of us a glass of water to cleanse the pallet after each sampling.

Personally, the one beer that stood out for me was their Rye IPA!!  This is a new style for me and I was really impressed!!  Their Russian Imperial with coffee was excellent as well!

My friends and I are freaks when it comes to the beer app, Untappd.  The bartender was aware of our checkins on Untappd as we sat at our table and came over a couple of times to give us some insight, and friendly ribbing, concerning our ratings of the beers!  Out of all my visits to dozens of microbreweries, I've never had that happen before! 

Craft Haus has a great atmosphere.  I look forward to coming back whenever I get back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"CraftHaus is a great addition to the neighborhood. Steve gave us a tour of the brewery and was happy to answer all of our questions. The owners are incredibly passionate about their craft. They are currently brewing an IPA, Resinate, and two Saisons: Pomegranate and Evocation. We started with a flight to try them all and loved both the IPA and Saison enough to have one of each. The bar is comfortable and relaxed. The cuckoo clocks and dippy bird brought back fond memories of my grandparents. 

They are celebrating Oktoberfest with specials and German treats. They also started offering Jones soda varieties.

Can't wait to see them grow!"}
{"text":"Another local favortie of mine. Such great beers on tap and inviting staff, how could you pass it up!"}
{"text":"We have since come back and tried this brewery and it was open during the hours of operation. I was reluctant...but I'm really glad we did! Loved it. 

They've put a lot of thought and effort into designing the layout of the bar. You have long tables for groups, and a comfortable bar. They have cuckoo clocks on the wall (matching the logo) and wide open windows to see what is going on in the back. 

Steve was a friendly brewer who clearly has a lot of knowledge about beer and craft breweries. He's got a laid back attitude but still saw to every persons beer needs. He's willing to talk shop and is clearly passionate about what he does, and proud of the product he makes (as they should be).

We grabbed a flight of beers since we hadn't tried their beers prior. I personally loved the Lemon grass. My husband liked the double hopped one. They had 3 of theirs on tap+some guest beers. We will be back because they're going to be releasing new holiday editions like a maple one and a few others.  

Also, great for groups, you can order pizza etc and pair with the breweries beers. (We will do this next time).

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection.  Lots of fun board games.  Loved the music!  We went on a night with a food truck outside, which was awesome!  If the food truck was there every night, this place would be 5 stars.  Thanks for a fun night out!"}
{"text":"I am in regularly and enjoy the atmosphere just as much as the awesome beers.  While the selection is not as extensive as other placed, they are great at what they do.  The staff is very knowledgeable and the bearded guy, Ben, has such a knowledge of beer styles, I have seen him convert a Bud Light only guy to real beer.  You really need to come in and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Nice hidden gem.  We went on a Friday to enjoy a beer my sister and BIL bought us.  The atmosphere was fun and they knew their stuff.  There were a few regulars that were nice to talk to.  It was like a hipster \"Cheers\".  Will definitely go again to try out their other beers."}
{"text":"A brewery gem tucked away in an industrial area of Henderson. Seems quiet outside but wait til you go inside. Hipster cool, local artwork, repurposed glass table... Try it Evocation, the local favorite."}
{"text":"Service was mixed but the beer is real fine. Have had little experience with this brewery but have really enjoyed all beers sampled. 

I'll update this as I become more familiar with each one. 

This is beer worth trying if you've not done so. Supporting the local Brewers is just a plus."}
{"text":"Fell in love with this place from the time I was introduced to them at my first Elite event, pairing up with Donut Bar. 
Although my visits are rare/occasional, my beer cravings are geared towards this local brewery. I'm not kidding when I say that this brand covers every type of beer I want to drink on a regular basis, which can be proved by looking at my shopping cart at every Total Wine visit. Going back to the establishment though...
Doesn't matter who's working there 'cause they're all friendly and social. Everyone knows what they're serving (flavors, types, etc.) and can pretty much detail their seasonal items too. Did I mention their set-up is also cool? I could totally just chill with a flight of IPAs (like yesterday) and just play a board game or two with my fiance. I should also mention (like others have) that they give back to the community by hosting special events, such as Three Square donations before the holidays. 
*SIGH* I really should come here more often. If only I had more friends and family that were into beer."}
{"text":"Spent last night drinking some unique beers. The selection was great. My favorite was the anniversary beer! Atmosphere very relaxed and friendly. Great place to visit with friends and family. Will definitely go back to sample some more of their beers. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This will read much like my last review, because.... Two tasting rooms/ same Booze District area!
Ha, so let's begin with why tasting rooms are superior to bars:

=Beer flights-taste ALL the beers! (Imagine all of the things meme)
=No smoke!! None! You leave as pristine as you entered, minus your crafty new brew scent

What more do you need? 
Ok for flavors here at Crafthaus, I notice we have a smaller handful, but a more playful approach; for example I just had their Resinate IPA \"tweaked with wormwood\" and their sour saison, which was phenomenal. Try it all, try everything, life is about variety.

Food trucks pop in here often, so you may temper your drunken-ness with absorbent stomach contents. The decor in here is really cool and unique; neon stripey things span the ceiling and a big wall length chalkboard that's featuring a local artist, at the moment ;) They also have this theme of cuckoo clocks, which for some reason, I can't seem to get enough of. Also, right now I checked in on  Yelp and got something special, which was a different something special last time I checked in, so don't forget.

They sell growlers( if this is unknown to you, buy one and thank me later-it's a vessel with which to bring home your tasty discovery), as well as shirts with their designs and such. 

While you're here, might as well also check out Bad Beat, less than 1min walk in the same complex. 

Booze District, for the win.

Ooh!! Ask them about \"what happened to the General Dave Grohl pillow\" lol"}
{"text":"The brew masters were pouring the beers . I enjoyed the laid back friendly atmosphere. A place to get a tasty beer minus the slot machines. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is really cool. It reminds me of the 100's of different breweries you can find in San Diego. My favorite is the Jean Claude. It's 7.5% but tastes really light. Also, the board games in there are a nice touch."}
{"text":"Love the NON SMOKING atmosphere! It was fun to play board games too. I liked my beer a lot, my husband not as much, hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"I don't drink beer but met a friend here, very nice people, lots of variety!  Cool place."}
{"text":"Delicious beer. Seriously. The pecan pie Porter (named Pumpkin Beers Can Suck It) is a great take on the pumpkin beers currently flooding the market. The sasion is super refreshing, and the coffee pale ale and stout are equally delicious.
You can get tasting trays ranging from 5 to 8 samples that are 4oz each, so it's easy to try everything. And it's affordably priced, to boot."}
{"text":"This is a fun brewery and tasting room. The beers are fab and there's some unique options. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and totally into beer. It's minimalist, modern, and kinda hipster. There's a variety of seating options. And there's lots of games (non-gambling) to play. It can get crowded on a weekend night here. But it's never so crowded that you can't sit down somewhere. And there's often a food truck parked out front."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Average beer, but I like darker beers. Lots of pale ale and India pale ale choices.  Beers was tasty, but I'd love to taste a deeper palette of flavors. Love the food truck outside and the tabletop foosball."}
{"text":"On our way back from Hoover Dam and Lake Mead, we stopped in for a tasty beer (or cider!). It's a casual environment with plenty of parking, though the venue itself is not street-facing, so you will have to explore the office park a little. I was impressed by the Comrade, which is a Russian Imperial Stout collaboration with Las Vegas Distillery. The Rye IPA and Black IPA were both relatively unique, tasty styles. Cost was $7 for four four-ounce tasters, or $5-8 for a pint."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that I am happy that this place is here because without it, I doubt the craft beer scene in Southern Nevada would be as big as it is and the Booze District in Henderson definitely wouldn't be as big as it is becoming.  That being said, to me, their beers and atmosphere fall flat when compared to those of Bad Beat but that is just a personal preference I guess.  The place is nice and bright and has funny pillows but just isn't that comfortable to me.  CraftHaus is definitely a good place to grab a beer and the owners are some good people and fun to talk to so definitely check this place out.  You'll probably think more of the beer than me anyway."}
{"text":"Great brewery with a constant rotation on tap. Good service, good munchies, good time"}
{"text":"Beer is really good, and I'm not really a beer person. The staff is friendly and knowledgable. I love the atmosphere and location. We came here for our company holiday party, as many of our staff members talked so highly of crafthaus and it didn't disappoint! Thanks so much for an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! You must stop by for a delicious craft beer, delightful conversation and they support other local artisans! CHEERS to our friends at Crafthaus!!!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why I have waited years to review....but. HANDS DOWN the BEST brewery in Las Vegas!! (Henderson!) 

We love this place and frequent 2-3 times monthly. The bartenders are amazing and knowledgeable. There are tons of board and card games to play. They have events all through the year, the chili cook off being one of the best!

If craft beer is your thing, you definitely don't want to miss out on Crafthaus."}
{"text":"I came here Saturday night for the Comrade Day, super excited to finally be trying this place out and was pretty disappointed. We got there about half way through the event and all the souvenir glasses were already gone, the desserts were about gone, food from the food truck were sold out. There's no reason a couple hours into the event everything should be gone. They definitely didn't plan very well. We were all looking forward to having a great night and it didn't quite turn out that way. More upsetting was how we were treated inside at the bar. The guy serving the dessert beers in the back was fantastic. The guy in the front however, I think his name may have been Shane or something like that, was very rude, to the point where we left and didn't even bother to buy anything up there. We bought a couple drinks from the back and left. We had a large party that was actually super excited. It's unfortunate that we had such a bad experience. I know they were super busy because of the event, but that is no reason to be rude to their customers. 

The only beer that I did get a chance to try was the smores one and the beer itself was really good. That's about the only positive thing I can say about this place. Oh, and whoever the nice lady was that gave me her glass because she heard the horrible time I was having there, thank you!"}
{"text":"Out running errands and decided to check out the Henderson Booze District. Not a lot of breweries or distilleries in the state, so, want to support the locals that are here and doing a bang-up job.

Saw a fair amount of cars parked in front and took it as a good sign and decided to make this my first visit.

One of the owners, Wyndee, was tending the bar. Friendly, personable, gave me some tips re: other places to check out for large beer selections. 

Large selection of beers with some interesting combinations of flavors ala some of the special/seasonal Dogfish brews.

Ordered a flight of tasters of the IPAs and pale ale on tap, including one that is made with agave syrup. They were going to tap same beer, but had been aged in a tequila infused barrel and had lime added, but could not stick around for another hour to be there for that. All the beers were very good. Also ordered the sour with watermelon. Normally not a sour guy, and pretty much never a fruit beer drinker, but this was a very nice sour with subtle watermelon flavor, so, enjoyed this as well.

Will be back: need to try other brews and their spent grain pretzel. And also need to visit for their 3rd anniversary party, as they will have 32 beers available along with food trucks and bands."}
{"text":"Was staying in Henderson for work and wanted to try and find local craft breweries just like we have back at home (Pittsburgh, PA). Checked out a couple of them had a beer and left. Got to Crafthaus and didn't want to leave. Such a great atmosphere, chill and relaxed. The beers, all of them were great, some of the best beers I've ever had have down. Bought a growler of the sour beer to take home and share with my fiancé and when I come back will fill it again and again. The bartender was awesome and made the atmosphere what it was.

 Definitely stop by this brewery if you are into craft beers and want the best around.

Also if your into it just like I am, go in on a Thursday night for B Movie Thursday. Have great beers, talk to cool people and watch awful movies you can make fun of while your at it."}
{"text":"First time visiting last night (on a Friday). Wow! What a relief it was to be at a drinking hole where people weren't hunched over their video poker machines. The whole point of a bar is you get to talk to strangers! Cheery place with friendly staff and customers.
Steve the bartender and I think brewer knows a lot about beer and will answer all of your questions. His service was friendly and welcoming. A lot of breweries in my experience can be kinda snooty or cliquey, but this was not so for CraftHaus.
Atmosphere was great. Beer was great. Their selection is limited, but it's changing all the time so you can come back a week later and have a totally different tap selection available. 
No food except for limited snacks, but they do let you get take-out and they bring in food trucks on Saturdays. 
Only wish I had was that the music was a bit more upbeat and the lighting was just a bit dimmer."}
{"text":"Came from Orange County. Glad I did. Well done beers in a great setting. Friendly staff and a triple IPA that might make you forget about Pliny the Younger. Give it a shot and thank me later."}
{"text":"This place is awesome their beer is delicious and full of flavor.  They usually have more that 1 IPA on tap which is always a good reason to go. If you like good beer you should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Customer service is impeccable! All the beer tenders are warm and friendly. The beer selection is outstanding. Establishment has a fun and homey feeling to it. Food trucks that come through are fantastic! Windows to view the back of the house where the beers are created behind bar, super rad. Local beer, you cant go wrong with that. Growlers and squealers radness!"}
{"text":"As a craft beer lover, this place was a fantastic surprise!  I must admit that I haven't been following this brewery much, but after their grand opening that is going to change.  Before I get into the beers though, I must mention that they are right next door to Bad Beat Brewing Co and the Vegas Distillery... why not make an evening of visiting all three!

For the grand opening they had just two beers on tap, but both were great beers.  Their IPA was nicely balanced, slightly malty but also enough bitterness to balance that sweetness and loads of orangey hop flavor.  It's kind of like a really good 2011 IPA (not as dry as today's West Coast IPA's).  This beer is a great addition to the local beer scene.  

They also had a solid saison.  I was a fan of this beer too.  While not funky or over the top with ester flavors, this beer was dry and drinkable at a lower ABV than some of the crazier American saisons.  This is a summer drinker, and it's awesome!

They also had a really fun tasting of their brown ale with cocoa nibs and another version of the same brown ale with coffee.  The idea was to taste both, then blend the two, and then we got to vote on the chalk board which one we liked best.  The winner presumably gets brewed for release (cocoa nibs ftw)!  

I wish I could have gotten to know the owners/brewers of this place, but I am sure in time I will.  They are doing a great job on their first round of beers, and I am truly looking forward to what they have to offer the Vegas beer scene in the future!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times within the past year but my recent visit was last night when Crafhaus was hosting an anniversary party. My parents know Steve and Steph very well and since they had prickly pears growing on their cactus, Steve and Steph made the Prickly Pear IPA out of them! It was featured on the tap list at the party.
One of my favorites I tried on tap was the Berry White IPA. Sadly I only tried one, and I should've had more of that while I was there.
Definitely coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"Their IPA and Saison are great.  They also come up with some tasty tweaked beers and one keg wonders every week.  The owners Dave and Wyndee and brewers Steve and Steph are  nice and happy to talk about their beers.  I really like being able to enjoy a beer without smoke or video poker.  They also have lots of board games."}
{"text":"One of the fun places to drink beer. Staff was friendly, clean and awesome Double IPA
Going back this week."}
{"text":"Steve behind the bar was super nice.  Set me up with a flight of beers.  I'm really exited about coming back often and trying different beers.  Steve said they rotate through a lot of different beers that they make.  Never heard of a brewery that has new beers/variations of beers coming out so often  Especially considering they have not been open very long.  Décor and crowd was a little hipster for me, but everyone was friendly and I felt very welcome and comfortable.  Very nice that they have Jones soda, water and a few other things in a cooler for non-drinkers."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's the cutest little brewhouse in Henderson. It is definitely a secret gem. The beers are great, the staff is friendly, and the bacon jam spread is to die for. If you visit, try their beer sampler. They're all delicious. I can't even begin to describe each one of them - they are all worth a try and I can guarantee you that you would come out of there with a bottle or two or three of the different types of beer.  I honestly don't want to say much more because I kind of want to keep this place a hidden gem."}
{"text":"My husband and I have had this place on our list of date nights for months and finally made our way over there last night. So happy we did. Tried a flight of 5, fell in love with the Evocation Saison, had some great truck food, delightful conversation with Steve, and watched a new  Rubik's record be set. The taproom is comfy and clean, and we thoroughly enjoyed the beers. Looking forward to coming back to taste more of the seasonal brews!"}
{"text":"Beer, and more beer! Board games and food truck fare! Yes, this visit turned out to be a great date night pub crawl. CraftHaus offers a great flight sampler. They sell branded t-shirts, drink ware and growlers. Fun times!"}
{"text":"Great place for craft beers especially since a lot of places to make sour beers or it's not the season. CraftHaus brewery has everything you're looking for. The place has fun board games to entertain yourself or you can sit at the bar and watch TV. 

The crowed is mixed and I'm writing this from a Friday evening. The beers are well priced and cold so if you're in Henderson then come check this place out"}
{"text":"This was a great spot to head to after the Las Vegas Distillery. This is located in the booze district. 

First we got a flight, our favorite was the Resinate IPA! Yum. So of course, we had to order another. While sipping on our drinks, we played battle of the sexes and connect four. We had a lovely time. 

What we love is that we can walk to bad beat brewing and the Las Vegas distillery. We hope that the \"booze district\" will only grow, it's a great hang out joint for henderson folk!"}
{"text":"Great beer and a friendly atmosphere. Ever changing selection of great craft beer. Nice selection of light food, however they usually have a food truck or two outside if you would like a larger selection."}
{"text":"brews were decent, service was pretty lacking - socializing over actual 'customer service'. It's hard to give a pass when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"Craft beer for weirdos. I mean that in the nicest possible way. 

Can there be sub-genres for craft beer? Well if there's not, there should be and Crafthaus would be in the, \"Hopping Mad\" category. These brewers not only push the limits on brewing recipes, but also the idea that craft brewing is an art form and not just a new trend in carbonated inebriation. 

I've come here many a time and had many a beer. This review is a culmination of these now fuzzy memories; beer flights, cask nights, and Dave Grohl. First off, the tap room is awesome, a great mix of bright colors, artistic fixtures, and cuckoo clocks that tell different times from all over the world or something. Half way through your second or third beer these will go off and let you know that time is still a thing, unlike most pubs in Vegas. 

It's hard to pinpoint one favorite beer from this place, because they're always rotating the product like any good craft beer bar should, but lately I've been fond of the Resinate. A sturdy IPA with great flavor and not so much of an after bite. It pushes the palate rather shoving it against the fleshy mouth wall. Great choice for the first time IPA tester. It's mellow unlike some other breweries who like their IPA to have that punch. This tasty beast is served all year round. 

The Comrade is a new addition that I found out will only be around for a short time. This is dark \"robusty\" beer has a high alcohol rate... chuggers beware! With things like  Munich, Crystal, Wheat, Chocolate, Flaked Oats, how can it not be good! BTW, What the hell is Crystal? 

There was another beer I was going to mention that was made with wormwood. Honestly, I've never had anything like it before and I've forgotten it's name. It's hard to explain in words, so I'll just say... purple, monkey, dishwasher. Weirdest shit ever. 

I've also had the pleasure of meeting the owners, Wyndee and Dave, who not only have a solid place to sip suds, but also play some of the best bar tunes I've heard in a while... you effing hipsters. Kidding!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin for my favorite breweries in Vegas??! Always amazing quality beer... And the tweaks want me to come back every week!! Let's be honest I do anyways! Brewers Steve and Steph are super knowledgable and Wyndee and Dave, the owners, are amazing and friendly!!"}
{"text":"Love the idea of their \"tweaked\" series! I hope they can keep it up. This is why people keep coming back. Always something new to try.
Great atmosphere and the brewers, Steve and Steph are usually on hand for a chat. Very personal touch here.
Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"One of the est microbreweries in Vegas. Great atmosphere. Only drawback is the lack of food during the week. Weekends normally have food trucks around"}
{"text":"Coming in here on Thursdays is one of my weekly highlights. I don't even play trivia, but Thursday is the day I can get a ride home. The Jean Claude is one of my favorite beers of Vegas, with the evocation on nectarines a close second. I loved banger, but crafthaus stole my heart. If I could find a house next door I would in a heartbeat and would direct deposit my paychecks into their register and go from there. I also discovered they fill corny kegs, so I'll be able to obsess over their beer at home."}
{"text":"If it's your first time going... You'll probably get lost and confused. I promise you, this place is worth the confusion. I loved my experience here and cannot wait to go back! A friend and I decided to try on a Friday after work. Like I said I got lost, but once I found it and walked in I knew this was my scene. The decor is super cool and mellow. The staff is awesome, friendly, and funny. 

I loved sitting at the bar and being able to look through a window into the brewery behind us. Just a super cool touch on their behalf. I started out with the beer sampler just to get a taste of what their home brews had to offer. I found it hilarious that we got a \"flight attendant\" which was a little bird that rocked back and forth into a glass of water. Definitely a cute and funny detail. I liked most of the beers but settled on the Jean Claude-a strong Belgian beer. 

We got some hot German pretzels to satisfy our rumbly tummies and just hung out enjoying our beers. This place definitely attracts a cool crowd and I loved everyone that walked in. Chatted with a bunch of other patrons and everyone was as friendly and cool as the next. Definitely a smaller place, but remember... Size doesn't matter! I can't wait to go back and enjoy another beer. 

This place definitely pays attention to details and is all about making your experience as fun and enjoyable as possible. 

Warning: this is a brewery and there is no full kitchen. They do sell snacks, but if you're looking for a place to get a beer and full dinner you might wanna hold off on trying this place."}
{"text":"In a tie for best brewery in Las Vegas area right now for me, along with their neighbors Bad Beat.
About 100 yards away from Bad Beat Brewing in same industrial park, so great to hit them back to back. Food from LV Food Junky truck close by and they'll walk your food over to deliver to you at the taproom.
Smaller, more focused, taplist compared to Bad Beat. Had everything, and Evocation, Evocation tweaked with Meridien hops, and Sea Cucumber stood out. Resinate IPA was average, at best. Much better West Coast IPAs than that. Sea Cucumber- think slight sourness, cucumber and salt, and you have the taste profile down. Evocation is a good example of an American Saison. Belgard stout with coffee was like a 3.5 star beer.
Worth a visit, nice views of the brewery, nice bartenders, plenty of games to play and sports on TV. Seahawks bar on NFL game days too."}
{"text":"Loved this brewpub! Located within an industrial complex. Easy parking. Many board games to choose from inside, should you need something besides beer and conversation to occupy your time. Food options are limited because they outsource- they are a brewpub, not a restaurant. I tried the Dubbel and it was delicious! We sat at the bar and enjoyed conversation with another friendly patron."}
{"text":"Awesome place run by super nice people. I'm just sad they were open a whole year before i ever went there."}
{"text":"Had this brewery bookmarked for awhile.  Several of the peeps at work have raved about this place and after today, I am in total agreement.

Craft House Brewery is tucked away in an industrial complex of Gibson and Warm Springs, but is very easy to find, and has plenty of parking.

Upon entry the place is cozy, has plenty of seating and super clean.  The ambiance is modern, but makes you feel at home. You can see into the brewery from the seating area which was super cool as they were messing with some cotton candy mixture that I'm sure will be amazing. Also, if your in the mood they have a plethora of board games to pass the time while enjoying your tasty brews.

We made our way to the bar and was greeted by Wyndee (yep I had done some research and knew who was attending the bar).  She was doing a wonderful job attending to the full bar while still smiling and doing her thing.  Great job.

I went with a with the Resonate  IPA, and Evocation Saison with an add of citrus. Both were amazing and full of flavor. Wyndee did the perfect pour. Definitely some of the best beer I have had in a long time.  

I am huge fan of locals and small business,  and Craft House Brewery is a staple of that.  Although this was my first trip, I have always wanted to find a place that feels like home and this is it.  Amazing staff and atmosphere.  Great job and I will be back more times than I will be able to count.  See you next time around Craft House."}
{"text":"Located in the booze district in Henderson, Crafthaus is a nice little venue for a drink.  The place is pretty small and you wouldn't even know it was there if you weren't looking for it.  The brewery from the outside looks more like a warehouse, but the inside has a nice bar vibe to it;  ample room to talk and drink.

They serve a rotating tap of their in house beer and also do flights.  The prices are very reasonable, especially because the quality is top notch.  I believe they specialize in Belgian styles, but also make a nice IPA.  Their Evocation Saison is a great rendition of the style.  I believe they serve some appetizers/small food but I am not positive.  

This would be my go to bar if I lived in the area.  The beer changes constantly, the prices are fair, and the owner is great.  They even have trivia on Mondays.  Try out Crafthaus if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This is what every neighborhood brewery should be. The beers were all excellent and the atmosphere is fresh without being too hipster. You'll always feel like talking to everyone at the bar and Steve is an excellent host. The beer prices are super affordable, and i do love the 12 once option for light weights like myself. There are currently five taps with more to come. I highly recommend this place, especially for beer lovers in Henderson! I hope that food will be an all the time option in the future as i have heard of Baguette sandwiches making their way over here."}
{"text":"In a city with so much commercialization, it's so nice to have a place like the CraftHaus Brewery where you can enjoy a freshly made beer with funky, like-minded individuals.  They have a really nice, cozy atmosphere.  Great beer!!

You can combine the visit with the Bad Beat Brewery, too, although the two are not affiliated.  They are located in the same industrial park."}
{"text":"Coming from Minnesota, I can appreciate a good brew pub. Cool decor, great beers, friendly service, even the other patrons are entertaining and engaging. I highly recommend anyone who appreciates a delicious craft beer stop by. 
Located in the Booze District, you could spend an entire day entertaining your taste buds with everything from whiskey to wine. 
But please, Crafthaus, if you're reading this, please start tapping Comrade for growlers. Or cans. I'm not picky. You know what, I'm totally fine with a personal keg of the coffee Comrade."}
{"text":"Probably the best atmosphere you will find for Craft beer this size in the Vegas area.  Good selection and some excellent food trucks here.  The staff is great.  Give this a try, as craft beer in Nevada is rare due to some weird state laws developed by casino driven politics from way back.  No smoking, no gambling, a piece of the west moving to Nevada.  They have these cool events like booze yoga, and Firkin Friday where they tap a new beer.  They like to infuse or \"tweak\" as they put it' with flavorful accents."}
{"text":"The owner is very nice, however  the beer is not that great.  It was very blah.  They only had two of their own beers on tap and the rest where guest beers.  I was not impressed with their beer ...seemed a little watered down."}
{"text":"We absolutely love it here! Awesome beers, great staff/owners...and amazing service. Love the local brewery feel and love seeing them grow!! Cheers!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I first visited this brewery about a year ago and we have been hooked ever since. This really is your local Cheers mixed with a Starbucks. 

The staff and patrons are very friendly and FUN! If you sit at the bar, you can always find someone to strike up conversation with (usually surrounding our love for craft beers). The owners/brewers are fun-loving, chill masters of the Craft and are almost always around to chat.
If you come around often enough and talk to people - everybody really does know your name!

The brews are mostly Belgian style (my favorite) and are delicious. The head brewers Steph and Steve are constantly experimenting with tweaked versions of their classics, which turn out to be a tasty way to mix things up. (Steph/Steve - When you read this - please bring back the saison tweaked with Rhubarb and the Glitter Bomb anniversary beer!!!). On weekends they have food trucks in the parking lot and they're usually tasty too!

The Taproom is clean and cozy. Instead of the atmosphere you'd expect at a loud, smokey bar, you get a clean, inviting space more akin to a Starbucks. They have board and card games, or you can bring your own game and hang out with friends. They also have special events such as Booze Yoga, B-Rated Movie Night, Football specials, etc. 

Overall, it's just a fun, friendly hang with great craft beer! Never have I had a bar or brewery feel more like home. This is our Haus! ;)"}
{"text":"I came here for a private event and I'm glad I did. I never knew there was a brewery back in this area of henderson and it is a hidden gem. I'm not a big beer enthusiast but on occasion I will have a few drafts. I had a selection that was similar to a heffaweisen but I'm not %100 sure of the name. The good thing is the friendly staff helps you choose something you may be interested in based of of your favorite beers. I was not too adventurous but definitely satisfied with the beer I had. I will defiantly be back here sample some more of what they have on tap."}
{"text":"My honey took me to as many of the local breweries I could handle while visiting Las Vegas. In the end there are no 5 star breweries in Vegas, but CraftHaus is as close as you'll get to greatness here.

Not sure what it was about this place, yet when I walked in, I immediately felt welcomed. Perhaps it was the brightly colored, brightly lit atmosphere. This is no dank 'n dark bar scene. It looks more funky coffee house than tap room.

Cool touches from the Bill Murray pillow on the couch, the huge windows behind the bar that give you a view of what's going on in the brewery area, to using what looks like a utensil drain rack to hold the samplers, shows that they thought an awful lot about the details of the brew paradise. 

The impromptu mini brewery tour, led by brewmaster Steve was one of a kind. In fact, we were about to leave after I finished the sampler when we heard folks gathering for a beer tour. Even though the brewery consists of one large room, with only a few tanks, it's as informative as you'll find. In fact, with all his Aussie wit, Steve was the perfect host of a beer tour. 

Being a small brewery, the selection is limited for now. They had only three available on our visit. They do have guest beers on tap to round out a full sampler. The few house beers they had on tap were all high quality. Even though I'm not a saison fan, the saison was actually quite memorable. 

After trying it in the sampler, I had to order a tall pint of the their IPA. As a young Isaiah Thomas wannabe, I often heard this saying that could equally be applied to this beer, \"nice hops!\". Very nice indeed. The combination of Chinook, Centennial, and Cascade hops isn't anything new, yet Steve and company managed to nail it here.

Hopefully when we return in another year or so, CraftHaus will be have managed to expand their offerings while still maintaining their high level of character."}
{"text":"Good overall feel to this place. Solid IPA and very good DIPA."}
{"text":"all the way from FL says open until 10pm dark as hell we had party of 6 and had a few beers at bad beat then headed over at 940pm and locked up like a prison. very disapoointed"}
{"text":"Great spot, always prompt and super friendly service! Bright and clean taproom, fantastic beer and they host awesome events to stay involved in the community. This brewery represents the whole point of the craft beer scene!"}
{"text":"Looked these guys up online and thought I will try them out on my way into Vegas, rolled in about an 1 1/2 hours before closing on a Sunday.

Nice tap room atmosphere and Nick who was serving was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about beer.

Definitely will be back,

I tried 7 tasters and 6 were really really good. Some of my favorites were the Black IPA, Comrade Russian imperial stout and the Resinate IPA."}
{"text":"A great little tap room in the Henderson Booze District. Always fun people in tap room! Quality beers and fair prices. A great place to just hang out and enjoy some really nice, mostly hop forward Belgian-style beers."}
{"text":"great beer fun place. the owner was awesome and came in early to give our group a private tour."}
{"text":"CraftHaus is a microbrewery Vegas can be proud of. The focus is on a smaller selection of only four or so brews. A couple stay year round while the other offerings are seasonal. Their Evocation is a light and refreshing Saison, specifically tailored for the hot and long summer months. Their Tweaked series is a cool concept, adding different ingredients, aromas, and flavor profiles to a current beer. 

The brewery itself is small, but the tasting room has a hipster, artsy feel. A flight of beers (four 4 oz.) + a brewery tour = $10. Head brewer Steve was informative and quite knowledgable. 

Check-in for a free spiffy bottle cap magnet!"}
{"text":"Have to love this place. Great beer and good vibes. Stopped in most recently for the Comrade Day this past weekend. Love that they have all of the board games to play while sipping on delicious beers. Also like the pallet furniture. Good spot to spend a weekend afternoon relaxing with friends."}
{"text":"I love craft beer, and I'm so excited that a little crafty community is finally growing in our beer desert. The setup at CraftHaus is cool, the shop is actually comfortable, and they'll sell you some snack foods (or press out a pre-made Panini for you). 
When I went, they pretty much only had 3 beers (IPA, Saison, and stout - or porter - can't remember). Then they had some options on those like peach-tweaked saison, rose-tweaked saison, etc. I liked the plain saison and the IPA was ok (typically not an IPA fan). Prices are really reasonable, and it's close to my house. Here's hoping CraftHaus and craft beer in general keep growing."}
{"text":"Soooooo happy to find this place so close to home!  Beer is an amazing variety of tasty! They have pub quiz too!  Funky, eclectic local spot.  I've met so many interesting people here!"}
{"text":"The booze district, proving again that looks are deceiving. You want to go to CraftHaus. You just have to find it first.

We passed by this a number of times trying to find it. Walking in, it's not a huge space. There also seems to be a lot of empty space when you walk in. They've only been open about a year, so I'm sure it is in the works to improve the space. 

I had Resinate IPA on draft. I've had it in a can and it was good but nothing like on draft. This was the bee's knees. Huge fan of IPAs and this delivered. We also tried the Fall Maple Spice beer. This beer was truly a fall beer as it had all the spices you would associate with Fall. A few sips were fine with me, but I can't imagine having a whole pint of that.

The best part about CraftHaus was the variety of games they had at their disposal. We easily spent an hour just messing around with their selection. I beat my Fiancee at Connect Four (where? DIAGONALLY!) We also played Smart Ass (doesn't really work with 2 players but it was fun) and then we just tried answering questions from the 20th anniversary of Trivial Pursuit. Oh yes, that was a blast from the past. My trivia knowledge of things that happened before 2002 is not very good mind you.

We had a blast just sitting and messing around with board games. The beers on draft are very good as well. I will say, it didn't have as friendly as an atmosphere as Bad Beat Brewing and there's a lot of empty space like I said earlier. Only small TVs in the joint, so if a game is on and you really want to see it, this wouldn't be the place to go to. 

Still, disconnect for a while and sit down with some friends for good brews and board games. It's worth it."}
{"text":"This is a long overdue visit stemming from various beer samplings and from last year's awesome Yelp Elite event. Don't wait for the new year to fulfill resolutions, right?

CraftHaus Brewery is a local Henderson business in what might be mistaken for an office complex if you're not looking closely. I'd read that they're a pioneer of the budding beer business in Henderson and enjoyed them as a Yelp event. I've recently started diving headlong into exploring craft beers and I was attracted by a slightly ambiguous New Year's Eve promo, so I made it a point to stop here on the last day of this year.

I started with a sampler flight ($7 for four 4-oz pours) of some of the beers which were available for purchase as 6-pack cans (7 of their 12 drafts; also available were 2 can-only beers). Unfortunately, I wasn't enamored with any of them. The Resinate (an IPA) and Neon Empire (a \"red IPA\") were a little more interesting in flavor than the others. The Belgard (a coffee stout) was also quite drinkable but lacked complexity. The Mojave (a \"southwest\" IPA) was the most bland. I rated them all somewhere between a 3 and a 4 (out of 5) on a certain beer-centric app.

I didn't end up taking advantage of either of the New Year's Eve promotions, which were a case (20% off for four 6-packs) and growler fills  (buy one, get one 50% off), so I didn't end up getting that a free pint of beer. The promo was a bit misleading, but I won't dock them for it because it was a fairly enjoyable time in a not-so-loud atmosphere (silence mostly interrupted by the cheers of Seahawks fans, i.e. the bartender and at least one patron, on Sunday afternoon). I just wish that they'd had other flavors available. Evocation (a saison) is a favorite from samplings but wasn't available as cans, and Comrade (a \"Russian\" imperial stout) wasn't anywhere to be seen.

I'll be back to CraftHaus from time to time, if not to taste some draft-only beers which I abstained from today, then as various beer releases and promos are announced throughout next year. The pricing (including $5-7 pints) is great and the proximity to me is a cool bonus, and I'm optimistic that I'll fall in love with one of their other flavors."}
{"text":"Their IPA is the just the best. But they could be bolder in what they brew. The atmosphere is fresh and welcoming. The bartenders are always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Adorable place. It could use a little more bar food but very cute and very welcoming environment."}
{"text":"CraftHaus Brewery isn't a bad little place to come and try some good local craft beers. There are windows looking to the back at the actual brewing operations. The owners are on hand to serve you and even just talk to you. They have a lot of seating between the bar stools, couches and picnic tables so if it is crowded like it was last night you still may find a place to sit. You could choose to sit with another group in there and make some new friends. Perhaps even pull up one of the many games and have a little fun while you drink. 

Speaking of drinking, the beers here are a unique collection of what beer can be. Last night they had 12 beers on tap. If you don't know which to choose or if you like all kinds of beer, try a flight. They have flights starting at $7 for 4 samples. And you choose which you want. I tried their Shiny New Toy, Table Beer, something with raspberry and a coffee stout. The stout was my favorite of the night. It was like drinking an iced coffee. I could have done a pint of that easily. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Was greeted with a warm welcome by Wendy walking in and did samples of each beer on tap.  Beautifully crafted beer from the Russian Imperial Stout to the Blackstar.  Highly recommend to anyone visiting LV and wanting to check out the local scene.  Warm friendly and knowledgable service with Outstanding Product.

A Hidden Gem in the Vegas scene."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about CraftHaus Brewery. The staff is incredibly knowledgeable not only about their own beer, but about the craft beer world as a whole. The owners and staff are committed to both the craft, and the community. They keep things exciting by doing fun weekly events, releases, and tappings. They have done such a good job creating a fun environment to enjoy great beer in. 

I highly recommend their double IPA called Giggle juice, as well as their Superbloom IPA. The centerpiece is by far my favorite sour, and It's always a treat when they add a fruit flavor to it! 

The location can be tricky to find if you are typing it in on your iPhone. Don't give up, I promise it's worth finding. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was a little perplexed when my google maps steered me into this area. I'm like what am I doing in an industrial park on a Saturday night?

Semi-trucks and feeling like you are almost in Arizona aside, this place is pretty cool. I tried out their maple spice beer. A lot is going with it and I like it. Next time I will get a little tasting platter but I just felt like being a beer monogamist at the time. 

The staff were really welcoming. Someone had left their bicycle outside and they approached the guy and encouraged him to bring it inside the bar to keep an eye on it. I think that is a super sweet touch. There are also plenty of games to choose from if you wanted to play some games while imbibing. They also have a few tvs playing sports. 

I definitely want to try this place out again and delve deeper into their brews. Also, if you get hungry, those semi-trucks magically get replaced by food trucks as the night goes on."}
{"text":"We love this place. It feels great to enjoy a delicious beer and support a local business. My man friend and I come here pretty regularly and are always really pleased with the friendliness of the bartenders and the other patrons. We'll come here and have a tasting or just a beer or two. There's a bunch of board games to be played with, too."}
{"text":"Brewery located in the industrial area of Henderson. The brewery is located in a warehouse park.

The tasting room has a full bar, plenty of seating, and board games.

All of the brewery's selections are on tap and some are in a can. You can also do beer flights in any number.

The bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable about the brews."}
{"text":"They have about 14 on site brews, ranging from Belgium, wheat and IPA mixtures. Bar and table seats available to drink, eat and play board games. They have a big restroom. Big windows show the operations of this active brewery.

They have some bar munchies and on Fridays a food truck. The pasty is the size of a man's hand with a heavenly crust surrounding your choice of ingredient.

Easy parking. Relaxed atmosphere. No loud crazies here, or at least when we visited this Friday afternoon. Another brewery and distillery located walking distance."}
{"text":"I got a cold, reheated quiche and a really unbalanced beer. Prices seemed fair, but staff made me feel unwelcome. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I had the chance to visit again recently and I wish I could rate this place at more than a five. 

We had a couple of samplers so that we could try all of the beers. I loved all of the beers they were offering. Fall Maple Spice and the beer with Hibiscus were really good. The Oatmeal Stout is tasty as well. There wasn't a beer there that I didn't like. Pricing is very reasonable as well.

It looked like they have added more seating since my last visit as well. On a Saturday evening we were easily able to get a table for a group and hang out playing games for the evening.

The guy behind the bar was awesome. It was only later in the evening that I realized he was on his own because he was holding it down! He was incredibly friendly and welcoming as well. Someone in our group party fouled and spilled a beer, but the guy at the brewery was really cool about it. He was much cooler than I would have been. 

Love this spot!"}
{"text":"Great beer, nice people and fun atmosphere! My husband and I really enjoy going there and enjoying a beer. Really hope to see this place succeed and for the booze district to expand with more breweries!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Always friendly always good beer!!! This is the best beer establishment in Nevada. They are a local brewery with an awesome brewing team and incredible owners. They are always friendly and helpful in the beer selection. They are also very help to a home brewer like myself. They are willing to answer any question. They are living the dream and thriving in all aspects of it."}
{"text":"Great modern environment, the server was very nice and talkative. 

They only had 3 beers on tap when I went in so I wasn't able to try very much, but the sasion was very nice and the IPA nice as well, very tary and smooth. 

Pints were $4-6. No food. No smoking which is nice. 

Bad Beat Brewing is in the same parking lot and worth checking out as well."}
{"text":"Different type of bar but a good different. Tucked away behind all the businesses but close to home and nice place! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Best local beer in town. Absolutely love their IPA! The Saison is good as well as all their specialties. All u can say us get there and get a beer, you will love it."}
{"text":"It's my first time here at crafthaus. Came here with my girlfriend. The atmosphere was really awesome. It was quaint, and had accessible table games for us to enjoy for however long we wanted. Our server, Ben, was really friendly and helpful with our first experience, would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I believe an update and rating bump are in order. As they approach their one-year anniversary, Crafthaus has easily become my favorite local brewery. It's a combination of the solid beer and friendly atmosphere that keeps me coming back despite living 20 miles away.

It also helps that they almost always have something new on tap. At first I thought the \"tweaked\" series was a bit gimmicky, but they've been coming out with some gems lately. I recently enjoyed their Belgard Belgian Stout, which they've also tweaked with Makers & Finders cold brew coffee and then with toasted coconut. I enjoyed it all three ways but especially loved the coconut iteration.

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention their short-lived Sour Peach. Finally. A great local sour. More of that please!"}
{"text":"Another stop on our  cross country beer adventure.. This place has a top notch vibe to it with a clean, fresh design aesthetic. Bonus points for a \"pay it forward\" board and a \"share the bottle\" night for bringing in your own special favorite for others to try.

The beer was good, but stayed within the confines of what would be expected. Interestingly, we dug the Saison with citrus. Not a big Saison guy, but this was a real nice, bright, smooth offering. 

In all fairness, I didn't have the whole line up, and we'll be back tonight to finish up.

My feeling is this place is on the cusp of being a leader in the Sin City basin."}
{"text":"So I may give the beer a slightly higher rating, but when the regular patrons are talking about \"homos\" (obviously in a derogatory manner) there is no way you deserve any stars regardless of your beer. I say this not to hold the establishment responsible for the customer's comments, but rather expecting the bartender with whom the conversation is happening to politely inform the customer that the comments are inappropriate in a welcoming to all establishment, that the customer should be respectful and to kindly keep inappropriate comments to himself while enjoying his beer at the bar.  I was sitting across the room and heard the customer-bartender discussion as well as the patron's continuing discussion about other \"homos\" with another regular customer at the bar.  It is all about the environment (other customers and the tap room workers) and feeling welcome and safe while enjoying a nice beer.

The bartender otherwise was a nice, friendly guy and provided very good service."}
{"text":"For starters, the place is really nice! You're welcomed by bright colors and a well-lit space. I love the variety of furniture and how open everything feels. I love the wall of colorful cuckoo clocks! The brewing room is separate, however, you can also hang out in there as well (also known as the Pallet Lounge). The brewery is also located in the Booze District, so it's conveniently situated next to other liquor establishments like fellow craft brewers, Bad Beat.

We visited on the second night of their Grand Opening Extravaganza and they had two beers available: Resinate (IPA) and Evocation (Saison). They were also offering samples of Tantalus (Hazelnut Brown Ale). Resinate is much lighter than other IPAs I've tried and Ruben really enjoyed it. Evocation is more my type of beer since it has a lighter flavor and I liked the fruity notes.

It's a great hangout, so if you like beer, you must stop by. Fantastic addition to Las Vegas' craft brews."}
{"text":"I asked the bearded fellow for a beer, using my words I was immediately provided with excellent service. I am so amazed by the profound attention to service and friendliness that was provided after the simple use of communicative expression. Seriously, that one guy, at a brewery, with a beard was so helpful and friendly, I will return regularly."}
{"text":"I love crafthaus; I backed them when they were a kickstarter project, and boy did they ever deliver. 

Their beers are amazing riffs on the classics, all imminently drinkable. I am deeply in love with the various tweaks of their Saison, right now. 

The bar is just a wonderful place to hang out that is utterly un-vegas in every way. It's like an embassy of bar culture from Portland or Minneapolis. Relax, play a board game, and enjoy some delicious beers in a low key, welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Found a great little taproom here with an amazing strong ale and saison! Ben was super cool and very helpful since I'd never been there.  Decor is nicely done as well. Nice brews....Rock on!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite haunts! Located in the industrial park around Warm Springs And American Pacific. Parking is easy and the spot it great. Now to the beer...I'm a beer snob and Crafthaus does a rally nice job for a younger local beer company. I'm from San Diego so I set the bar high...Stone, Green Flash, Ale Smith, etc. 

Great prices for flights, pints and growlers. The bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly. They do some great collaboration beers too. The Jean-Claude is an amazing Belgium/Abby style beer. So good! Only beef is they don't have it year round . Heir coffee stout is solid as is their strong IPA. Not a big Sour fan but their Table Sour Beer is nice too. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Crafthaus Brewery located in the booze district is a great place to unwind and let loose.  Upon walking in you'll notice the spacious open seating and a large bar with a view into the taproom.  The friendly staff ready to find you the perfect beer, with the various choices on their menu a sample would be wise. 

The brewmasters (Steve and Steph) and owners (Dave and Wyndee) are fantastic at developing flavorful beers that are full of flavor, passion, boldness and as unique as they're to your glass.  A few of my favorites are the Comrade, Jean Claude, and Belgard. 


Comrade (2017) *   Stout - Imperial / Double *   10.2% ABV *   55 IBU
Full bodied and definitely a sipping beer to enjoy each moment with this seasonal.

 Jean Claude ·  Belgian Strong Golden Ale *   8.7% ABV *   26 IBU
Sneaky smooth will sneak up and knock you out if you're not watching.

Belgard *   Coffee Stout *   5.2% ABV *   30 IBU
Cold brewed coffee deliciousness in every sip.

Events are held regularly here and their, Comrade Day and Jean Claude release parties are epic and draw large groups of beer enthusiasts from all over. 

 No matter your preference of beer there is something on tap ready for consumption. Will definitely be back supporting this local brewery and business!  Cheers"}
{"text":"Came across this place threw an email from Yelp! Its somewhat hard to find. I love the inside. They have it set up very well with lots of seating. They have a ton of games too! The bartender was great! Friendly and attentive. The beers on the other hand were not my favorite. My husband and friend felt the same way (so i had to take a star away for that reason). We ordered a sampler of all the beers, and the only one all of us enjoyed was the Coffee Stout (very good). I would come back for that beer only. I do recommend trying this place. Cool inside, great service and a local spot. I buy the cans of the coffee stout when I see them in the stores now. Its very good!"}
{"text":"The outspoken bar tender with the beard makes this place a joy to visit even if your not a big beer drinker...come and try an interesting variety of beers, enjoy the atmosphere, meet new people and make some new beer drinking connoisseurs!"}
{"text":"Amazing beer, great snacks and fun games. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and allowed me to bring my own pizza in! Thank you."}
{"text":"This place is like a diamond in the rough. It's a little bit difficult to find, you would have to know about it to find it, but once you do it's pretty cool. We came here for a friends going away party and the bartender was so sweet and accommodating with us. He deffinately did a great job on recommending beers and offering suggestions. I'm not really a beer drinker but the bartender (Ben I think) suggested my first beer which was the saison hibiscus and was delicious, I could taste the floral aromas and was light enough for my liking. The second beer he suggested was the firkin which was the centerpiece with blueberry tea which was also delicious and relaxing to enjoy. I love the craft and passion that stand behind the crafthause brewery."}
{"text":"Great if you like IPAs but not one lager on the menu. Nice atmosphere and great staff but the variety was lacking for me."}
{"text":"This place has a cool vibe. I think they will grow well and produce great beer. Nice place to hang out and have good conversation."}
{"text":"CraftHaus is an excellent place to visit when exploring breweries.  The decoration is wonderful!  There is plenty of room and pretty little succulents (can you tell they're my fav?) on the wooden tables.  The bartender was so welcoming and warm.  They had an excellent variety of snacks to choose from, including a cheese and meat tray.  They have a little \"flight attendant\" for when you order flights (see pics).  He is a little bird served with a glass of water that sits with you while you drink and dips his nose into the water.  I just thought that was different and a cute touch."}
{"text":"Mojave IPA and Giggle Juice are yummy. Great conversation with the dudes who work here and a couple patrons.  Come to the source. Chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Super cool local brewery. Really chill and calm which is how I like it. They've got board games to keep you distracted while drinking. Plenty of parking which can be a big problem for places here in Vegas. More sours than most breweries so if you like those types of beers this is your place. Also a good choice of ipas. And the owners are very nice. Check this place out and support local!"}
{"text":"Awesome place look for the guy with the beard great service great beers.  Sours iPas everything you want from a microbrew.  Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I had no clue it was even here except for the ad I just saw on yelp for their anniversary Glitter Bomb party! What a great time! They had bands, food and about 19 beers to either sample or have a whole glass. What more can a woman ask for???

My goal was to sample all of the beer. Came close but no cigar. I won't get in detail but there were some definite highlights. First let's start with the Glitter Bomb. Now it was advertised as a sour table beer and that it was. I like to think of it more like a palate cleanser. But more notable is that it was glittery for sure. My friend even made the comment that it looked like shampoo because of it's iridescence. Also loved the Belgian Quadrupel and the Belgard tweaked with coffee.

As far as food... They had a taco truck (food looked amazing but the line was too long for my patience) and a Rick Moonen table that had amazing chicken pot pie bites and tater tots with tartar sauce. Yummers! Would I like to have seen more food? Of course! But this was a beer celebration and not a food festival so get over it already! 

Now that I know this is here, I am super stoked to go back and learn more about their beer when it isn't so busy. Also learned there is another brewery and a distillery nearby as well. So happy our amazing city is broadening it's horizons!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our first time at the craft haus brewery!

After looking for local breweries in Henderson and Las Vegas, hubby and I decided to try craft haus  on a random evening. The bartender, Ben was very welcoming and suggested that we try the sampler so that we got a chance to try all of the brews on tap. We were able to go through everything on draft and pick our favorites after.

 They were fun board games and trivia games to enjoy the atmosphere as well as art see chalk drawing on the walls and a Dave Grohl Pillow to boot. The music & the vibe was very soothing and relaxing and a very fun place to hang out and try new beers at.

Ben was very nice and suggested some awesome craft beers for us and this is definitely a place will come back to you to enjoy the ambience and see what else they have that's in season on draft!"}
{"text":"Love this little gem...the whole team make it worth while to be there. They could be selling paper towels and id still go amd hang out. Well done guys!"}
{"text":"I remember when Crafthaus first poured at a beer festival in Sunset Park a few years ago.  Since they opened the brewery, I have stopped in many times for a  cold one and they never disappoint. Great service by the whole staff and Wyndee is a very personable owner.  Great choice of beers including their tweaked series...I had Evocation tweaked with Chilean Wine Must from Grape Expectations yesterday and it was on point for a hot summer day. A must stop/visit on your local craft brewery tour."}
{"text":"This place is great! The bartender was so friendly and served me an amazing IPA. It's a great place to meet new people! Very safe and fun atmosphere! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Small and inviting.  It is not a full food service gastro pub, just the key ingredients - great beers.  The staff is great and willing to spend the time discussing their brews, philosophy, and the meaning of life.
Bring your friends and make yourselves comfortable and enjoy this part of life. Or just come make new friends."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's been 3 months since they opened and almost 2 months since my initial review. Boy, time flies when you are drinking great beer! :)

As I mentioned before, this is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. The tap room is quite different from Bad Beat (they are walking distance to each other). I love the decor and the light, airy feel of the place.

Where they really shine is with their staff.  Everyone is really friendly, helpful and nice and you can tell how passionate they are about beer. 

I love hearing that they are going to start featuring art work from local artists. They have a large chalk board that was recently designed in a huge mural in chalk. Apparently they didn't want to erase it (it's beautiful) and will be re-mounting it in the brewery and changing it every few months.

My original criticism was that they didn't have enough of their own beers on tap.  That is still the case, but things have gotten better. I really liked the Fall Maple Spice and the Coconut Porter, and they regularly tap \"tweaked\" versions of their beers (currently on tap - Evocation Saison tweaked with Elderberries). On Fridays (not sure if it's every Friday) they have \"Firkin Fridays.\" This week they will feature a Coconut version of their Resonate IPA. The firkins don't last long, so if you want one of these beers - get there when they are tapped (6pm)!

I hate the stupid law here that tap rooms can only be 20% of the size of your brewery, because I think that eventually they will outgrow this restriction (soon).

I am SO happy to see Vegas finally moving in the right direction when it comes to beer. It's refreshing to go to a place that is smoke free and you can actually socialize because everyone is not glued to the TV or their video poker machines.

Seriously, if you are in the area (or even not), you should take a trip to the Booze District and visit CraftHaus!"}
{"text":"Great Beer.   The brewers educated professionally in Australia (their country of origin).  They drove around country in a van visiting possible breweries for which they would like to work before settling here in The Booze District of Henderson. Variety of styles and quality of beer is awesome.  They had a triple IPA which tasted so smooth and not warm at all but was WICKED!      Never thought have I thought that a 13% ABV beer would be so exquisite.   Try coming here and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Alright, this place is a legit brewery in the Eastgate industrial complex of a somewhat desolate stretch of road in Henderson.  They have a solid beer selection, friendly staff and the patrons of this outfit are equally cool as well.  There is plenty of space to sit and hang out and the overall environment is extremely comfortable.

I showed up on a Monday night in which I lucked out on a few different factors. 1.) It wasn't noisy or crowded.  2.) I ran into several fellow San Diegans.  3.) It was bottle share night!  Winning!

Anyway, I went with a flight, sampling each beer which when combined with the bottle sharing, was more than enough.  The standouts for me were the Resinate IPA, Evocation Saison, Centerpiece Sour, Fall Maple Spice (Definitely a flavorful seasonal beer), and the Any Which Way Rye IPA.  Now that I think about it, that's a pretty solid majority of their beers that I actually liked.  I suppose that's a good thing. Yep, definitely a good thing.  I easily spent a lot more time here than I initially planned.

Additionally, the guy working the bar new his stuff and was an all around great and friendly person, thus making this place an ideal go-to place for a comfortable craft beer drinking experience. So having excellent staff to accompany an excellent beer selection is definitely key.

I'm from San Diego so you could say I'm spoiled when it comes to the craft beer scene but don't let that fool you, Henderson residents are very fortunate to have a place like CraftHaus in their area so that they too can enjoy some solid, local craft beer.

So... Great beer, great staff, great layout and a great crowd.  If you like beer, you should probably get over here."}
{"text":"Awesome environment and awesome beer for decent prices! Thursday night is trivia night :) 
If you're not into trivia they have other board games that you can sit around and play. Best thing is the sugar scrub in the bathroom!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Vegas for the weekend, hubby and I looked up local breweries and found this on Yelp! Really cool place! Beer is good too!"}
{"text":"Rolled down here to check out the brewery and meet fellow Yelpers Melissa and Gregg. They were giving out S'more packs for a $5 donation to Three Square so its a cool place that gives back to community. They also had a Toys for Tots donation bin going as well.

As I entered and walked up to the bar, the bartender was fondling his man boobs. Now that's an introduction! Cool guy, extremely helpful with beer selection and providing samples. I had a nice conversation with a girl who frequents the place and knows a lot about their beer. I learned more about beer tonight than ever before.

Cool place with a bar, a few tables, and they have a selection of board games you can play. I had a Saison and sampled a Sour and both were smooth, and full of flavor. 

I'll be back. This is in a building just back of the front buildings on Eastgate, right next to Bad Beat Brewing."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to visit CraftHaus! Last night, we went for the tapping of Any Which Way DIPA, which is superb. The Zitrone is a winner too. In fact, we've never had a bad beer at CraftHaus!"}
{"text":"Crafthaus is an awesome contribution to the brewery district and small business community in Henderson. The owners are bright,  friendly and great brewers to boot! The atmosphere is fun and lively and they have a fantastic community. You definitely need to visit this spot on regular basis.  :)"}
{"text":"So far so good! 

They only have 3  of their own beers available right now, but I liked everything I've tasted so far. They are currently offering the regular saison, pomegranate saison, and an IPA, and they also offer other beers on tap like lagunitas. I talked to one of the brewers and he said hopefully by next month they will be ready with a few more beers. The atmosphere is really nice and relaxing with lots of different seating options. They have tables, bar stools and even small couches. 

The owner told me that there will be another brewery opening up soon in the \"booze district\" so keep your eyes open for that! Looks like this area is really shaping up!"}
{"text":"I went for their ThreeSquare S'mores charity event on a chilly Black Friday. Two Elite yelpers also joined me (making this event that much more awesome!) along with my family who were visiting from Arizona.
What a bunch of merry makers we were! I had the Fall Maple Spice and the Any Which Way, and both were quality brews! Staff are helpful and always knowledgeable about all things beer!

The beer selection is very nice and they also have cider for those who can't commit to craft brews (it happens) The brewery was pretty busy and a nice place to take visitors and show off the \"Booze District\"! Roasting s'mores is always a good time, especially when the temps are heading south quickly! 

Check their Web or Facebook pages for special event info and releases!"}
{"text":"You really can't find a better place in the Vegas/Henderson area, to relax, have good conversation,and have an amazing beer!!!!!!!! The sasion is my favorite! My husband loves the IPA. I love that they come out with tweaked beers. I'm looking forward to trying lots more beer at this place. Everyone here is so friendly, will ask your name and remember it! I am such a fan of this place. They do not have a kitchen but have food trucks come on Saturday and you can bring in your own if you want!!!! 
I love you CraftHaus!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious beer, great local atmosphere, super friendly staff! Hopefully the area gets built up around the booze district and I will be a frequent customer! Nice job Craft Haus!"}
