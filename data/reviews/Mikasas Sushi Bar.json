{"text":"I have to say when we walked in it was not that impressive, and that was the highlight! It was downhill from there. Although the staff was friendly and moderately attentive, the food left much to be desired. The appetizers were basically chunks with mayonnaise. The sushi was dry and in some cases inedible. I actually sent 2 of the 5 rolls back.  I could say more but I think you get the point. Avoid this one, many better places around."}
{"text":"Je vous suggère le resto Mikasa intersection blvd. l'Acadie et Sauve.  J'adore ce resto car l'ambiance et le décor sont assez chic.  De plus, la musique est toujours jazzé et le bruit est au minimum surtout   C'est resto assez classe.  Avant d'amener la nourriture on vous apporte des serviettes chaude pour vous nettoyer les mains..chose assez rare.  Les sushis sont  toujours frais. Je suggère d'essayer les rouleaux qui sont accompagne avec une sauce délicieuse.  On prépare aussi un thé maison qui est très très bon.  En résumé, c'est une expérience gustative et orgasmique du palais :)"}
{"text":"Worst sushi i ate. choix du chef it s basically just cucumber and fish leftover(to save their cost). Really expansive, they robe you. The rise is disgusting. The tartare is a shame - mainly rise and you can barely feel the salmon. Warning: positive comments came from staff.   Plus mauvais des Sushis que j ai pu manger. En gros, le choix du chef c est des concombres avec un peu de poisson. Poisson plastic, tartare merdique. A eviter de toute urgence. Certains des commentaires positifs proviennent du staff."}
{"text":"Passed by this place the other day! It is now CLOSED   Went there the other night with my wife and we had a mix of sushi and some appetizers. The service was good, everyone was nice and polite. The place was 75% full, which is good for a place during the week in that area.  The prices were a bit on the higher end, but the taste is good. We liked the food and the selection.  The atmosphere is very nice and kids would also be comfortable there.  I would recommend it if you were around but not worth a long trip. I'm sure there are other nice sushi places in town such as this one."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Best sushi ever!!! Quite place.. excellent service Parking is located at the back of the restaurant Beautiful presentation !!"}
{"text":"I have gone there a few times already. The food is amazing and the ambience is really cool. The chef's menu for two, for $69, was interesting, but not the best value on the menu."}
{"text":"The price is so high , it does not taste good, its just ok not woow not yum , their famous tuna dish was cook so much and it didnt even melt in your mouth you had to chew it for so long , they have very nice decoration and thats the only reason i gave it even a star otherwise the food was not blagh i wouldnt go again"}
{"text":"Worst sushi I have ever eaten in my life. We order the sushi boat for 2 at 60$ for 34 pieces that the chef would suggest. All of them were filled with cucumber, looked like plastic and tasted like vinegar. We saw it had 4.4/5 stars on google reviews so we felt safe to try. I never write reviews but in this case I thought it was important since I have not experienced 4 stars at all. If you are really looking for sushi... Go to a sushi shop, it will be less expensive and way better quality! Don't waist your money, stay away!"}
