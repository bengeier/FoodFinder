{"text":"For anyone who complains read this before you do. Go to any other restaurant and Tell me how much they charge you for only two meals(aka Bamiyan, Kandahar, Caravan, Watan, and last but not least Pamier kabob).its gonna be around 40$. Be happy to find RICE that's cooked PROPERLY in the Afghani way. Not some 45 minute rice cooker then served to you right away. There naans are always fresh without a doubt they make it on the spot when you order. MOST other restaurants keep there naans in the warmer cause they are LAZY to make fresh naan every order. I could go on and on about why this place is very good and loyal to there food when it comes to cooking Afghan food. Overall in my opinion the waiters deserved to be tipped very well because your basically paying half of what you pay in any other Afghan restaurant. Hands down to this place. I will always go to this place because they are the most humble people ever. If you have read all of this thank you for your time. Always keep this in your mind."}
{"text":"Decent kebabs. The chicken nuggets were not at all that. We were served deep fried oily pieces of chicken as nuggets. There was no batter or breadcrumbs at all. The butter chicken was weird. Don't really know how to explain it. 
The burger was actually a thin chapli kebab in a bun. 
The baklava tastes old and so soggy. 
The bathroom was dirty with overflowing bin."}
{"text":"Came on a number of occasions.  Their jouja kabob and butter chicken are the best.  Their dinners come with tandoori naan instead of the Afghan style naan-  different from other afghani restaurants in town.  But still good, a light and fresh flatbread.  The kabobs are not overly spiced and prepared well.  Overall delicious! Great, friendly service too."}
{"text":"Great place overall, ordered an order of the beef kabob and chicken kabob. Meat tasted good and had good flavour, salad was lacking didnt have much in it and barely any sauce."}
