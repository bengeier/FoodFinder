{"text":"I had an eggs Benedict and it was great but customer service was lacking. You have to stand up and look for them or else they won't even come to your table and I clearly chose eggs Benedict under the eggs Benedict side but we got an omelette so I called the waitress back and she gave us attitude saying we should have been more clear.. Okay?? Maybe it was just a bad morning for her but the potatoes were also not fully cooked they were like frozen wedges that were left out to thaw and then served. Other than the potatoes and customer service"}
{"text":"First time here. Overall not a terribly bad experience. Basic breakfast just under 8 bucks but I felt gouged when I was charged an additional 2.95 for the smallest portion of beans you could imagine. Food was good, service was not. They can definitely use an extra waitress or two. Like previous reviews have mentioned you literally have to stand up to get someone to come and see you. If your not in a rush I could recommend this place. Nice, clean and warm.
Cheers!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why no one ever wrote a review about this place! I haven't been to this place since its opening & I was looking for a breakfast place & thought of this one. I ordered eggs & crêpe aux fraises
 My daughter ordered the Giant plate. Plates came fast, I uually don't eat potatoes but these ones were just crazy delicious. The crêpes, ham, sausages were as good. Service, food were great. The decor needs revamping. I will certainly go back."}
{"text":"Service courtois et rapide malgré le grand nombre de gens qui voulaient bruncher le 28 décembre. 
J'ai choisi l'omelette brie et champignons.  Je m'avoue déçue par les champignons un peu sec, cuits depuis trop longtemps...  Les pommes chaudes à la cannelle en a côté étaient très bonnes."}
