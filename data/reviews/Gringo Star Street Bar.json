{"text":"My sister and I went there post fireworks on the 4th of July. It is like the Tardis. It is totally bigger on the inside. At first you see the bar and think that is it, but then you turn the corner and see 2 N64 video game systems. Needless to say, my sister stayed here most of the evening. 

Everyone was friendly and although the bartenders were extremely busy, I was able to get my drinks after my turn. 

After the bar, past the N64's you turn left and it is more games, arcades, skeeball and music. 

Even past that...you get seats for bottle service and another bar area. It was hard to find a good spot to dance, but the music was good, the people who work there were friendly and efficient and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it was hard to dance (but it may not be intended for that) and I didn't try the food, so it is not my place to rate the food. 

Really nice surprise. Thanks for a great night!"}
{"text":"Cannot recommend if you are older than 23.  It's a combo sports/video game bar.  Poor service and poor food.  Wings were bad.  Atmosphere worse. Had  to sit next to two men playing Mario and screaming vulgar obscenities at the screen while the two waitresses flirted with the bartender and ignored the customers.  Give it a pass."}
{"text":"Well first of all it is a great place to be good music and decent drink prices. The stupid part is the \"dress code\" not sure if they are aware but mill ave isnt the most glamorous place in AZ. I wasn't allowed in cause of my high tops, which is stupid cause more then 95% of people on mill wear them, the worst part was I was wearing boot cut pant so no ome could see what shoes I was wearing. This place lost a regular customer."}
{"text":"After a bad night on mill my boyfriend and I decided to go somewhere a little more relaxed. The place was still going off a bit, but we decided to stay and even ventured off to the club side. There we were served by a smiling, friendly, and attentive bartender (qualities combined are nearly nonexistent in the area). It literally made our night to see someone so kind and warm. Needless to say we tipped her generously. Eventually one of the managers met with us to thank us and get an opinion. Not only we were thanked with kind words and good company, but with several shots. We would never tip for reward, but it certainly made us feel welcome and appreciated. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Currently sitting in Gringo Star.......waiting.......
Poor service! No attention! Can I get a drink?!?!?  Its a good thing the music is great!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible..... i paid for a $9 margarita that was literally salt water. The beer was room temperature. My friend and I went in for happy hour and we asked the waitress what their happy hour menu was and she told us she didn't know and told us she would get back with us on their specials and never did. Finally found the menu hidden under the old nintendo64 console and we ordered the bacon wrapped hotdog, fried ocra, and wings. The food was COLD!!! It sucks because we could've just gone to Hooters upstairs or Big Bang downstairs but we wanted to try something new and we were completley dissapointed. I HIGHLY WARN AGAINST GOING TO THIS PLACE!!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"}
{"text":"Just left this place after waiting 20 mins for service at our table or for at least some acknowledgment of our presence. My husband went to the bar in hopes of getting us drinks and waited ther for another 10 mins or so and the bartenders would walk by without even looking at him. They were mostly busy watching the Sun Devils game. We were looking forward to trying out some of their menu items, but oh well, we are definitely not setting foot at this place again."}
{"text":"My purse was stolen in November of 2013. My phone, keys, and wallet among other things were in it. It was unclear if it was a prank or if someone dropped it off somewhere. Regardless, the next afternoon when the bars opened my mom and I went to numerous bars on Mill Avenue. Gringo Star was one of them. I asked the bar tender twice if my purse was found there, told them the color, etc. etc. The bar tender looked at me and said no no one found a purse. He didn't check with anyone else nor leave his post behind the bar. The experience cost me around 500.00 We had to have someone come out and laser cut a key so I could get my car, I had to order a new phone, buy new makeup, and also have my house rekeyed since they had all my keys and my drivers license. March 2014, I receive an email from a friend of mine on Facebook telling me some guy in Tempe has my purse at this restaurant. When I contacted this person and the Manager, I was basically told... woopsies, it was black and it was sitting where the wait staff put their purses so no one knew that it was there. It was not in the lost and found because that bin was TOO full. I went to retrieve it, everything was in the purse except for my phone. All my cards, medicine, makeup, keys, etc just not my phone. I picked the purse up that following saturday and the new bar back offered to buy me a drink next time I came in. Welp thank you for that DRINK... now that you cost me 500.00 when it would have been rectified saved me the 500.00 had someone actually checked the back. I've never had food or drinks at the business but based on this I will not be supporting this business nor recommend it to anyone I know."}
{"text":"**This review is based off of after-hour experience (when it is a bar/club after 10pm and not a restaurant)**

I cannot speak for the food or quality of it as a functioning restaurant, because I have never been here for that. Anyone who frequents Mill regularly knows that this is one of the most popular places on the strip...everyone stops in here at some point throughout the night. 

It is the most overrated bar experience I have ever seen. There is literally nothing special about it. Rather, it is the most overpacked, douche-inspiring, child-festered bar on Mill. Full of just-turned-21 kids who cannot hold their alcohol to save their lives. The lines to get a drink will have you waiting literally 10+ minutes, and even then you STILL have to be aggressive waiving your cash or credit card at the bartender to get him to ask you what you want. 

The music is stupid loud for the type of environment it strives to achieve...like honestly what is this place? An arcade? A dive bar? A cocktail lounge? A table and bottle service night club? It is the most theme-confused place I have ever been to. Its really no wonder why their other bar, American Junkie in Old Town Scottsdale went out of business (same owner, or at least it was).

Now lets talk line to even get into the damn place. Sure, I understand the whole \"I know the bouncer, he will let us in\" thing...but my God, it seems like the bouncers know EVERYONE and let everyone just walk right up to them, give them a nice little pat on the back, and wave them right in. I mean literally, for every 1 person he lets in from the peasant line, they let 10 people just walk up and right in. To make matters worse, there are two lines you can wait it: the normal free line, or a shorter \"fast pass\" line that you can pay $$ to not have to wait as long. So, if your not an idiot, you will wait in the free line. This means that between the bouncers letting their current friends, their friends friends, their friends friends second cousin that they are friends with on Facebook, some hot girl they they walked past on campus, and so on in before the people waiting in line, now you have to pretty much watch the entire fast pass line clear out before they even begin to look at the normal liners. Its crazy.

**Also, if you are a good looking girl, disregard everything about the line issues, as you can pretty much walk right up to the bouncers, bat your pretty little eyes, and walk right in**

I hate this place."}
{"text":"I have been here a half dozen times, and at first it was great. Play some classic arcade games, and have some reasonably priced(for mill) drinks. The music can be way too loud at times and give the place a rave feel that I don't prefer. The DJ also place the same 3 long remixes all night long. The loud music and strange crowd is not enough to keep me away, but a recent experience with the staff may mean giving up on this place. A group of friends and I had gone out to celebrate a birthday, and door staff was really friendly to us as we entered until the last person in our group was denied entry. This was our first stop of the night. No one was intoxicated and we were all fairly dressed up for the night. Their reasoning was that my friend was wearing high tops. These were penguin high tops covered by his jeans. I  not even sure how they noticed what kind of shoes he had on, but apparently hightops are a cardinal sin here. Friendly door guy went to an asshole in a heartbeat when my friend asked if he was serious or if he could talk to the manager about it. Mind you we had all been here several tines in the past and never had an issue. At the request for the manager my friend was told, \"Go somewhere else if you don't fucking like it!\" Not that we had much choice since they were not letting him in...
I basically just won't be coming here for quite awhile. It can be a nice place, but as soon as you get comfortable here you may catch a dose of the bad everyone else has mentioned."}
{"text":"These guys rejected 5 different completely legitimate 23 year old IDs. Their bouncers could not be dumber, maybe they should hire someone who's actually graduated grade school to run their doors. I mean I understand addition is hard but these douchebags couldn't pass a basic ASU math class which is why they're bouncing at Gringo Stars"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials!  We ordered our wings extra crispy and they were PERFECT! Our street tacos and nachos were also delicious and they have free chips and salsa during hh.  This will be our place to eat when we are on Mill."}
{"text":"Went in here on a Thursday night with a couple of friends. We thought it would be pretty fun to get some drinks and play some classic arcade games. Getting a drink from an uninterested bar staff took longer than it should have, but it happens on Mill. The worst part (and reason for the one star) was the security staff. When trying to go out the front door, we were turned away to go \"out the back\". Then when heading to the back, asked which side we had to go out (east or west), the bouncer replied \"what the f*ck do you think?\". I guess we interrupted him while he was holding up the counter. Well, F this place, there are plenty of other places on Mill."}
{"text":"Came here on a snoozy Tues. afternoon. Happy hour is excellent. Waitress was courteous, and fairly attentive. I think on a busy weekend things could get behind. 

Big plus was the prices were great for the quality and variety of food.  Best described as a \"munchies\" menu. Some entree items, but filled with tons of appetizers, all of which were good. 

The atmosphere was nice, separate booth, with a decent bar selection and some tables. 

Music was..all over the place- though not crazy loud until later around 6:00. 

What bumps this up from a 3 star to 4 was the variety, quality and price point of food, as well as the privacy of booths. 

Would recommend for small groups, casual meetings, and just dinner and drinks with friends. Decimates not a get in and out place, on the hand they don't rush you either. 

I will most definitely return."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday for a Birthday Happy Hour!  Very impressed.  Excellent service. Friendly waitress who came around at just the right time. The food was excellent.  I think I had the best wings I've ever had.  They crunched..So Yummy!!  Lettuce Wraps...wow!!  Everything was very tasty and while I did read a review that said they had to go to a window and order then go pick it up themselves....I have to say I never saw a 'window' and we had a waitress that was very attentive, took our orders and served our drinks and food.  They have booths that are a really nice size; they fit a good bit of people (8+) for conversation, so no need to separate your party.  The atmosphere was great, staff great, food great! And for all you girls out there the Bathrooms were Clean!!  As I said we were there for Happy Hour and they had amazing prices for drinks and food.  I have to honestly say \"I'VE FOUND MY NEW FUN SPOT!!  Next time I shall partake in some of the video games.."}
{"text":"Apparently, hi tops are a huge no no at this bar and when I asked if I could just pull my pants over them absolutely not. The bouncers are a bunch of tools in overly tight pink shirts that make me question if they are meant as security or entertainment. Needless to say, I took my business elsewhere and had a good time. Sorry I don't look like a skinny jeans wearing douche bag but I guess that's why they call it gringo!"}
{"text":"Apparently arcade bars now come with dress codes & unbeknown to me, there's a huge difference between flip flops & athletic sandals. It gets to be 115+ degrees in Phoenix during the summer, & my fiancé was denied entry because he was wearing \"athletic sandals\" as opposed to flip flops. It was the most absurd ridiculous load of crap I've ever heard. Gringo Star Street Bar... They don't allow you to play skee ball in athletic sandals, but flip flops are okay. LOL! We had 6 friends inside waiting for us, but they all left when they found out we couldn't come inside."}
{"text":"cuban sandwich is really good!  minus 1 star because i cant eat luch here.. not open until 2.  Otherwise i might come here once a week!  Good food though when they open"}
{"text":"Really impressed with this place.  I've driven bye it several times and I had no clue how big it was. I went in on Saturday for my best friends birthday and from the dj all the way to the bouncers - everything was spot on.  I also now know where all the hot ASU girls are hanging out.  
I was a little weary about staying to party in Tempe instead of going to party in Old Town Scottsdale, but we made the right call for sure.  Thanks Gringo Star for keeping it real, I'll be seeing you all this weekend."}
{"text":"Great place perfect location but the $$$ kinda high when its not busy... But clean and new"}
{"text":"Went in with some friends during the day. Our bartender's name was Eric, he was really professional and really good-looking. Drinks were amaze-balls!! And the food was pretty good. The chicken drumsticks are the best on Mill! Go in and ask for Eric!"}
{"text":"This place is across the street from my work and it has become my favorite lunch place in one week. The misters outside keep the outside bar cool (there are 2 bars) so even when it's hot out, I can eat outside. The food is awesome. I've had the shaved beef (basically an Italian beef sandwich), bacon burger (complete w/ egg) and sweet/sour shrimp - all have been delicious and all are under $7. Pretty amazing. It's designed to feel like an 80's arcade, so lots of black paint and cheesy graffiti. Normally I'd say that's corny, but in the context of an 80's arcade, complete with plenty of arcade cabinets, it's pretty spot on. 2 small gripes - if you don't know where to order (like the guy in the other review) you might feel a bit lost. There's a spot on the far east side of the building to order, no waitresses. Also, the beer selection on the outside bar is pretty pitiful. Bud light? No thanks. All in all though, it's deff my new lunch spot."}
{"text":"Best motherfucking bar in Tempe on a Wednesday night, best service ever, nick is the shit!"}
{"text":"I guess if you are going for drinks and typical bar food you would give this place more stars.  I bought a groupon to try the place and was expecting more of a restaurant / bar than just a bar.  I was not sure how to spend my Groupon after seeing it was just a bar (I don't drink).  After trying the food I was waiting for Gordon Ramsey to come through the door but he never did.  So go for the drinks, definitely not the food.  Tried 3 things on the menu and none were good.  The waitress was very good though so kudos to her."}
{"text":"Out of all the bars to go to on Mill, Gringo is the best. It is always a ton of fun and the music is great on the weekends after 10. I wouldn't go here to eat because honestly, who goes to these places to eat? So no comments on the food.

Now that El Hefe is open, though, I'm not sure how much longer this will be my number 1 spot in Tempe. Stiff competition."}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe!  The staff is awesome and they've got great food and drinks as well as great deals!"}
{"text":"I like this place. I arrived at this place on a thursday afternoon 3pm.  i love retro games so the Arcade games inside was great.   The bacon burger was good. They could have used a bigger meat patty but it's okay.

 Bartender was a hot blonde and the server was a cute looking brunette. :)

 I will go back to this bar soon. maybe on a Saturday night, hope to meet many good looking college chicks at this place. :)"}
{"text":"Had a great experience and felt like home. Nick is a great manager? But he was awesome and gave us a great experience. Also I'm a woman, but your cocktailers are hot!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a beer and wings today. No service. No greeting. No \"I'll be right with you\". We were there for more than 10 minutes with servers turning a blind eye. Will not go there again."}
{"text":"I work in the area so I pretty much check out any new place serving lunch.  Walked into this place today and had a seat.  Wanted to see what was up with the wide variety on the relatively small menu.(Bacon wrapped dog/Chicken gyro/Green chili pork/Korean spiced beef) Waited for 15 mins and no one said a word to me. Not one word.  I saw between 1-3 employees.   Now this place is fairly big, and I was the only on the Eastern side.   There was a bartender the entire time I was there.  About 15 feet from me.  You may be wondering if the place was packed and the bartender was slammed.  Not so much.  There were two other guys there who finished their meal after I was there about 10 mins.  When I walked out, it was just me, the bartender, air and opportunity.  Now I'm sure some of you would have made your presence known and tried to get some service.  Eh, I wasn't in the mood for that, so I just left.  I was confident in the fact that there were other places selling food on downtown Mill.  I may try it again another day.  In the meantime, here's a lil' something to remember me by."}
{"text":"I often don't write reviews but I feel absolutely compelled to do so for the sake of others. 

Went on a Friday night, so I expected it to be busy (please also keep in mind this was my 2nd time to this bar) and it was.  My friends and I found a place to sit and waited about 10 mins until a waitress came over to take our drink order. Once she came back to the table with our drinks, she had asked if we wanted anything to eat. We all wanted to order a few appitizers that were listed on the menu for \"happy hour\" prices (Nachos & Pickle chips). I'm NOT exaggerating when I tell you that about 45 mins later, one more round of drinks and 3 reminders later there was no sign of our food. 

A bar back came to our table while the waitress was standing there (taking or 3rd round of drink order down), with a plate of Nachos only to find out they were'nt meant for us. We asked our server why it was taking so long!? She replied \"I dont know and I will go check on the order status for us.\" She came back to our table about 10 mins later to express her apologies, as she \"forgot to enter our food order\". REALLY! 

My friends and I imediatley asked for our check and to cancel or 3rd round of drinks because we did'nt want to be in that place 1 second longer. 

The worst experience ever, I wish I could recall the servers name but it really does'nt matter. What does matter is that they lost a customer and word will spread quickly

Very very poor service!!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and had a friend visiting from out of state so we decided to try out some bars on Mill. Clearly we walked into the wrong bar. I don't know if we didn't fit the look they like to have there (trashy......?) or what? Maybe we were dressed a little too nice or something. We sat down at the bar and were ignored for a good 10 minutes and then we each ordered a Long Island. The guy comes back with our drinks in those big, red, plastic coca-cola water cups... With what tasted like pure soda. $9 sodas. Really?! And not a single other person had drinks in those giant water cups. Who serves a Long Island in a coca-cola water cup??? Stupid bartenders I guess. We asked if he could make it stronger and he rambled something about it being some percentage alcohol and then walked away. We were about to just walk out when he came over and poured a \"Long Island mix\" into the cup. They don't even know how to make a real Long Island. Anyway, it tasted terrible although slightly stronger so we drank half of them and walked out. Will never return."}
{"text":"Pretty sweet spot! Has an old school feeling with the old school video games including TWO N64 systems at the booths.  One game that stood out was the skee ball where you can earn points to win free drinks.  Haven't tried the food yet, but I've heard some good things about it, so will definitely be trying the food soon."}
{"text":"Stopped by gringo for a beer and some wings. They had 312 on tap which was great as always and I had the Happy Hour wing special 10 wings for $5. Can't beat that!! Bartender Katie was great as well."}
{"text":"Was in there last night and was having a good time spending money and listening to music. That all ended when the manager got on the bar and started spraying champagne. Who the hell wants to walk around sticky and smelling of shitty champagne?!?! I was one of at least 15 people that left pissed off immediately after. Won't be back. Not cool."}
{"text":"These reviews are pretty funny. I have gone to about 4 or 5 different places trying to find the right fit, we just moved here from San Diego. The bartenders aren't douchey or expecting you to be a student. This place was crowded when we came and the bartenders still acknowledged us. That's all I need, to be acknowledged when we come to the bar or get a table. If you're over the age of 21, this is a great bar to head to. You won't have to worry about those bartenders who assume you're a student so they just act like your money doesn't matter and ignore you. Every bartender asked how we were doing. I like that. Come here if you want service at a REAL bar."}
{"text":"Nice place but don't believe the sign out front about the best chicken wings in town , don't trust it !!! I don't know where or who told em that.... But overall everything else was up to par. When you order a drink you get free chips and salsa but you have to ask for it it's upon request only.."}
{"text":"Service was great but it was a slow evening. Tried their falafel burger and it was pretty bad. I really don't think that falafel should be made into a burger patty. And on top of that I realized that I had food poisoning that evening when I got home. Just be careful what you order. Otherwise, great service and liquor/beer selection."}
{"text":"I have been to many places around mill and have enjoyed all the bars before gringo star took over. I gave this place a shot and upon entering it felt like an underground dark bar, something not quite far off what you'd experience in the movie Lost Boys minus the cool vampires and cool vibes that would bring. Instead it was just a musty wet bar. I'd think it'd have safety violations from the slippery yet sticky floors. People spraying champagne and beer all over people and the ground. Yuck. You couldnt navigate through the sweat and smelly place. Never again."}
{"text":"Since writing my initial review, I received a message from a manager at Gringo Star and he apologized for my not so great experience, even though it definitely wasn't his fault.  He proceeded to offer to buy me a few rounds next time I come in for a more enhanced experience.

I am giving 5 stars this time because he is representing the business in a  good way, and his message was very nice and courteous even if my review was sorta mean.  I was just trying to be descriptive and super honest as possible."}
{"text":"If you so happen to get the African American fella Tyler, mmmm mmm lemme stop you there.. if you value your time don't come here. You'll wait like 20-30 mins for a WELL or a BEER. He'll take other people's orders before yours in your face & even if you tip him he'll have you escorted out by security, which is super awesome and understanding. Tyler was just mad he got a ton of change BUT HE GOT A DOLLAR TOO! So I'm not that evil. Either it's Tyler's fault or management for not hiring more bartenders. The barback is awesome though :) but! Say hi to the super cool security with the pretty hair and gorgeous face :)"}
{"text":"Ridiculous food and great service.  The lettuce wraps are out of this world and while I know I cant replicate them at home, I know i will try.  Terrific experience!"}
{"text":"I was squished against the bar until I couldn't breathe. And the guy wasn't kicked out. They are full of ratchets"}
{"text":"Very laid back place with retro arcade games and Nintendo 64 on some of the wall tables for you to play with old school games.  The service was friendly and pretty quick.  not a fan of the plastic draft beer glasses, that were more like scotch glasses, only knock. Food was pretty good and great happy hour prices on drinks and some snacks. Would definitely like to go back."}
{"text":"Came here today to celebrateca friends and birthday and had a fun time with some of the customers. Good music, even tho the one DJ that was there at the end didn't quite know how to fade between songs to make a smooth transition, still had fun."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a \"game\"! Awesome happy hour! I believe the happy hour goes till 9pm! Can't beat $3 22oz Bud Light (being from MKE I would prefer Miller though) & $5 for 10 wings! They have a bunch of arcade machines plus a 64 to play Blitz table side! It's definitely a college bar but a nice one at that!"}
{"text":"Great spot, always packed, awesome people and hands down the best spot to celebrate a SunDevil Victory!"}
{"text":"This place is a BLAST at night on the weekends! Good crowd, great music, solid space for dancing and sitting both, fairly priced drinks, and an overall great time with no cover charge and seldom a long line."}
{"text":"This place has an extended Happy Hour, it's almost a Happy HalfDay.  Seems like theres a lot of room inside but we sat outside. I had the burger and I actually forget what my wife had but we both enjoyed it.  Sports on the TV, server was really good and I liked their house drinks."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this bar. The bar is extremely bland, and the staff just doesn't care. Came in after opening just to be ignored by the bartender on a slow night. Put some stuff on the walls, and hire a staff that actually cares."}
{"text":"Bouncers here are rude and disrespectful. Decided to check this place out last friday night. One of my friends who was not 21 paid the bouncers 40 bucks to get in. My other friend who is 21 was denied access because the bouncers said they don't allow Jordan sneakers. I went inside to check out the place and besides cheap drinks this place needs a lesson in customer service and federal laws."}
{"text":"Went here for some drinks and food with my friends... Great decor... Service was friendly... Just a weird setup.  You have to order from a window without a server.   My burger was not very good... It was dry and slathered in mayo without notice. 

but  they have video games!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour rolls from 3-9pm, clearly exceeding my happy Hour hours expectations. Can't beat $2 domestic drafts. Just stopped in for a beer with a few others on a Saturday afternoon. Guess we picked the absolute worst time because three loud Frat boy drunks or maybe just punks were cursing their way through our entire 45 minutes there, yelling weird noises and acting like it was their first time with some alcohol in their hands. The bar is pretty big, although the back bar was closed, but once we got away from them, it was a decent experience. Bartender should be tossing these folks out, not serving them more poison. 
     The skee ball is the most inventive part of the place offering free drinks for a score of 450, which you will have a hard time achieving, plus $2 buys you a drink anyway, so this is useless. In the good ole days, those 100 point slots were not there, but then again skee ball was actually 10 cents when I was roaming the arcades. The TV situation was good, but this place may be at a disadvantage when the weather turns better with no patio. Pac man was the only worthy arcade game out of only five in the place and the manager wouldn't tell us who the communist looking guy was that adorns all the walls in the place. No, we don't want to guess for you to buy us a $2 beer, just tell us and get it over with. Ohh such a big secret. It is not even a person, it is all photo-shoppped, so stop being so secretive dude."}
{"text":"The staff is attentive, the music good and the security is top notch. Always make it a point to hit this spot. The food is actually really great I had the hummus plate and it was fresh and had cooked eggplant, it really did it for me!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. It has officially made it to my favorite place on mill. I was looking for something like this on mill actually. It has a mini arcade, which encompasses a Nintendo 64 with games! (Yes, they have Smash Bros as well as some other popular games, yeah you bet I played on that.) And they have a large dance floor with a DJ - and played a lot of hip hop music (swoon - this place just keeps getting better). 

I came on a Thursday night and we peaked in at around 11 and it was dead, then came back around at 12:30/1:00 and it was packed. So don't be fooled, it'll get packed for sure, maybe even more than you'll like. But I think it was perfect - just enough people on the dance floor to get it poppin and just enough space to be able to actually move.

I was here to drink and dance so I didn't get to try the food, but all of these reviews with photos are making my mouth water and go back for it! Next time!

Well the bathrooms were questionable, but not too bad. No lines though, which was good. 

Oh and there's two bars, one at the front entrance and one around the corner at the back. There are also couches all the way in the back too. Super comfy ones! :)

In addition to everything wonderful previously stated, there's also a long patio. 

I guess the only negative is that the staff were 100% busy all of the time, so they couldn't get to you right away, you'd have to wait. In addition, the floor was massively wet and dirty and should have been cleaned up immediately for all the spillage that occurred that night instead of letting people splash through it. I think they need more staff to be able to stay on top of all the mayhem that continually happens. But overall, it's a great place and is definitely now my favorite on mill ave."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I rented beach cruisers on Saturday and rode over to Mill Avenue for a bar hop. He told me we just HAD to try Gringo Star because he loved it. It was dead, as expected for 2pm on a Saturday but the bartenders were great and the mozzarella sticks were delicious. This review is specifically for a few things, one- the bartender, Felicia, made us feel totally at home, and she didn't have to. We ordered food and our crown & 7's and we all cracked jokes with the people that were at the bar, waiting for the Derby to start, etc. When we told them we were leaving to cruise on, they joked that we would be back, and we didn't realize it, but we were back later. We went to Handlebar and were sorely disappointed and decided to come on back. Sure enough, we waltzed back in and were greeted with smiles and drinks, Felicia suggested we try a Crown Apple & 7 instead of our regular drinks, got me a redbull as the sun was wearing me out, and set us up to play some MarioKart. The afternoon staff was coming in, they were all friendly, and the manager, I think his name was Harley, was funny and informative to everyone who had questions about the fight. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good staff, good drinks, and a good time. 

Thanks for a great Saturday!"}
{"text":"Stumbling through the 110 degree desert I had found myself in, I came to what could only have been a mirage. A place calling itself a \"street bar\" with free arcade games and hooters upstairs. I was so dehydrated and delirious, I swore I was seeing things wrong. What did it all mean? My emaciated and sun burnt body could do nothing more than to venture into the mirage.

My friends.... this was a true oasis. I was immediately greeted with cold, flowing air blowing all around me. Cute girls in daisy dukes and tank tops were all over the place. A Galaga machine came to life in the corner. Televisions were playing strange competitions with men wielding sticks being pelted with balls. I thought for certain I was hallucinating. 

I took a seat at the bar and a cute female approached and told me it was happy hour from 2 until 9. Surely I had misheard her. That's not happy hour. That's happy all day. $2 beers, cheap food, cheap shots, cheap drinks. WHERE WAS I??!!

The menu was small and weird and I thought someone must be playing a joke on me. Bacon wrapped hot dog? Chicken drumsticks? Korean Style Beef? I settled on the Brat that came with caramelized onions and pickled cabbage and house mustard and it came in something of a bread pocket that seemed like it was baked just to house the sausage. Quite delicious. It started bringing me back to my senses. Some tater tots came perfectly crispy but not burnt and with what I think was queso fresco on top? Or maybe it was the cheese of the gods because they surely must have sent me to this little desert hideaway. God cheese.

If I ever find myself stuck in the desert again, I will surely look for this miracle amongst the sands."}
{"text":"Yeah like most people on here who have written bad reviews about this place my complaint is with the method of operation of the door staff.  These guys are a very special and unique group who all seem to be sharing the same brain. Unfortunately, the night we attempted to enter the most glamorous bar on mill, the brain must have gone to some other dude because the guy we spoke to clearly was not \"it\" that night.


What it comes down to is these guys really enjoy flexing their exclusionary muscle whenever they want. If they don't want you in that bar they will find a reason. (Checkout some of the other negative reviews). 

See one member of our party made the mistake of wearing high top shoes that night, and the door staff feels more gang members wear high top shoes compared to low top shoes. None of the 5 other bars we visited that night gave two $%&T's about the type of shoe he was wearing probably because it is a bunch of  made up nonsense. Plus with that small army of police marching up and down mill all night, is gang activity really a problem?

These guys also don't understand the situations that such BS can create. That night the only Hispanic member of our group was wearing the sinister high tops and therefore was not allowed entrance while us white boys were allowed in. Regardless of the door staff's justification the \"dress code\" creates these type of situations and it's going to piss people off. The only response we got was \"why don't you cry about it some more\".  These belittling type of comments only make a bad situation worse. With an obviously racially biased dress code you would think a better explanation would be ready to go. The dress code has the effect of disproportionately excluding minority patrons relative to white patrons, but apparently it's a blast if you get in."}
{"text":"Hahaha this place is joke....  Because I'm wearing basketball shorts I can't get into the bar really?  First off I have a  non crimal back ground and took one look at me like I'm a fool.  Second of all I've faught for My country and I was in 140 degree heat why would I wear pants when it's nice out and third of all,  they need to get bigger shirts..  Shmediums don't look good if your a bouncer.  I also would have been a high paying customer I make great money I would spend money there but now you lost my business for good but I'll make sure all my friends know don't go there at all they can't afford us to have shorts on...  Oh and another excuse was that they are black short....  This place can stick to the skinny jean society...  Thank you..."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with friends.  Cool new place on Mill.  Great music with above average food.  The artwork and games put this place over the top."}
{"text":"Despite the negative reviews of this place i went anyway.

I was NOT dissapointed.

I went there around 3 pm and wasnt aware of happy hour. Their happy hour deals are insane. $3 Four peaks drafts. $6 cocktails. $4 chicken drumsticks. You cant beat their prices. So with that said i went a little crazy. Ill give you a review of all the things i got:

Bacon burger - Phenominal. The buns arent your regular fare. They are some sort of toasted, maybe sourdough. The bacon was meaty, the cheese and toppings were good. 

Chicken drumsticks - The way they made/served these was fun. They take the meat and push it down towards the bigger part of the drumstick like they do in higher end reastaurants. Covered it in a sweet barbecue sauce, then instead of serving it with blue cheese, they sprinkled CRUMBLES on all the pieces. 

Sweetpotato fries - Pretty good. They are served with ketchup (would have preferred dijon mustard) and they sprinkled maybe shredded parmesean? 

Chili pork - No. The meat tasted like it was sitting for a while. It was pretty bland. The old lady liked it but after having all the other amazing food....it just wasnt up to standard.

Gringo Donut - Dont be fooled, this isnt a donut. BUT ITS SO FUN. They take a friend dough (similar to those fried sugar donut things at chinese restaurants) put 2 bananas on it , with some vanilla pudding and nutella. if i could curse on here i would. it was amazing

Turkey brat - This one was street food done classy. A brat, topped with bright pink cabbage, some random toppings. THe best part was the toasted (chibatta?) bread they put it in. It was nice and crunchy like french bread.

It was a little loud in there but...its a bar on mill. What do you want...Fred Astaire? its a bar...with VIDEOGAMES...and STREET FOOD. Service was good. No complaints. Smiles and friendly. Attentive. 

To wrap it all up; even the NON happy hour prices are still legit. The service was good, the crowd at 5 pm was decent, nice bug beautiful windows to look out of, and the food....OH the food was amazing. Seriously, just try it once. You cant always take peoples word on these reviews. Generally people come on here when they have something to complain about. TRY IT!"}
{"text":"It's a fun little bar on mill ave. If you're planning on getting wasted, come during happy hour!!! Drinks and wings are super cheap during time...obviously AND you can enjoy fun little arcade games while you're waiting for that buzz to kick in!
Also turns into a fun little nightclub ;)"}
{"text":"If you're looking to bring back some memories, gringo is the place to be. Not only is the staff on top of it, but the interior, quality, and space is so much fun. I come to gringo at least once a week and it's always popping off Thursday nights. If you're looking for a great time on mill, head here because you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"At first I like it and had no problem getting in but some of the bouncers are racist! I go to ASU and still got more money then the bouncers but their straight up douche bags and racist! first of minorities beware because if your not white or wearing skinny jeans with cheap chuck Taylors your not getting in no matter what! I'm in a frat and got denied at least 6 times for not having low tops, slacks too baggy, or my hat was too ghetto for them. Plus when you get in the drinks are expensive and their poorly made by the bar tenders who don't care about their work! I wouldn't recommend this bar to any minority because they won't let you in unless your a girl or white male and it use to be nice place that's going down hill fast."}
{"text":"I am probably not the target demographic for this bar, but still decided to stop in one Saturday afternoon for a drink and some quick eats.  The food was cheap and actually pretty decent and they had a good selection of beer.  Nice bartenders too!"}
{"text":"African Americans beware, this establishment will judge you based on your appearance as long as you are who you are. I was allowed in because I wasn't a problem for them. I'm wearing slacks a button down shirt and polo boots. Tell me why they needed to discuss if I should be let in? 

Most of their patrons are wearing jeans, cheap button down shirts and tennis shoes. If this isn't racism at its best in the valley of the sun, I don t know what being oppressed or racially profiled is. 

Don't f@#! with Gringo Star! They don't like minorities, kittens, or babies."}
{"text":"Great service. Randy is a really good bar tender and pays attention to detail. Great customer service and great happy hour specials"}
{"text":"This bar is horrible. Between my group of girlfriends, there has been 2 incidents of roofies! This place is disgusting and the men are sleazy. As soon as you walk in, they try to shove drinks down your throat so that 15 minutes later, you don't know where you are. LADIES, BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!!!!! It's not a safe spot to be drinking and for some reason they attract the lowest of the low here."}
{"text":"Fun! I love video games. From SD and we have a place sort of like this but this one is def larger and has more games. Good times."}
{"text":"Great bar for 49ers fans! I am from California and went to watch a Niners game and this was such an amazing atmosphere. The only reason they got 4 stars and not 5 is on game days they have \"special\" food. Don't eat it. The food was sitting for hours under a warmer (at least it tasted like it was) Other than that I had an amazing time I even won in their raffle! I will be back when I'm in town and the Niners are playing I'll just make sure to eat before."}
{"text":"UPDATED This place has gone way downhill.

OLD REVIEW It does get pretty crowded because it's so popular. If you want to avoid the crowds, don't go after about 11:00 PM, if you like the crowds and the action, you'll love it after 11 PM. I wish they would make the patio no smoking."}
{"text":"Man, if you are just yearning to ruin your night and to hangout with a bunch of douche bags, just come on over to Gringo to be treated like absolute horse manure. Woo! 

This is seriously the douchiest bar ever. I had been drinking (oh heavens no, at a bar!!?!!?) and I left my phone on the bar counter. I wanted to go back into look but they said no since it's near closing and you are too intoxicated. I mean, I was intoxicated, but I even suggested someone walk in with me so I could look really quickly then immediately leave and they wouldn't do it. 

Mind you, I'm aware that the odds of my phone still being there are slim to none, but they didn't even let me go into check or ask the bartender if he might have picked it up. They told me to come back in the morning. Excuse me??? I don't want to come back in the morning, I want to see if my 370 dollar phone and the low odds of it still being there are NOW. I've never had this much trouble at a bar before. 
Their bouncers are absolutely ridiculous and need to be directed on how to not completely mistreat their customers! Not friendly, overrated, overpacked, they obviously don't care for their P A Y I N G customers. and actually has a strict dress code. On Mill Avenue. Seriously?"}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour.  Took the light rail into Tempe to check out Mill Ave.  Super friendly service, with a great beer selection.  

Recommendations:
Get the Carne Asada street tacos, some of the best I've ever had.  Pair it with the Kilt Lifter draft beer. So good!"}
{"text":"I liked the DJ. He was mixing up some dope beats. I dug the crazy video clips they were playing on the screens. I was sippin $4 Bacardi Mango Fusion #OnPoint 

The bad: Way too many dudes in the bar.   -1 Star"}
{"text":"Gringo Star is a great place for relaxing, watching some Indiana games and enjoying some old school video games and having cocktails with friends.  The service has always been really good.  You could say I am a little bias since I am an IU fan.  They did even go above and beyond when we had our Indiana crowd there and they made some local IU favorites for us.  Plenty of televisions, it is a plus that they have a front bar, back bar and an outside patio."}
{"text":"Came for a late Saturday lunch. The food and service were very good. Standouts were the sweet potato fries and spiced Korean beef. Prices were very reasonable too. Lost one star for being out of two of the six items we ordered!"}
{"text":"Fun place to stop in and have a drink. I loved the fact that they had Deep Eddy's vodka. Good stuff. Tv's to watch and good place to people watch."}
{"text":"Came here on a week night after seeing a picture of the burger.  I have to say it was as good if not better than what it looked like. Definitely the best burger on mill.  Highly recommend going when it's not so packed just to eat and grab some drinks"}
{"text":"After two visits to this place with mixed results, figured it's time for a Yelp review. Both times on a Monday to take advantage of Happy Hour and free games. For a little background, I'm a recent ASU grad, now work in an office on Mill and am generally a fan of Fork & Dagger's other restaurants, including Canteen and Handlebar. 

However, Gringo Star is a big disappointment. 

On our first visit, a couple weeks after they opened, everything went relatively well. The food prices are great for the quantity and quality of the food, and everything we tried on the menu was great - the pork tostada, the chicken drumsticks, the tatertots, and especially the fried okra - which is one of my favorite veggies and hardly ever found on AZ menus. For $2, you get a giant basket of the stuff - it's amazing. 

We sampled some of the specialty cocktails and really enjoyed the maple whiskey sour and another one that had Mountain Dew (sounded gross, but it was awesome!). Our server wasn't great, forgetting to put in half of the tables order at one point, meaning we waited forever to get our food when our friends already had theirs. Since they were relatively new at the time, we figured it probably would just take some time to iron out the kinks. 

I was surprised by how few arcade games they actually had - I've been to similar places back in New York/New Jersey that had way more packed into much less space. Even though this place seems to want to be a \"barcade,\" the focus seems much less on the arcade part. This was made evident by the condition of some of the games - the wait staff hadn't picked up any of the gross old glasses and napkins littering the floor in the arcade area, and when we told our waitress one of the driving games wasn't working, making it impossible to have two-player action, she didn't seem to give a rat's ass. Heaven forbid we actually want to play games on freeplay night, my bad. 

After all that, I did however decide to give it another try and meet a girlfriend after work (5:30 p.m.) at the bar. The bartender said it was her first day on the job, but she seemed nice enough, so we tried to be patient. We had to flag her down for EVERYTHING: water, a happy hour menu, a second time so she could bring us the drink list, then when we ordered our drinks and food. Grrrrr. 

When we ordered our drinks, I was sad to see they took the Mountain Dew cocktail off the menu, but we decided to give the Princess Peach and the Paint Splatter a try, both of which turned out to be pretty tasty. Our bartender admittedly didn't know how to make either of the drinks, and had to wait to find someone else to help her. I understand not having perfected every drink on the menu, but when there's only about 6 or 7 different cocktails on the menu, how about you train your BARTENDERS how to make them? Servers is one thing, but don't put a girl behind the bar that doesn't know how to make anything. 

She then tried to cash us out before our food had even arrived, which I thought was a bit rude. I asked if she had any clue when we might get our food, and she then ran to the kitchen and grabbed us two lukewarm platters - our okra and chicken drumsticks. I got the sinking feeling that it had been sitting back there for a bit since she completely forgot to do any part of her job. 

Despite the fact that the place was pretty empty when we got there, the music was so loud by 6 p.m. (on a MONDAY!) that we couldn't even hear each other talk to have a conversation. We weren't the only ones who thought this was annoying, as the group of guys sitting across from us tried to get the bartender to turn it down. She said she didn't know how, so we all were forced to suffer through deafening noise. 

We didn't stay long, playing only a bit of skeeball before we just couldn't take it any more. I won't be going back to Gringo Star unless I hear some major improvements happen. This place seems way less quality than Fork & Dagger's other joints, and although they might stay in business when school starts up again just by pandering to Fireball-shot demanding bros, but they're majorly effin it up on being a good place to swing into between 5 and 7 on a weeknight."}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed this place in a while despite the fact that I go there reasonably often.  I'm not a night club patron.  I'm a Saturday Afternoon ASU Football patron.  There is no place better...NO PLACE BETTER than Gringo if you want local color, fun and football.  Sit on the patio (its really loud inside)...super easy to see the flat screens.  Very attentive waitresses.  The food is fun...ok this isn't James Beard Award winning fare but it isn't supposed to be...its solid, bar fare with creative flare.  On game day, get there a few hours before game time, get a spot on the patio, order food and drinks and watch the game.  Its a really fun crowd.  I always say, if you can't have fun at Gringo Star, you need to check for a pulse."}
{"text":"5 stars in the BAR CATEGORY.

The food is waaaaaaay above average for a bar. Surprise attack on my belly. All hands on deck! The menu is short and sweet, but tasty.

Many tv's, indoor seating, outdoor seating, sofas, tabletops, barstools, games, 2 bars, etc..

Long Happy Hour from 3pm-9pm.

Customer service was great. Twice I was asked if I needed help finding the restroom. I laughed because I was simply checking out the property....appearing to be lost. I promised one of the gals I would Yelp her. I didn't get her (their) name(s), but here it is.

I've always been a fan of this property, but previous owners keep moving on. I sincerely hope the new owners receive the credit they deserve at Gringo Star Street Bar.

The cherry on top...NINER BAR! I can't talk about the 49ers so soon -- It still hurts. However, I will add this bar to my list of \"away game\" travel destinations. Second to my favorite, 'Typhoon Saloon' in Pacific Beach, San Diego...but MUCH better food.

The end."}
{"text":"Hot girls and hot wings are the two best things about gringo star.  The Mediterranean plate is probably my favorite plate on the menu. Add grilled chicken and you got a meal of champions. Low in calories, high in vitamins and proteins!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome prices, and great service.  If you're here on a Saturday afternoon to watch the games, or on a Friday night to rage and have a blast, this place does it all."}
{"text":"I remember when this place use to be Blondies. It looks way different now. Very cool decor plus the old school video games add a nice touch. 

Nice happy hour. Plus it is a long happy hour. Service was awesome. Marie was super nice and attentive. I was surprised it wasn't busier because of the awesome happy hour. Fried pickles were delicious, You actually get a good portion. They do not offer actual plates so be prepared. It's those paper trays you get at a carnival that holds nachos. Plus you get offered plastic silverware! 

Only the front bar area was open but still had a blast."}
{"text":"Came for a quick afternoon drink and snack! They have about 7 beers on draft and a full bar. We ordered the mozzarella sticks and sweet potato fries. They were super cheap and delicious :). The vibe was nice"}
{"text":"Very unique spot on mill ave! The artwork, atmosphere, and video/arcade games gave the place a great vibe. The menu is kinda random, but I have yet to be disappointed in my selection. My personal favorite so far is definitely their spicy korean beef. 

The staff has always been super friendly, attentive, and laid back. This is the type of place I enjoy going to after a long day of work with some buddies. Not the type of place I would go to grab a quick bite, I always end of staying for a couple hours."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Chicago so I'm no stranger to good food. I saw this place on groupon and wanted to try it out during my visit to AZ. It was fricken awesome to say the least. The vibe was fun and the food was amazing. My friends and I split the bacon burger, Korean BBQ, and a couple other sides. Everything was delicious and I will definitely come back to Tempe just for this place!!"}
{"text":"Do not give this bar your time. Go literally anywhere else. 

I am 23. From Tennessee. Came to Arizona to visit family and friends. They looked at my ID and told me I was not allowed in because my \"ID was against state law.\" Just to let you know, I had gotten into many bars previous to this one because I am of age. The bouncers were unbelievably rude. They asked for a 2nd form of ID...I gave them my credit cards, a concealed carry license (another picture ID), my health insurance card, literally every card in my wallet. They said \"yeah I don't know it's just against state law.\" We immediately went to another bar and they immediately let me in because...I'm 23. 

These people are either morons or racist (I'm Filipino). I'll let you be the judge. But seriously, don't go."}
{"text":"This is one of the best college hangouts and place to watch sporting events. They even have vintage video games for people to play!! Great service and music"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Really fun crowd. Had fun for ASU game days. Benny Benassi was unreal there... Highly recommend"}
{"text":"this place was a fun,  cheap food, cheap drinks,  fun games.   unfortunately we had to leave because our friend was denied entry.   he committed the blasphemous sin of wearing so called ''athletic sandals'' instead of flip flops.  at least,  that's the distinction the bouncer made sure to make so that we understood clearly his rational for standing his ground against the evil athletic sandals.  i'm just thankful my friend wasn't arrested for such offensive behavior.   i mean,  footwear is a number one priority in 100 degree heat.  so just make sure to call ahead and send several snap shots of your foot apparel over for approval before trying to play skeeball.   they don't play here.  oh,  and be sure not to close the door to the patio.   you'll be looked out and the bros on their cellphones will be too cool to hear you banging o the door for help."}
{"text":"Never again will I be coming here.I had 2 unfortunate visits and they were both equally painful.First off the bouncers are tools and they all look as if they were suffering from severe constipation. I should be glad that they're working security instead of an occupation that requires intelligences. I was wearing my hat in a normal fashion and they found it to be out of \"regulations\" so they made me pull down my hat until the brim was touching my eyebrows.Of course, I adjusted my hat to my preferred setting as soon as I got in.Second off the bartender was off in her own world and was very rude because I requested a beer while she was in deep conversation.Don't worry darling your \"guy\" won't be walking off anytime soon, it seems that he's been drinking heavily and has trouble standing up.Third off, the demographic of people here,Holy geez! some of the most self centered, self entitled group of people I've ever dealt with.I wandered off into someones booth on accident to take a seat and some girl flips out on me like I broke something.Settle down woman, it's 130am there is 30mins left before this place closes. I think the party has already surpassed it's peak.So all this cussing,yelling and name calling is not necessary.As for the second trip? You don't want to know."}
{"text":"One of my faves on mill. Super cool atmosphere. Great staff. Awesome djs. Stephen & Hartley are great managers and always make sure everyone is taken care of and having a blast. Most fun spot during ASU football games. Probably more fun than being at the games themselves."}
{"text":"Worst service, worst food ever, I'm a culinary school graduate and I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Fun place. Been here a few times with friends. The arcade in the back is a really cool touch and gets busy on the weekends. Fun bar, cold beer, cool crowd."}
{"text":"So far it's been a great experience, adult beverages on the way! Fried pickles you guessed it, just ordered and can't wait. Best deal yet, no chipmunks found here either, lol, we are all safe. Btw. I have great girl that is enjoying this incredible atmosphere too. Come check it out!
Our sever is super nice and keeping an eye for a pesky chipmunk, she appeased me! Great staff and so far a good time, can't wait for the food!"}
{"text":"Overall, the bar is ok. The arcade theme is cool and the staff is friendly, but I cannot be the only one who cannot stand the smell! Among my friend group, I rarely propose going to Gringo Star because I cannot stand the smell of this place. I was there last night and it smelled like sewage was just hanging out in the entrance area. When it doesn't smell like sewage, it smells like bleach. It's such a cool bar! Why???"}
{"text":"First time here this past sunday 12-17-13 was looking for a nice place to watch the niners game. Me and my buddy eric came down sat at the back bar, service started out good but buy the 4th quarter of the game couldn't get a beer to save my life. Will say food is good when it does come. Not sure if ill be back...."}
{"text":"Nice decor, decent service, crappy arcade games. I can't really figure out what this bar is trying to be but it isn't fun or cool. I guess it's cheap, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"I've been to Gringo a few times after ASU games and can honestly say it's one of my fav bars on Mill. They have fairly reasonable drink specials and while I haven't tried the food yet, it looks to be pretty bomb. I also love the fact that they have arcade games and N64 consoles around the bar to challenge some friends while enjoying your drinks. I will definitely be back to Gringo Star many times to come!"}
{"text":"They don't let people with face or neck tattoos in which is DISCRIMINATION This isn't a simple dress code issue which can be  enforced Your tattoos are your life decision that aren't an accessory that can't thrown on and off The management and owners are a lawsuit waiting to happen and I'll be glad when it does"}
{"text":"I came in here for dinner on Monday August 24th and was told to leave when i told the bartender i was not gonna drink. getting plastered out of my mind with Booze is not my style. Meaning im not the getting drunk type to be more specific. i was walking down Mill Ave and seen the sign about a food special a quarter pound burger with tater tots 6.99 or something. places that serve tater tots are hard to find in the phoenix area so when i seen that sign i wanted to take advantage of it. but that came to a hault real quick when i was told to leave cause i said i wasn't gonna drink. is that a reason to run me out of there when i was still gonna give them business just not at the bar???? let me know your thoughts."}
{"text":"I haven't even gotten my food yet and I'm already entirely over this place. 

We were captivated when we came in because there are awesome old school video games and that is my JAM. We checked out the happy hour menu and picked out what we wanted. I asked for water and a mule, my cousins husband asked for an IPA. I got my mule only (no water) and he got a Kilt Lifter. My cousin at that time ordered a Hefeweizen.... And was brought a Heineken... So that happened...

I'm going to take this time to mention the bar tenders attire: a crop top sweater, jeans, and a beanie. Now, I'm new to Arizona, but if you're cold, I'm pretty sure you can wear a full sweater. Not a half-sweater and a hat. 

Anyways- the happy hour menu says we get free chips and salsa with a drink order. We have asked for our chips and salsa twice and still haven't received it... She said it would be out soon... But it's chips and salsa. I know y'all aren't hand cutting your tortillas back there and making fresh salsa in a Vitamix. Come on. 

To top it all off, it smells like a bathroom in here. You'll know what I mean if you ever decide to ruin your life and come here. 

Will update if/when our food arrives.

{"text":"Man, everybody on this page keeps pointing out the douchey nature of the bar, the mediocre drinks, and the basic food.

Y'all need to reassess the priorities here. It is all about the old school arcade games! We stumbled upon here after getting some Fat Tuesdays and feelin' all juiced up. While intending to stay for a drink, we immediately gravitated to the loud archaic games that were lying in the back of the bar.

Needless to say, I felt like a ten year old again.

Pac-man, Ultimate Mortal Kombat, random shooter games... all free?! (minus the Simpsons game which costed a quarter or something)

I was living life again through my free play barcade sensation. I can't say if the other \"important\" parts of the establishment were on point (i.e. food and drinks), but for the games scene, I was thrilled to see the ability to play back just one more time. Who says grow ups can't play games anymore?"}
{"text":"We were looking for something different and strolled by Gringo's. What a stroke of luck! It's big for night life, but has really good burgers and dogs during the day too. Full bar, and great staff! I'll go there again next time I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"You'd think this was a cheap imitation dive bar, but it's so much more.
My friend and I went it for a beer and something small. We had a wonderful taste treat. 
They have a unique selection of eats that will please any one wanting something different.
 I had the Cubano Sandwich. It was good, but then turned Great after they brought the fried pickles they forgot.
Try something different here. You'll be happy."}
{"text":"We were so happy to see this place and give it a try.. We went without checking Yelp and now that I have I see several others have had similar experiences.. Fisrt off the food was good--not great --but good.  We sat outside and it took 3 tripsin over almost 25 minutes to get a waitress.. She came out finallt and took our order but ignores the dirty table in from of us.. When we asked for a rag to clean the table she brought one and then started to hand it to us to wipe off the table.. The look n my face probably frightened her and she decided to do it.  There were 3 of us and only one ever received a drink refill.  They were just iced tea and soda.. Two people ordered wings and one a burger.  No napkins.  Had to ask again.  Pretty much that trend continued  through out our time there and so to sum up--Food is OK--Service is VERY bad and they werent even busy.  Probably make another choice from now on and will say thats disappointing.. Had high hopes."}
{"text":"Honestly you can't go wrong with any bar that serves you a drink with a bendy straw. I mean seriously why doesn't every bar do this?!

My boo, friend and I stumbled upon this place while venturing around the downtown Tempe area. They have some super cheap happy hour specials and a great atmosphere. There's some old a arcade games in the back and plenty of TVs around the bar. The bartenders were super friendly and attentive which is always a great thing. Really you just can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"We have been sitting, waiting for food and beverage service for at least 15 minutes.  We have even gone up to the bar asking for service to our table with no luck.  Pretty ridiculously poor service for a bar right on Mill."}
{"text":"Cool place with a good dj on the weekends. The bar gets crowded at times but it's bearable. I think the worst thing about the place are the bouncers, especially the one with a faux hawk, he eyes you like a hawk to see what you're wearing, I mean come on this is mill after all, not vegas or scottsdale, even then. I've seen people get dress coded like no other at this place.  I'm not sure if you have to have a certain look to come here or they don't want certain people in their bar but they will try to dress code you or someone in your group for the dumbest little things."}
{"text":"I came around 3pm for happy hour, got the bacon burger, the shredded beef, n the fries.  Burger was good, not the best but good.  Shredded beef was good but I couldnt finish the bread. Kinda dry but not bad at all.  Fries were covered with cheese,  mmmm.  Sexy lookin bartenders, friendly n cute.  Free arcade style video games, fun.  Casual atmosphere, nothing fancy.  Music good.  Cool place to grab a drink n some apps.  Bye Felicia!"}
{"text":"Another example of the fun and dynamic bars that keep Mill Ave a prime nightlife destination. 

This place is cool! Like, hella cool! I can not think of a bad time to show up, as it will be awesome either way. 

During they day, they've got an amazing happy hour from 3-9. This includes the basics, like incredibly inexpensive Bud Light drafts. But also some better beers, mixed beverages, and some appetizers for no more than $6. These are all steals. 

They have other specials late at night as well, making it a very attractive option compared to the competition. 

There's a typical sports bar area with plenty of TVs. A couple of these tables have old-school gaming consoles. I would be more than happy to lose friends over a game of Mario Kart 64. =) 

Down the hallway, there's a row of arcade games, most of which are free. Nothing too unique in selection, but all classics. And they're not all basketball games, either. You can shoot some hoops, too! You know the arcade game I'm talking about, right? 

Further down the hall is ample seating, so you can spend plenty of time socializing as opposed to just playing games. I've slept on Gringo Star for far too long, and look forward to seeing it at its most lively."}
{"text":"Bouncer went totally insane, stole my ID and started yelling at me saying he was going to call the cops and get me arrested if I didn't walk away. I will definitely tell everyone I know to never come here unless they want to go to the DMV to get a new ID the next day. I should have called the cops for theft - these people are batshit crazy."}
{"text":"We had some friends in from out of town and wanted to give them the \"Mill\" experience. There were 8 of us all together and this bar was our first stop of the night. I wish I could say more about the place, but we actually never went in. The guy at the door was so rude we decided to leave. He was belittling us to the point we thought he was joking, until we realized he wasn't.  With the quick turnover of Mill bars I would think customer service would be a top priority, but to this place, it obviously isn't. I am happy to spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"My publisher and I stopped here for a quick bite and I had the pesto margarita pizza and ate 1/2 of it and have to say it was amazing I love pesto and cheese so that is hard to screw up, great service too- the sandwich Joe ordered is the one I was eyeballing but knew it would be soggy when I brought what I couldn't eat home for my late night snack- Joe had the ultimate Chicken club which was so yummy that I am craving it now.
Nice bartender, hip place and if you want to watch a football game they definitely are the place to go, or any sports for that matter - prices were decent for Mill ave and I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"I came to Tempe for a \"business trip\"  and this place has been amazing, cheap beers and an amazing atmosphere have been amazing.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst bars ive ever been to in my life. The bar tenders were rude, and the service was terrible. The bar let way too many people in as well so it was shoulder to shoulder and it took almost 10 minutes to walk to the other side of the bar. I love me some loud music and having a good time but how are you supposed to have a good time when you are squished to sardines and everyeone is all sweaty? The music would be cool if it was a dance club but i couldnt even hear my friend who was a foot away whien we were outside on the patio bar. Wouldnt recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great happy hour every day, fun place to play some old arcade games. Also has a decent amount of TVs to watch games on. The service was less than spectacular, waited for a while to be approached. The food tasted like typical overly fried bar food, and was a little over priced."}
{"text":"Gringo is a great Mill Ave nightlife and daytime spot! 

I've been here at both times of the day, mostly for IU Hoosiers watch parties. If you can't tell by the crimson Indiana flag flown outside the entrance, it's a mainstay for Hoosier alumni/fan game meetups. They take really good care of us from when there's only a handful of us all the way to an overflow for a March Madness game. 

Outside of the game meetups it's pretty poppin too- a DJ pretty much spins every night (sometimes even during the day too). 

The drinks are pretty decent especially green tea shots and the $10 beer pitcher specials (warning:: none of the \"special\" beers like Shock Top you can get for $10). The food is nothing too special- the chips and dip are pretty gross above everything. It's either the stale chips or weirdly spicy salsa, take your pick. I do appreciate their attempts at stuffed pizza breadsticks on the menu (something particular to IU), those are good for the price."}
{"text":"So this place is packed with ninner fans on Sundays (no I am not one of them) they have $2 budlights which was nice for me budget, the food is all street style and was very good. Buuuuut the service was by far the worst I've ever,had! tracking down someone to take your order for drinks or food is not as easy as you'd think. By the time we found \"veronica\" we were starving and thirsty. She was very inattentive and we were literally yelling and waving our hands to get her attention, she had no personality and when we told her we were tired of yelling for her she just nodded, no apology what so ever! By the time we got our bill I realized why, they add tip to every bill on Sundays no matter what. So hey why be a nice friendly server when your gguaranted tip anyways right? Only came bbecause of a groupon iI bought, but I def won't be back, she ruined it for us."}
{"text":"The bar tender hartly was awesome I have been here before but the service tonight was great"}
{"text":"Five stars for food and bartender service. The street tacos were awesome and the plate was only $10 and delicious. The bartender Cory was also awesome. He recommended the tacos. There was an unruly patron that he gently tried to make right, when that failed, he firmly and professionally guided him out the door.  His customer service was outstanding all afternoon"}
{"text":"I visited the Gringo as a part of an alumni gathering of the fans of the opposing school at an ASU football game. Nice bar here. Cold beer, great wings. Good prices on domestic drafts. I loved the 80's era arcade games: Galaga!

BTW: ASU fans are cool."}
{"text":"I've been here twice before for late night partying and both times it was awesome energy and good vibes.  I finally made it in for lunch last Wednesday because I keep hearing they have awesome food.  
I have now officially found my new favorite burger spot!!!!  I had the Smashed Burger with pickles and I think it even had thousand island dressing.  It was really frigen good and my bartender was super nice too.  
I highly recommend this spot for the food as well as the partying.  
My only complaint is that I had trouble finding a place to park..."}
{"text":"I went there recently to try it and used a Groupon for a 50% discount. The food is strictly meant for drunk people. If you go there expecting high quality or interesting food, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one place where I can sit and not have to worry about what I want to drink. The staff, especially kennedy and julia are amazing. They make Amazing cocktails. The best part is their long happy hours with the cheapest beers in town and free chips and salsa. Definitely ask julia to make the colorado bulldog!!"}
{"text":"A Sexy-saxman cover guy came out once during a football game during half-time playing a saxophone it was phenomenal. 

Then during the WM Open they opened up at like 7am and drove us on a party bus with a lot of kids trying to be bourgie (...but we know you're from Mill) to the open. It was great. We were allowed to bring our own drinks for the bus and even though we didn't originally have tickets for the bus they made some room and popped us on the bus.

So I'm going to say this place offers a lot more than the other bars than discounted cheap drinks."}
{"text":"I am pretty surprised by the reviews of this place because my fiance and I loved it. 

I loved the trendy look inside. The bar was the perfect place to watch the SEC Championship. We had a few kind people sitting next to us and struck up a conversation a couple times. The food was pretty good. The taps (for beer) were down when we went in, but my fiance got an IPA and loved it. 

The bartender was very attentive and nice! 

The only things that were downsides were...1. the food came out pretty slowly. 2. The bathrooms weren't that clean, but then again we were in a bar. 

We will definitely come back and recommend."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place doesn't get good reviews.  I went out here for a night out in Mill with some friends and I had a lot of fun.  This place attracts a very friendly crowd of college kids and young professionals.  What more can you ask for a scene?  You can dance anywhere you like, it's a NINERS bar (I think), and it's a huge venue that's got everything you need in a bar."}
{"text":"Place is fun to go if you want to do some day drinking, at nights meh. Watched the US game vs Portugal and one of the bartenders handed everyone sitting at the bar a free round of beers which was most excellent. Other times during the day I have enjoyed myself with friends drinking and playing games. At night it just turns into the standard over packed, loud, and slow service bars. I still enjoy stopping in right around 9 to get drinks then head else where."}
{"text":"So, I waited two days to write this. My husband and I went to grab a quick beer. It was afternoon time and only one other couple was there. We were sitting at the bar and I went to put my drink back down and ON MY NAPKIN there was a German cockroach!! I flew out of my seat so fast. Gross! My husband killed 4 of them at the bar and we still got charged for our food. The manager came out, didn't even address us and tried to hide it all. The bartender was grossed out and mortified- she had no idea how to handle the situation. Don't go here. This place shouldn't even be allowed to be open."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! It's everything you need in a bar: great people, friendly staff, management that looks after their customers. Best college bar on Mill hands down"}
{"text":"So I went to this place because I loved the idea of playing video games at a bar!  That part did live up to it's potential.  I mean, how could it not?!  Mario Kart + beer = fun. 

The two of us ordered food, lettuce wraps and a bbq sandiwch.  The lettuce wraps they put the \"meaty\" stuff on top of the lettuce making it a mess if you actually wanted to WRAP it.  The \"meaty\" stuff was actually pretty good, I just wanted to be able to eat it how a wrap is typically eaten.....wrapped up.  The bbq my boyfriend liked so that was a plus. 

The service however was awful.  When the waitress took our order we didn't get out that we wanted ice waters and fries before she walked away.  I was left in mid sentence and dying for water in the desert.  With that said, the whole night they had the door open.  It was 105* -_- Misery.

We had two other friends meet us and that's when we started wanting shots and more drinks.  The shots we eventually got tired of waiting to order so we went to the bar and waited 15min for the guy to put together a crappy rendition of a lemon drop and some straight patron shots.  Then the waitress never came back to our stack of empty drinks to ask if we needed/wanted more.  I can only assume she was only so unattentive  because her 4 friends were at the table behind us...nice.  She ended her shift and passed us on to the next available waitress who was equally unattentive.  We ended up using the bartender for everything more than any of the waitress'.  The last group of shots we ordered the bar tender yelled them to the waitress to add them to our tab.  Not 5min later she comes over with another round thinking we were ordering them.  Great communication. We of course took them with a smile and went on our merry way.

Lastly, if you want to be able to communicate with other people at the table you will want to make sure you leave before 10PM.  It will soon turn into douchville USA with louder music and less people.  

Great idea, unfortunately poorly executed.  My hope is they work on their customer service and things can only go up from there!"}
{"text":"Great place for college students. The place to be if you like beer, music and video games."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I went for my birthday YES MY BIRTHDAY.. I wore Jordan's because it was MY BIRTHDAY... Security guard said  and I quote, \"sorry people with high top shoes and or Jordan's not allowed\"... Me: \"why\" .. Security guard: \"problems people cause problems\"...

Guys please copy and paste this and post it every social media you know about... Lets bring these guys down like we did the big bang.   NO JUSTICE NO PEACE.. African Americans with Jordans.. Latinos stand up and let's bring this place down..."}
{"text":"Always fun times at Gringo. Best place for Arizona State football pregames. Perfect location on Mill, fun music, plus there's ARCADE GAMES, so duh. Bottle service without the crazy pricing and full size kegs. Do a keg stand, I dare you."}
