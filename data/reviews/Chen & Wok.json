{"text":"I discovered this place by accident about 3 years ago..  Their price is very reasonable.  The food is excellent.  My favorite is \"Yui Shan Spicy Pork\" & \"House Special Chow Mein\".   Once my family was hooked on these, we drive 20 miles just to have it for dinner.      I like them serving in Chinese take-out containers even when I order to eat in the premise.   The food stays HOT until I finish the meals in the container.  This makes the food lot more tastier.    It's good idea.   Good taste Chinese foods with good service and good price.  It's the BEST!!

{"text":"Very tasty! Flavorful and lots of food for your $$! Delicious cashew chicken and crab puffs! Right around the corner from my work, I will be going here again!

Also, it looks dirty from the outside, but surprisingly remodeled on the inside! 

Just try it!"}
{"text":"Wow - I tried ordering  delivery from this place.  I was relunctant because of the mixed reviews.  The lady on the phone was so rude I hung up.  She could barely understand english and refused to take my order without knowing a cross street.  I am visiting and don't know this area but the place is only a couple miles away.  She then put me on hold and I heard her complaining about me because I didn't know the cross street.
Ruined my night and put me in a bad mood.  Don't go here - they don't know how to treat their customers!!!!"}
{"text":"Super fast and super friendly!  Whenever I'm craving some good take-out Chinese food, this is the place to go.  They have great prices and you get a decent amount of food for the money.  The owners are very personable, he even brought each of my kids a toy when delivering to my house once.  We've tried other Chinese food places in the Surprise area, and have found Chen & Wok to be one of the best."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. I'll drive 20 miles round trip for their sweet and sour pork. They are friendly and quick. Only had one so do experience here and it was because I'm not a huge curry fan and tried the curry.  My fault. Great place. They could clean better, but that seems par for Chinese food places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Always ordered Chinese food twice a week from Chen Wok their food and portion is absolutely excellent I ordered from Shamrock last night lemon chicken white meat to egg rolls house fried rice two orders of orange chicken used to pay $38 for dinner last night it was 52 dollars since prop 206 came in place which I voted for they've raised their prices from a 1. 85 - $2.85 - $3.15 depending what you order I love Chen Wok but that's way overpriced maybe every other month I'll order but it ain't going to be for dinner it's just going to be for one egg roll because I will not pay those prices they're gouching people on their prices because of prop 206.Used to 5 star but the way they raised the prices I will give them 2 stars and star looking for another Chinese restaurant"}
{"text":"Order food for delivery the other night, never tried them before and they're pretty close by. The delivery was pretty fast (may be due to living a few blocks away). The portions were plenty (think I may not realized how much I was ordering, LOL). I tried the szechuan beef, house fried rice, house chop suey, and pot stickers. Had plenty and had plenty of leftovers.

The food was really tasty and good. My only criticism is that the food doesn't really stand out, although a lot of those chinese takeout/etc. places run together. It feels like I can get the same food anywhere else. But the quality is still really good IMO, so I would say consistent. Very convenient and really close by. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Best lunch spot ever. I have been eating here consistently since 04. You get a big bowl of food for a great price. I encourage all to try"}
{"text":"Chicken n broccoli tasted like it was just doused in soy sauce. Everything else was mediocre at best. Poor customer service. They took order down incorrectly (probably bc they were also taking phone calls during my order) and acted like it was my fault. I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chinese food in Phoenix!  Their lo mein is the best I've had in this area. I tried the Kung Pao Beef last time and it was really good, just not actually kung pao style, and it had no vegetables at all. The meats are good and the portions are huge for the price."}
{"text":"Ordered from them at 6:04 p.m. for delivery...at 6:52 p.m. no food...called the store to find out where our orer was and was rudely told, \"I don't know, it's not here, so it must be on it's way\"...7:23 p.m. no food...called to cancel order, and while on the phone with them the delivery guy shows up...I agree to pay, but no tip...get our food, and start going throug the bag and noticed some extra items...fried wontons and spring rolls...maybe free because they were late?...nope...there was a knock on the door...delivery guy gave us the wrong bag...got our food finally and it sucked...worst lo mein ever...will never order from Chen Wok again...oh, and sorry to the people who's food I fingered for them..."}
{"text":"Today was the first and last time I'll eat here. The staff is friendly enough but the food is horrible. Within the first bite of their steamed rice and of their cashew shrimp I had to spit it out and throw the remainders away. The portions were decent enough but the taste; no. 

The egg rolls were tasty but very, very small. The last item we tried was the crab puffs which were tasty. Sorry, I will not be coming here again though."}
{"text":"If you eat there it's ok but don't order take out! I ordered Orange chicken and the chicken was so dry. The plate was so hot that it made a whole at the bottom of the plate and all the sauce leaked out. It happens all the time!"}
{"text":"Let's make this short if you want bad food and to be nickeled and dimed to get a shred of  vegetables at 50cents each this is the place to go. If not move on I have. Look at the pictures on the wall of the food that is the only time you will see it look anything like that. If you want Kung Pao 2 you get nothing but the meat and an overload of sauteed onion, not a nut or chili to be found. The egg drop soup was so watered down it was clear and tasteless. This is long enough."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best bang for your buck! My go to is the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice.  I have never been disappointed in the food.  Some of the women at the register are not so friendly but I believe its a cultural thing.  Dont pass up this gem!"}
{"text":"Take out: Lots of rice in the take out and a good pile of the main course too. Quality isn't top notch, but they are trying to give lots of food for the price, geared for family dining on the cheap. ie.  Plenty of celery and onions... 

For another dollar or two a plate you can do better. And the shame is so could they, but I'm sure they know what their clients want. Quantity over quality."}
{"text":"I placed an order for pick up. While waiting for the lady to get off the phone, so I can pay n leave.. I saw something fall from the ceiling, I looked on the floor to see what fell...OMG, it was a cockroach!! No joke!! I literally turned around and walked out, and left the food behind! No thanks. Plus I'm reporting to the USDA."}
{"text":"Average chinese place, nothing special. Very cheap lunch specials, no room to sit in so you have to pick up. They charge an absurd delivery fee so its really not a viable option.(like 2-3$plus tip) minimum order 15 plus the fee"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Since moving back to Arizona, it's the only Asian food we've ordered. Their delivery time is average 45 mins to an hour which is quite the wait. Well worth it though. Prices are reasonable for the insane amount of food they give you. On average, a family of 4 can eat for about $23. Again, well worth it since driving to a drive thru costs about the same and uses gas money. The lemon chicken is amazing as well as the crab ragoons. Always get the lo mein because it's one of a kind. Truly delicious! Oh, the delivery drivers are great as well! One man in particular (older Asian) makes me laugh and smile every time. He remembers me, even if it's been over a month since the previous order. He bows and is extremely grateful for the $5 tip he gets. I give more if I can afford it, simply because he's such a pleasure to do business with. Food is always hot & fresh, I love this place!"}
{"text":"I've had great meals here and so so meals too. it depends on the day of the week I guess. We get the hunan chicken-its not on the menu but its always good. their lo-mein is always good and the portions are huge. We always split their dinner specials. its reasonably priced, close by and quick. There are definitely better Chinese restaurants in the valley, but it is surprise and not exactly the height of food in the valley"}
{"text":"I love this place! I work nearby and have been coming here frequently for lunch. The lunch specials are very reasonably priced and the portions are good sized.

Everything I have tried so far has had great flavor. My current favorite is the Spicy Beef.  The dark sauce is rich and spicy,  with a little sweetness. It was so good,  it in fact prompted this review!  The Kung Pao Chicken and Curry Chicken are also very good. I do wish the veggies in the Curry Chicken were a little softer,  but the flavor is so yummy I don't mind too much. I should probably note that I order everything *extra spicy*. 

I have never had anything that was greasy,  but I prefer the dishes were the chicken is not breaded and fried. 

I ordered my lunch with the Lo Mien today, and I did not like it as much as the rice. Both the white rice and fried rice are good.

The service is also great.  The only time they forgot to include something (an eggroll), I called and they offered 2 free with the next order and took my name down. When I placed my next order they remembered and honored the offer without hesitation. They also personally apologized for the mistake.  Very courteous and a great example of customer service. 

This place isn't fancy,  but for what it is - cheap, fast, and flavorful,  it is definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"I have tried Chen Wok a few times... I think I kept hoping the food would get better since they deliver. It hasn't gotten any better, and I've finally given up. We had orange chicken and cashew chicken with fried rice last time. Everything was bad. They delivered quickly and were friendly... If only the food were appetizing :("}
{"text":"Normally these little hole-in-the-wall chinese restaurants have great food. Not this place. Every thing I've ordered from this restaurant has been so greasy they had to put the leaking container in a plastic bag. That is just too greasy.

In terms of decor, I don't think this is the kind of chinese place you sit down and eat at, it's definitely more of a to go restaurant. 

The price is average and you do get a decent amount of food for the money. It's just a shame that their food isn't that great."}
{"text":"Don't you hate when you get a craving for something and it you can't get it out of your mind until you finally give in to it? Well that is how I found Chen & Wok! I had been thinking about fried rice for days, and yesterday I decided I better just give in and get some instead of driving myself crazy! 

Chen & Wok is near my office, and I decided that it would be the place that I would get my fried rice fix. I am always a bit apprehensive going into new places that could be considered questionable from the outside, but it was surprising clean and bright inside. I liked the fact that you just order at the counter...and my food took less than five minutes! 

They have some really cheap lunch specials, but none of them were for fried rice, so I had to \"splurge\" and pay $5.95 for my shrimp fried rice and I also got a side of crab won-tons, which are usually my litmus test for good Chinese. 

When I opened the container of rice, it was packed in so tight it came overflowing out of the little carton, it easily could be 3 - 4 meals, so my \"splurge\" was well worth it! The rice was love at first bite! It was the prefect fried rice with bits of eggs and green onions mixed in with the plump shrimp (and these were big shrimp, not those wimpy salad shrimp), and it wasn't greasy at all...just what I needed to feed my craving! Next I tried the crab puffs, which were shaped like little purses rather than the triangles I usually see, and wow...just wow....they actually had a lot of crab and cream cheese in them...and they were perfectly crisp and oh so tasty when dunked in the sweet and sour sauce! The order came with 8 large puffs for just $3.95....what a steal! 

I will definitely be back to try some of their other offerings, while waiting I spied someones Lo Mein which also looked quite tasty...and the prices will be perfect for my after Christmas budget! The only downside I can see so far is the absence of Sesame Chicken on the menu....but I guess I will just be forced to try something new!"}
{"text":"When C&W first opened, it was okay.  It was also the only game in town for about a year, so we sucked it up, ordered our lo mein, and were thankful that it wasn't Panda Express crap.  But as others have noted, the increasing amount of not-so-tasty oil used in every single dish is a big turn-off.  It's cheap and it tastes like it.  

The last 3 times we've ordered from them for take-out, we've had mistakes in our order.  Not, \"We gave you someone else's food, oops, my bad,\" but mistakes like ordering family style tofu and being sent home with tofu soup.  Or asking for a large fried rice and small steamed rice -- and getting a large steamed and small fried.  That sort of thing.  To their credit, they've been great about fixing such screw-ups, but it gets old.

We now don't eat there at all, even though it's much closer than our preferred Big Buddha."}
{"text":"The last time I was at Chen & Wok I realized that because I always come for takeout, I had never checked in here! This is criminal, because, as I was thinking to myself at the time: \"I absolutely LOVE this place!\" I determined to write a review.

So the wife and I, we like takeout Chinese. We've moved four times around CenPho since we've been together - and each neighborhood we go to we struggle to find our Go-To Chinese Takeout Joint. Prior to being where we are now, this title was taken by Autumn Court and later, Siu Wok. Now, it's Chen & Wok all the way, baby.

Chen & Wok hits all the right notes for American Takeout Chinese. Their ingredients are of a medium quality with an eye to being economical - but it is so well prepared and the portions are so generous that it doesn't matter. Their sweet and sour chicken is the perfect example of a food cliche done right. Equal parts sweet and sour and appropriately neon red. The chicken is dark meat, cheaper but more moist and a perfect fit for Asian flavors. Their hot and sour soup is neither particularly hot nor sour (one of my recurring pet peeves with Chinese takeout) - but a couple dashes of Tabasco and it is PERFECT. I've never had hot and sour soup that I enjoyed quite so much. Their vegetable lo mein made a true believer out of me - try it, you'll be shocked at how good it is.

Another thing I love about Chen & Wok: every time I call, they tell me it will be done in 10 or 15 minutes, and it ALWAYS is.

So why four stars? Well, it seems Chen & Wok, in knocking the cliches out of the ballpark, can also not escape the negative ones. Employees whose grasp of the language is questionable at best (and who most certainly should NOT be answering the phone). Dingy and spartan dine-in facilities. Absolutely crappy delivery service. Seriously, I don't even bother with it anymore, I just go get it myself. These are all common to AmChi joints and you'll also find them here.

But if you crave that certain something that you get in the best takeout Chinese, this place is a safe bet. I'll post some photos of the food when I get a chance."}
{"text":"I don't know why so many people give bad reviews to Chen Wok. It's one of my favorite chinese places in Surprise and has been for years. They have a large variety of food and huge portions! I have literally never been disappointed with my order from here. Plus, they deliver. Who doesn't love that?"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews my husband and I were up to trying Chen & Wok.  Unfortunately we left over 3/4 of our food in the trash.

We had Egg Flour soup, Crab Puffs and Chicken with Broccoli.  The soup had almost a chemical taste to it...and the crab puffs were 99% creme cheese with scallion, no crab.  At first I was hopeful when tasting the chicken with broccoli, until my second bite was ALL grissley-crunch and it wasn't the broccoli.  

We ate over lunch and spent about $13.50.  I now wish I had twice that amount back because I was not able to finish my afternoon...I'm home with a terrible stomach ache."}
{"text":"My co-worker has Chen & Wok almost once a week and she simply raves about the place. Literally right across the street from my office, I decided to try it one afternoon. I order the #16 Terriaki Chicken. It was SUPER CHEAP. Like $4.25 or something for the medium which had a ton of rice and decent cuts of chicken. The place itself is kind of small and run down but Asain restaurants aren't known for their perfect establishments

The chicken was good, it cut into really big chunks though. Made it a little difficult to cut and mix with the sauce and rice. The chicken was grilled nicely with a few burnt, crunchy mixes there too. I reccommend this piece if you're pressed for time and want something super cheap."}
{"text":"Best shrimp fried rice I've ever had. House lo mein is good, but I've had better. Staff is friendly. It's one of my top 3 Chinese-hole -in-the-wall restaurants."}
{"text":"Best crab puffs EVER!!!  I have been going to this location for years and they still rock.  The orange chicken is sometimes not as good as it normally is but their fried rice, lo mein and other main dishes are always top notch."}
{"text":"I love the food and the fried shrimp is especially good. The delivery drivers are nice as well."}
{"text":"This place is really good (and really cheap).  The food is a bit greasy and the place is a bit dirty, but you can count on good food and huge portions.  Order the lunch specials and you'll spend like $4 on a huge bowl of food.  I highly suggest the house chicken.  One of my favorites."}
{"text":"I love this place! The fastest delivery I've ever had. Tonight's meal was delivered in 16 minutes! They have the most incredible large portion of crab puffs. The Hunan Beef is not chewy and has more beef than vegetables which is refreshing. The House Chicken is my husband's favorite and always a good cut of chicken. My order has always been accurate and steaming hot. This is not only the best delivery but the best Chinese I have had in years. This is a MUST try."}
{"text":"I picked up my dinner tonight and was thoroughly disappointed in the entire meal when I got home.  The portions are ridiculously large and my Almond Chicken tasted like it had medicine in it.  The rice was not hot and totally sticky (mushy).  I think it was  steam table food.  I ate a few bites and threw the entire order in the trash.  

I would prefer to get less food with good flavor then a pile of bad food!"}
{"text":"Ok first of all. This is a \"fast food\" style American Chinese food. This is not a fancy place where you need to dress up to match the decor. I have been to different Chinese restaurants here in Phoenix. I lived in LA for more than 17 years before I moved to Phoenix. Speaking of Chinese food as a Chinese American (born and raised in Hong Kong), I do not have much to complain about this place for what I paid for. I have been spoiled with real good authentic Chinese food in Hong Kong and even in LA. This mom and pop joint pricing is very reasonable in terms of their lunch menu. Huge portion with good price. It is better than going to American fast food joints. They cook the food right there. In Hong Kong, we always talk about \"wok hey\" when it comes to cooked food. I think this place is totally provide a decent food for the price. I love their curry. This type of food reminds me when I was little and sat at the outdoor patio of some of the ghetto restaurants with some amazing food in Hong Kong. Nothing about eating healthy here. So if you are one of those who want healthy food, this is not the place because you will taste greasy food.

I see a mix of reviews here. I noticed there were at times I did not get good cooked steamed rice. I am extremely picky on rice at any Asian restaurants. Yes the rice can get either too dried or too soggy at times. But it can be forgiven only because I only paid little over $5!!! Whatever main ingredients were well cooked and tasted good. And they are quick on orders too which is amazing. They are not like Panda Express Corporate that provide food sitting in the warming containers and serve you however numbers of items. In fact, it costs more at Panda Express! I think the mix reviews can be due to the chef on duty that day and the time when you ordered. Like today at lunch I ordered my curry chicken again. And this is the best by far. The ones I had before were okay."}
{"text":"Probably the 2nd best Chinese food in Surprise. I much prefer Big Buddha on Greenway and the 303, however this is much closer to my house so occasionally I will find myself stopping in. It is the definition of mediocore Chinese food. Pro-tip Don't order anything fried."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food!  Not sure why this place gets negative reviews.  It is my go to when I am craving Chinese food."}
{"text":"MAGGOTS!!!! I wish I could leave a -5 rating on here for Chen & Wok; we have eaten takeout for here for years and always enjoyed it for our greasy Chinese fix. But last night we found fu¢king MAGGOT in our broccoli. We took it back, got our money and raised a huge stink...other diners also came up to get their money back. That is by far the MOST disgusting experience I've ever had from eating out and I worked in food service for years so I've seen some pretty nasty things. NEVER EVER EAT HERE!!!! I will be calling the health department on Monday. I couldn't believe the girl said, \"Well it was probably just something from the vegetables but I'll give you your money back anyway.\" Seriously?! It's a fu¢king MAGGOT!!!! So for anyone considering enjoying good ole Chen & Wok, let me say it again....MAGGOTS!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"House Chop Suey is my favorite and of course Won Ton Soup. I have been taking Carryout with this establishment since 2004."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery today, had shrimp fried rice, and chicken chow mein, Kungpow chicken, crab puffs, potstickers everything was delicious fresh hot delivery was very speedy quality of food for the price you get is amazing would recommend this place to anyone. Quick and speedy over the phone ordering process very nice and courteous staff I had a great experience 10 out of 10"}
{"text":"My rating is mostly for the service, which was incredibly friendly :).  However the way the food is setup is like a buffet style but they dish it out for you is cheesy and cafeteria like.  And, as always with that style, you're never really sure how long that food has been sitting there.  We had the teriyaki chicken with white rice and it looked delicious but the sauce was so unbelievably plain that it was not good at all.  Egg rolls were average.  Maybe if they have something like General Tsao's (which I didn't see on the menu) I would try it."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst Chinese food I have ever had the misfortune to come across. The Orange Chicken tastes like bar-b-que. The Won Ton soup is  bland, the beef is too tough, and though the Crab puffs are huge, they are way too sweet.  Also, I think they over charged me by roughly $5. Alas,  I'm was so hungry I just went with it."}
{"text":"It would be 5 stars for the delicious, inexpensive food and the huge portions of their lunch specials (big enough for at least two people) for under $5. The food is always hot and tasty! I always recommend it to my friends and they all love it too. The building is kind of gross looking but the food is soooo good!

There are only 2 thing that are not as good as they should be.One is the wait even if you order over the phone and they say it will be 10-20 mins and you get there in 20-25 mins and they still make you wait another 15 mins like they are just getting to your order. The reason to call ahead is to have the order ready when you arrive. This happens every time we order. And quite often the orders are not correct. SO, you always have to check the details of your order before you leave.

Second, some of the women who work at the counter are incredibly rude like they dont care if anyone ever comes back to their restaurant. Their service is bad enough to the point that if their food wasn't incredible my family and friends wouldn't go there. The Asian women behind the counter are always friendly and smiling and I pray that they are working when we go there (and not the rude woman and her daughter who we think may be the owners.) I wish those two cared about customer service at all. You shouldn't go into a restaurant feeling like you should have to provide the staff with customer service so you get your order straight and so you dont get snide comments from the staff because of their mistakes. It's kind of ridiculous. Yes to me this is the fatal flaw with Chen & Wok. That is what took the 5th star! 

BUT! I will absolutely still keep going there because the food is soooooo good and I will still keep praying that the nice Asian ladies will be behind the counter so that I will get decent customer service."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few times and each time was not good. The food was bland and tasteless each time. I originally went with a friend who raved about this place and I read reviews, so I had to try, right? Oh no, never again. This last time we called for take out, because it was the only place open on a Saturday afternoon, the chicken was gray, the food was disgusting and greasy! It was $47 down the drain. We won't be returning. I'm all for a hole in the wall type place if it's good, but this place isn't for us."}
{"text":"Bad, bad, fucking bad Orange chicken. No flavor at all. Tastes like it was made from all AP flour and no cornstarch was used. Did they even use Orange juice, zest, or ginger? I swear it doesn't taste like it. If I was a stoner and didn't know any better then I guess I wouldn't complain but I do know better. Seriously was disappointed. I also had their bar-b-qued pork off their apps (I think) list and it wasn't to bad but not good for the price."}
{"text":"Our favorite dive Chinese restaurant.  Whenever we are back in Phx we go here.  Why?

1.  The best crab puffs on the planet
2.  The best fried rice that we have ever had!
3.  Sweet and sour sauce that they make on site, SOOO good.
4.  Never had anything that wasn't really good, really hot, and portions are extremely generous.

Can I transport this place back to Jacksonville???  We are sorely in need of decent Chinese food."}
{"text":"Definitely not a dine in restaurant no fountain drinks no ice water was warm and the food was a 4"}
{"text":"Chen Wok is probably the best Chinese place in Surprise, we probably order here once a week and delivery is so fast! They always tell me within an hour and they're always here 15 minutes early or less!

My family and I like trying new things on the menu, but our favorite is probably the house fried rice, orange chicken, and crab puffs! The sweet and sour sauce is apparently made in house and it's the tastiest I've had. 

The workers are so nice and helpful and the owner is the sweetest man, he always gives us free egg rolls with our order.

Chen Wok deserves more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today and not so good. Chicken was over cooked and poor attitude."}
{"text":"Chen & Not.
My orange chicken was ok. I've had much better. It was hot, temp hot, not spicy hot... like so hot I couldn't eat it. Like, I left it in the microwave too hot, if that makes sense. I had to cut pieces in half and wait for them to cool.
My husband's mongolian beef was weird. The meat was spongy and just well, weird. He didn't even finish it.
Most combo plates come with an egg roll or won tons or something. not her...nope, just meat and rice.
The only drinks they have are pop in cans or water bottles and bottled drinks, no fountain drinks. And my can of 7up was only kind of cold.
We also saw the owner (he obviously doesn't speak English) yelling at the girl who takes orders. The chinese woman in there was translating the yelling. It was very unprofessional to do in front of customers.
We will not return. Bleck."}
{"text":"Top 5 chinese restaurant in the state of Arizona, best food ever, its set up for take out, owners are always there, and they deliver."}
{"text":"Doesn't get much better a far as takeout goes. Chicken fried rice is the best around, lemon chicken and house special chicken are also standouts. I have been here several times and food is always hour and delicious and service is great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Having gone here on numerous occasions since we moved here two and 1/2 years ago I have Never been disappointed! The serving size is adequate unless you order a fried Rice or Lo Mein family portion and then you'll receive a quart container with about 2 portions in it! Their Orange chicken and their General Tsaos are surpassed by No one and their Hot & Sour soup is beyond reproach! If you're ever in the area do your self a favor and get something, as I haven't had such good Chinese food since I lived in NY and would go to downtown Manhattan to Chinatown for food after work every Saturday night at 5am! It's well worth it my friends, well worth it!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese take out in Phoenix. Not saying much. I've tried a lot around here and this is the closest to how I remember Chinese food as a kid. Still not that great. Has a lot of the same problems most of the places around here have. Doesn't taste fresh, poor quality and cuts of meat. If you get white breast chicken, it isn't SO bad, but just normal is nearly inedible. Everything tastes too greasy for me. 

(What happened to all the GOOD Chinese take out? I don't remember it all being this bad when I was younger.)

But again, this place is the best of the worst. Staff is friendly, food is ok if you get that craving, restaurant seems pretty clean and you get pretty generous portions. Check it out."}
{"text":"This place has gotten much better than the first time trying it the year they opened.  Now, the food is much tastier.  We usually get the shrimp dishes: fried rice, lo mein and shrimp with lobster sauce.  All tasty and as good as you can get for chinese food in Surprise."}
{"text":"Pork Chop Suey. Simple, Delicious."}
{"text":"It had been ages since I'd been to Chen Wok (as I had previously called it bc I had no clue all these years that there was an \"&\")  and it was like I stepped into a time warp.  Nothing about the place had changed, and not in an \"eew this place needs a remodel\" kind of way, but in a \"wow, this brings back some great memories\" kind of way.  As the neighborhood staple for Chinese food, this place was getting busy, but my food still came out piping hot and delicious.  In fact it even made it all the way across town and was still hot & yummy.  

Gotta love the Moo Shu Pork, although I really wish they gave you more than 3 crepes.  And the House Chicken is super yummy.  Their prices are super reasonable and they even have coupons on their web page.  With this I got a pint of Moo, Pint of House, (which came with a pint of white rice), and 8 crab puffs all for $11.89.

Dear Chen (&) Wok,  I'm sorry it took me so long to get back to you, I won't let it happen again!"}
{"text":"Growing up near this little hole in the wall, this place was a constant stop for my family. It's really good, greasy chinese food that basically tastes like you would expect it to. Now that I live farther away I still have cravings for their delicious orange chicken and chicken fried rice. If you're nearby during lunch try out a lunch special, really great prices!"}
{"text":"Great little place.  Lunch special is awesome w many choices and it lasts up until 5 pm mon thru fri.  Portions are huge. Food is flavorful.  Great Chinese food at decent prices. Don't let the one stars fool you. I am pretty picky about Chinese food this place is up to my standards"}
{"text":"Absolute best place for Asian food ever!!! Huge servings for a great price! So many options, the whole family will love it!! It's my kids favorite place to eat!! I've been eating here for years, and will continue to do so! And they deliver!! Winning!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after work.  The sign says Chen and Wok gourmet Chinese food.  I disagree I had the sweet-and-sour chicken and it was just white rice with the chicken and just a sweet and sour sauce poured over the top no bell pepper no onion not GOURMET!  I would not go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Hola.. Went there today for lunch and order sweet and sour shrimp with egg fried rice   there was only one cook.. The food didn't turned out like last time.. Hot,fresh,and very tasty..  Last time I ordered the shrimp.. There was pineapple,onions,with alot of flavor.. But didn't see the 5 Mexican cooks in the back cooking.. The cashier looks like she needs a slap in the face ... Lol.  Sorry, old grouchy lady.. She's always there.   Yes.. I need more napkins.. My son spilled soda on the table.. Huh?? What.  No napkins.  Miss.. NAPKINS PLZ..... Ohhhhh napkins.  Here napkins.  Lol. The shrimp was just deep fried with sweetsauce.. Nothing special.. Wifey.. I think the cooks don't wk here anymore."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot !! Great prices and great flavor ! My all time favorite is the #7 lunch special kung pao chicken white meat and a drink for about $6 ! Don't forget to ask for white meat or it will come with dark ! Service is always good great attitude and always friendly !! Love this place"}
{"text":"Best fried rice and orange chicken I've ever had! Such a good value too! Favorite Chinese place ever !!!!"}
{"text":"I recently ate here again. The food was delivered prior to the promised LONG wait, and it was HOT and fresh. I have now become a devout fan of this little Chinese takeout place! My dinner guest was equally as impressed with all of the food. I will say that I thought that the sweet and sour was a little dry, but everything else was delicious. We were impressed that they didn't shirk on the shrimp and the shrimp were large and delicious! Is it gourmet and to be served on white linen? No. It's Chinese takeout that you eat in your sweats in front of the TV. 
 
Just wanted to show Chen and Wok some love with another star!"}
{"text":"Have lived in the area for 5 years and this is the only place I go to. They're quick, it's clean, the food is great and they're very nice. You can get free crab puffs usually when the menu comes out in the mail. They're reasonably priced and always recommend to new friends in the area."}
{"text":"Well, I went in here with hopes that were maybe to high.  I'd seen a friend eating take-out from this place that smelled divine.  

The food was much less expensive than I had expected, one star.
The counter staff was knowledgable and my food was timely, one star.
The table tops were dirty but there was ample parking.
The vegetables in my chicken and vegetables were crisp, one star.
There are no pineapple, tomato or pepper chunks in their sweet and sour dishes, minus a star.
The amount of styrofoam that place went through in just the time I was there was scary.  They need a greener solution to their operation."}
{"text":"Been going here for the orange chicken since I was a kid! Moved back to PHX awhile back and realized they do delivery! Super fast and piping hot! I was greatly surprised how good their food was for delivery:) It's our new go to, and I'm telling anyone that cares because great Chinese take out or delivery is hard to find in Central Phx!"}
{"text":"I have been sick as of late and I had a HANKERING for some hot and sour soup.  So, I took my sick self down the street and was delighted to find out how cheap the food was!! 

 It looked to be about a quart (family size) of soup, for $4.25! The also had a small size for $2.50. Yesssss!  I ordered two and the vegetarian bowl (steamed veggies with rice and sauce).  

The food was so good that I went back for more for dinner. 

Quick review: cheap eats, tasty grub, stuff available without meats, food comes out fast!  

It's a short review, I know...but sometimes short and sweet is just what the doctor ordered."}
{"text":"First time eating here, the food was all fresh and delicious......... except the egg rolls. Everything else was on point. The egg rolls are the typical tiny frozen spring rolls you'd get from any fast food place. The cashew chicken, broccoli beef, Hunan beef and orange chicken along with the chicken fried rice were all extremely delicious! Just don't get the egg rolls."}
{"text":"I've tried several other Chinese restaurants in the area lately, but none are as good as Chen & Wok.  They have been around for 25+ years for a reason!!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Cooked within your view.  Prices are great (especially for lunch).  I recommend the House Chicken (ask for all white).
Pepsi shop."}
{"text":"The food is always hot and fresh.  They make it while you wait.  But, it is a bit bland.  Egg rolls are delicious. The place itself could be cleaner... It's a great deal for the quality /quantity of food."}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled upon this place.  It is small, somewhat clean, nice, random customers, and attended by people with a distinctly noticeable accent.  Everything I've been looking for, since i moved back from the Bay Area, in a Chinese restaurant.    

The Servings where big and the prices where cheap.  Everything i ate was delicious.  I cant wait to come back and try other things on their menu.  Almost as good as my Bay Area favorites."}
{"text":"Decent food ... OK service and pricing.  This is close to my house and a convenient place to eat Chinese food."}
{"text":"I haven't been to eat here in years. Reason for the review is. Their was a time back in the mid 90's all the way thru the early 2000's we used to eat here at least once a week. We had a close friend that lived almost right next door in an apartment complex. And at his recommendation we all stopped in to Chen & Wok.  Some of  the things we ordered were shrimp with mixed veggies. Chow mein or lo men with chicken and one with veggies. Which is the soft noodles. Also tofu with mixed veggies. We stopped going after getting sick several times after eating there. We really liked Chen &Work so we didn't stop right away. We stayed away for a couple of weeks before trying them again. And then again we would get sick. We narrowed the problem down to....at least from what we could taste they were using old oil over and over. The next day just felt warm and felt like you were starting  to get the flu. 
Don't stop going this is just a review based on years back. Since I haven't been. IDK they may have improved.  And I hope they have. Because I love  small unpretious places like Chen & Wok. Easy in easy out. Nothing fancy fast and delicious. Simple seating nothing fancy. No formalities eat and go.
I haven't found any thing similar in my new home here in the Pacific Northwest. 
It's defineity some thing that's lacking up here."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews and had not been to the Chen Wok in quite a while. I ordered takeout and it was hot, fresh and tasty. Their orange chicken is probably my favorite. The chicken lo mein was excellent. Their eggrolls were plump, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside and not at all greasy. In short, the eggrolls were the best I have had in any restaurant in town. They provided an excellent meal for a low price."}
{"text":"Right on Lancaster Blvd. Small gem of a Chinese eatery. We had sizzling rice soup that was very tasty with a hearty broth and plenty of shrimp, beef, and chicken. Early bird menu is economical and varied. We had beef and broccoli and the Kung pao chicken. Both were very fresh and tasty. A great stop."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst food I have ever eaten. The chicken was heavily processed, battered and fried, but somehow stale and soggy at the same time! Egg rolls were a joke. The facility was poorly maintained on the inside with cardboard over the door. The fake trees/plant looked as they've never been dusted and there boxes in the corner that contained who know what. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Our family's go-to Chinese take out in the NW Valley. It's fast, authentic, cheap and delicious.

The small Hot and Sour soup $3) was large and filling, but be careful you don't burn your mouth gulping it down.

The crispy fried duck was delicious when coupled with the spicy sauce. The Chicken and Veggies was a bit over-sauced even though I asked for light sauce.

I wish there was a no-sauce healthier option. Healthy Chinese food isn't easy to find...

Anyway, the food is always satisfying for the family and the wallet!"}
{"text":"I started going here since the place opened a few years ago. There was no other Chinese place in Surprise (that I knew of) at the time. Oil is definitely a main ingredient in their dishes. The beef dish I had once was pretty bad and never ordered it again but always loved the orange chicken with lo mein noodles. Lunch specials are pricey. Now that I'm a vegetarian, I have better options so I've never went back. The owner is friendly but always on the phone taking orders. They don't take American Express."}
{"text":"Great customer service and super friendly staff. My favorite place for crab puffs. The food is really good too."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I ordered traditional Szechwan Beef. Instead it was flank steak, onions and peppers. Add Cheez Whiz and a bun and it would have been a cheap Philly Cheese Steak. Awful."}
{"text":"After reading the great reviews I decided to check it out.  I ordered egg rolls,  vegetable fried rice, chop suey and egg foo young.  
I'll have to say that the egg foo young was the strangest entree We have ever been served.  Weird dark brown sauce over tasteless patties consisting of (??).  
The egg rolls were fried to a crisp and not in a good way....
The chop suey and fried rice, however, were both decent.
This was an order to go. Perhaps we should have ordered earlier or later? Nicely located in our neighborhood, so we might possibly consider a second take out try in the future...."}
{"text":"This is one of the best in Surprise.   The food and service is really good and economical. We haven't found one in Surprise that taste as good as Chen Wok."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for a family of 6 costing over $80 with tip. We all agreed quickly into our meal we should have ordered elsewhere. My husband's pepper steak had so much pink he just ate his rice. I felt so bad bc he hadn't eaten all day and there was a lot! of pink! My daughter spit out so much fat from the sweet and sour chicken I let her throw it out. My teriyaki chicken was by far the worst I've ever had! It truly was awful! After 2 bites of what tasted like maple syrup fish I too just ate the rice.  The orange chicken and Mongolian beef was okay according to my kids. As well as the fried rice and crap puffs. Overall rating is equal to 1 star for undercooked, overpriced, poor tasting food, chicken didn't taste like chicken. Service was very good however. Was going to call to complain but being it was late and we were all tired I just chalked it up to never ordering from there again and letting others know our experience."}
{"text":"My first review I eat out all the time with my mom...everybody knows me and her ..so I write with expierence ..THE WORST customer service...I ordered chicken fried rice...chicken tasteless..I swear I left the food with one bite I could barely swallow it ,the manager was terrible didn't offer another alternative to whAt I ordered..just a miserable manger or who knows maybe the owner..but he needs to stay in the kitchen!!!!!!!..I wil NEVER EVER go here even if the other dishes are good..customers service TERRiBLE!!!!...please take classes !! There are sooooo many restaurants !!!!,..your not the onLY ONE ANYMORE..OK..GOT IT!!
Noooo stArs...0 , zEROI
I guess I have to give you one star I can post .oh well your lucky"}
{"text":"Always great no matter what I order.  I live out of their delivery area, but I'm happy to make the drive"}
{"text":"I went for the first time a few days ago. The fried rice was the best I've had in a while. My only \"complaint\" was that the spicy sautéed chicken was the least spicy thing I've ever eaten, but still tasty. This will most likely be my new regular take out place."}
{"text":"The Beef Lo Mein was extremely bland.

I've been going there off and on for a while, but lately the quality has decreased significantly to the point I feel I have to write this.  Normally the Beef Lo Mein is full of flavor, but it tasted like absolutely no sauce was cooked into the mix.  It was flavorless except the natural flavors of the onions and other ingredients.  Either they rushed my order and didn't take the time to prepare it, or the new cook shouldn't be back there making the dishes.  I'm hesitant to go back after such a bad meal, which I'm now I'm only eating because there is nothing left around me and I don't have time to go back and have them remake it.

If you save a few pennies on how much sauce you add, you lose the sale of a customer which is the bigger picture.  Make quality food or don't make it at all.  PERIOD."}
{"text":"Typically this is my go to spot for take out. I hadn't been there in a while when I called in my order last night. The store was filthy. It looked like they had been slammed with business all day long. The wait was also long. The thing that really got me....this obviously annoyed customer gave some feedback, not rude, but I could see he was clearly annoyed, when another customer was rude to him, ok fine, but then one of the mail employees told the customer to go home...really??? How about cook some of the orders and not yell at those who contribute to your pay check. Not sure if I will be back, after all, Big Buddha is close and very good."}
{"text":"So I lived for a year in surprise, Az. Chen & Wok is a small chain, they have a location out there. I liked their House fried rice better, then this locations. It's ALMOST the same, but this location's lack's pork. 

But nonetheless the house friend rice is really good, better then I've had at a lot of chinese places here in the valley."}
{"text":"Look maybe I'm biased because I currently live down the street and I ONLY, I repeat ONLY get 2 things off the menu here. SO I can ONLY vouch for those 2 ITEMS i do purchase. But they make BOTH OHHHHHHHH so good. 

They have a house speclial FRIED RICE thats BOMBBBBBB ladies n gentlmen. I HIGHLY suggest it. I mean it's so good I write my name on it in my fridge, that good. 

I also get the egg drop soup WITH cracker thingy's they sell for a little extra $. All in all when I call up to order these 2 items it takes them about 15 min to prepare and I go pick it up then enjoy. 

Again this is the only 2 items I have ever ate here, Honestly I have no complaints about either thus why I don't change it up."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and ordered from the lunch menu. Both the Orange chicken and Mongolian beef were what you'd expect them to be for a place that does mainly takeout - tasty and cheap. The 'regular' size was just right for lunch. Our bill for two people was less than $13. We will definitely visit them again."}
{"text":"I must have forgotten how terrible this place was.  

I went in for lunch and ordered chicken lo mein.  4.68 for a huge meal must have sounded good to me at the time.

5 minutes go by and they call my number.  I open it up and it is a massive meal mounding in the middle and weighing a good 3-4 pounds.  

I dig in and it is hot and has a decent flavor.  A few bites into it you start to realize there is almost NO signs of vegetables or life.  The parts of chicken are not recognizable.  Small and tied together with fat strings completely unrecognizable pieces of dark meat.  I'm talking things that look like knee caps, maybe a chicken elbow here or there?

A few more bites of the noodles and white rice and specs of vegetables and I trash the rest.

I can't believe people can starve when they serve you this much food for under five bucks.  But then again...after eating it one more time I guess I can understand why you would starve yourself if this was your only option.

I'm Done with chen wok with a capital D."}
{"text":"The portion sizes are very good, one entree will feed a couple people. The large soups are more than one person can eat. I order take out, had the moo shoo pork , the crepes were good sized, but there was a half inch of standing watery broth in the plastic bag. I am glad it didn't spill in my car. It was fairly tasty.  I also had the szechuan beef, wasn't very tasty and the pieces of beef were too big. But I live in the delivery range, and I an sure I will hit good items off the menu.  Good food is hard to come by in Surprise."}
{"text":"Best orange chicken and crab puffs ever! Even Better than PF Changs and that's like real Chinese food guys so that's really sayin somethin!"}
{"text":"One of the best quick Chinese places.  Great prices and great food.  The house chicken is amazing.  We also got the ragoons which were amazing.  Use to go here all the time 20 years ago when I lived in the area.  Recipes are still the same and taste great.  My son even said it was better than Panda..."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food is a hard commodity in AZ.  Chen & Wok is a dependable and delicious take out place.  I usually stop by after a hike on North Mountain.  I think there Shrimp and Lobster sauce is lip-smacking good.  And if you go before 3pm, you can take advantage of their great lunch spells.  You get a ton of food for 5 or so bucks.  If only I lived closer."}
{"text":"I live down the street from Chen and wok. It smells garlicky and delicious outside my front door often! ( Wait. unless jack n the box has some secret menu I don't know about! ) 

Smells great. Taste.. Ehhh, not out of this world. If you're desperate, And want someone to be rude to you taking your order via phone this is where I will call. 

I'm in no way opposed to supporting local businesses so kudos to you if this is your fave neighborhood takeout joint. No shame. In my opinion it's just not that stellar.

I have eaten here at least ten times over the course of two years. So I've really tried to like it. I would never actually have written a review if I had not read all the positive reviews and felt it my duty to be a tiny bit more subjective less omg amazing. 

Egg rolls. Egg roll is to chinese food is to taco is to burrito. Standard. They get the wonton wrapper right but the cabbage lettuce meat filling disappointing. It seems legit, perfectly crispy fried, piping hot, I've got my REAL spicy mustard (not that tiny red packet stuff for babies they give you) you have to ASK the less than friendly lady at the counter for (almost always accompanied by an eye roll), You bite into the egg roll but there's not that much flavor. And that's after my dip into sweet n sour and hot mustard. The lettuce thickness is not thinly chopped or as consistent as many other restaurants can easily produce. But every place is a little different I get that. 

Crab puffs- more like hot air balloon shaped wonton wrapper with cream cheese and like no crab. They aren't awful, but I also eat cream cheese by itself with a spoon on occasion so I guess I'm a little biased. So they're ok in my book. 

Orange chicken - I have regretted ordering it a few times. For some reason I thought it was an off night, would be better next time, just never really worked for me. Not enough sauce, awkward sized bites, got dark meat when I asked for white. 

I can honestly say worst egg drop soup, ever. It's not soup, it's barely a broth. Sorry! 

Tip: if you want any of the fried rice and don't want the all inclusive entire bottle of kikoman soy sauce just ask, they will omit for you. Way less salty and tastes pretty good. 

Quality prices for sure. Kitchen staff looks like they're working super hard in that tiny kitchen, too! 

I know what I am getting into if this is my choice out of convenience to feed myself. Why don't you be the judge?"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here and so are the portions. However, make sure you check your bag every time you go. They staple and tie the bag but it's worth opening and checking. Especially if you order white rice. Without fail, every single time we've been there they have forgotten that. If you want it delivered it'll probably be about 45 min and if they forget something(95%of the time) then it's another 45 min(even if it's one box). I used to eat there frequently but it's time to start checking other places out. 
The food isn't bad, it's the customer service. My dad called upset and stated that it happens every single time whether we are in store or having it delivered and they had the nerve to question him about the order as if he was lying. And on top of it there were no apologizes or discounts or anything given."}
{"text":"Really great place would recommend to anyone. Only thing that was negative was the new asian lady taking orders. I don't know if she doesn't speak English but she has a hard time explaining the menu items. She also lacks customer service skills. Too bad I wanted to try new items."}
{"text":"We ordered Kung Pao Chicken,Orange Chicken and Crab Puffs. All amazing! And delivered way early. Great place! Definitely will order again!"}
{"text":"I keep going back to chicken  low mein. A little  on the oily side but plenty I found flavors  and a good portion for 6 dollars"}
{"text":"Wanted something  simple . Ordered wanton soup the wantons were mushy and the meat was chewy. Tried their moos shu pork . This salty and had too mu h soy day e . The pan akes were dry.  Had ma p.o. tofu. The tofu was old and the sauce was salty. . Prices were reasonable.  We still had to wait when we got there"}
{"text":"most likely will not be returning to this location. the employees that i dealt with- wasn't able to catch any names- girls were not the most friendly workers that i have ran into. were not helpful at all with questions that i had regarding the menu, and therefore the food i received wasn't what i was expecting. didn't live up to the hype i had heard from others, and it was too pricey. better chinese out there than chen wok."}
{"text":"Chen & Wok is on the top of my list when it comes to quick chinese food.  Their house fried rice is very good and comes loaded with big chunks of meat and large shrimp.  Their lunch bowls are good and are a fair value.  I usually opt for the Kung Pao Chicken.  I have yet to be disappointed by anything I have ordered."}
{"text":"We've lived around the corner from this place for 12 years and we order takeout about once a month. The food is always excellent and the portions are large. The owners and staff are very friendly. I believe it's important to support small businesses and always give then a chance to make it right or correct an issue."}
{"text":"First time here. Lunch special was priced well, huge servings. Staff was friendly. Food was OUTSTANDING. I had been on my way to a Chinese Chain Store and diverted here.....was a GREAT idea."}
{"text":"Got broccoli beef and the beef tastes like day old reheated meat.. got Kung pao chicken, where's the chicken?? They forgot by crab puffs also.. fried rice was good though"}
{"text":"One plus for Chen Wok is the employees actually speak an Asian language which I assume was Chinese.  That also might have been creating a problem as the lady taking my order seemed a little confused about things.  She did take my order, clearly, I thought for teryaki chicken.  I did ask her twice for chop sticks.  When when she gave me my tray there was a fork.  I finally convinced her that I really did want those chop sticks.  When my order finally came up they asked me for my number which I was never given.  It was determined that was okay that I didn't get a number and them she said you did order chicken with vegetables.  It wasn't what I ordered but decided it would be more trouble than it was worth to get what I really wanted.

My dinner was pretty bland but that was okay because I took what they gave me.  Surprising thing is that there was more chicken than vegetables, usually the opposite of what one might expect.  Overall there wasn't much flavor and some gristle in the chicken but it filled me up.  Overall that is the objective when one sits down to eat, isn't it?

If I had gotten what I had asked for and it had been about the same, I would have put two stars."}
{"text":"Never disappointed.  Friendly service.  Fast.  Food is fresh and delish!  It's our go-to place for Chinese!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. You definitely get more for your $. I recommend paying a little extra for all white meat when ordering chicken entrees. Delicious"}
{"text":"My husband just picked up dinner for us and I bit into a piece of shrimp only for it to taste rotten. You know it's bad when there's a fishy smell
And taste...it wasn't fresh shrimp. Nice people not so nice food."}
{"text":"Never again.  Soup was tasteless and all the food was missing in flavor.  Fried rice had been burned.  We ordered delivery and when the food arrived we noticed how hot it was.  After we began eating I noticed the containers had a note on them \"microwave safe\", which is ironic because I believe all the food was prepared sometime long before delivery and microwaved just before delivery.  VERY disappointing.  We won't be calling them again."}
{"text":"I used to like this place, but yesterday when I had a delivery I found a baby cockroach in the bag my Teriyaki Chicken was in. I immediately called them and the manager said she'd send out another order and refund my money... The food never came.  Today I called her and she changed her story saying she never said she'd send out another order... So I guess in her mind a free meal with bugs is a good way to take care of their customers.  I of course didn't eat the food, and I'll never eat there again.  In conclusion, IF YOU LIKE COCKROACHES IN YOUR FOOD & DEALING WITH MANAGEMENT THAT DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO PROVIDE GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE WHEN THINGS DON'T GO THEIR WAY... EAT AT CHEN & WOK!"}
{"text":"I would say 2.5 stars for this place, and I say that somewhat hesitantly.   Let's agree that quantity without quality is not always a good thing.  I can't say that my lunch was bad, but the large portion of Teriyaki Chicken  ($4.59 w/ tax) with the super big chunks of dark meat chicken (or was it?) , extra sweet, syrupy sauce (I know, it's teriyaki) and just plain 'ole white rice was definitely edible, but not memorable.  Service was fast, but not especially friendly.  

From now on,  I'll think I'll reserve my asian fix for a slighly more \"upscale\" spot, like Pei Wei for a few bucks more."}
{"text":"Chinese food that's cheap, fast, and good.  What else could you want?  

Turns out... this place was right next to my chiropractor that I've been seeing for over a year and I smelled the chinese food and was aching for it, so I mentioned it to one of the people in there, and they were like \"Duh, Jess... it's right next door\".

Whoops... blond moment.  Or maybe a blond year?

They actually offer Wor Wonton Soup!  Yay! I enjoyed it... they put some good meat in it.  I don't know what it is though about chinese places... they make this stuff so hot it melts the styrofoam cup and cap to take it home!  They luckily wrapped it in a sack, so it didn't leak or anything, but it was disturbing.

I also had the curry chicken.  Yummy... not that spicy though, but enough to satisfy my curry craving."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week and I have always been very impressed.  We have never had a bad meal.  The service is great and the small family atmosphere is great.  I would recommend Chen Wok to anyone."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Chinese take-away in the area. I'm not particularly fussy when it comes to Chinese food - it doesn't take a great deal of skill to make and typically it all tastes the same to me, so I'm basing this review on value for money. You get a LOT of food for your buck here. I'll usually get two dishes and a fried rice and for about $20 I'll walk out with about three pounds of food. They pack the fried rice so tightly into a large container that you almost need a shoehorn to get it out later. Some dishes are quite tasty - my favourite is the pork with black mushroom and snow peas.

Some dishes, however, aren't that great. An order of Mongolian Pork would have been better termed \"Mongolian Onion\" - 1 part pork to ten of green and regular onions and sauce. And as for the Yui Shan chicken, eurgh. Weakly spiced, sludgy, and sweet as molasses - chicken, zucchini, carrot and mushroom. Won't get that one again.

Most of the time you'll get your order in 10 min or less, but I've been there when it's been busy and then they kinda buckle and I was waiting over 30 mins. Wasn't a problem that night, but if it becomes a habit.. (shrug)

Anyway, better than Big Buddha (Greenway and 303) - way too pricey with way too few items on the menu -  and a tiny bit better than Golden Wei (although GW has a larger seating area). Chen&Wok is a tiny place, about maybe 6-7 Costco tables, so it's better to order take-out than sit in there under their bright lights and have dinner while watching Andrew Zimmern eat frog's pizzles on their crapburger 10\" telly.."}
{"text":"Always the best food here. Orange chicken, house fried rice. I have yet to find a better one here in Phoenix. Even delivered the food is hot and crunchy  not soggy... I had all kinds of different things here but orange chicken is by far best!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch & this place was packed! I could immediately tell this was a popular spot for locals. I ordered spring rolls and orange chicken with lo mein. The sauce was amazing but my biggest complaint was the pieces of chicken, they were huge pieces, sometimes with lots of fat and others were just huge pieces of breading. The lo mein it came with was great! I would probably try something next time that wasn't fried just because of the sizes and quality of the chicken they used. The ladies behind the counter were really sweet & friendly so that was a big plus!"}
{"text":"I ordered food from here fifteen minutes before they opened thinking that it would speed up the process.  The guy who answered the phone said they will be here an hour from when they opened.  No big deal, but it took them thirty minutes longer than they quoted. I ordered the sweet and sour pork lunch special.  It's very bland, just fried meat with sauce,  no vegetables.  I thought they would come with the usual onion, bell peppers and pineapple, but no.  I got noodles instead of rice. The noodles are also bland.  I'm never going to order or eat here again.  Save your money,  call someone else for delivery.  If was to go out to a restaurant, I would go to golden Phoenix. They are where it's at."}
{"text":"I used to go to this location at least 3 times a week...then one day...the soup tasted like the smell of the bathroom...

I stopped going for a long time then a co-worker wanted to go there....ok, let's give it a try, I thought.

I'm not going to get this place into too much trouble saying what I really want to say...but the health inspectors need to visit...ick.  (it involves lots of bugs that can survive a nuclear explosion)

I can't believe this place has almost 5 stars. Crazy."}
{"text":"I had such a craving for chinese food yesterday that I wanted to find someplace I had never been before and check it out.  So I went to Yelp and thought I would seek a recommendation, one of the recommendations was Chen & Wok.  I read the reviews and thought, why not give it a shot.  

The reviews are right, the place is in a strip mall and really nothing to look at but it was clean inside.  I walked right in and ordered a chicken lo-mein lunch special and a small hot & sour soup.  The service was pretty quick and I was really hungry.  Now I have been to many chinese restaurants and most of them specify whether or not the meal is dark meat or if you would like to substitute for white meat then you can.  I was disappointed when my lo-mein came out and it was full of dark meat.  Not being a fan of dark meat I pick it out and ate the noodles.  The noodles were pretty good and had a good flavor.  The hot & sour soup was pretty good.  Not the best, kind of tart and not really spicy.  I asked for chile paste and added it myself for a little bit more of a kick.

This place was not horrible, it was just ok.  I would probably go back and try some of their other dishes, but this next time I will remember to ask for white meat if I have a chicken dish."}
{"text":"This place is really nothing to look at but the good thing is that the food is pretty decent for the price and portion.  I ordered a small mongolian beef for lunch with a hot and sour soup.  The lunch portion was pretty big and the soup was easily enough for two.  The great thing was that I had enough for the lunch the next day!  

This place is near work and is pretty reasonable so I will probably go there again when in need of chinese food!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I love this place! I have been coming here since they were on 75th Avenue and Cactus and then they moved out to Waddell. They give you so much food and it is so incredibly good!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about... nothing to leave home for. Not that great tasting. Chow main had no taste. Orange chicken was good, Mongolian beef was not good at all."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in surprise,  friendly staff and owners. Dining in isn't the greatest but the food is worth ordering and picking up."}
{"text":"Last three times we have ordered, it's been wrong. This last time we called back, they wouldn't help us fix the order and argued that we ordered it wrong. We have been getting food from them for five years. Sorry to say,  this will be the last time."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice - last weekend my boyfriend and I placed an order for delivery. It took forever. Really. I had the Mongolian beef and an order of pot stickers. The bf had lo mein and sweet and sour chicken. The pot stickers were good. The rest varied from OK. (lo mein and Mongolian beef) to inedible ( sweet and sour chicken). This weekend I'm feeling under the weather so we decided to try their soup. We picked it up instead waiting until we're both old and gray for them to deliver it. I had the won ton soup - not good. It tasted like dish water. He had the hot and sour soup..it was sour but not hot...not very good. This was my first shot at finding a place for Chinese in my neighborhood...I think we'll keep looking."}
{"text":"In three words: not too shabby.

I've been weary with Chinese delivery in Phoenix so testing this place out was a big step for me.  And while I am still not a PHX Chinese food lover yet, Chen & Wok helped better my view. 

The crab puffs and vegetable lo mein are great. My friend got the Sesame Chicken and wasn't too impressed...  It wasn't that horrible but I wouldn't recommend ordering it. The egg rolls were decent, but not the best. The thing that made it for me was the egg drop soup. I love it, but i hate the stuff you get from most places that has a consistancy of snot. C & W's egg drop is light and liquidy, like soup, not ooze. It was tasty, with mushrooms, peas, and carrots. 

The best thing about them: they told us the food would take an hour, they were at my house in about 30 min. So yeah, I'll probably order from them again, unless someone in yelp land lets me know about a better spot."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in years.  Their food is mediocre but they deliver & we are hungry.  I ordered over an hour & a half ago.  I understand it is Saturday night but really.

Thank you for confirming that this place sucks on many levels.  Last time I ordered from this place (a few years back) there was plastic in my soup.  I thought it was a fluke but called to complain & they asked for proof.

This food better be good.

I doubt it.  

Never again let hunger override better judgement.

It took 1 hour & 45 minutes to arrive at my house.  I will be calling tomorrow to complain.

 Just as horrible as expected.  Every dish was barely above warm.  Bland & the chicken teriyaki was hard, dry & teriyucky!  Do not eat here!  Let them shrivel up, close & allow a good restaurant to open in it's place."}
{"text":"I love lovelove Chen Wok! Amzing food, and service is fast. I eat there all the timeand they have only messed up my order once, by giving me the wrong kind of rice and had it fixed in a few minutes. There delivery is really fast also. My favorite dish is Sweet and Sour Chicken w white rice."}
{"text":"Went here at lunchtime had orange chicken and my friend had vegetables with pork my orange chicken was very gristly my brown fried rice was very cool to the touch her pork was also very grizzly quality was not good at all and there was a hair on her plate with the vegetables and pork we returned our food and got a refund they were very accommodating with the refund however quality of food was terrible I Don't know what planet these people are from that gave them five stars"}
{"text":"I pulled this based on reviews.  I should have taken the clue that \"ideal for greasy Chinese food\" was NOT what I look for.  For me - Chinese food is crisp, clean, and screams fresh.  None of that applied here.  Don't get me wrong - it's edible.  Doesn't give me any reason to avoid it, but it didn't make me want to come back again.  The crab puffs were the highlight - but again - those tasted as if they had been cooked earlier and had been sitting.  I didn't taste much crab either.  Portions were generous, staff were great, food was hot.  But I have to say - when I order Orange Chicken - I best get a taste of orange.  I didn't.  It was so sad to have to say ... meh.  Next."}
{"text":"Reliable and consistent! The crab puffs are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese take out in town. They have the best crab puffs I have ever had. You can't beat the 20 options they have for a $3.25 lunch special. The Kung Pao chicken is great, but the chicken chow mein and orange chicken are delicious as well."}
{"text":"Want cheap hole in the wall Chinese deliciousness? Yup this is the spot. It kind of reminds me of Chinese food in New York. Great lunch menu. This place will have you coming back."}
{"text":"So if you like decent food and a lot of it don't go here. I ordered broccoli beef teriyaki chicken dinner and house lo main and it felt like 15 pounds of food.  The house lo main is my favorite chicken pork and shrimp with noodles.  When you call wait times are between 15-30 depending on when you order and how busy they are. I always feel someone bad eating here because it's right next to a gym. I walk out completely full getting in my truck looking at people working out."}
{"text":"General Tso's and chicken fried rice had no flavor.  Chicken in the fried rice was chopped up."}
{"text":"Excellent food. They actually deliver. I've called other restaurants that had a \"yes\" in the delivery section and they don't deliver. Not sure if that is the fault of the restaurants or Yelp. Anyway, the food is great and I will be ordering from them time and time again. My toddler loved the food too (she's very picky)."}
{"text":"We've ordered about 4 times. And it's not bad chineese. However, I am very allergic mushrooms and I don't do breaded chicked. Tonight we ordered take out. We have family in town. When we ordered we said \"no mushrooms on this dish, she's allergic\". Once we got the food home we noticed there was in fact these pesky littlw buggers that make me sick. Very sick. Imagine having family in town thaf you haven't seen for a long time, sitting down to eat after a long day only to realize you can't eat anything on the table and have to go back (we live avout 10 mins away). I'm so bummed. We will not be back. My advice, because food allergies are dangerous, is to maybe highlight when someone asks for something specific."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Chinese food around. I'm a vegetarian and they special-made me everything using vegetarian ingredients. If you're ordering vegetables, be sure to ask that it's not made with chicken stock. So happy to find a Chinese restaurant willing to accommodate my diet. Really appreciate it!"}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery and were told it would be an hour.  Just under 2 hours later, still no food.  We called and cancelled and they just say sorry.  Do not order delivery...they are too useless to accommodate in a reasonable fashion.  Order at your own risk...just know delivery will be an all day affair."}
{"text":"Love this place better than Panda and especially like how u can upgrade to all white meat chicken."}
{"text":"I am sad to write this review... As I used to LOVE this place. However as of late, it's been hit and miss. More miss than hit. (Insert sad face here!) 

The prices have gone up, serving size has gone down. I'm all about understanding the economy and what not... However this was the best part of eating here. 

I've learned that it's cheaper to order my food ala carte at lunch than as their \"special lunch combo\". 

For example; 

Lunch menu - white rice, sweet sour chicken is $5 (roughly). However if you want the house fried rice (it's so yummy and filling!) it will cost you $4 more! What??!! That's right, almost the cost of the whole meal. So now it's $9 for the \"lunch special\". (It used to be $1.75 up-charge.)

The second to last time I ate there after ordering my lunch (to go) with the upgrade and adding in fried won-tons it came to $14.79. Twice the price as a week before! No joke, it was!!!! First time ever I have never tipped them. Why? what they told me over the phone and then charged me were 2 different prices! The next time I went, I ordered ala carte and it was the same price but with WAY more food. 

Bottom line - order containers at lunch if you want the rice upgrade. The food is good, which is the only reason I gave them 2 stars. 

My stars explained:
(1) location, ease of parking, lights, 
(2) how clean and organized they are, restrooms etc.. (they have never earned a star from me) 
(3) value. which I count as 2 stars 1 * for cash/debit/credit and 1 * for price of food vs quality of food, size of servings."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Orange chicken is way better than panda!! Pork fried rice and my dinner is complete!! Definitely best prices around town!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a tasty lunch.  Since they make everything to order, I often order the mixed vegetables and have them spice it up.  My favorite is the House Special Chicken.  Plenty of food for the price.  A good selection of dishes.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I don't understand these rave reviews. My food was inedible. The sweet & sour pork that came with our \"special family dinner\" was rubbery and soggy. Panda Express at least does some quality control and is reliable. Maybe it was because our order was to go during a busy time and they just didn't care? I do not ever want to try to eat this food again. Sorry, Chen & Wok, we were over before we even started."}
{"text":"Food is good and the price is right!! 
The flavor combination is really good. I like the garlic shrimp and chicken. Rice is cooked right and not over cooked. 

Interesting thing on the lunch if you ask for a water cup iys a 16 oz sized cup. Really good if you are making sure you stay on budget and hydrated."}
{"text":"New to the hood and taken out twice using the economical lunch special menu that runs til 5p EVERYDAY.

First things 1st, they DO use MSG but there are some items where they can omit it upon request.

Second of all, they DO have the REAL Chinese hot mustard. You gotta ask for it. They're not gonna give up the goods that easily ;)

Next, special orders are welcome. So, if you want that veggie delite;) minus the carrots, no msg, sauce on the side and a couple cups of hot mustard to go they got you covered!

Let me tell you C & W has got something going on over here you need to know about! They are quick quick and have VERY GOOD portion size for their price point."}
{"text":"Generic. Bland. No good. Honestly, go to Safeway and buy PF Chang's frozen food, it tastes far superior.

Who in their right mind would give this 5 stars? Two is generous. I'm just not happy with this food quality. Shrimp fried rice should smell & taste, well like shrimp. I can't even find any in here. The orange beef is so covered with gross goopy sauce that you can't even taste beef. Vote with your dollars and eat elsewhere. 

The dining atmosphere is nowhere you want to eat, it's a slap em in and out for lunch. Dining room has. TV blaring."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 5 yrs. Nothing beats their chicken lo mein. You don't even think about the price!!! for less than 30 dollars u can have lunch for 4 to 5 people!!!
Some says that their flavor has decreased? --pls tell it to the owner or the chef, it will help with patrons like us, or new comers. I had one time asked them to add more teriyaki sauce for my order and spice which they did. From now on when I order that item they know to put extra flavoring.

Sometimes our taste buds get used to flavors  and need a little more to get that same flavor were so used to. it's scientifically proven that the more we eat the same thing the brain we crave more of that flavor, :)"}
{"text":"Writing this as a former worker more than 2 years ago,  and Chinese food is my favorite. I recently moved to the east coast and always heard the hype about Chinese food but I have yet to taste anything like Chen wok. I don't order Chinese food here anymore and it's so bad here I send it back. This place has served the best Chinese food and I always brag about it to people here. They don't know what good Chinese food is until you try Chen wok. Surprise Arizona is lucky to have this place. The food is made to order, and it tastes delicious. I came back a year ago and it still tasted wonderful. I can't wait for a future visit"}
{"text":"Too often my enthusiasm for Chinese food detracts from my ability to say anything meaningful about the establishment. 

I order, get food, eat food, rant and rave about food, find out that nobody shares my opinion of said food, rinse, repeat.

With nearly identical menus and service, I was having a hard time finding something interesting, meaningful, and most importantly funny to say about any of these places. It was starting to cramp my style, and I feared that Chinese food would prove to be the knight that slayed the mighty Jetta Dragon. 

I bet you all pegged me as the unicorn type, huh.

Chen and Wok broke what could have been an otherwise endlessly repeating cycle of pointless reviews by being popular with people I knew and giving me something to criticize them for; their service.

First let me start off this review by laying down the obligatory (though not undeserved) lip service.

The food is pretty fucking fantastic. Ever since my coworkers and I discovered their menu at the bottom of our \"take out menu\" drawer, we've been eating that shit like it's going out of style.

Normally just the sight of steamed rice makes me flail my arms and scream in tongue, but after that spicy kung pao or house chicken hits me and my stomach balloons with burn and gas, I'm grateful that I'm not being tempted with a side of lo mein. I usually keep a shamrock mmmmmmilk nearby whenever I order anything denoted on the menu as \"spicy\". Once I experimented with chocolate milk. 

Turns out chocolate milk and kung pao sauce get along like leather daddies and mountainbike enthusiasts; amicable yet jarringly indifferent. 

Look up any takeout menu from any other Chinese place, pick five random items. C&W has it, and its fucking DELICIOUS. 

The food is so good that it warrants the often mindfuckingly tedious task of dealing with the staff. For now, at least.

I admit off the bat that I have a skewed perspective. In my group of co-workers I am the official \"C&W ambassador.\"

I can tell the difference between chow mein and lo mein so apparently that qualifies me to be a fucking interpreter of the culture.

One day not too long ago the IT department managed to pull ourselves away from Japanese Bug Fights and Star Wars done entirely in Terminal long enough to decide that we were hungry, we wanted Chinese, and that although Jetta was in no mood to be yelled at over the phone, she was a bitch and deserved it anyway.

I called in the order and was greeted by my friend Asian Lady With The Inappropriately Loud Voice, who after rushing me through my order and snapping at me when I tried to explain (for the fifth time now) where our office was located, would interrupt my giving of the credit card number by reciting numbers that in no shape, way, or form resembled the ones I gave her. You know, to keep me on my toes.

One of the people on my order really wanted chow mein with his orange chicken. Chinese restaurants' legendary personal grudge with special orders and substitutions aside, I thought that if we just asked for some on the side and not substituted for their flavorless white rice, maybe they would take advantage of the opportunity to provide something resembling customer service and make a few extra bucks.

We all know how this ends, right?

The lady argues with me for a while, and then she argues with Clarice for a while, and eventually we compromise; we have to buy A WHOLE ENTREE of chicken chow mein so our friend can eat the noodles. 

Needles to say my credit card company LOVES C&W.

Perhaps to punish me for my insolence, C Dubs sends an obnoxious and easily confused driver in a bad \"I'm going to community college to learn how to be a game show host\" suit in lieu of our modest and very smiley normal delivery guy. 

The driver refuses to park in the parking lot and instead drives in circles around the parking lot waiting for me to meet him. After I spend 6 minutes on the phone just begging him to park and wait for me, I spend another 10 waiting for him to finish his victory laps.

After botching my name once or twice (how do you get \"Liberty\" out of \"Jetta\"? They're not even made by the same manufacturer!), he hands me two plastic bags which he has TIED together (am I supposed to slump it over my shoulder hobo style?) and drives off. 

Once inside, I find my entree to be so spicy it makes my nose run and my rice to be even colder and more flavorless than usual. 

Hell hath no fury like a Chinese place inconvenienced.

All in all, Chen and Wok is still the Peoria-area Chinese takeout for me. 

But believe me when I say I've never been so happy and excited to see the Goodcents girl walking towards our office."}
{"text":"I've got to say that I have eaten at many, many Chinese food places, and this place has excellent food.

I have sampled many spicy dishes, from the Yui Shan to the Curry, and all were great.

This restaurant has only a few downsides.  The decor is terrible, no kids menu (I am a parent of two), and a lack of high chairs (even though my kids are old enough to use booster seats).

I am strictly rating on quality of food here.  I would love to see them improve the interior of the restaurant to match the quality of the food, but with a full belly, I am not complaining!"}
{"text":"Chen and Wok has really changed in food quality from years ago. The service is good but the food is sooooo so.

First off the outside is a bit smelly, it smells like a trash can. This is the main reason I stopped going here for years...but I ordered delivery and probably should have passed and had a Polar pop instead.

The honey dipped chicken either comes soggy with too much honey and soft wings or dry wings with hardly any honey at all, and the chicken tastes very low in quality.

The shrimp fried rice has large shrimp and would be better if it weren't well done with 4 shrimp total.

The house Lo mein is a hit or miss but in terms of flavor it's the dish I would choose. The egg rolls are also pretty tasty.

All in all Chen Wok just may be the best Chinese food you've ever tasted...as long as you're not a long time customer that can compare it to the glory days."}
{"text":"Shitty little Chinese places usually have alright food.. not this place.. nothing we tried even tasted good. A real emphasis on shitty! Ordered tofu, sweet and sour chicken and egg rolls as well as house lo mein.. I think it was the oil because everything sort of tasted rancid and was seriously greasy. Also the shrimp in the house lo mein didn't smell very good so I picked it out.. still the greasy noodles didn't sit well with me or my friend. She ended up getting sick right afterward though I was fine. 

I am convinced that there is ZERO decent Chinese in Surprise! Perhaps there is another place I should check out?"}
{"text":"Sappy post alert:
I left Chen today almost in tears, and it wasn't from the hot mustard. Today was the quintessential \"one of those days\", and I stopped here to pick up dinner for my family on the way home from work. I arrived 5 minutes after the lunch special cutoff, was a total scatter brain, unable to count the correct cash and then leaving my credit card behind, forgetting to order crab puffs and and just generally having trouble articulating what I wanted to accomplish. 

The woman serving me still let me get my takeout from the lunch specials, and had such a genuinely sweet spirit. I forgot to order a drink, and she gave me my soda on the house. She just ...got it. I don't know if it's women's intuition or what but I needed that little bit of goodwill today. Sometimes a free drink and a little compassion goes a long way. I'll be back. 

Also, 
Good food. Like, really good."}
{"text":"This place was horrific. 

The sign on the door says gourmet, but I think they meant that as a joke, or to be ironic. Hole-in-the-wall is an understatement. 

We walk in and there are a few tables to sit at, however, this is not a dine in joint. You must order at the counter, and unlike Panda Express, you cannot see your food before you order it. 

They asked if it was for here or to go--a customary thing to do--But our food came in to go containers even though were said \"for here.\"

Two seconds after ordering, they brought out our food. I think it's safe to say, there was no real cooking going on behind the scenes. 

I ordered the vegetable fried rice. Believe me when I say I could have made better rice with my feet.

My companion ordered the sweet and sour chicken...completely inedible. It was dark in color, over cooked, and we could not find evidence of chicken present inside the crispy chunks. He took two bites and threw the whole meal away. It left a bad after taste in his mouth.

They do not offer fountain drinks at this establishment, only cans of soda. Which are piled up in the corner like a supermarket display gone wrong. I ordered ice water and received a styrofoam cup of tap water WITHOUT ice in it.

In the end, I fully expected to open the fortune cookie and read, \"You should have known better.\"

Negative star"}
{"text":"Great food from a hole in the wall Chinese place. There people have been here for over 10 years!! I get the chicken and rice bowl and it's great. Hasn't changed in taste in over 10 years."}
{"text":"I love this place. At first I was skeptical about it but after trying it, I eat this food at least once a week. Crab puffs are amazing."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese place. They are always consistent and we get large orders every time. Egg rolls are yummy, crab puffs are delicious and you can pick anything off the menu and it's a winner. The prices are great and the people are awesome!"}
{"text":"There are basically two schools of Chinese food; upscale, fresh ingredients, non-artery clogging Chinese food and hole in the wall, greasy, guilty-pleasure Chinese food. 

This is the latter. 

On a scale of this kind of Chinese food, it's perfect. Big portions, easy on the wallet, fast, convenient, it's got everything. But because there's no different category, 4 stars will have to do."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been long time frequenters of all the Chen & Wok locations. We were pleasantly surprised to find this location. 

We usually go for lunch and have never had a bad experience here.

Their dinner menu is a little pricier than it needs to be and that's why I gave them 4/5 stars. I've never had a bad experience at any of their restaraunts..."}
{"text":"don't, don't, don't...  don't believe the hype.  aside from the apparent body odor special they were running today, the food at this joint is nothing special.  the egg drop soup tastes like frozen peas and carrots.  the lemon chicken lunch special is nothing special - the chicken was fried and very chewy and grainy.  both the customers and the workers were pretty rude - but what do you expect in phoenix?  for people to actually form a line and not begin ordering in the middle of your order?

suckered in by good reviews.  guess that's what i get.  mark this one down as a fail.  won't be returning to this shithole."}
{"text":"Good food. Everything made to expectation. There is a  language barrier when ordering your food. Sometimes you have to shout or spell out what you are ordering. This place has good customer service but can come off rude because of the language/culture barrier. I am a regular here and always enjoyed everything that I have ordered. My go to is the assorted vegetables and rice. Sometimes paired up with a vegetable lo mein. Anytime your in the neighborhood and looking for traditional  oriental food this is a definite suggestion."}
{"text":"My bf introduced me to egg foo young at different Chinese restaurants.  He told me this place had the best egg foo young. Told him i was born and raised in Hawaii so ill be the judge of good Chinese food. Lol. So far this place has the best egg foo young dish. Also ordered almond chicken, beef broccoli, garlic shrimp with chicken, and kung pao shrimp. All of them tasted good. The eggrolls were smaller than expected. If you order more than 20 bucks then will deliver to you. Overrall the food was good."}
{"text":"Me and my family ordered food for delivery from here this past weekend. And it was horrible. The teriyaki chicken was fatty and grisly. The chicken in the chicken chow mien was rubbery from I guess being boiled and was bland. The egg rolls were not impressive at all. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I use to work right down the street from Chen & Wok and ate there every Friday, I moved to Northern Az in 1999 and could not find good Chinese  food, I was in Phoenix and made my way over to Chen & Wok and it was just as good as I remembered it, I ordered 2 large beef and  broccoli with egg fried rice and an order of lo mein noodles I had so much food left over that I brought it home and had it the next day, I am planning another trip down to Phoenix in April and will once again visit chen & wok."}
{"text":"OMG! This was such an amazing turn around experience that was had here. I have ordered before from this Chen & Wok and didn't think it was to great. Can't believe how much this changed my mind! 

Total price: $14 
Order: Spicy crispy pork, Chow mein, and Crab puffs. 

Spicy crispy: So fantastic! Amazing flavor and the perfect amount of heat. The only thing was the meat was more chewy than crunchy. 

Chow mein: Wow looks can be deceiving! The noodles didn't look that great but the taste was definitely there. It had like a soy sauce and light teriyaki taste with some possible oil. 

Crab puffs: These were really flavorful but didn't taste like a Chinese food crab puff. In addition, there wasn't really much crab on the inside. However, it was stuffed way more than most places and you got 6 for only $4. That's a great price! The breaking was perfectly crisp! 

Def go here! It was this good even 30 mins before closing. Now that's dedication!"}
{"text":"Coworkers decided to get take out from Chen & Wok as they deliver nearby. We ordered from the lunch special menu. We ordered Mongolian beef, chicken lo mein, Kung Pao chicken and shrimp, and spicy shrimp and vegetables. We all substitute steamed rice for fried rice. Ordering was easy and delivery was fast. Food still hot and tasted fresh. We all enjoyed our food and would order again. Now was it fine Chinese dining? No but decent enough if you're in the mood for fast Chinese food."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever ate at. Been going here for years since the place first opened. I highly recommend the House Fried Rice and the Mongolian Pork. The food just melts in your mouth. Very authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed to write this review as this place used to be one of my favorites. We ordered delivery from work and it took over an hour to deliver 5 miles and the food was not good. I take that back my friend enjoyed her orange chicken. However, my boyfriend got the Kung pao chicken and said he only ate it because he was hungry. I got curry chicken and it was the worst I've ever had. I ate enough rice to stop my tummy growling and actually threw the rest away and I love leftovers and am not a picky eater. So many better places around Surprise that are good, maybe it was a bad day, not worth the money."}
{"text":"Chen & wok has been a favorite of mine since I moved to the neighborhood. The food is good and it's made fast. Tonight i ordered For my family and asked for all white meat chicken. The lady called me back after i placed the order to confirm it. Well, i didnt realize she failed to mention the all white meat part, so when i showed up to get the food i double checked and they said i never told them i wanted white meat. Overall, they were kind of rude about it. I like the food enough to keep going back, but it was off putting. That's why i only gave 3 stars."}
{"text":"Really enjoy Chen Wok and appreciate how accommodating they are to vegetarians. My gf is vegetarian, so I always request that they don't use chicken broth with the assorted veggies and veggie lo mein. Lo Mein is always delicious. A previous commenter mentioned the smell outside, which is usually pretty bad, so just stay home put that out of your mind and order delivery!"}
{"text":"We have ordered take out multiple times & have always been impressed. Unfortunately there are exceptions to every rule. Delivery has always been within one hour except for this evening which took 2 hours. I understand being busy, but please inform the customer up front of any known delays."}
{"text":"Chen & Wok is a quick stop away from my house (but half way between there and my gym... dangerous!) so it's very convenient for me. The food here is good, standard Chinese take-out. It's definitely the best I've had in my neighborhood, so here my loyalties shall lay.

The best part of the menu is definitely the lunch menu. Huge selection, with generous portions at a smoking deal-- starting at $3.40 up to$3.95. It's perfect for my nearly empty pockets these days. I haven't been able to find another place that I can have a cheaper, more fulfilling lunch! I've found it's best to order before and pick up, otherwise expect a loooong wait especially during peak lunch times."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and ordered almond chicken and also egg drop soup.  The small lunch bowl has about 1\" of low grade grisly chicken, almonds and celery, the rest is rice. AFTER I told her I don't like rice. The soup is odd, with tofu and canned mushrooms. I smell some delicious garlic but I'm not tasting it anywhere.
Super hot food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love this place, eaten there a handful of times and have never been let down. Today was especially great. I called in on my way home from the mall to pick up an order, I had a little car trouble and after being stranded for about 45 minutes (bout an hour after I ordered) I had to call and cancel my order which I apologized profusely for. About another 45 minutes later I was rescued and back on the road, I called a made my order again, once more apologizing for the inconvenience. When I arrived I was greeted my a gentlemen and a women, the gentlemens first words were \"are you okay? Is your car okay now?\" He was genuinely concerned, also handed me an ice cold bottle of water free of charge. Mind you the temperature today was 119. Other than wonderful customer service the food is always piping hot and super tasty, I went with the shrimp lo mein and crab puffs. 5 stars doesn't cover it, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A simple, cozy little place with big portions that also delivers! The lemon chicken and chicken lo mein were great and tasty. The way they make their fried rice isn't my favorite but still good. We came in about 10 minutes after lunch ended (3pm) but they let us order off the lunch menu anyways which was very nice. Will be going back again or maybe taking advantage of their delivery service ($20 minimum)."}

{"text":"I've never dined at this restaurant, but my in laws love it so much that they order to go all the time. I wasn't feeling very good and I requested if they can pick me up egg drop soup and teriyaki chicken from Chen & Wok. It really was what I wanted and needed. The flavors are okay, the portions are generous, and it is cheap and quick."}
{"text":"Good basic chinese take out place.  The crab puffs and house chicken are my favorites.  The price is also great.  Large quantities of food per plate."}
{"text":"Food preparation has changed since my last review.Chen & Wok is one of my favorite chinese spots.I do work close to the location, which I come here at least twice a week."}
{"text":"Saw some misguided diners standing in line for this swill recently, and my heart broke for them. Again, if you have a living taste bud, run."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food in Phoenix? Well this place proved to me that it does exist. Their egg rolls are great, and they have the BEST Orange Chicken this side of the Mississippi.  Order from this place once - you will wonder why you didn't do so long ago."}
{"text":"I have loved this place since I was a kid. My father owns a company in the are and we used to go to lunch all the time. We still come in and we love the customer service and the food is awesome! 

Good portions and isn't over priced."}
{"text":"Literally the worst $13 for one meal I have ever sent in my life.  I had the sweet-and-sour chicken dinner for $12.73, it was literally so over cooked in Chewy I didn't eat a piece of it. So disappointed"}
{"text":"Love the sides! Egg drop soup, lo mein, and crab puffs are tasty. The fried food has gotten a little sloppy (super greasy, breading everywhere but on the chicken) over the years. Try the curry chicken for something different!"}
{"text":"Good, fairly priced Chinese. The egg drop soup was a little flavourless but the chicken (we got House and w/ broccoli) was good quality and both came with a pint of rice each. I'll come back to try more of the dishes."}
{"text":"Called 2 places closer to me before calling this place to try and get the lunch special before 3pm. They said lunch was already done even though they advertised lunch until 3 pm, needless to say they got a 1 star review from us. Called this place as my 3rd option just after 3 pm for lunch delivery and they were more than happy to deliver it. Fed a family of 5 for just under $40 with a nice tip for the delivery gal. Loved the sesame chicken and crab puffs, even received 3 egg rolls free for paying cash. Makes me wonder about these other places I called, I use to manage restaurants and would have been pleased with a $30+ order right before 3 pm. What gives? Either it's bad management or kids running the show that don't care about the stores well being. Anyways, 5 stars for this place!"}
{"text":"The day after my bad experience, I actually called and spoke to the manager. He was super nice and apologetic and told me he would make sure I didn't pay for my next order of broccoli. I decided that their house special chicken, the manager and the super nice delivery guy were too good to give up for one bad employee who is lacking in customer service. Hopefully she got some training. Did I mention how good the house special chicken is?? lol"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I went in today and notice they have remodeled the place. Very nice touches but the same great taste... 7yrs and counting."}
{"text":"The stars are mainly for the customer service. They get an A+ for that.
But I wasn't impressed with the food one bit.
I got an order of orange chicken and an order of lemon chicken. Neither gave any impression of that flavor. Both chicken entrees were drowning in a gel like substance. My daughter said the orange chicken had a teriyaki taste to it, and the lemon chicken....well....I can't put my finger on the flavor but I didn't taste a hint of orange or any citrus. It was just like a sugary gel poured over it.
I didn't really care for the rice either. If the rice was good, I'd consider giving the place one more try, with different entree choices."}
{"text":"One of the best places with delivery in the midtown/north central area. Curry Chicken is  a fave. Prices are great and the food is delicious. I've lived in the area for about 8 years and Chen & Wok is a great dinner when you don't feel like cooking. Online ordering through Yelp would make it easier - would give 5 stars if it was available!"}
{"text":"New to the area and decided to try this place based on Yelp reviews & proximity. I was not impressed at all; the food was very bland with little to no flavor. We ordered chicken lo mein, vegetable egg rolls, spicy beef, Kung pao chicken and house fried rice. The \"spicy\" beef was actually sweet, the Kung pao chicken was completely devoid of flavor and the house fried rice was okay. The chicken lo mein and egg rolls were the least offensive dishes...

I try to steer clear of chains like Panda Express but the food was so bad it made me wish I had gone there instead."}
{"text":"I went to this place when they first  opened up food was great and I was a regular customer  but as the years went on food went terrible  so I went elsewhere  well  I was nearby  here so I figured I'd give it another try but nope food was terrible and the rice was really dry I took it back and they redid my order and the same thing terrible I know I will not be going there again ever again and that a fact"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Oriental take-out in Boston, Massachusetts small shops with excellent food and service. We ordered the Chefs Special for 6 and once again were not disappointed. Pricing is fair and we'll worth what you get."}
{"text":"So consistent for 15+ years.

Their House Special Chicken is the best thing you will ever taste. It is quite possibly the most savage American style Chinese dish ever attempted. It's so savage, that it must be expressed in a French accent...Sauvage!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was good until I had their Egg-Foo Yong! Scary!!! How can you mess eggs up!!! 

There lunch specials are great and they get a lot of business, however, not everything on the menu is safe and trustworthy. You will get a few good items and then you begin to explore the menu until you bump into horrible! I was told this place use to be great....well its not horrible but great it is not!"}
{"text":"just ok, i usually feel like crap after eating here, but they deliver, and you always get a ton of food."}
{"text":"I will never order from this place again. Placed my order for delivery at 8:10pm. I was given a 1 hour time frame and was even asked to give the tip over the phone because they close at 9:00pm. Gave my address and was told they do deliver to my home. It is now 9:55pm and the food was just delivered. A phone call would have been nice. This is not acceptable. I will be calling the restaurant first thing in the morning."}
{"text":"Really like this place. My first time here, for lunch. Chose the lunch special: Lemon Chicken and substituted white rice with the vegetable Lo Mein. Everything was so delicious. Customer service was great as well; the woman working the cash register was just really nice. I decided to grab myself a drink as well; Total came to $7.82. Which is also a plus :3 Happy new year!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just got home from a long flight and wanted some Chinese for dinner on a Sunday night. Not wanting to go to a buffet and over eat bland dishes...we thought we'd try this local place. Well...I wish we didn't! Although I am going to give them two stars for the cleanliness and friendly greeting...that's about where it ends. I tried the cashew chicken and my wife tried the sweet & sour chicken. I refuse to order a drink from places that only serve cans of over priced soda, but my wife had a .99 cent can of 7UP. As for the food...my dish was way too hot (still steaming 15 mins later, the chicken at times had globs of fat on it, and every so often I would find bits of other dishes in it. I ate about 1/3 of my large order and threw the rest out. My wife thought her sweet & sour chicken was so-so, and the rice that came with our order was very dry and tasteless. I want to close with the menu had NO General Tao or Sesame Chicken! Two very common staples! In closing the place is clean, and people nice, but you can do much better for even average Chinese food."}
{"text":"My husband goes to Chen Wok every Friday noon for lunch and sometimes even on Saturday. His favorites are cashew chicken (a little extra spicy) and/or the lo mein noodles.  I like the chicken with vegetables and teriyaki chicken. We  also like their egg rolls.  The only thing I didn't care for so much was the sweet n sour pork.  The pork was tough and when I make this dish at home I throw in onions, green peppers and pineapple. Their version had none of that so I was a little disappointed.  Other than that, we love the food, the ice tea and the ladies at the counter are always nice and know us by name.  We need to try their crab puffs since I've just read that those are very good too."}
{"text":"Chen WACK is what I call it! I would have given it no stars if I could. This place has failed to meet the mark way too many times hence my review. I don't write about places to often good or bad but at this point I feel that if I can save someone time, money, disappointment, and sickness then it's my duty! This place lacks in the flavor department hardcore. 90% of the food is bland! It's just horrible in my opinion! They give you great portions but the quality is very lacking! Avoid this place at all costs! Unless you go in the back and help them season and marinate the food your getting plan on eating chinese that has no soul or flavor."}
{"text":"Love this place been fan since I lived in Peoria where they first started. I love the shrimp and beef with chicken, perfect for high protein diets just add veggies vs. Rice. The tofu is good too. We always get the steam veggies vs rice. My kids love the Orange chicken with low main. The delivery drivers are kind and always play with my kids too."}
{"text":"Love this place and they deliver! Our favorites are the Chicken Lo Mien, Sweet and Sour Chicken, and the Beef and Broccoli. Love using the online coupons over the phone for free items, especially the spring rolls, which they often double to be kind. Lots of great food for a reasonable price. Our whole family loves it. Best Chinese food in Surprise."}
{"text":"Food isn't that great. Seemed very greasy and everything had a peanut taste to it.

Tasted like everything was cooked in the same pan, wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their delivery is fast, the food is delicious and reasonably priced. The restaurant is not fancy but it is fast food so what do you expect. They pack so much fried rice in their containers you won't believe it. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"I got the Moo Goo Gai Peng and the House Special Lo Mein as take away.  It was great!  I was also excited to hear they deliver to my place so I'll be ordering them for delivery in the future."}
{"text":"Chen & Wok on 7th street is the best!  Not only are the prices super low ($3-$4 ) the portions are huge! My boyfriend and I have been going there forever, and have never once had a bad experience.  The owners are wonderful, and the food is delicious. The only issue I have ever experienced is order accuracy with deliveries, I think there is a slight language barrier that makes phone in orders difficult.  However, they are quick to hurry back with the correct order.  All in all, Chen & Wok is a great deal for amazing food!"}
{"text":"Large portions and average prices for any Chinese restaurant. Fast delivery but the food isn't that great. Shrimp Lo Mein had no flavor except for the shrimp which tasted like it came from a muddy pond or something. I also ordered the orange chicken which only came with minimal sauce on it. Some pieces didn't even have sauce on them. And the beef and Broccoli was super salty. Hopefully I just ordered on a bad day because this used to be my favorite place in the area"}
{"text":"I am new here to the state and the city. I come from California, and I've been living here for a month already. So I am starting to get to know this area a little bit better. I was craving Chinese food, and seen the restaurant while driving around, and it is really good! I am very picky with food, especially Chinese food. I ordered the orange chicken with white and brown rice. The pricing is fair but what you get for that price is wow. Let's just say my plate wouldn't close because of so much food that was in it. The food was freshly cooked and not just sitting there. I am definitely coming back. Also the owner is out and about helping customers, he seems really sweet! The workers as well are really nice!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and was to my 15 minutes quicker than quoted.  
Ordered sautéed spicey beef extra spicey.  It was excellent.  Only complaint is it could have been spicier.  No biggie.  
Egg rolls are tiny but good. 
Overall I'll order from them again."}
{"text":"Never will I ever return to this Restraint again!  I have had enough of it.. ive given Chen and Wok n. 7th st. 4 chances to purchase their food. Now for the 5th time I came in and ordered the same thing everytime and pick up and go home to eat.. however each time they mess my order up and I call they said they don't make mistakes! They are the most rudest people I've ever talked to. I don't need that in my Life! Even when they take your order and answer the phone they never ask how are you nothing.. nothing but a couple sourpusses!!!!! So I'm going to get the word out to my family friends a nd everyone I know!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food is always hot and delicious.  Lunch is a smoking deal, you can get 2 meals with low mien for under $12.00.  I normally use the delivery service and they are fast and reliable."}
{"text":"My go-to Chinese delivery in my neighborhood.  Good selection of the traditional favorites--have had the fried rice varieties, lemon chicken, huge tasty egg rolls, lo mein, mongolian beef.   Simple and tasty, with quick delivery."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, the fried rice is AMAZING its my favorite with extra egg... BUT the ladies at the register are rude . I'm pretty sure one got fired and they hired a new one and she's just as rude . The chicken needs to be a little bit more cooked as well"}
{"text":"Co-worker loves, and I mean LOVES Chen Wok, and has eaten it for almost an entire week before...I wouldn't go that far HOWEVER, it's cheap , fast Chinese food..and you get a massive plate of food!

First time, I had tofu and veggies in oyster sauce, rice and egg roll..just yummy especially the tofu was great and fried..yum!!

Today, just tried their house chicken, basically deep fried and over rice with sweet brown sauce..I would actually do it without the sauce or on the side and add some chili to it...but it was one of the many lunch specials and only $3.40ish, I had a drink and egg roll so it came out to be around $6..

I have to say you want something cheap but good.. try Chen Wok..get some veggies into your diet than the taco bell or McDonald's around the corner.."}
{"text":"They arrived 30 minutes before the expected delivery time and the food was pipping hot. The crab puffs and sweet and sour chicken were delightful. The person taking our order on the phone was also helpful with size recommendations."}
{"text":"It's ok, but I wouldn't drive across town for it.  I suspect delivery is a large portion of their business.  Atmosphere was pretty much a zero.  Broken windows covered with cardboard, (I hope that is temporary), simple set up with chairs and tables, soft drinks sold by the can only.   The food was hot and serving size ample, the orange chicken was just that with rice, (hey how about cutting back on the chicken and adding some sort of vegetable except rice)?  .  The orange chicken was good, but it didn't have any \"wow\" factor.  While waiting for my order it sounded like the entire kitchen staff was spanish........the counter help was friendly.  This place is close by my work and there really isn't much else around for Chinese/oriental food so this place will do when you have the urge for asian.  If it gets better I will update."}
{"text":"I have order delivery from Chen-Wok for years.  The food is really economical, and it comes right to your house.  For those of you whom expect food to be sizzling, freshly seared off a wok, be real.  This is take-out.  Chen Wok separates it fried items from the sauces so you get crispy morsels, with sauce to be poured over them.  (For example, sweet and sour chicken.  Sauce comes on the side so the coating on the chicken doesn't get soggy.)  In all the years I had one item missed (house fried rice), and the owner personally drove it to my home.  I've had the owner himself, as well as two delivery drivers (Linh and Justin) both whom were friendly and efficient.  Their food is quality.  The average deliver time is about 40 minutes.  Don't complain, just plan for an extra 10 minutes.  Order with confidence!

{"text":"I have ordered takeout from Chen and Wok three times now and each time there has been an error with my order. On my most recent visit the size of my dish was incorrect. I was given a small lunch portion even though I specifically asked for a large when ordering in person and the staff was not friendly about it. On the plus side they do have a fair amount of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for take out Chinese food! It's definitely a hole in the wall. I discovered this place when I moved in down the street from it lol. I decided to give it a try and not bad for fast Chinese food. I love their orange chicken, beef and broccoli, veggie low mein, and wonton soup. Their portions are big if you order of he large. 

Customer service is always great everyone is very friendly. I suggest ordering ahead of time over the phone so you don't have to wait there if you're taking out. Prices are reasonable for the portions they serve. 

All in all it does the job if you're craving fast chine"}
{"text":"As Chinese fast food goes it's not bad the food was fresh and the service was prompt and prices were reasonable. I would give it like a 3.5 stars but overall pretty average."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food at decent prices."}
{"text":"I read a bunch of these reviews and was nervous about trying Chen & Wok but figured I'd give them the benefit of the doubt.  We ordered delivery and the service over the phone was very friendly.  We ordered on a Saturday evening and knew it would probably take a long time so that was to be expected. They told us 45 minutes, but our food arrive short of 30 which is always awesome.  
     Maybe I'am spoiled from the million and one Chinese take outs from the east coast but the food was not that great here.  I wasn't expecting gourmet or anything but like the other reviews said the food was very greasy dripping from the boxes. Not the end of the world but the flavors of the veggies, chicken and other goodness were completely lost in this mix. It was like eating bland shapes of what looked like food that were propped up with sauces to make it taste somewhat real.  If they could tone down the oils and sauce by half their food would probably be amazing. Sorry guys but I won't be ordering here again. Hopefully they read some of these reviews and adjust their food a little bit. Best of luck."}
{"text":"Don't eat here unless you like food that has no taste.
Since this is in my neighborhood and I was craving some good Chinese food I stopped in yesterday for a take out lunch.  Since one of my favorites is cashew chicken I placed my order for the large size and took it home.
When I opened it all I could really see was celery.  I tasted it and YUK.  NO FLAVOR. All I could taste was half cooked celery.  This is not cashew chicken this is CELERY.  I have never in all my 40+ years tasted Chinese food that was this bad and had no flavor.  I tried to spice it up with my homemade hot Chinese mustard, soy sauce, sweet and sour sauce but nothing would help it.
A friend had warned me about the food but I thought I would just check it out for myself.  From now on I will believe what he tells me about food.
Waste of money, time, etc."}
{"text":"This place is just bad. We ordered large szechuan beef w/ pork fried rice, large orange chicken w/ pork fried rice and a small beef w/ broccoli w/ pork fried rice. Also grabbed some crab puffs. This still came out to over $50. 

The beef in my szechuan didn't taste like beef and was very mushy. The beef in the beef w/ broccoli tasted like bad pork for some reason. The Crab puffs were less than average. The orange chicken was mostly breading and was oddly salty. 

There isn't a single part of our meal we enjoyed or could possibly recommend. I live less than a mile from the location and it still took over and hour to deliver and I was told it would be less than 45 minutes.

Quick recap: Bad food, bad prices, slow delivery and a overall bad experience. I won't be back. I wouldn't  recommend them to anyone either."}
{"text":"OMG I just had lunch here and I have to say it was really good.  I really love Chinese food and have tried many places in town including upscale places and have  always been  disappointed because I either paid too much and  the food did not live up to the price and or the price may have been right, but horrible food.
Chen & Wok I have to say has really fancied my taste buds.  YUM!! 
Not only are their prices reasonable but their food tastes so much better than many other Chinese places I have been to in the Phoenix area.
I had the orange chicken take out dinner with nice size portions filled with amazing flavor that puts Panda Express to SHAME!!!  
Their egg rolls I have to say has been one OF THEE best I have had in a very long time!!   
I am for sure coming back for more very soon!!!"}
{"text":"You get a lot of food for your buck here! I'd recommend paying the $1 extra for white meat chicken. Friendly and fast service. Egg rolls are tiny but they are cheap. House chicken was just okay but orange chicken was great."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, if you make a purchase using cash, they'll give you free eggrolls so thats definitely a plus. I love the shrimp chow mein. All of the portions they give you are huge, I reccomend splitting several things amongst a group of friends or saving part of your meal for a different day."}
{"text":"I am not going to say this is the best chinese food i have ever had because i am from the NY/NJ area and been to many chinatowns across the world. But i will say happily that if you are hungry and in a hurry and want good chinese food delivered to your house in a hurry which is hot and tasty this is the place to go. I have called numerous times and never dissapointed not only for home delivery but for my wife when she works at the hospital. They answer the phone get the order right and if you want to save a few bucks i learned to order the lesspriced lunch menu at around 2 and eat it for dinner later saving big money and same ammount of food. Thats a secret so dont tell them i told you...lol. Marc from the central corridor area"}
{"text":"BEWARE! OILY NASTY MYSTERY CHICKEN! This place does not care about the quality of food they put out. EVERYTHING WAS WET WITH OIL - down to the crunch noodles. GROSS GROSS GROSS!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Terrible bland food. I had the shrimp in lobster sauce and the sauce was brown instead of white like it should be. I will never order from this place again. Really bad food, such a disappointment."}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal. This place is near my work so I often come here for lunch. Both me and my wife come on the weekend as well. They give you a ton of food so there are always leftovers which is a plus. Their lunch special is super cheap. $5 and some change for a big box which one entree and side. Sooooo good!!!!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years now. The food is made FRESH when you order it. I crave this place all of the time. It's a hole in the wall type of place with the best food ever.. fresh, hot, and delicious. I love their cashew chicken, kung pao chicken, curry chicken, fresh crab puffs. Their portions are big and the lunch specials are really inexpensive.. but I'd pay more if I had to! They have the option to add white meat only to your meal for $2.00.. it used to be $1.00 but  because of inflation everything has to go up so I understand.. can't be mad. I love all the veggies and sauce it almost all their meals! I just love their freaking food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The other locations don't make their food fresh.. don't be tricked! They are not as good as this location.. yum!"}
{"text":"Really good American Chineese food at a great price. Their lunch specials are about 5 bucks and you struggle to eat it all. I've never had anything but perfectly prepared, hot and tasty food from them. I usually get sesame chicken in the large lunch(you can sub lo mein for rice for $1) and I never finish it in 1 sitting. Definately my goto spot in Central Phoenix for quick delishious lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"chen&wok is simply bad fast food chinese...
no ambience....with a  horrible little chinese woman who takes orders and gives nasty looks and no customer service at all!

dont ever ask for anything like a plate or box to bring home leftovers or she will treat you like you are asking for the world!

the food isnt very good...the soup was aweful!

my rule of thumb is to always try a place twice...just to be sure it was not an \"off\" day...as we all have them...

but this time....i am going against my own rule and wont ever go back!!

the kratchity old chinese woman can stick that in her fortune cookie and eat it!"}
{"text":"Been ordering delivery from here for over ten years....  never been disappointed.  Until this week.  Phone number disconnected - haven't driven by to see if they are actually closed.  :-("}
{"text":"This restaurant is ideal for greasy Chinese food takeout and I mean that in the best way. They have THE BEST egg rolls, fried rice, veggie moo shu, crab puffs, sliced bbq pork, and things like that. Don't bother trying to eat there though... They have tables but no ambience--it's meant for pick up and delivery. 

But please listen to me and steer clear of things like wor wonton, kung pao, teriyaki chicken, beef & broccoli, and various seafood dishes. They don't do well with vegetables, their meats are really fatty and chewy (and if you up charge to white meat chicken, it's just dry).  

So if you want greasy crab puffs, and I often do, you will love Chen & Wok. But if you want light and healthy and high quality, you might want to pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"At one time this place was an outrageously good value. 

I used to work within a mile of Chen and Wok and it was a common lunch destination for a lot of people in my company. The quality was noticeably better than other strip-mall Chinese places. You could get the quality of a sit-down place from take out. That was the magic of Chen and Wok.

In the last few years it's become more or less equal to its competitors. You still get a lot of edible stuff for a little money, but it's just . . . edible stuff. . . . 

The only remaining advantage is delivery if you happen to be in the Cent Pho area, though their minimum order for delivery is now $15, and I think a charge applies."}
{"text":"I ate here twice and both times I was confused?  Was I eating Chinese food?  I was hoping this would be a great lunch stop, since its so close to my house.  With so much Chinese food restaurants to pick from this is one I avoid.  
I have to say the food is on the greasy side and the huge grease trap outside is evident from the alley on the side. 
Inside is very small with a few tables and supplies fill the back corner.  Not a pleasant place to sit and eat, take it home or on the go."}
{"text":"Really good cashew chicken. Everyone finished there plates. Nice people and good atmosphere. And very cheap lunch specials."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this food highly recommend it to the public it's better than panda express better than any Chinese food out there this food here is hot and fresh really hot everything they cook is fresh The food is so delicious I have so much menu please come check out Chen Wok On seventh Street and Maryland Phoenix Arizona"}
{"text":"Man, Surprise is really ripe for a great chinese place, however this is merely passable, not great.

I have never eaten inside here, so I can't compare to some other reviews about the interior.

I will give them credit first in that delivery was fast, I was quoted 45 mins it ended up more like 20, the driver was very friendly, and the prices were reasonable.

The food left a bit to be desired though.  Lots and lots of rice, and an ok amount in the \"large\" containers too.  

Everything had too much funky oil on it.   The S&S pork was ok but the pork was a bit overcooked.   We also had orange chicken, which was not the least bit spicy as the menu noted...in fact crappy panda is spicier thank this, which was disappointing.   The crab puffs were probably the most disappointing, not much stuffed in and it was not a pleasant taste or consistency.

I'd probably give this place one more try because the service was very good, but would order different items and hope for an improvement."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some lo mein or fried rice to go. Their crab puffs are awesome as well. I would not dine in since its like a cafeteria in there, like most to go places, but I dont know of a better chinese food place in Phoenix yet that has it all."}
{"text":"My first time here and it was a hit! I ordered take out-my favorite and was hoping for it to be what I used to have in Denver. It was better! Shrimp lo mein and egg drop soup. Fresh and flavorful! This is my go to chinese fix from now on! The only thing not too appealing was the actual restaurant-small and hardly any decor. Might just always have it to go, too bad they don't deliver in my area."}
{"text":"Update 2/21/2018 after a bad experience my work landed me in the area so I remember how good the lunch special was. So I said screw it let's give it a shot. People my exp was a total 360 degree the lunch special is were it's at. Orange chicken large w/ lomein noodle and side order of pint white rice. It was very good about $9.00 that was a decent price and quality. 

My last exp I ordered dinner after the lunch special so my bill was super high like 50 plus dollars and matching that price to the taste didn't match up. I  recommend  using the lunch specials to your advantage. The basic pricing without special can be extreme in$ to feed a family."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff. Wish they delivered to my house, but we can't have it all. :-) The lo mein has a good flavor and the house chicken is delicious (and a bit spicy). One thing that needs to change is the egg rolls. I am used to larger, fried egg rolls.These are more like spring rolls. I will be returning for takeout!"}
{"text":"You always know good Chinese food when the people in the kitchen are telling jokes in Cantonese.

You know how good it is?  It's SO good, when I took my visiting parents, my dad actually stopped eating, went to the counter, and complimented the chef.  Now that's good.

The best menu item by far is the lo mein.  It doesn't matter which one, they have chicken, pork, shrimp, or just veggie.  It's not overly oily, and that luscious aroma from using a wok just can't be beat.  You feel healthy and naughty all at the same time.  

Every time I get an urge for good Chinese food and don't feel like cooking, that's where I head!"}
{"text":"So I have been going to Chen & Wok for years. Getting the same thing. Sauteed spicy beef and teryaki chicken. Prices have only slightly risen over the decade to this market I have paid tribute too. 
Honestly, get take out. The restaurant is not great for privacy, nor has it been upgraded in any major way. But it does not matter. Get the take out. Enjoy it at home. 
Also, avoid other chen and woks around the valley. It is not the same. 
My only recent concern is the transition from large styrofoam bowls for lunch to segregated trays that keep the meat from the rice. I like the rice immersed in my spicy sauce. Combining them is a hassle and messy.
The dinner is better, with the rice and meat in its own respective carton. 

I should try new things here but I have rarely been disappointed with my order."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since 1996 I was a freshman in high school! Everything I have ordered has always been hot and fresh! The staff for the most part are kind and very helpful if you need any special requests! I love the Chicken Fried Rice with their special hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck in Phoenix. The food is great and doesn't leave you feeling like you've sacrificed quality just to save a few bucks.  My husband and I get take out from Autumn Court quite often....2 entrees and an app = $30 bucks every time. 2 large lunch entrees at Chen & Wok is $10 bucks and we always leave satisfied. The portions are large enough to have leftovers for later. Ooooo and the crab puffs are oh so yummy."}
{"text":"BEWARE******Used my Credit Card on 5/14/12 Lady walked away with my card to the back of the Restaurant while I stood at the counter and 2 days later the FRAUD team from my bank called to confirm hundreds of dollars of purchases at Rite Aid location in California******someone copied my card and purchased Gift Cards.  My bank indicated my Credit card was cloned with a different name.    This was the only place this could have happened.  Had not used this credit card in over 4 months.  My bank clearly indicated that my card was swiped using an identity theft machine."}
{"text":"I really like this place! It's small but I don't expect a grandiose atmosphere like some of the reviewers obviously wanted.  Like one said \"Go to P.F Changs for that\".  I love the food here and the people! They are very nice and after you've been there a couple of times, they remember you.  Even when placing a phone order!  I have the house chicken, which is FANTASTIC! It is spicy but not so much that you can't even enjoy it.  They give you big portions, so one lunch special for $5.00 is enough for 2 servings.  $2.50 a serving?!? You can't beat that.  I can't really say anything about the oiliness of the food, since I do not find mine to be oily at all.  The food ALWAYS comes out HOT!  Some much so, that it can not be eaten right away. Never have I gotten my food in 2 seconds as one reviewer did and I eat there often.  If you are looking for good food that is not over priced and just want to eat and not worry about all the decor and what not, then you should give it a try!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre Chinese, basic Americanized stuff. Which in general would be fine but the orders are never right. Size is wrong, or items are mixed up. Seems to be some fixation with shorting people on mustard. A suggestion would be to just have an option of chef's choice. Give them some money and they pick what you get. Not all of this can be blamed on a language issue....."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  Saw good reviews on Yelp, so we gave them a call.  I'm not really into Chinese food, but have LOOOOVED every dish I've gotten here.  Even as leftovers.  
I've stuck to the shrimp menu so far and can give 5 stars to their Cashew Shrimp and Shrimp with Snow Peas.  My husband tried the Kung Pao Chicken, which he liked a lot, and the House Chicken, which he said was just 'good'.  Cashew Shrimp has a tasty sauce and water chestnuts - yummy.  I wanted more veggies with my dish this time, and the Shrimp with Snow Peas delivered.  Snow peas, bamboo shoots, carrots, mushrooms, and good-sized tasty shrimp - oh, my!
Super cheap, super fast (avg. 20 min delivery), and suuuuper tasty!!!!"}
{"text":"The pork fried rice just may be the best in town. Definitely one of the meatiest. Great delivery service. Friendly employees."}
{"text":"I moved from California in 2006 and found this place a few blocks from my home. In Cali, I was used to finding mom/pop Chinese food places at virtually every other corner....they were always better than those chain fast food Chinese places that one finds everywhere here. So, finding this place was a blessing a nice way to quickly feel right at home!

My favorite dish from here is the Orange Chicken. One thing to note about this place, is they cook every dish, no matter how small right when you order. Their slogan is gourmet Chinese food! And you can tell everything is cooked fresh. The Orange Chicken has actual orange slices in it, along with some red chili peppers, no worries, they are pretty dry, so none of the seeds actually get into the Orange Sauce.  I have had just about everything on their lunch & dinner menu, and you cannot go wrong with anything from here.

For lunch they have small bowls starting @ $3.49 and bigger size at $4.49. Add a .99 cent drink, you are set. When I worked at American Express, we would order from here at least once a week, and they have delivery within a certain radius and purchase minimum. 

Overall, I love this place! Anyone that comes visit and is in the mood for Chinese food gets taken here. It's a fast food place but OMG their food and prices are amazing!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to fast food restaurant. I love the food the portions are big and it's always hot. The only complaint I have is the fact that they need to redecorate. It's a clean restaurant but it needs to be updated with new tables chairs and Booth."}
{"text":"Seriously the best egg rolls I've had.  Huge and full and filling.  The house special lo main was fantastic.  We will keep going that's for sure."}
{"text":"Yep, still darn good.  We ordered take out this week and it was just as good as always.  i wish that I had a Chen & Wok in my hood in Chicago.  Why is their lo mein so much better than everywhere else?"}
{"text":"Surprise for a city of 100,000 people has a lack of good restaurants.  Most of the decent ones are chain restaurants that are predictable but nothing great.  Chen Wok is an exception to the rule.  I have yet to be disappointed by a meal from them, whether it is dine-in or take-out.  The owner and his wife are usually there and greet customers like family.  Repeat customers will find that they are remembered.  If one has ordered the same thing twice, they can usually repeat the order from memory.

They do not own a steam table; every dish is cooked to order.  They are more than willing to make adjustments to fit your personal preferences.  I am a vegan; they will even leave out the egg in their soups so I can eat them.  I also love spicy food; I order the Ma-Po Bean Curd extra extra spicy (actually the way to word it is, \"As Hot As Possible.\") and have never been disappointed.  My wife orders Teriyaki Chicken but has a sensitive stomach, so they accommodate her by going light on the sauce.  Their menu is varied enough that my kids can order whatever strikes their fancy at the time.

Some of the pervious reviewers disparage Chen Wok for being small with \"Costco Tables.\"  If one wants atmosphere, then go to P. F. Chang's and pay triple for half the food.  Chen Wok is fine example of the small independent American business.  They deserve your support and patronage a hell of a lot more than the McDiarrhea's in the parking lot.  I gave them 5 stars because of value and quality and taste.  I can live without the pretentious of atmosphere."}
{"text":"We know good oriental food when we taste it and Chen and Wok is not good food. Most oriental food is not overly greasy and this food was way over greasy.  We ate 2 bites and toss the 2 dinners out into the trash. The shrimp was over fried and very brown. 
The noodles had scorched edges.  Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food , great service at a great price! There delivery is really fast and they always have a smile! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Not really \"gourmet\" Chinese, but it is good. We have ordered from them several times now, and have not been disappointed. We have tried a variety of choices from the menu, they're all good. Choose what sounds best to you and I'm sure you'll be satisfied. No, it's not the best Chinese food we've ever had, but we do like it. We will continue to order from them as long as we're in this area. We always get delivery."}
{"text":"Really good veggie lo-mein. That was what my friend ordered. I had the teriyaki chicken. The teriyaki sauce was really good, the chicken was a little grisselly and WAY too huge of pieces. It would be nice if they had cut it up a bit more. The gal at counter was super nice and accommodating. Thumbs up for good service!  I'll be back to try a few more options!"}
{"text":"Sunday after church tradition! LOVE lunch portion of cashew chicken all white meat and best crab puffs in town!"}
{"text":"Dont let the terminally sad interior of this dive fool you - the kitchen's consistency and quality control is top notch.  Chen & Wok's dozen or so ricebowl lunch specials (served before 5PM daily) brimming with meat and vegetables - each priced under $5 - are truly one of this town's culinary bargains. Less of a bargain at dinner. 

I'm partial to the chicken curry bowl - succulent stir fried chicken with huge chunks of al dente carrots, onion and green pepper topped with an addictive thin sauce packing medium heat (not that tasteless thick, floury gravy goop passing as \"curry\" in so many fast food places). They get their chicken (or at least they used to) from Firpo Poultry Farm, and I think it's a step up from meat used at some other rice bowl joints.  Delicious and remarkably consistent.  

Soups are served very hot (temperature) and are therapeutic on a cold or rainy day.  Take out orders are always packed up securely with plenty of condiments and utensils.

My teenaged son and I eat here semi-regularly and have a good time, slurping our food and people watching, but you'll wanna stay clear of the \"dining room\" if you're on a date or trying to impress anyone. I think they're trying to finally spruce it up a little, but it's got a ways to go before I would dine in with a genuine guest (ie stranger).

EDIT: Nov 29 2010

They've painted the place, put in new tables and chairs and even hung a couple pictures. You can officially eat here with a woman now!!"}
