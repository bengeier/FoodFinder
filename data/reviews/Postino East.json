{"text":"$5 wines and beer 11-5 every day. We love their bruschetta, one order is enough to fill up my fianc√© and I."}
{"text":"Hate to rain on the parade but our experience tonight at the Gilbert location was disappointing.  We have been to the Arcadia location many times and count it as one of our favorite eating destinations in Phoenix. However, a combination of problems added a sour note to an otherwise nice evening.  

The first problem -- apparently the kitchen lost track of our salad -- would have been understandable for a new operation.  Plus, to their credit, Postino did not charge for the salad.  However, our server compounded the problem by trying to close our bill while we were enjoying our meal culminating with her giving us our check before I had finished eating said salad.  Not only did we feel rushed out of the restaurant but we had intended to order dessert!

I have always admired the wait staff at the Arcadia location for their professionalism that seemed to support a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience. The Gilbert location stumbled on both accounts.  We'll assume this new operation will resolve these bugs and hope to return to this location.  Afterall, the bruschetta is delicious, the wine list is extensive, and the yet-to-be-tried salty caramel sundae is too enticing to avoid."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this postinos I always get great service! Sometimes the wait is long but totally worth it! I recommend any of the bruschetta!!"}
{"text":"Overrated!!  I'm not going to give this place lower than a 3 because it didn't totally disappoint, but there are definitely better wine bar/restaurant/lounges. 

I can't comment on the service with the exception that my date had the wrong salad brought to her. They corrected the situation, but not until we said something. The waiter made a comment that he knew that wasn't what she ordered, but still didn't correct the situation before giving her the wrong dish. Other than that, it was busy, so I didn't expect exceptional service, but it was good.

The wine list was great, not a great deal after their 5pm happy hour, but a good selection. 

My issue was the food. We both got salads, as mentioned before. The salads are small, and around $11. I added $3 chicken to mine for protein, and it was deli meat, and very little of it. I have no issues with prices, as nobody should when going to a wine bar, but expect to receive something comparable in value; this was not worth the $14-15 salad, nor was the complete dinner worth $60 after tip. I may go back for the happy hour, but not the food."}
{"text":"OMG, my mouth was in heaven last night ! Came here for the first time, on my birthday. Food was amazing, service was amazing, loved the atmosphere....such a wonderful birthday experience. My favorite place to have a yummy meal has always been The Melting Pot, but now I am hooked on Postino's. As a vegetarian I was so happy with the bruchetta plate and salad that we had. I can't rave enough. Only issue is that it's pretty far from my house, so I may have to try the one in Tempe, next time. Hope it's just as great !!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  amazing good and always great wine, we have never waited long to be seated as hey are usually quick to seat you. Will definately continue to go back!"}
{"text":"The service here was not great. It was a Saturday evening so I understood that they were busy and that things can take longer but it took a half and hour to get our drinks to us. Refills were not given until almost the end of our meal even though our glasses were empty before we got our food. The food was mediocre to the four of us. The bread on my sandwich was cold rather than heated as described and dried out. While it was not a horrendous experience it would not be my first choice in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"I love this place I have been several time and each time I go the food is great. They have a large selection of wines and service was awesome. We were told there would be a 30 min wait and that only ended up being 15 min sat outside the weather was perfect and all us ladies had a great time."}
{"text":"Go for the happy hour -- $5 glasses of good wine on a lovely patio are always the best way to spend an afternoon! The wine selection here is always excellent, especially the whites -- I'm normally a red wine drinker but at Postino I feel confident branching out to the pale side.

As for food, I've never tried a bruschetta here I didn't like, it lives up to its reputation. I also recommend the brunch on weekends: the menu is somewhat small but the choices are delicious -- I've had the farm scramble and also the walnut bread with brie and jam is to-die-for.

This being an Italian sort of menu, there isn't much in the way of gluten-free options, but if all you can have is wine, there's nothing wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my girlfriends and it was delicious!!!! Had some of the best bruschetta I have ever had! Our server was a sweet heart who delivered excellent service! Everything was so relaxing drank some wine it made for a perfect evening! I will def be back!"}
{"text":"Seems to be a classy new wine bar in Gilbert...food was good an patio is nicely laid out!"}
{"text":"I needed to have a buffet-style layout for 10 hungry adults following a long day of work and wow, did Postino in Gilbert come through. And this was with very little notice just after the Thxgvg wkd, I confess!

Platters of their amazing bruschetta, exotic organic veggies abound, home-made hummus, delicious salads, breads, and wow, the cookies even stunned! Everyone was really impressed by how beautiful and high-quality the food presentations were. 

Thanks also to catering specialist Natalie Kell, who helped us mercifully on very short notice.  The Upward team clearly is a very professional outfit, committed to great people, policy, making great quality, tasty food, keeping it fun and affordable all the while. Kudos to you, Postino & Team!

{"text":"Got a great thing going always excellent service! Good wine selection. Food is just ok works for what it is but is way more about the wine and atmosphere and service then food options available. Still tasty but for  foodies just....hmmm."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Awesome service. Loved the atmosphere and laid back vibe. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS VALLEY SPOT!!!

My wife and I have been coming here ever since we were dating (phoenix location) and it never disappoints. Now, we don't drink, but the food is impeccable. We always want to try one of their paninis but we inevitably always go for the cheese board and bruschetta board . . . it's our \"go-to\". 

The waiters are awesome! There's no dress code so they're all dressed differently and super chill! Also, we have never been gotten the stink face for not drinking. 

All in all, the food is really good and unique, really cool vibe, great waiters.

FOUR STARS!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience tonight at Postino East.  Having been to all Postino locations, we have to agree with our awesome server Rachel, that the East location is the best.  She very confidently stated this fact when she came to our table and introduced herself and by the end of our meal, we had to agree 100%.  She was super fun and the support staff was outstanding - our water glasses never got below half empty ; ) Great teamwork.  We had the always amazing bruschetta and made a subtle suggestion to improve one of the choices and the chef was so gracious, came out to talk to us and gave us a great deal!  It doesn't get any better!  While we are both from central Phoenix and just happened to be in Gilbert dog sitting for friends, we might just have to make the drive put again when we need our bruschetta fix! Kudos!"}
{"text":"Awesome bruschetta boards and wine! Pruscuitto fig and mascarpone is a must! Also awesome environment to hang out with friends or for a date. 

Service was extremely friendly and accommodating. We came in after the kitchen had closed but they were so kind to still make us our bruschetta board! 

Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, it's really cute, great to go with friends and have a nice time talking and drinking wine ;), the food portions are really big, you can go there and enjoy the happy hour specials or to have dinner. the staff is really great too and prices are alright!"}
{"text":"Happy hour from 12-5 is a great value.  Food is delicious; I especially love the bruschetta!"}
{"text":"Came in to Postino East for lunch and had a great time! Jason was the bartender and was super awesome. He was very friendly and genuine. Also had a chance to talk to Johnny the manager who came by to check on me and make conversation. I felt like everyone was really on top of things and made the experience great! My turkey panini and Hannahs salad were prepared awesome and tasted just as good as they looked. Will be back again soon!!"}
{"text":"Nothing crazy fancy but that is the beauty of this place because everything is so, so good! So good that it definitely deserves my 5 star review! Clean, hip, and friendly atmosphere also."}
{"text":"What a great experience!  Our server, Bethany was extremely helpful with menu  alterations to accommodate my wife's egg, wheat, and dairy allergies. We ended up ordering a couple of bruscheta items served on tomato slices instead of bread and humus in place of the cheese.  We would never have thought of those alternatives, but the end result was fantastic!  No compromise on flavor or presentation. 
 
A second challenge for Postino's on this occasion (met equally well BTW) was our time constraint. We had tickets for a play at the Hale Theater, next door, and due the the long wait to get seated we had less than an hour to order and dine. I had called the night before and had been told Friday evenings could be very busy around 5 pm; was advised to arrive earlier if we wanted to be finished dining by 7. We arrived at 5:15 and immediately regretted not heeding the advice.  We waited a little over an hour to be seated. I told Bethany about our time crunch and she handled it incredibly well.  She didn't get flustered or irritated. She calmly and patiently explained options to accommodate allergies and delivered our meal very quickly.

OK, we also appreciated the atmosphere/ambiance/decor etc. but I will leave that to other reviewers. Thought it was worth mentioning the special treatment we got, especially with the allergen challenges."}
{"text":"Good drink specials and yummy appetizers, great music playing and very attractive servers - could not complain a bit!  They were really nice and accommodating to our large group.  Really nice day at this place.  Wish they had their misters installed though!"}
{"text":"For many years Gilbert residents joked about the corner being cursed because so many restaurants had failed soon after opening at the location. That all ended when Postino moved in. With a couple of other locations in the valley, their tried and true business model has allowed them to thrive since opening.  

For me, there's nothing not to like about the place. Their menu is not overly large, but everything I've tried has been delicious and the portion size generous. The prices are so reasonable I allow myself to tip generously and leave feeling like a \"big shot\". The staff is young and hip looking and the way they hustle is impressive. I've never been there without a manager checking in with me to make sure everything is satisfactory (a nice touch that is a rarity nowadays).

I normally time my visits to avoid the lunch and dinner crowds when indoor seating is at a premium. The large pleasant patio areas have misters providing cooling during the warmer times of the year. I prefer being seated outside in all but the summer months. 

This is a place where there are no banks of blaring large screen TVs undermining the pleasant convivial atmosphere. Postino is not a sports bar. There are more of those in Gilbert than the market can support. Postino's recognition of that fact is probably one of the main reasons why they found success where all their predecessors on the \"corner of doom\" failed. Postino's success has fueled the development of a food and entertainment district in Gilbert's old town area that I believe is making Gilbert a destination comparing favorably to anywhere else in the valley."}
{"text":"Great location, pretty fun place, great wine selection, food isn't amazing but above average. Service tends to be pretty good, so far servers/bartenders have been friendly and accomdating. The challenge is that you have to be really careful downtown Gilbert. One drink = DUI. I don't speak from personal experience but you see people getting pulled over all the time on Gilbert Rd and if you ask around its overly strict. Don't consume more than one drink especially if you're on an empty stomach. That's the problem with this place. The food is light and it's just OK, strength is in wine. If you go here expect to take an Uber or bring a DD. And the good news is there's plenty of other restaurants to choose from for decent eats right next to Postino."}
{"text":"Great place, the outdoor seating is amazing. The staff is very helpful and attentive. Great wine list and the cheese platter is fantastic."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  The $5 dollar bottle wine is the best on happy hour.  Brochette is way good to."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on March 27 and was part of a large group of 10 and was very pleased with the meal and the service.  The wait-staff were really first rate and very attentive to all of our needs.
My chicken salad was very tasty.  I liked my panini..but it lacked a little in taste.  There was a little mistake on one of our orders, but managment brought over a plate of chicken salad to sample while waiting for the order to be corrected....GREAT customer service!
It is so pleasant to have such nice service...especially when you consider the \"herd you in\" and serve yourself service that is offered in establishments on two other corners of this intersection.
Good luck Postino!"}
{"text":"Wow. I'm definitely going to be re-visiting this place.

-The food:
My group ordered a few plates of bruschetta to share, and I tasted the apple/brie, mozzarella/tomato, and fig. 
First of all, I love the plating - it looks good and is very functional and easy to share. Everything was truly delicious and professionally prepared. 

-The service:
We were lucky enough to be there when it wasn't busting at the seams, although it was still crowded as usual. Nevertheless, we were seated promptly and given attention right away by a helpful and cheerful waitress. The food arrived shortly and re-fills were covered well.

-The atmosphere:
It was a beautiful day- which helps, but on top of that, it was clean and comfortable where I was seated, and I personally loved the music selections. It's a very hip and happening kind of place with good style."}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out with friends. Pretty popular and very busy on the weekends. Had a lot of fun there and would recommend it."}
{"text":"One of my wife's favorite places. Unfortunately it's always packed but that means everyone else loves it too! Great wine and little bites of food to eat!!"}
{"text":"I love Postino! Great happy hour specials and the ever changing wine selection allows me to try great wines outside of what I normally drink.  I recently attended a Rockin Yoga session in the courtyard and it was a lot of fun! I'm really hoping they continue to offer that!!"}
{"text":"I recently went to postino east for my anniversary and my night was ruined by a few workers. There was a hostess who yelled at us for being seated too soon because friends of ours offered us their table since they found a seat at the bar. This was followed by us having to explain ourselves to a manager on why we took this table on a wait. We already had chairs at the open seating bar so what's the difference of taking up two seats at the bar or two seats at a table? If they had no intensions of moving us from the table, why even approach us and attack us? I will not be going back to this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the DT Gilbert scene. Breezy, open bar and dining area make for a casual vibe with metro decor - perfect for a meet up with friends. $5 wine by the glass til 5pm is a super deal. There was a good variety of wines to choose from and the bruschetta platter was tasty. Nothing earth-shattering in terms of originality but savory, well-balanced topping combinations like the tart sheep's milk cheese with sweet-tangy tomato jam. Bar service was super friendly too so it made for an all-around positive experience."}
{"text":"Ok food but clearly a popular place to be seen. Bartender cool but staff kind of rude. Not worth all the hype. Dont get people waiting an hour to get in. Also dont understand why no liquor.."}
{"text":"Great spot, usually busy and a line waiting most evenings but it is worth it.  Especially on Mondays/Tuesday's when they have their $20 Brushetta and wine special.  Friendly staff offers great recommendations.  Favorite date night place in Gilbert"}
{"text":"Went with my wife and the service and food was amazing. Highly recomend."}
{"text":"There's always a wait on weekends but you expect that at such a simple but great place. The bruschetta boards are amazing!!!! Salads are also really good."}
{"text":"Amazing!! The wine, dessert, bruschetta, sandwiches the salads I mean everything I have tried is delicious!!"}
{"text":"This wine bar is so romantic! It has wonderful service and the atmosphere is so relaxing. Wine selection is impressive and the bruschetta is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of my favorites and they have all my favorite wines with a lot of good selection! A good place to meet friends especially on a Monday."}
{"text":"Postino's in Gilbert was stunning! Amazing outdoor/indoor chic atmosphere.  Food and wine were excellent as expected! What another great addition to the Postino family! Loved it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The perfect blend of upscale dining and casual atmosphere. You can choose to sit inside, at the bar, on the patio, or even out in the grass. 

Great appetizers. We like to make a whole meal out of them by picking a few different bruschettas and maybe a sandwich. 

And you must try the cucumber, honey limeade. So refreshing!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place! Delish food, fabulous location and ambiance. I would suggest it for an adult environment only, but I am a bit picky about children in some restaurants."}
{"text":"Always great service.  
Nice atmosphere.  
Simple and delicious menu.  
Plenty of wine to choose from.  
A great place for my girlfriends and I to go after work.  
Need I say more?  :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service!
We went to Celebrate our anniversary ; we tried sitting at the bar , but the music was a bit too loud. I asked the hostess if she could move us , and she found us a more intimate table outside. The service was amazing , and they treated us to a complimentary dessert! The food was delicious ; enjoyed the 5$ glass wine! Will certainly be back !"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to this place. My friend and I came here during dinner time around 5:30. Place is nice and had a good ambiance. We got seated right away. I ordered honey cucumber lemonade which is refreshing and my friend ordered Arnold Palmer. My friend and I decided to order the bruchettas and butcher's block. For the bruchettas, we ordered the apple and fig, salmon and capers, warm artichoke dip and prosciutto and marscapone. They were delish and tasty. The butcher block is also tasty especially the hummus.
When we got the check, my friend told me that I got charge twice for my drink. Wow. The waiter did not mention that my drink wasn't free refill. I didn't mind paying but next time the waiters/waitresses should let the diners know that some drinks are not free refill. So when they get the tab, they won't be surprise. 
Overall, food and ambiance was good."}
{"text":"Love this location! The service is always oustanding! The manager Jeff always stops by our table to make sure everything is perfect. The food and wine is delish and very reasonable! Highly recommend trying the Seasonal bruschetta!"}
{"text":"Came for an early dinner with my sister.  Was a bit loud but the music selection was great.  They have a smaller menu, but not to small.  Wine selection was good too. Great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon for a quick lunch.  Sat outside.  The bruschetta was great (perhaps a wee bit overpriced, but tasty none the less), but I'm giving them 2 stars for service and atmosphere and I think I'm being generous since my experience was so annoying.  We sat directly under one of their speakers and they had this funky (to me kind of aggravating for a Sunday afternoon) music up so loud.  We asked them kindly if they could turn the music down and informed them we were not going to be there long since we were on a time crunch.  When it wasn't turned down, we asked again and was given a little attitude about it; it was never turned down.  For the 15-20 minutes we were going to be there, they could have accommodated and turned it down.  Honestly, the music was so loud it was making the experience very annoying.  We ate as quickly as we could just to get out of there.  If I go back, I'll get take out."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of all things food related and was extremely excited to try this place! I have heard nothing but amazing things about them, and how they are known for their paninis and bruschetta (which I really wanted to try)! I will commend that they have decently priced food and wine which was a huge plus, however the menu was also limited to few selections so I would have definitely preferred a wider variety of foods to try. I ended up settling on ordering a Roast beef panini and my friend ordered the chicken Mozzarella, I will not deny that my expectations as well as my friends were rather high, but the delivery was far below meeting it. The ciabatta bread was baked nicely and was so fluffy, and with the meat it was savory but only if these were eaten separately, when placed together in a sandwich it resulted in a vary bland and tasteless combination. The chips were no better, (I believe the intention was to season to taste) even with the adding of salt and pepper, it was still rather hard and bland as well. In the end we ate a less than mediocre meal at a decent price, with mediocre service (our server never once came to check on us, we saw the water boy more than him). I believe for some this is a great place! However, I prefer my food to be flavorful and excite my tastebuds rather than leaving me with a desire to drive another 5 extra miles to in-and-out and order a double double to erase the rather disappointing experience."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but the service is terrible. Waitresses and hostesses are inattentive, slow, and more interested in chatting with each other than doing their jobs."}
{"text":"Postinos....Patrick is the BEST!!! His recommendations  are spot on and everything was great.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have been hearing great things about this place but had not had a chance to check it out until last weekend. OMG, this place is great! Their food tastes fresh and the portions leave you full with enough to take home if you choose to. They have some of the most unique selection of wines and all the staff is very knowledgeable. My girlfriend is a beer geek and was uber impressed with the craft selection.    

What impressed me most was the staff. Not only was everyone friendly and knowledgable but they really appeared to enjoy working! They seemed to work as a unit. It felt like we had a whole team waiting on us hand and foot aiming to please us. We have been to many restaurants and never felt so welcomed."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing!! They have a nice wine & beer selection with average prices. If you come in before 5pm, you can get a pitcher of beer for only $5! They have an awesome $10 deal where you can get half a panini + soup or salad, the great thing about that is that it's ANY panini and ANY salad on the menu. For desert, I had the creme br√ªl√©e, it was delicious except half of the sugar crust was burnt, I had to remove it, for that I had to take off one star. Besides that, our waitress was great, she checked on us a few times, but not to many times, it was perfect. Super chill atmosphere, I definitely recommend this place to anyone, whether you live here or out of town!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I spend way too much time and money here but the food is great, the wine is plentiful, and the servers are quick and nice. It's also a really fun atmosphere. I've been on dates here, had girls' nights here, and even took my dad here for a nice Sunday lunch. (They even have live music Sunday afternoons!) And you definitely can't beat their board and bottle deal. Yum!"}
{"text":"Friendly people and tasty food. Except once I did come with my two daughters who are 2 and infant age. They were not rowdy at all but we got little service and the wait staff wasn't attentive to us. But the tables around us were getting loads of attention. But that was one time out of the handful I've been. Won't deter me from coming back"}
{"text":"Just finished my birthday lunch here. Been here a dozen times..this time..service was horrible, beer came out warm and we had to send up flares to get the attention of someone to replace it. Ordered Brussel sprout salad and there was literally 1/2 a Brussel sprout...had to ask the server to comp. thought this would be a nice place for lunch.  Won't be back.  Too many other great options."}
{"text":"Brushetta is great and is great place to hang with friends. Can be a little wait but is still worth it. I always get the brushetta with 2 salmons,1 salami, and a mozzarella, basil, and tomato. Also couch is so comfy while you eat brushetta."}
{"text":"Great food as always thanks postino"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast/brunch today.  It was horrible.  Scrambled eggs were cold and tasteless.  Potatoes were like dog chewies.  You could break a tooth on the toast.  All this for $24 for 2 people.  Could have had a much better breakfast at MCDonalds for half the price.  I gave it a second star because the wait staff is always attentive and pleasant.  The cook staff really needs to go back to cooking school.  The atmosphere is great, but can't say the same for what comes out of the kitchen.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for hanging out with friends or family.  Good wine and beer selection that changes with the seasons; also good food."}
{"text":"This was my first Postino's visit.  I had heard about it (the other locations) and I had a friend visiting from out of town and suggested this.  I love this style of eating - charcuterie, small bites and vino!  The Butcher's Board was absolutely delicious.  It has this white cheddar cheese (sounds boring, but it wasn't!) that was AMAZING along with sausage, sweet pickles, giant corn nuts and warm, soft pretzel sticks with honey-mustard dip.  Omg ... was in love.  The bruschetta was also tasty as was the salad (had the spring mix with walnuts, pear, etc).  Really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere is cute, hip and inviting.

My only two non-positive comments are that the music is really too loud to have a conversation except with the person right next to you and the servers should really ask if you're done with your food before they try to take your plate away. :)

I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Went on sunday evening sat in the patio area misters were on so it was OK. still a little uncomfortable given that it was still around 103 outside. Ordered the bruschetta and a butcher's block to share for 2 people. the butcher's block was average, decent meats but not impressive. the bruschetta on the other hand was amazing and delish. ordered 4 glasses of wine 1 white and 3 reds cant remember the names. total came out to $87 bucks including tip.. 

Would recommend going during happy hour (11-5pm) for half priced wine or go on monday & tuesdays for the $20 bruschetta & a bottle of wine. Will I be back during those discounted days? absolutely! any other day of the week, probably not."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! AMAZING bruschetta! Fantastic wine!!!! The atmosphere is great! Indoor an outdoor seating that is comfortable! They even have outdoor heaters to make it even more enjoyable during the cold months! Try the vanilla creme br√ªl√©e too... Just Amazeballs! I will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and have enjoyed both experiences.

First, the staff was great.  They new their menu and wine selection well, and were very attentive.

We had lunch the first time, so glasses of wine were just $5.  We tried the autostrada sandwich, which was delicious, as was the salad.

We came back for happy hour another day and had a bruschetta platter that was amazing along with the pub board, a delicious mix of flavors.

My wife's favorite part was the music, which had a classic rock vibe.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Gilbert got it right this time :)).  Great food and wine selections $5     Adult  restaurant atmosphere -- nice change from Joes bque  it's about time  to get some variety in Gilbert :)) Good to see this hopping.  Postinos sets the bar for what Gilbert wants and more of !!!  Don't have to travel far to get great venue such as this !"}
{"text":"The food, service and beer selction was outstanding.  We were there on a Friday night and had to wait 30 minutes for a table but that was to be expected.  The water glass was filled before we hit the half way mark, our waitress was outstanding, the bruscetta was stellar and the manager even came over to sit with us for a bit.  I would not only recommend this place to friends, I would take my date there every time."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place located amoung some very good eateries in Old town Gilbert. Been there twice.
the place is pretty plosh and full of very cool people. This place is not designed for your average American. First of all you have to be very cool to be here. Even the chairs are very cool. they are low down to the ground and very nice. Nothing in this place will remind you that you are ordinary. The crowd is very yuppy. Lots of broad rimmed baseball caps and tattoos. More reminders that you are in a very cool environment.
The food is not ordinary. One day I had brunch there. I ordered the bacon and eggs. It came displayed in a way you would never know you were having bacon and eggs. This place screamed \"we are not the good egg\". It even had a little salad with it to absorb all the cholesterol and make you feel good about the animal protein you were consuming.
the second time I ordered the raspberry salad. It was 9.99 and was listed as a main entree. I have some birds in my yard that would have been very unsatisfied with the amount of salad I was given. Luckily I am a small eater. Needless to say it would not be appealing to the \"average\" American if you know what I mean. Again though this place is designed for cool people only and fat people are not cool. It was a very good salad though and I highly recommend it as an appetizer. 
All in all it's a nice place to go grab a bite to eat. And at any point a reality show might just break out there."}
{"text":"LOVE. Good service. Staff is generally friendly and smile. Enjoy the environment. I like the evenings with bruschetta and wine. I also like brunch. It's all good!"}
{"text":"I love this place and it hurts my heart that they made a choice to put it in downtown Gilbert. I hate fighting all the non-drinking mommies who lunch (and bring all 20of their kids) for a table. Bruschetta is good and so are the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Have other reviews on the other locations and they are the same level of food and service. Bruschetta is the bomb! 

The great thing about this location is the demographic, A little bit of family, young and old and just very casual, but nice enough for all the cool moms to hang out and enjoy one of the better establishments of the valley. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I really love this place, especially in the Spring when the Palo Verde trees are beautiful and the little flowers waft down into your hair, lap, food and wine.  A wonderful addition to the already great ambiance.  Of course we are eating on the patio.  Good Happy Hour as well as bottle of wine and bruschetta special on Mondays and Tuesdays.  I love the bruschetta.  Yummy.  Would love to give 5 stars but, for senior citizens, the music is too loud and intrusive for pleasant conversation.  There is a cocktail area out in back, away from the music, but right now they only sell drinks out there.  If they could enlarge the tables and open it up for food, it would be a more quiet area.  Wait staff is super pleasant and attentive.  In spite of the music, it will continue to be one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"Food is to die for, Desert with hot salted caramel, pretzel, chocolate covered corn nuts and vanilla ice cream is great. Wait staff is fantastic great at giving suggestions."}
{"text":"Postino's has phenomenal food and wine list.  My husband and I dined there before 5:00 p.m. and was delighted to discover all glasses of wine were only $5.00.  We were able to try several varieties.  Service was knowledgeable and attentive.  The patio was comfortable and relaxing.  We will definitely return with friends."}
{"text":"Every Monday or Tuesday welcome here and have a asstastactic night!  For real though, the food and beverage is the best in town and it's a great date night under twenty dollars!!!i  I recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Amazing! Do not miss out on this place. We went for brunch and I had a prociutto brie and fig panini, with a side salad. It was incredibly fresh and flavorful, best panini I've ever had by a landslide. Mimosas and bellinis were only $5 and the bellini I had was very good. We will be back to try the bruschetta sampler! The patio was very nice despite the heat with lots of shade and misters."}
{"text":"It's always a pretty long wait so come prepared. My friends and I usually sign in and then go to Oreganos for drinks next door. The bruschetta is AMAZING. I've been to a few wine bars and nothing beats their food. Also the pub board and chocolate cake is a must!"}
{"text":"I ordered a vegetarian sandwich everyone at work kept talking about this place so I wanted to try it one day for lunch. It was delicious especially the bread, there was just a lot of it. You should definitely try it!!"}
{"text":"Yummy bruschetta & salad. Always a wait in the evenings, but I don't mind it because they serve beverages while you wait! One of my favorite patios :)"}
{"text":"great location, loved the area (small town feel) nice atmosphere and great service as well. loved the wine & brochette combo for only $20 wow!! Fabulous menu and super clean, nice staff and great food. will be back as often as we can make it! thanks for a great brunch experience"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices. You can't go wrong coming here for $5 glasses of wine and their delicious bruschetta. I love the fig and proscuitto ones so much that I now make them at home regularly. All the sandwiches I have tried have also been delicious, though the cold ones are a little on the messy side. 

Though the central and Arcadia locations have a little bit more of a scene to them, Postino East is soooo great for those of us relegated to the Chandler/Gilbert area with young children because of the awesome grassy patio area in the back. When my husband and I need to get out for an afternoon but don't have a babysitter, it is awesome to come here and have a couple glasses of wine while our daughter can run around and play."}
{"text":"Love their bruschetta!!  I've ordered it take out a few times.  Love the tomato jam!  I've only eaten in the restaurant once and the cool sofa by the large door was awesome, however the music was so loud I couldn't hear what my sisters were saying without us shouting.  We repeatedly asked them to turn it down with little response.   Their sandwiches are okay and the salad was yum."}
{"text":"I have 1 word to sum up our visit to this new Postino location: phenomenal.
This was my first time to a Postino, and they made very good first impression.
It was already packed at 5pm, and we had to wait for 45 minutes for a table, but that was fine because we grabbed 2 seats at the bar. The service was outstanding from the get go. There was several bar tenders working, and they were all over making sure people had the wine or beer they needed, and very friendly to boot. After hanging out there for a bit, the guy who helped us asked when our table was supposed to be ready. He said if it wasn't ready soon, he'd buy us a round (you don't hear that at other establishments!)! Just after that we moved to our table, where we enjoyed a very tasty and healthy Butcher's Block (meats, cheeses, olives, etc) and an autostrada panini (essentially an italian panini). Both of those were outstanding, not too filling, but fresh, healthy, and different. The wine and beer (couple of micro-brews) we had was great.
Service was outstanding, food was great, and ambiance was unique too! We're already making plans with friends to get back."}
{"text":"I have been there twice, I didn't have a fantastic experience the first time (right after it opened), but I wanted to give it another shot in case we just had bad luck the first time. 

And then happy hour happened today.....

My husband and I sat on the lawn with our dog, and it was such a perfect day to sit outside and sip on some wine and enjoy some bruschetta. That is....until 5-6 employees congregated at a nearby table/chairs outside to roll silverware in napkins, eat dinner, gossip, and talk on their phones (did I mention they were rolling SILVERWARE outside? on the grass? while pausing to take a bite of a their dinner? WHAT?).  One of the utensil baskets was even sitting on the grass, the same grass that my dog was laying on. Perhaps another dog had laid in that same spot before they put the utensils on the ground (or heaven forbid went to the bathroom on that grass)? Then we saw another employee take something out to the dumpster and come back to continue rolling silverware withOUT washing her hands first. 

So...finally a manager came out to tell them it wasn't appropriate for them to be eating out in front of customers, rolling silverware in the napkins on the ground, or talking on their phones. She didn't try to tell them this discretely, we heard it all. It was rather awkward, and kind of killed the ambiance for us. (although it was entertaining). It was like a watching a parent teach their highschooler a lesson about manners. So, they eventually put their food in to go containers, and picked up the utensils from the ground....to then continue to roll silverware outside while gossiping and not washing their hands after eating. 

I don't know how many restaurants have 5-6 extra employees who can just sit around rolling silverware into napkins and eat dinner while on the clock....much less who will allow them to do it 10 feet from paying customers. 

The food was yummy, and our server (not part of this other debacle) was fabulous. That is where the two stars come from."}
{"text":"Love love love Postinos!  Wonderful atmosphere, great service, and the food is fantastic!

Whenever we've had to wait (mostly on the weekends), we've been able to lounge on the grassy area (it's turf but looks and feels pretty real!).  On nice days, it's great.  People bring blankets, babies, and puppies.  Last time, my friend brought the paper and we hung out until they had a table ready for us.  They do a good job of making sure people that are waiting are taken care of as well.

Soup and sandwich combo's are great.  Fresh ingredients and love the breads.  

My absolute favorite is the bruschetta.  I always get the brie/apples (YUM!), fig/mascarpone/prosciutto (can sometimes be hit or miss), Salmon/Pesto (good but sometimes the capers can be overpowering), and the fig/pistachios (again, YUM!).  I'm always satisfied and usually overstuffed.  I can handle a brushetta board by myself but it's probably good enough for two people to share.  

Sometimes get the chips but they aren't anything to write home about.  

Also the cucumber honey lemonade is great but the cucumber taste is strong so may not be great for everyone.  I've gotten used to it and like it but it was definitely an acquired taste.  

The staff look like they could be models and are always so great and helpful.  They know their stuff and are really able to recommendations on food/drink.  

Lots of parking available is also a plus!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Highly recommend this place. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the music is a little too loud to talk and there's always a wait when I've been."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for drinks! Trendiest place in the old town. Waiters were super nice and one even downloaded Find my iPhone to his phone so I could find my misplaced phone. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Postino East is a great place to eat! Good food. Good wine. Great service. The only downside is that it's the middle of the summer in Phoenix and I was sweating...in doors. Ok, so I sweat. And usually it's just me. However, I looked around and everyone in our party was sweating. We stopped the server to ask if she could please bump it down a couple degrees and she told us that the AC was already as cold as it would go. Please, do your patrons a favor and get a new AC unit or some fans installed. We almost left because it was so uncomfortable but stayed because the food is so good!"}
{"text":"I went here recently with friends. Found it a fun and relaxing place to mingle with your best gal pals."}
{"text":"IF you are lucky enough to get in on a Tuesday night, the bruschetta is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Love this location!!! Love their food and their service!!! If you're coming on a Monday or Tuesday night they have a great special with their bruschetta and wine, you get a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine for 20.00. However be forewarned this causes them to get very busy and have long waits, so make sure you account for that. I especially love their salmon and pesto bruschetta. My favorite wine if their Shiraz. My favorite panini is their Nine Iron and focaccia! Great atmosphere to hang out with your friends any time of day!!"}
{"text":"I love Postino's Arcadia location... Can't say the same for gilbert, which sucks- since I live in Gilbert. The service and the atmosphere is so draining. Maybe it's just ME. I recommend going before 6:30 - 7pm, or after 8:45. Otherwise you'll have to wait. I have visited Postino East more than 3 times and have had to wait, then our service was really inconsistent. The food is always fantastic, and so is the wine. I just can't handle the obnoxious patrons and loud- open atmosphere. What's with all the kids too? Jeez, I sound like an old man. Ha. Either way- if I don't feel like going all the way to the phoenix location, I will still stop in to Postino east, but it's usually for lunch when it isn't bombarded with alcoholics trying to get a drink. :-)"}
{"text":"Historic downtown Gilbert view from the patio. I always enjoy the bruschetta board. Excellent service. Great place to take out-of-town visitors for brunch, dinner, or late night."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends after hearing good things. I was blown away. The food was so good I have been dreaming about since I left. I loved the atmosphere of it all, fun music playing in the background, patio/outdoor eating areas,couches. It was all very laid back and relaxing. And the serve was just beyond what I'm used too. Food,drinks and refills came quickly, empty plates left just fast. I never had to look around wondering where my waiter was.   I had such a great time I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"You know the drill.  The bruschetta.  The $5 glasses of wine for happy hour.  The great patio.  What's not to like?! 

I'm a huge fan...for the above reasons and because it is mere miles from my home. I've done brunch...not too bad - but there IS better.  I've done the butcher block and cheese plate - pretty yummy...I enjoy those just as much as the brushetta!  I've even had a sandwich...still good. Whatever they do - they do pretty well. 

Only complaint I'd ever have is the ridiculous wait that they sometimes have...guess that's not their fault, though.  ;)"}
{"text":"The food was wonderful.  Enjoyable place to sit and relax. Chef Andrew and the bar tender made it two thumbs up! !"}
{"text":"SWEET BABY JESUS...... I love this place.
$20 bruchetta and wine night......PERFECT.

My new favorite place in the east valley.
I ate 8 different brucettas that night.

THANK YOU POSTINO's!!!!"}
{"text":"The butcher block and the bruschetta were amazing. The servers were very friendly and attentive to the level of water in my cup. We sat outside, and thought it was very comfortable and had a great atmosphere. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We heard this was an Italian restaurant. Definitely not what we expected. That is to say, it wasn't your typical overpriced fancy pants wannabe-trendy Italian restaurant that really only serves the same dishes you'd find at your neighborhood Olive Garden. I coulda sworn the menu was missing a few pages - but I was wrong, it really does compete with in 'n out for being one of the shortest menus I've ever seen...which seemed even more out of place considering this was a sit-down establishment.  It seemed to be more of a lunch-type menu - basically sandwiches, soups, and salads.  I had the \"9 iron\" panini, and the wife had the veggie. Nobody in our party was disappointed...the food was awesome!  I quickly forgave Mr Postino for the lack of choices.  And honestly, we were pleasantly surprised by the reasonable prices.  Only real sucky thing was that the 80s music in there was soooo freaking loud.  Even though our party of 4 yelled the entire night, we still struggled to hear anyone at our table.  I'm as much of a fan of Depeche Mode and Phil Collins as the next guy, don't get me wrong - but I definitely won't bring anyone I actually want to talk to if I go again. Or better yet, maybe take out?"}
{"text":"Went here on a a Sunday afternoon with some family and I have nothing but good things to say. Although it was pretty packed (always a good sign) our waiters were extremely nice and professional. The good was marvelous, I had a Roast Beef Panini with Chips and it was absolutely delicious. I recommend this place too anyone I meet! Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"A cute and hip place to have some wine with a girlfriend or a date. It's super busy and usually has a wait. It is NOT quiet but busy with conversation. Love the $20 board and bottle specials on Monday and Tuesday nights. They cork the bottle for you so you can take it home."}
{"text":"Visiting family in Gilbert and we decided on Postino East.  Nice outside ambiance with couches and tables.  Inside, it was very loud.  Music did not match the ambiance of a wine bar as it was loud and annoying.  Bruschetta Board had a couple of interesting options like the fig and apple, but overall, food and was average.  Wine selection was good and reasonably priced.  This is definately a \"girls night out\" meeting place but no real ability to have discussion except with the person next to you unless you yell.

Quiet the music, enhance the menu (how many ways can you make Bruschetta) and this place will do well....."}
{"text":"Needed a reservation because we wanted to bring my elderly grandma to the restaurant. Derick was more than accommodating! So grateful for wonderful service :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food.  The day we were there, roasted red pepper gouda was the soup - so so good!  I also had the vegetarian panini - enjoyed that too.  The environment at lunchtime on a Monday was loud but in a funky, fun, \"our business is thriving\" kind of way.  We had people refilling our drinks constantly (maybe a little too often actually!).  A great place for a yummy lunch."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great variety for beer and wine, as you would expect a good wine bar to have! The food is always good! The bruschetta board is always safe, but I also enjoy a lot of the sandwiches available, including their nostalgic yet novel grilled cheese! The price is extremely reasonable as well for what you get, especially on Bottle and Board nights!"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. Super cool vibe, excellent eats, and amazing ambiance. We absolutely take every out of town visitor to Postino, showing off what Arizona Food can be."}
{"text":"The effortless cool of Postino, Gilbert style.  An excellent and ever changing wine selection, great food (the bruschetta board is a must), and an attractive young staff makes this restaurant/bar a regular stop on my dining train. 

The price is right, food is fab but not too fussy, and the service is fast and friendly.  Oh, and if ambiance is what you want... Look no further.  Comfy and colorful couches and tables abound amid a dim and always flattering lighting scheme. There's even a little picnic area in back where you can bring a date, throw a blanket on the turf, and enjoy a bottle of wine and some grub."}
{"text":"We live down the street so its easy to stop in when we're feeling like a great glass of wine and their signature bruschetta. I have never been dissappointed. Sometimes I wish they would expand their menu, Its somewhat limited - bruschetta, salad or sandwiches."}
{"text":"Cool environment, good food and drink selection, great happy hour prices but they could turn the music down a scoatch so the customers could hear each other easier. We will definitely be back but hopefully next time the DJ won't have such a heavy hand."}
{"text":"I honestly like this place more for their service than I do their food, and I REALLY like their food. 

My family and I have been coming here for a while and ALWAYS order a bruschetta board or two. The last time we were here, it took a bit longer than normal for our food, but not obnoxiously so. Before we had a chance to say anything (or really felt the need to), the manager came over and apologized for the wait, offered a 'you're awesome' card (free board of bruschetta), and also offered to pay for our desert. That shows initiative on their behalf. Our server was incredible aswell, ALWAYS attentive to our needs. 

The food is incredible. The variety of bruschetta leaves something for everyone, and hits every sweet and salty note just right. The paninis are wonderful, also. My personal favorite is the prosciutto and brie and fig. I honestly have yet to have something from here that I just plain don't like. I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place gets packed on the weekend....and for good reason! Wine is great! Food is great! Service is always excellent! Great place to gather with a group or with that special someone. Try their Sunday Brunch....wonderful!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed last night.  I have heard for years how fabulous Postinos is so last night my wife and I drive half an hour over to Postino's east to have dinner with friends.   We put our names in for a table for 4 for first available, and were told 45 minutes.   An hour and 40 minutes later we were still waiting for a table.   After inquiring inside they offered a table that was so wet from the over zealous misting system that water was running off the table.   All the host could offer at that point was for us to wait for -the next- table.

I could have driven to Flagstaff an had dinner in the time this transpired.   We left the restaurant hungry and mad, never having eaten at 8:45ish.

Never going back.     Too many other restaurants in the valley to choose from."}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals and the place to be on Monday and Tuesday nights for their bottle and board! Even though they are always busy, their staff is amazing and always great service. Shout out to Austin the cutest server here ;) P.S. He also has great taste in wine!"}
{"text":"Yummy and great service! Romantic environment and a great chance to enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"I am visiting Arizona and met with friends for dinner at Postino East.  I was a little weary only because I'm not a big adventurer with food...I tend to stick to the same types of eateries with the same kinds of foods.  

I am SO glad they took me here!  It was Delicious!  

The ambiance was amazing...you forget you're on the corner of what looked like a semi major roadway and are swept off to this charming little wine bar.  There were tables, sofas, indoor or outdoor, bar area and it looks like they are building even more outdoor seating!

We shared the Bruschetta as an app.  I can tell you that the warm artichoke was fantastic!  The apple and fig and prosciutto and fig were equally as fantastic!  My friends also raged for the red peppers as well but I'm not a red pepper fan.

As a meal, we got the Raspberry Chicken Salad.  They were actually able and willing to give me a half order...bonus!  And with no problem, they kitchen split an order for my friends.

Oh, and of course the wine was fantastic, and plentiful!

The staff was friendly and accommodating.  

I wish there were one near me in VA!"}
{"text":"Wow...great food and wine makes for a wonderful experience.   The setting with the doors open makes this a must visit place to eat.  Strongly recommended after two dinner visits and a breakfast visit.  Consistantly excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent beer and wine list and thankfully employees who know it well.  I had the bruchetta and my my husband had the autostrada panini.  Both were really quite wonderful.  We sat at the outside bar.  The bartender was excellent and very fast food service.  

This is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5:  We arrived at 4:00 pm on Saturday.  We were shocked when the hostess asked us if we had reservations,  which we didn't (never thought we'd need one at that time of day).  She told us it would be 45 minutes.  We asked if we could sit at the bar.  We were told no,  so we left.  As we were headed back to our car my husband noticed the outside windows were open to the interior bar and there was seating.  He asked the bartender if he could serve us there.  Bam.  We had drinks in front of us in less than 3 minutes and our food in 15.  

It turned out that they serve a mean happy hour which is why they were slammed.  So glad my husband scoped out the bar.  We will be back - and will make sure we have reservations!"}
{"text":"best place ever! great vibed, great food! Very clean and fast service.  Employees are so happy all the time it's great ."}
{"text":"We are new to town and we're just walking by when we decided to try it. The atmosphere is great, and it smelled amazing. I had a mixed green salad which was so much better than I anticipated and my dad had bruschetta. I was skeptical about the bruschetta because there is SO much bread. But I have to say I had a bite of each of the four types and loved them all. And $5 glass of wine? Yes please!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere that will make you forget you're in Arizona. Hip and cool without being pretentious. Immediately greeted by MGMT and Arcade Fire coming through the speakers - this is my kind of place.

As other reviews indicate the bruschetta is the star here. If you're not into big meals I recommend ordering just a bruschetta platter (and possibly splitting it with a friend or date) and skipping to dessert. 
I was too full to finish my panini. It was good, but not as stellar as the bruschetta. 

Service was near perfect. Everyone was friendly without being overbearing."}
{"text":"Bruschetta boards are amazing. Yes, I'll eat 2 full boards myself no problem! Love the wine selection. If you can get there for Happy Hour you'll not only guarantee yourself a seat, you'll also get great deals on the wine! Eat and drink up!"}
{"text":"I have heard so many great things about this place! Finally I just had to try it out. We  went on a Tuesday night for their $20 special. For $20 you get to choose a bottle of wine and four different bruschetta. The bruschetta is beautifully made and delish!! Our favorites were the prosciutto and the goat cheese and pepper. YUM!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour and patio. Can be crowded inside but that's because it's really good."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I was sold! However, I just could not rate it 5 stars.  I do find it a little ODD that the waitresses and waiters dress in everyday street clothes. So it is often difficult to tell who works there and who does not. Which is a little off putting for some. When it is busy, it is BUSY. If you do not get there RIGHT at 4:30, especially on a Friday night, prepare to wait 30 minutes easy, and after that, it is quite the wait for food. However, it deserves its 4 star rating for the impeccable food. The menu is a little strange and definitely not for everyone. Went for brunch with some friends & ended up being very thrown by the menu. Other than that its great!"}
{"text":"Service was attentive.

The food ambrosial."}
{"text":"My favorite place to hang with the girls! Wine selections change every 3 months and the service is always friendly and helpful.  The bruschetta is super tasty.  Getting a table on Monday or Tuesday night can be difficult. We go about once a month.  Lunch time is great time to try 'em out.  $5 glasses of wine all day until 5pm.

I would give 5 stars but I absoulutely hate their website! It is hard to navigate and I would've never gone their if I had looked it up that way.  Postino's east is fabulous and their website is so difficult you can hardly tell where they are located."}
{"text":"My favorite wine bar and lunch spot! The butchers block is amazing if you're in the mood for munchies, and they always have a unique soup of the day. It's a little pricey for food, but the quality is there, for sure. And wine is $5 a glass! Yum!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Postino. As far as locations go, I think Gilbert has the best food overall followed by Postino Arcadia and then Postino Central, but I would give all of them 5 stars except Postino Central which I gave 4 (due to freshness of ingredients). 

If this is your first time trying Postino, you MUST try the bruschetta. It is out of this world. I've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if they are trying to copy Postino's bruschetta, but it is never as good. 

Aside from the bruschetta, the salads are wonderful, all of them, my favorite being the italian picnic. 

Most importantly, the wine is amazing at Postino. If you are not sure which to try, ALWAYS try the Postino exclusive. It will never let you down. All the locations except for Gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is really nice also. Even better, on Mondays and Tuesdays if you come at 8pm they have their special - any bottle of wine AND a tray of bruschetta! It cannot be beat!!"}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times now and have had excellent service, food and wine. I ordered a wonderful Pinot Noir and I always seem to have good luck with the paninis. Definitely a great place for a light meal and glass of wine. They have great deal too, from 11am-5pm any glass of wine is 5 bucks, so its not a bank breaker. Great place for a date or a just a good time."}
{"text":"it\"s just an upscale sandwich place, there is  not to much to screws in making a panini.  Very loud and annoying music, Wrong pick for our Easter lunch"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a birthday and was impressed with the great ambiance, service, wine and food.  This is detinitely a great addition to downtown Gilbert!"}
{"text":"I live in the area so visit Postino's often (less now that other places like Zinburger and LoLos have opened). It is a really nice place, trendy, most of the bartenders are nice.  Great place for a girls night/afternoon out or a lazy Sunday or a romantic date.  They have a great patio and picnic area.  Sometimes they have live music playing outside.  The only reasons I do not give them 5 stars is 1) short (I mean REALLY short) pours on the beer pitchers; 2) very expensive glasses of wine when happy hour ends; 3) some (a small portion, I won't call them out) of the staff are sooooo rude."}
{"text":"We always have a great time here!!  The bruschetta and the atmosphere are always awesome.  Tonight we sat at the bar because it was so busy and a trainee named Katie was our server.  She was awesome!!!  Service was great and she had a great personality!  This place never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place for tapas and wine!  
Their bruschetta is TDF and there is always an upbeat, friendly vibe. I have been coming here for years and the one thing I love about postinos is they are consistently great! Great for a date night, girls night, date with Mom. You name it!"}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with this place, and it's not because of the drinks or food. It's the service that keeps me confused.

The wine selection is stellar, and the food has its proper fit. Sure the bruschetta is a hallmark dish and the chicken salad is a delight...but let's be honest with ourselves: most of us do not flock to Postino for *only* the food. 

With solid drinks, but stable food, a lot is left to the server experience.

Therein lies the problem. Why? Because Postino seems to take a co-op or commune approach to their serving. Essentially, you don't have one server assigned to you (at least that's what they tell me). Table service is shared. Servers generally float around, check in, and get ppl what they need.

This approach would work...if every hipster-server had the right balance of social skills and a keen awareness of what's going on around them.  But we all know that is asking *way* too much from any hipster. So, your co-op dining experience quickly turns into an orphan experience, i.e., you are constantly searching for someone to take care of you.

This all leads to varied experiences: on one visit, the tattoo-laced servers are on point...the next day the servers are aimlessly walking past me, exerting all their effort in trying master the lyrics to a Smashing Pumpkins single that's blaring from the sound system. 

It's all confusing to me.

Postino: stop trying to live on the fringes of society and, please, just go back to an assigned server model."}
{"text":"LOUD

LOUD

OH MY GOD THE MUSIC IS GODDMN FKING LOUD HERE

IT IS ONLY A FEW DECIBELS BELOW THE LEVEL IN A CLUB

THEN THE PEOPLE AROUND US HAVE TO HOLLER TO HEAR EACH OTHER AND IT'S EVEN NOISIER

OH MY GOD WILL YOU TURN DOWN THE FKING VOLUME ON THAT MUSIC?

oh yeah, the food. Early dinner on a Sunday. The Hannah's Field salad, the greens were very fresh and crisp but small portion. Wife ordered the Raspberry Chicken salad; also small. The chicken salad part of the salad was amazing. The raspberry dressing was unbelievably sour and I like tart; this was too tart even for me. Maybe you're supposed to mix it all together to take the edge off the very sour raspberry dressing? (The greens are laid out on a rectangular dish separately from the chicken salad.) Our other dining companion ordered the Tuscan Tuna salad panino. I found myself envying those who had selected the panini instead of salad; it seemed more filling than the meager portions those of us who chose salad were given. The salted caramel sundae was quite good and enough for two; it comes with a tall shot glass filled to the rim with caramel sauce, a very generous amount, to drizzle over the tasty vanilla bean ice cream. Service was competent if perhaps a little too attentive; we could have done with two fewer visits by the waiter. He also didn't need to ask me if I needed anything on one visit; when the empty glass of iced tea is sitting right in front of me and in front of you, do you really need to ask me if I need anything? How about starting with asking me if I want more iced tea?

DID I MENTION HOW LOUD THE MUSIC IN THIS PLACE IS? I was annoyed throughout our meal at how I had to strain to hear the conversation. Never going back, solely for this reason."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently had dinner at the Postino's in Gilbert since we were big fans of the one in Arcadia. The place is amazing!! There was a small mistake with our order(allergy), but the waitress (Marsha) and management did a great job fixing everything!!! We will definitely be back!!"}

{"text":"My happy place, if you are looking for me you might just find me here, especially before 5pm (I hope it's a Saturday or Sunday if it's during the week I may have a problem.) Gilbert finally has a great wine bar.

The bruschetta is amazing, the sandwiches are very nice especially when they ask you how thick you want your bread. And then there is the wine - nice selection by the glass and very nice by the bottle. 

The ambiance is lovely, I've sat at the bar with a friend and we were able to have a great conversation, I've sat outside twice and it was very enjoyable even in the heat. My only complaint is the music can be too loud for conversation outside. 

The service has been wonderful for every one of my visits. Table service and bar. 

Did I see someone complain that mom's were bringing their kids here? Hahaha, it's Gilbert - we take our kids everywhere. I'm fairly confident the owners knew they would have plenty of kid visitors when they decided to open in Gilbert."}

{"text":"Very nice atmosphere.  Great appetizers and lunch fare.  The pricing is excellent for the quality of food, atmosphere and service.  This is a perfect lunch spot to take friends.  There is also a great craft beer menu and a good selection of wine by the glass.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Was disappointed second we have eaten there. We last Sunday it was packed.  The week before it was delicious,  last week it was awful cold food, the music was so  loud you couldn't even talk. Service was good food was terrible. Won't go back"}
{"text":"I love the salads here, as well as the bellinis.  The patio is fantastic and I like the crowd.  Always a nice time at Postino in Gilbert!!"}
{"text":"Upon my third visit to Postino's it was so busy that the wait was over an hour to get a table for two at 9 PM on a weekday. Postino's only takes reservations for parties over 8. Called the next day after making arrangements to bring a group of 10 to the restaurant and was informed that since they already had a few other big tables with reservations we were out of luck. They suggested we show up early and wait. I asked if they had room for us and they said \"yes but we do not like having that many big parties with reservations.\" Why have a policy that makes you have a big party to make a reservation if you will not give such a reservation even if there is room for one? I am glad the establishment is doing well but I feel that this is unfair service."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of all the Upward Projects restaurants, but Postino is by far my favorite.  I've been to all the Postino locations a bunch of times.  Gilbert is actually my favorite location.  Compared to the others, the space here is huge. They've done it up in a cool modern industrial design style.  Large garage doors open to the outside for those beautiful 80 degree nights we have in the Valley.  The crowd is surprisingly young and hip for Gilbert (sorry).  If I didn't know better, I'd think I was in Central Phoenix.  They've got ample outdoor patio space.  It's great for a romantic one-on-one evening, or for a large group of people.  Check it out on Monday and Tuesday nights after 8 for the Bottle and Board special."}
{"text":"Really cool place with a hip vibe.  Excellent food and solid service, eclectic menu, great wine selection- highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ok so after complaining (nicely) they brought us a new butcher's block and also comped it. Which was good but... Still annoying that we had to say something and listen to them make excuses."}
{"text":"The food is great, especially their choice of bruschetta and their staff is always friendly. My only complaint is the music that is often so loud that it is difficult to carry a conversation in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love Postino!!!! A wonderful place to hang out with family and friends especially after an exhausting working day. Suited in a very picturesque place Postino provides wonderful atmosphere with its amazingly friendly and professional staff, and, of course, the most delicious food ever. A wide range of tasty bruschettas  and paninis are always our favorites, especially Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone and Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato. And prices are so reasonable. Thank you, guys!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great ready to wait a long time for a table if it more than just 2 people... but it's worth the wait! I always end up getting the bruschetta... and they are always great! The service is always so personable even when they are busy!"}
{"text":"My Favorite Wine Bar In Gilbert! Just A Beautiful Setting, This Place Is A Must! Plan A Date With Your Girlies & Your Day Will Be Splendid!"}
{"text":"Met a few friends here for some drinks. Food was amazing and friendly service. Love the different selections of bruschetta. The boards allow everyone to taste different options and are a great deal. Good place to go, I will be back."}
{"text":"Thank you for giving us a cool place in Gilbert. Seriously.

Mondays & Tuesdays are a hit with my buddies because for $20 you get a bottle and a board of bruschetta. Not bad right?

The wine list isn't huge but it works and the place is cute and the people are friendly. They don't by any means have the best of the best wine but it's a good causal hangout. It's almost always crowded but we've come to expect that. Even if the tables are filled and you're on the wait list they will still let you order wine and drink on the patio out front."}
{"text":"This is the second Postinos I've been to, and both were awesome.  This time, we went for the \"plate of bruschetta and bottle of wine for $20\" deal they have on Monday and Tuesday evenings.  We went with another couple, so it was double the fun.  

The atmosphere is great; relaxed and classy.  The service is good in that they pretty much leave us alone so we can talk in peace, but aren't so far away that we can't get attention.  And the food and wine are awe.some.  I've only had the bruschetta, never any entrees, but who needs that?  With the wide variety of bruschetta (especially when you've doubled the order) and copious amounts of wine, I don't require anything more.  I loved the salmon/cream cheese option and the apple/brie, and the traditional mozzarella/tomato/balsamic is fantastic.  I don't know much about wine, but I enjoyed whatever it was we had!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience we had at Postino East on Saturday evening. We had been working for months with their catering department to reserve the lawn area for my mom's birthday. There was no detail left undone. Natalie who coordinates the events was fantastic to work with every step of the way. Then on the actual day of the event we worked with Savannah and Anna. Both of which were so professional, communicated wonderfully, kind and so wonderful to our guests. We truly had the absolute best time and would highly recommend this location for your next large gathering."}
{"text":"Great food and cute ambiance in Gilbert. There is indoor seating, outdoor seating and a park-like area for people to sit with their pets or wait for their table. The service was good as well. Highly recommend for brunch! Good value also."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great service, and great people. What more can you ask for? I always have a splendid time whenever I go here, with either friends or on a date."}
{"text":"Anyone who rates this restaurant anything less than 5 stars needs to go to the doctor and get their brain checked. The customer service and food is always on point and they are so consistent. Time and time again my wife and I go and we never have one complaint. They have an amazing formula going on there and if they remain on top of their game, they will be there for a long time."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is my go-to for Girl's Nights or Brunch. Great wine selection, delicious food, and very friendly staff. There is often a wait to be seated, but it's always worth it."}
{"text":"We were impressed and will return. The service was impeccable. They managed a large crowd with ease. It was nice to hang out with my beau and people watch in downtown Gilbert. We would like to try a Monday/Tuesday night special next.

Our first bottle of wine was a Spanish white. It was a great pairing with the bruschetta. The  white bean and traditional were my favorites. We tried the dips because we were ravenous and the 2.5 hour wait to get inside where they served the full menu wasn't going to work. The  artichoke and hummus dips were good, not great,  so I wouldn't order them again,  but the bruschetta...ahhh!

The second bottle of white  recommended by the manager was undrinkable. I wouldn't use it in cooking or for vinegar either. It is the first time we ever sent wine back, anywhere. The price and screw cap should have been a clue. But hey, screw caps are in vogue these days;, but I digress. I will be far more careful next time since I assumed they would not include gut rot in their selections. It's name was Domaine something... the manager did omit the swill from our bill.

Nice to have a place like this in our neck of the woods. FYI, don't park in the adjacent \"the ride and share\" lot and plan on keeping your car there over a Friday night. The next day is the Farmers Market, it will be held hostage until the market is over and/or have produce displayed on the hood since it'll be right smack in the way. Welcome to Gilbert Postino's. It's a  really great date night spot and a walk away from home."}
{"text":"Monday's and Tuesday's happy hour a board and a bottle, yes please! Love love love their bruschetta, apple, bacon arugula, salmon pesto, and artichoke- my order every time :)"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is spotty. The location is cute and the outdoor spot is good for kids. Prices are a little high for relatively basic food."}
{"text":"I went on a Wednesday and sat at the bar.

Food was ok, wine was priced right, service ok.

Pretty solid place to hang out if you don't have high food expectations.

Great terrace."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant to eat at! I have so many great memories with family and friends here at this restaurant. When anyone asks me where my favorite place to eat is I always say Postino. Everything on their menu is amazing right down to the wine. I can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Bruschetta - O.M.G. I love their salad and sandwich pick two for lunch - oh, and wine $5 weekdays till 5?! It keeps me coming back. At least once a month!"}
{"text":"Postino never disappoints!

The food is delicious and the service is spot on.

I usually go for the bruschetta but I have sampled a couple of the sandwiches and been here for brunch.

The patio is great (weather permitting). This Postino is not as \"trendy\" as the others but definitely one of the best spots in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love Postino.  My wife and I make our weekend pilgrimage here as often as possible.  With daily happy hour until 5 pm that includes any glass of wine or small pitcher of beer for $5, no wonder this place is always packed.

The patio is fantastic and the service is always A+.  We often bring friends or family that have not experienced Postino and they are always impressed by the prices and the employee attentiveness.  Doesn't hurt that the bruchetta board is to die for!!

It can be pretty busy on a weekend afternoon so be prepared to possibly wait for a table.  Well worth it though!"}
{"text":"Postino's is my go-to for some laid back girl time. I usually go to the one in Tempe, the Gilbert location did not disappoint. The service, as always, wad friendly and the bruschetta board always hits the spot. The Apple, brie, and fig is probably my favorite. The grilled cheese is a great appetizer choice too if you're really hungry. If you're an olive person, get a bowl of those. They include a briny, good selection."}
{"text":"Semi disappointed in the limited menu. Google said it was an Italian restaurant but its mainly paninis and bruschetta. The salads you can only add turkey, chicken or prosciutto. No seafood or steak option. Limited protein selection. And they don't accept reservations. Won't be back. Confused why it has such a high rating. Food was just ok. Maybe people come for the large wine selection."}
{"text":"Love this place. Must get the Bruschetta it is awesome.  Service is always great, love the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE, I am IN love with this place!!!  The gluten-free bruschetta boards are so good that I can't even tell the bread is GF!  And the red pepper Gouda soup is to die for - and that's coming from someone who usually skips the soup.  ;). And don't even get me started on the unbelievable atmosphere..."}
{"text":"The bruschetta is amazing and they have such a great wine selection. Only downside, we waited an hour n a half for a table! (That was a table for two)"}
{"text":"I love the vibe and service at Postinos as much as any place I've ever been. This place may be my favorite location of all of them. SO GOOD. SUCH A GREAT HAPPY HOUR. 50 miles from my house... 

Please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please PLEASE!!! ... Build one in the NW valley. Please, damn it!

I promise you could turn a profit just off My Wife and I and our crazy/cool friends and family.

Please?"}
{"text":"The food here is simply amazing. My favorite was the bruschetta with fig jam, apple and brie but everything I ate was phenomenal. The wait to get a table was long but they keep you as comfy as possible with misters and serving drinks. I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"The first time we had gone here wasn't the best experience. We had a couple sitting next to us arguing the whole time quite loudly, and that made the whole experience really uncomfortable and we couldn't really enjoy our food, because we just wanted to get out of there!
I went back with a girlfriend, and it was very enjoyable!! Love the blinis! and I can't get enough of their bruschetta!! 
I really like that they also offer a half sandwich, have salad or soup deal!!! Its nice to get a little bit of everything with the half deal!
Over all, this is my go to place for when I have friends/family in town who really enjoy wine, and yummy food!"}
{"text":"This place is F.U.N
they've got a great list of wines, that the staff are knowledgeable of, for a slamming deal! Buy a bottle and get a board of crustini with some epic toppings
We had a ball, I cannot wait to go back"}
{"text":"Came here about a month ago with a girlfriend of mine I hadn't seen in a while! We went in the middle of the day in the middle of the week--it was quite lovely! We sat outside on the patio next to the heater and did some people watching. The house vino was very nice, I remember it being very fruity. What was REALLY great, though, was the bruscetta we ordered! Mmmmm! Yumm!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our Valentines night at Postino's very. Very professional staff! We will definitely be dining there again!"}
{"text":"Wow - what a great lunch at Postino East yesterday.  Tuscan Tuna was excellent and the side salad just as tasty as those home made fries my son-in-law ate!  Made me wish we could spend the afternoon and do some wine tasting.  Service was excellent too.  My new favorite restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE! This location needs a Sangria Sunday like the Arcadia location, but I can get over it because I love them so much. Everything is delicious. The worst thing about leaving Arizona was leaving Postino behind as well."}
{"text":"In love with this place! This restaurant has been about 80 different things before they bought it and so happy they did! Finally, something to do in downtown Gilbert . Service is always fantastic and of course the food, drink, and atmosphere are fabulous. I've been about 10 times and it's never a bad experience."}
{"text":"Fun place for dinner if your not in a hurry. The staff is a little aloof for my taste. Definitely a pretentious crowd, but not horrible. The food is better than I expected."}
{"text":"Tapas, this is the way I like to eat.  A little bit of everything.
Great atmosphere, great food selection and quality.  
I had my first date with my soon to be fiance at the Kierland location."}
{"text":"The BEST bruschetta hands down!!! I like all their salad as well. Very tasty! Excellent hang out with family and friends."}
{"text":"Walked over here just now from Joyride,  Which we had to leave because the mood and vibe were akin to being laid back while watching the rest of the room spin out on speed!! Much better vibe and mood for this night . Bartenders are Laid back, not pretentious yet observant.  Ordered a nine iron and several bruschetta. The Brie, fig & Apple is delicious and the prosciutto & marscopone is heavenly!!!  Great ambience. We left at midnight and didn't feel rushed at all. There were still a few patrons chilling out."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the east valley. I always get the bruschetta, it is to die for. Can't say enough about it.  I also like the cr√©me brulee and the chocolate bouchon. Yum! 

However, I almost gave it a 4 star, because I asked the waiter what their twitter handle was and he said he didn't know what twitter was. Really? Trying so hard to be too cool for school.

But the ambiance and food made up for it."}
{"text":"Postino's is always a go-to spot when looking for a casual and fun night out. The bruschetta board it a staple as well as their panini's. Great wine list and everything is incredibly reasonable.

To top it off the service is always phenomenal. I wish I had the names of the workers who were closing on Thursday, July 2nd....we stopped in for just a couple glasses of wine before we decided we wanted to stay out a bit longer and went to Champions. There were three of us girls, we left Champions and started to be followed by two men...we were scared. We saw Postino's closing and asked if we could come in for our safety. They immediately let us in and the male workers went out and told the two men to get lost. Then they offered to walk us all to our cars. Couldn't have been more thankful!!!!"}
{"text":"Position's is amazing!  The food is always on point, the Butcher Block & Bruschetta are always on the must have list when we visit!  It's a tad warm to be on the patio in the Arizona summer, but we always make do because the food and drink are so fabulous!  Always great service and the food is always always amazing!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and a perfect patio when the weather permits! Come before five and get $5 glasses of wine and pitchers (2 pints) of draft beer!!

The wine list is always changing and the bruschetta is fantastic. I always finish up with the creme br√ªl√©e, certainly one of my guilty pleasures and theirs is delicious (from someone who lived in France)."}
{"text":"Love it! Friendly bartenders, great ambiance and very refreshing to find in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Food was delicious and portions were just right. Good music and great atmosphere. The service overall was awesome they were all very attentive! I would definitely recommend this place. I love the fig and apple bruschetta."}
{"text":"Every single thing on their menu is  phenomenal. We love the bruschetta and pub board. With $5 wine and beer pitchers every day from 11-5 you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Great little hipster wine bar in the heart of downtown Gilbert. Wine and fancy snacks are their fort√©. We had several kinds of bruschetta that were all light and tasty but didn't blow me away as it was average bread topped with average ingredients. The staff is very friendly but service was also average. We had a good time and got what we expected. The atmosphere was the best part, everyone's drinking wine so of course they're happy! Will probably have to get a full meal elsewhere but I would definitely come again if I had an occasion."}
{"text":"Always love Postino.  Whether  for happy hour with colleagues or after dinner out with friends.  It is always enjoyable.  The only reason it is not 5 stars is that there is always a wait (which is not bad) but there is plenty of room out back and could be more seating.  Otherwise, a 5 star experience every time."}
{"text":"Happy birthday to myself enjoying Bruschetta and vino tinto. Great ambiance and wonderful Food."}
{"text":"This place is horrible and the service actually disgusted me. I went there this last weekend; it was packed of course which is fine; however, everybody was running around in a chaotic manner as if they all were on day 1 of opening. Postino in Arcadia is a great place but Postino East has a lot to still improve on.  The male server on the lawn insisted we all be on the same check because we met a few friends there but I don't see why we would have to even do that as all other restaurants/bars don't require this. Then our table was finally ready after an hour wait. Once I informed them we only needed a table for 4 instead of 6 they then made us wait another 15 minutes even though the table was already cleaned for 6. So after not moving any tables the manager tells u we can take another table once it's cleaned.  The manager seemed irritated and rude just telling us to go back to the lawn and she would get us once the table was ready. My bruschetta came out 45 minutes later; even after the other 3 people had already received their meals. No idea as to why bruschetta would take longer to prepare??? Our server was also impatient and ill mannered. She kept asking where we got our glasses of wine and whether or not we paid for them already. I don't know why she felt the need to ask us this SAME question 3 times; each time she came over to the table?? Maybe she should've been more concerned with the crappy service she was providing and the fact the bruschetta was taking 45 minutes. I was considering having a bridal shower here and there's no way I will ever consider that again. I would hate to invite a bunch of guests to this place for them to be treated poorly by the ridiculously absurd customer service this place seems to enforce. I was really disappointed and will probably never go back again.  It's quite hard to explain the poor service. Go ahead and check it out for yourself but don't say I didn't warn u!!!"}
{"text":"Frickin awesome!! Wine was amazing & the food choices were great!! Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Glad to have a comfy wine bar on the East side. I love Postino, and would eat there every day if they served their Roasted Red Pepper & Gouda soup more regularly."}
{"text":"Always a long wait, but we were lucky and snagged seats at the bar. The bartenders were very friendly and all seemed to be working as a team to take care of bar top guests. The food and wine were delicious as always. They did change a great Chris Stapleton song about twenty seconds in for something more main stream! But I won't take a star away for that. Just don't let it happen again!"}
{"text":"I conducted some interviews here for Avon and the management put me at a place where I could plug my computer in.   I thought that was wonderful.  The food was excellent and though I don't drink, the atmosphere was lively and packed. youravon.com/kmeyer2352"}
{"text":"High energy, love the music, great food, great service by our server \"Kristin.\" We have just relocated back to the east valley and found this jewel! Who knew?!! This is surely to become one of our favorites :):)"}
{"text":"We went here for Sunday brunch (9-1).  It's a really open air restaurant. The front 'door' of the restaurant opens widely and there are long couches opening out onto the covered patio.  It was easy to imagine sitting there with friends sharing wine and appetizers.  The patio goes around the sides and towards the back there is a little grassy area that I imagine is pretty packed at Happy Hour.  The menu, food presentation, and d√©cor really make it feel like eating at a European bistro.

We sat on the side of the patio.  The road noise was a little bothersome - next time I would sit farther back on the patio.  (Note, we arrived at 8:50 so the restaurant was pretty empty and quiet at first - that may have made the road noise more noticeable.)  We were also right under a speaker -- some other reviewers have commented about the music being too loud.  I would imagine with our table location at peak time, conversation might have been tough.

Hubby had the bruschetta ($13.50) - Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes.  The bread was outstanding and the flavors really blended nicely.  He liked all of them, but his favorite was the ricotta with dates & pistachios - wouldn't have thought to put this combination together but it was outstanding.  

I had the roast beef Panini with ciabatta and romaine salad for the side.  The ciabatta was toasted which helped blend all the flavors.  It was very good.  I try to keep my carbs low so for the second half of the sandwich, I took the top of the bread off and ate it like a bruschetta. The romaine had feta cheese and very light sprinkling of seeds.  Not sure if there was a dressing but if so it was very, very light.

Had the cr√®me brulee for dessert.  Haven't had cr√®me brulee that good in Phoenix metro area since Elaine's closed.  Lots of vanilla bean flavor with a properly light and crispy carmelized top.  Mmm.

I had water and hubby had iced tea (although he didn't drink it because he doesn't care for fruit-flavored teas).  Bill came to $35.  They appear to run multiple specials where drinks are cheaper ($5 glass of wine).  I'm not a beer drinker but they seemed to have quite an eclectic selection of beer.

We live in Gilbert and the options for non-chain restaurants are pretty limited, so I think we'll be back."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome atmosphere. The food is incredibly modern, and delicious. They give generous portions on all their meals and appetizers; and reasonable wine and beer prices. I went with a large group of people, and we ordered a wide variety of food. Was easy and fun to share with the group. I would highly recommend ordering a large variety and sharing. Also, my girlfriend and I split a sandwich. They are HUGE, easily more than enough to share with someone. 

They seemed to have a lot of goat cheese on their appetizers, it would have been a little more exciting if they had a bigger spread of cheeses on their butchers board.  Which would be appreciated to pair with all of the wine they have here. 

And thanks Chelsea for the awesome service!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Everyone is so friendly, but my favorite is Kenley. He is awesome. He always gives you the best deals and gives you the best tips!
The 5$ wine by the glass/pitchers of beer before 5 and the bruschetta are my favorite things there! With the bruschetta, don't be afraid to get creative!! You can ask for thin slices of bread or the fig spread on the prosciutto bruschetta, instead of the figs themselves (makes it easier to eat for sure). Every time I go here it is consistently good!! Definitely worth a trip to downtown Gilbert!!"}
{"text":"Love coming here and always consider it a treat when I do! Good for a date night or catching up with friends.  I've had every bruschetta and each one was delicious. I've also tried some sandwiches and salads. If it's your first time, you definitely need to get the bruschetta.  It does get busy on their bruschetta + wine combo nights so I recommend getting there early or just plan on waiting a while. So glad they moved to the east valley!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot in the Phoenix area! Delicious wine and bruschetta! The service is a bit rude and flippant at times-hit or miss really, but they're just trying to look like cool (wannabe) hipsters. I'll let them be. Great place though!"}
{"text":"Great wine selection, delicious salads and paninis! Wait staff are so very attentive!"}
{"text":"Finally went to Postinos after many people telling me how good it is. I went in with high exceptions and i was let down. Our food was overpriced and honestly not that good.  We ate on the patio and the misters were leaking on us, my friends pants where completely soaked, the service was ok but nothing special. There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better"}
{"text":"About damn time.

Anybody who's been to Postino Arcadia or Postino Central knows what to expect from a Postino restaurant:  great wine selection, incredible food, and a modern but relaxed atmosphere.

Postino East hits it out of the park as to each.  We went on opening day at 5:00, and managed to snag a table inside (it was COLD outside that day).  Service was snappy, especially considering it was the first day and super crowded.  My wife ordered a couple of bellini's and I had a \"personal pitcher\" (couple of pints) of Hop Knot IPA.  The kids split a mixed plate of turkey, apples, grapes and bread, along with fresh made lemonade.

I had a half Raspberry Chicken salad and a half of the Turkey Panini, and my wife had the same sandwich.  Food was excellent all around.  The Turkey Panini comes on your choice of ciabatta or foccacia bread, and has a wonderful pesto sauce on it.  It's really good.

We didn't even order the bruschetta, which we've had at Postino Central and which can't be beat.  Next time, for sure.

For our next visit we'll probably go between 11:00 and 5:00 pm, because there are $5 wines and personal pitchers of beer, every day of the week during those times.  We'll also hit it after movies, as it's open until Midnight every day of the week except Sunday (when it is still open until 11:00!)

They did a great job with the redesign.  The place is not large, but is a decent size, and has a nice modern wine-bar feel to it.  It's very comfortable.

Welcome to the east valley, Postino.  Please stay a while!"}
{"text":"Menu needs more variety.  Food was pretty good but not noteworthy.  Service average as it was busy so we were always trying to flag down our server.  Noisy so a good place to bring kids as it's hard to hear anyone at your table anyway. Nice location and ambience is fun."}
{"text":"good place to hangout with friends and enjoy bruschetta :) great selection of wine too"}
{"text":"I am loving Postino these days.  I am so, so happy that this in Gilbert.  This has become our favorite date night spot, particularly because of the $20 bottle and board deal on Monday and Tuesday nights.  $20 for a bottle of wine a bruschetta board?  Amazing deal.  They have a great patio, although I think it is going to be too hot to enjoy it in the near future.  

The atmosphere is fun and lively, and they play great music.  The bruschetta and other food is great.  They also serve brunch on the weekend mornings and that is tasty as well.  I do wish that they changed up their brunch and wine menu a little more often though.

Overall, totally fun place to go for a drink and some appetizers."}
{"text":"Amazing birthday dinner with my son! Yummy grilled cheese paired with the to-die-for roasted red pepper gouda soup! Super sensitive to my food allergies. Vegetarian friendly place. Awesome service and cozy, classy, chic atmosphere! Would definitely recommend this place to any individual or group!"}
{"text":"Postino is a modern restaurant and wine bar in a bustling area, which is nice that other things are walkable! Theres a huge free parking lot behind the building too, which is a plus! 
There's a vast wine selection, bottles for sale to take home, and even beer for non-wine drinkers. I love love loved the Riesling they had available. The menu is soups, salads, and sandwiches with some nibbley type foods to choose from as well. Definitely some low-cal options for those watching their figures. 
I recommend the cheese board, BUT they brought it with our food rather than beforehand like an appetizer should be, which was awkward. The service was SLOWWWWWWW, like unbelievably slow. However, everything we tried was tasty. 
The price range was higher tier for what's offered food wise, in my opinion, but the wine prices seemed standard."}
{"text":"Love this place! Mostly because I love bread and olive oil. I've been here twice and both times was really happy with the food and service. The atmosphere of the place is very open air, laid back, hang out, and eat slowly. The first time I came we got a board and there were two spreads I could eat, one was a fruity jam spread. It was really good. The second time I came a ordered a veggie sandwich and just got it without cheese. The server was great and when I told her I was vegan and had some food allergies she kept coming back with suggestions and modifications for things I could eat. She told me which breads I could have and put in a substitute sauce instead of a creamy sauce on the sandwich. Really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. Try to come in the evenings or in cooler weather so we can sit on the patio or by a window. Love the layout and how there's couches and it's very loungey. Great spot! :)"}
{"text":"Love the bruschetta, always have a difficult time picking only 4. Last time has the smoked salmon bruschetta, my wife had the tomato jam, and the requisite pistachio and date bruschetta we always get. This location is very quaint ina nice space. Had to wait a bit on a Fridat at 2:00pm, but the service was excellent. Great happy hour for glasses of wine."}
{"text":"I do not understand all the hype and high reviews. I have several friends that have raved about this place since they opened and I have personally seen the long wait lines to get in. DO NOT come here for the food, you will leave hungry and disappointed. It is a WINE bar with fancy-schmancy \"snacks.\" Service was good. Served quickly. Probably to get us out quickly. Music was loud. Front patio not as enjoyable due to all the car noise on the street. Again, I do not understand  the popularity of this restaurant. I will not be returning. P.S. I'm hungry."}
{"text":"I don't know why I have never left a review for one of my favorite places! my husband and I enjoy going here on our date nights... food is delicious ,great beer and wine ,staff is always so friendly and helpful, I have never ever had anything on the menu that is bad always delicious and flavorful... my husband loves the prosciutto and jam panini it sounds weird but it's really good!  they also have great outdoors seating and on certain days of the week live music...."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place since it opened. I must have missed something cause...it wasnt that great. The atmosphere was nice. The employees were nice. The wine and beer selection were nice....but when I go to a place with an Italian name like Postino's, I expect them to have an amazing Italian sandwich. The sandwich that I got was not amazing, not great, not good, not nice. Probably the worst Italian sandwich I've ever had. The little side salad that they served with it was money, but the sando needs some work. The meat was funky, the foccicia was oily and the spicy relish on it just tasted off. I'll go back again to give them another shot definitely need to order something else."}
{"text":"I ordered bruschetta to go the other day to share. I got a variety with: Salmon w pesto,
Apple w Brie & fig spread,
Prosciutto w dried fig & mascarpone , and 
Bacon w tomato & arugula 

The salmon with pesto was my favorite. The capers did them well to give it that little bit of acidity. 

The apple w brie fig spread I was hoping to be super refreshing but my apples tasted like garlic and lemon vs a nice sweet tart Apple to break into the richness of the Brie. 

Prosciutto with fig and the bacon w tomato arugula: maybe I had an off day and someone heavily salted the bread.. Both were so salty around the edges every bite hurt and my tongue shriveled. I didn't experience that I suppose with the other two because it wasn't being eaten with salty toppings. 

The arugula and tomato ate through the bread and I had a soggy mess. For those types I might even suggest requesting putting the toppings on the side to be constructed later. 

Minor disappointment - I don't remember it tasting like this when I dine in at their other restaurant. I'll have to give them a try sitting in. I know I know shame on me for being busy and ordering to go. Anyone have to go tips for this?"}
{"text":"What an outstanding opening party today... on St. Patty's day, none the less!
They opened for a select group of visitors from 2-6pm today and it included wine/beer and bruschetta for a cost of $25.  What a way to start off in the neighborhood!

I noted an excellent staff - friendly, prompt, and definitely well prepared for the onset of traffic that has been long awaiting the opening of this place.  Even when there were gobs of people in line for food and drink, they were kind, smiley and very up-beat.

The food was, as always, outstanding.  Great bruschetta variety and an impressive display of wines.

I'm excited this opened up in our neighborhood and I can't wait to come here again!"}
{"text":"The best bruschetta! Great time, every time!  This is a good place for a date or even a special event.  Plan to wait in line but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"A fun, modern atmosphere with a wide array of wines. The bruschetta board was spot on. Next time we will visit for a full meal."}
{"text":"My sister-in-laws haven't stopped talking about how we needed to try Postinos.  It turns out they couldn't have been more right.  We got to the restaurant just shy of 5:00 with the Happy Hour soon ending.  We ordered 2 bottles of wine at the Happy Hour price which served our party of 5 well for the rest of the evening.  We sat outside in a very nice booth.  The hostess rolled an outdoor heater over close enough to the table to take the rare chill out of the air, but not so close to be too hot.  We ordered 3 rounds of the bruschetta (at 4 toppings per round).  The traditional mozzarella and basil was as good as it is anywhere (how can you mess up this combo?).  What was pleasantly surprising were the many other bruschetta combinations.  The burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomatoes combo was a repeat order and we probably should have ordered 2 at a time.  It was hard to feed all 5 with 4 sections of bruschetta.  The salami and pesto was also a favorite and ordered twice.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My sister-in-law had been telling me about this place for a few years but we'd never gotten around to trying it. Over Thanksgiving weekend we finally made it there with her and her husband. I wish we'd tried it sooner! We had a really great time and the food was delicious.

We came right at the tail end of happy hour so we got the individual beer pitcher special. Five bucks for a pitcher? I'd be a total alcoholic if I lived in Gilbert. The beer selection is pretty good and those individual pitchers are not tiny. They also have a really great wine selection. My sister-in-law and I had the Sangiovese and we both loved it.

At her recommendation, my husband and I got a bruschetta board. You get to pick four of their unique bruschettas and they're served on a cutting board. We liked all of the ones we tried but I think my favorite was the one with pistachios and figs...or maybe they were dates. I can't exactly recall. Did I mention how cheap the beer was? LoL I was tempted to order another board and try more varieties but the panini looked too good to pass up. It was really good and they split the order for my husband and I with no additional charge. 

The atmosphere was really nice. We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful fall weather. Even though the patio was packed it didn't feel crowded. Everyone has their own space. If we didn't have plans with our parents-in-law later that evening I could've eaten and drunk another round of everything. This place is at the top of my list the next time I visit my family in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I hate to give such a terrible review for a restaurant I love, but the food and wine just can't make up for the horrible service we received tonight. We sat at the outside bar, and he first bartender, Patrick, was wonderful. Attentive, pleasant, and made sure we didn't go more than a few minutes without acknowledgement (and he was busy!). Unfortunately, 30 minutes into our stay, he was tasked with other items and Steve took over. We went about 30 minutes with no acknowledgement whatsoever. We had empty glasses and tried repeatedly to gain his attention, but he apparently thought it was more important to hit on a girl at the other side of the bar than pay attention to his customers. Even when our friend joined us, he didn't take notice - another server stepped in and asked us if we needed anything. Overall it was quite a disappointing experience, especially from somewhere we frequent and have grown to enjoy. I'm sure I will be back, but I will avoid the bar if Steve is working."}
{"text":"Postinos really has a few things nailed down well:

- Price: I think it is Monday and Tuesday that you can get a bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta for $20 !!!.  The wine is not panther piss either and actually quite good so I challenge you to beat that deal.

- Style:  No matter where you are seated, you feel the great vibe and it's a great place to chill with a group of friends.

- Diversity:  Great bar area, lounge area, outdoor area, grass (fake) area with adirondack style chairs, and street view.  

- Quality:  The food is always pretty darn good.  I tend to drink more than I eat here and also never get disappointed by the beer selection.  My wife loves their \"house\" reds too.

On the down side some of the areas can feel a little cramped.  Some of the tables in the middle of the dining room feel right on top of others.  It is also always busy which though fun can be a bummer if you are trying to find a spot.  You almost have to have a plan of attack on a weekend to get some good digs.

If you haven't been, I'd suggest hitting it on off times or mid week and I'm certain you will enjoy it.  If Yelp supported half stars this would surely get a 4.5.  

Great to see another quality anchor for the DT Gilbert scene."}
{"text":"I must admit, I'm a massive fan of Postino Arcadia and Phx... Years ago, when I heard they were building a (Cue dramatic and skeptical voice) Giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiilbert location I turned up my nose. Fast forward a few years, I own a house down the road and am ECSTATIC to be eating and drinking my words at one of the best spots in Gilbert. I was worried that the unique charm and atmosphere wouldn't translate. I'll be honest, I still prefer Arcadia/Phx but am happy to say that they did a great job of transplanting this gem."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. I frequent almost once a week. The drinks, food, atmosphere so phenomenal. Very trendy but relaxed. Their happy hour is great and late night happy hour on Monday and Tuesday I have yet to try. Sometimes there is quite a wait but I can understand why for being one of the only places of its kind in the Gilbert area. Definitely have to try their bruschetta board. I've tried all of them and they all are very good though our faves are the Brie and apple, burrata bacon, and tomato jam. Totally obsessed with their pub board as their warm salty pretzels are killer. Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"We were so excited when we first heard that Postino's had opened closer to where we live ... It's definitely a great hangout spot! We've been there a couple of times now & have had the Bruschetta, the Grilled Cheese, & the Pub Board. I'd say that out of all the offerings, their bruschetta is definitely the best! The Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, the Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, and the Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios are my favorites. The Pub Board & Grilled cheese were quite good (especially since the Grilled Cheese came with a variety of dipping sauces & the Pub Board was pretty large), but they weren't as good as the bruschetta. If you're a wine drinker,  $5 for a glass is a pretty good deal. The only thing is that the wait times are normally really long, especially if you go in the evening and because most people enjoy sitting & drinking wine while chatting with their party, the wait times they tell you are normally not very accurate."}
{"text":"I got lunch here with based on my coworkers suggestion. The panini itself was good, the issue was how I had asked for the cheese on the side because my wife is allergic to dairy and I was sharing it for her. When I picked it up to go they assured me the order was complete, I get home and what do you know, the cheese is completely melted on the sandwich. I called in to let them know they messed it up, and they're just like, oh, I'll let the chefs know. There was no apology or a rain check for a corrected sandwich. It's getting harder to find competent service where they can get it right the first time. 

Edit: Stuff happens, but food allergies are important. Joe's Farm Grill has an excellent approach to handling allergies. All the grills are cleaned and the employees change gloves when making special orders. 

TL;DR
The food is great there, make sure the order is complete before leaving."}
{"text":"Loooove Postinos . 

If you live in the Gilbert area you know there are not that many places around and Postinos is quite the swanky spot. 

Great deals. Great for daytime drinking and eating. Close to all other places. Easy to walk around and great happy hour deals. You simply can't go wrong 

The bruschetta is amazing. Then again so is everything else. 

Will be back many more times."}
{"text":"Well the food is good. The wine is good our server totally ignored us. Took our order and brought the check. The other staff members were there to help us as we flagged them down - for wine, for the missing meal for our child, for drink refills, for everything. Our guy \"JT\" was busy chatting up a couple of ladies for 14 minutes while we waited to get someone's attention to order wine.  Unacceptable. 

We tipped because of the staff and let the young lady who identified as manger know how we were treated.  

We'll return but if this guy is still employed and we're seated with him, we'll either leave or request an alternate server. 

Like the place though...very much!"}
{"text":"Postino East is a great place to eat gluten free Bruschetta.  There are wine bottles everywhere.  The atmosphere here is lively and festive .  It is wide open with the inside flowing to the outside (the garage doors are always open).  This is such a wonderful place to be on this beautiful day in Gilbert Arizona.  Julie did a great job at the bar."}
{"text":"Another great find for gluten free options!! We had the grilled cheese appetizer which they made gluten free and it was out of this world!! The best gluten free grilled cheese we have ever had! Nothing in the menu is bad. Such a cute atmosphere!! We love having date nights here!"}
{"text":"Postino East is one of my favorite places to eat. The atmosphere is welcoming, and the quality of food is always amazing."}
{"text":"Went for a Sunday brunch - we were seated outside and The atmosphere and service were great. The food was good but not great. The bottle of champagne and carafe of orange juice for mimosas was way too expensive ($30)."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!!! The boards, the bread, the Beer!! Oh and my waitress was Beth and she's the Best! Look at all the B's!!!!! I highly recommend this place and even better the patio."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Utah and some friends told me this was their favorite spot. On our way walking up to the restaurant, my heel on my boot decided to break off. Laughing it off, we were seated at the couches and tried ourselves to attempt to get the shoe on. Within seconds, the manager appears at our table with superglue and comes over to aid me. Seriously? Incredible. After minutes of attempting to glue it back on, we chalked it up for a loss. After 20 minutes, he comes back with a power drill and says \"let's try this again\". He then attempted AGAIN to fix my shoe. I have never experienced better customer service than this place. This guy was incredible. Regardless of the food (which was the best artichoke dip and best bruschetta I've ever had) I rate it 5 stars from his kindness."}
{"text":"I have to say there is not much than can go wrong with a restaurant the specializes in wine, cheese and all things Italian.  Went on a Saturday night while a holiday fair was being had so getting to the location was a bitch.  Parking is pretty atrocious on a regular Saturday night let alone when an event is being held.  The service is efficient and friendly nothing out of the ordinary.  Food and wine is why you come here and why I keep going back. Thank goodness for the other locations which have better parking."}
{"text":"Try the bruschetta, my favorite was the goat cheese and pepper. The service was good and the place has a very trendy feel to it. The menu is limited but the good was good. It was loud and the music could be turned down a bit to be able to carry a conversation.  The outdoor area is really nice."}
{"text":"I love this place. 
It is a very cool set up - glass garage door, outside patio couch seating, great music. 
FINALLY  a cool place in Gilbert! 
My fiance and I have gone here a few times, and have yet to be disappointed. 
We've done a wine night, and light dinner/drinks. Both were great.
The bruschetta = amazingness. 
I would definitely recommend stopping in for a night out."}
{"text":"This is my absolute FAVORITE place to eat! It's expensive but so worth it! I love the people who work there, super hipster but it's cute! The cucumber honey lemonade and spicy mozzarella chicken sandwich keeps me comin back!"}
{"text":"Incredible value for happy hour.  Reasonably priced beer and wine and some great sandwiches.  Couple that with some of the friendliest wait staff in the area, and you have a winner."}
{"text":"The bruschetta/wine deal for $20 is fantastic.  My favorite brushettas are the apple and the salmon. Unfortunately when I went, my group had to sit under the outdoor misters, which were on full blast.  By the end of the night our clothes felt damp.  I also wish Postinos would take reservations."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner, brunch, and happy hour. I couldn't love a wine bar more than I do this one!....especially for Gilbert! Was there last night and although we waited a good hour to be seated it was WELL worth it. I got the bruschetta of course and so far I've yet to have a bruschetta there that didn't please me. They've got a great selection of wine (not beer though and honestly who wants beer at a wine bar anyway?). We got comfy seating very intimate, I would want a date to take me here for sure! The server was very attentive and I really believed her when she had eaten the menu items she was very knowledgable. If you want a great breakfast this place is the way to go seriously tasterific and the mimosas are abfab. Highly recommend this joint be prepared to wait on the weekends but enjoy a wine while you do because they have a server to assist."}
{"text":"Brunch. Came here because I was given a free brunch entree due to Arcadia's location reaching 1000 yelp reviews. As usual this place is packed. We were told a 45 minute wait but ended up only waiting 20 minutes! With a simple text we were notified our table was ready. While waiting outside they have a server to take drink orders which is an effective way to earn more business. Great job!

Weather was cool and crisp but got a table inside. At least the door walls were wide open. We immediately ordered from the brunch menu. I laid eyes on the Farm Scramble (which reminded me of Essence Bakery's French Scramble).  See below. This one had roasted Yukon potatoes meshed with onions, Gruyere cheese, cheddar white cheese, herbs. Quite tasty! I was not full from this so I luckily ordered an apricot scone. This was a nice treat. 

We also ordered the Morning Staple: 2 eggs cooked to your liking, bacon, walnut toast and roasted potatoes. When this plate came out the potatoes were lightly sprinkled over the eggs as garnishment. This might satisfy a petite woman but not so for a hungry man. Prepare yourself for another order of something else. After paying the bill only did we realize that we didn't get the bacon!! - the most wanted piece!! How did we miss that?! To our surprise the server came to us as we were walking away from the table and offered us a free bruschetta board for next time! Totally unexpected but cool! 

Stars taken away due to: no stirring spoon for coffee. Portion was just a little too petite. The missed bacon was made up for. 

On a side note: 
(Just because this was too similar I had to do a Comparison).

Farm: Roasted potatoes. Scrambled Eggs. Onions. Gruyere cheese. Herbs. White cheddar. Side salad greens and cherry tomatoes. Petite portion. $9.75. Delicious. 

French: Slow cooked scrambled eggs. Chives. Dijon Mustard. Cream. Parmesan Cheese With Homemade Buttered Toast & Jam. Decent portion.  $6.75. Add $2 for bacon or sausage.  Delicious. 

Overall: Although both are delicious the Better value would be the French Scramble."}
{"text":"I'm not a wine person. Sure, I'll hammer a whole box of Franzia around a campfire (true story) but I know little-to-nothing about wine. I'm the type of guy who orders white wine with steak. All I know is that if I am going to get wine and attempt to act like I know what I'm doing then I prefer rose, white, and red... in that order.

With that said, Postino is a place for people who enjoy the finer items of wine. This is a place where I could see aficionados discussing vineyards, swirling their glasses (in the correct glass for that particular wine), and making sure that their wine \"compliments\" their food selection. This would be the equivalent of bearded men wearing plaid talking about who brews their craft beer, what type of hops it has, and beating their chest about who has the best brewery setup in their closet at home. Don't get me wrong - both of these dances are fine in my book... I'm just giving you the vibe I get with Postinos (honestly, I'm exaggerating. The place is pretty normal).

The food here is pretty good. And, when in Rome, do as the Romans do - the wine was pretty good too.

If you like wine, this is probably a stop you should make in the lovely downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Wow.  Great atmosphere fun place  would like to come back here again service is good and friendly fun times. Happy hour could be a little longer til six maybe but great price on the glass of wine"}
{"text":"Really cool spot for happy hour or just to relax after work. The staff is amazing Jason at the bar was more then helpful. One of the best places I've been to since moving to Az about a month ago and definitely will be returning. Great wine and good vibes."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. The happy hour special was great. $5 dollar wines and $5 beer pitchers. And 4 different bruschetta's for $10."}
{"text":"Normally 5 stars at other locations but seems this one is a little bit less than.  Normally not the case but today tomatoes were not fresh on the bruschetta and he fruit flies, flies and bugs would leave us alone.  Bugs - okay doors are open, but fruit flies are result of bar issues.  Staff are still fantastic!"}
{"text":"As a fan of Postino in Arcadia I was really disappointed with my Postino experience in Gilbert.  We had a group of 7 and on a Friday night we knew that we wouldn't be easily accommodated.  With that said, the Postino in Arcadia is always more than willing to help large or small groups to feel comfortable even when they're slammed.

We arrived at 9pm, and the hostess told us that we could go to the first come first serve lawn area and have drinks.  This was fine with us, except the large lawn area probably has about 10 chairs total.  We decided to work with it, ordered 2 bottles of wine and 4 by the glass.  One end of the lawn had no chairs yet a heating lamp, while the other side had chairs and no lamp.  We asked the server if we could move the lamp once we finally were able to sit down, and he refused.  We also noticed a stack of chairs that weren't be used, and they said that we couldn't use them.  Very unaccommodating.  

I must say that the wine selection is great, but when the service sucks whats the point?"}
{"text":"This place is so LOVED by everyone of our clients that we decided to have a contest and give away two $25.00 Gift cards for Valentines Day the results were Great!!  I highly recommend everyone check it out on Monday and Tuesday after 8pm for a Great Deal $20.00 bottle of wine and bruschetta tray. Great friendly service and atmosphere.  My wife and I enjoy riding our bikes to Postinos on Monday nights what a great evening. We always take our out of town friends and they look forward to their next visit.  Be sure to have a designated driver. Just saying!!"}
{"text":"What's not to love? Delicious drinks and a really friendly hip wait or was the first thing I liked about this place.  There is lots of staff around and any were willing to be helpful by clearing our plates,  and making sure our glasses stayed full.  The bruschetta is LITERALLY something I craved for a week after I ate there and as I type this I'd like to get back.  We tried 4 different kinds,  one with butternut squash and pumpkin that I couldn't eat fast enough.  We ate outside and it was absolutely beautiful but even the inside would have been nice because it too has a cool atmosphere.  

Last note,  their happy hour is awesome and they have a few differ the specials during the week as well."}
{"text":"We had a lovely lunch on their patio. We each had a glass of rose (great prices on glasses of wine before 5:00) and split an order of bruschetta. You get 4 bruschetta's per order and the selections were all excellent. It was enough for the two of us to have a light lunch. Service was excellent. Actually, the gentleman that served our wine was very easy on the eyes! I will return..."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! Happy hour is until 5 everyday, with five dollar glasses of wine. The bruschetta is a must have, my fave was the warm artichoke. Atmosphere was exceptional, very open floor plan and modern decor."}
{"text":"If it's possible, my love for Postino has only increased. I decided to throw a baby shower for my friend here, and it turned out beautifully. I never had a problem with my calls being returned, and the managers I spoke to were extremely helpful and friendly.

We had our shower at the front of the restaurant which utilized both indoor and outdoor couches. We had the space for 2 hours plus they let us come in early to decorate.

Pricing is wonderful for a larger party. If you have the party inside the restaurant like we did, regular menu pricing applies. You could have it out on the lawn using the catering menu pricing which is an even better deal .I also love that they don't charge for bringing in a cake. You can order cookies through their sister restaurant Churn which is a great dessert option.

I fed a party of ten 4 bruschetta boards, a cheese board, bottle of wine, and \"mass-mosa\" (bottle of champagne + OJ carafe) for ~$10 a person plus tip. I pre-ordered some paninis too but ended up cancelling them at the last minute, and our waitress was very nice about it.

Overall, it was a fun, beautiful day, and our baby shower went very smoothly. I would host another party here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday night and was quickly told by which looked like a waiter that they were closed. It was only 10:15 so I'm not sure why the man said they were closed.
Never going back, a place like that doesn't deserve my business."}
{"text":"I love this place. My man and I sit at the bar and drink wine and beer and eat bruschetta. I don't always love the soup but I never dislike it. Tomatoes and mozzarella are a hit. Italian picnic salad is awesome. Even the grilled cheese rocks. Bartenders are always friendly especially the dude with the headband and the other tall guy who's name I always forget."}
{"text":"Wow. That music. They've clearly spent some time understanding acoustics, maybe they hired out an audio engineering? You can hear the proper stereo effects even when you haven't even stepped foot on the premises yet. THAT'S good design.

The wine selection is here is appropriate and the cheese boards are to die for. You MUST get a board, I recommend The Bounty, which their website currently describes as: \"Grilled cauliflower, asparagus, and a variety of vegetables served with Guindilla peppers, spicy Marcona almonds, herb cucumber cream dipping sauce and smoked almond hummus\"

Seating is plentiful, and service is kind. Come here often!"}
{"text":"We've been to Postino East for brunch before, but this was our first time at dinner. I wanted to order a light meal and the Tuna Nicoise was a perfect choice. I couldn't have been more happy. An abundance of tuna, fresh greens, hard boiled egg, gold potatoes, crispy green beans and an assortment of olives was absolutely delicious. I selected a red blend wine to complement my meal. Service was attentive and the lively atmosphere wasn't too loud to distract from dinner table conversation. I enjoyed our brunches at Postino - now dinner. We'll have to come back again and try out their wide variety of bruschetta."}
{"text":"Another great restaurant in downtown Gilbert.  Their food and drinks are great and my only semi-complaint is sometimes it seems like you don't get quite enough food for the price.  Otherwise highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I don't know why people love this place so much. The waits are always long. The food is average (bruschetta is so soggy! Ugh!). The location is premier so I can see the appeal of that. 
I did have a great holiday party there one year with good service (still bad food!). But other times service has been slow. 
Overall, low rating from me. Two stars is because they do have a decent happy hour."}
{"text":"I don't know how it took me this time to write a review! We love this Postinos location! My husband baby and I come here at least once a week for brunch. The staff is so great and the hostesses always remember us and are so sweet! Love them! I do wish they would bring back the tomato jam bruschetta but great that it's occasionally a seasonal. Stay amazing Postinos! :)"}
{"text":"To be honest - the lady next to me is complaining about pretty much everything and is being ridiculous. This obviously isn't her type of restaurant. She just threatened to post on Yelp, so I'm dropping a much deserved 5 star rating to counter act her silliness."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere in this place. The wine selection is good and the bruschetta is delicious. I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"The service here is exceptional. The food is delicious, a lot of flavor in smaller portions which is perfect for social occasions. The set up they have for the dogs is really neat too!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with what was certainly an unfair beginning bias. I have long been a fan of Fifth and Wine. It was my first wine bars, and still holds a firm grip on my affections, preconceived notions and standards. 

That gotten out of the way, I really enjoyed Postino. They decor was skillfully designed to project casual minimalist and hipster sophisticated simplicity. The place was jam packed at 8 pm on a Wednesday evening, one of the raw spectacles that is such a stark opposition to Payson life that I very often now find myself absorbing the fascinating juxtaposition. But total sidebar aside, the Argentinian Merlot was pristine. It seemed unpretentious in its offering of beers as well. We ordered a bowl of olives that was not even close to being on my radar, but Helena insisted and I am stoked that she did. About half a dozen varieties, and all of them were gorgeous and paired with the bruschetta plate and wine. 

The bruschetta bread was a bit soft and thick for my liking. I prefer the crisper thinner cut on the bread, but totally just my personal preference. Some might prefer the doughy bread texture for their app. We chose our four to include a selection of savory and sweet; classic Margherita, white bean paste with tomatoes (we added pesto), warm artichoke spread, and ricotta with pistachio and date. Not a single one disappointed.

 The waitress was genuinely likable, accommodating and very helpful 

I chose a ciabatta sandwich with a nice brie, fig jam and prosciutto, garnished with arugula. Helena had black bean soup. Both were really well crafted with full complex bold flavors. The food menu was simple but all of it was perfectly matched to the wine. There was a lot of moaning and nodding going on during the meal, which is always a good sign. 

The price points were also a really nice surprise. Very moderate for a good clean well constructed food. We will definitely be returning to travel through the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I'm a wine and bruschetta lover. Therefore, I naturally love Postinos.The ambiance of this location is great, it has the perfect amount of sunshine on the patio. Staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Sunday brunch service can be a little slow but overall Postinos is a great brunch spot and they have great offerings on wine by the glass & bottles."}
{"text":"I tried Postino's on a Saturday night for a first date. The restaurant-ish bar was clean and attractive, although not exactly conducive to a first date for me as I prefer a quiet setting so I can hear the conversation.

We selected wines recommended by the server and they were good. The food menu was very limited because, as I understand it, they don't have a 'real' kitchen in which they can prepare regular fare. We started with a meat and cheese tray which was over-flowing with nuts, cheeses and cuts of meat I've never seen, heard of, or tasted before. Some were ok, but one of the meats in particular was absolutely horrible. In all fairness, I'm a picky eater, so perhaps it was just me and not the meat. 

I ordered a chicken panini for my entree. It took a while to get our food and unfortunately, it wasn't worth the wait. I had not had a panini in years and was looking forward to what I remembered being a fantastic, crunchy but gooey mess of chicken and cheese.... sadly, the consistency was more like what I expect tofu would be like. It was mushy through and through. The bread was mushy and the chicken was pasty. It was disappointing to say the least.

Overall, my visit was 'ok'. My date thought it was better than I, she probably would have given it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Love the fun atmosphere and food is awesome!  Very clever way to present an assortment of bruschetta. My mouth is still watering! Cheese boards were great as well! Sandwiches are incredible!  Nothing they serve is bad! A place not to go if you're trying to keep your figure! Ate too much! The they blend their food the way they do and when it all comes together is like heaven. Go early, cuz dinner time it's a zoo!!  

My only complaint was the service... Really slow if the place is busy.  My suggestion is to go before it gets too busy."}
{"text":"A new favorite for us. Great food and atmosphere with reasonable prices. The combo deal for $10 is a winner."}
{"text":"My favorite spot!! The bruschetta boards are incredible. I would eat here daily if I could."}
{"text":"The service here leaves a lot to be desired. I came as part of a large group for a celebration. We tried to make reservations 2 weeks in advance for our group of 10+ but were told they don't take reservations. The day of we tried to at least give them a head's up that a large group was planning to come in and were told that they in fact do take reservations for larger groups, but couldn't provide us with a reservation on the day of. Excellent.
We waited for about an hour and a half for our tables, which was understandable because they were busy and there was a lot of us. The bartender was very nice and brought drinks out to us in the yard, but put everything on one check, and it wasn't an easy process to split.
The food was good, I had the Autostrata and a butcher block appetizer. The block was amazing. Their hummus was out of this world, and should really be featured on its own. The staff was nice, but not entirely attentive. I would have ordered another beer but didn't see our server again until it was time to leave.  The music is loud, but good. 
At the end of the meal we encountered more check splitting issues. It took about a half hour to get straightened out. The issues kind of put a damper on the evening, which was disappointing. 
Over all, the food is good, keep your party small and expect issues when it comes to check splitting."}
{"text":"I did Happy Hour here 3pm on a Friday afternoon. The place was packed. The hostess told me it woud be a 20 minute wait since there were to be 5 in my party and offered me the patio. I kind of rolled my eyes at that one. I mean, August in Arizona on a patio with no misters? Really? Fortunately, I spotted a friend who had spotted a table that was just being cleaned. We nabbed it and the hostess was kind enough to bring another chair without our asking. Nice.

Postino's itself is a small place. I wish it were larger as it is very popular. The music is much too loud for comfortable conversation, as well. 

After a chat with Shawn about the wine/beer list, we ordered. Friend had a merlot thst she relly enjoyed while I had a pinot grigio which disappointed. After viewing my attempts to like it, Shawn approached and offered me a different beverage. However, I was not staying long, so I declined. Ten minutes later, he returned with a bottle of beer I had mentioned was my favorite and whisked away the offending pinot. Is that AMAZING service or what? 

On to the food. Friends tried a bruschetta selection and the mozzarella/tomato/basil appetizer. While I am told the bruschetta was excellent, the mozzarella was bland. If not for the tasty pesto, she likely would not have finished it. 

Another word about the service. Although the place was packed, we were given attention from three servers, one of whom brought multiple orders of the pesto for my friend.That's attentive to the max.

I give Postino East four stars for the stellar service and tasty bruschetta. I will likely be back when the temps cool a bit."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite place to go for celebrations. I love all of the locations and the atmosphere. Their rotating wine selection is great and who can beat $5 glasses? The bruschetta (all of them) are seriously the best! Pick and combination of bruschettas to try and you will not be disappointed. Don't pass up dessert either - the creme brulee or the salted caramel sundae and both delectable!"}
{"text":"I love Postinos! I've only been here for Mondays and Tuesdays $20 bruschetta and wine specials. You get a full bottle of wine and four big pieces of assorted bruschetta. Perfect amount to split between two! Can't go wrong with any of the flavors of bruschetta. There's usually not a wait which surprises me, because it always seems busy."}
{"text":"I had lunch on a Friday. There is a wait, so I recommend reservations. The food was fabulous! I had half a sandwich and salad. Absolutely no complaints with the food. It was busy, so we did have to wait a little while to get our check."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with indoor outdoor feel. Sit down style restaurant bit more on the fancy side but it is a wine bar after all.

Went for brunch and had BLT with egg and it was mighty tasty. Need to go back and try more."}
{"text":"We loved this place.  Good happy hour....fun place to hang out.  Good drinks and delicious bruschetta boards.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Just ok. Came here for Monday happy hour after 8pm. We waited forever to be seated after being 'forgotten'. Then found out they were out of wine glasses. Really, a wine bar who runs outs of wine glasses. The bruschetta bread was hard and just ok. Wine was ok as well, but nothing to write home about. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I love their bruschetta! My favorite is the ricotta, date and pistachio. My friend and I had the creme brulee which was very good and she likes the cucumber lemonade. If I liked cucumbers it would've been good, but the cucumber taste was overpowering for me. Another time, I had the apricot scone which was actually made how scones should be, crispy outside, tender inside. It was excellent. we always have good service too."}
{"text":"So so place.  I guess its nice to have in downtown Gilbert but whoever they have expediting their food orders needs to be fired.  My gf and I were the 4th table sat at Lunch and it still took 40 minutes to get 2 half/half sandwich/salad orders.  40 MINUTES!!!! Are you serious?  Can you imagine going to paradise bakery or wildflower and waiting 40 minutes?  The service is good and the waiters and waitresses kept the drinks full and kept apologizing for the wait.  The food is so-so.  My salad had a million onions, but my gf's was just right.  The panini's were nothing to write home about.  I guess I would go back if a bunch of friends wanted to go and hang out for the wine but I wouldn't go back again for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"No self respecting New Yorker (as I am) would continue to allow the \"NYC Grilled Cheese\" on the menu here without calling it out! Just call it \"Grilled Cheese\" and leave us out of it because it's not good! No NY diner would serve this!  The bruschetta was good though. The prosciutto is the best and if the bread was toasted slightly it would have been perfect!"}
{"text":"squint your eyes and push out your lips first and then read the next sentence in a super pompous jerk voice.....\"ill take your finest pinot and goat cheese bruschetta board\".......you have just impersonated 73% of the people that go here. the other 27% are super indie looking kids with original septum piercings and very cool Indian feather tattoos on their shoulder blades. The wait staff are super chill and cool about everything. The beer is aight and I am a man so I don't drink wine. That last comment just fired up the majority of Postinos patrons.....im outta here!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome i like the look of the restaurant. The waiters are so friendly as well. I love their tuna nicoise salad and their sandwiches. So eager to try their soup on my next visit"}
{"text":"Probably the best place in down town Gilbert. this place is really what brought the cool modern vibe to DTG and has kept with the new restaurant boom that has happened recently. It is always busy so expect a wait but the wait is well worth it. Amazing food. Great drinks. Awesome atmosphere. They have great deals through out the week. Their brunch is one of the best brunches I have ever been to. Their french toast is my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"This is one of my year long cravings. Their bruschetta is the best. Good prices love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Waiting two hours just to get two chairs without a table? No thanks..I'll come back in a few months when the shiny wears off a bit. We had high hopes based on the PHX location, but if you're making we wait two hours to get seated, you should let me know ahead of time that we could end p without an actual table when we get seated. The antipasti at the bar was good, but I'll come back and give a more thorough evaluating. Until then, Liberty Market still wins in service without having actual table service."}
{"text":"I'm going to make this nice, short, and sweet.

Jesse was our server, he did a fantastic job. Duncan, among 2 or 3 others helped ensure our evening was as expected, dropping in, removing dishes off our table. Justin, the manager, whom we spoke to last night about the superb service, they all are incredible. I can't speak highly enough of these three gentlemen and the service they provided.

It was my first time here, at the recommendation of my date. We had the bruschetta board, bottle of wine ($20 for both on Monday's and Tuesday's after 8pm) and we shared panini. It was spectacular. Never had bruschetta before, not sure what to expect but we have concluded that Postino's is going to be our Monday or Tuesday evening go-to each week.

I wish I could award these guys a 6th star, they really did a great job at ensuring we were happy."}
{"text":"Downtown Gilbert is so family friendly it can make the most diehard single guy gag. That is why it was surprising to see all the happy gilbert folks dishing out scottsdale prices for their bread covered in toppings. The food, while overpriced and smallish portions to share, is pretty decent and decent looking. I only managed to share a cheese board on the first half of an eventual failed two-tier date. The board had three cheeses of your choice and the hard cheddar was the best pick out of the brie and another one that looked like cottage cheese. The rest of the board had six small pieces of bread (half toasted, half not), a bunch of mixed nuts and good apriot jam and regular dried apricot. Not sure of the happy hour deals on food, but if you can get it half off the $15, it would be a deal.
   Basically, the place gets a good review because we were there between 11 and 5pm and all glasses of wine were five bucks. Now, that is a deal and a good way to make out with your date soon after."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of wine. Delicious bruchetta! I like the environment and it being settled in downtown Gilbert. Hit  or miss with  service hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"First time here and it was excellent. They have gluten free bread so my girlfriend got to experience bruschetta for the first time in years!!!! Hour wait for inside seating but immediate seating outside and even though the temp was 108, the misting system kept it a cool 90 and i didn't even break a sweat. Service was also great, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Postino in Gilbert. The food was amazing and the wine selection is fantastic. The menu is limited to appetizers, salads, and panini's. The quality of the food is amazing! These cheese and tomato dish is to die for! The wait times can be a little lengthy, however they do have cocktail and appetizer service on the patio while you wait. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I had a great time! We ordered the cheese plate and it was amazing with huge chunks of cheese, the only thing I didn't like is we didn't have enough bread for all of the cheese! I should have asked but I also would expect the waiter to notice that we were out with lots of cheese left, and it's not cheese you can just eat with your  fingers. I love that there were fresh grapes on the platter and a bunch of munchies like almonds, dried cranberries and apricots. Water was always full too so that's a plus. My aunt and cousin ordered the sparkling sauvignon blanc (recommended by me because I thought it might be good) they seemed to enjoy it! 
The only reason I took away one star is because I didn't feel like the service was exceptional, he didn't spend a lot of time with our table and asked quickly if my aunt wanted another glass of wine and she said no so he quickly asked if we wanted the bill. I wish he had asked if we wanted dessert because I completely forgot that I wanted dessert!
I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this joint.  The wine and the food is really good.  I've recently become more adventurous with my food and this has really come in handy when trying their bruschetta.  I've tried almost all of them and they are all pretty good.  I haven't been for their awesome happy hour on Monday's and Tuesday's but it sounds amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow! I never thought I would find a place like this the sleepy little town of Gilbert! Surprisingly they have enough options for someone who doesn't eat pork, beef or seafood to be stuffed when they leave. Their specialty is bruschetta - but not in the traditional sense (although they have one that is a traditional but is not spectacular). I had the white bean, the tomato jelly, the brie and fig and the traditional. I have to say the white bean and the tomato jelly were fantastic! Being a poultry-a-tarian and having no chicken options available, I had to go vegetarian and was limited to 5 options. One board is more than plenty to feed one person and 2 boards are sufficient for 3 people. The wine selection is pretty good as is the beer selection. They have some micro brews so you won't be stuck with a bud or miller lite! Each time I have been here I have had to wait, but it is so worth the wait. The children's' menu is standard, but they all come with a wacky little animal that will keep your little monster occupied for quite a while. Also, they have quirky little things that makes them stand out - for instance there is a bocce ball grassy area that you can sit by and play while you eat and there are these cute little yellowish orange cards in the sugar holder that are specifically for your gum (stop wasting the sugar people!). I hear that there is a special on Tuesday nights that gets you any bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20 - I also hear that the wait is ridiculous so I haven't ventured out there on a Tuesday night yet, but I am thinking that the savings may be worth the wait! All in all a great place to take a small party and enjoy in non traditional bruschettas with fantastic wine and beer!"}
{"text":"OK, I like this place. I was pleasantly surprised on my first visit.

I was extremely happy with the happy hour beer specials, but not so impressed with the beer selection. I am a hop-head and I love a good, dank IPA. Their happy hour draft selection was Oskar Blues Pinner and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale: neither of these hit the mark.  I can accept the session ABV's, but it is IPA light in flavor. Despite my pickiness, at $5 for a personal pitcher (about 2.5 pints total) is a killer deal. My wife had $5 glasses of wine, a good value as well.

The half sandwich and salad I had were very good. I could eat the Sunshine Daydream salad all day long. It is the right combo of sweet and savory, crunchy and creamy. The 9 Iron sandwich was adequate, but it simply didn't deliver in flavor and my chicken breast was skimpy compared to the abundance of bread.

The atmosphere is pleasant for all. There was an interesting mix of bikers, hipsters, punks, and the conventional. I found a gaggle of Stepford Wives in the \"play\" area rather amusing as they were pairing up their 1-3 year old aryan children and telling them that this other pre-motorskilled child was their future life-partner. Ah, the breeding pool of the middle-class Caucasians. The \"master plan\" of world dominance is still alive and strong while being managed during happy hour wine festivities at the local spot. Is this common in the Phoenix area? I digress...

I can recommend this place for good food, excellent booze happy hour specials, and an interesting mix of people to watch. Check out this place and maybe you too can gander at the vapid locals plotting to take over the world via their offspring. It is amazing what a $5 glass of Pinot can do for the world's population.

Go for the salads. Good salads. You will not find another review in my Yelp profile that proclaims such things."}
{"text":"Great wines and location!! 

This place is awesome for a place to relax and have a nice time with family/friends. HUGE win selection and great appetizers."}
{"text":"Went on a recent date night for bruschetta board & bottle of wine... for 20 bucks.  I miss Mondays and Tuesdays so much.  Please find your way out to Santa Barbara, Postino.  I need you."}
{"text":"The wife likes her bread. She eats a A LOT of bread. Throw some pretty and colorful stuff on top and she goes crazy. This is a good distraction tactic!

$5 mimosas for her and $5 pitchers of beer for me. They also have a decent collection of wine. We always get a $14.75 bruschetta board and we split a salad. Postino's is pretty chill about splitting the salad for you. They also have soups, salads, panini, and dessert.

No matter which location you go to, the atmosphere is always perfect. Take your hunnie here if you want some honey in return. ;)"}
{"text":"The service at first was slow we had 3 different servers, however, our 3rd and final server (sorry I forgot his name) was awesome, he was attentive and on top of our table made sure my niece was well taken care of which for me was amazing. I would go back if I could sit in his section again. This was my first visit to this location, food was inconsistent especially on the butchers board. The meat, cheese, olives & the nuts were about the only thing consistent with it. The bruschetta's 2 were good and the other 2 well we didn't even finish them. Like I said this was the 1st time I had something at any of the Postino's that was just ok."}
{"text":"Love this classy restaurant! It's a nice place to come with family, friends, and co workers! The patio setting is very relaxing especially with the live music they have playing one nights. The food is delicious and the wine selection is great! Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now when visiting friends in the Phoenix area. The first time was for their Monday & Tuesday night bruschetta and wine deal, which is a great deal. I won't be in town for that deal this time so today we headed over for a late lunch. My husband, toddler, myself and one of my friends are all gluten free and being able to have their gluten free bruschetta is one of lives luxuries. The bread is crunchy but still chewy and tastes normal, not gluten free. All the bruschetta options are excellent and it's nice that you get 4 options for a board. The service is exceptional and laid back but attentive. We've sat outside both times and unlike other restaurants where you loose service, this wasn't the case. The waiter gave us wine and food suggestions and offered other options if we didn't like what he suggested. He also came back to check up on us frequently but not too much it bugged us. This is one of those places I look forward to visiting and will return on every trip to the area."}
{"text":"YummO!  Went for brunch today with the husband.  Nice change of pace for us. The staff was very helpful and friendly.  They asked if this was our first visit, and since it was we were given the scoop on the menu. So the menu is small but what is there is done well. I had the french toast which was amazing, light fluffy and tasty. My husband ordered the farm scramble and he loved it! Eggs & salad? I wouldn't have guessed that this would make him happy but it did. Overall we are super happy with this place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan! Postino's has the market on Bruschetta... it is scrumptiously delicious! I have tried their salads, sandwiches, desserts and all were excellent. And the Butcher Block was amazing! They also have the market on the best pitcher price for great beer, not just domestics, crafts as well for only $5 until 5pm... what a steal! Also on Monday & Tuesday nights they have a House bottle of vino & an order of Bruschetta for only $20, another great deal. Atmosphere is nice, relaxed and fun. Service has been good, very friendly & knowledgable. It can get very busy and have a long wait but if you plan ahead, you will be eating and drinking in no time at all... Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Bruschetta is fabulous. The apple and brie was my favorite. I chose the pick two option for the meal. The side salad and half panini was plenty of food and had great flavor.  Service was great!"}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. This location is packed regularly and it can become a bit loud and the wait is long which is why I did not rate it higher. Food is quality and the product is consistent. Great wine selection and the cheese plate is top notch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend tells me we are going to Arizona to visit his friends. I do some Yelping and respond with...if you take me to this wine bar (and a fried chicken place) I found, I will be a happy camper on this trip. He agreed. 

He kept up his end of the bargain, we went to both places I wanted to go. I tried to be good, but i'm not perfect. Postino East, however, is.

We got there around 5:30 and there was no wait. When we left the line was out the door. This place is super cute, and huge! There is a bar, a large dining room, a large outdoor patio, and a large yard with little tables to sit at. Service was perfect the entire time. Food was served very fast. The portions are huge and the prices are very good.

Not knowing how large all the portions were, we ordered three things. Two would have been fine, but we ended up being able to take a good amount of food back to his friend's house for them to eat.

Wine and beer selection were good. You can get a freshly made mimosa or bellini for only $5. All wine is $5 a glass before 5:00 PM, after that none of the wine is more than $12, most of the wine was $9 - $10 a glass. I had one bellini, delicious. I also had a glass of Pinot Grigio from Italy that I enjoyed a lot. BF had a beer of some sort that he liked, so he ordered a second one.

Pub Board - This amazing wooden board is covered in yummy soft, salty pretzels, a spicy mustard, chorizo, an assortment of pickles, aged cheddar, and the best corn nuts I have ever had. Everything was perfect.

Bruschetta - For $14 you can choose four different kinds of bruschetta from a list of twelve. We went with Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato, and Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. The portion is MASSIVE! We ended up taking half of this back to our friends. I did like that each piece of bread is sliced into four small pieces so it is easy to eat and easy to share. All of the selections we made were wonderful, with my favorite being the Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. The pesto on the salmon bruschetta was amazing. No complaints about any of our choices. 

Nine Iron Panini - The Pub Board and Bruschetta were brought out before the panini, and once we saw how much food we were dealing with, we asked if the panini could be cancelled, but they had already made it. Luckily, they served it on two plates so we could share, so we ended up just sharing one half and taking the other one to our friends. This panini had chicken, bacon, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato and a dijonnaise. We were given a choice of ciabatta or focaccia bread. We went with ciabatta and it was a bit too hard for our taste, focaccia would have been better. The dijionnaise was very strong and was the main thing I tasted in this panini. It was a good sandwich, but my least favorite of the three things we ordered. What I did love though, were the potato chips served on the side. They were huge, crispy, salty, tasted just like Lay's, but not at all greasy! The best chips, ever.

The bill for our four drinks and all the food was about $65. Great deal for how much we had. Postino needs to bring it's perfect little ass out to California. If not, I will happily agree to go visit his friends again...IF we get to eat here :)"}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful service, always consistent.  I love their happy hour menu and the staff is always competent.  Aside from the hipster vibe that has swept this particular, once little, farming town, I like this place a lot."}
{"text":"Best bruschetta boards, great wine selection and yummy olives! This place holds a special place in my heart!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Postino - probably more than I should, definitely more than my hips should. My fiance and I went out to celebrate work promotions and my request was simple, bruschetta and wine from Postino, please. We loved the outdoor atmosphere, the fact that for once there was no wait (WHAT?) I know, on Tuesday at 6PM there was no wait. Our server was kind and knowledgeable.

We devoured our bruschetta and I had a nice glass of cab. We tried it with some balsamic, which we haven't done in the past and that was also great. The thing about Postino is that they keep so consistent with good food and drink. They have a great product and they don't let it slip. 

The experience was great and we would love to stop in again (pending no 2-hour wait) to try more of what they have to offer and relax on the patio."}
{"text":"To start off, I'd like to say that we thoroughly loved our busboy, Sean, who was first day out of the kitchen. He was a sweetie. 
We had a 30 minute wait, which was alright, but seating on the 'lawn' was not very good for a group of 5 trying to converse. 
The menu isn't very big, offering few choices. I did, however, like the bruschetta with a gluten free option. 
My opinion is that it is overpriced for the quantity and quality of food and beverages. The bottle of wine we shared was definitely overpriced. 
I will say that the server and busboy were very attentive. I did like the atmosphere as well, although the music could've been turned down, especially if seated inside. 
Would I come back here? Perhaps, especially since the weather is getting really nice, and I like a good patio which they offer here."}
{"text":"WE LOVE THIS PLACE! I went to the original in Phoenix a few years ago and was ecstatic when they brought one to Gilbert. My go-to is the bruschetta, but I also love their mixed greens salad!

My only complaint is that it is extremely loud and therefore I no longer go unless it is early in the day and during the week."}
{"text":"I've been here five times now and I have to say, I was a little reluctant to come here initially but now I'm hooked.  I love the food.  The bruschetta is amazing!  I've been here during the lunch and dinner hours and it's always crowded, but then again it's Gilbert and not much else here.  The only drawback to this place is the crowd and always a wait and it can be loud.  I'm not a wine drinker so I don't know about their wine selection but their beer selection is ok.  They have a few craft beers and the regular domestic garbage like Bud light."}
{"text":"This place is great for all size groups. Cute outdoor space and great location along Gilbert road. Wish the bathroom had a changing table, otherwise you can make do with the dresser they have in the bathroom. I love their bruschetta boards and you can't go wrong with $5 mimosas, or pitcher special before 5pm. Go on Mon/Tue to take advantage of their wine and bruschetta special."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot on Monday and Tuesdays! The staff is great (especially Austin) and he's also easy on the eyes .  I definitely recommend this place to anybody and everybody!"}
{"text":"We are currently sitting here at the bar at Postino's East.  I was on the fence about what to order for breakfast and Jax ordered us up one of the new menu items, Crepes with a Carmel, banana, topping. They aren't super sweet if that's what your worried about.  If your unsure order them I swear you'll love them."}
{"text":"Nice place. Food is good. Lively, a little loud if you are wanting to talk. I liked the raspberry chicken salad and we had a bruschetta platter."}
{"text":"Here it is. Tonight was perfect. The atmosphere. The lighting. The ambiance. And the food was amazing. McKenna was our waitress and made the night better. She wasn't a bother. Was fun.  And there when we needed her. 

Thank you!! We will be back. Ps ask her about the zebra."}
{"text":"One of my most favorite places to go Sunday afternoons. We loved going here because of the live music on Sundays. AJ Odneal is an awesome singer/song writer. She plays a few different instruments and is very talented. The food and drinks are also pretty good. Great for groups. I love this place during AZ spring & winter. They have heat lamps and outdoor seating. You can also take your dog as long as its in the grassy patio area."}
{"text":"We headed out to Postino on Thursday night for one of our girls happy hours. We enjoy trying new places and are always looking for a fun, comfy place with good food and drinks. We loved the design of the place and the garage doors were a great look and in cooler weather I am sure makes for a much nicer experience. We got there a little after 5pm and found all the tables were full. We were expecting a bit bigger place but it was really hot out and no one was sitting on the patio so really wasn't their fault. Although once they turned the misters on people started to sit outside. The guy who greeted us at the door was very friendly and said it would be a bit but if we wanted to we could check out the drink menu and order something while we waited. They offered us half a couch and we chose to try that instead of standing. It was an ok place but not really that comfortable for more than two people and made conversation a bit difficult. We told them we still wanted a table and they were great about it. They got us one in about 15 minutes and helped us bring our drinks over. The drink menu was a bit short and the after happy hour prices were a bit high. Two of us ordered wine ($9 and $10 a glass each) and our other friend ordered a beer (much better price) The wine was fine but nothing spectacular. They had a good selection of appetizer and happy hour type foods. We chose the bruschetta. The smoked salmon with pesto was my favorite, i could have eaten a lot more of that. We also got the Bella Postino, artichoke dip and white bean hummus with a variety of breads. The artichoke dip was great but the hummus was very bland. We had a couple different servers and it seemed like every server in the place stopped by our table at one point or another. They were maybe a bit too attentive. Three people asked if we needed another drink within 10 seconds of each other. One server was very concerned that every item we finished with was removed immediately. While I appreciate fast service this was a bit ridiculous. They had a small offering of desserts and one had chocolate covered corn nuts in it. We were intrigued and ordered that one. It was their Salted Caramel Sundae which consists of Vanilla bean ice cream with chocolate covered corn nuts, a pretzel stick and salted caramel. It was AWESOME! and the corn nuts were so tasty. who knew! Overall the prices were a bit high. The atmosphere was cool, the food good, the wine ok and the dessert wonderful. We had a pleasant time but it probably won't make the short list for future outings."}
{"text":"Best beer happy hour around and still a huge fan of their bruschetta and the nine iron sandwich. Wines are also great at $5/glass and there's actually a selection instead of just house red or white. Come on a weekday before 5 to avoid the crowd. Our waitress offered to split the check but messed it up afterward. My order of preference amongst the Postino's is Arcadia, East, then Central."}
{"text":"Great food! Excellent service.  My friends and I get together here at least once a month. You can customize your bruschetta board so everyone can share a board and still get exactly what you want."}
{"text":"Always a good time! Bruschetta is amazing here and always plenty of wine options. Love the little romantic patio, has little twinkly lights hung and heaters when needed. I have had some fantastic servers here, as well as some very unfriendly ones, seems inconsistent with staffing."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Postinos. I make it a point to stop by each time I'm in town. 

I'm posting today because about a month or so ago, I was having brunch with about 7 or 8 of my girlfriends.  I'm always so impressed with how smoothly everything operates. Seriously, this place is a well oiled machine.Anyway, our servers were so diligent with us and so lovely.  What really made us happy though, is that apparently it took our food a little bit longer to hit our table, so to make up for it the Manager came to our table to apologize and gave us a bunch of coupons. We were so shocked because we didn't even notice lol. Great great service. 

See you soon Postinos"}
{"text":"I have visited Postino East twice now and both were very good experiences and consistency.  The atmosphere is great. It can be very noisy on a weekend evening with long waits,  but it's worth the wait. The inside & outside space is great. 

I cannot go here without ordering the bruschetta. I've tried 7 different kinds so far and they're all very delicious. The roasted bell pepper with goat cheese,  the apple & brie and the smoked salmon are wonderful. I am a big fan of charcuterie so the butchers block and the cheese block are the way to go. You won't be disappointed I promise. 

Give it a try. Your tummy will thank you"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant - you can't beat the $5 glasses of wine, and the Bruschetta is so incredible.  My favorites are:  Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios; Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese; and Brie & Apples with Fig Spread.  I have seen reviews commenting on slow/poor service, but I have never experienced it.  My servers have always been quick, accomodating and friendly.  I will make this a regular haunt, well worth the drive from Mesa to Gilbert."}
{"text":"Postino's never disappoints me. Good appetizers, sandwiches, love the varieties bruschetta , and yummy dessert too! Love to go for a girls night out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Postino East for the first time last night and we were happily impressed by our experience. Our server was really friendly and upon learning we were first-time visitors, he came back with a couple of samples of soup (both were really good). He also advised us against ordering a bunch of dishes and recommended that we order course by course if we were still hungry after our first selection. We decided to split the bruschetta board (choose 4 types) and it was more than enough for the 2 of us. My Bellini was refreshing, husband's beer was good, and the bruschetta (bruschetti?) were tasty and chock-full of fresh ingredients. For his final tip, our server told us that Monday and Tuesday nights featured a wine and bruschetta special: enjoy 1 bottle of wine and the bruschetta board for $20. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everything about the experience was great (except the wait time, but it was worth it). Every member of the staff was extremely attentive, even while we were still waiting for our table. Everything we tried was amazing. My favorites: prosciutto, fig, and cheese  bruschetta and the creme br√ªl√©e, though I'm sure everything else is great as well. Wish I would have come here sooner!

It is a little pricey, especially if you're going to get drinks, but it's great if you're wanting a special night out or wanting to splurge. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"If I had reviewed Postino's East when they first opened, they would have gotten five stars. Service is slower, music is louder now. I went at 4pm on a stormy Thursday so it was a better-than-expected experience. When I've gone later in the evening, I've experienced a lack of service (like no one filling water, asking if we want more wine or food). More than once I've complained. They give a coupon for a free appetizer; I'd rather have the app I ordered (twice) comped immediately. It's go-to for location only. Glad to see more choices available in the area."}
{"text":"Love the staff, atmosphere, food, wine ALL OF IT!! They have an amazing selection of wine and bruschetta! Will always recommend this place."}
{"text":"Postino East was a ray of sunshine amongst some recent and thoroughly mediocre food adventures.  We started with \"The Bounty\" as an appetizer, and let me tell you if we had ordered two then we just would have eaten twice as much of it. Fantastic.  We then had two orders of the bruschetta (so 8 types total), which was a great amount for the four of us on a double date.  The food was gourmet, the atmosphere warm and inviting.  This was one of the best dining experiences we'd had in a long while and a great date to boot.  Five stars!!"}
{"text":"I had a negative review before but was given an chance to go back and experience Postino's again and I want to say it was a 100% better experience for me. Since that visit too, I went back several times and have been very happy with the service and food and of course the wine. The bartender even was able to give me recommendations on one of the wines and I was very pleased. I will have to go back during a happy hour so it doesn't do as much damage to my bank account because I could drink about 10 glasses of their Moscato and be unfazed!"}
{"text":"Great spot for day drinking! 
This is my husband and I's favorite heritage district restaurant. We normally go for lunch. Until 5, wine and pitchers of beer are $5. They are very friendly. And the food is pretty good. My husband and I normally share a butchers block. Other times, he gets the nine iron and I get bruschetta. Even though it is a wine bar, it is still kid friendly. We bring our children and they easily are happy with their meal. This is not a fast paced setting."}
{"text":"Excellent date night spot and as of this writing you can't beat the Monday night 20$ bottle of wine and 4 brochettes of your choosing. Amazing ambiance at night and the location is in the middle of downtown Gilbert should you feel like walking over to the theaters and what not."}
{"text":"We celebrated our friends birthday and they were awesome.  Adam was an awesome server."}
{"text":"Love this place. My family and I come here when ever we can. My two boys just love the butchers block, and the cheese plank. Their happy hour deal is awesome too $5 pitchers. The outside patio is also fun to hang out and relax."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or Happy Hour, although a bit pricey. Bruschettas are good & love their salads.  But the best is the salted caramel sundae! Yum!"}
{"text":"Postino has great atmosphere and the servers are attentive. I tried the salad here and everything was fresh! I really enjoyed their portion and the dressing."}
{"text":"Excellent bruschetta, with many options , including gluten free, depending on preference. In order to construction a platter you choose of a list of options. I ordered and loved 1) Brie, Granny Smith apples, and fig jam 2) kippered salmon, capers, onions, cream cheese 3) caprese 4)pepper jam and goat cheese. I was seated en plein air. My lack of a Star specifically addresses the fact I was literally seated between cushions which was awkward and uncomfortable. I mean I caught the eye of the hostess who sat me there and the waiter noticed as well because I looked contorted...seems like a glaring thing to overlook when you place a table adjacent to a good half foot split of cushion. I can't be the first, there's definitely others with the same harrowing tale to tell. There are probably literally dozens of us."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and they have amazing food! Get the bruschetta it's delicious and you can't go wrong. The cucumber lemonade is also very tasty and refreshing on a hot day. Service is great, they really go above and beyond to make you feel at home- thanks Jenny! :)"}
{"text":"I don't have much new to say, because others have done such a good job describing and taking pictures of the beautiful food and beverage, except this is my new favorite place to day drink.  $5 glasses of wine 11-5?  An interesting and varied wine selection?  I'm there.  

Mr. M and I visited last Monday and the weather was beautiful and perfect for enjoying the open air atmosphere at Postino East.  We were taken care of by two friendly servers who I could see helped each other out all over the restaurant.  

We shared some bruschetta, a sandwich, and a bottle of riesling.  It could not have been a more perfect visit.  The only thing of note is that just south of this block, Gilbert Road is torn up and blocked off and really annoying.  I hope they are doing something good with that mess.  You have to come at Postino from the north (Guadalupe/Gilbert intersection).  I tried to weave around thru residential areas and that doesn't work.  

I can't wait to go back and this will definitely be a place we'll take out of town guests.  Thank you thank you thank you.

*We drove by on 2/11/13 and the construction was cleared out!"}
{"text":"I finally was able to try Postino's last night and I was happy with my experience. We had to wait 45 minutes, but they were very attentive in bringing us drinks as we sat outside. My friend and I ordered a bruschetta board each and shared. I especially loved the prosciutto and fig, warm artichoke, ricotta with pistachios, brie and apple, and the tomato jam with goat cheese. While they were all flavorful and delicious, I was disappointed that some of the bread wasn't toasted enough, so they ended up being soggy instead of crisp. But, overall I enjoyed my food and will be back!"}
{"text":"If you want a nice friendly place to have a meal and of course a cocktail.....this is the one.
Warm and friendly makes you want to go back too.  The food is awesome"}
{"text":"Girlfriends & I shared a bruschetta appetizer. AMAZING!! Food and service were both most excellent.   our server helped us choose a bottle of wine and was very helpful with every decision we needed to make. 
Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a large group one week in advance. Two days before they called and said they were \"overbooked\" and could not seat our party. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere! Great service! Awesome food! Friendly guests! Beautiful day!  What more can you ask for!!!  We had the bruschetta board and the chicken salad and tuna panini. Everything was wonderful we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love Postinos! My husband and I go here a lot just to relax with good food and wine. The atmosphere is fun and exciting as well. A must go!"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. One of the more relaxing places to grab a drink in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Always the Pinot Noir, Always the 9 Iron Sandwich.  However, I only go when the wine is $5 per glass, because I am such a value person.  

Unless it is Monday or Tuesday, then I go with the $20 bottle and Bruscetta board.  Another exceptional value."}
{"text":"Great place really Loke you can you use no wait app. Also dog friendly  are is a plus"}
{"text":"We went to Postinos and had the best food. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"Nice place... menu limited but what we had was yummy..Great service.. Great area..clean great tea"}
{"text":"Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooove Postino. I'm sure all East Valley peeps cheered with joy just like I did when I realized I wouldn't have to drive all the way to Arcadia or the downtown locations anymore! This Gilbert location has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating but my favorite spot to hang out in the restaurant is the couch. My friends and I will come here during our lunch break and have a lovely time here. Check out how many people that couch can hold:

Service is awesome, I even saw my dog trainer Jess servin' it up so I know they have a good crew there. 
Food is AMAZING-if you're into salads at all you HAVE to try the
----------------------------Raspberry Chicken 9.75------------------------------------
Organic chicken salad with pecans, apples, gorgonzola and mayo with raspberry vinaigrette over a bed of fresh greens

 -it's irresistible, just like the location. ;)"}
{"text":"First off, I have always enjoyed Postino, and have experienced nothing but great service at both locations I have frequented until now. 

My fiancee and I enjoy Postino's so much we wanted to host our rehearsal dinner there, so we could introduce friends, and family from out of the state, to the establishment we enjoyed so much. 

This is where the problem began - 

My Fiancee has been in to the location and has requested information on doing this - She has never been contacted back

I have been to the location requesting information on doing this and hoping to set it up by booking it in advance to make sure there is not a hiccup - No response

I have called and left multiple messages - I have never been called back 

We have both emailed through the website - No Response

We figured that trying to get this arranged four months before the date we needed would be enough, as to avoid any issues, but of course the establishment would have to:

A. Have a staff that is capable of responding to a simple request for information

&

B. Have a staff that cared about those who frequent their establishment enough to respond in any way with some sort of answer, even if it was a simple \"we don't give a SH!T enough to bother with this\" and have a great day. 

Losing our business won't mean much in the scheme of things, but perhaps this review, and the word of mouth may present enough of a catalyst to at the very least respond to request, whether they are in person, writing, or by phone.

Make it a great day"}
{"text":"The food is great, the wine choice is very good and I love the special that they have on Tuesday night.  Wonderful!  I'll go back again and again and take all my family and friends!"}
{"text":"Great, great, great. Fabulous location [in my work 'hood], wonderful building, capable and friendly staff and the usual ahmazing food. 

Was so glad to know that this very fine sibling is close to work and just as good as the Arcadia location. I went for lunch and was not disappointed. A wait for tables but we saddled up to the bar and were served there. A busy hum to the place but service was tight and the bar tender attentive. For the record, I had the Mozzarella Chicken on ciabatta. Delish. More bread than I usually eat but totally worth the carbs. 

I could continue the rant but like so many others, I was blown away in the best possible way. And will return."}
{"text":"My husband and I thought we would try something new for our 40th anniversary breakfast (brunch). As long as the restaurant has something close to a traditional breakfast I can get him to try new restaurants. We frequent the Hale theater but always eat at Liberty Market so today we ventured across the street to Postinos. He had the ciabatta French toast and I had the Morning Staple (eggs, bacon, walnut toast and roasted potatoes). The French toast was excellent but the Morning Staple could have used more than 3 small cubed potatoes. Not that I wanted to eat a lot of carbs this morning, but really,  if you're going to list roasted potatoes as part of the meal, at least put a 1/2 cup worth. It seemed the presentation was more important. I should have taken a picture of my plate. I found the 3 cubes under my bacon. I will say the walnut toast was very good as well as their fresh berry jelly. 
Our next adventure here is to try the bruschetta. We saw several plates go by and it looked absolutely delicious. Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is great. We will be back but not for breakfast."}
{"text":"Really liked this place a lot! Now that my wife and I have a dog, we've been in search of dog-friendly patios. This location has a great outdoor area for dogs. Dining guests also hang out there and it's so wide open, you don't feel on top of each other. Wife and I ordered some white wine, a variety of bruschetta and split a raspberry chicken salad. All of it was excellent. The bruschettas were all very inventive - I think our favorite was the one with pistachios and dates. Who knew?! The salad had a perfect combo of palate goodness. It came to an acidic high note with the vinaigrette but the raspberry dressing on the side was both sweet and savory to offset that. Our dog loved the people watching, the interaction with little kids throwing the bocce balls for him, and the freedom to roam around. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This location was a little bit hard for me to find, as I didn't have the GPS on at the time. I was so glad that I could finally find the place. There was long wait line, but the hosts were attentive enough to come by and check every 5mins with drink offers. During the wait time, I tried a glass of Bianca Vigna, and I surely couldn't get enough of it. 

We ordered Mozzarella and Tomatoes to start with, following by the Bruschetta. There were a lot of options in the menu, but we chose: 

1. Brie & Apples with Fig Spread
2. Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios
3. Smoked Salmon with Pesto
4. Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato

I would say the Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato was my favorite of all 4. I have never tried Postino on the West side, but so far I have had such a good experience dining here. 

Decoration is pretty nice, and there were only 2 co-ed bathrooms. Parking may be hard to find sometimes, but it doesn't stop me from coming back another time."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by some new friends. As a newbie I went with the bruschetta boards with gluten free bread and they were really good. My favorite was the salmon with pesto. The waitstaff was attentive and I enjoyed the kind of elegant hipster vibe. When my friends come to visit we'll make a point to have dinner there."}
{"text":"Gilbert, if you like a wine list of literally ten wines, a menu consisting of bread and bread byproducts, 40 year old Gilbert moms trying to look cool, and whiffing the smell of a far greater restaurant next door i.e. Liberty Market or Joe's, then Postino East is the way to go.

I heard of Postino while reading another great issue of Phoenix Magazine while getting my hair trimmed at Great Clips. Hmm I said. This restaurant sounds intriguing.

Making my way to the Gotham City of the desert, Gilbert, i maneuvered my Mini Cooper through the thriving metropolis, and parked in one of Postino's well graveled parking spots.

It was then I entered Gilbert's version of a wine cafe. When I drink wine at a wine bar I expect it to taste like the nectar of the gods, unfortunately at Postino's this isn't the case. Their wine list is less insignificant then Tim Meadows's career. With so little to choose from I ended up ordering a wine I've never tasted before; a risky proposition to be sure. My wine ended up tasting like the liquid equivalent of Journey without Steve Perry.

After emptying the reminder of my wine in one of Postino's urinals, I decided to eat some food. I ordered the bruschetta sampler in which i get to pick out four different kinds of flour based goodness. The pesto salami was definitely my favorite; sort of like Michael Winslow being my favorite in the Police Academy films.

The atmosphere is interesting the say the least; if you enjoy looking at women with sun spots and 8 year old twins and the creepy men checking them out from across the room then this is your spot.

I'll pass and stick with Joe's across the street."}
{"text":"I'm in L-O-V-E with this place...no joke, such a great spot to spend the evening. Great staff, beautiful decor, excellent food and adult Jenga. What more can a person ask for, when wanting to spend a fun evening out with friends. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went here on a Wednesday afternoon for a quick lunch and glass of wine and were very happy with the experience. 

We shared a bruschetta board which was very good. I was a big fan of the bread as I miss our bakeries back east. The wine selection is good enough without being overwhelming. The selections aren't the every day generic choices you get in a lot of places also. 

Only downside is we sat outside in the sun and it was a bit warmer than we anticipated, but this was our own fault. The hostess asked if we wanted another seat as it might be a bit sunny. 

I can see how if this were a Friday night how the place could be overwhelmingly crowded and noisy as others have pointed out. So I would shy away from hitting the place up at peak times. It was fairly crowded for an early Wednesday afternoon.

So why 4 of 5? I will and want to go back, but can wait on it. I thought the menu was a bit limited, so not much else was screaming to me \"Come back ASAP!\". The appetizers I remember being on the pricey side as well."}
{"text":"Happy to say Postino Gilbert has the same quality of food as the Arcadia and Central locations. The HH deals are the same, the wines are the same and the bruschetta taste just as tasty over here too.  The benefit of Gilbert's location is their super large patio seating (which seems to get bigger and bigger every time) with the comfy chimney outside.

The only value-added comment I can contribute to such an extensively reviewed location, is my suggestion to always try the seasonal bruschettas. They are not on the menu nor are mentioned in any way (in written form), but they always have one and they are always part of HH or whatever deal the other bruschettas are currently on. The one I had most recently had pickled beats and arugula with lime juice- super refreshing and delicious. Good to know that at a place where everyone is so happy and comfortable with the things they rely on (Monday/Tuesday night deals, HH, and the taste of their static menu) that at least there is one tiny component that can surprise you. And what is life, really, without tiny little surprises?"}
{"text":"Jason gave great wine recommendations while we sat at the bar! Very genuine and personable with great conversation. We will always come back to see Jason and his smiling face!"}
{"text":"Without question, the best bruschetta, and the most creative bruschetta I have ever had. It's my new favorite dinner with a glass of red.  It should be called \" Italian Sushi\".  It's unbelievable. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always fabulous, 5 dollar pitchers and glasses of wine until 5, and the service is always great. Jason is my favorite server, but honestly the entire staff is stellar."}
{"text":"Great food even though a limited menu.  Be sure to try the red pepper soup."}
{"text":"Postino is my favorite restaurant in Arizona.  Their cucumber honey lemonade and bruschetta is incredible.  It's not the most inexpensive spot, but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Every Monday night a few buddies and I go out for board and bottle, we have been doing this for a few months now, each time we have had a great time. There are multiple members of the staff, not only our server that night, that take the opportunity to ensure we are having a good time. The servers are sociable and our water glasses are always filled. The food is excellent. We have been doing this for many Mondays, and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Good food....horrible service....worse management. I can't grasp the whole \"we don't have servers assinged\" bit. \"We want everyone to feel welcomed so we have everyone waiting on you\" bs! That's the worst way to run a restaraunt. Every time I've been they've forgotten part of our order and/or just ignorred us. Id rather eat at Liberty Market across the street. I've spoken to managment about the bad service and all the gal has done is make excuses. That's not how you run a place. I believe in word of mouth...and the words out of my mouth to everyone I know is not to patron this location."}
{"text":"Great way to spend happy hour! Love doing the two for one deal.... Their soups if the moment changes daily and during the day as it runs out but all the ones I've had have been delightful! Great place to sit outside too! $5 pitcher or $5 wine from 11-5 awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and drinks as is normal for Postino. However, we consistently had to wait to place orders for new drinks when our glasses we're empty and we're not acknowledged when we wanted food. We were given our check without being asked if we wanted it, well before closing hours. Ultimately disappointed, especially knowing what they are capable of."}
{"text":"Postino never disappoints. I'm thrilled with their new downtown Gilbert location but more over their delicious bruschettas and excellent service. I went here for the opening party on St. Patrick's Day and had a fabulous time. The wine selection is, as always, superb."}
{"text":"Love Postinos. The only thing I diidnt like were the small size (very limited seating at peak hours) of the restaurant. Otherwise, the appetizers are excellent, the wine is probably good (I don't drink wine) and the beer is cold and tasty with a good selection.

The seating is very casual and they also have outside seating. the bar is much too small honestly and they would be wise to expand the bar seating area and size because there are many of us who want a place to sit down that are not with our significant other or are single.

~Stew Keene, Local Area Realtor"}
{"text":"Here's the thing you need to know - if you come for sandwiches and salad, they're good and you'll enjoy them but this is not what you come to Postiono's for. 

You come here for amazing bruschetta platters, awesome wine and mimosas for $5 (or a pitcher of beer but I'm not a beer girl) before 5pm during the week. You come for cheese boards and butcher blocks. You come with a friend and enjoy great service outside in the sun. It's not a meal, but a place to gather with your friends and enjoy an afternoon together. This. This is why we love Postino's"}
{"text":"His retail space has been the location for several eating establishments. Postino's  has made a success of this corner in downtown Gilbert. The restaurant is open and airy, with both indoor and outdoor seating. The main attraction is the wine selection.  The food is somewhat upscale but not classy. The panini sandwiches are great and they have a wide selection of appetizers to go with the wine selections. This is a great place to just sit and unwind and meet friends. The prices are not overly expensive, but, are more than you would expect in a typical bar. If you go, the outside area near the Main Street can get loud with the local traffic. Sitting in the inside or on the side street location may be a little quieter.  Check the menu before you go."}
{"text":"Nice chill but upscale atmosphere to drink a glass (or bottle) of wine. Love the outdoor seating! The bruschetta is amazing (every single kind I've tried I've absolutely loved) More often than not the servers are accommodating & educated with wine pairings (a couple of times I've felt rushed -when they weren't busy- & the server didn't know or maybe just didn't care to impart their knowledge about the wine I was inquiring about) Still a great place!"}
{"text":"Omg! I have literally been in here 3 days in a row now. Not only is the bruschetta and daily soup fricken super amazing but if you ever get JASON as a bartender just know you're in great hands. I'm honestly starting to think I come in for him! Great vibes from the General manager JEFF as well! Thanks again so much you guys seriously made me a forever Postinos East regular!!"}
{"text":"Awesome bruschetta. It's a meal unless you choose to split it with a few table. Very good salads. Very good wine selection. I did the half and half: half sandwich and small salad. I highly recommend it for a nice get together with friends, family, or date night."}
{"text":"Great ambiance!   I highly recommend the bruschetta and Nebbiolo!"}
{"text":"We went to this place without checking if they have gluten free selection and to our surprise, they had amazing bruschettas! For someone who has gluten allergy, this was absolute heaven! This place offers cozy atmosphere with great fireplace outside. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and understanding."}
{"text":"Super yummy place!!! The bruschetta is amazing, as well as the butcher board! Great wine selection, laid back but classy atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting the area with some friends and we came to Postino's for the Tuesday night special. The atmosphere, bruchetta and wine was great! The apple and fig bruchetta was our favorite. We will definitely go back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"I decided to check out this place with my wife. As we all know Gilbert is more of a quite place but this place got it all. I ordered Tomato Mozzarella as an app, and Mozzarella Chicken sandwich on Focaccia bread. Impressive presentation with balanced flavors and fresh ingredients. The servers all worked together to insure outstanding service. 
Well done Guys this is a 4G restaurant and way ahead of the game.Hands down, well done place."}
{"text":"Postino's, my family used to come in at least once a week, but now, we will never return to this location that is only miles from our home. Our food is consistently cold, the service is laughable and it really makes me wonder what in the world the management is doing. Today was the last straw, after waiting an hour for cold food, not getting all of the kid's food so he could even eat, we left hungry and vowing not to return. As we watched other angry patrons leave before being served too. Maybe you got too comfortable being among the first restaurants to make downtown Gilbert, I'm not sure, but I think the owners really need to rethink their staffing plan since there are now an abundance of options downtown. So disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. it's busy, but the atmosphere, while more modern, has a similar feel to the Arcadia location. Tonight we had quite slow service to start and the apologetic server comped our first round of drinks even though we weren't angry about it. I really appreciate that level of customer  service...it's a lost art. the food was wonderful and the beer prices were extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"I loved it here! My brother took my fiance and I here while we were in town for a visit. We had a short wait for a table, but it was during prime happy hour/after work time. We were seated outside and while we walked through the restaurant I couldn't help but admire how cozy it all is. 

We ordered a bottle of wine and two orders of bruschetta. Our server was super helpful with choosing a wine, and all night I felt like she was very attentive! The bruschetta boards were out of control good. Since we tried eight different bruschettas, it's hard to pick a favorite as they were all delicious! Ones that stood out to our group were the smoked salmon with pesto, brie and apples with fig, the BLT (bacon, arugula, tomato with burrata), and the ricotta with dates and pistachios. But honestly, you can't go wrong with anything! We had other plans for the night so we didn't get to stick around for too long, but next time we're in town I definitely want to go back!"}
{"text":"This is one of our new favorite places. Awesome happy hour and the best bartenders \"Suzy \" that we've ever had."}
{"text":"Usually we have a really good experience here but this time was awful. It took over an hour and a half to receive our food and we noticed that multiple people who had come in after us were getting theres before us. My boyfriend had to leave before the food even came because he was gonna be late to work even though we got there more that two hours before his shift. It was also not as busy as it could have been. I don't suggest coming here for brunch."}
{"text":"Great food, we had the bottle and bruschetta $20 deal. The Olives appetizer was good. Sandwiches were good. Our service was terrible. Our waiter was inattentive, scatterbrained, and impatient. It literally took 3 people and 53 minutes to figure out how to split a $125 check 5 ways. We had to explain 3 times with letters and a corresponding key for each credit card."}
{"text":"Two thumbs way up for everything Postinos has to offer. This is a great place to go for a relaxing evening. Lovely ambiance, great food, and amazing service. Everyone is willing to help your table with whatever you need. The food is fresh and light. If you are a fan of bruschetta then you will really enjoy the selection here."}
{"text":"Best food and wine around! Perfect place for a chill girls night or happy hour!  Love the wine selection. Plan to come back and try more stuff on the menu...haven't had anything bad!!!"}
{"text":"Love their bruschetta platters! We've tried brie/apples w/fig, warm artichoke, burrata/bacon/arugala/tomato, and smoked salmon w/pesto, all excellent. I'd recommend getting the panninis for the most bang for your buck, but everything is well made and delicious! THey're always very busy though, so be prepared for a wait.

For brunch, I'd get the Postino Mimosa over the White Peach Bellini because it's stronger, but both are tasty. The smoked salmon is quite good, but all of the brunch items are very small servings, so not the best deal unfortunately.

They have some fun outdoor activities while you wait (for a while) which is nice like bocci ball, giant jenga, it's a different experience with well made food, long waits, and smaller portions."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place.  Had a party of six - gave them my number - they sAid they would text me and it would be about 35 minutes. NEVER texted me."}
{"text":"Love the food here.  The bruschetta boards are amazing (try the apple and brie!) as are the butcher boards.  I am also a big fan of the sandwich and salad combinations you can get.  Happy Hour is 11-5 every day.  We have also had weekend brunch there and it was quite good.  The soups are innovative and always good.  Service is always great. Staff knows the menu and after a few visits, make a point of saying hello to us when we walk in.  It is dog friendly so you can bring your dog in the back area where they have a great sitting area.  Love that.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the music.  Sometimes it is so loud (and sometimes a little wild) it is difficult to hold a conversation. One time we were in there and asked if they could turn down the music a little.  The answer I got was that the management was really opposed to turning down the music as \"they try to set a certain mood with the music\" but she did offer to go talk to to someone.  The music did not get turned down.  The lady next to me leaned over said she agreed about the music. It obviously doesn't bother me enough to stay away.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow! Came here on a Sunday for lunch. It was busy but not packed, which was nice. The wait staff was awesome. Friendly and attentive. We ordered the cheese platter and split a panini. It was pretty big! The cheese platter was wonderful - but I love cheese - and the nuts and dried fruit complimented it perfectly. We didn't order any wine, a mistake that, I'm sure, will be remedied on the next visit."}
{"text":"This place is my husband and I's very favorite place. Great atmosphere,food, and wine. Was pretty sad they took away the Red Pepper Gouda soup they had everyday. Please bring it back!!  Our waiter Scott made up for it with his sparkling personality!"}
{"text":"I went only once with a friends for a birthday dinner. It was good, but nothing exceptional. The server was great. 

The atmosphere was a bit loud, but it was Friday, so I had no expectations of it being quiet. The seating was a bit tight in the dining room and this made it difficult for the servers to freely move. Considering the beautiful weather in our valley this time of year, it would probably be a nice place to go sit outside and enjoy a glass of wine and an appetizer.

I ordered the Tuna Nicoise and it was as expected."}
{"text":"This was a solid meh. It's not a place I would choose on purpose, but I would not say no if someone else wanted to go."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and bruschetta! 

Service is always good and I have never had to wait since I am wiling to sit at the bar or patio."}
{"text":"Service is always very good. Postino's is our family go to with out of town guests right from the airport. Charcuterie and cheese boards, Bruschetta, Faro Salad, good selection of beer and wine. Seasonal beers $5 a pitcher. Occasionally I find the music too loud but today how whose would you play Stones, Jimi H, Led Zepplin?"}
{"text":"Always great food!  There Bruchetta is delicious and I love their raspberry chicken salad.  Can't go wrong here with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"I loved Postinos! 

My friend Lauren was here last night and dragged me here today. She was so giddy with excitement and kept chanting \"Postino, Postino, Postino!\" It was kinda annoying actually. I was kind of off put because of the limited menu so I just let her order for me. 

Just say yes to Bruscetta. We had all the Bruscetta options. Apples and brie, artichoke spread, pesto and salmon - each bite was better than the last. 
It's the kind of food that makes you wonder when you can have it again...and would it be weird to order another order of everything I just ate to go? But then again, I didn't want to seem like a fatty...So the problem was: do I want to be seen as a fatty or do I want to have amazing Bruscetta at home? The struggle was real. 

Last note:
I must advise whoever owns this place to PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE invest a bug zapper. The patio is beautiful, the food is beautiful, the experience is kinda off put when we have killer flies attacking us from all angles trying to suck our blood and eat our Bruscetta.

That's all. 

Postino postino postino!"}
{"text":"Amazing is the only way to describe this place! Atmosphere is low key, trendy, & fun and their bruschetta is the best around. 

Go for happy hour, sit on the patio and enjoy a $5 glass or wine or pitcher of beer and a board of bruschetta. Or go on Monday & Tuesday after 8pm get a bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta for only $20. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great costumer service! Our waiter Derek was fantastic! The food was cooked amazing. I had one of the paninis and I was a bit scared the bread was going to be weird but got to my surprise it was the softest bread perfect for my sandwich.  The environment inside the place was smooth and the music was perfect for us to talk to each other without having to yelled one to another across tables. I really had a great time here tonight. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love bread and I love Wine and this place has both in spades. Even my meat and potatoes husband was happy. This place will make me gain a few inches around the waist and I'm going to enjoy every bruschetta filled bite of it."}
{"text":"Happenin place on a Friday night, so lots of people watching opps, plus awesome food and great wines!"}
{"text":"It is too kid friendly!  I was cautious about going here for dinner, because it's a wine bar, and yelp says it's not good for kids in it's little details of the bar.  We're only here for a short time so I'm not ok with using a babysitter because we know nobody, so the kids had to come with on our \"date night\".  So we brought our 2 boys, armed with an iPhone and Nintendo DS and we said a little prayer that they wouldn't kick us out.  Anyways, the details need to be revised, it has a kids menu for Pete's sake, it was totally kid friendly.  And the kids meals for my little rugrats came with cute toys, little gumbie bendable alien toys and these weird little wax sticks so they could build wax creations at the table.  And there's a lawn with outdoor games, think I saw lawn bowling.  There were misters everywhere and plenty of outdoor seating, some couches, and fab 90's music that reminded me of being in college.  They didn't take reservations for small parties, but they took my number when we got there and sent me a text when the table was available, so I could wander around to the antique shop across the street during the wait.  Oh and the food and wine were great too."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Postino's. I'd never been to a wine bar before, but we'll definitely be coming back. Went on a Friday night with another couple and were seated in about 45 mins, which wasn't bad, considering how busy they were. We were able to socialize on the patio with drinks while waiting. Food was great and the service was quick."}
{"text":"$36 dollars later and I threw most of my to go order away. I used to love the food quality of Postino, but I would like to know how this constitutes as a NYC Grilled Cheese? I mean there's bread and butter, it's not grilled, and there's no cheese. what a waste of my money."}
{"text":"Love the service and food here!  Bruchetta is awesome.  Went here with old friends and they loved it as well..the patio has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! A large party called to make a reservation so the manager asked if we wouldn't mind moving one table down which we had no problem doing and they gave us amazing creme br√ªl√©e on the house. The party never even showed up, which we felt bad about as they lost money and had given us dessert. Really appreciate the great service!!"}
{"text":"I will say this is probably the best wine bar I've been to in the valley so far (although there's many more left to visit for me). Great service, great food, great atmosphere and a good bottle selection. Prices aren't outrageous as you may find in other wine bars. I've looked over their brunch menu but have not been able to visit during those ours yet. Seeing the brunch menu, I can't wait to try that too! 

Food: bruschetta was amazing. My favorite is the salmon. 

Wish I could remember more. Will update when I try more!"}
{"text":"Gotta love Postinos, especially this location.  Nestled in the growing nightlife of downtown Gilbert, this place really gives people a relaxing place to enjoy especially when the weather is nice out.  Upscale, but not overly pricey.  

If you're a wino this place has a great selection of wines at a pretty reasonable price.  Their $20 bottle and bruschetta deal is killer."}
{"text":"I just came home from postino and had a bad case of diarrhea, not only did I find hair in my appetizer The Bounty, I had to come home and suffer.  I AM NEVER GOING TO EAT AT POSTINO again."}
{"text":"Good Happy Hour. Great place to celebrate or reunion with friends, the bruschetta is so good!"}
{"text":"We came in for date night last Friday night and sat at the bar. We were greeted quickly by the bartender who was eager to tell us about their Sauv Blanc options by the bottle. He was knowledgeable and super friendly. 

We ordered a bottle and shared bruchetta. We both ordered the classic with tomatoes, mozzerella and basil. My date ordered one with salmon, i don't know what it was but he loved it and I ordered the warm artichoke. Mine was fantastic, it tasted better than I had expected from the description. 

The whole time we sat there our wine glass was never empty (until the bottle was gone), rather it was the bartender who waited on us or a passer by in the bar area, someone was always topping it off. 

We will defintely be back again...hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. I feel like I'm some fancy rich person drinking wine and cheese, but if I feel like it I can still order a pitcher of beer.  For some reason all of the waiters are men with tattoos and hipster beards and haircuts.  The service is good, but our waiter seemed a bit pretentious. The food is delicious, but don't come here expecting to eat a steak or cheeseburger. The fair is lighter and more sophisticated, except they play Notorious B.I.G. in the background. On Monday and Tuesday nights you can get a bottle of wine and an order of bruschetta for $20, not a bad deal. It's a great place to come with your girlfriends or on a date, I really wouldn't bring the kids here."}
{"text":"I like their wine and food. That's why I give it 2 stars.  If you go there be prepared to wait for 1.5-2 hours on a weekend.  I went on a Tuesday night once and waited for an hour after they told me the wait would be about 35-45 minutes. Their website says they take reservations of 8 or more but when we called they said it had to be 10 or more and didn't seem to care what their website said. (This must have literally just changed because we were there with a group of 8 last week and had no problems getting a reservation)  I certainly don't mind waiting but with a large group I'd rather not.  I agree with another reviewer... They are getting the \"we're so awesome we don't need customer service\"  attitude and that has definitely turned this girl OFF!!!"}
{"text":"Love the fact they do offer a glutton free options. Normally I get the prosciutto and Brie sandwich."}
{"text":"This is the beginning of our Sunday Funday bike rides. Great beer selection, great out door patio. i love the small pitchers of Four Peaks Hop Knot.......nothing like a cool beer buzz to get the Sunday started!!"}
{"text":"I love Postino but service today was really bad. Waited about 25 mins to order a Bellini,  then another 30 mins to order food, they brought wrong order....at the end the comped the order. thank you!
Delicious food, amazing chocolate bouchon...and good music. Next time I will come for brunch."}
{"text":"I loved it here I loved the ambience of this place. They have a good selection of wine and beer options and they have delicious bruschetta that were fresh and appetizing! I recommend this place to anyone that like to drink wine."}
{"text":"Update: they went off the no wait app - that was a nice feature, given how long the waits can be. So now it's not only super loud, but also a long wait pretty much all the time.  I guess the noise is to drive out customers faster so they can rotate more?


Great wines, best bruschetta anywhere, and God prices.  Good service as well.  Minus 1.5 stars for being WAY too loud, especially for a wine place."}
{"text":"What an awesome place for great food and a fun atmosphere. 

We had a party of 16, took up the four couches up front, but the staff was great, very accommodating and prompt with food and drinks. 

Loved the music, as it felt like they were playing straight from my Pandora stations (Foo Fighters, The Black Keys, Cake, Beck). 

Had the nine iron panini and hefeweisen. Great deal on the mini pitchers. $7.5, which got you a little more than two beers. 

We went out of our way to go here and I would recommend anyone else to do the same!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the board and bottle special on Monday & Tuesday nights. For $20 you get a board of their infamous bruschetta and a bottle of wine from an extensive list to choose from. I will occasionally meet up with my girlfriends every other month or so here to catch up on life. 

There are so many types of bruschetta toppings to choose from, but I always, always have to get at least one of the fig ones. I adore figs and they have two varieties of it at Postinos. My second favorite is the one with tomato jam. Yum! I am no wine expert but I do prefer white, sweet wines so I tend to steer towards moscato. Their house moscato is delicious and definitely one of my favorites!

We used to always have to wait every time we come here but on the last couple of occasions, there was no wait. I guess the \"new hype\" factor has died down a bit. But hey, I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait (more than an hour wait for us at 6pm on a Thursday night), but it was well worth it, especially since we got to order wine while we waited. Wine is great, food is great, and service is great...not to mention, it's a mile away from my house. I'm in love! :D"}
{"text":"the brunch is wonderful, the bellini's are a treat and the atmosphere is so fun. love coming to postino east!! i've been many times and i am never disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Urban Chic in downtown Gilbert?  

Got a group of girls to check this place out...heck yah!  The wait that night was like Disneyland, without the VIP pass.  Some of us were too excited to even care about the wait and the others...well, a little annoyed.

I can't believe this was the same place that housed Mahogany Run, Gonzo's and Grain Belt.   The transformation of the building from matronly stuffy to modern simplification of form is a welcoming addition to downtown Gilbert.  It's not so out of place with the hip Liberty Market across the way.  

The fireside patio is full of comfortable contemporary furniture.  It was \"nipply\" outside, hubby likes to say, so we opted to sit inside the warm coziness.  My friends and I were so giddy, we forgot the name of our wonderful server!  We all shared the bruschettas:  prosciutto with fig and mascarpone, smoked salmon and pesto, burrata/bacon/arugula and tomatoes, roasted peppers and goat cheese.  I always suffer the next day from the hidden sodium and gluten overload...but it was all good!  I always have a glass of wine which neutralizes a lot of the symptoms...no, not really.

Gotta leave room for dessert, right?  Creme. Bru. Le.  The classic vanilla with Italian wedding cookie one and coffee, the swan song to every delightful nosh.  

We enjoyed the food and ambiance so much, we're already planning to come back soon!  It's so close, I could ride my bike...nah.  Better book a taxi for the wine bottle/bruschetta specials.

Postino, you deserve all 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I love the bruschetta and wine deal on mondays! Gets busy so get there early or make a reservation."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time. Chose a half panini/half salad combo. The food was delicious! I had a vegetable panini on ciabatta bread and their mixed green salad. My lunch date had the chicken and mozzarella panini and loved it. We saw a lot of mixed bruschetta boards coming out which I will definitely go back and try. I only gave 4 stars bc the music was really loud and our server kind of forgot about us. I don't know if that's the norm but it wouldn't prevent me from going again"}
{"text":"Always have a great time, and a perfect hang out spot. It's a perfect place for trying new wine. The food is pretty much salads, sandwiches, meat/cheese block, and bruschetta for dinner, and a very limited brunch menu. It's good, but I wish there was more variety. They also don't take reservations under 8 people. Their happy hour is $5 wine which is a great deal."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. Had a craving for bruschetta  and this came in to my search and I'm so glad we went. Their food is really good, and fresh. We came before 5pm in the afternoon and all wines are 5 dollars. A $12 or $13 glass of wine for five bucks is a very nice perk. They have a great pilsner beer on tap as well. Great location in super up-and-coming Main Street Gilbert with lots of restaurants around. Very Lively atmosphere, super nice staff that works there. A must go to if you're in this part of town."}
{"text":"Great spot in old town!! The food and wine are top notch!!  We enjoyed the outdoor seating, felt like we were in our own backyard, very comfortable!! Staff and service is outstanding!! Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"YUMMMM!! Every time I come here, the staff are great and the food is always consistent and great! I am so happy we have a place like this closer to my home in Gilbert. I love wine bars, and this one by far exceeds my expectations."}
{"text":"$5 for a pitcher of beer? Cannot ever beat that at a restaurant. The food selection is small, but the items are very good if you are health-conscious & do not want overly greasy or rich food. This is definitely one of my favorite weekend spots."}
{"text":"This is my favorite wine bar for 2 reasons: you get to try wines that you can't find at any other restaurant in the state...and...the location in downtown Gilbert is awesome! I take friends, family and business associates here and I have never once received a complaint about going to a more \"happening\" part of town...I've closed down Postino Gilbert more than once. Service is always great too"}
{"text":"We recently had my sister and her finances wedding shower at Postinos and it could not have gone any better! There was a bit of confusion at the beginning of the evening but it was quickly taken care of. All of the staff was extremely attentive and helpful. As expected, the bruschetta and Panini's were superb and they had a ton of wine and beer choices for the guests. The only drawback was a live acoustic band playing the whole time that we were not made aware of until the day before our event. It was rather hard to hear everyone as we played shower games but at least they weren't terrible sounding. I would definitely recommend for anyone to hold a special event there!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Great outdoor seating area, fantastic service, very chill ambience, live music... So many great things to say about it! 

We tried the bruschetta platter & each kind was fabulous! Then we got a few different paninis & those were to die for as well... They call themselves a wine bar, but also have a great selection of beers & you can't beat the prices! 

If I lived nearby, I'd for sure be a regular!"}
{"text":"Such great food and atmosphere! I would like to see more vegan options. :] I usually get the veggie sandwhich without artichoke spread, since it has dairy, and the side salad without cheese. Tasty and filling! I love the bruschetta, obviously, but again I would like to see more veggie options. You can have them make substitutions, but I would love to see them get creative with it. :]"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE Arizona restaurant - hands down.  My fave is the weekend brunch - haven't had a bad dish yet.  Bellini and smoked salmon with capers - perfect way to start a Sunday!  The servers are so great - every one of them makes the experience what it is.  The only less than perfect experience happened int he dining room during Sunday brunch - sat us in the worst two top in the place.  But we made the best of it.  So happy this locale is so close to home.  Keep it up Postino's!!!!"}
{"text":"I love all the Postino locations, but Postino East may be my favorite. Conveniently located in Downtown Gilbert, this Postino never disappoints with delicious bruschetta, amazing sandwiches, and great happy hour deals. Not to mention the staff and service is phenomenal. Postino is a must-go for locals and out of towners alike."}
{"text":"Happy hour and bruschetta what more can You ask for?! I always come here whenever I visit arizona. They have happy hour for 20 that comes with a bottle of wine and a plate of bruschetta. My favorite is the salmon and apples. If you're looking for a good place with food and drinks this is the place to come on a nice summer day. $5 wine glasses till 5pm!"}
{"text":"I usually would rate Postino East with 5 stars.  We love their food and the fun , cool atmosphere, however last night our service was terrible.  Our server came to our table and hastily took our drink and food order, as we were only ordering appetizers.   She brought our drinks back a few minutes later and then we didn't see her for about 35 minutes.  I finally flagged her down and asked for another glass of wine.  She finally came back about 10 minutes later....With our check. No wine, no question about dessert, no \"take your time\".  We wanted coffee, another drink and dessert, but were so off - put by her lack of service that we left to get a drink elsewhere.   We've had good experiences here in the past, so we will likely go back, but if this had been our first time, it also would have been our last."}
{"text":"I had no wait at lunch today and the servers and bus-people were always right on top of things. I had a half panini (prosciutto with brie) and a half chicken raspberry salad. These are 2 of the best things I have eaten in a really long time. We had to order the chocolate cake for dessert just because we didn't want to leave! Decent prices, great service and fantastic food! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax and enjoy a great glass of wine and delicious food. We went during happy hour on a Saturday, busy, but not a long wait. We ordered wine and beer and a cheese platters. Cheese was so good. It was enough to share with 4 of us. Service was great.  I will returning soon."}
{"text":"Went there for Mother Day dinner with my kids!!! Not busy not slow had to wait a little for hostess to seat other tables . Also plan on being here for but the food takes a bit to come out. That was the only complaint and not even really a complaint more just a statement and opinion. The food was good I feel it's a little pricey for what your getting but still come so."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because as much as I really love coming here, I have to say the bruschetta has really been lacking lately.  The bread has been hard (like stale hard) and the bruschetta toppings have been skimpy. It's been 2 or 3 times now so I had to review again. Hoping they'll read this and make improvements."}
{"text":"This newest location is absolutely beautiful and fits in perfect with their urban style building.  Looks like they reworked another old brick building and made it amazing. Open and airy yet warm and inviting.

The Select Two for $10 lunch is so reasonable and tasty! The wide selection of panini & salads is perfect for the picky eater.  My guest got a bowl of soup that was delicious as well.

Thanks Postino's!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Very nice place to relax, enjoy food, drinks and family & friends!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy this is in Gilbert!  I've only been once, but I want to be here every day!  The decor is upscale casual, very pleasing to the eye, swanky, and the place is family friendly.  Plus, they play great music.

11am - 5pm everyday wine by the glass or a pitcher of beer is $5.  

Mondays and Tuesdays after 8pm $20 for any house bottle of wine and bruschetta.

This is a wine bar, but the food is what draws me in.  There's an OK selection of wines and beers, but go for the food and atmosphere.

Favorites:
- Bruschetta (choose 4 from 11).  I liked the Smoked salmon with pesto and Tomato jam & fresh sheeps milk cheese.
- Olives (expensive, but soooo good)
- Chicken & Mozzarella Panini"}
{"text":"Love postinos! The Monday and Tuesday wine and bruschetta special is awesome! The food is delicious and I love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a very nice meal here. We started with the bruschetta board, which was delicious as everyone else has said. I got a glass of wine which was very good. We both had sandwiches and soup as well. All was superb. I loved the atmosphere out on the patio. Service was amazing. We ended with a chocolate dessert with a side of salted caramel sauce that the waitress suggested... AMAZING! Next time I'll just order a glass of the caramel sauce to drink, it's seriously THAT good. Don't miss out on the caramel sauce!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Such a fun date night place. There is a playful and even romantic feeling in sharing  a savory Board of bruschetta with your date while sipping a glass of wine. Sitting on the patio is my favorite. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We decided to do a girls day at Postino's and we started out with a server who was very knowledgeable about his wine but seemed rushed. He was at the end of his shift and we were lucky enough to get Jason who was very friendly from the beginning and he was even kind enough to save us from a bee! He was very thorough with helping us choose the right wine when others would probably would have given up. We thank you so much for the extended amazing service we really appreciate it! We aren't always blessed with such great service so we are truly grateful for your service and we will only request you from now on! We will be back"}
{"text":"Love love love Postino!!!! This location is great, good places to eat inside and outside. He bruschetta board is incredible. My favorites are the salami and pesto and hummus and tomatoes. Service was great and they were accommodating to out 14 person party."}
{"text":"It is weird seeing this location here, given my years spent in Gilbert. Never thought that they would ever build up the area, after so many years of promise. If I had had the capital that the owners have, I'd have done the exact same thing they are doing, because this is the perfect location for a trendy hipster joint like Postinos.

Everyone knows Postinos from their other locations, I have reviewed the others, so lets cut to the chase: Great location, you can walk around to Joyride or Zinburger (both Fox Concepts) and enjoy their different flair if its not a $20 bruschetta night and you just came in for wine. The area is continuously getting built up further and its going to turn into a powerhouse. Once again, really wish I had the capital to get rights to work with these guys, they are an amazing company and they have hit the ball out of the park on literally every location they have placed down. Also, the staff here are great. Our waiter offerred to exchange one of the listed pour bottles for a vintage that was not selling well due to price ($70 for a bottle of vino!?!), at $12 a glass. 

The only issue I have which loses a star is their usage of space outside. They have a \"waiting area\" it seems that is made up of 6 or so very small high-top tables where you can place your wine glass. They could easily go the Culinary Dropout route and use the space for more cornhole area (which they do have in a trunk mind you), or other games. Otherwise, take out the putting green-like carpeting , put more tables out there and you will have even more space for us Spring-loving weather seekers to enjoy the outdoors. 

Otherwise, this place is a homerun as always, consistent as you'd expect with Postinos. 
4 stars for consistency, location, wine quality and offerings, and great staff. Amazing first or second date spot, and is usually #1 in my rotation for just that. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"My nephew and I stopped in here for lunch. The Gouda red pepper soup was delicious as was the chicken salad. The roast beef panini could have been a bit more rare, kind of dry. The service by Dalton was very good!"}
{"text":"We love to order a board and a bottle of wine for a romantic evening."}
{"text":"Low stars based on service and food (wine selection and ambiance are not bad) 

If you want to go here on date, this is a great spot- it's romantic with the dark lighting and intimate seating. 

If you want to take a group, maybe try another place- It seems very difficult for them to bring out food for large groups in a timely manner. Also, splitting the check must be rocket science because on various occasions they were not able to."}
{"text":"Awesome place to sit, relax and enjoy a glass of wine. The Bottle and Board special on Tuesday night is GREAT...."}
{"text":"There's nothing not to like here except the wait on wine & bruschetta nights. The food is wonderfully prepared and very fresh. Can't complain about the wine list or beer selection. It's great to be able to have a drink on their \"front porch\" while waiting for a table."}
{"text":"I am giving Postino only 3 stars not because of any things I do not like, but because of what I feel it is lacking.  Let me start by saying that Postino East is nicely decorated and comfortable.  The wine selection is nice.  I do wish, however, that there were spirit options.  Now I understand that this is a wine bar but sometimes you want a cocktail.  The food is a tad bit frou-frou for my particular taste buds.  I'd like to see some other options as well.  The other reason is that this is not my favorite is going through downtown Gilbert can be a real hassle between the lack of parking, construction and police and speed zones.  Postino has an air about it....the staff can be a tad bit up-itty.  I will give Postino another and will amend my review if I feel differently."}
{"text":"Postino
Always good food and service....can't beat the Bruschetta.  If you have not been here before you are missing some of the best food the valley has to offer.  I was at the original Resturant many years ago on opening day and have been coming back ever since.  Thanks Craig!"}
{"text":"The bruschetta is amazing! They also have an awesome summertime wine that's super delicious and only $5 a glass for happy hour!

The only negative thing, it's typically packed, which leaves you to sit outside. Not so bad since they have misters... but the misters were dripping onto our table. Assuming you can shift around or find a shaded or inside seat, you can't wrong! :)"}
{"text":"Cannot find anything to complain about. Great food, good service and good wine list. Can get busy, but they have always found a seat for us and if we had to wait outside they brought wine!"}
{"text":"This place is great. We have small children and they are always accommodating. Their kids menu is great. Healthy choices and my son loves it.  I wasn't a big bruschetta guy before trying this place. I love the variety.  It's a must try."}
{"text":"This place is great.The butchers block and bruschetta are my favorites. You can mix and match the bruschetta so everyone can get what they want. I would suggest the BLT, smoked salmon, and fig with goat cheese. This place also has a great atmosphere so it would be perfect for a date night."}
{"text":"Stopped around 1 for a glass of wine & bruschetta with the boyfriend.  I've heard so much about Postino & it definitely lived up to the hype.  Luckily, we were able to just walk in without the crazy wait & choose a comfy pair of chairs with a great view of the patio.

The waitstaff is amazing.  They seem to really enjoy being there & it shows in the service.  I enjoyed a $5 glass of wine & the boyfriend chose a $5 pitcher of beer... the bruschetta ended up being a little pricey but it went above and beyond what I expected from bruschetta.  Delicious.  

It was worth the drive to downtown Gilbert.  All in all, a very cute date spot.  I love the lawn in the back!  The overall style is so modern without being stuffy-- it's definitely a place you'll want to stay.  I wish more places were like Postino."}
{"text":"So the way I do my ratings is that I assign 1 star to each of the following 5 categories:  Location, Service, Food, Atmosphere, Value. 

This place definitely has all 5! It is located in a quaint little historic are of Gilbert alongside some cool old buildings with old neon signage. 

The service was very good with incredibly friendly people who seem to care about your experience (and trust me, this is becoming rare). Even though the waiter forgot one of our orders, we were enjoying our first course so much that it didn't even matter and he corrected it right away. 

The food is amazing! It's kind of a unique menu, most of it dedicated to charcuterie and bruschetta. But the varieties are creative and VERY tasty! you can choose any combination of 4 bruschettas served on a wood board. Each bruschetta is served on a nicely grilled bread slice that is cut in 4 for easy sharing (the goat cheese and roasted pepper was soooo good!). We also ordered the Butcher's Block which is an assortment of meats, olives, cheese, hummus and crostinis. Every bite was delicious. Oh yeah, and from 11am-5pm EVERY DAY they have a $5 happy hour drink special. We had peach bellinis which were excellent.

The atmosphere is also very cool, nice wood tables with a huge wine rack on one wall, very lively and they even have an outdoor patio with a bocci ball court you can play on. The music was loud enough to hear, but not too loud and any place that plays The Smiths while you eat has to be COOL!

Finally, the price was surprisingly reasonable. The cost to value ratio is very good. My wife and I got out of there for under $45 and more than satisfied with our meal.

They have 3 locations, but if you are anywhere near Gilbert, make it a point to stop on by for a board of tastiness!"}
{"text":"If you're ever in the area please please please try this place out! You will not regret it. I came here for dinner once while I was visiting a friend who was in Gilbert for med school. I'm so sad that it's so far away from home because I constantly crave the meal we had here!! Everything is good so it's no wonder there's always a long wait. But the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"I like the place and at least we have one in the east valley.  However, it's marginal compared to the Arcadia location.  The obvious reason is the overall vibe and the crowd.  I live in Gilbert but it would be nice to go to a bar or lounge and it actually feel like a bar or lounge.  Not people bringing kids or going there to order an ice tea and salad.  Yes I know, it's you're right to go order your salad and non-alcoholic beverage anywhere you choose.  It's always busy and the service is relatively consistent.  The magic has always been the concept and $5 happy hour.  Brilliant!  We've been here at least 5 times and have been to the Arcadia and Central locations a number of times.  Truly, of all their restaurants/bars they own I would say that Windsor is the best place.  We will continue to go here once in a while."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Postino's!  They have a really awesome and unique set up.  The inside opens up into the outside patio.  It stays really cool outside even when it's 100 degrees outside.  They play fun music at a good volume level.  The greens salad was really really good!  Also a really good selection of bruschetta.  There is a fire place for when it's cold too."}
{"text":"We've been meaning to come here for a while now.  Finally had sufficient motivation to do so!

First impression:  Loud. The music is loud (even outside), and so the guests have to be loud to be heard.  They should probably turn it down a notch or two.  Staff was friendly and helpful upon arrival.

Despite the label here in Yelp, this is not an Italian restaurant.  Even the staff emphasized that, despite the Italian-sounding names of some of the food.  it is a bruschetta and wine bar.  They do have a good number of wines to choose from.  Seems they are trying to be like Vintage 95 was (alas, they closed!). 

Service was friendly and appropriately attentive. Variety of salads and sandwiches (panini). Happy hour from 11-5. Prices are a bit high.

We ordered chicken and mozzarella panini, raspberry chicken salad, bruschetta board, and autostrada sandwich.  The bruschetta board was disappointing.  Again, we couldn't help but compare to Vintage 95 and this wasn't even close.  The chicken panini was pretty good.  Nothing to rave, but pretty good.  The one who ordered the raspberry chicken salad really liked it, and that's probably the only thing saving me from going to two stars.  Everything else was underwhelming.  Not bad, but not good enough to rave about (and pay $18 per person with tip).  If this had been dinner I would have been very upset.  This menu is not appropriate for dinner, in my opinion.

Definitely not a replacement of Vintage 95, and not someplace I plan to frequent.  For the price it just didn't \"wow\" us at all."}
{"text":"Was a nice end to our evening in downtown Gilbert we had dessert shared amongst us. We had their delicious Creme Br√ªl√©e and Chocolate Bouchon with some French press coffee   Great atmosphere great staff and yummy dessert. With the rain pouring outside we had a great view of the storm passing through out the expanse of windows.  First time we went there for dessert. Good choice on our part !"}
{"text":"Scottsdale in Gilbert! Great everything, just need a bigger place and larger bar area to accommodate walk ins that don't require a fancy table."}
{"text":"I have been to Postinos a couple of times and the place is good. However, I ordered takeout today and was disappointed with the food. Their salads are usually delicious though this time it was missing ingredients and smaller. I had the same salad a few weeks ago at the restaurant and there was a lot of substance to it, but this time it only had kale and two slices of apples."}
{"text":"Is a great place to take your significant other out for a nice meal and some wine.  You cannot beat the atmosphere with an open modern building in downtown Gilbert.  When you go there you have to get the Bruschetta.  Their Bruschetta is the best I have ever had.  They have a wide variety of Bruschetta which comes in 4's on a wood cutting block.  They also have panini's which are amazing.  I am a fan of the Prosciutto and Brie.  That sandwich is amazing.  Oh, and get the baked chips cant go wrong.  If you come here be sure its on a high carb day because you will be pounding down some carbs, but it is well worth it!

{"text":"I come here all the time and I never have a bad experience. The wait time is usually long because this place is so busy but tonight my family and I were seated immediately.
I ordered the Pub Board as and appetizer and the bruschetta as an entr√©e. They were both delicious.
The service here is great and I love the atmosphere but my favorite thing here is the music.
I highly recommend going to Postino."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times since they opened.  The wine is terrific, the food delicious but boy was it crowded! I have gone with large groups and the wait is always at least 2 hrs. One time we sat on the grass area and were still served, which was like a picnic, very nice. The second time we all chose to eat somewhere else but came back for drinks after dinner when it was much less crowded.  It would be nice to be able to make reservations so next time we can all stay and get the full experience.  It delights me to see a place in Gilbert as happening as this place is! I will be back to try with a large group again at the end of the month BUT I might just have to treat myself to lunch there before then, it's not possible to go there too often is it?"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and this was/is one place that has been overwhelmingly recommended. My friend and I gave it a try on 7/27 and we loved the ambiance and our servers were lovely and informative. We shared the bruschetta plate and it was to die for! I plan on bringing my hubby next time for Tuesday date night as they have a sweet deal of bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20! I'm so glad to have found this local gem!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was absolutely packed on a Thursday night.  We found our way to the hostess station and was informed the wait was 90 minutes.  Normally this would make me crazy and would never consider waiting that long but fortunately the bar was the perfect place to hang out, drink and socialize while waiting.  At the 35 minute mark we were offered our table.  I guess the idea is to under promise and over deliver.  Every employee we encountered was friendly and made us feel welcome despite what a madhouse the place was.  The remodel is spot on as most of the original building has been transformed.  

On an unrelated note, beware of the speed trap along Gilbert road.  We were seated at a street side patio table and watched a motorcycle cop pulling people over, one after the other.  The speed limit is 25mph and it seems the Gilbert PD takes the speed limit very seriously."}
{"text":"Only reason for four stars instead of five is the NOISE LEVEL. The food is always consistently good and the extensive wine list is superb. I seem to always get the Butcher Block as an appetizer and it fills me up, which is too bad because their paninis and incredible bruschettas are worth driving across town for. All the wait staff are wonderful, helpful, adorable and extremely accommodating."}
{"text":"The Smoked Salmon  brochetta is off the hook. I suggest trying all of them though they are delicious."}
{"text":"Lots of empty tables ... 25-30 minute wait for brunch for two ... Must not be cool enough for this place.  Joyride ...  operated by the same company ... next door rocks.  Can't figure that out."}
{"text":"Seriously, this is the best place in the universe!!! My little sister had a court house wedding on NYE 2015! At the last minute (that's how my family does things) we decided to try and find a spot for a celebratory meal and called Postinos to try and see if we had a chance to  get in last second. We talked to the manager Justice, and he was so accommodating and made the night so amazing and special. Our server, Felix, was awesome and so attentive. We had 5 star service with extra personality. Our server at one point, had the New Year's Eve crown on! The whole atmosphere was amazing and made their special day even better. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Postino East, or Central, or Arcadia, I become convinced Postino is the love of my life!!! It's pretty patios are perfect for Fundays with my girls or nights with a fellow. Great wine (their $5 before 5 will be my undoing for sure), yummy carb-based food (but it's okay, because the portions aren't Texas sized, right?!?! Alas, still yummy, yummy, carbs - carbs make me happy though), fun music, incredibly friendly service..... 

OH! The piece de resistance!!! They are Edie Approved. Which means, this pup becomes the most fervent beggar when the bruschetta lands on the table as she waits and waits for some of the perfectly crispy bacon and crumbs of the crust! It's Pawsivitely perfect for day dates with my mini mutt!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My boyfriend and I shared the bruschetta(you pick four different ones for the plate) and were in heaven. My favorite was the burrata, bacon, arugula and tomato his was the Brie, Apple and fig spread. We also got the roasted red pepper and goat cheese and artichoke spread ones. They were delicious as well. We also shared the butchers block which was really good. I got a cup of broccoli cheddar soup which tasted fine, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Best bruschetta is the whole world. Such amazing ideas and taste. Beautiful location and set up. Weekends add up a long wait but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service.  They take a team approach that leaves no one waiting too long.  The only wait is to get in.  The bruschetta is worth it.  Try one, try three, try them all.  They're all amazing!  If you are a wine lover, you can drink to content and have all the best snacks to go along with it...olives, cheese, bruschetta."}
{"text":"The best food and wine the service is amazing the atmosphere is great the seeding is beautiful I'm so glad this place came to Gilbert my family and I love to go here at least once a month if not more. Very retro great people that work there with great attitudes quick service and good food"}
{"text":"My wife loves this place, she likes to stop by for some feeding when we are in the area. I find the food to be good tasting but maybe a bit small in serving sizes for someone as hearty of an eater as I am. I still give them 4 stars though. 

It's a pretty what you would expect little step up from Olive Garden type of restaurant.

Good spot for dates or dining with friends.

Worth a taste"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here for HH to download from the day. Postino's has great food, wine and atmosphere. We always sit at the bar and are very well taken care of by Patrick and Dan.  We stick to the bruschetta board but have tried the roast beef, turkey and chicken sandwiches and they are pretty tasty as well.  The salads are good also but I prefer a sandwich or board."}
{"text":"This is a great spot and I hear it has an even better happy hour which I am excited to try.  My folks were in town so we made a reservation here for dinner and sat on the patio.  The ambiance was beautiful and to my surprise we didn't notice much road noise.  

The wine selection is immense and is something I'm interested in delving more into.  The menu is a little abbreviated but what we had was delicious.  With that said, I respect a place that has a great small menu instead of a mediocre large one.  Postino is absolutely the former.  We had a bruschetta board and a variety of paninis and everything was incredibly good tasting and fresh.

I will absolutely be back.  Try this place for a quick and upscale bite with easy access to the rest of downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"LOVE...Food was excellent and the wine list was to die for. We met a group of friends to have a glass of wine and we had plans to go to another restaurant. We never left. It was a beautiful night and sitting on the patio was sheer delight !"}
{"text":"Wonderful place I cannot say enough  good about Postinos! Great food love the chicken salad:) Happy hour 11-5  (seven days a week) who doesn't  like that!  Service is always perfect! You will not regret your visit its a must :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Postino's East and I had s good experience. I went on a Tuesday and it was crowded so make sure to get there early 

Once we were finally seated the servers were very attentive and friendly. The food was great and the wine selection was nice."}
{"text":"This place is ugh-mazing. I come here often and love the service, the wine, the people and especially the bruschetta. Not to mention the brunch is incredible too!

Yes, sometimes the wait is a little long, but I promise you, IT'S WORTH THE WAIT. I've been to a couple of other imitation locations and they don't even come close. 

Postinos East is a MUST-GO if you're looking for a girls night out, romantic dinner setting, double date night, sexy brunch time :-) ...whatever the occassion. We've had several small group bday celebrations here. Anything over 8 people is tough for them but they usually make it work. 

The outside grassy area is perfect for a picnic lunch or dinner. You bring the blanket and they bring the service. You can also arrange large parties out there but I think you pay/order all the tables and chairs. Not sure but I've seen it done and it seemes like a quaint space for the large group.

Postinos East delivers phenomenal service and food 100% of the time."}
{"text":"Love this spot.  One of the top 4 to make the Gilbert Historic district a hot spot.  Love the food and the bruschetta platters are a hit to carry out for any party.  Hint to park for downtown Gilbert is behind the water fountains and the large marble, where it says GO, because it's covered parking most people do not know it's public parking. Another spot is behind the main corner...... turn east on the main corner and the lot on the south."}
{"text":"So I came here when I was visiting my little sister at college and it was really good! 20 dollar bottle and board is all you need for two people. The portions are big and it's just such a fun place to be! Can't wait to come back for more! Definitely a must for whenever I come back to Phoenix to visit! Wish they had one in Philly!"}
{"text":"Long wait for two people. Should have looked at the menu before we were sat. Pretty much just soups, salads, and sandwiches.  I really didn't know what this place was about but I don't think I will be back. The food was good, service was mediocre, beer and wine was good too. Almost felt more like an appetizer and drinks happy hour place than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Love everything I've tried there. Servers are always friendly. The atmosphere is great there day and night. Only downfall, i wish there was more room to stand by the bar. With servers and people going to the bathroom, that area gets packed."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. The environment, food, drinks, and customer service is amazing. The Monday night special is amazing."}
{"text":"Superb wine selection. (try the ones on tap - Yum!)  Great deals on good beer during happy hour. ($5 mini pitchers!)
Very friendly staff, comfortable seating, clean restrooms.
Enjoyed most of the bruschetta.  The 'Butcher Board' was amazing.  Try it.
Looking forward to going back.  
Welcome to the neighborhood.  (:"}
{"text":"Another trendy Gilbert restaurant.  The clientele is mostly made up of people eager to be hip,  picking  such a trendy place to dine.  So the vibe is a bit off putting and the music they play makes it hard to speak with your server.  Which is odd and makes the place feel more like a club rather than a relaxed restaurant trying to center itself around wine...kind of an identity crisis going on.  That aside the staff is very friendly and attentive.  Also, the food was good.  I ordered probably one of the best tuna sandwiches I've ever had.  I would go back, but maybe on a week day, not on a weekend night."}
{"text":"i really dig this bar/restaurant, the environment is the best and the bruschetta is off the chain... 








also a lot of hot chicks"}
{"text":"Went here for my best friends birthday brunch. Nice atmosphere. Very limited and small brunch portions. But for 30 dollar you get a whole bottle of champagne for all you can drink mimosas!! So delicious!! I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"One word: Bruschetta. Literally amazing. The environment is extremely comfortable. I could literally spend hours here. Great service, great food. We will be back as often as our checking accounts allow."}
{"text":"Yummy!  I just love this place, its been dubbed my \" first date spot\" comfortable, relaxed and great atmosphere especially for the east valley. I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Fun atmosphere with $5 glass til 5pm everyday! Bruschetta is amazing! Great bartender!"}
{"text":"This is a really cool place, but you definitely go for the wine, and not the food.  I was pregnant the first two times I went (and I don't drink wine anyway, but still), and the food is pretty good, but the selection is so slim.  It is a super fun place to hang out, any time of the year though."}
{"text":"Nice place to relax and have a late Saturday afternoon lunch. We started with the Bruschetta plate, my fav is the prosciutto, figs and mascarpone. Then came the Italian Picnic Salad with chicken. A great experience and a nice ambience."}
{"text":"I love coming to Postinos.  The food is always good and I like the ambiance of the restaurant. We got the hummus & artichoke platter and a plate of the Bruschetta. The only thing I did not like about our visit tonight was that the hostess forgot to put us on the list and all these people who came in after us were getting seated before us. We were sitting right in front of her and she still forgot to put us on the list. when I finally asked why everyone was getting seated before us she said she thought she put us on the list. So that part was irritating and it made us almost walk out. Beside that , the food tasted delicious."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great drinks, and great food. My friend and I shared the brushetta (gluten-free costs an additional $2) and selected 4 different flavors. I absolutely loved the goat cheese and pepper since the two go perfectly together. Pair a bellini with the plate, and voila! BLISS!!!

Glasses of wine are only $5 during happy hour :)"}
{"text":"Amazing wine bar to relax with friends. You must try out their food. Very positive experience every time."}
{"text":"Finally decided to check this place out since it's got such a huge following and always seems to be packed full of people. Usually Liberty is our go to in Downtown Gilbert(we cheated this time). 
The Bestie and I stopped in for a little day drinking on a Friday afternoon. Glad we came shortly before 4 PM because after it got PACKED. I've had the hankering for a sparkling rose lately so I was happy to see one on the cute wine list clip board. Oh might I mention, $5 ANY glass of wine before 5 PM. Um, yes please. Since we both went with the rose, the server recommended we buy the bottle for the happy hour price of $20. Good deal. We also got a bruschetta board which was just incredible. Four good sized selections that are very easy to split(though you may end up fighting over your favorites). I also noticed that they have a large beer selection as well, something that is lacking at most wine bars. This is a huge plus since the husband is more of a beer drinker. I see a Postino date night in our future.

The atmosphere was fun, the groupings of tables and couches made the space crowded but welcoming, and even with open walls in 90 degree heat it was comfortable and airy. The service was just incredible. Our server was attentive and we had other servers checking on us, refilling water glasses, bringing out food, and just making sure we were having a good time. Both of us have worked in the service industry, a little attention goes a long way. They must have an amazing team over there for everyone to work together so well. 
The entire time it was just a shock that there could be somewhere this fun and trendy, on this side of town. I've lived in Gilbert all my life, it's about time downtown gets a little spark back. Plus it's nice to see a new business doing great on this \"cursed\" corner.

We will definitely be back, with friends to help split a bottle. Looking forward to many warm summer nights on the patio at Postino."}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place for months waiting for it to open.  I'm so happy it's finally here.  

It's just as awesome as all the other Postino's.  Bruschetta boards, awesome.  Wine, awesome. Ambiance, awesome.  

Liberty Market and the Farmhouse are both hot spots across the street so parking will be tricky around there.  I'm not looking forward to fighting the crowds - which are inevitable but worth it!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Postinos for some time now and I am so happy I finally did! We had a short wait to get a table so we went to the bar. My sister and both ordered beer which mine came in a can hers in a bottle and they were poured into glasses. Both beers were not very cold and the glasses as well were not chilled or frozen enough. We did bring this to our servers attention later with hopes it would get passed on that maybe there fridge is on its last leg. Other than that everything else was amazing! Now, I have fallen in love with eating bruschettas and cheese and meat boards with that said BOY did theirs not disappoint. There literally was not one thing I tried that was not delicious. We ordered two bruschetta boards that each had four selections of our choice. Each one of them was amazing! I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It's tough to be impartial after all the hype this place got, but alas, I wasn't that impressed.  I think part of the problem with the ambiance is the squawk factor.  It felt like the majority of the patrons there thought they were filming an episode of Sex & The City.  That said, it's only a minor drawback.  

We got the olives, as an appetizer, and they delivered.  The prices on their wine / beer selection were reasonable and also spot on.  The bruschetta is their specialty - and two of the four we chose were really good.  I will say, that quite possibly, the best thing they serve is their BLT bruschetta - way good and something I will crave.  The classic (mozzarella / basil / tomato) needed a little more balsamic & a little less salt.  The brie / apple just needed more brie and it would have been amazing.  The prosciutto / fig one was just forgettable.

We got the roast beef sandwich on ciabatta to share, and here lies the bulk of the trouble.  The bread had good flavor, but it felt like it had fallen in a tub of dust prior to being served (too much excess flour).  The sauce was cloyingly sweet, and their chips were soggy and tasted like they had been cooked ten hours prior.

The service was just fine - and if we had stumbled upon this place, without all the hype / build up, it probably would have deserved a four.  So, IF we go back, it will be for their Monday / Tuesday night special - which is four of their bruschettas + one bottle of wine for $20 - tough to beat."}
{"text":"Good selection of wine. I like $5 special before 5pm for trying new drinks. We like the Gilbert location as it has access to lot of different restaurants."}
{"text":"Breakfast at Postino's is just as good as their dinner. Also means the personal French Press they give you gets put to good use :) 

Great alternative to Liberty Cafe on a weekend which is right across the street and always 10x more crowded during breakfast. Not as much variety on the breakfast menu but their options are tasty and always very well made. 

Only complaint is that the indoor seating area seems very dark - even during morning hours. Sitting outside is always nice but given the summer heat encroaching as early as 9am it's difficult to be completely comfortable outside for a full meal."}
{"text":"First off!  This is breakfast review of this place.  The location and seating is very nice
The menu is ala carte and server in little plates. 
The food was good but under portion and over price keep in mind its ala carte. 
Service /Server was very slow and it was not busy the meal did not come out together and server miss portion of the order

Sample prices
Side of toast $ 2.00 ea Side of potatoes $ 3.00 ea 
Large  OJ $ 4.50 ea  One Egg & Bacon $ 4.50 ea

The total for two $ 27.50 w/o tip.

If Postino East is going to charge these prices for breakfast they should delivery AAA service, but I do not think I will be back. The breakfast across the street is easy 20% lower and just as good."}
{"text":"Wow! The Bruschettas were amazing. So much flavor. And they were good sized too. The tomato jam one was amazing, and the salmon one. We also got a couple paninis which were also great. We had four people and we got 2 orders of the bruschetta and 2 paninis to share and it was plenty. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Postinos on the East side!?

Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to Postinos, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say I can't get enough 
You know I'm gonna have to face it, I'm addicted to Postinos 

Thanks Robert Palmer and let's just say I wouldn't be surprised to see the fashion models around here.  Very attractive crowd!  I am honor just to be here!  

Another bottle of wine and you'll be mine, a one track mind 
I can't be saved 
4 flavors of Bruschetta is all I crave 
If there's some left for you 
and don't mind if I do 

I might as well face it I'm addicted to Postinos

I've always enjoyed attending Postinos on the West side of town, but the East side adds a new flavor.  The place still has a great deal on Monday and Tuesday nights.  Bottle of wine plus a large plate of bruschetta's for $20!  The ambience is always chill and low lighting.  Quite romantic and add some pretty ladies and I'm golden here!  Service is always great at Postinos.  The staff is definitely well train in the knowledge of wine and their service is spectacular! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food is definitely a 5 for me.  I adore their bruschetta and pub board. But the service is a 2 for me.  Man alive this last visit a few days ago was ROUGH.  Hardly any refills, terrible customer service and it took forever to be brought our checks and even longer for our to go boxes. I adore the food so much, so I'll be back but hope for less arrogant service next time!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was the night and the setting and our chaotic week, but my friend and I needed to wind down, and Postino's wasn't the place to do that.  I'm giving the place four stars based on food, but definitely not setting. 

Like all the other restaurants in this area, it was busy. There was a 45 minute wait (but several empty tables inside).  We opted to sit at the bar.  However, before we even ordered drinks we knew we couldn't take the pounding music.  The bartender suggested we try \"the grassy area out back\".   This consisted of a curved, winding concrete seating strip with low tables. The other choice was a tall table that you stood at.  Neither was comfortable.  

I was super hungry and ready for a hefty meal, but Postino's menu only consisted of interesting appetizers, artisan bruschetta, soups/salads, and paninis.  My friend ordered a few different types of bruschetta, which turned out to be a medium sized meal.  I had a very delicious half and half:  Brussels sprouts salad with bacon and dried cherries, and a prosciutto and brie panini.  I spread the generous-sized cloth napkin over my lap and then either held the salad bowl with one hand and ate with the other. Switching off between the two, I balanced the sandwich plate on my knees.  

I will go back to try more of the menu, but at lunchtime.  Not enough on the menu to make me consider it for dinner."}
{"text":"The bruschetta boards are my favorite meal ever!! They also have a delicious moscato not listed on the menu!"}
{"text":"Love the Monday wine and bruschetta special! The bruschetta is by far my favorite menu item at this establishment, I've had them all and they're all very good! I prefer to ask for the bruschetta on toasted thin sliced bread so it doesn't get as soggy of fill me up as fast! Wine selection is good, as is the best selection. I mostly continue to go back here for the bruschetta and atmosphere. You may want to call and make a reservation if going Friday-Sunday, it gets really busy (1.5+ hour waits) and even with the reservation you may end up waiting 30 minutes. They accommodated my birthday gathering of 17 people on their front patio...wish they'd rearranged the sofas for better socialization, but it worked out."}
{"text":"Ok lets make this review fast and easy. In a nut shell 1. Its noisy, 2. it can get really crowded, 3. you can wait a while to get a table. That said, I would come here just for the Bruschetta!!!!!! 8 or 9 different Bruschetta's, we had four different, and wow, it was great!!! Such a nice new punch of flavors right in your mouth!! Me and my wife were almost full so we shared the roast beef paninii and it was GREAT! We will be back, for sure. Woo Hoo!! Would have gave them 5 stars if the music wasn't so loud."}
{"text":"Fun and relaxing place to hang out and have a nice bottle of wine. Their $20 wine and bruschetta board special is the best!"}
{"text":"Just another five star review with everyone else. I typically get great service here. Bruschetta and wine selections are amazing."}
{"text":"Raspberry Chicken Salad and the different bruschetta's are amazing. I absolutely love their food. I have never had a bad experience with their food! 
The only thing I dislike is the wait times are often very long. I would plan on the wait time being 10 minutes longer than what they tell you. 
The service is great once you are seated. I went last week and my card was over charged by 30 dollars. They were great and worked with me and the bank to get it all sorted out.
I would recommend Postinos to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"The environment is open air and relaxing. Service was perfect and food was exactly as described. My first experience was enjoyed by myself and my friends."}
{"text":"We have been here 4 times and it never disappoints.  The bruschetta is the way to go.  Do not expect full meals and ENJOY.  The beer selection is great for a Wine Bar"}
{"text":"I love Postino! Great Bruschetta, wine and awesome patio!!! Staff is always helpful & attentive. Fun, mellow atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Postino's is probably the most amazing restaurant wine bar I've ever eaten in my entire life the ambience itself makes it an absolutely perfect restaurant their food is incredible and their service is also. On Tuesdays they have an amazing special a bottle of wine and a bruschetta for $20 you cannot beat that anywhere. We are from California and we drive to Arizona to visit our friends and we always make it a point to stop by Postinos at least once while we're there their bruschetta is out of this world!!"}
{"text":"Good stuff. Good wine. Great staff. Only wish they had small bites of every meal....except salad cause that's  dumb. Just paninis and snacks. But seriously, always such a nice experience"}
{"text":"Wow this place! Once the wife and I figured this place out we have now gone 3 times in the last 2 weeks. Amazing food and service. Great wine selection, sandwiches and you can beat the special they have going on on Monday and Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Cant say anything bad about this place. I think it was awesome and we didnt go when there were any specials or anything so I would like to try happy hour here but when I went here I was very impressed and would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"My boss invited the whole team here several months ago for happy hour. I have to say this is the best happy hour place I have ever been to. The price for food and wine is friendly. They have diversity choices for the BRUSCHETTA, which can perfectly go with different wines. The only complain I might have is that it is not a place for a single person, cause the size of their dishes are too much to finish."}
{"text":"The house (made) pinot nior \"Stage Dive\" - is spicy and delicious- the atmosphere is hip  as is the music - a fabulous wine bar with tasty food as well!"}
{"text":"My boss told me about this cool place to eat in Downtown Gilbert and it was indeed fantastic! Great food and impeccable service. Had a small wait at 3pm on a Sunday but they put us in some low padded arm chairs and a small table. Food order was taken quickly, and arrived just as fast. Anti pasto plate and some bruschetta fueled us up but thankfully we saved room for dessert. Don't leave without trying the creme br√ªl√©e!"}
{"text":"BRUSCHETTA! Whatever you do here, get the bruschetta. In fact, that's all we got! 

Stopped in around 3 after our flight, being slightly hungry but not wanting to spoil our dinner. We also ordered cucumber lemonade ... Soooo good and refreshing. The outside area is fabulous. The waitstaff is pleasant and attentive. Huge fan of this place. If I lived in the area I would visit frequently."}
{"text":"Great hang out spot! They're food is good, I just wish there was a bit more offered on their menu but other than that it is great! And the staff is always friendly"}
{"text":"Best bruschetta and wine! Love this place! Food is delicious and the service is always friendly!"}
{"text":"The food was good, ambiance was good but it was so incredibly loud on a Sunday afternoon that it was hard to talk and took away from what should have been an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Love love love the bruschetta. It's definitely one of a kind and very filling. My only compliant is the noise level and wait for a table. But that's expected on a Friday night. The food was quick and drinks very refilled very quickly. Overall fabulous experience."}
{"text":"My wife and another couple decided to go to Postinos at 7:00.   We were advised that it was going to be an hour wait. No problem  we will hang out in the front couch and have a few glasses of wine while we wait.  About 10 minutes later the hostess shows up and tells us we can't be sitting there, we say ok....   She moves us to a dining table by the bar, and proceeds to state we can sit here for dinner. After sitting for 30 seconds at the table we started getting soaked by the misters.  One of us went back to the hostess to be moved to a different table. She stated it would take a few minutes.  So we hung out at rear patio area, another 30 minutes went by with no call.  We went up front to the hostess and our name was dropped from the list.  Then they gave us another table up front and it too was soaked with water from the misters.   Now an hour and 20 minutes have gone by with no seating in sight.    Very disappointed at Postinos The wait staff with the drinks and water were great, but we will never  go there again. 

We walked across the street to Liberty Market and had our meal there within 20 minutes. It was excellent too."}
{"text":"Are you Gluten Free?  Are you jonesing for some great bread?  IT'S HERE!  AND POSTINO'S IS ALL OVER THE VALLEY!!!!  Dog friendly too!  Oh yeah, my husband is a vegetarian...This means that me (the GF chick) and he (the no-meat guy) are difficult to please.  Not at Postino's though.  

Extra points for having craft beers and a good wine list!  

I love you Postino's  xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants! The bruschetta is amazing. My favs are the brie & apples with fig, and the prosciutto with figs & marscapone (so good!!). And we really like the butcher block, so many yummy things to eat!"}
{"text":"This is defiantly a frequented spot for my friends and I, we have never had a bad experience here. We come a lot for the bottle and board special they have on Mondays and Tuesdays and there's usually a wait, but well worth it. I took my grandmother out for her birthday a few nights ago and it was her first time there, she absolutely loved it. Our server Nathan was just lovely, efficient and friendly and not just a robot taking an order. Kudos to you Postinos, keep up the great service!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Gilbert and it's great for socializing with friends or family. If you like wine, appetizers, comfortable seating, and a great ambiance then this is your place. Their cucumber lemonade is both yummy and refreshing. Their bruschettas are delicious! It's important to note that I this is more of a wine and tapas kind of place and it gets pretty packed on the weekends. I usually only come here when friends and family come to visit. Great mimosas and bellinis for brunch time drinks!"}
{"text":"Ok... coincidence or planned..... i happen to be sitting down right now at Postino east!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here before and found the experience delightful. Not this time.

On entering, we noted that the sound system was blasting music at an obnoxious volume--overpowering, even oppressive. Since it was clear that we'd be seated immediately, we said nothing to the hostess, instead waiting for our server, who arrived quickly. We asked if the music could be turned down. The response stunned us. We were informed in no uncertain terms that the loud music is \"part of who we (Postino) are.\"

The server's arrogance was palpable. On telling this person that we'd leave if the music were left at its mind-killing level, he replied that he could ask the bartender to \"turn the music down a notch or two,\" but that if \"someone complains, we'll have to turn it back up.\"

No apologies, just smugness.

We left, planning never to return.

We're not overly critical people. Bye-bye Postino East."}
{"text":"Love it! The bruschetta is amazing! Ambience is nice although it is quite loud. This is not the place to go if you want to have an in depth conversation unless you want to yell back and forth. But who cares if there is wine involved! So grateful they decided to expand to Gilbert. Downtown Gilbert needed a face lift and Postino has certainly added character to this sleepy suburb."}
{"text":"An ALL time Phoenix favorite of mine for lunch is Postino Arcadia, so I was excited to try their newest location. 

They are able to take something so simple (Brushetta, A Cheese Plate, Soups) and turn them into \"works of art,\" just as the original does. 

Their Brushetta, in addition to being beautiful to look at is absolutely FABULOUS Haven't had one I didn't like, in spite of the fact I am NOT all that fond of Smoked Salmon or Tuna, but loved their preparation!

Lots of fun to have many for a great selection with several people sharing. Probably ALL but the soups should be shared and even the soups can be, if you are with someone you really care about or ask for an additional empty bowl!

Very nice location and now with better weather, wide open.
If I had one complaint, the recorded music has been far too loud on both occasions I was there. Still a great place for lunch with a wide variety of wonderful things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and we had an amazing time. We sat outside and it's gorgeous in their courtyard. Food was good. My favorite was the red pepper with goat cheese. We also had a date and pistachio bruschetta (I think that's what it was if I remember correctly) and it kinda didn't taste like anything. We also had a pub board and the chorizo was delish! Their food isn't super heavy so I was nice not feeling super stuffed when we left ;)"}
{"text":"My sister took me here for my first time today and oh my goodness did I fall in love! The bruschetta is just freaking amazing! I haven't tried their other food yet but I sure will. Our waitress and just the staff in general was excellent also! I just had a great experience and can't wait to go back and bring people with me that can enjoy this delicious food too!"}
{"text":"What can you say about this place that hasn't already been said.  I was nervous about them building one in the east valley because I just can't stay away...it's that good!

The bruschetta is some of the best you will ever have.  They just make an investment in good quality ingredients and you can tell in your first bite.  I am so messed up now because I see bruschetta on menus at other restaurants and I just laugh.  No one does this better that Postino.

The wine section is over the top and you have to get there before five so you can get multiple libations for give bucks. There's always the mainstays of mimosas or bellinis for five bucks at any time if cash is tight.  Room at the bar is always tight so get there early.  

If there's a wait (which will happen on Friday and Saturday night), walk around because downtown Gilbert has lots to do.  They will text you when your table is ready.  

This place is one of my mainstays and is always good."}
{"text":"First time having bruschetta, yum, Got the one that comes with 4 and some wine (moscato). Absolutely delicious. Service was kinda slow and the lights are dimed to low at night time, could barely see our friends haha. Other than that, good atmosphere and great good. The only thing that really bothered us is they brought our appetizers the same time as food!"}
{"text":"I am giving them a 4 Star as no one is perfect. I read some of the previous reviews both positive and negative. I decided to give them a 3 visit review and see what's going on.

First off, the weekend evenings are packed and be prepared for a wait, but for me it was worth it.

I started with an assortment of the BRUSCHETTA'S.

Brie & Apples with Fig Spread
Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone
Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese
Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese

The selections were excellent but I settled on these 4 and I was not disappointed. The Fig spread was a wonderful surprise that offers a versatility beyond its pairing with Brie and Apples, which was spectacular.

The Tomato Jam and Sheeps Milk Cheese? Wonderful pretty much sums it up.

Visit 2 was lunch. I ordered the Autostrada Panini sandwich, the Italian meats were all top shelf quality, but it was the house pepper relish that brought it all together. They should bottle and sell that relish.

Visit 3 was Brunch. I brought a friend and went a little overboard on ordering. We started with the Butcher Block which is a wonderful assortment of Italian meats, cheeses, olives,breads, hummus's,and nuts. There were only two of us, but it could easily be the perfect warm up appetizer for 4.

Next up was the Farm Scramble, the Ciabatta French Toast and berries with a side of their Applewood Smoked Bacon.

I could go on and on describing how good it all was, but I would run out of room. Fabulous!!!!

Regarding the service, everybody was nice, seemed to back each other up for water glasses, bussing empty dishes, etc. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Great food and wine but Jason was the worst!!! He was so rude on so many occasions, he put his hand in my face to wave me off while I was ordering. I've never been so unimpressed with a server."}
{"text":"Had an amazing Sunday brunch at Postino in Gilbert. French toast was awesome! Mimosas were great of course and the staff were fabulous. Great place to go with friends and family!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Upward Projects, they know what they are doing when it comes to restaurants! On the flip side, I'm not a fan of wine, call me crazy, so Postinos is not my favorite but their prices for some of the wines are great so I will give one or two a try. The food is good, especially the Bruschetta. All in all, its a great place to hang and chat with friends."}
{"text":"Yes, we've lived here for 5 1/2 years and just finally tried Postino.  We went on a sunny, somewhat warm December afternoon and sat in a couple of comfy lounge chairs by the open doors.  The ambiance was great, service was great....almost too great.  A different server literally stopped and asked us if we were doing ok every 5 minutes.  I like it though.  We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Get here early on a Friday night or you may have to wait a couple of hours for a table. Great service. As always my favorite bruschettas in town and great wine by the glass for only $5 before 5pm. You can't beat that! It's nice that now there's a Postino in Arcadia, Central Phx, Tempe, Gilbert AND Scottsdale, so there is one bound to be close to you no matter where in the valley you live. :)"}
{"text":"Everything has ALWAYS been great here. Unfortunately when we came tonight, we were blatantly accused of pouring liquor into Sprite glasses- even though we had two bottles of wine. I placed my WATER between my legs because it was so dang hot (in AZ!) and within moments the manager was here asking if I had pour something in the drink. Um, no? Furthermore, from that point on, our server completely neglected us. The manager came over to apologize, but after coming here weekly for over a year and spending hundreds, if not thousands here, it was a. Incredibly rude and accusatory way to PRESUME something so erroneously. Also, even when offered to try or smell the liquid, they refused, still adamant we were being devious. The manager then proceeded to tell us multiple servers say witnessed this, yet, no one has EVER mentioned it? Except this little manager for the first time? And not even ask, but to accuse? Dude, it was water. If you have such problems with us, why allow us to come back? Why serve us every time and serve us WINE, yet you come at us in an accusatory manner? Completely RUDE, unprofessional, disrespectful, and inflammatory. We even sent the drink back and asked him to taste/smell it, but no, they wouldn't. And yet they still hold the accusatory tone. Search our purses and our persons! We have nothing to hide. That was an extremely terrible way to leave an establishment after being a loyal customer for nearly two years. Our bill is consistently $100+  and yet they still come at us with disrespectful accusations and false assumptions. 


We won't be coming back. 


-Update* I received a call from the regional manager, Brad, in relation to my above experience at Postino's. Initially, I was hopeful that someone of management took notice and concern of the incident. Brad apologized for my experience and stated he would investigate the complaint and get back with me. I received a follow-up call today from him and he communicated that at this time, they were going to leave everything \"as-is\" and supports the management actions last Friday. 
Pathetic. Negative word of mouth carries a lot of weight, and please know that no one from my group will be praising Postino's. Furthermore, this post alone as already prompted numerous users to message me and inquire about this incident. Please know that while this business may not care how it treats loyal customers of two years, potential patrons will be steered away. 

So as Brad put it, yes, we will \"leave as is,\" and not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"The cucumber lemonade should get 5 stars on their own. I love lemonade and I love cucumbers. Amazingness in my mouth! 
We had come for breakfast and now there wasn't much on their breakfast menu it's more of a place to come for obviously wine and bruschetta which is fine but good god I love the cucumber lemonade so much more than any other lemonade I've tried elsewhere next to hot dog on a stick(I know definitely now what you expected me to say right? Lol) anyhow i have yet to try the rest of the stuff here so we will add more next time we go!"}
{"text":"First time here and let me say this place is AWESOME! great food, great atmosphere, seriously in love! Everyone in Gilbert needs to give this place a shot."}
{"text":"The bruschetta is amazingggg! Havent had any like it before! Great service too . Go on a Mon or Tuesday after 8pm. They have bruschetta and excellent wine for 20 bucks! Great deal."}
{"text":"I love Postino's east!  Summer is hot but Postino found a way to keep us cool with optional indoor/outdoor seating. I love having shady areas to eat outside in the summer. When I heard they were offering yoga on Sunday's I was ecstatic! Who doesn't love yoga, wine and Sunday brunch with friends!?  The best part is the value $5 all day wine!!!   Alex did an awesome job serving our large group. Thank you Alex!"}
{"text":"So if you want to be a shot caller big baller you take your  friends here. Because those of us who hail from big cities... The LA's the San Francisco's, Chicago and east coasters know that this place consistently has great food, engaging polite staff and a wine list that can compete with a  bistro in Napa Valley. We winos who appreciate a good glass of wine with the food fixin's to go with, now have a place to go. Because where the heck do you go to impress your out of town friends in Gilbert. It's Postinos!"}
{"text":"I knew I would like this place when they were hiring they had a huge sign threat said, \"HIRING RAD PEOPLE!\" This place is full of awesome culture and amazing food.  A very hip and cool place to eat.  The food is fresh and delicious! Love the beat salad and the bruschetta.  Im eating a soup right now that is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Amazing! Our oldest son has eaten here before. He took us here with our two younger children to try something new for a change. We were definitely not disappointed. Servers were on point! Great job Madison and  co-workers. The food we ordered was AMAZING!!!!! We had the Mix and Match for our 7yr old little boy, 2 of the Nine Irons for our oldest son and his 17yr old sister, I had the Prosciutto with Brie and Fig jelly and my husband had a roast beef sandwich. We recommend to everyone that when you want to try something new and delicious, this is the place to go! Love Love Love and most definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here today! I have been here before & it was just as good. I have found my favorites so I'll be back to order them. try the passion tea its darn good!"}
{"text":"So, my best friend and I went here at 5:45 on a Friday night and had to wait an hour for a table. And I get it, it's Friday night, so we were mostly okay with that. Once we finally got a table, we ordered the bruschetta boards and tried about six of the options between us. Our favorites were the prosciutto, fig, and mascarpone; the artichoke spread; and the burrata, bacon, and arugula one. But they were all quite good, it was a lot of food (no need for dessert), and the service was pretty fast. So, all-in-all, a good place for dinner. And the price seemed reasonable. 

But I can't give this place five stars for one reason: the music. It was terrible--the song selections were grating and jarring and the volume was much too loud. We could hardly hear each other or the waiter, and I left with a headache. And we're only in our thirties, so it's not like we hate music. But it was just lousy music and far too loud. In the brief, peaceful interludes between songs, when you could actually hear yourself think, I thought, what a pleasant restaurant experience. And then the music started again, and I thought, we should've gotten the food to go. Sigh. Advice for the restaurant: lose the techno and punk rock music. Some of us go out to dinner so we can enjoy people's conversation. Being able to hear it helps."}
{"text":"I never thought I would see the day that I would be giving Postinos anything but a 5-star review because I've been going to Postinos in arcadia/phx for years and have been going to the new Gilbert location for the last 8 months, but ....and let me scream so you can hear me....,

 \"THE MUSIC IN GILBERT IS SOOOOO LOUD YOU CANNOT CARRY ON ANY KIND OF CONVERSATION!!!!!\" 

There.  I feel better.  Two other couples at tables next to us screamed \"Wow this is loud music\" as well....  It is not like this at the other two locations.

Management at Gilbert.... turn it down a notch or two.   A wine bar should be classy, relaxing and have an atmosphere condusive for great conversation, and all of those are impossible with the extremely LOUD music!  I would probably have ordered another bottle of wine, but I literally could not wait to leave!

Also, for the very first time EVER, when I ordered the butcher block there were items on the block missing!!  WTH???!!!  

Other than those two things, everything was spectacular...food tasted amazing (after bringing the missing items), service, people friendly...but I want to be able to carry on a conversation!  

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out on the patio and enjoy delicious food. We came here for date night on Monday and it was surprisingly busy but we got a table right away outside. The background music was the best (fun but not too loud). Our server was really sweet and gave us good recommendations. We loved the wine and the food we ordered. Had the board full of veggies which is AMAZING and not as boring as it sounds. Also, the bruschetta was sooo good. There was not one that I didn't like. Good place to come and relax especially with this perfect weather we have!!"}
{"text":"We love this place and have for many years. We've been to the phoenix locations countless times and tempe as well. Across the board the food is consistently good. We always get the garden salad, which they sweetly split in the kitchen, & a bruschetta board. Throw in some wine for me & a beer for my husband & it's a nice night! It's good for date night or group lunch with the girls. Splurge on the sundae with salted caramel & corn nuts. You'll want to drink the caramel right out of the shot glass."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 4 times now and I still cant put my finger on why its just average. It could be the Very Average service we recieve, or the mediocre food I seem to gravitate to. 

Pro's: Great location, beautiful decor, tons of people watching. (my favorite) Happy hour menu is ok, however it stops at 6, so hopefully you get off work prior to 5pm because if not, you'll need to be double fisted to get your buzz. If you do arrive before 5pm the menu has tons of good options to drink and eat. The brunch menu on Sunday is nice also. 

Con's: Service always seems to be a little off. Not sure why but every server I've ever had has been MIA most of the time. Always looking for another refill of water, where's my drink alot and can we get the check since we've been sitting here with empty plates and glasses for the pass 30 minutes. 

In the end I always leave a little dissapointed and enter anxious that this time it will be different."}
{"text":"Tried this wine bar for the first time last night...here's the scoop:

Liked
- great design...very hip
- good selection of wines
- excellent, friendly service

Not so much
- food was good but not as interesting as other wine bars we frequent
- too many kids...I know it's Gilbert and clientele is beyond the bar's control, but I don't want to hang out with kids and babies during my happy hour at a bar...can't imagine why people would think its ok to take kids to a bar."}
{"text":"Their bruschetta is the best I've ever had. Awesome patio, great food and drinks, super inviting atmosphere & friendly staff. Have been coming here for years and will continue to do so! Oh and order their pretzel, caramel, ice cream dessert. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in all of Arizona. I don't live there anymore, but this is my go-to spot for catching up with my old high school friends. The ambiance is cool and relaxed. 
They have a deal on Mondays and Tuesdays at 8pm where you get a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine for $20. Normally, a bruschetta board alone is $20, so this is a great bargain!
Even when i don't come for this deal, I always get a bruschetta board where you get to choose 4 different types of their bruschetta which are cut into four slices each; great for sharing. My \"must-haves\" are the fig/prosciutto/mascarpone and brie/apple/fig spread. Other ones that I like include smoked salmon/pesto and roasted peppers with goat cheese. 
There is usually a wait, and they do not take reservations except for larger parties. So I suggest getting there early or putting your name in and having a walk around the lovely downtown Gilbert area. I find that the wait does not usually die down the later in the evening."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a Postino closer to home.  

I'm not a \"wine guy\" but I still love Postino.  We had the pretzel board, Nine Iron Panini, bruchetta, cheese board, etc.  All excellent.  

Postino East was packed and rockin when we were there last week.  We saw lots of people we knew, how cool."}
{"text":"Experience was not my favorite. Been here once before and had a better experience.  We walked in and was sat down quickly. It was myself and my two girls.  They didn't offer or ask if we needed a kids menu and my daughter was very upset because we didn't know if they did.  The only reason we knew was because my little one went and saw one.   So we asked if we could have one. We ordered food and they came back to let us know they were out of GF bread. Ordered a drink and had to request it twice before it came and when it did we were done with our meals.  Place has great food just the visit was lack great service."}
{"text":"One thing that is great about this particular wine bar and restaurant is that it is consistent! The food is fresh, pretty and delicious! Service is great - you're never left waiting or wanting for anything, and the atmosphere is very inviting. Happy Hour wine prices are more than reasonable, and their wine selection is amazing. If you like fresh and delicious food in a friendly and comfortable atmosphere, you will love Postinos!"}
{"text":"love the monday and tuesday night special but always spend more than planned but always so good, especially the salads."}
{"text":"Wonderful trays of food. Here's the deal, you  want to plan to share. Great group go to!  It is LOUD, so don't plan the DTR talk for this place. Quite a wait too. But fun different and great taste. Wine selection great as well as adventurous for some!"}
{"text":"A great place for a girl's night out. Fantastic outdoor area.  Usually pretty crowded during peak times, so go early or for some day drinking. Nice wine selection, bruchettas, and salads."}
{"text":"Soo delicious and great service too. All their bruschetta is amazing especially the salmon with pesto. There's not a single visit that wasn't outstanding. Their waiters are very kind and attentive. Also, their prices are soo affordable it's amazing. I'm proud that Arizona has something to boast about when it comes to wine bars :)"}
{"text":"Wine, wine, wine....cheers!  I couldn't wait to go here.  Our 1st visit unfortunately was a Saturday at 5ish so we just missed HH.  It was packed.  Luck would have it we did get a seat at the bar (party of 4)...BUT, it took quite awhile before we got served.  So bar seating we were not impressed.  We put our name down for a table and the wait was over an hour.  We finally got our table 1.5hrs later. When we finally got our table and order our bottle of wine and food.  The food and wine was great!  Just getting to this point was aggravating.....plus we already spent 75+ bucks before we got seated. 

I will go back, because I love, love, love the Arcadia location.  I hope it was an off night.

Food/wine = 5 stars
Service that night =2.5/3starts"}
{"text":"We love this place, the food is always fabulous and the wine is absolutely the best especially when you have a waitress like McKenna, she is very knowledgeable in the wines and has always assisted us in the perfect wine selections. My favorite night is bottle and board night, they have the absolute best bruschetta!"}
{"text":"We sat at a nice table by a heater but we were brought three separate orders that were not ours before we even got our drinks buy separate waitstaff so we decided to get up and go to a place who would actually bring us our order"}
{"text":"Any bottle of wine and a board of cheese and meat for $20 on Monday and Tuesday nights.  Can't beat that! Great atmosphere, friendly attentive servers.  Get there early it fills up fast!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't that great! Kicked us out for another party. Bruschetta as ok and wine overpriced. I would not recommend for any future diners."}
{"text":"It's been almost 2 years since my last review and I've been a frequent flyer here. I love it. I actually have overwhelming cravings for the bruschetta sometimes. 

They've added a bocce court in the back and everytime I've gone recently there has been live music. And Gilbert being Gilbert, I love how this business has adapted to the community. It's pretty family friendly - as long as your kids are well behaved like mine :p (the kids menu is spot on).

Customer service has had it's ups and downs here for me (except for Scott who usually works at the bar. He is amazing and is always super friendly and very knowledgable about the wines and beers), but the quality of the food and the wine and beer selection are always top notch.

I love it here. And keep coming back over and over, my diet be damned."}
{"text":"Went here for a Sunday brunch while visiting friends. 

Ample parking across the street. Weather was a pleasant 80F with a nice breeze.

We had a wait time of about 5 mins to get a table for 4. We sat down and started with a mimosa, Bellini, beer and cucumber honey lemonade between the 4 of us. We all agreed the lemonade was very refreshing and smooth.

I ordered the B.E.L.T (basically BLT sandwich with eggs) which came with a small cup of fruit and she got the farm scramble. Both are delicious and perfect sized - not too much, just perfect. We shared the French toast. The friends got the Nine Iron panini and his wife got the French toast. 

Definitely love the ambience which is a combination of casual, modernistic and hippy."}
{"text":"It is quite seldom that I love a place. This may be one of the few. Went there during lunch hour on Sunday. The weather was perfect (maybe this added to my dining enjoyment- who knows), so we sat outside in the patio area. This establishment has a nice outside seating area with fireplaces and also a area for dogs to go potty. 
I also like that (even though this is a winebar), it is very family and kid friendly. They even got a kid's menu and some waxy stuff to play with. 

Anyways, on to the food. The bruschettas are a much here. If you com here and don't even try the Bruschetta planks, then don't even bother coming again. You are committing a crime. And don't be fooled by the portions of these. One person will definitely get full off of one order and it is plenty to share. Also got the rasberry chicken salad which was phenomenal. I'm not much of a wino, but seriously, this place rocks for the food!"}
{"text":"I had brunch here with a few friends. The service was a bit slow but we were there at a really busy time. The food was good, the atmosphere was great and the prices were reasonable. We all had a great time!"}
{"text":"5 Stars for the $20 bottle and bruschetta deal. It really doesn't get any better than that. However, my favorite meals here are lunch and the weekend brunch. The soups and sandwiches are delicious and the farm scramble is tasty. Great alternative for the two restaurants across the streets. Oh, and the mimosas aren't bad either."}
{"text":"The bruschetta is awesome. $12 for 4 different types. It was very filling we didn't have any room for our sandwiches. Will sit outside when the weather gets cooler. We went for lunch and it has a very nice atmosphere. Great place."}
{"text":"Just had a GREAT ladies night at this location! Nathan took great care of us. Sweet, attentive, and great advice on wine. Of course we'll be back for more, thanks!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, very slow. Waited almost an hour to be served once seated. Food was not worth the price. Roast Beef sandwich had two slices of meat, bread which was Focca, fell apart. Expensive for a sandwich. Would never go back. Limited menu. We went out to eat after we left."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in downtown Gilbert simply because their bruschetta board is to die for. There are about 12 different options to choose from and I've tried every single one and have not once been disappointed. The service is great but the wine choices are more expensive ($10-15/glass). I also wasn't a huge fan of the cheese board but any of their desserts will make up for it. The service is always very friendly. Great place for a girls night out!"}
{"text":"Came out here for a girls night and had a fantastic time. they have great seating inside or out. The bruschetta board was excellent and the wine selection was great!"}
{"text":"Why can't this be within walking distance from my house? Awesome specials, food, staff, vibe, everything! A great spot to hold a conversation, with good company. 

Made it in time for the daily special, $5 wine by the glass. I was able to indulge in a $12 glass, multiple times without concern of massive bill. - I don't usually drink on the week night, but if I ever have a rough Monday, I'll be here. $20 for bruschetta, and a bottle, on Mondays and Tuesdays.

The food was just wonderful. A girlfriend, and I split the Butchers Block and a bruschetta board. For our bruschetta choices, we went with: Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil, Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato, and Salami with Pesto. All were great, but we agreed that Smoked Salmon with Pesto was our favorite. 10/10 recommend it. I honestly cannot complain about the food at all. Everything was perfect!

There is a portion of the staff who is dedicated to topping off drinks, so your water glass will never hit empty. Our waitress was wonderful, and was very informative in selecting the right wine, for our taste. About halfway through our visit, our waitress was relieved by a waiter who was equally delightful, and considerate enough to do \"last call\" for the wine special.

The Restaurant has a very earthy/fresh vibe. Nothing felt generic. It's a place you can dress up or down for, and you will fit right in. 

There were a couple minor things that I felt could've improved my visit. One being, it was very warm in the restaurant. There are a lot of windows, and people walking in and out. I felt like I was sweating the entire time. The ladies, who we befriended, at the table beside us agreed. Maybe crank the AC a little lower. 
The other is that there's a bunch of stuff on the tables, for such small tables. Hadn't we been sharing, I don't think I would have noticed; but, the food here is meant to be shared, so it's awkward having to dodge and weave through wine glasses and salt shakers for a bite.

All in all, I will definitely be back soon! It's only been three days, and I'm craving some bruschetta! I want to try them all!"}
{"text":"Great food but the service can be a little spotty, especially when the restaurant is busy. The bruschetta board is the best thing to order, as well as the butchers block, an appetizer w various meats and cheeses."}
{"text":"My girls and I come here for happy hour all of the time.  I love the variety in bruchetta and in wine.  We've  been for brunch and the French toast with a mimosa starts the day off right. The staff is friendly and consistent. Never have a bad time at postinos."}
{"text":"I just LOVE having this place in downtown Gilbert! After seeing a show at Hale, it is great to have a place to get a nosh and a nice glass of wine...none of the other places stay open that late! I LOVE their artichoke dip and Hummus plate and their bruschetta is excellent also. Service can be a little slow sometimes....I don't think they always have enough servers in the later hours. But every server I have had has been pleasant and accomodating."}
{"text":"Very cute, trendy place with great service and tasty food. Portions are on the smaller side and prices a bit high, but that seems pretty typical in downtown Gilbert. Menu options were unique, beautifully presented and delicious. A great place to go with girlfriends.  Although I don't drink wine, they appeared to have a very nice selection."}
{"text":"I am taking away some stars from my first review.... the food here is still fabulous... but the service is lacking.   I have been here 5-6 times since they have opened and for some reason the last time the service was not that great.   The music was also WAY TOO LOUD!   We asked if it could be turned down just one notch and the response \" ha! I can ask, but i seriously doubt it\".   My profession is ears and hearing... this place was way too loud to enjoy a conversation and our order was even messed up because the server most likely could not hear due to the loudness!  Yikes!    When all the doors and windows are closed due to the summer heat--- TURN DOWN THE MUSIC  let people enjoy each other.    
The food is great... but I fear this business is getting the \"people love us so we don't have to care attitude\".     

I am done with Postino East for a while...."}
{"text":"Congratulations on opening the Gilbert location. Glad to see you guys making the shift to the far East Valley. As to be expected, the bruschetta was great. We really enjoyed the Syrah and the Sangiovese. It's really hard to beat the $5 glass/pitcher deal before 5pm, and the board + bottle ($20) on Monday and Tuesday night make for the perfect date night, though it can prove to create a long wait.

It was nice to see staff from the other locations making the move out here. Small mishaps and things that get confused in the midst of opening a new restaurant are bound to happen. No worries though, we've been 5 times in the first 10 days, showing that you guys are right on target. Looking forward to getting to know the staff and becoming weekly regulars."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Postion's I gave it a try and thoroughly enjoyed my experience.  The outside dining experience was one of the best with a fire in a fireplace, comfortable seating, expertly placed heat lamps and attentive service.  The wines were enjoyable and the food above average."}
{"text":"Light menu, especially if you don't drink haha. We had a bruschetta board (pick 4). It was so yummy! Full of flavor and good combinations. We tried the salami and pesto, apple and fig (my sweet favorite), mozzarella and tomato, and warm artichoke (my savory favorite)."}
{"text":"This place is great on Tuesday nite 4 bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20!! Awesome food!!!"}
{"text":"At first I was hoping for a more robust and complete menu for dinner. After sharing a grilled cheese sandwich, chicken and mozzarella sandwich, bruchetta, a cup of their tomato and smoked Gouda soup, as well as their Chocolate Bouchon, we were good. Everything paired very well with their wine selection. The wife and I will be back!"}
{"text":"So in love with this place. The food was to die for, as I can't get over their bruschetta options. Great presentation, and even better food combinations. The atmosphere is also nice, and the staff really knows their stuff. I ordered a wine I didn't love- and they had someone come out and find a wine that fit me best, and they didn't stop until I was pleased. Very cool place!"}
{"text":"While I have absolutely no complaints about the food, this review is for the service received.

The first time I received disrespectful service when I went with my best friend, I spoke to the manager about it and let it go. Now that this has happened again, I'm letting fellow Yelpers know. 

I went in with my boyfriend on a Monday around 2pm, it was not busy, yet there was no one there to greet us nor sit us down at a table. After standing there and seeing the other servers look at us, my boyfriend had to walk up to the bar and ask for help. It was only then that a guy came out from behind the bar to sit us down at a table. As he returned to the bar it took another few minutes before a girl came around to bring us two glasses of water and walk away. That was it, no greeting whatsoever! 

When we finally were able to order our food, the girl asked my boyfriend what kind of bread he wanted. As it was his first time there he didn't know what the options were and what the difference was between the breads. Instead of explaining it to him when he asked, the girl simply stared at him like he was stupid and asked again if he wanted chiabata or focaccia. So I had to explain it to him instead. TALK ABOUT BEING RUDE & DISRESPECTFUL! 

The rest of the time we were there, the only time we had any \"help\" from the servers was when they brought our food or refilled our water glasses. Not once did anyone say anything to us or ask if we needed anything. I wanted to ordered a drink but decided not to if they didn't even care to ask!

Note: I've never had an issue with the male staff/servers but the females are (excuse my language) b****es. They seriously need to hire female servers who are friendly and provide good customer service to EVERYONE!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Came here on a date with my wife after some friends suggested it. We were a little bit limited by my wife's pregnancy on what we were dining on, but our server was very informative and accommodating. The salad, soup and of course bruschetta were divine. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The bruschetta here is top notch, but I actually enjoyed Postino Central more, and the reason had more to do with the overall experience than the food. The one thing my husband and I really didn't enjoy about our trip to Postino East is that the restaurant itself is a little crammed, and where we were seated, we kept getting bumped into by servers and other guests going to the bathroom or the bar. It really kind of ruined the romantic vibe of the restaurant and made our date night feel a lot less intimate."}
{"text":"Cool patio and great bruschetta! Very tasty and great atmosphere. Come early for the $5 wine before 5pm to save some cash. Really enjoyed their patio and they even have some outdoor games. This area in Gilbert is booming and this location is a great addition to the culinary options available."}
{"text":"Everything is fantastic!! We love how all of the employees work as a team, they are all so helpful! Bruschetta is a MUST! The Butcher Block is also amazing! Who am I kidding everything they have is great, so fresh, delicious and obviously made to order!"}
{"text":"Yay! so glad to have one of these in the east valley.  Great open air set up. Good specials and super yummy eats. The wait gets very long but its worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love this place! The service is wonderful, and the pricing is affordable.

The food has yet to disappoint, and I have been there  multiple times.  As mentioned in another review from someone else, the music is spot on for the customers, @ the time of day"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! A quaint little spot that stays pretty busy. Prices are fair and the food is amazing!! I did a sandwich and salad duo and it was delicious. The service was great as well! A bit of a wait, but most definitely worth it. The atmosphere is wonderful :)"}
{"text":"The bottle and board deal is perfect for a night out. The service is always very good here. No downside. Wait can get long sometimes so be strategic."}
{"text":"I love Postino's! It's a great place to hang with my girlfriends! My hubby won't go with me to eat there unless I beg him but I LOVE it. I love wine, I love bruschetta, I love all the food they have there. It's totally my thing. Definitely a fun place to eat!"}
{"text":"I eat at Postino's for lunch occasionally and really enjoy it.  It definitely has a bit of counter culture flavor - a few tattoo's showing on staff and a wine bar in a heavily Morman area.  that said, the food is awesome.  The only criticism is the menu's a little short compared to a similar wine bar in Mesa.  The wine is very competitively priced and they have their wine by the glass \"happy hour\" which lasts all afternoon.  The staff is very professional - I haven't had a poor waiting experience.  Everyone chips in so water's always full and empty dishes quickly cleared away."}
{"text":"Love the ambience and the food is phenomenal. I've been twice and I'm already itching to return."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and quite busy on a weds night. Immediately got a table upon arriving and server quickly arrived and took our drink order and brought us water. 
They seated us next to some sort of little station where they store plates and the water pitchers. All the traffic from the  wait staff was highly fking annoying. My girlfriend kept getting her chair bumped as people were going back and forth getting plates and water. Not a good spot for a table or the little water/plate island you had there. 
The other thing I just couldn't get over was the sort of douchey pretentious vibe this place had. I was a tad put off at how our server(clearly some older broad who had hit the wall many years ago) sounded so fking snooty when she told us they don't serve alcohol. Not cool Bitch.
Got the bruschetta which, newsflash people, is glorified toast. Not sure why all the reviews raved about it, perhaps many just don't know better and think fancy toast with thinly sliced salmon is something very unique for some of you. It was decent at best, I've paid $15 for actual food that was much much better and far less hyped. 
Only good thing was the atmosphere. Definitely won't be heading back anytime soon as I wasn't all that impressed. Good for the try hards out there but I was very very unimpressed."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Food is delicious and service is always on point. Great place for celebrating, date night, or going out with the girls."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Great experience today at Postino. I had been wanting to try the bruschetta here after hearing rave reviews from many of my friends and it did not disappoint. Met my sister and mom here for an antipasti lunch and everything was delicious. We were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant. Water was served pretty much the moment we sat down which was great. Everyone working here seemed to be very happy and upbeat. We started off with one waitress who took our wine order and gave us some nice suggestions. I think she must have been transitioning shifts because another gentleman (presumably a manager) came out and took our food order. A few minutes later another waitress introduced herself and said she was taking over but even through all of that transition, wine was promptly served, food came out quickly and it all went smoothly. Waitress number three was with us the rest of the time and she was really nice and attentive.

For $14 you get a choice of four bruschetta's. We chose the apple and brie with fig, artichoke spread, fontina with bacon and tomato and salami with pesto. All were very good. The apple and brie with fig is very sweet so I liked saving that one for the end. We also order the soft pretzels with chorizo and white cheddar, it came out served with a variety of pickles, nuts and mustard and was delish! I am a girl who likes a combination of textures so this was very appealing. Everything was great. Atmosphere was relaxing for the lunch hour. Service was great. $5 wine from 11am-5pm. 

I spotted someone noshing on a salted caramel sundae before leaving and I felt quite sad that I did not indulge in one of those. It gives me an excuse to come back. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Bruschetta was excellent! Very good wine selection. Nice atmosphere, and not so loud that you cannot hear your company. Waitstaff is attentive and well-versed in their product. Good music, my boyfriend and I had fun playing name the artisit. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Although I had seen it as I wandered downtown I didn't think to go in. A friend told me it is a must. The food was perfect and so is the atmosphere. In fact I think I will head back today."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome! If you join their ePosse, you can you call the day before to make reservations even if they have too many reservations, they'll get you in.
Their food is amazing too!"}
{"text":"CONSISTENCY. That's what I love most about Postino. Everything you order always has the same taste and freshness that you can count on. Their soup is never 'off' and their bruschetta (especially the gluten free) is always on point regardless of the combination. We always start with the olives, and they have so much diversity and flavor in the bowl. Perfect for snacking while enjoying your glass of wine. The kids meals all come with wikisticks for stimulating their little creative minds and encouraging fine motor skill development. Man! What more could I say about a place THIS thoughtful. Even their bathrooms are a place worth checking out. Lots of eclectic decor and the music is very hip. I shazzam a song at least once every time I dine here."}
{"text":"Over the years I went to this location many times, and I had never try there special Bruschetta & wine on Mondays and Tuesdays I decided to went on a Monday night. After 45min wait we finally got a table for 2, we order a bottle of sparkling to start and the bruschetta. None of the each pieces on the board were good as they were presented. They were all flavorless, and the salt and pepper on the table didn't help much. So we decide to order another round of wine and bruschetta and chose all different ones, and It wasn't better. The service is impersonal as usual, they are 10 servers who come to your table and you have no idea who's your server. The three stars are for the really good deal they propose ($20 a bottle of wine of your choice and bruschetta) and also for the good bread they have!"}
{"text":"Great salads & paninis. Nice wine selection and reasonably priced. Not trying to be everything, just excellent, simple food and a great wine and beer selection. Only negative was the music was just a bit loud."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Wish they had one on every block! Great specials $5 pitchers until 5pm Everyday! The bruschettas are the best in the area by far. This place is one of our favorites. It's hip and plenty of space for groups!"}
{"text":"Simple but wonderful and Never disappoints! It's always busy (good sign) but service is always great."}
{"text":"Very nice place to hang out. Lots of choices of wines and beer. Food was also very good. Staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"This place is so good! A little bit of a wait for a Friday evening was to be expected, you can enjoy a drink while you wait or walk down to the food truck court across from Barrio Queen and wander on Friday nights. They text you when your table is ready which is awesome! Prosciutto with Brie panini is to die for, great combo of salty and sweet. Our server was great and attentive, he made an effort to engage in conversation and was very helpful with questions about the menu. The wine I selected was a little bitter, maybe just a bad bottle? I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was truly a great experience that made us want to come back for more! Busy Saturday night, told about 45 min wait. We were seated in 20 mins. Big plus there. Madison was our server and she was great and helpful with menu selection and spirits. Had the Bruschetta board with Warm Artichoke spread, Apple Fig and Brea, Burrata Bacon & Roasted Pepper. All were great and unique in flavor. Got to split between 2 people. Then we had a Roast Beef panini w/ side salad which was very good. For spirits we had Huss Orange Blossom and the Tangerine IPA. Both very good and different from each other as well. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's the perfect place to grab a glass of wine (or 2!) and share their delicious bruschetta plates with your girlfriends. They have an afternoon happy hour (who doesn't like that?!) and even though I have only tried their bruschettas, all of the different options are so good it's hard to choose! The staff is always very friendly and service is speedy, even when they are super busy. This place would also be a cute date night spot : )"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in downtown Gilbert. The food is amazing and they serve great wine from all over the country. I love the outdoor patio area, especially at night with all the lights it creates a very Mediterranean feeling."}
{"text":"What I love the most about Postino is the ambiance and decoration, they have a lovely patio. I haven't tried a lot on their menu, however the Butcher's Block is very nice, meat and cheeses for $14.50 is quite a nice deal. Their French Grenache was very good, it went well with the board. Overall, I will be back, either for a date or just with friends."}
{"text":"Since when did a wine place become a kids place. Went with the lady on a sunday at about 10:45. By noon we were surrounded by moms with 2-3 kids all over the place. One even had a bunch of baby food with her, Tacky!!!! Other then that, place is great. Had the butcher block. Def be back. Hopefully this time its not \"bring your kid day\" at the wine bar."}
{"text":"I really like wine. That said, I was pretty happy that Postino came to Gilbert, and I had another wine bar to frequent. They are almost always on a wait so get there early! The bruchetta boards are delicious- I have yet to try a variety that I don't like. I also came for breakfast once, and that food was good too.

The only downside of Postino for me is the service. It's definitely hit or miss. For instance, on my last visit, my girlfriends and I waited over an hour and 20 minutes for our food. The server who took our order was oblivious to our problem, even after we told her we were still waiting (after 45 minutes). She was either too busy with other tables or just didn't care. I'm confident that if there hadn't been a shift change during our wait, we never would have gotten food. While we were still waiting for our meal, the second server asked us if we would be ordering dessert, and once we told her what was going on, she immediately took care of it. She put our order in again- who knows what happened the first time around- and we had food in 10 minutes. We didn't ask for anything to be comped, but she did it anyway. She was apologetic and gracious, and we appreciated her taking initiative and responsibility for something that was definitely not her fault. Her service turned around our experience. I just wish I had caught her name to ask for her section next time."}
{"text":"I do not understand the high reviews for this place or why it is so popular in the evenings. It might be OK for lunch, but they don't have any dinner food. They just have sandwiches and appetizers. I had to wait 45 minutes for a table on a Thursday night and then it cost me $35 for one glass of wine and some bruschetta. Some of the bruschetta was pretty good, but after I was done, I felt like I still needed to go somewhere to get some real dinner."}
{"text":"I really love their happy hour, which is available 7 days a week until 5pm.  The ambiance is great and the staff is excellent.  I come here reguarly and enjoy the outdoors seating, good wine and food."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent, great service, have visited many times - always a great experience. Comfortable seating, welcoming environment, really a fantastic place to enjoy some food, drink and relax."}
{"text":"Postino is at the top of my spots to day drink list.  Open to 5pm you get $5 pitchers of beer and glasses of wine so if that's not reason enough to go, you're hopeless.  The food is always good and this location is very open and bright.  It's a perfect place for a crowd, a couple or even a solo diner."}
{"text":"The other  Phoenix locations are wonderful; this one not as good. Tried it a 2nd time - it's the servers - arrogant both times & acting too busy to be pleasant .  Food is as good as the other locations. Twenty-year olds love this place!"}
{"text":"It's was good. Adam was our server...has a great look that matches the restaurant. Cool vibe. It was windy, but made the temperature perfect. Food was good and fun. Server recommended food was great. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We finally had Brunch at Postino's East and it was amazing! We shard the Farmhouse Scramble and the French Toast. 

The scramble was perfectly cooked - the potatoes flavorful and the gruyere was the perfect cheese. The side salad and tomatoes were the perfect accompaniment.

The french toast was by far the best restaurant french toast I've eaten in a LONG time. I make my own french toast that my husband and I both drool over - but Postino's has definitely mastered their french toast dish. The creme fresh with sliced almonds and the fresh fruit compote....need I say more?"}
{"text":"I have no idea of the what/when/who of why the service was bashed here?  Just visited for first time and the service was great!  It's not an extensive menu, but it is not supposed to be, it's a wine bar.  With that being said the bruschetta's are amazing.  Thank you Bryan, our server, for the wonderful service, great job and we will be back."}
{"text":"Thrilled Postino made it to Gilbert, but I prefer the vibe in Arcadia, where they've really managed to capture the spirit of a European wine bar--you know, without kids running all over the place. The \"family friendly\" atmosphere in Gilbert fits well with the community, but for me it's a bit of a turn-off. Most of the parents are trying to socialize with friends and aren't paying attention to their little ones anyway. Can't we have some grown-up restaurants in Gilbert, too?

The food is predictably solid (though the smoked salmon at brunch could use more smoke--and more salmon) and the wine is consistently delightful, but it's the service, staff, and culture that Craig DeMarco and his team have created that keeps us coming back. Kids or no kids.

Oh, when you go... order the salted caramel sundae."}
{"text":"I love this place, their wine is delicious and the fact that while you wait for your party you can get a glass is even better.  Other best thing are their boards and their brochette!  Love the fig and prociutto but honestly haven't had any bad ones yet."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Postino East! The food gets five stars. It is fresh, tastes amazing, and there is a good variety of sandwiches, soup, and salads. I eat here once a week. The service gets four stars. The wait staff is very pleasant but is usually slow. They do a team approach and I often think they assume the other has taken care of you, when in fact no one has been over at all. Overall this place rocks and I will continue to be a regular. This is my go to place for a delicious lunch."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience... we get here at 5pm... party of 3... and you refuse to seat us because there are going to be 2 large parties later!?!?! There were 5 open tables, this is completely unacceptable!!!"}
{"text":"As a member of the ePosse, I went to Postino East for the free bruschetta that came as a gift for joining the ePosse and getting their newsletter. I have to agree with the Yelpers of days gone by that the food is terrific. We net for lunch yesterday (Friday) and the place was very busy. A public parking area is behind the restaurant so parking is plentiful. We sat at the bar, that was open to the outside and it was a beautiful sunny day. We ordered two wines from the $5 menu that is offered from 11am-5pm. They were light fruity, Chardonnays that worked well with a light lunch. We got the olive appetizer to start and shared the bruschetta. The service was good at the bar. The food was excellent. We did sit by the service end of the bar by the kitchen so it was a bit noisy but that is expected with a lot of wait staff talking to the kitchen staff about upcoming orders. The next time we will look for a seat on the other side of the bar. They have plenty of outdoor areas and a large indoor seating area."}
{"text":"The food was good, the wait was not too bad.  I ordered some freschetta it was tasty.  The ambiance was nice and it seemed like the happening place to go."}
{"text":"Awesome serivce every time! The food is good too:)
I love their Monday Tuesday specials!"}
{"text":"The advantage of being in a small and picturesque  downtown area definitely helps.
The ambience and the service is great.
They have ample wine and beer options and I always appreciate the smaller beer glasses($3),which give more opportunities to try more.

The brushettas were fresh and appetizing and turkey panini tasted great!"}
{"text":"Love the new no wait app also. We live 5 mins away and now I can check in and don't have to do the long wait."}
{"text":"Oh Postino. My only complaint is that I live in another state and won't be able to come back soon. Great atmosphere (nice but not stuffy) great prices and ridiculously good pub board appetizers! Service was lovely as well. Our server picked one of our bruschetta options since they all sounded yums and he picked a good one with the salmon. Other options were brie and apple, pepper jam and goat cheese and buratta, bacon and arugula. All worth stuffing your face!"}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday brunch with my wife and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The service was spot on! It was a pretty chilly morning and our server basically dropped everything to make sure we were comfortable at our outside table by placing a heater next to us. Now that's what I call customer service!

I ordered the country toast and my wife ordered the salmon. While the portions may appear to be not that large for a brunch meal, they were definitely filling enough. I also highly recommend the mimosas, which are better than many I've tried elsewhere.

Finally, the music choice: superb! Did not expect to hear 90s gangsta rap with my brunch but absolutely loved it! ;D

Needless to say this won't be the last time we visit Postino!"}
{"text":"Just had the best breakfast!!! So delicious and fresh. It wasn't just your run of the mill eggs and toast. Very flavourful and I'm definitely coming back. Bob was my adorable server and Sam my hostess...both gave me Awesomeness service. Thank you Postinos!!"}
{"text":"I am a business traveler monthly to the Phoenix area and like to explore new restaurants if not too tired. I missed having my husband with me for this gem. Comfortable, casual but upscale. Nice selection of wines by the glass. Perfect if you want to sample a variety of flavors for a meal but not too heavy. I chose a garden salad and half order of bruschetta.  I did the fig & apple and sweet & spicy pepper jam which was excellent. I will be more adventurous next time.  The background music was enjoyable. Inside and patio seating. Definitely worth another visit. Parking was easy, especially compared to Tempe the night before."}
{"text":"Service: Amazing. Food: Amazing. Overall experience: Amazing. We came here for wine and nosh and loved it. First time here too. Our server McKinnley was very helpful."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been making the trek to Arcadia for years now and have always said \"if they ever put a Postino in Gilbert, it would be game over.\"  Diary read - it's happened!  The place has always been known for great wine selection, unbeatable bruschetta, and friendly service, and the new Gilbert location definitely doesn't disappoint.  They have a friendly response to every question and a recommendation for every taste; they simply don't care if you're a wine expert or a first time visitor, they are just happy you're there.

It's so nice to have a chic place like this in downtown Gilbert.  As we drove through on Friday night, the downtown area was bustling with couples and families alike.  Milling around between the \"Big 3\" of Liberty Market, Joe's BBQ, and Postino, and there was a sense of buzz and community - it was very exciting to see.  

A few recommendations:

1. Don't be afraid of the \"Tomato Jam\" Bruschetta.  It's delicious and, while it sounds strange, is arguably their best board.
2. Every day (yes, even on the weekends) between 11am and 5pm they offer $5 glasses of wine and pitchers of beer.  We're not talking cheap wine and Bud Light either.  ANY glass of wine and beer is up for grabs, so spoil yourself a little bit!
3. If it's just two of you, take a seat at the bar and strike up a conversation with the bartenders and the fellow wine-goers.  We've done this at each location and have found ourselves enjoying our time better than just getting tucked away by ourselves.
4. The Salted Caramel Sundae is the best dessert in town.  Period.

Have fun and make a night of it - you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with an out of town friend who had just arrived for a visit. It was past the normal lunch hour, but the place was packed! We were able to find two seats at the bar, so enjoyed some Chardonnay while waiting for an outside table. The $20 per bottle wine was an excellent deal and the wine was good! We were seated at an outside table before long. We had a tough time deciding what to order, but settled on The Butcher Block and The Bounty. It was a lot of food, but the two choices provided the perfect combination! I would definitely choose the same items again. The service was great, the food was excellent, and the outdoor seating was cozy and comfortable. I have another out of town guest coming soon, and guess where we will be going for lunch? Postino East, of course!"}
{"text":"Well, it's Postino. Great wine selections, excellent nosh options (must try the ricotta, dates, pistachio bruschetta), and a fun atmosphere. This is a locally owned \"chain\" and is the newest spot in downtown Gilbert. It's always busy, with a good crowd. The folks who manage the place have great taste in music as the \"playlist\" is always filled with juicy hipster indie hits.

Postina is a fun place for friends to gather, enjoy some drinks, and take in a great hip atmosphere. It's affordable (especially during happy hour), and a great way to try new wines or beers. It's also a good date night spot.

The parking is pretty awful. Be prepared to walk some, especially on weekends and happy hour. Postina East is situated in a hot spot of downtown Gilbert favorites- Liberty Market, Oreganos, etc. It's quite the popular area and the lack of parking proves it."}
{"text":"Food was good and wine was good!

We were told it would be a 15 minute wait..that turned into 25 minutes. The host kept us updated which I appreciated. {I'm a server, so I can totally understand when people just chat at their tables an hour AFTER being payed out.}

I wish they had more servers on the floor.

It took 10 minutes until we were greeted. We got our wine right away. Then we waited another 15 minutes until he took our order. I noticed that they have food AND wine runners, so i'm not too sure how they are so busy..

When we were finished eating, I wanted to order dessert. We were sitting there probably another 15 minutes before the host asked to get us a box for our food (obviously he needed our table). I had to give HIM my dessert order because I didn't know when my server would be back, and I felt bad for taking up their table for so long.

tl;dr The service could be quicker..Food/wine was good though and a good price."}
{"text":"We were not impressed .... Long long wait for different things on bread . Hosts might need more training ."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend & I went to Postino's East yesterday & it was just as good as all the reviews state, maybe even better. 
We went for dinner & had a 30 minute wait, but we just took that as time to walk around & get to know downtown Gilbert. We got our table right on time. When we were seated we were promptly given water & time to look over the menu. 
Our server was AMAZING! I feel like a jerk because I don't recall his name, but he was very attentive, personable, & helpful. 
My boyfriend & I both got the select two deal, half a sandwich & soup or salad. I got the Prosciutto with Brie with Mixed Greens while he got the Turkey with the soup of the moment (a red pepper tomato soup). We were both happily impressed. My sandwich was the perfect combination of sweet and salty & my salad was a great balance of bitter greens, sweet dressing, & salty cheese. 
I also had the Cucumber Honey Lemonade. I just wanted to try it really bad! It was definitely interesting. Sweet from the honey, salty & sour from the lemonade..the cucumber was refreshing, but also reminded me of pickles. Still not sure how I feel about it haha. 
Lastly, we had the Salted Caramel Sundae for dessert & it was just as it sounds. Yummy. Came with pretzel sticks & nuts. 
Altogether we had a great experience & will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Finally made it for brunch. Was not disappointed. I had the French toast. Went on a sunny, beautiful Saturday morning. The sliding glass doors were all open. Great food, service, and experience."}
{"text":"LOVE Postino's I love that they have a pitcher special everyday, and on Mondays their bruchetta and wine for 20 is unbeatable. Specially for a girls dinner night. food is awesome! atmosphere AWESOME! needs to be bigger tho its always so crowded!"}
{"text":"Great food, service & ambiance!!! I forgot we were in Gilbert... Best bruschetta, bellinis & red pepper & Gouda soup. Our waitress was so helpful. Will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Super popular wine bar in the heart of Gilbert.  Great wine selections and the bruschetta is to die for.   Be prepared for a wait for a table though.... popular they are!   Monday night special was bottle of wine and bruschetta board for $20.  Definitely a great deal!"}
{"text":"The service at Postino  is AMAzIng!!! The food and wine are equally good! We ordered the raspberry chicken salad and the butcher board. If was perfect. The ambiance of the patio is so great. There is nothing better than good company, good food, great service and perfect ambiance! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This was my first time to Postino after many months of wanting to try it and let me say my family and I were not disappointed. We started off ordering wine from Morgan who we thought was awesome but ended up having to transfer once our table was ready. The wine was amazing as well as the atmosphere and we all loved our food, we will definitely be back. That being said our server Felix was terrible. It was busy when we first arrived, and as a server I understand it takes time to go around to all your tables, but he came by maybe four times while we were there. He had no personality and never tried to make any small talk or connect with us at all. After our food was brought out he came around once to see if we needed anything but didn't refill the empty soda on our table until we asked and we didn't see him again until we were ready to leave. Lindsay ended up bringing the refill back and she is the reason I am giving five stars because next time we come we are requesting her. She was very friendly and helpful, continued to refilled our drinks, checked on us more than Felix, pre-bussed our table and even took and paid out our tab. I look forward to trying something new next time with her as my server."}
{"text":"Had a girl's night out early dinner here. Ordered the bruschetta board with the warm artichoke, prosciutto/fig, apple/Brie, and date/pistachio selection.

Nothing memorable about any of them. The restaurant itself was nice, and would make for a good date."}
{"text":"Such a great way to spend date night with my husband! The waiter recommended the Riesling wine because we asked for a wine on the sweeter side and this wine was amazing! Their assortment of bruschetta is always a good and light food to have paired with wine. Love the concept of this place and definitely love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Postino East is on of my favorite places to go for lunch. Great staff, great food and outstanding wine list. We used to have to drive to Arcadia until they opened the one out here. Happy Hours are great too!"}
{"text":"Love their brunch here, French toast is the best, but absolutely the worst coffee, they could do better by getting it from circle k.  Service is top notch 5 stars if they ever fix the coffee.."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, great customer service and delicious food. Go with the bruschetta all the way!"}
{"text":"Love their Happy hour deals on Monday and Tuesday! 
Can be pricey but worth it.
Atmosphere is cozy in the evening."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. They have the BEST bruschetta (especially the tomato jam one). They also have an awesome happy hour which includes $5 pitchers of beer, and they have a great selection. The staff is great, everyone is always friendly and service is always prompt. The atmosphere is very comfortable and my husband and I go there on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The green apple and smoked salmon bruschetta was amazing and the mozzarella and cheese panini was great!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. Always a great experience! I love the butcher block appetizer and the bruschetta has so many different varieties, its hard to go wrong."}
{"text":"Service attention varies and sometimes feels rushed. Host also takes orders. Apps and main course arrive together. This annoys me. It is loud. At bar, wine was not poured, it was given to me to pour myself. On another day, it was poured. All this aside....food gets 5 stars. Menu is delicious. The green salad and bruschetta perfect concert of flavors. Have eaten them three days in a row."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with wifey and our good friends on a Saturday.  Beat the lunch crowd so that was awesome.  This place was already packed but was able to sit right down at a table.  Nice atmosphere with a hip wait staff.  Looks like a kid friendly place as blankets and pillows were laid out and kids running around on the grassy area in the back.  My wife and my buddy ordered the Smoked Salmon, his wife ordered the Raspberry Chicken salad, and I ordered the Bruschetta (Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil, Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese, Salami with Pesto).  According to my wife the Salmon was very good and my buddies plate was clean so that says it all.  The salad looked good but she didn't finish it but really, if you order a salad, you are not trying to finish everything on your plate.  As for me, I liked all my selections for the Bruschetta.  The Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil and the Salami with Pesto was good but my favorite was the Smoked Salmon with Pesto.  Oh, I also had the regular Lemonade.  One of the best I have ever tasted.  My buddy got the Cucumber Honey Lemonade and I don't know if he liked it that much.  I know for sure he didn't like that refills were not free for his drink.  The ladies had the White Peach Bellini and it was alright.  I will be going back for sure.  So much things I saw on other tables that I want to try.  Not a wine drinker but from what I saw they have a lot to offer with drink specials and numerous beers and other spirits.  Go there if you want a light meal that will not weigh you down and a fun time with your friends."}
{"text":"Love the wine/bruschetta nights! Great time to go out with the girls!! We love the staff here, they are both kind and knowledgeable. Highly recommend trying."}
{"text":"As Wine based eateries go, this one is very good. There is an excellant selection of wine. So many to choose from . There are some wonderful dishes to tempt your taste buds. I love the sandwiches and apps.
Honestly, the things that keeps me coming back is the Cucumber Lemonade. I always mention it to friends if the spot comes up for a recommendation.
I love it. I think it would be perfect with a shot of rum. My next request.
It can be hard to get it, but worth the effort."}
{"text":"Had a great post tattoo meal here with my sister. The guys serving at the bar were very attentive and had a great sense of humor which made our wait for food pass smoothly. The food was delicious. We both enjoyed splitting the bruchetta and loved the tomato jam. The noise level was a little intense but all in all a good trip out."}
{"text":"Visited postinos on a warm Saturday night with a few friends and it was packed. We waited a little for a table but you can order while waiting for a table too which is pretty cool. 
The food isn't too shabby. There's sandwiches and bruschetta. The latter was enjoyed by my friends. They mentioned that it was 'pretty good.' I had a sandwich was a reasonably sized and tasty. The wines they had were also flavorful. However I've gotta say that the drinks are pricey! 
Good atmosphere for a warm night but too $$$. I'd like to check it out again during their Monday and Tuesday specials for the $20 deal. That's a bit more reasonable."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for brunch on my birthday, we had a party of 13 and they were very accommodating ( they'll take reservations for parties of 8 or more with a 24 hour notice). The food was delicious, as were the peach Bellini's I had;-) We ordered off the brunch menu, and some bruschetta. Very pleasant, and positive experience!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. I live really close and was disappointed in myself I hadn't gone yet. My wife and her girlfriends go frequently for the bottle of wine and platter deal they have there. The food is outstanding - fresh ingredients and tasteful. Staff can be a bit wine restaurant snooty but nonetheless they were on top of their game and we never waited (large group of 12). Look forward to going back frequently."}
{"text":"I've reviewed other Postino locations & I've always said I don't know how to make this review any different than others ones I've written because all there locations are consistently excellent. 

Everything about this location is fantastic as well from the food to the service. I really do love the area this one is located. It's right on the main stretch of Gilbert where there's a lot of options. There's a really patio here to dine at when the weather is nice. 

One thing I can add about this particular location is that it's the only one I ever had brunch at (I'm a bruschetta board & wine guy). It was a while ago, but I remember it being eggscellent."}
{"text":"Every experience at Postino is a great experience! The staff is AMAZING. Every person we've ever encountered has been wonderful. 

If you live in Chandler, Gilbert or Mesa, this is definitely the place to be! You can't beat Postino's happy hour or bruschetta. Go to their website and sign up for their email list. They are great about sending their customers incentives to dine at their restaurants."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat when I crave for italian. The bruschetta boards here are amazing. The combination of brie and apple with fig spread, how delicious! Warm artichoke spread and Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese are my favorites here. I love the ambiance of this place, they have couches and tables in the patio. I saw people lay their mats and had a picnic outside but not perfect for this 100' weather. I just want to go back and sink my teeth on those delicious bruschetta."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very elegant. You are able to sit outside or inside. Outside has a bocce green which is actually pretty fun. The food was very different and the selection is very minimal. It was pretty delicious but since there is only a small selection of food some people may not be able to find something they like. This is a rare 4 star review when the food for one reason or another isn't up to my standard. The scenery was that stunning though so I couldn't give lower than 4 stars. Check the menu before you decide to come here to make sure there is something you like."}
{"text":"Good food  and the waitresses and hostess were great. We bought a bottle of champagne an were told we could cork the rest and take it with us. I guess the waitress was wrong and were not able, so we asked to just be charged for the glasses, but manger was such a jerk. Had a huge attitude and was rude. Super disappointed! I have always loved this place."}
{"text":"Didn't even get a chance to try their food. 

After walking for half an hour down Downtown Gilbert for my father's birthday, we decided to settle at Postino's. 

It was pretty busy and there was a group of two ladies in front of me. The workers didn't greet us and decided to help the two ladies but never came back. We sat there waiting for over 10 minutes and no one updated us to say there were no seats or anything, we were not spoken to even when the employees clearly saw us. We left after a while because of this unprofessional behavior. 

It then occurred to me that it could have been the fact that we were Asian? They decided to help the American ladies who were dressed \"nicer\" but our family wasn't even dressed inappropriately for the occasion, we were dressed in \"going out to dinner\" attire. *Not that what you wear should determine whether or not you eat.* I hope they know my mother worked as a waitress (my sister and I as well for a while) and knew the exact struggles of being one so our whole family usually tips very well. Too bad they will never see it from us!

Sucks to see no one decided to help us when we arrived and stayed around. I want to try this restaurant but definitely not this location. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Great meal as usual....Server supporter Kelsi was wonderful, and Lindsey was great !! A must visit !!!"}
{"text":"Had the butchers block and two orders of the bruschetta with my wife for our anniversary and it was a bit more than we needed.  Everything was delicious, but we were most impressed by the apple with fig jam, the smoked salmon with pesto, and the BBAT.  The warm artichoke spread was recommended, but that was our least favorite.  Prosciutto with figs and mascarpone also gets a thumbs up."}
{"text":"My boyfriend suggested that him and I try this place after his coworkers said how \"great\" it was. Customer service is great, sandwich & salad were ok. The chicken and mozzarella sandwich is bland. But the bruschetta was very good. So we definitely will be back for just the bruschetta."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here. We went on a Tuesday and it was packed. We were told they had a 45 minute wait.  We found a couch outside we were told we could sit at, so we went there. I ordered a nice pinot noir and we had a meat and cheese board to start.  The board had 4 meats, cheese, hummus, and plenty  of olives . 
Next we had bruschetta. I had a board that had Apple, brie and fig preserve,  one that had figs and marscapone, one smoked salmon and the last had bacon. I normally pass on bread, but this was worth it."}
{"text":"My first time at Postino's was for brunch with a friend. We both ordered the scrambled eggs with fresh fruit and shared some of the walnut toast with Brie cheese and jam, my oh my was it delicious! 

My second trip was for dinner with a group of girls, I wanted to try the bruschetta but we weren't all agreeable so we each ordered a 1/2 sandwich and salad combo. I ordered a chicken sandwich and it was pretty bland, the bread was super thick and on the almost too hard side and I had a hard time eating it, my mouth was all torn up.

 I think this place is great based on my first experience. I would like to go back for brunch and I will give the bruschetta a try for dinner if we go again. I would hope they add a few more items to their dinner menu."}
{"text":"So, recently Vegan (2 months) and One of the bartenders Scott took the time to suggest the most delicious Vegan bruschetta platter I have ever had! I mean, it was incredible! No doubt this will be our Sunday treat Spot. Great service great food. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Now THIS is what a wine bar SHOULD be.  Stellar staff.  Excellent selection of wines (we opted for a delicious Albari√±o from Spain).  The food was tapas-sized offerings of very fresh and flavorful offerings.  Facility is super clean and well laid out with tables inside and out, plenty of room at the bar, and nice outdoor places for standing.  Atmosphere is relaxed and unrushed.  Esposa and I give Postino East two thumbs way, way up."}
{"text":"Great wine, food, and atmosphere!  Definitely worth checking out.  Especially if it is nice weather."}
{"text":"We only found this place by accident.  We needed to kill time and figured we might as well do it here.  The place was packed but we were seated in less than 5 minutes on the patio by the misters.  It was warm and we really loved the misters.

The menu was a little different for us and we weren't quite sure what to order.  Our waiter helped a bit with that.  He was great and kept checking back with us until our food arrived. The food was absolutely delicious too.  

So, why the 4 stars?  Well, the water glasses are really small and getting refills wasn't easy.  Trying to get the attention of the girl pouring water was also difficult.  We eventually got up and filled our empty glasses ourselves.   When we mentioned it to her, she just looked at us and walked off."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and absolutely LOVE it. I don't even care that you have to wait an hour to get a table because the little outside waiting area has a server to bring you a glass or even bottle of wine! I love, love, love the bruschetta. It's so delicious. I moved to Gilbert so I am looking forward to going for happy hour soon. You will not be disappointed when you dine here!"}
{"text":"I love this place especially in the fall and spring. It's a great meeting place and the service is friendly and quick. This place is busy on weekends and happy hour which of course means a long wait. I've gone at all times of day and the longest I've waited for a seat was 20 minutes during rush hour. They have yummy appetizers and for the meat and cheese lovers try the Butchers Block."}
{"text":"After visiting the location in Phoenix I couldn't wait to go back to the closer location in Gilbert. I am not sure if I just went on an off afternoon because they were closing early for their holiday party or if the service and food is always this way. We were greeted and sat as soon as we walked in, but our server took quite a long time to get our drink and food order. He seemed very frustrated and busy. We both ordered the bruschetta and it took almost 40 minutes for it to get out to us. The entire inside of the restaurant had cleared out at this point because they were closing early so they did not have a ton of food orders to fill. After we hurry and ate (so we didn't keep the staff long since they were getting ready for their party) i could tell a huge difference in the presentation and taste of the bruscetta from the Phoenix location. It didn't seem as fresh, tasted off and looked like it was thrown together quickly so the toppings were everywhere. It just wasn't right. Big let down! Neither my husband nor I finished our plates and we asked for the check. That took about another 20 minutes. On top of that I had to ask for water 10 times and they kept forgetting. I think throughout the entire visit I had 2 refills, so I kept drinking my husbands water. Good thing he likes to share! After paying the tab by another server we were getting ready to walk out and our server finally came back around and passed us without speaking to us and mumbled \"this is fu*&ing bu%%$#it I hate this stupid place.\" We all have our bad days so I am not going to blame him for the service, at that point we confirmed he was having a bad day. I am more upset about the food quality then I am over our server having a rough day, we have all been there. I am hoping I just visited you guys on a bad day, but will probably drive down to phoenix to get my bruschetta fix."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Gilbert.  Great place to hang out with friends to drink wine and eat cheese.  Love the bruschettas.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"this place! Service is sometimes a bit slow, but the nature of the concept is not a fast paced environment. They are always busy, but friendly and the food is so yummy!

P.s. $5 wine at lunch, can't beat that!"}
{"text":"bruschetta is AMAZING! Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, smoked salmon, and Salami with pesto were my favorite. the chicken & mozzarella panini was great..."}
{"text":"I wanted to write this review as a contrast to my previous review of Vino de Sonoma a couple of weeks ago where I was complaining that the cheese and charcuterie board was $45.
We went to Postino East for lunch and ordered their butcher's board. Way more food, great tastes and variety and $15!
Also got a glass of San Genevese wine that was excellent and only $5! Service was great too.
None of these prices and items were any kind of special. Those are the prices every day."}
{"text":"I miss living by here. Great food and Wine! Been here a handful of times and have never changed my 5 star review. Great service here for always being extremely crowded. The wine is delicious, so many choices. The food is so fresh and delicious. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. I would recommend this place for the food, service, wine and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had a perfect evening here. The atmosphere, food, and wine were great. I will be coming back here again and bring more people with me."}
{"text":"Postino's is a favorite due to the atmosphere but the $20 wine and bruschetta board is the best deal around.  The only thing that you must do is get there before 8 p.m.  Even if you don't drink like someone in my party, you can enjoy anything from a salad, panini, soup and other munchie items!"}
{"text":"Back again for lunch on Sunday. Great service and Great food is all I can say!"}
{"text":"Went to Postino East on New Years eve with friend's for dinner. Overall, it's a pretty nice place and has a nice atmosphere. We were greeted immediately and seated outside by the fireplace. Very good wait service from the waiter. The food was good and presented very nicely. I had the tuna sandwich and chips and my wife had the turkey. The menu I felt was kind of limited, but did offer some interesting appetizers. My only complaint is that I thought the alcohol prices were kind of steep. My friend's wife had two half glasses of wine and for both it was $20. This restaurant fits nicely in the downtown Gilbert area which is becoming a go to place for a quick evening out."}
{"text":"Happy hour ends at 5pm???!!!!! Sad!

Wine and beer only.

Dog-friendly patio.

Wifi is DOWN!

Only two one-hole restrooms for a huge place. Prepare to wait!

Good service."}
{"text":"I planned a 50th birthday party for my wife at this location.  I needed catering and I was able to place an order with Catering Manager, Natalie with ease.  She advised me on portion size and with her help, I ordered just the right amount of food with minimal left overs.  I reserved a portion of the back yard area from 7 - 9 PM and we brought in home made desserts and party favors.  The on site staff provided a table and set up for us to decorate.  Our party ended up being about 27 and we stayed an extra hour with no issue.  Felix and the on site staff did a great job helping our party throughout the event.  The location and backyard area is charming and cool enough for a late September event.  I had to deal with many people within Postinos and came away impressed at every level.  They made it easy and the quality of food and service was excellent.  I really appreciated their effort and would recommend them unequivocally."}
{"text":"Lovely place in downtown old Gilbert. Nice menu and friendly staff. Wait times are low and indoor/outdoor options plenty. Main choices are Panini's, salads and bruschetta."}
{"text":"Postino is always a favorite for girls night! The mascato is my absolute favorite here, especially when it's $5. ;)

The gluten free bruschetta is to die for. In my opinion, way better than the regular bruschetta. The Brie/apple is a go to, and the seasonal fig jam is a must. Pesto and salmon too!

Great service and lovely food!"}
{"text":"Delicious Bruschettas, Great Wine & Beers and amazing customer service. Everyone here is very nice and helpful. I love the building and the area out back of the restaurant. Although I mostly come here to have drinks after work, I have eaten here a few times. The Bruschettas are all good and you get to pick 4 different ones. I have also been here for brunch. Great coffee and the I got the Yogurt, fruit and granola. It was very good and it's perfect if you're looking for a light breakfast on the weekend. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Postino
Overpriced and way overrated. I feel a lot like the American female gymnast Mckayla Maroney at the 2012 Olympic games (not impressed).

My friend and I shared many glasses of wine and two orders of the bruschetta boards. We chose all but two of the toppings they offer so we were both able to have a sampling of mostly everything they offer.

The ingredients sound somewhat expensive and I expected them to be delicious, but sadly they are not of great quality.(Brie, goat cheese, burrata, mascarpone, fig spread, prosciutto, smoked salmon) If the quality of the meats and cheeses was better, the rating would be much higher. Most of the bruschetta lacked flavor. Even the wine at our servers suggestion, who was awesome by the way; was not good quality either for the prices.Off the top of my head, Olive & Ivy at the Scottsdale waterfront has MUCH more flavorful bruschetta and an incredible wine selection. 

They were packed, so the wait was around 40 minutes on a Monday evening. The ambiance was nice for the area. Maybe a little out of place in an older more family oriented, historic part of town. It was a lively, younger professional crowd. 

One thing this place has going for it is the ambiance. There is a nice light chatter in the background and the decor is decent. It would be a perfect date spot if the food was better. When it cools down here in AZ, the large bay doors at the Gilbert location will give this place even greater ambiance when they are opened.

*Mondays and Tuesdays they have bruschetta and a bottle of wine after 8pm. That sounds like a much better deal than when I ate there."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! Postino is my favorite wine bar in the East Valley. 

The best nights to go are Monday and Tuesday nights to take advantage of their $20 house bottle of wine and board of bruschetta deal. The deal starts at 8pm but be prepared to wait about an hour for a table...it's definitely worth the wait! My favorite summer wine is the Biutiful Brut Rose which pairs well with the Brie & Apples with fig bruschetta. 

The atmosphere is so classy, the staff is knowledgeable about the wines and the patio is inviting! I will definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to Gilbert 5 years ago, Postino has always been my favorite and go to place for happy hour drinks, food and atmosphere...and now YOGA!! All my favorite worlds in one place on Sundays!! Brilliant!!"}
{"text":"Great spot in downtown Gilbert.  Had brunch here after the farmers market.  Great light eats.  They boast a huge variety of drinks, you will love it if you are into wine, tons of options and they typically have specials.  The outdoor seating was superb, by then it was March.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I would eat here everyday if I could. The bruschetta boards are fantastic. My favorite is the fig jam with Brie and apples. The atmosphere is really nice. It's upscale without being unapproachable. The service is consistent. Perfect for date night, girls night and all in between."}
{"text":"I just moved here from the San Francisco bay Area and have yet to find the unique eating places like there was at home... Ok I just found it.  Awesome.  I had the cheese plate and mother the meat plate.  Delicious.  They came out on wodden cutting boads and butcher blocks.  Staff was exceptional and I love when serve staff know their menu and can make suggestions.  Our waiter was awesome.  I want to try the Bruschetta next time. I just found my now go to place."}
{"text":"So this is my first time in Arizona and I'm visiting a friend and I have to say this is definitely a must hit spot! The bruschetta board is amazing definitely a must have! And the autostrada panini is amazing!"}
{"text":"MgThe only bad thing about Postinos is that everyone knows about them so they ate always buay.  Brunch is amazing.  The wine selection is good and unique. Best place for bruschetta in the valley."}
{"text":"Absolutely Classy! Loved the wine food and outdoor sitting. Wonderful staff as well!"}
{"text":"From bruschetta to paninis to wine, everything about Postino's is a good time! I have honestly never ordered anything here that I didn't like. They use the No Wait App and it's usually open for you to get in line before hand, so if you don't have that app, download it ASAP! It definitely comes in handy on Bottle and Board night (Monday & Tuesday after 8pm) and dinner rush."}
{"text":"After I left my first review of my first visit to Postino's I was highly disappointed but want to give an update. The management team of Postino's promptly responded to my negative review with humility and offered an apology with zero excuses. They also went out of their way and offered to have my husband and I back, if we accepted, on the house. I found that very professional because of the many fans they do have, my one negative review was not going to ruin their business, however, none of that seemed relevant to them and they wanted to make it right for all customers. My second visit was great, went with a girl-friend for some of their famous bruschetta, which we loved, and the service was great as well. I'm thankful for the management team of Postino's going out of their way to make it right for their customers, it shows what they really value most and how they want their business to be viewed as. I will definitely be back and appreciate the accommodations I've received from Postino's."}
{"text":"Great bruschettas. Love the tomato jam and their salads. On mon and Tuesday they have $20 bruschetta and wine which is a great deal. Only problem is that they are always busy"}
{"text":"We rolled up an hour before closing after attending a concert and they took great care of us.  Couple of beers and some wine.  We ordered the Brushetta board.  We liked that we each got to order one of the options and they cut each one so we could taste test.  I ordered the salmon.  Son-in-law ordered the artichoke, Daughter ordered the jelly and we ordered the tomato and mozzarella as our last option.  Yummy. We sat on the patio.  It was a beautiful night but unfortunately the area they sat us in was super dark.  When you have to hold the tea candle next to the menu to order it is too dark....just sayin."}
{"text":"we love this place.  the food is good. the wait staff is really good. it is a nice place to relax or if you want a quick bite to eat before a play at hale theatre.  the $5 wine special is great before 5 pm. we go there specifically for that on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Love the setting and food. Just wish isn't wasn't so popular (good problem for the owners), because it's very difficult to get a table."}
{"text":"Had the most awesome meal at Postinos today. Of course their food is good always.
From the time we entered till we left, everything was perfect. The service was amazing. Everyone was so nice & kind & looked happy & cheerful. They were always with a smile. Did I Say, The food was the very best as always. 
I love Postinos & it is my favorite place to go to for special occasions. But I had a bad experience 5 months ago & didn't want to go back. Glad I gave them another chance. Today they made up for it all. Will definitely be back to this location again soon.
Attention to detail surprised me. My Husband dropped his fork & I told him to wipe it & use it without worrying the servers. But one of the girls saw it & walked up to him with a fork, before he could even ask for it. 
Bobby our server was so cheerful & made everything so good for us. Jeff & Justice was so nice & spoke to us & asked if everything went well. The service at this place is much, much better than any place I have been to in awhile.
Keep up the good work guys. Good luck. We will be back soon.
It was our Wedding Anniversary & Thank you for making our Day special."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location since they opened. Before that I would drive to Scottsdale. Try the butcher's block and the different bruschettas split with someone."}
{"text":"I have only been here once and I still cannot stop thinking about how good the Bruschetta was. If you haven't tried the salmon please do! It was amazing. The service was awesome, really laid back place to be to talk over some good drinks and quick bites. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"BOMB DOT COM!!!! 

LOVE this place and the atmosphere. Be sure to try the bruschetta!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot in Gilbert. Brunch, lunch, dinner, HH... Always have enjoyed the food, drinks, and service. 

Has a good (small, but varied) beer selection for a place that's predominantly a wine bar, and the bruschetta's are all amazing. Fig and Green Apple all the way!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to grab a glass of wine (Holly's way Chardonnay) and some bruschetta. The options are all fabulous. I also enjoy the salads and soup combos. Each day the soups can be different and every one is always so crafty and has top notch taste. Every time I'm in AZ visiting family this is on my MUST list."}
{"text":"There for the 1st time on a Monday evening.  Restaurant looks great and the food was terrific.  It's great to have a Postino location in the East Valley."}
{"text":"We just experienced a small issue with our food- but Justice - the manager on duty- went above and beyond to make it right with us! We enjoyed a lovely time outside with excellent service from Kristen! We love the atmosphere at Postinos and it's a perfect spot after attending a show next door ...Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Can you ever go wrong with Postinos??? I've had the pleasure of going to several of their locations and alway enjoy it - especially among friends. 

The Gilbert location is great. There's a lot of places to visit in the area and Dierks Bentley Whisky Row is just across the way! So a great place to end the night!!

Head out on a $20 Bottle and Board night and enjoy among friends or on a date! Have been here several times and really enjoyed it. Pick along four of their many bruschetta boards and enjoy a bottle of wine along side it. We've enjoyed dinner here too and all but the food is great. 

The place is trendy and the staff has always been friendly at all the locations I've been too. It's often, hip and the patio is nice. 

I've had the extreme pleasure to meet Lauren, one of the owners and found she is a fantastic person. Our meeting was brief but really enjoyed the meal we had and taking about her business and background. I remember she told me to find your I can't wait for Monday job, which she definitely has done with this place. 

Love Postinos and everything about it. All the locations are in trendy areas with modern settings. It's perfect for a night out with the friends or a date night with your significant other. You can't go wrong with be $20 bottle and board nights!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything I've had here is good. The staff is friendly and attentive. The only problem is that there is usually a wait, no matter when you go. But, it is totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Hip and happening has come to Gilbert. Great wine and interesting dishes. Nice place to hang out on a week night - packed on Friday and Saturday though"}
{"text":"Service was ok. Not perfect. Our server Adam was fantastic. Lots of different people coming and going from our table. Not too long of a wait. Sat at the bar and had Bella Postino appetizer!! Yummy:) the half sandwich and salad was the best deal for $10"}
{"text":"OMG the bruschetta is to die for the wine is amazing. Ambience is wonderful a absolute must for a girlfriend lunch out. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Postino is always great.  The central location catered my wedding three years ago, the 44th Street location is always a good time, so when I moved to the east valley, I of course had to check out \"Postino East.\"

The bruschetta board is ever-raising in price... but that's okay because I get a meal for two out of it - regardless of the cost.  :)

I really would just like to say there is a GORGEOUS bartender there so all you single ladies... get in line at the bar and tip him well.  (Don't know his name, when he works, or a damn thing about him.  He has a beard.)

Service was great from our waiter (time 1) and waitress (time 2) as always.

Looking forward to more brunches with friends and continuing the Postino tradition."}
{"text":"I have to say I've always been a huge postinos fan but this last experience really ruined it for me. Our server McKenna seemed like she really didn't know our table existed, which is strange because we had a big group. We waited forever just to order drinks, even longer to get them which none were brought by her so it was a game of guess who when other people came to the table as they all arrived one at a time.

It took asking THREE people and for a manger if we could order our food for her to finally come over and ask if we were ready, because sitting blankly for over 20 minutes wasn't obvious enough. Upon finishing our food on tiny couch tables our plates sat stacked up and again after a long period of time she then shows up with checks. We were Not only not offered dessert which was really annoying considering we were there for a birthday but once she brought our checks she left the table one at a time to run them, Again with the horrible service. She finally asked if we wanted a birthday dessert but after hitting the 2 hour mark half our party had left.

Very disappointing when we could have chose any restaurant in the area and maybe gotten decent service."}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks and noshing...

Now if the other people in front of me in line would just go away...."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of their bruschetta, very unique that they put ingredients other than the boring old tomatoes on top.  They have a lot of different wines and craft beers.  There is also a really good happy hour which is good for celebrations with a group.  It gets pretty crowded at dinner time.  The sandwiches are huge in portion and salads are very tasty.  It was the first place my boyfriend took me to when I was visiting in AZ so I guess it also has some sentimental value.  The atmosphere is really romantic and really good for date night, the noise level is moderate so you don't have to shout across the table trying to talk to each other.  The breakfast food is not too bad either, pretty healthy balanced breakfast.  I just love the decor and feel of the place.  There are huge garage like doors that open up to the outside patio.  The staff are also very attentive and nice.  

What to order:
Bruschetta - my favorites include brie and apple, warm creamy artichoke, prosciutto and figs
Paninis - roast beef"}
{"text":"Love the Pub Board cheese and charcuterie board. The MJ soft pretzel with mustard is amazing as well as all the accoutrements. I have had the Butcher's Block as well, but prefer the Pub Board for the pretzel, something about it....Just as amazing are the bruschetta boards where you choose your own 4 flavors.

I don't drink so I cannot comment on the alcoholic beverages but I have never felt out of place dining here without drinking wine or beer.

The wait can be very long here, even if you are eating at the bar. This is not a large restaurant so seating is limited. If you are a new transplant to the Phoenix area, make Postino's one of the restaurants you must try."}
{"text":"Not only was the service impeccable and the atmosphere ideal, but the food was beyond amazing.

I arrived there with three others, and we were immediately greeted by one of their many amazing servers. We wanted a patio table since it was so nice out, but were told we would have to wait until one was available...which was perfectly fine. We were then asked for our drink order, and were served some amazing $5 glasses of wine (for happy hour) right away. We were quite impressed, because everyone was so willing to help us while we were waiting on our table. We were probably asked from 4 different servers if they could get us anything.

We were then seated on the patio, and ordered several orders of bruschetta, which is the best I've ever had. The four of us shared two orders, and were beyond stuffed, yet felt compelled to order the hummus and artichoke dips. To die for as well.

All in all, it was a great experience, and even though I am not a Phoenix area native, I will be back for more. Bravo."}
{"text":"I never am in the Gilbert area but met my son for lunch at his work. He wanted to go to downtown Gilbert and we ended up at Postino. I'm always game for Postino's. It's all about their Bruschetta board. 

We found parking about a block away which was very convenient. Walk in and this place is so airy and open. Love the ambiance very bright. We got a table by the bookshelves and the bar. Very loud. 

We ordered the Bruschetta board with Brie & Apple, Warm Artichoke spread, Smoked Salmon, & Ricotta with Dates and Pistachios. They are all good but my favorite is the Brie and Apple. Second fav was the Ricotta with dates & Pistachios. Loved the sweetness of the dates with the crunchiness of the Pistachios. Only problem is the kitchen was slow and brought out Bruschetta board after our meal. 

For my lunch I ordered the half and half. Got the prosciutto with Brie sandwich and a Brussel sprout salad. Loved the prosciutto sandwich. Really good. I just loved it. The Brussel Sprouts Salad is just so good. I really love Brussel Sprouts and this salad really hit the spot. 

The service was really good. Our server greeted us right away and got us our drinks. He kept on filling our water cups which was really good. He checked on us and even apologize a couple of time to us because the Bruschetta board came after of lunch. He basically said he put the Bruschetta order in first but the kitchen was behind today. It really didn't matter to us as long as our board came. 

I tell you what. Postino's kept its reputation. Good food. Great Bruschetta board. Fresh and delicious. Really good service and do understand the kitchen getting swamped. Everyone wants a board. It's what they're know for. Plus a great ambiance with that open air feeling. Loud but a fun place. Little different vibe than the Tempe one but just as good. 

Enjoy we sure did."}
{"text":"It was just two of us for a nice quite lunch and that's just what we got. 

Service was friendly and very helpful. Several different people stopped by to help decide on what to get, refill drink and bring out food. Loved that they all seemed to work as a team and care about all the tables. 

We ordered a pitcher of beer ($5 if before 5pm and will fill about 2.5 glasses) and bruschetta. Beer was the Four Peaks SunBru Kolsch Style Ale, which was recommended to us by the waitress. Nice light flavor on a hot summer day.

Today we got the Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, which was amazing. Little salty, little sweet with a nice bread to hold it. The Smoked Salmon with Pesto, which was our favorite. Had some capers on the top with a really light cream inside that I'm not totally sure what it was. The fish was fresh and just a great couple bites. Next was the Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato. I'd never had burrata before but it was so creamy. A perfect match with the acidity of the tomato, salt of the bacon and freshness of the arugula. Very nice combination. Last was Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. I'm a big goat cheese fan and roasted red peppers. Nothing that's out of this world but still a great combo. 

I think this would be a great place to go if you've got a business meeting or just want to have a quiet meal out. For two people it was $20 and in my book, that's a great deal for some really good food and drink."}
{"text":"I have been to Postinos quiet a few times and I have to say I'm kind of sick of it. The rude staff, the food that always gives me a tummy ache and the annoying 45 minute wait every time even when I see tables. 

My best friend and I went last night and both of us woke up this morning with upset stomachs.

I just don't think I'll be back- I don't get the appeal anymore. Even though I know I'm clearly in the minority."}
{"text":"After hearing good things about this place for years my wife and I finally decided to try Postino's. We went on a Monday evening just after happy hour, and were seated quickly.  

We were asked almost immediately if we were ready to order, but having never been to the restaurant before it took us a while to decide on what we wanted. I have to say, the service bordered on overly-attentive; they seemed to be working as a team, because every few minutes a different young lady came around checking in on us --and sometimes asking the exact same question as the waitperson before her. If they are going to be using this style of service they could communicate with each other better, so diner's aren't left feeling like they are characters in Groundhog's Day.

On to the food -- we ordered: 1 half roast beef panini, 1 Italian picnic salad, and of course, bruschetta.  My wife enjoyed her salad once she was managed to pick out the beets, there was just too many of them. She thought the bruschetta, through beautifully presented, was just not crispy enough. We tried the following four types: Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil, Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes, Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese, & Salami with Pesto.  My fav was the classic Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil.  My wife's was the Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese, but we weren't fighting over who got the last slice of any of them. 

They seem to have an awesome happy hour special (Monday & Tuesday nights), $20 for a bottle of wine (though, I am uncertain of their selection for this deal) and a bruschetta platter.  The platter by itself is $13 so that's a good deal.  

I can see why this is a popular 'girls night out' option, and it does seem to be targeted towards a younger crowd (like us), which is refreshing in a family-focused town like Gilbert. We'll be back with wine loving friends but Postino's won't be brought in to our line up of regular dinner options."}
{"text":"This is only of our favorite places to go to enjoy a few bruschetta boards, glasses of wine and pitchers of beer. The service is always great and we haven't had a bad dish yet. The best time to go is around 2 p.m. on the weekends, after the lunch rush and before $5 happy hour ends. The outdoor space is great for bringing our dog with us, which is also a huge plus for places we dine. The only down side to Postino is how loud the inside of the restaurant is. It's really hard to have a conversation inside."}
{"text":"Great place for wine and delicious food. The bruschetta is a must have every time I go. Want to have a nice dinner with a cool ambiance go to this place."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is a very good word to describe my experience with Postino East. The wait time we were given was 20 minutes - which turned into 50 minutes. We were given really awkward seating - a couch that was shared with a couple (it could have been detached, I'm not sure why they insisted on pushing everything together). 

There were flies EVERYWHERE. Hang bags of water above doorways - flies won't go under anywhere they can sense water above them. Or let them crawl all over the food, as Postino seems to prefer.

The food was okay. It was very affordable though. The waitstaff is also very nice and polite, and despite the busyness of the morning, prompt.

I'm not sure why they chose to have way more outdoor seating than indoor seating in a city that's unbearably hot for a good part of the year. Seems like a waste of space to me.

Overall I'd like to visit for dinner or lunch. The food is affordable and well-made, but their handling of crowds can definitely be improved."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Great food and wine selection. Good choice of seasonal options. It is a tavern so the selection is a bit limited to the bruchetta. The WiFi is spot on and free. I would recommend a sweet Spanish Azul or a dry monastrell. For something in the middle the Pecina. The smoked salmon has to be the best bruchetta. I would like to try the sandwich or soups next time. Over all a great place to meet people. There were plenty of couples or first timers here that made the atmosphere slighty different. This is a down-town Gilbert must to try. Second attempt, I'll add the music is between contemporary synth-pop and 80's which I actually enjoyed greatly. 

My only complaint was that the changing lights on the street can be distracting. I also dislike patios that drench you in misters. But I understand that is a Arizona thing."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. It is a place that you can just relax and enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant.  This is some place worth visiting if you have not already."}
{"text":"Postino postino postino. A top contender for my favorite spot in Gilbert. We came here for Sunday Funday (3/30) An awesome time. Killer Bruschetta. Killer Paninis. And killer wine and beer specials. Sunshine. Great live music! A perfect day. Kayla was our girl and she was awesome. She had excellent recommendations for us. We will most definitely be back because of her. 
Do not let her go!"}
{"text":"I came here last night for the first time and fell in love!!  Waited a little over an hour for a table but it was so worth it.  I love bruschetta in the first place but Postinos took the word bruschetta to a whole new level!!  I ordered the platter where you could pick 4 different kinds of bruschetta and chose the white bean and tomato, tomato mozzarella and basil, goat cheese and red pepper, and prosciutto fig and mascarpone.  All four of them were to die for!! I also ordered the nine iron panini with chips and it was the most delicious panini I have ever ordered from a restaurant!! I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!! I will definitely return for more :)"}
{"text":"Prosciutto with brie on focaccia, a glass of Riesling, with the Foo Fighters playing on the speakers overhead.  


Happy."}
{"text":"Always first class!  The red pepper and goat cheese bruschetta,  fresh chicken salad, pesto turkey panini, artichoke appetizer and the BEST dessert wine Moscato.  Always great food and service.  The atmosphere is perfect for a date night or girls night out.  I brought my baby last night and he was messy and fussy, yet the staff took great care."}
{"text":"Came in here on a random Wednesday afternoon, I am a huge fan of Joyride next door so I checked this place out. The ambiance is great, the staff was friendly to begin with but seemed as if they lost interest once myself and my friend decided against alcohol this particular meal. After we told them we were just having water, the frequency at which our table was visited slowed considerably. We were ordering a few different appetizers and some sandwiches and overall I just wasn't impressed really. The I had a chipotle chicken sandwich on focaccia, and the it was a bit hard. Just overall I didn't have a good experience here. I will be sticking to Joyride."}
{"text":"This is going to be my first Postino Visit not counting Windsor or Churn. I rarely get into Gilbert for work but this downtown area has some good stuff all around like Joe's BBQ, Liberty Market, The Farmhouse Restaurant. Everyone here was pretty cool.

I had the vegetarian white bean hummus with cucumbers, yellow heirloom tomatoes, olives, greens, tomatoes with an artichoke secret sauce.$10. Loved the meal. HH in this wine bar of course brings $5 glasses of vino. I ordered a California Pinot Noir. 

I rarely sit on the patio but this place has a beautiful outside area and open air seating. I absolutely love the towering Gilbert Water Tank, giving up a great rural feeling. Good bye, city life. Something else here is the large grassy area. Plug some fast growing mesquite trees and the yard will be all that.

I am going to have to give the Central Ave Postino's a try, in the old Katz's Deli building and reminisce over the $2. egg plates."}
{"text":"I was skeptical given I pretty much hate food like this, laden with veggies, but we were invited by some good friends, so I played the part of the good sport. Fortunately, our table had the good sense to order nearly everything on the menu and share. It was everyone's first time at the table so it gave everyone a chance to try a little bit of everything.

We started with the Bella Postino. If I'm being honest, I thought the bread was a little disappointing in terms of quality as well as quantity. We had to ask for more in order to finish the dips. The table did not finish the hummus which I took as a sign that everyone thought it was as boring as I did. While I did not try the artichoke dip, it was easily polished off, a clear thumbs up from the table. I normally go for artichoke dip, but this one was extremely chunky. Seemed more like giants pieces of artichoke and nothing like a dip for me. I prefer a nice smooth creamy/cheesy dip with occasional chunks.

Next we blitzed the menu. We ordered all but 3 of the bruschetta's (left off the seasonal, ricotta with dates & pistachios, and white bean with chopped tomato). We ordered the soup of the day (red pepper gouda), and we ordered a few panini's. I had the Nine Iron, but on the recommendation of our server, swapped the dijonnaise for the spicy sun-dried tomato mayo from the chicken & mozzarella panini. Good call by the server because the mayo MADE the panini. It was excellent. Not too spicy, just a mild kick that really gave the panini a flavor worth coming back for more bites when you had a table full of bruschetta. The other panini ordered at the table was the turkey which also had great reviews from the table. Everyone enjoyed the red pepper gouda soup. Hell, I hate red peppers, but the soup was awesome. I could have had a giant bowl of the soup and some soft warm bread and been completely happy with my visit. Here is a list of favorite bruschetta's at our table in no particular order:

-Brie & apples with fig spread
-Tomato jam & fresh sheeps milk cheese
-Burrata, bacon, arugula & tomato
-Roasted red peppers with goat cheese
-Salami & pest

That said, the first one was so sweet, it could have been ordered as a dessert. Seriously. We mentioned that to the server and she told us that some people do order it as a dessert.

Now, I almost never order dessert at a restaurant because I generally feel like I'll get a better dessert at a place that only makes sweets like an ice cream shop or a bakery. However, we ordered 3 of the 4 desserts on their menu. Everything but the affogato. The creme brulee was good, but really lacked the fresh fruit that I think makes a brulee great. The chocolate bouchon was a fancy name for lava cake. I'm not big on these lava cakes in general and this one didn't exceed my expectations. Extreme chocolate flavor, but nothing special here to make it stand out over any other lava cake. The salted caramel sundae was the star of the show. Easily the table favorite. The caramel was amazing. The chocolate covered corn nuts were a sweet & salty stroke of genius and they were subsequently rationed to ensure fair distribution at the table. A few of us agreed that we could see ourselves coming back just to order dessert in the future. I only wished I had a Gene Simmons tongue so I could have licked the sundae completely clean along with the shot glass of salted caramel.

Overall, this place was very good. It had something for everyone at our table. It even pleased my picky palate."}
{"text":"This is only of my favorte places to go in gilbert. really yummy food and a great staff! There is not one bad kind of the bruschetta! My favorite is the prosciutto and fig. mmmmmm so good. They have a great happy hour but it ends at 5 :( but you get mini pitchers (probably 2.5 pints) for 5 dollars and they have a great beer selection. The tomato and moz app is amazing! The only fall back is there is no reservations unless you are in a large party and there is usually a pretty long wait (30 minutes) on the weekend. But if you can handle a little waiting time you will love it."}
{"text":"Amazing bruschetta and \"Butcher's block,\" which is basically Postino's version of a charcuterie board.  Very well done and ample portions, as well as the wine selection which was just enough to make me feel like somewhat of an enthusiast, but not too much so as to intimidate the casual drinker. Very cool place, although they could use a bit more extensive menu as well as turn up the lights just a LITTLE.  We will be back."}
{"text":"One of my fav place to go with my girlfriends! I used to drive to the one in Phoenix as well but of obviously it made more sense to the one that's closer to me! Love all the Bruschetta options, the wine and even their desserts! The staffs are great and love the place itself!!! My girlfriends and I always have a great time!!!"}
{"text":"Mon&Tues special keeps us coming back all the time. Bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20....you can't beat that! I've never been disappointed with the food and service here."}
{"text":"A break from Southwest tradition, Postinos offers an excellent menu full of wonderful salads, sandwiches, and a great wine menu.  If you arrive before five, you get a deal on the drinks, if not you belong with the outdoor dining area under the stars."}
{"text":"This place is great! This place is always busy, but not in a bad way. Its a buzzing, positive vibe and everyone seems to be really enjoying themselves. Oddly enough out of the 5-10 times I have been here I have not once been inside!! I always sit on the patio, which is really comfortable. The food is AMAZING and the drinks are awesome too. I love the happy hour deals and I love how nice the servers are. I have never had a bad experience here. I could eat here every day and never get tired of it."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant hands down. I go here two to three times a month, for their Monday Tuesday deal. The bruschetta is incredible, at first I was weary of the pairings but I have never been disappointed. I came here on a first date with a very picky eater, now we have been dating for 6 months and it's our go to place since we both love it. The Moscato is perfect, and I always make my boyfriend drive so I can guzzle it down. My only qualm is the fact that servers are not assigned sections, so there has been a time or two and I have been forgotten for over 20 minutes while they attended to someone else, thinking I had already been helped. Overall the atmosphere, staff, food, and wine all make this a wonderful experience. I highly recommend for anyone and everyone. Even my mom loves it, and she is the least adventurous eater ever. Plus they have gluten free options for her!"}
{"text":"Ahh...Postino. This place is perfect if you're looking for a light dinner and a glass of wine. I've been here on several occasions and always seem to have the bruschetta...but who doesn't? Great place for a date or girls night. If you live in Gilbert, Mesa, or Chandler, Postino is definitely a place to be.

Overall, head to Postino for the perfect glass of wine and bruschetta."}
{"text":"While Postino is not my favorite food place, their customer service is outstanding. Two friends and I arrived at 4:15 on a Friday night requesting an inside table. The hostess quoted a 30 minute wait. After about 40 minutes, the manager, Justice, approached us apologizing that it was taking longer. He told us he would comp some bruschetta for us. We ended up waiting another 30 minutes and he also covered a bottle of wine for us. While the wait was a bit long, they more than made up for the wait and I will return."}
{"text":"We liked this place.  We went Sunday Morning after church and although busy they seated us quickly and service was friendly and prompt.  Food quality was above average and costs were as expected. Atmosphere was fund and friendly.  Recommend"}
{"text":"I love Postino's.  I am slightly biased because my husband proposed to me here, but the reason he did so was because we went on our first real date to Postino's (Arcadia) and had such a wonderful time.  You really can't beat the bottle and board specials.  And their bruschetta is still the best- other wine bars in the valley just can't compete with it! The tomato jam is amazing!  Only downside is it's always paaacked with people and often a long wait.  Very good service- water always full!"}
{"text":"We didn't want to stand around and wait like they told us we would have to today which is a Saturday night. So I called ahead and they wouldn't take our reservation. What they want is for you to have drinks and spend more money waiting for your table. I told him no thank you and make sure you tell the boss that we don't really like being manipulated."}
{"text":"I love the wine & bruschetta deal Monday and Tuesday nights. I'm a huge fan of the bruschetta and I think the deal is perfect for one person (haha...but seriously, it's enough food to be satisfying). I adore the goat cheese & red pepper bruschetta, and the pistachio bruschetta is fabulous. I find plenty of yummy vegetarian options easily.

The pitcher of beer for $5 is only about 2.25 pints, so don't get too excited. It's still obviously a good price for good craft draft beers."}
{"text":"This is exactly what Gilbert needs! Love this place. Love everything about it: location, service, food, vibe. It is really cute and has comfortable seating outside and inside. There is a grass area where you can bring a blanket and eat your food there. There is always a wait, but they take such great care of you. They brought us out some tasty olives while we sat around and sipped on bellinis. The bruschetta is amazing. Then I had the roast beef sandwich and Italian salad, which blew my mind. Sitting on a comfy cough, sippin on some beverages, and biting into some crispy bread loaded with salmon, figs, pesto, and sun dried tomatoes. Close to heaven as you can get on Earth."}
{"text":"This place is perfection! The relaxed atmosphere, casual but hip ambiance and delicious food are all just a few reasons to love this location. The staff is always pleasant and entertaining as well, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We got in early on a Monday evening and got seated right away on the patio. Weather was perfect. We had a nice waitress,  Katelyn that was pleasant and attentive. The Bruschetta appetizers were very good as well as our pizza's. My husband had the Quattro Stagioni and I had the Ortolana. We will definitely return to try out some other menu items."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the ambiance and bruschetta!! I came here for a surprise bday dinner with my classmates. My friends recommended eating prior since its a little on the pricier side. I ordered the four of the following bruschetta:

Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone
Smoked Salmon with Pesto
Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese (**FAVE**)
Salami with Pesto

I'm starting a healthier lifestyle by trying to eat organic, more veges, and foods with anti-oxidants. Today was a cheat day and I will have to remind myself that this is a great place to come back to! There were about 20 of us and we sat in nice comfy chairs outside. Waiter was really friendly -- great service! I love the ambiance and its a great place to walk around downtown Gilbert afterwards!"}
{"text":"My group of 12 celebrated my birthday at Postino's in downtown gilbert yesterday.  We had an amazing time.  I chose Postino's for my birthday celebration because it has an incredible vibe, great wine and the wait staff is always friendly and excellent.   We ordered some food yesterday which was also amazing.   We had some bruschetta on cucumber and beef steak tomatoes (instead of on bread.) So good.   Highly recommended Postino's...my favorite place!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I think it's a great place to meet up with friends and family. The open concept is just the right touch for this type of restaurant. The only down side is that I think the location is to small for the type of success they are having
My favorite part about going there is taste the wine and beer they have on tap and the season bruschetta.
The attention is A+ 
The perfect place for a first date"}
{"text":"The hostess is why I'll never come here again. 

The food is good, but we waited two hours.. Granted it was busy because of their board and bottle deal and we were a big party of 7. The app did not properly predict when a table would be ready. And they sat us at a table really meant for 6, which wouldn't have bother me if weren't for party of 5 waiting for their check at a table meant for 8.

Mistakes happen, but I'm writing this review because the hostess tried to play dumb (rather poorly too). She didn't acknowledge her error- when we brought it to her attention. Gladly our waiter and the manager did and gave us A VERY SMALL  discount. 

Warning to future customers: it's  better to wait in the front than in the back at that space, they call the yard. Where the hostess can't see you and is able to give your table away easily."}
{"text":"I love LOVE lOvE Postinos! Its such a great spot to go for any occasion with or without kids.  I like the setup of the restaurant being half indoors and half out but its really a great seat no matter where you sit or no matter the weather.  The food is absolutely delicious and I cant get enough of the cucumber lemonade. I just melt!"}
{"text":"One of my fav places in Gilbert. Great food,  good atmosphere and awesome patio. The best is their bruschetta boards!! They also have great brunch on Sat & Sun. Definitely a place worth checking out."}
{"text":"I give it for because they have an amazing wine selection! But they need to work on their portions it's bad when you order pricy food and then go home and cook... It's good food just more for presentation not dining. The wait is pretty long most of the time it's just expected for this place."}
{"text":"Friendly service (except for the hostesses who were snooty).  This is definitely the place for people who want to feel \"in\" and trendy for no reason at all.  This is not a place you bring a big appetite to."}
{"text":"I just love their food and atmosphere. Hipster, great music and service. One of my favorite go-to places in town."}
{"text":"Thank You!!! Thank You !! 
A beautiful wine cafe finally here in Gilbert.  The space has beautifully contemporary design and the food and wine are fantastic.  If you are anywhere remotely close to Gilbert, It is a must see!!   They have an eclectic wine list and have great bruschetta boards with an array of different bruschettas to chose from, they also serve gourmet sandwiches.  Monday and Tuesday they have a special when you purchase a bottle you receive a free Bruschetta board GRATIS!!!!  Really!!!  
 Nestled in the Old Town (downtown) part of Gilbert, there is a lot going on here with great local owned shops and restaurants!!  Just across the street on Saturdays they have the Gilbert Farmers Market.   So shop around and pop in for a little vino!!!  Spread the Word!!! Postinos in Gilbert!!  Yes!!! It is True!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent excellent service!!!   5 star it's not enough for this place, great wines, food was amazing, really nice cozy place. We had such a fantastic time there. Highly recommend this place.  Thanks for the excellent service. Especial thanks to our waitress James!!"}
{"text":"I have never liked traditional cold bruscetta but the boards here are AMAZING!! So much so that's Its my all time favorite place. I'm happy living in this desert w Postino's ten min away."}
{"text":"A new resident to Gilbert...particularly across the street from Postino's.  I walk by the spot everyday, and have watched the transformation for the last half year.
Finally, finally got to spend Easter Lunch there with some friends.  Completely worth the wait.
We were seated quickly and the staff pampered us.  They even allowed my little 2 pound dog to join in the festivities.
We chose all of our servers suggestions and he was spot on.
I look forward to growing my relationship with this place.
Would not change a single thing...oh, and btw, the music is perfect and fun."}
{"text":"Brought the family here for Mother's Day and won't make that mistake again.  Our waitress took our order and disappeared for an hour, I had to go chase someone down to find out where our food was. It's now been over an hour and a half and we're still sitting here with no food. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"The variety of bruschetta was excellent! I also enjoyed the fact that they had some local beers on tap. However, the PRICES... do not align with the quality or quantity of the food and drinks. Our tab consisted of: 1 Bruschetta, 2 beers and 2 glasses of wine. This came out to almost $60 with tip."}
{"text":"I love Postinos and have been a fan for many years and visited all of the locations throughout the valley.  I love the food as much as the vibe was thrilled when they moved into Downtown Gilbert.  They have been supportive and involved in our community and I wanted to thank them for supporting Gilbert Leadership, our Town and providing us an incredible lunch last week. Cheers Gilbert!"}
{"text":"After apx. 43 visits to Postino East, I believe I have a handle on their menu and wine list, but... I sure wish there was an app for the Poblano Corn Soup! Its to die for, can I get a bucket of that to go?"}
{"text":"We went last night about an hour before closing and enjoyed our night a lot. We ordered several different types of bruschetta and each one was delicious! We were seated outside by a heater and our waiter was so patient with our requests to turn up the heater, turn down the heater, and eventually move us inside. Great food, great atmosphere, great service."}
{"text":"OMGoodness simply beautiful atmosphere. Food is delicious wine selection is great and staff is friendly"}
{"text":"The food here is really good.  Service is great.  Love the atmosphere. Dog friendly on the patio. The ONLY reason this gets 4 stars is that when you eat inside, the music is really loud.   We asked the server to turn it down  a little.  She came back and said the manager would not turn down the music as he wanted \"to attract a certain demographic\", i.e. a younger crowd.  It was Sunday brunch.  Most all of the customers were over 40. We all had to yell across the table to hear each other.  When the people on either side of us heard us asking them to turn down the music, they thanked us. As we were finishing our meal, the table next to us said they would not be back and that there are too many places for breakfast nearby that would appreciate their service and would be quieter.  Apparently his tactics are not working.  I will eat there in the winter when I don't have to eat inside.  The manager's attitude was very arrogant.  He did not even bother to come over to the table to talk to us.  The server was great.  She also said she often gets complaints on the music but there was nothing she could do.  Not her fault."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants. However, we just celebrated my birthday there and were very disappointed with the service. We had reserved an indoor space because of a medical issue I have and were assured we would be inside. Instead, they gave our table to someone else and we were seated outside in 100 degree temps. We asked twice for a pitcher of water for the table since it was so hot and we were constantly needing refills. Both times we were told no problem, yet the pitchers were never brought. We asked one more time and were told they weren't allowed to leave pitchers at the table. So they can leave a pitcher of beer, but not a pitcher of water? Did I mention 100 degree temp? It took awhile before anyone took our drink order. Then another while before anyone took our food order. We had a hard time flagging down our server, even when one of the people in our party had an allergic reaction (heads up: their pesto contains walnuts). Thankfully one of the other guests in our party happened to have a Benadryl. It's like we were an invisible table because the smaller tables immediately next to us seemed to have decent service. 

Will I go back? Yes, because the food is delicious, but I will never again use it as a venue for a group setting. Too bad my most disappointing experience had to be for my birthday."}
{"text":"I have never been a wine drinker but i totally am now thanks to this place!! reasonably priced by the glass you can try anything before you bye it. The staff is incredibly knowledgeable and friendly this is not a snobby joint. I highly reccomend the bruschetta they have some great combinations. The cucumber lemonade is absolutely delicious. The atmosphere is suprisingly intamate but also great for a group!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for date night! Bruschetta is awesome! I wish they had wine flights, but maybe one day...."}
{"text":"For many Gilbert residents, Postinos is the local equivalent to Boston's \"Cheers\"...a friendly pace where everybody knows your name, and the drinks are poured with a smile. The staff has genuine charisma, and the brunch is to die for (you haven't LIVED until you've indulged in mimosas and French toast--if today was my last day, I would eat that French toast three TIMES.) The ambience is sexy enough for an intimate, romantic date night, but it's also cheerful, fun, and open enough for a business lunch or a girls night out. Try Postinos for yourself today, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try their bruschetta for a while now. Got a chance to go today, yay. Although the food was excellent, the service was subpar, that is why I only gave it 3 stars. From all the reviews, I thought I would be getting great food along with great service. Since it was my first time here, I don't know if it was just a fluke or not. Anyway, I felt like we were being ignored and the server just didn't seem very friendly.

The cucumber honey lemonade was not as tasty as I thought it would be. The lemonade tasted like it was made from concentrated lemon juice. Not good. Just stick to the teas lol. 

We ordered the Bella Postino, which came with artichoke dip and white bean hummus. The hummus was amazing. We also got the roast beef panini which was ok, nothing to brag about. 

My favorite type of bruschetta was the salami and the smoked salmon. Will be back for those! Yum.

Overall:

Food, 5 stars
Service, 2 stars."}
{"text":"Went last night to take my wife out for our first anniversary. We love fine meats, cheeses and a great atmosphere. I don't know if we are not hip enough or we smelled funny but we were ignored and treats as if we were second class. After waiting 30 minutes to even get a drink we had to leave, not because we were hungry but because we were ignored and when they finally came to get out order they started taking it then without cause left and didn't come back for 15 more minutes. It was insulting and a waste 50 minutes of our life. If your not a hipster, and I thought I was, don't waste your time. Plenty of places that care more in D-town Gilbert."}
{"text":"Great place. I was expecting a full Italian dinner selection, but it was Panini's and appetizers. Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"My cousin and I have been talking about coming here for months! She asked me where I wanted to go for a late birthday lunch, we both decided Postinos! 

We orders the bruschetta of course. The salmon, salami, mozzarella and tomato and the pecans?? The last one wasn't my favorite. We also ordered a roast beef sandwich with a side of salad and hummus for an appetizer. It was a lot of food for just us two!  My favorite was the salmon bruschetta, the favor just melted in my mouth. I ordered the \"fresh squeezed lemonade\" it was not fresh, I could taste the high fructose corn syrup in it! I asked to change it for a cucumber drink. And that didn't hit the spot either! I just stuck with water. 

Overall, I thought the food was good and would come back again for another meal. The customer service definitely needs some work. It was a busy Monday morning when we went and there was only one waitress attending to full tables in the restaurant. It took her about 5-7 minutes to come back to give a what we were waiting for."}
{"text":"Main Points:
-Great Happy Hour for drinks
-Cool trendy restaurant setting

Review:
I am so happy Gilbert has welcomed great places like Postino that we would have otherwise had to go all the way to Scottsdale to visit! It has a fun atmosphere and is a great spot to get together with friends and enjoy some food and drinks.

It's been said in previous reviews, but the $5 wine by the glass or pitchers of beer are a great deal if you stop in between 11am-5pm, 7 days a week.  On my last trip there they had Firestone Walker Pilsner on tap, and I haven't come across too many local places that carry Firestone's beer (I heart their 805!).  Postino's $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine deal is also perfect for any occasion, my favorite bruschetta of the moment is the Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone!

Go eat at Postino...nuff said!"}
{"text":"Great Food, great Wine selection, friendly service, fun atmosphere!!   Will return for sure.   My only suggestion would be have a DD or take a taxi as Gilbert police hate \"anyone\" that drinks any amount and they will invent reasons to pull you over."}
{"text":"I've heard this place get dumped on for being too hipster, but I absolutely love the ambiance. If I'm going out to eat I want great food and atmosphere. The selection of beers and wine is great, and they have delicious mimosas and bellinis! My favorite thing here is the bruschetta. They have really good happy hour type deals. Great place to go with a small group to enjoy drinks and shareable eats."}
{"text":"I come here solely for the bruschettas and nothing else!!

August 20th, my birthday, was the second time i've been to this location I came here for birthday lunch in the middle of my workday.  I went to the Arcadia location on the 18th to celebrate my birthday with friends.  The bread here at the Gilbert location was muchhhhh better  the Arcadia's bread was holey and hard!

did i say how much i love the bruschettas? oh i DO!!  My favorites include: Prosciutto and figs, apple, brie and figs, Tomato Jam and Sheep cheese.. i usually get all three and try a new one for the fourth choice. Ricotta and dates are good, on some days.. 

I prefer beer over wine due to headaches/migraines.  So can't comment on the wine. Beer is good here though..

Just wish the bruschettas were not $13.50! 10 bucks would be a good price for lunch.."}
{"text":"I love going to Postinos! They have great $5 wine specials during the day and their bruschetta is amazing! I also really love their roast beef sandwich. It's a great place to sit on the patio when the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"Downtown Gilbert has been way too popular so we only go here once or twice a year for the Monday/Tuesday special. If you are signed up for Eposse it guarantees you a reservation and a dessert. 

For $20 we did the bruschetta (ricotta and dates / salmon and pesto / seasonal tomato jam and light cheese / prosciutto and figs) with a bottle of Malbec. We also shared the raspberry chicken salad. It's my favorite salad on the menu. We also shared the salted caramel dessert...tasty caramel with chocolate covered corn nuts and pretzels.

It gets really crowded but the service is spot on."}
{"text":"Great food and wine selection. We were so full with out that gross heavy feeling. 

Even when the wind and rain came in hard they handled it great and had positive attitudes. I was there with my sister, who is pregnant, and they got us sat inside ad quickly as they could. The whole staff seem to work together at covering the floor- and consider the whole restaurant as their \"section\". As a restaurant manager I can really appreciate that. It ensures that every guest is getting taken care of.

If I lived in the area this would be a new hang out for me. I certainly know my sister and husband will be enjoying future experiences there!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Postino Central (in Phoenix) and Postino Annex (in Tempe), so this was the third Postino location I visited.

The quality of the food was the same, but compared with the other Postino locations, I would say that this location was more dimly lit and the servers were younger. It felt more loud. There is more inside seating.

So far, I liked Postino Central the best because it was more quiet, and the patrons were older and thus, more calm. But this location has a lot more spaces to park your car and there are a lot of cool shops nearby that you can explore on foot.

Ten friends and I got a table near the entrance around 7pm on a Wednesday night. The place was completely full, and it was extremely noisy - I could barely hear the person in front of me.

I would probably come here when it's less packed and during the day time and probably with fewer friends."}
{"text":"Phenomenal lunch.  Everything made is fresh and delicious.  I had the red pepper soup, Hannah field salad and roast beef sandwich.  The selection of wines were nice.  It wins the fresh taste list with me and healthy choices are available on the menu."}
{"text":"Postino East is one of my favorite places!!! Had my birthday party there!! The wine and food are always awesome!!"}
{"text":"not sure. food is great. but the server who started out with us didn't finish is even though he just started. strange

i asked for ice as i wanted a chilled moscato that the original server told me was sweet & chilled. not sweet or chilled & the ice came once i was done with my wine! not good service.

soooooo my vote is out. i'll wait until my next visit to give my final vote."}
{"text":"This restaurant was AMAZING. I loved everything about it. The food was delicious - had the butchers board and the bruschetta. There was so many bruschetta options! The wine was very good as well. The atmosphere was so much fun. I loved the set up and the music was on point. Song after song that played made the experience that much better. The only downside was we had a long wait but it was a Friday so it was expected. Tried to make a reservation but they don't make them for parties less than 5. On the plus side got to drink our bottle of wine while we waited!"}
{"text":"I met up with the divine Aly d. to check out the new postinos east on Saturday 4/14 for a lovely lunch date. This is a great time to go because its not overly crowded early in the afternoon. . 

Imbibe:  we each ordered a glass of vino for five dollars and we both enjoyed very much. i went with a nice cab called bliss and Aly ordered a Zin. Wine is a must here.

I ordered a turkey panini, with smoked turkey, tomatoes, provolone, fresh greens and house made pesto....the sandwich was so delicious and the flavors of the pesto was not overpowering just right.  Aly ordered a soup and half a panini. the soup was an excellent choice since it was a cold & rainy day out.

as far as atmosphere..its not as hipster as the one in arcadia but still nice vibe. a couple next to us had a screaming toddler on their hands & poor mom had to leave to not disturb the other customers. I can tune it out for the most part however the ladies in front of us were clearly irritated and they were covering their ears with their hands...too funny that parents bring their kids to a bar to hangout.

overall I like that concept and the restaurant has a very open feel and its a welcome to gilbert. I probably would pop in during the weekday instead of weekend and will update if it improves to 5 star. By the way big thanks to my girl Aly for paying for my lunch!"}
{"text":"great place. got to get their early on their wine and prosciutto special night to get a decent seat. it gets crowded and a bit loud at times but the atmosphere is still nice for hanging out or even a date night. good location to walk old town gilbert while waiting for a table if you show up later."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to go and relax. The wine selection is good and the atmosphere is great.

The menu is very small and basic but the food is great."}
{"text":"We are visiting family in Mesa and were looking for a great place to eat. We are tired of the same big chain restaurants. This was a great experience. The staff was very prompt. The atmosphere is hip urban industrial with a comfortable feel. Happy hour was a great deal and the local beers were excellent. I had a very delicious panini with meats arugula and a little olive tapenade on ciabatta. My wife had the Ni√ßoise salad. We are foodies and this place blows away restaurants from Seattle to San Diego."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. The atmosphere is great, food is even better. Highly recommend the bruschetta. My favorites are the Brie and fig, salami and pesto, and artichoke! You cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"Very nice place to relax and drink a glass of wine! Staff is kind and very prompt... open atmosphere & trendy!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and overall vibe.  Definitely a place to come for a few hours away from kids!"}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this place. Very interesting food and lots of wine selections. We shared a bruschetta board and it was plenty for the two of us. The apple and Brie bruschetta is very sweet so save it till the end for \"dessert.\" Absolutely delicious. I'll definitely return. My only complaint is that the service was a little slow. I felt like we waited quit a while before someone took our food order, and the restaurant wasn't extremely busy."}
{"text":"Very nice sitting out on the patio.  The bruschetta was delicious.  I can't wait to go back and try some more things."}
{"text":"Bruschetta boards, $5 pitchers of beer.. enough said. Oh and their autostrada sandwhich was delicious too."}
{"text":"Great bruschetta and wine.  Very hipster and trendy.  Felt under dressed in my casual clothes at night.  Felt as though I should have worn jeans and heels.  Waiter was sort of high-brow, but nothing to complain about.  Fast service.

EDIT:  Enjoyed brunch at Postinos on Sunday...what a great find!  After being told the wait was over an hour at nearby restaurants, we noticed Postino was open...so we tried it!  VERY reasonable prices, much cheaper than I expected.  We had two kiddos with us, and they loved their food.  My entr√©e, my mimosa and my daughters meal and chocolate milk were $22 with tax!  Super fast service...left feeling like I didn't bust my diet, just right portions."}
{"text":"Great staff and superb food as well as one of the best happy hours in town."}
{"text":"K and I dropped off C for his rehearsal for the AYT production of Dracula. On this particular night Postino has the awesome deal of Bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20 after 8pm so we headed over. We were sat right away by a very pleasant hostess. Since we had 90 minutes before the Bruschetta/wine deal, we opted  to have a glass of wine and split a sandwich while we waited. K had the Perfekt Riesling ($11) and I had the Fable Sangiovese-Merlot ($10). Both wines were fine and we enjoyed sipping them and people watching. We thoroughly enjoyed the Roast Beef Panini ($10) as well. Super yummy. Before we knew it the 8 o'clock hour was upon us and we ordered our Bruschetta and bottle of wine. A perfect date night. The whole while many different servers came by, kept our water glasses full and basically made sure we were well-taken care off. One of the many great things about Postino is that all the servers are functioning as a team and they all seem to work towards the same goal, customer satisfaction. 
Time flew by and before long it was time to pick up C from rehearsal. Adam recorked our bottle of wine so we could take it home and we wrapped up another awesome time at Postino. Winner winner chicken dinner.
Awesome customer service. Great food. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Great location for a relaxing evening.

Postino's features bruschetta in many combinations as well as panini's.  The bruschetta bard comes with 4 bruschetta of your choice.The food is great, the wine selection is very good (ask for recommendations from the staff if you need it.)

The happy hour ends at 5:00, but they have $5 wines and $20/bottle.  Several nights a week, they feature a special after 8 for a bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta for $20.

The service is great and friendly."}
{"text":"Nice classy, perfect spot for catching up with the bestie. Bellini's, Mimosa's and Bruschetta Assorted Board was Divine."}
{"text":"Last night we decided to enjoy the amazing weather and eat outside. My friend also wanted to bring her dog who had been cooped up all day while they worked.  We called to confirm that they were dog friendly as they were listed here on Yelp.  We had a great time. Our waiter McKinley was GREAT as was all the waitstaff who stopped by to cuddle with the dog, they even brought out a little cup of sliced chicken for him.  Never disappointed here by the food or the service"}
{"text":"My parents and I are such a fan of Postinos East. We have come by on their busy Sunday mornings and they will do their best to try to get you seated quickly. Every time we have come here they have always gotten our order right, the food was delicious, great beer/wine selection. Their meat and cheese board with the artichoke dip on the side is delicious. Now that we have moved to the east valley, we will be coming here more often. Thank you Uptown Projects for expanding."}
{"text":"They had gluten free bread for the bruschetta and paninis.  There was also an outdoor area where the kids could play.  The outside areas don't have full tables.  They are little standing tables or coffee tables.  It was really nice at dinner time.  Perfect weather.  We also had  grilled vegetable appetizer, which was really yummy.  The waitress was great.  We were really worried we would get ignored outside but we weren't."}
{"text":"Great location in downtown Gilbert. Impressive outdoor seating area with nice ambiance. Fair Beer and wine selection. Don't see any hard stuff here. Underwhelmed by the menu. Bruschetta, panini's, and salads. That's about it. 

Olive starter. Panini. These were good, but not my idea of going out for dinner. Would be much more excited if it was lunch time. 

The place has tons of space both indoors and out. Great for large groups."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great wine! The atmosphere is relaxed with both indoor and outdoor seating. The only problem I've had is they don't have dedicated servers for the tables. Because of that if something doesn't get put in for your table it takes quite a while for someone to notice you didn't receive what you ordered."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place has amazing service, even better food, a great wine and beer selection, and has a perfect ambiance. Noisy and upbeat, but not overly-loud. This is a really fun place to go; my better half and I enjoy date nights here very much. :)

So why only 4 stars? Because unless you're going at 2pm on a Tuesday, be prepared to wait. Don't mind a wait? Well, you might mind a FOUR HOUR wait. Postino does not accept reservations - neither location does... Well, unless you have a group of eight hundred. With that in mind, this cannot be your last minute decision for happy hour at 6pm on any given night. This must be strategicailly planned - a mission, if you will. (Won't you please?) If your date or a member of your party can leave work at 3pm during the week to snag a table to hold until the rest of you arrive at 6pm, I'd advise that. 

The Arcadia location has valley which is pretty awesome - this location should take a hint. Parking is crazy!! You'd be better off just walking from home, actually."}
{"text":"We love Postino's haven't been in awhile but they changed up the ciabatta bread & didn't press the sandwich. Wasn't bad but was more like a sandwich then a panini. Please bring back the original ciabatta bread & press our paninis. We still love you though!"}
{"text":"The bruschetta is amazing. My favorite is the artichoke one. 
The East location also does an excellent job making gluten free food. The bruschetta can be made on tomatoes or green apples."}
{"text":"I was super excited when Postino East opened. Postino Central is amazing and I had high hopes for the East location. 

My friend and I decided to try them for Sunday Brunch....\"Meh\", is about as good as I can give it. The service was slow, the food menu limited and the drink menu even worse (no bloody marys on Sunday? WTH?) and there were flies everwhere. Gross! 

I am sure they're better for the evening fare, but brunch left a lot to be desired. :("}
{"text":"Amazing food and wine options. Bruschetta planks or the Mediterranean salad are my go to menu choices, but every time I try something new, I'm always pleasantly surprised. Indoor and outdoor seating options, and even a more lounge like grassy area to the side if you just want to chat and relax. Super dog friendly spot. We love to throw our pup in the backseat and take her with us for lunch. They offer puppy water and the staff always treats your dog like a welcomed guest! It's a team atmosphere (all servers pool tips) so you seem to get very consistent service since everyone is helping everyone. You do have a main server, but if your server isn't readily available and you need something, you don't have to feel bad about asking another walking by employee. One of my favorite date spots, meet up with the girlfriends, or really for any occasion. They have some great specials too! Monday and Tuesday nights are $20 for a bottle of wine and a plank of bruschetta, glasses of wine and pitchers of beer are $5 before 5pm everyday, and all day everyday they offer bellinis and mimosas for $5! Definitely worth checking out :)"}
{"text":"After I posted my review on the awful experience we had during our 1st visit together to the Gilbert location I was immediately contacted by a rep from Postino's who was very apologetic and took the time to hear my story , and invited us back on the house. I took my best friend with me for her birthday and from start to finish the service and food was absolutely divine, and exactly what you'd except if you've come to love the Postino's brand here in the valley. I decided to save my gift card for a night out with my husband,  so I should note that the staff had no idea I was coming back for a second try."}
{"text":"Some of the best bruschetta anywhere and on Monday and Tuesdy nights, they have a $20 Bottle & Board special. Any bottle of wine and board of 4 types of bruschetta. Awesome deal but expect it to be busy."}
{"text":"I planned a \"Bachelortte Dinner\" here and unfortunately they only take reservations for 8+ so I wasn't able to make a reservation. We arrived early, however, as expected there was a wait. The wait took longer than we had anticipated, which wouldn't have been an issue but we had a surprise party starting at 7pm sharp somewhere else. 

I let the hostess and server know and they made every effort to expedite our meal to get us out on time. I very much appreciated their efforts. They didn't have to hurry or help us out, but they did anyway. The food was delicious (as always) and the wine recommendation was great!"}
{"text":"After a couple of attempts to come here (too busy...man!) I finally went a couple weeks ago. The food is consistent with the other locations. I had the prosciutto and fig sandwich, it was good, but a bit too much prosciutto for my taste (I like a lighter hand with it, but I can see why they do it that way) and the italian salad, which is fairly good, but not my fave. Would like to get some bruschetta, but will probably frequent the central location now that I am moving out of the East valley. I like their open patio, and the misters help with the heat. I also am a fan of their fresh squeezed 5$ bellinis before 5 pm....very tasty."}
{"text":"We came for dinner, went to the bar while waiting for our table and enjoyed the bar so much we canceled the table.  The vibe at this place is awesome. Great music, fun decor, friendly staff, good food. Started with the butcher block which was very good. I had the tomato soup and it was amazing. Hubs had the potato soup and liked it too. We split the Nine Iron panini and it was just okay. Servers brought us someone else's food three times which became a little tiring.  Overall we really liked this place!"}
{"text":"Score! I was skeptical about this place but i was pleasantly surprised! 
Def would go back!"}
{"text":"Honestly, it was a fall back dinner choice. 

The decor inside is nice and welcoming. 
The music a little loud making everyone else talk louder (something I noticed enough to remember). 
It was very very busy and I was eating with wife almost instantly. 
They had delicious beer choices on tap which made me happy. 

I had the \"nine iron\" panini, and I argued with myself about whether it was the best sandwich I ever had (I think it won). The panini paired with the SanTan Amber perfectly. 

The service to get our food was quick albeit a little short when my wife didn't know the difference in ciabatta bread and focaccia bread. Also, we would have stayed and order more beer, but our staff didn't return for 20 minutes, both my wife and I with 0 beer. 

I hate that this sounds negative because my experience wasn't that negative. I'm just trying to point out the little things I noticed that bothered me. Still 4 stars in my book."}
{"text":"rockin brunch?...epic fail. We tried the rockin brunch today and considering the other choices in the area for breakfast I would never come here for breakfast again. The music was way too loud for a breakfast and after asking three times to have the music turned down we figured they just were not going to do it despite the fact that they said they would. The food was average at best. Would recommend Liberty Market or Farmhouse for breakfast instead."}
{"text":"Really love this place! I always have a good time whether it's date night or girls night. I love the bruschetta board and bellini's!"}
{"text":"Bruschetta, wine and delicious dessert! 

I have been a couple of times and haven't been disappointed thus far. I will say that it does get busy, because Gilbert, AZ is lacking alternative places to go to for good drink and atmosphere. So plan on waiting for a table at night. Otherwise, hit up the patio! 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants around! Great wine atmosphere, service and food! There is not much more you can ask for in a restaurant! Also, the wine deals on Tuesday nights are fantastic the only problem is you have to get there early or you end up waiting forever because the place is so dang popular. A must visit if you are in the downtown gilbert area!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Delicious food. Delicious wine. Great atmosphere. Bottle and board night on Monday and Tuesday nights is the best deal hands down. It appears to be busy all the time, therefore the wait time can be a little long, which is the only negative. The service has been great every time I've been...which is many times! Can't go wrong with any of the bruschetta options in my opinion. The paninis are also great, and the salted caramel sundae is so good you'll want to lick the caramel shooter to get every last drop of it."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  If you are opting out of wine, try the cucumber honey lemonade.  It is so crisp and refreshing!  You cannot go wrong with the bruschetta--my favorite is the roasted pepper and goat cheese.  I could have done without the toddlers on either side of us, but hey, when in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Happy hour is a great deal!

Their sandwiches are good, their wine is plentiful, the atmosphere is fun!  Typically a pretty long wait to get a table.  But fun and tasty.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Great Service, all employees are very personable. Wine selection is fantastic (Malbec was delicious) and I think my water was refilled 17 times in the span of one hour, Way to go. Can't go wrong with the Brushetta and definitely recommend the butchers board. Go on a nice night and sit on the patio for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"I love Postinos, and frequently go there on the weekend for brunch. Recently, I made a reservation to have my birthday dinner there with a total of 14 people. They sat us outside, which they warned me about when I made the reservation, but they assured me it would be plenty warm enough in January with the patio heaters. They were certainly right, and everyone I spoke to about it said they were more than comfortable. The waiters were extremely accommodating. With such a big group, I expected to have to have a single tab, but the main waiter said he could split it up by couple, which was very much appreciated with such a large group. The waiters came around often to refill drinks, clear dishes, and generally make sure we had everything we needed. The food and drinks were as great as they always are. Overall, I had such a great time, thanks to the staff at Postinos East."}
{"text":"This by far is one of the best wine bars around....Have been to both the Gilbert and Arcadia locations and both of them are great.  Was there last  night with friends from out of town, they loved it. Do not go there if you want a full bar..this bar only serves beer and wine!"}
{"text":"Showed up on Monday evening for the wine & bruschetta board special. I'm impressed! I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Our server was very attentive. Love the indoor/ outdoor seating! My one complaint would be the volume of the music.. it's hard to have a conversation if you have to shout across the table to be heard."}
{"text":".....after a personal and very prompt reach out by the general manager I will give a slightly better review. He's tried to make my bad experience right which is what customer service is all about. Will review again at a later date."}
{"text":"Loved this place! First timer that heard others ranting and raving how good this place was and it did hold up to the talk. I am not much of a wine person but this place has way more to offer than a good glass of wine. The atmosphere, open walls and fire places along with comfy, cozy couches to make you feel cozy at home like you are on your own outside patio. The food was delicious. I went with a large group of co-workers, we ordered a little bit of everything. I personally enjoyed the artichoke dip!! Yes we did have a 45min wait but as we waited, chairs were supplied and ice water was given plus you can order wine while you wait....and it does not require a walk to the bar, they come to you! I noticed lots of groups of women, yes it is probably more of a \"girly\" bar/restaurant, but men if you want to cater to you lady....I think this would make you score some extra points. Service was excellent, very friendly and timely with drinks and food once we were seated."}
{"text":"We headed over to Postino East after a long meeting in Gilbert. We had the bruschetta - four different toppings and the butcher's block. Service was great, food was fabulous and the manager could not have been nicer.
Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! I would go back for appetizers and drinks, I was not impressed with the entre options... I would recommend this place for lunch, as it is more of a sandwich/salad type of place...."}
{"text":"Was here with a large group last week. Everyone wasn't completely sure it was the right place because they don't have a sign yet, but it is right across the street from Liberty Market and Joe's BBQ on the northwest corner. I don't recommend coming with a large group because you are not able to hear anyone but the person you are yelling at next to you, due to the music being really REALLY loud. I certainly don't mind loud music, but this was loud enough that I was looking for a dance floor. My voice was squeaky and raw by the time I left due to how loudly I had to talk. How can you have a good time and enjoy a meal when you are screaming into the face of the person next to you?

As for the food- EXCELLENT. You get plenty for the price too, totally worth it.  Also love that you can get a \"shorty\" glass of brew for a reasonable price. I'm happy there is another happenin' place in Downtown Gilbert, but I can't go beyond 3 stars. That's how much the noise turned me off."}
{"text":"Good food but expensive drinks. $13 for a standard wine is ridiculous.
I had the Turkey panini. Pretty and my wife had a combo plate. Nice portions for $11 each..."}
{"text":"OMG! This is one of my new favorite places!! Happy Hour every day from 11am to 5pm is fantastic.  Tried the bruschetta board, loved every one I had, each one is fantastic in its one way.  All the flavors are perfectly balanced.  The bread is soft but holds up and doesn't get soggy, it was absolute perfection!"}
{"text":"The noun bruschetta comes from the Roman dialect verb, \"bruscare,\" meaning 'to roast over coals.'

Postino's has always been my favorite Upward Projects establishment.  Ever since I stepped foot into their Arcadia 1950's post office location, I was hooked.  While it's been a few years since I've been inside a Postino's, all it took was one bite of bruschetta to make me feel that same old love again.

I. Love. Bread.  Even more than Oprah!  Top it with some good stuff and I'm hooked.  You can get four choices (out of twelve), cut into fourths, for $14.75.  Don't feel like bruschetta? Try the Butcher's Block, a Cheese Board, or The Bounty for you crudit√©s loving fiends.  They also have paninis, soups, salads, and dessert.  To be noted, they also offer gluten-free bread for an upcharge.  Wine, beer, mimosas, and bellinis are served so have a drink while you eat.  If you're not into booze, I hear their Honey Cucumber Lemonade is refreshing.

All in all, I love Postino's.  Take a friend, take a lover, take your mother, or just take your bad ass self. Just get over to your nearest Postino's and eat some bruschetta!"}
{"text":"This is my first time in Arizona and we were staying at a hotel in Gilbert. We originally were going to eat at Snooze Eatery but changed our mind at the last minute. We were seating quickly and greeted with nothing but smiles.  The peace bellini was on of the best I have had and I definitely suggest the roast beef panini. All in all I was pleased with my visit."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here last night for dinner... Holy moly it was so great! 
The atmosphere is lovely and has a bit of a posh feel to it, with seating inside and out on the patio. The tables (inside and out) had tea lights on them which added to the relaxed feel. 
Despite how crazy busy it was, we were seated right away and chose to sit out on the patio. The place was also quite open, surprisingly, regardless of how packed it was.

Our waitress was awesome, very knowledgeable about the menu (considering we hadn't been there before) and was really polite and friendly. The manager  made his rounds throughout the night and also stopped by our table to make sure everything was okay... the service was really impressive!

I got the \"Nine Iron\" panini on focaccia bread (sans tomato and condiments) which came with a side salad and a choice of dressing (I got the herb vinaigrette) and I got an iced tea as well.

SO, first thing's first: the panini. It was HUGE (and delicious). On the sandwich was bacon, chicken, fresh mozzarella, and lettuce. It was seriously glorious, and I couldn't even finish it; I ended up taking half home. 
The side salad was basic, but the herb vinaigrette made it heavenly. I typically eat all my salads dry because I don't enjoy dressing, but this was just so good. It is made in-house from a lemon and mustard base. 
I am also pretty sure they put crack in the iced tea because dear god it was amazing. I don't know how they brew it, but it was the best iced tea I'd ever had. 
My friends shared a panini and a selection of the bruschetta, and were also in food heaven. 

The price was very reasonable, with my meal costing about $17, including tip. I'm sure if you were to get wine or something of that sort, the bill would add up easily, but for what my friends and I got, it was really decently priced.

I am absolutely coming here again!"}
{"text":"Close friend and I visited Postino for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon to catch up with each other. I had never been the downtown Gilbert area but I will be coming back for sure to visit this place. It has an urban wine loft feel, they have a beautiful airy patio, bruschetta and appetizers served on wooden chopping boards. I kept mistakenly referring to it as \"Positano\" after the seaside Italian town, because it looks like a place that could BE in Italy. 
The staff was friendly and fast. We ordered the soup/salad combo for $10: the \"soup of the moment\" was delicious as well as the mixed greens salad. Tip: 11am - 5pm all week they have $5 glasses of wine and $5 mimosas/bellinis. 
Definitely planning on coming back to try $20 bottle of wine nights on Monday/Tuesday.
Who says you can have enough wine?"}
{"text":"It's a little too busy on the weekends for my tastes, but I cannot think of a better place to go for a nice, enjoyable dinner with friends on a weeknight. The last time I was there, we had several waves of food and drinks, and we stayed for a long time and enjoyed every minute. Go when you can sit outside!"}
{"text":"My father in law brought us here on our latest trip to Arizona, and we absolutely loved our meal.

The standout - as I'm sure everyone says - is the bruschetta. Both my fianc√© and father in law got a sampling of four each - I tried several and enjoyed all of them. The key is not only the great variety of flavor combinations, but that each one is artfully put together - the tastes and the visual presentation. I was very impressed. Ask for the server's recommendations - ours definitely steered us to what was special on the menu that day.

I got a nicoise salad which was perfectly good. It was filled with lots of fresh ingredients, and I enjoyed it. It just couldn't hold a candle to the bruschetta!

Our servers were nice and waters stayed full. Water was filtered, too, which we had found not every restaurant in the area does. We sat outside on a lovely sunny fall day, and it was nice, although if the heat is too much for you, indoor seating is limited.

Wine selection looked good, though I didn't have any. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Postino East . . . the best effort by the owners of the restaurant group to date! We've been a fan since the original opened in Arcadia, but now we have one in our own \"hood!\"!! Yippee! Our brunch today (Easter Sunday) was as perfect as any other Sunday. We sat at the bar and the service by Chandler and Daniel was like every other time we'd sat at the bar . . . perfect and professional. Always a delight to dine there!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch.  Love the Bruschetta boards! Salads and panini great also.  Pleasant outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Always friendly service. Good suggestions and selections for beer and wine. Tiny but yummy menu. Way too loud. Music is so loud, every table has to yell to be heard. Probably okay for some, too much for me."}
{"text":"I hesitate to write a review, only because I don't want to share my little hidden gem. I'm in love, I wish I knew more people who didn't have to  work during happy hour, $5 glasses of wine are hard to pass up. The peach Bellini is super sweeeet, but a nice change of pace from the usual. The ladies I dined with seemed to enjoy the white blend on the servers suggestion (and when he suggests a bottle, just do it - its worth it's weight in gold on the experience scale.). 

How could I forget the bruschetta? Uh hello!! A may za zing.. I can't get enough, such delicious combinations and choices. The experience is endless, I can't wait to go back.. 








Lastly, my little secret. The Gilbert location has an outdoor bachi (sp?) ball court, they have a few tables set up outside, so bringing the kids is an option. The servers are attentive and must know women day drinking $5 glasses of wine with their children in tow are very generous (always responsibly obviously)...there's something to be said about a place that kids are allowed to play and mommy time is equally valued.

I wanna go back for date night with the hubs or cocktails with friends without kids next time (just  to get the full experience, nothing to do with the aforementioned $5 happy hour glasses of wine) ;)"}
{"text":"Well, I'm not sure how I feel about this place. The night didn't start off to well since they didn't honor our reservation (I know they don't usually let you reserve a table but since we were a large group they said they would). We ended up at two small tables pushed together which was not at all enough room for the nine of us. But we made do and once we had ordered a couple of bottles of wine we got a little more comfortable. The $20 for a bottle of wine and board of bruscetta is such a great deal. Two of us had coupons for free bruscetta boards in addition to that so we had ourselves a feast. By the end of the night, we had 6 boards of bruscetta and three bottles of wine and the bill only came out to about a hundred bucks. Not bad for 9 people!!! Plus they even gave us a free dessert for the birthday girls!

I think I prefer the atmosphere at the Central location and to be honest I think the food is a little better there as well (even though its the same menu, I just mean the preparation). However, Postino in Gilbert is a-ok in my book."}
{"text":"Definitely five stars for this place.  What's that, you want to know more?

Let me tell you  - an amazing wine list, with champagnes and all wines $5 per glass during happy hour?  And amazing appetizers and salads?  The most amazing, friendly, and funny staff I have seen in years? A beautiful interior, great location, and absolutely fabulous outdoor patio?  YES.  PLEASE.

I wish I would have found this place sooner during my travels. I would have ate here every single meal.  

Parking is plentiful in Gilbert streets.  Is there a down side?  Well, the menu descriptions (and ingredient choices) are woefully hipster.  That may turn off some.  The food and drink we had, however, was fantastic."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. The bread for the bruschetta was 2 inches thick and the toppings just seemed to be lacking in every way. Not sure what all the fuss is, the hour wait was not worth it."}
{"text":"You got to love the ambiance in this place. Wish they had a sign so I could have found this place faster. Very cool design of the restaurant. The food looks very good. My partner and I just stopped by for some wine. It is a very cool place to hang out especially if you are a 30 something, which I am not.

I will go back to try the food and more of their wines. I am anxious for a very positive result!"}
{"text":"You know you've driven by Postino's in downtown Gilbert and have seen ALL those people on the dining patio with a line waiting to get in. You know you've wondered, \"Is it really THAT good?\" I'm here to confirm yes, it most certainly is. 

I've been here a couple times with friends, and most recently with my sister for brunch. Top notch every time. The menu offers sandwiches, brunch, and the bruschetta for which they are famous (and rightfully so). Sit inside or outside, and enjoy a fantastic glass or bottle of wine from their excellent list. 

When the weather is nice, the huge front glass will be opened and the inside and outside seating areas seem to become one. Outside seating offers a large fireplace in the winter, and misters in the summer. The back even has a seating area on fake grass for the kiddos to play around. The atmosphere cannot be beat. One of my very favorite foodie spots in Gilbert. 

This Postino location has great parking options--look for spots back by the Gilbert water tower where you park for the Gilbert Farmers Market."}
{"text":"They don't take reservations for less than eight people, and it's always slammed for dinner.  So if you'd like to wait an hour for your party of 7 or fewer to eat, go right ahead and eat here.  I'm sure this place is good .. for Gilbert.  But I can get reservations at any restaurant in Kierland on short notice.  Do yourself a favor and make the drive half an hour North for better food and customer service."}
{"text":"I ordered a vegetarian sandwich. It was very disappointing as was the service. The sandwich had a few small pieces of veges. It was like eating a slices of bread with a hint of veges. Overpriced food! Nice location and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience we just had at Postino East! Lunch was absolutely delicious and the service was outstanding! We ordered the Nine Iron Sandwich and our server suggested adding avocado, which made it extra delicious! The iced tea kept coming, which made us especially happy on this hot summer day! Thank you, Postino for making our lunch memorable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"They seem to ALWAYS be busy, which in itself should say something. Went there for the 4th time last night, and they had their normal special (which I think they said is Sun, Mon & Tues), of spend $20 on a bottle and get a board of brochette. We had another couple with us, so ordered 3 bottles of wine and 3 boards (each board with 4 different kinds of brochette on it). I only give it 4 stars, because they sometimes are very slow. And, their selection of wine is a bit limited. Only carrying one brand of each type of wine."}
{"text":"Scott was our server. We sat at the bar. He was very nice and personable.  The bruchetta dish was amazing. A like party in your mouth. We tried the apple one, the prosciutto, the tomato jam, and the pistachio. The pistachio was my least fav, but the other 3 were ridiculously tasty! Try the bruchetta and the different combinations. A must!"}
{"text":"Great place. The service was superb. The bruschetta we started with was fantastic. My favorite had prosciutto figs and cheese. Delicious. I thought the prosciutto brie and fig jam panini was to die for. Although it's a wine bar we drank beer because that's more my style and they had a great selection of craft and local beers and its only 7.50 for a pitcher.

More than the food and drink the ambience was great such a pleasant outdoor seating area with live music. I appreciated the very chill nature of the place and think this is a great place to hang out and have a leisurely meal with friends. Very hip vibes but no too pricey and a diverse crowd.

Wish I was a local because if so this would be my new hang out."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and the food was fantastic.  My friend was able to bring her dog to the outside patio and we relaxed and enjoyed some delicious food.  My friend goes here quite often for their wine and I can't wait to join them as if breakfast is any indication, it will be amazing.  Staff is extremely friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Last Saturday night my wife went over to Postino to check it out. We have lived in Gilbert for several years and have seen this location as a revolving door for restaurant concepts. In my opinion,  Postino pinpointed the right demographic and location and delivered in a big way. From the time we were greeted to the time we left we had a top notch experience. The wait was about 20-25 minutes on a Saturday night around 7:30. We sat outside on a day that it was around 110 and with the misters we were totally comfortable. My wife and I loved the simplicity of the menu - starters, salads, panninis, bruschetta, dessert... EASY. We both ordered salads, I had the Field Greens with Chicken, she had the Mediterranean. Both were artfully presented, fresh and delicious. We loved the atmosphere, music and upbeat vibe flowing through the place. I asked to speak to the GM or Manager to convey our thoughts - 2 energetic guys came out to greet my wife and I. Phil and Cristobal, both managers came out and we let them know that we had found our \"new place\" - they both were excited and you could tell they were passionate about what they are doing with Postino. We'll definitely be going back and have already made plans to make it over to the Arcadia location."}
{"text":"Postinos is ALWAYS good! Consistently great service, great food, great beer and wine! It's the perfect place to go when the weather is great, their patio is awesome. But really it's great anytime!"}
