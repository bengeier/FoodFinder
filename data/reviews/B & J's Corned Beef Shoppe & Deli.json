{"text":"Had breakfast here again this morning . Great as usual . Love the hot cakes and they use good syrup . I'm typically here once or twice a week ."}
{"text":"I love this place! So many memories with my papaw! I've been going their since I was a little girl , and it's owned by the same owner. The soups are home made, and they serve breakfast all day! Not to mention the prices can't be beat! You have to stop in and see Gus if your in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little diner. The food was fabulous,  and our server was very friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this small diner is listed as a corned beef shoppe & deli. It's actually a greasy spoon. The cook was extremely rude and only knows how to do things one way. Our breakfast food was greasy and tasteless all in one. Yuk!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here on our first breakfast date and I fell in love with this place. It's a mom n pop kind of stop. The people here are friendly. We always order the western omelette with cheese, home fries and sausage gravy. Nom Nom heaven to begin the day. I honestly have no complaints for this place. Still curious about the other items on their menu but its hard to hold back in that nomilicious omellette lol. Food cooked with home made love."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best corned beef reuben I've ever had. The rye was toasted perfectly. The corned beef was tasty and moist, not dry like some places. The sauerkraut was delicious and the cheese was melted perfectly! And let's not forget the Russian dressing... just FANTASTIC! Found this place on Yelp! (Thank you fellow Yelpers!) Needed to grab a quick delicious bite to go as we head out of town and B&J's NAILED IT! Also, even though we ordered our food to go, I must comment on how spotlessly clean the establishment was! We will definitely come back on our next trip to Cleveland!"}
