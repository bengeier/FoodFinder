{"text":"From Michigan, buying a car down the road. We came here to burn some time. First impression wasn't bad seemed like a typical diner. We ordered water, both of ours had stuff floating in them   we ordered the poppers as a starter, not horrible, just the normal frozen poppers.  I ordered the chicken strips and fries, because how can you mess those up....... they get to our table and they are all cut up, I'm guessing to check if they were done.  My boyfriend got a western omelet, he said it wasn't bad, but wasn't good. I think they need to look into a new chef to amp up the menu."}
{"text":"$12.49 for a REAL crappy cheese burger and frozen onion rings....lol, come on!  I could went to BSpot and had a world class Chef prepare it for less, and had a million times better quality.  I was offended."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and service.   A nice local restaurant for breakfast and lunch"}
{"text":"4 Keys, but 1 STAR!  Came for Fish fry, Left offended!! I'll start w/ the good points: fast service, updated decor, umm.. new menus.  Now for the long list of offenses: 1) Only 1 vegetarian dinner option!! Wife forced to order grilled cheese.. ouch. Came w/ chips.. ouch.  $5 2) Yeah there was the \"salad bar\", but was pitiful especially at $7.   3) Kid got grilled cheese too, w/ fires. $3.75.. ?? the adult version (same size) was more $ but came w/ less! 4) No salad bar option for kids, u can only add it for $4.  5) & the buffet cart was from the 70's and looked bad.  6) TV was on facing us playing The Gladiator with a blood bath war scene of killing.. great for my 8 yr old!! 7) Fish (frozen ocean Perch) came out soft w/ warm coleslaw and non-crunchy frozen gross crinkle fries which I ordered extra crispy! Same story w/ kid's fries.  8) Skinny Onion rings were also boxed/frozen = not good.  Plus only got 5 of em for $4.   9) Everything tasted like really old grease.. you shouldn't actually taste the frying oil over the fish or potato.  10) Wife's pickle was embarrassing, decrepit, non edible.  11) I reluctantly asked for refill on perch since I paid the extra for 'endless', and it came out in under 30 seconds! Oh boy obviously it was just sitting under a warmer.  12) & she forgot my roll but was probably for the best.  Summary.. everything frozen, nothing tasted good.   If you're reading this, 4 Keys, please make changes!"}
{"text":"Went here the other day. Do they let appearances fool you, this is a hidden gem! Delicious, soul healing food is amazing. I love that they serve breakfast all day! We had the southern omelet, and it was HUGE. The omelet was cooked perfectly, veggies were over abundant. Yum. The hash browns were the icing on the cake. Delicious!!!  Yes, the place is run down. Yes, the place looks gross. Yes, you wouldn't take a first date here. But it's a great little hole in the wall spot where I will gladly return to for a quick bite and a great cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Lovely little diner. Great service, quality food, reasonably priced. We've been happy with the breakfast, lunch & dinner menus & options, and everyone is willing to please."}
{"text":"This place is a great value breakfast stop.  I eat breakfast here every weekend. They're open by 7, the food is always fresh, hot, and taste great. The service is friendly and on the spot.  The building is older and the decor is nothing special but they keep it clean."}
{"text":"What a jem!! Such friendly and fast service! There is a variety of food to choose from and it all tastes so good. For being a small little ma and pa restaurant I am impressed!"}
